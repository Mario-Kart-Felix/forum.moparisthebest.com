Why do you think you deserve to use it?
What Is your skill level with linux?
Is your server ready to go and get started?
In average how many donations per month do you get?( if currently online)

              <p>He’s either stealing servers, ips, or in it for the money. It’s probably a 8$ VPS and he wants a server with 100+ people for lots of donations…</p>

              <p>You are not very known on this forum and even tho rep doesn’t mean much having 6 is usually not a good sign.<br>
I’m sorry if i’m wrong but it seems to me that you’re trying to steal someone else’s server.<br>
You’re asking for how much donations the server has and how many players so my bet would be that you’re trying to get the owners account and make people donate to you.</p>
