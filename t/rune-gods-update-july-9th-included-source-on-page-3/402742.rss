    <description>[b]-Rune Gods-[/b]

[b]Introduction:[/b]
Rune Gods is a RSPS like no other. Prepare for a revolution in the way that RuneScape private servers are made. Of course, like with all my previous projects, this will be released completely open source. this goes for the server as well as the client.

[b]Overview:[/b]
Rune Gods is a server/client that has implementation on the actual RuneScape servers, and will connect using their servers thus there will be no need for a vps and the rsps will update along with actual RuneScape.[Note if you edit the source this will be disabled. If you decide to update then your source will be deleted and you will have to program your changes all over again.]

[b]What exactly does that mean?[/b]
This means that your server base will be RuneScape! 

[b]How will I do this?[/b]
‘‘This is imposible!’’ Most of you will say, but actually it is quite simple. I got the idea while looking at the open source RuneScape client. Using this source I have created a client that sends a split ip hack. What this does is connects to a RuneScape world of your choosing, then inserts a dupe ip that is sent back to your client folders with a source file. The source file is yours to edit. You will be able to edit anything you want!

[b]What if someone chooses the same world as me?[/b]
The client will detect any other clients connected to the world and if it finds any it will search for one that is open.

[b]How will i get others to connect to my specific client?[/b]
There two types of clients: A Master Client and a Child Client. What you will do with the master client is choose a world and get the split ip. Then in the child client they will enter that ip and connect.

[b]Does it work?[/b]
So far yes and no. i have it to where it connects, gets the ip and server files, but when you run the server and try to connect it says hack detected and automatically disconnects. Ibelieve I can fix this but it might take some time. Im currently searching through the source to see if i can find the block and delete it.

[b]Cant JaGeX detect this?[/b]
Lol duh, but there is nothing they can do about it! The reason being is the split ip hack :). Of course they will detect it and say &quot;Ok where is the hack coming from&quot; they are gonna be confused as hell when they realize its their ip lol. They only way they can shut off your server, is if they shut off theirs. PWNED NOOBS!

[b]SERVER SOURCE DOWNLOAD!!![/b] http://up.ht/qDbAsO
Will release client when its complete

[size=12pt][b]Release coming soon! More Images in the morning![/b][/size]

If you flash the kernel maybe for a few seconds whilst it’s confused you could proxy and tunnel the binaries and make the file on local dick but this is risky because if they catch you you’re fucked.</p>

              <p>So, implying that your idea actually works, what do you plan to do with having the exact same thing as Runescape. You’ll never have editable spawns, shops, or even experience rate. I hope you understand that they don’t send all of their editable source code to your computer. Nothing you’ll want from this will ever work, if you want it to. While it’s a decent concept it won’t work and you’re just wasting your time.</p>
