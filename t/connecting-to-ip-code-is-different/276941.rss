    <title>Connecting to ip, code is different</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connecting-to-ip-code-is-different/276941</link>
    <description>Ok, well i have 2 clients. And 1 worked but it was for my other server and the code for the ip was
[code]System.out.println(&quot;Connecting to Undetainable&#39;s Server&quot;);
Serverip = &quot;undetainable.no-ip.biz&quot;;
sign.signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getByName(Serverip));[/code]

And this other client for my new server the code is
[code]System.out.println(&quot;Connecting to Stickay Scape&quot;);
//launchURL&quot;stickayscape.no-ip.biz&quot;;
sign.signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getByName(Serverip));[/code]

The second client for my new server doesn&#39;t connect. I change the ip on the 1st client and tried but it didnt work either. Im thinking its serverside but i dont really know. If someone could help i&#39;d appreciate that.</description>
