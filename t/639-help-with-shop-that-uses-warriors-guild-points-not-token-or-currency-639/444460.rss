    <description>So the other day i was trying to add a npc that asked you what you wanted and would deduct warriors guild tokens(a new variable i created) from you and give you the item that you chose like this 
[img]http://i.imgur.com/rPRdh.png[/img]
but there is a problem
i tried to make it so that when you gained a token from the animatior minigame
it would add the points to a variable Wgtoken

it was like this:
[code]@Override
                                    public void execute() {
                                        stop();
                                        player.getSettings().getTokens()[2] += armour.getReward();
}[/code]

so i changed it to 

[code]                                    @Override
                                    public void execute() {
                                        stop();
                                        player.getSettings().getTokens()[2] += armour.getReward();
			  player.getDefinition().getWgtokens() += armour.getReward();
										
                                    }[/code]
but then it says unexpected type : found value
required variable

but im pretty shure that Wgtoken is a variable  and what does it mean by value? isnt variables values?

im not shure what it means and what should i do to add  this shop/npc 
if you have any ideas how i can use this warriorguild points to make an npc which only sellsstuff

thanks in advance  ;) ;)

p.s the variable Wgtoken is the same type of variable like donor or rights like if you wanted to change it to 30 for example you would like do this
[code]			player.getDefinition().setWgtokens(30);[/code]
and i believe if you wanted to write a if statement to check if it is below 10000 you would write like:
[code]if (player.getWgtoken() &gt;=1000 )[/code]</description>
