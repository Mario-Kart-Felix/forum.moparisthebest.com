    <description>I looked up a tutorial on how to make a door open, and this is what i put for the door on the left(from the outside) on Lumbridge Castle.
[code=cfg]door = 3217	3218	1516	-3	0	0	1	0[/code]

I&#39;m trying to learn this as soon as possible, but I really have no idea how to make this work. Can somebody send me in the right direction so I can learn?

Help would seriously be appreciated.</description>
