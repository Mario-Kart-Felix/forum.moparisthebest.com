    <description>Sorry guys im new to this but i have stupid questions
1.what file is the pickup command go on a 614 server
2. Can anyone give me the code for pickup on a 614 server because the current one wont work at all
3.where are the player files on a 614 server

Sorry for dumb questions because i know nothing about a 614 server

*Edit* Yes I did give good efort torwards it but i was hoping a 614 server would have that command built in but since i have to use backwards apostraphy to enter in my codes it can be frustrating</description>
