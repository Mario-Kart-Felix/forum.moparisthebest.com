    <title>Internet speed test</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/internet-speed-test/283686</link>
    <description>Hi... I haven&#39;t been around for quite awhile... And I haven&#39;t been around SCAR for even longer  :P

So, I&#39;ll make this a short story.

I&#39;ve been using my blackberry as a modem for my laptop. And yesterday I got a wild hair up my ass and decided to bridge the connection over to the LAN port on my laptop so I could play me some 360 at my girlfriends house(no internet there... pfft.). Now, I&#39;m super lazy and I don&#39;t like to do too much, and it&#39;s just kind of a pain in the ass sitting there connecting/disconnecting from the internet until a decent server is found... So I have a script for reconnecting/disconnecting, but the problem is the speed tester that I found(I think on sourceforge) only checks the AVERAGE speed, and I want to find the highest speed it hit. Not sure how to do that one, My guess is with the ReadConnectionData.

Well this is what I have...

[code]
function speedtest : double;
var
html,url : string;
starttime,endtime,difference,speed : integer;
begin
  starttime := GetSystemTime;
  url := &#39;http://sixhoej.net/speedtest/1024kb.txt&#39;;
  html := GetPage(url);
  endtime := GetSystemTime;
  difference := Round((endtime - starttime) / 1000);
  speed := Round(1024/difference);
  Result := speed/128;
end;
[/code]

Shorter story: the above determines AVERAGE speed, I would like to know the fastest download speed it has achieved, any help on this one? (FYI: it returns speed in megabit/s)

Thanks :)
