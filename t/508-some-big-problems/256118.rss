    <description>Hello.

1.Problem 
About Monsters Drops
I added all monsters drop items but if i am the first person to login to server then i only get drops it doesnt matter where i am or do i even kill this npc,I want to somehow change it to that who inflicts the most damage will get the drop.

2.Problem
About Wilderness
I got wilderness working but i wont get loot if i kill someone they keep their stuff at dieing.How and where i could change it so they lose items at dieing.And i dont got Attack Option if i click Follow it attacks.

3.Problem
About Trading
I think i cant fix this because all sources i have downloaded dont have working trade system but if anybody want to help me fix it then add me at msn Silverrson@hotmail.com

OKay those were all my problems i hope i get answers :)
