    <description>[size=20]Hi, im in 10th grade and I really need to pass this Take-Home Quiz.[/size]I only have 1 hour before I go to bed. (I have a football game at 8:30AM Tommorow)

[size=20]Heres the Questions. (I KNOW THEY ARE DUMB)[/size]

1. One day, a person went to horse racing area, Instead of counting the number of human and horses, he instead counted 74 heads and 196 legs. Yet he knew the number of humans and horses there. How did he do it, and how many humans and horses are there?

2. y = log x 
If y = 10, then what is x?

3. 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 10! 
Can this be true?! Why or why not?

4. If 1/2x +1/2(1/2x + 1/2(1/2x +1/2(1/2x + ... = y, 
then x = ? 

What place in this world can have their temperatures Fahrenheit and Celsius equal?

6. If x*x + 2x - 35 = 0, 
then x = ? 


7. If ax*x + bx +c = 0, 
then what is x? 
 

8. What is the area of a regular hexagon with sides 1 in. long? 


9. You have two block of clay in cube form and the edges are 10 cm. How many spheres with a radius of 5 cm can you make with that amount of clay? 


10. Every month, a girl gets allowance. Assume last year she had no money, and kept it up to now. Then she spends 1/2 of her money on clothes, then 1/3 of the remaining money on games, and then 1/4 of the remaining money on toys. After she bought all of that, she had $7777 left. Assuming she only gets money by allowance, how much money does she earn every month?

<p>Every month, a girl gets allowance. Assume last year she had no money, and kept it up to now. Then she spends 1/2 of her money on clothes, then 1/3 of the remaining money on games, and then 1/4 of the remaining money on toys. After she bought all of that, she had $7777 left. Assuming she only gets money by allowance, how much money does she earn every month?</p>

<p>A horse has 4 legs and 1 head.<br>
A human has 2 legs and 1 head. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
you need 2 equations -<br>
suppose X is the number of human heads, and y is the number of horse heads<br>
x + y =  74 (means number of human heads + number of horse heads = 74)<br>
2x + 4y = 196 (for every human head there are 2 human legs, correct? for every horse head there are 4 horse legs. this means 2x becomes the human legs because 1 human has 1 head and 2 legs. and for horse… you know what I mean)<br>
Then you rearrange the equation of “x + y = 74” to “y = 74 - x”, or you can also do that with x. (just like 2 + 3 = 5, to 3 = 5 - 2) you do this to give the value of y.<br>
You go back to the equation “2x + 4y = 196” and you SUBSTITUTE “y” with the first equation (y = 74 - x)<br>
=&gt; so<br>
2x + 4y = 196<br>
=&gt; 2x + 4(74 - x) = 196 (from the first equation)<br>
=&gt; 2x + 296 - 4x = 196<br>
=&gt; 2x - 4x = 196 - 296<br>
=&gt; -2x = -100<br>
=&gt; x = -100 / -2<br>
=&gt; x = 50 (both negatives cancel out)<br>
So number of  human heads (humans in other words) = 50, and horses = 24.</p>

<p>I have no idea what log is.</p>

<p>Stupid question</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nowhere. Celsius and Fahrenheit have different scales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>x*x + 2x - 35 = 0<br>
=&gt; (x-5)(x+7) = 0 (a little trick for factorizing hehe see the both x’s on the brackets? Means x multiplied by x because everything in the bracket gets multiplied with the other bracket. You get the -5 and +7 from the +2 because -5 + 7 = 2. -5 and 7 multiplied gives - 35. Just a little trick to do it easily.)<br>
=&gt; x = 5 (because in “(x-5)” 5 -5 = 0. And if 1 bracket is 0, the whole equation is 0, since 0 x anything = 0).<br>
or x = -7( because (-7 + 7) = 0)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to know what a and b and c is first. Then just follow the formula at question 6. ^</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t know how to convert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate area of cube. Calculate area of sphere. Divide area of cude by area of square. (depends on your question because if you can squash the clay then you will use that formula but if you can’t, it’s hard to tell how many spheres you can make)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3/4 of x = $7777. Calculate x.<br>
2/3 of y = x. Calculate y.<br>
1/2 of y = z. Calculate z.<br>
And z is her original allowance.</p>
</li>

<p>From wikipedia:<br>
The factorial function is formally defined by<br>
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/6/f06eb9403ca1f410055f763de0b6bd9f.png" alt width="187" height="55"></p>
<p>The above definition incorporates the instance</p>
<pre><code>0! = 1 \ 
</code></pre>
<p>as an instance of the fact that the product of no numbers at all is 1. This fact for factorials is useful, because</p>
<pre><code>* the recursive relation (n + 1)! = n! \times (n + 1) works for n = 0;
* it allows simple construction of expressions for infinite polynomials, e.g. 
</code></pre>

* this definition makes many identities in combinatorics valid for zero sizes.<br>
o In particular, the number of combinations or permutations of an empty set is, simply, 1.</p>

              <p>What place in this world can have their temperatures Fahrenheit and Celsius equal?<br>
F = 1.8C + 32<br>
x = 1.8x + 32<br>
x - 1.8x = 1.8x + 32 - 1.8x<br>
-0.8x = 32<br>
-8x = 320<br>
x = -40</p>
<p>Wherever it is -40 I guess.</p>
<p>What is the area of a regular hexagon with sides 1 in. long?</p>
<p>cba to work it out, but you draw it and split it into 2 triangles and a rectangle which makes it easy to do.</p>
<p>You have two block of clay in cube form and the edges are 10 cm. How many spheres with a radius of 5 cm can you make with that amount of clay?</p>
<p>Volume of a 10cm^3 cube = 1000cm cubed</p>
<p>edit: Oops there are 2 of them, which means 2* 1000cm cubed</p>
<p>Volume of a sphere when r = 5</p>
<p>V= 4/3(pie)r^3<br>
=523.6cm cubed</p>
<p>2000/523.6 = 3.6</p>
<p>What number shows up most often when you roll 10 dice?</p>
<p>I’m not quite sure what this is asking, but I’m assuming it means you roll 10 dice a bunch of times, and working out which aggregate from 2-60 occurs the most amount of times.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of is working out how many combination can add up to each number. The number of possible combinations should rise, peak at just above 30 and then drop again which will make things much easier.</p>
<p>If you want to go further, the chance of any particular number being rolled is (1/6)^10 * the number of combinations.</p>

If y = 10, then what is x?</p>

<p>10<em>9</em>8<em>7</em>6<em>5</em>4<em>3</em>2*1 = 10!<br>
Can this be true?! Why or why not?</p>

Then she spends 1/2 of her money on clothes, then 1/3 of the remaining money on games, and then 1/4 of the remaining money on toys. After she bought all of that, she had $7777 left. Assuming she only gets money by allowance, how much money does she earn every month?</p>
