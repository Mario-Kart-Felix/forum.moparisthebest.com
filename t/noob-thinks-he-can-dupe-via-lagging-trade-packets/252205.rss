              <p>Ha Bah Gee is retarded. Back when I was working on a bot, now I no longer have the time, I said I’d give it to W12ath for Jaghax, I didn’t care about the site. The project was just a project for me to do, not for anyone else. He got one noob who already had a bot, but it was just ripped sources, I got rid of him. Then comes this kid.
