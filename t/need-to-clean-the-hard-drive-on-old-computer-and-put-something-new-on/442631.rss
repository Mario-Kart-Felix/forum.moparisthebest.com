    <title>Need to clean the hard drive on old computer and put something new on</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-to-clean-the-hard-drive-on-old-computer-and-put-something-new-on/442631</link>
    <description>I have a desktop that is pretty old and runs decently slow from just getting a lot of use over time. I want to start using it again to run some stuff and save me some money so I don&#39;t have to buy a new desktop.

I need some information about how I do this. Google was no help.

I was wondering if there is a way I could torrent windows 7 and then put it on a flash drive and load it up onto the desktop and just clean the hard drive and install the new software and make the computer run fresh like it was brand new.

Also, the computer was windows XP so probably getting a new copy of that would work better than windows 7. I&#39;m not sure if putting newer software would mess it up.</description>

              <p>Marcbob you should just leave your operating system as windows xp if possible because you have already stated that the computer is slow. And if you upgraded to Windows 7 it’s just gonna make it even slower because more features from windows 7 and ram space taken up, etc… to run that version of windows. Also, if your gonna reformat it back to windows xp you would need the installation disk or at start up you could try holding down F8 and go through the recovery options to reset everything to factory settings. In addition, if you torrent its not even worth doing unless there is a product key that came with it for that version of windows 7, that would activate it.</p>

<p>2&gt; I have Win7 on an old dell laptop and it responds better than its previous WinXP installation. The worst possible thing that could happen is you need to download drivers.</p>
