    <description>Are you still stuck on how to get your client running and yet you keep getting errors for windows 7? Well you came to the right place! Im going to show you how to easily get your client running in no time with just a few simple codes!

[b][u]Step 1:[/u][/b] If you don&#39;t have the newest jdk and jre please go download them right away because its very, very, very important! Right now as of today you&#39;ll be needing jdk7 update 1 and jre7. If a newer version comes out i will re-edit the post so you don&#39;t need to be wondering what update you need.

[b][u]Step 2:[/u][/b] Go to start menu and right click computer and go to &#39;Properties&#39;! Once there go to &#39;Advanced System Settings&#39;. You&#39;ll see a little box popped up. Look for &#39;Environmental Variables&#39; and click it. Now you should see a smaller box appear. In that box at the very top click &#39;New&#39;. For the &#39;Variable Name&#39; type in: [code]CLASSPATH[/code] 

For the &#39;Variable Value type in: [code]C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin;%CLASSPATH%[/code] 

Now make another &#39;New&#39; one and this time for the &#39;Variable Name&#39; type in: [code]PATH[/code] 

For the Variable Value type in: [code]C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin[/code] 

Now you are done with that box! Now go to the bottom box create a new one there, and put the &#39;Variable Name&#39; as: [code]CLASSPATH[/code] 

For the &#39;Variable Value&#39; put in: [code]C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin[/code]  

Ok 1 more time... Make a new one and put the &#39;Variable Name&#39; as: [code]Path[/code]  

Now for the &#39;Variable Value&#39; put in: [code]C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin[/code] 

[center]That is it you are done with this step! To make sure you got it correctly I added a picure below of what it should look like when you are done![/center]

[b][u]Step3:[/u][/b] Now go to your run.bat and click edit. Clear the whole thing and add this to it: [code]@echo off
title Your Client
cd ./Class/
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\java.exe&quot; -cp bin; -Xmx500m Gui 30 0 lowmem members 32
pause [/code] 

Save it! Now run it and it should work!
