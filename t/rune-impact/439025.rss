Welcome the official Rune-Impact development thread.

Considering someone else took the name RuneXero I decided to create a new server with a new name, meaning a [b]completely[/b] new start. I realized that only a handle full of people like the old-school PI servers so I saw no point in continuing development on my old base as I would just be wasting my time. I never really liked 600+ graphics, animation, gfx whatever but I thought I would be able to do a good job on making it realistic (nothing half-assed). That&#39;s where Rune-Impact comes in; I plan on keeping it around 2009-2010&#39;ish with the exceptions of the graphics. [/center]
