    <title>**point based**?, F2p land only and Wilderness, Would you play?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/point-based-f2p-land-only-and-wilderness-would-you-play/552274</link>
    <description>Im sure that Iam going to put a server online for the community to play.

point based?
Free to play wilderness and land.
99 max stat.
still will have p2p skilling.

Would you play? these are already set in stone foundation for the server, and would liek to grow from this foundation.

im sick of all the slow grinding and gay rules other servers have.  At this rate i believe it will be slow enough to keep a stable pk scene, yet still fast enough to enjoy rewards.

Coming soon!</description>

So walden you’re paying xEnt to code a server for you, do you ever think anyone wants to play a server with you as the owner, Walden?<br>

<p>Oh i believe in a point’s based server. I was the first one to create it after stork took his offline. But asking for collabs from people especially xEnt just isn’t a realistic idea. I would be down for a points based server with exceptions and the right server base. Just all needs to be done right.</p>

the problem is, point based servers are instantly known for massive EXP rate servers with skills not even really being important (stork pk clones). how about a regular type of server, 4-6x but point based. still takes awhile to train, still requires people to skill, just gives that flexibility of changing your combat stats around.<br>

<p>Beyondrsc was great pk server, but from what i remember the source had some bugs on it…</p>
<p>point based server, with f2p/p2p switches, godmage nerfed as hell, so it dont hit ridiculous amounts like 25 etc… max hits 16’ish and so on… and add something NEW… not just a blank stork replica, we seen 50 of them, and not a beyondrsc/kingpk replica which is always the same… and one of the most important things these days, advertise it well. not many rsc players ( that there’s left) check’s mopar.</p>

New armour new weapons. Keep it 99s and x10 combat x3 skills. All skills have batch like wow not just 1 extra after 10 lvls… Fuck that.</p>

              <p>right… you do have some valid points here.  But my main focus is to keep the pking as basic and original like real RSC, because that is what I feel like was most fun.  When you get custom items that is when it takes away from the RSC feel and ruins pking.</p>
<p>As far as adding more stuff to the game… that could be a place to venture down, but i dont think new wearable items should be made because it ruins the game Runescape.</p>
