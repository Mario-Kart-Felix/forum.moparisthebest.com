    <title>Some questions about SCAR</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-questions-about-scar/60473</link>
    <description>Hello,

My first question is if im setting this up right? When I auto it usually doesnt catch/finnish the abyssal &quot;RE&quot;. Is there anything else I need to know about this form below? (BTW, what is the Nick part for? Randoms?)

This is Wizzup&#39;s Essence miner BTW.

    [code] Players[0].Name :=&#39;legit_name&#39;;
     Players[0].Pass :=&#39;password&#39;;
     Players[0].Nick :=&#39;legit_name&#39;;
     Players[0].Loc :=&#39;Bank&#39;;
     Players[0].Active:=True;
     Players[0].Boolean1  := True;   // Is The Pick Equipped?
     Players[0].Boolean2 := False; // False for brightness Check Once.
     Players[0].String1 := &#39;&#39;;   // Bank PIN, If any.[/code]

Second question, when I auto, should I used the unsigned Java Applet? Or should I be using the signed one. Or does it make a difference?

Question three, if I only have one character that I want to bot, couldn&#39;t I just fill in all player &quot;settings&quot; like the one above with the same names/login&#39;s?

**Question four, is SCAR like Aryan where &quot;Eventually&quot; your going to get banned? I plan on autoing a character to about level ~40 combat then making it my main. (Like even if you bot maybe, ONCE you will eventually get banned, like how aryan send a bad uid or somthing)
[size=7pt]**I do play on my character legit about 60% of the time. I&#39;ve already done most of the free quests and raised some mining/woodcutting/crafting/smithing legit to about level 10.[/size]

Question #5 - Are there any kind of scripts I should stay away from? (possibly the name/type of script, SRL - non-SRL?)

Finally, can someone suggest me a good auto-fighter? I dont mean supply me with a download, just the name of the autofiger. I have tried WT-Fakawi&#39;s gobblin scheduler, but it did not work to well.


Any advice/information would be great.
Thanks~</description>

Hello,</p>
<p>My first question is if im setting this up right? When I auto it usually doesnt catch/finnish the abyssal “RE”. Is there anything else I need to know about this form below? (BTW, what is the Nick part for? Randoms?)</p>

<p>1- really put ur username pass, nick is 3 letters from ur user name. true for pick equiped or flase if it isnt.</p>
<p>Second question, when I auto, should I used the unsigned Java Applet? Or should I be using the signed one. Or does it make a difference?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>the sighned one will make you lag lots less.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question three, if I only have one character that I want to bot, couldn’t I just fill in all player “settings” like the one above with the same names/login’s?</p>
<p>if you ahve 1 player, will in one player on how many players. then detlete the rest of the arrrays for played 1,2,3, etc.</p>
<p>**Question four, is SCAR like Aryan where “Eventually” your going to get banned? I plan on autoing a character to about level ~40 combat then making it my main. (Like even if you bot maybe, ONCE you will eventually get banned, like how aryan send a bad uid or somthing)<br>

<p>depending what scripts, scar is a hellavua lot less un dectble.</p>
<p>Question <span class="hashtag">#5</span> - Are there any kind of scripts I should stay away from? (possibly the name/type of script, SRL - non-SRL?)</p>
<p>stay away from ALL non srl scripts.</p>
<p>Finally, can someone suggest me a good auto-fighter? I dont mean supply me with a download, just the name of the autofiger. I have tried WT-Fakawi’s gobblin scheduler, but it did not work to well.</p>
<p>check srl free scripts at <a href="http://villu-reborn.com" rel="nofollow noopener">villu-reborn.com</a></p>
<p>Any advice/information would be great.<br>
Thanks~</p>

<p>No offence but the questions were answered.<br>
And you could just put<br>
1-blah blah blah</p>
<p>because all of what you said is in the quote.</p>

<p>The advice really helps me understand more about SCAR and how to auto safely. Ill go delete that file you told me to delete right away. Again, thanks very very much.</p>

<p>EDIT: BTW I found that file at (C:\WINDOWS.file_store_32\uid.dat) Hope it was the right one :o</p>

              <p>Ok, if you use the signed applet, delete the file “C:\Windows.jagex_cache_32\uid.dat” before autoing.</p>
<p>Question four: you will only get banned if you (ab)use 1 script too long. Try to use multiple scripts and make it so it looks like you play 4-6 hours a day. Say, for day 1 do woodcutting, next maybe fishing or mining. Of course there’s always a chance you’ll get banned, but look at WT-Fakawi’s army. He’s got addy miners.</p>
<p>Question five: keep away from any that don’t use SRL. If you NEED to, watch them for awhile and then after that, keep an eye on them. They might fuck up on random handlers and need assistance.</p>

              <p>1-Yes but your suppose to leave Loc blank and nick is your NickName 4 or 3 letters of your RS username.</p>
<p>2-it does matter if you use unsigned java applet,if you dont youll probably get banned on your main.</p>
<p>3-You could but it will login with the same character so i think you need to delete the rest and have just 1 for 1 character.</p>
<p>4-No scar is not Aryan, Aryan is when you walk in same places same walk boxes and all that stuff, Scar is where you script out your code thing and sometimes test it (which i dont) and maybe sell it or release it for the leachers and other people in this URL.</p>
<p>5-YES!KEYLOGGERS! some java scripts have that so you can scam and hack people or maybe SCAR scripts,i saw people with keyloggers in the java forum.</p>
<p>6-There was a chicken killer At <a href="http://www.villu-reborn.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.villu-reborn.com</a> but i forgot who made it.<br>
It was either tarajunky or dankness.</p>
<p>If you need Anymore questions post or PM me.</p>
