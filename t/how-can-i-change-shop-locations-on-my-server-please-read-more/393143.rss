              <p>This isn’t a spoon-feeding community but since you’re new i’ll help.</p>
<p>In Autospawn.cfg, find the NPC id of the NPC you wish to move.</p>
<p>Then go to the new spot and get those coordinates, you then want to change the first 2 coordinates of the NPC save and run the server, no need to compile for CFG files.</p>
