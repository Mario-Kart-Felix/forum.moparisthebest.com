    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-dont-be-angry-at-how-silly-this-question-may-seem/379802</link>
    <description>I am working on an older game called Lost Legends, a freeware action/RPG originally made by a group called Ghost Wood Games (www.ghostwoodgames.com); Their last released version was 0.2, or the 0.204 Beta version; Can anyone please tell me any of the following information:
1) What language is this game written in?
2) Has anyone heard of Ghost Wood Games or Grendel (the only person mentioned on the website)? I have tried every email address contact at the website and either receive a non-delivery email error or no response at all
3) Does anyone have any knowledge of this games&#39; program engine? I just have a couple of questions regarding particulars that I would like to try and change in my copy of the game...

Any information you could provide would be of great assisstance...

<p>Interesting find, I did some googling for lost legends sourcecode and turned up nothing, However after searching Grendel I did come up with this forum post <a href="http://omnimaga.org/index.php?topic=87.0" rel="nofollow noopener">http://omnimaga.org/index.php?topic=87.0</a> apparently an agrument took place between the developers and the project closed. <a href="http://lostlegends.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Source/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://lostlegends.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Source/</a></p>

<p>Pretty sure that that isn’t the game he is looking for, If i recall that game runs nice on Ti84 calculators. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
