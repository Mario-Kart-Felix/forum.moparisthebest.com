<p>You have pointed out the revision, but not the base. Please post which base you are using to be more accurate.</p>
<p>What you are asking for is in one big bunch.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make an NPC</li>
<li>Talk to the NPC</li>
<li>Not be able to AFK for tokkul</li>
<li>How to add Tokkul to the inventory/bank</li>
<li>If inventory is full, put in bank or vice-versa</li>
<li>How to make a shop</li>
<li>How to open that shop</li>
<li>How to claim tokkul from that shop for free</li>
</ol>
<p>The best way to solve this problem is to break it up into pieces. Solve the small problems one by one and you will have this done in no time!</p>
