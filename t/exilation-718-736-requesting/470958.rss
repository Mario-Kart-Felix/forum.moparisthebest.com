<p>Agreed… 50% should go to the server, the other 50% should be split between the everyone, including the owner… The owner has equal rights, as well as the coder and co-owner… Everyone would have to make at least some type of money, just to make it fair… Not on that… Yeah… I agree with KempiScape… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
