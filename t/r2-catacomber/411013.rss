[B][U]Description:[/U][/B]
Catacomber is our first and only Catacomb-running combat script. It&#39;s designed for swift combat and lasting endurance.  The catacombs are a great place to train with only a simple F2P quest to access them.  This script will handle all 10 rooms and you choose which one to raid!

[B][U]About the Catacombs:[/U][/B]
The Catacombs are a dungeon located in the Lumbridge Graveyard.  To unlock this area all you need is completion of [URL=http://&quot;http://www.tip.it/runescape/index.php?rs2quest_id=216&quot;]The Blood Pact quest[/URL].  (Note that this quest gives 100 exp to attack/defence/strength/ranged/magic)  The Catacombs is swarmed with 10 combat rooms and 1 boss room, this script will run all 10 combat rooms, each individually handled.  Enemies range from level 1 to level 15 combat, so it&#39;s a good place for low-to-mid level players to train endlessly.

&#39;FightRegion&#39; (line 25) is your input on which room to fight in.  Here&#39;s a picture of the different rooms:

[B][U]Features:[/U][/B]
*Fights endlessly in 1 of 10 rooms in the Lumbridge Catacombs

*No food required
*Complete &quot;Death Screen&quot; handling
*Re-equips your items upon dieing

*Out-of-ammo recognition
*[B]Very[/B] swift combat
*Solid break system (By Echo_) with cool graphics!
*World switching option (Switch worlds after every break)
*SRL Stats
*On-Screen progress report
*Failsafes to ensure endurance 

[B][U]AntiBans:[/U][/B]
*Human&#39;ish waiting periods
*Realistic combat
*Camera rotating

[B][U]How to use:[/U][/B] 
*The Blood Pact quest completed
*Start your player in front of Lumbridge castle or anywhere in the Catacombs

[B][U]Credits:[/U][/B] 
*Awkwardsaw for the idea
*Iamadam for a portion of the fighting procedure

[End Note]:

I&#39;m really excited about releasing this script.  This was my first ever combat script and I&#39;m very pleased with the end results!  Now, I&#39;ve only solo-tested this by myself so there might be a couple bugs I&#39;ll have to sort out, so please, by all means, post &#39;em here!  Bob&#39;s Ratinator was a very popular script, even with the low amounts of exp it brought and crowded areas it had to run it, so I&#39;m hoping that this can be a very wise alternative for that script.  Enjoy the script, and post your progress reports here! :)

You can find the script on Villavu by following the original post at the top of this thread.
