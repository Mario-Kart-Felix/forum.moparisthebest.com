    <description>Well I&#39;ve got a very basic circuit. Basically, it starts at the battery, from there it goes to a simple switch, which will control the motor, and from the motor it goes back to the battery.

Quick schematic I drew up[/center]

What I&#39;m trying to do, is have it go from the battery, split down one path to switch which will control some LEDs, and down the other path which has a separate switch which controls the motor. Of course the paths will need the same resistance otherwise one side will be favored more, but I&#39;ll cross that bridge when I come to it.

What I want (IIRC)[/center]

It&#39;s been almost a year since I&#39;ve dealt with circuits, and I&#39;ve got a few components, but I&#39;m sure I have everything. I&#39;ve got the extra switch, so that isn&#39;t a problem.

The LEDs I want are from a flashlight, and I&#39;m trying to do it without breaking the whole thing apart, since it seems like a pain, but what I don&#39;t understand about it is: The current flows from the batteries, into the light, but what completes it from there?

What else am I missing?</description>

              <p>the resistance of the components doesn’t really matter, unless they are vastly different.</p>
<p>that second circuit wont illuminate the LED though, because the current will favour the low resistance wire which effectively short circuits the component.</p>
<p>if you remove that wire, then you have a series circuit which isn’t what you want (both switches need to be on, and less current is drawn from the cell).</p>
<p>you need to add the components in parallel which allows you to switch each component on and off, and decreases the overall resistance so you can draw more current from the cell as you switch extra components on.</p>
<p>(the parallel circuit is what bootnecklad did)</p>
