    <title>Skills giving no xp, but they did [317] Delta</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/skills-giving-no-xp-but-they-did-317-delta/390092</link>
    <description>Hello, currently 2 skills are giving no xp in which I know they originally did. I&#39;m not sure when this happend or how, but randomly I noticed &quot;Mage&quot; gave no experience, and I have no idea how to fix it, currently my players cannot raise their magic levels, and slayer tasks no longer give xp. I have spent a long time in the client.java scimming over everything, but I just don&#39;t know what to look for and this is a very large issue for me right now, maybe sombody could help? 

EDIT: I&#39;m stupid, xp lock..............</description>
