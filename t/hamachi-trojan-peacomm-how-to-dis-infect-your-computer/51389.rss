    <title>Hamachi: Trojan.Peacomm (How To Dis-Infect Your Computer)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hamachi-trojan-peacomm-how-to-dis-infect-your-computer/51389</link>
    <description>About a day after downloading Hamachi, my anti-virus warned me that I had a rapidly spreading threat called &quot;Trojan.Peocomm&quot;. I read up on this virus, and, it apparently enters through spammed E-Mail. Normally, the simplest of firewalls would stop it from infecting your computer, but since Hamachi alows anyone who wants direct acess to your computer bypassing all firewalls, the Trojan.Peocomm virus infected my computer in under a minute. I have succesfully removed this virus, and can be done so by doing this:

1. IMMEDIATELY delete your Hamachi and Source you were using to run your server.
2. go into your recycling bin and delete them again, completely removing them from your system.
3. Go to http://www.symantecstore.com/dr/sat1/ec_Main.Entry17C?SID=49997&amp;SP=10023&amp;CID=0&amp;PID=843287&amp;PN=61&amp;V1=843287&amp;V2=&amp;V3=&amp;V4=&amp;V5=31040594&amp;CUR=840&amp;DSP=&amp;PGRP=0&amp;ABCODE=&amp;CACHE_ID=16137500001613780000197681 and select &quot;Try Now&quot; to recieve a free download.
4. Install it and download all available updates it offers you.
5. Close all browsers and run a full system scan
6. Restart your computer
7. Disable Your Internet, however you do it for your computer (for me i have a WLAN button on my laptop)
8. Run another full system scam
9. Restart your computer
10. Congratulations, you&#39;ve just gotten rid of your Trojan.Peocomm virus

IMPORTANT: do not download hamachi again as it will infect your computer AGAIN upon download, learn from my mistakes
NOTE: i only did this because people complain about hamachi giving them a virus and this is the most common one...[br][size=1]Posted on: January 22, 2007, 03:03:07 PM[/size][hr].</description>
