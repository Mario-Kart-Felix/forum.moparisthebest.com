    <title>Anonymous Classes, packaging, executables</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anonymous-classes-packaging-executables/203953</link>
    <description>I was just reading about anonymous classes and searching up some about it after seeing classname$# being created after compiling my program.

So I have the basic understanding of what it is and that it is required for using the program, but I was curious if lets say I was going to make my program into an executable jar file, would I have to include all the anonymous classes or just my main class? would this change my manifest or would i just put in my main class?

Also does anyone know how to make an .exe for your java program? My teacher said you can include all the packages and put your program as an exe so anyone can use your program without having jdk (or java i forget) and stuff installed on the user&#39;s computer. &lt;-- couldn&#39;t find anything useful in google.</description>
