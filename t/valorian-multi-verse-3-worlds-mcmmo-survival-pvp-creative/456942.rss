[u]A little bit about Valorian - [/u]
Valorian is a 3 world server in which players get the chance to play how they like; a lot of players like to PvP and grief so instead of just letting them reek havoc on the Survival world we created a world purely for Pvp, griefing, raiding and factions. Also many players just like to get straight to the building without having to explore or gather materials, so for players like this Valorian Creative is ideal as they can fly and spawn items and build as they wish. Besides the reasons stated above, we created these worlds so we could build a community with Valorian for example, players can join factions in PvP meaning they can work as teams and on creative players can build big projects together and bring them closer that way. To us this is important as we&#39;d like our players to feel comfortable and enjoy their time playing. 

[u]A few of our Rules -[/u]
As we use McBans not only do we follow by their banning guidelines we also have rules of our own -
- No Advertising on the server
- No Excessive Caps, Swearing or Spam
- No griefing (Also a McBans rule)(Griefing is allowed on the PvP world)
- No Homophobia, Sexism or Racism (Also McBans rules)
