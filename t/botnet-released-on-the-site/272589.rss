    <title>Botnet released on the site</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/botnet-released-on-the-site/272589</link>
    <description>Last night a botnet was released in the download section.  The thread title was &quot;A client.&quot; and this is what it contained.

[quote=&quot;*&quot;]Just a simple refactored client, slightly modified well here you go.

Just run it to try it out, if you have any questions ask me.[/quote]

If you happened to download the &quot;client&quot; please check your startup folder for a file called &quot;java.jar&quot; or something like that.  If your startup folder does contain that file, please delete it immediately.  If you have any questions please feel free to pm me or another member of the staff.</description>
