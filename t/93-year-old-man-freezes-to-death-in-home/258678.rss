    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;BAY CITY, Mich. (Jan. 26) - A 93-year-old man froze to death inside his home just days after the municipal power company restricted his use of electricity because of unpaid bills, officials said.
Marvin E. Schur died &quot;a slow, painful death,&quot; said Kanu Virani, Oakland County&#39;s deputy chief medical examiner, who performed the autopsy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think it was stupid to restrict his electricity. Its -40 temperatures here in Wisconsin and even worse in Michigan..and this guy is 93 years old.</description>
