    <title>Need client help asap</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-client-help-asap/228321</link>
    <description>ive downloaded over 10 clients none  of which seemed to work so then i thought hmm mabye its not the client maybe its me. whenever i hit run on the client it says Java is not recognized as an internal or external command, or batch file.


my friend told me that i needed to set my classpath with java jdk but he wont tell me how.


so if someone can post a link so i can get java jdk and can tell me how to set my class path that would be great


thanks =]</description>
