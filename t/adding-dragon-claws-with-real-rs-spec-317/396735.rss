    <title>Adding dragon claws with real rs spec! (317)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-dragon-claws-with-real-rs-spec-317/396735</link>
    <description>Hello, I am using Cammypvp source and I have dragon claws already, I just need to make them have the right emote. I have no idea what the emote code is, or where I would find it. Or can someone show me where to find the correct rs emote for them?
Thanks.
