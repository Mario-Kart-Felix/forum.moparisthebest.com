              <p>We don’t allow buying or selling of services through moparscape. Feel free to advertise that you are looking for a programmer and once you have their email/skype/whatever you can discuss payments there. We don’t allow our site to be used as a direct avenue for trades.</p>
<p>I edited your post accordingly. You can change it but don’t advertise that you are paying.</p>

              <pre><code>Name: I don't feel like saying that in public
Age: 20
Links to other work: We can discuss this in private
How long have you been working with Java: A few years really active
Skype: zeropointxx
How Many hours can you be on: about 6 hours a day
Why we should consider you: First of all I am very mature. I am also studying game engine programming in school so I know quite a lot about game development and more every month! I have been coding with c++ for about 1 year now as well. I am really independent and I can find/fix most problems by myself.
Timezone: GMT + 2
Have you worked on Runesource before: Can't remember, I have been working with so many sources that I doubt this can be all that different?</code></pre>
