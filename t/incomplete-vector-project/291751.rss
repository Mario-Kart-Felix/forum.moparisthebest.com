    <title>Incomplete Vector Project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/incomplete-vector-project/291751</link>
    <description>I was going to use this for a logo but GIMP kept crashing as soon as I would have it fully loaded, so I&#39;m just going to discontinue this project. I been working on it for 2 days, the background was hard to find but I still couldn&#39;t find one I wanted so I had to improvise with what I had for this project. Its weird how it was working right before I got photoshop CS3 (:D) though, I think GIMP is mad because it has competition now lol.

I got the render from Planet Renders website, its pretty cool. I used the path tool to color him blue. The background came off a flash background in DeviantArt (there&#39;s actually a flag behind him, but since he was so huge I had to cover it up). The original scene I wanted was him in a war with a bomb heading to kill him - got the idea thinking about my bro who&#39;s in the army (hes a marine).

It&#39;s just shown in progress to see how it&#39;s changed:

<p>PS that white loops looks more like you’re trying to show you can do something, rather than actually fitting your project.</p>
<p>That’s what I call effects driven work, which isn’t good.</p>

<p>The line was lighting from the original image.<br>
Oh, and it’s all really, really disgusting looking.</p>
<p>If it’s a vector project, you should probably use a program like Illustrator, not whatever you’re using right now.<br>
And it probably shouldn’t have a non-vector image on it.</p>
