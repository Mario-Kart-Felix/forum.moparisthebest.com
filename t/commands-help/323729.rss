    <description>Edit: ahh, memories...

hey guys, so im trying to add a ::spec command for mods to recharge spec. here&#39;s my code:

[code]if(command.startsWith(&quot;spec&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 1){
specialAmount += 100;
specAttack();
}[/code]

but when i compiled and ran the server, it didnt seem to work, and didnt recharge the spec. any ideas on how to fix this?

edit: i forgot to mention that this problem happens with ::hail and ::blowjob too.. it was at the owner&#39;s name so i set it to playerRights &gt; 1 so mods can use it but it wont work.

edit 2: i fixed it, i realised it was greater than, but not equal LOL. but now i have some other problems... i am trying to change some weapon stats like vls and stuff, but i dont know where the file is. i tried searching but it says &quot;you cannot enter this post because you don&#39;t have the permission to do so&quot; or something like that. help?</description>

<p>I always use <code>&gt;=</code> equal to or greater.</p>
<p>edit 2:<br>
It’s in item.cfg.</p>
<p>Its something named like that anyway.</p>
