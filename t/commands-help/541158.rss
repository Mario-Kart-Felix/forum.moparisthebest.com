<p>To be honest, assuming you have a task system that <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> run every 1000ms (1 second) you could just use that and each cycle in that event you’d just ++ to an int as it runs.

              <p>I personally use Java’s Calendar, however System.currentTimeMillis(); should work just fine for what you’re doing</p>
<p>So what you’re going to want to do, since they can only do the command every 2 hours, is when they type the command to check the current time, and get the players last time received (like the last time they claimed their reward) and make sure there is <span class="bbcode-u">at least</span> 2 hours worth of time in between.</p>
<p>Note: The following code was not tested on a server. However, with very minimal modification it should work perfectly.</p>
<p>[code=java]</p>
<p>public class TimeModificationTest<br>
{<br>
public static void main(String [] args)<br>
{<br>
/*<br>
* I stored System.currentTimeMillis(); in the long currentTime in case it happen to switch right over (it’s super rare, but possible)<br>
* as it goes through the three ints; seconds, minutes, hours.<br>
* From there I put all the ints (your time) into a string that is easier to read than just 3 numbers.<br>
* I also created the method addTime( int timeToAdd, String type ) so you can see what the System.currentTimeMillis(); would look like<br>
* with 2 hours added.<br>
<em>/<br>
long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();<br>
int seconds = (int) (currentTime / 1000) % 60 ;<br>
int minutes = (int) ((currentTime / (1000</em>60)) % 60);<br>
int hours   = (int) ((currentTime / (1000<em>60</em>60)) % 24);<br>
String formattedTime = "Hours: " + hours + " Minutes: " + minutes + " Seconds: " + seconds;<br>
System.out.println("Time: " + formattedTime);<br>
addTime(2, “hour”);<br>
}</p>
<pre><code>public static void addTime( int timeToAdd, String type)
{
	long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
	
	/* 
	 * If you didn't know, you can use a switch statement on strings.
	 * I added the other variables, second and minute, just in case you had some use for this method.
	 */
	switch( type ) {
	
		case "second":
			currentTime += (timeToAdd * 1000);
			break;
		
		case "minute":
			currentTime += (timeToAdd * 1000) * 60;
			break;
			
		case "hour":
			currentTime += ( (timeToAdd * 1000) * 60 ) * 60;
			break;
		default:
			System.out.println("Unknown time format.");
			break;
	}
	
	/* Reusing the code from above, because if it ain't broke, don't fix it. */
	int seconds = (int) (currentTime / 1000) % 60 ;
	int minutes = (int) ((currentTime / (1000*60)) % 60);
	int hours   = (int) ((currentTime / (1000*60*60)) % 24);
	String formattedTime = "Hours: " + hours + " Minutes: " + minutes + " Seconds: " + seconds;
	System.out.println("Time: " + formattedTime);
}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>The above code works perfectly (I believe).<br>
It’s just an example on how to modify and retrieve the time in a “readable” format instead of a long like:1349333576093<br>
So if I were you, I’d store the readable format, or you could just store it in the long form and access it that way.<br>
It’s up to you, what you do next. But if it were me this is what I’d do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a method to read the time, and have it return a string. Something like public String methodName(long timeToRead) would be perfect.</li>
<li>Create the variable you’d like to save. And make sure to save it.</li>
<li>Create your command, make it check the current time, and the time from last confirmation. Compare them, make sure its at least 2 hours away, and if so reward them and then make sure to update the players last check to the current time.</li>
</ol>
