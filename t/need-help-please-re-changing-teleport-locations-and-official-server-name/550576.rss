I wasn’t taking credit. I was saying “Good to hear it worked” as in “Good to hear it is how you wanted it” or “Good to see you found a solution"<br>
Not<br>
"Good to hear what I SAID worked” or any variation.</p>

<p>Good to hear it worked.<br>
I suggest using an IDE in the future to avoid compiler issues (Really, IDE’s are a godsend).<br>
The most commonly used ones (Afaik) are <a href="http://eclipse.org" rel="nofollow noopener">http://eclipse.org</a> and <a href="http://netbeans.org" rel="nofollow noopener">http://netbeans.org</a></p>
<p>They will be rather confusing at first glance if you’ve never used them, but once you get comfortable with the environment, you wont wanna write code any other way.</p>

Im merely asking how to change Home teleports delivery co-ordinates, nothing youve said is relevant to this.</p>
<p>Go away now, your just trying to get post count[/quote]<br>
I apologize for miss-reading what you were trying to do.</p>
<p>Have you looked in ClickingButtons.java for the ID 4171?<br>
You should have something <span class="bbcode-i">similar</span> to</p>
<p><code>case 4171:
c.getPA().spellTeleport(X_COORD, Y_COORD, Z_COORD, "modern");
break;</code></p>
<p>Again, similar.<br>
You will need to modify the x y and z.</p>
<p>Sometimes, or should I say most of the times, the coordinates will be in Config.java, but that’s not always the case.</p>
<p>If it’s different, or a part of editing that is confusing you, then post the code for the case 4171 and I’ll explain what you need to do.</p>

Talking about the teleports you’re so worried about changing.<br>
The button ID isn’t related to the text ID.</p>
