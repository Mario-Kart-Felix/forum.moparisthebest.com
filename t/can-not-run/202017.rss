    <title>Can not run?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-not-run/202017</link>
    <description>hey im completly new to the server making. well i was foloing a guide on how to make a server.and i skipped a couple steps cause i could not locate the thing that it asked you to do. well i have comcast(gay!)router and it was a little bit more complicated for prt forwarding. i did my best to folo the instructions, althoughthere was a slight diffrence. first of all..netgear.isnt working and i dont use linsys. so as it said i stuck my default gateway code in the adress bar and asked for username and pass. i already knew it i went in and went to prt configuration wich looked like this:[URL=http://img180.imageshack.us/my.php?image=1pwnage3jq7.jpg][IMG]http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/5025/1pwnage3jq7.th.jpg[/img][/URL]

i put in exactly what it wanted me to do as you see in the first line of word boxes.
and i added but, i have a source. testscape. i edited it somewhat so far, made me admin, changed server name and such. i compiiled it, but when i hit run the black box comes up and says: starting testscape server  on 0.0.0.0:43594
and nothing after that. yes i already made my no-ip acc and added the host. it is blazingranger.no-ip.biz i have tried multiple webclients but nothing. any idea?</description>
