              <p>I can  honestly see where your coming from but the way I am looking at it is like this.</p>
<p>-A good portion of those who use the server advertisement board are people who rarely post elsewhere. Due to this,  a person most honestly really and  truly will NOT read the global rules and etc.</p>
<p>-Due to the above reason about them only staying on that board they aren’t there for the community just for the advertisement so they really could care less if they said bump or not and got into trouble ( most of them )</p>
<p>-If a bump feature wasn’t added I would at least add exactly what you said as a topic labeled something like “information about bumping”</p>

              <p>Posting bump manually is frowned upon and I personally don’t like it when I see it a lot. A “bump” feature would be taking it a step too far. My rule of thumb is that if your topic isn’t attracting enough attention in the form of <span class="bbcode-b">proper</span> comments, it doesn’t deserve to be on the first page of topics.</p>
