    <title>Connection Refused with Demonik. Help please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-refused-with-demonik-help-please/359330</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got the ports forwarded, both 80 and the other, and yet I&#39;m still getting connection errors.

I&#39;ve changed the configuration file for the devine 5.0 client to point to my servers IP address. It still is giving me the same error.

Java.net.connectionexception: conection refused: connect.

If you want pictures to prove the fact that my ports are all forwarded, I&#39;ll be glad to oblige. Just please don&#39;t flame.

ANYWAY, any help would be appreciated. I would like to say I&#39;m using a Netgear router and it&#39;s sometimes iffy on forwarding, so if you think that&#39;s the problem, please don&#39;t be shy to inform me.

More info: I&#39;m running Windows Server 2003 with the 43595 ports and 80 ports all open through the fire wall, and on the router the same ports are open through the hardware firewall.

Edit: Could it be a problem with the Server.bat? I just ran it, caught a prtsc before it closed (that was fun), and found this error:

ANT_HOME is set incorrectly or ant could not be located. Please set ANT_HOME.

When configuring the bat file, do I just add set ANT_HOME=C:\Apacheant\bin? Or, do I replace ant demonikp2p? I read a tutorial about it that helped somewhat, but never gave very direct specifics...</description>

              <p>Well, I’ve come to two conclusions: Either A) I’m mentally retarded and I’m so incompatent that I can’t forward a port, or B) The client problem is router-end and the router, which I’ve known mine to do, is refusing to forward ports because it’s a terrible, idiotic machine. Which one do you think? Like I said, it clearly says in my router that I’ve got the port fowarded. It’s an older router, from around 2005.</p>

              <p>I’m trying that “easy” one, and it’s giving me even more problems. I decided to give up on the server server (for now), but now I’m getting this little error: Can not find “java.exe”. “Java.exe” is not a valid yada yada yada yada, bunch of mumbo jumbo that’s not entirely important because it gives no error code number. I set up the environmental variables for JSK (that’s what it’s called right? Not the runtime, but the other one lol), and yet I still get that error. I have it installed, 32-bit. My computer’s 64 bit but I don’t use a 64 bit browser so… Should I upgrade?</p>
<p>Edit: Apparently, idky, every time I try to “build” easyRSC, the build file ends up deleted (not the bat, the folder it creates). I’m running Windows 7, I have the permissions of the folder set to everyone can modify, it’s at my computers root, etc. etc. etc. and I’m running it in admin mode. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Edit 2: And I’m still getting a connection denied… I’ve also used sites to check to see if 46594/5 are open and both say they’re not even though on my router they’re said they are… <em>sigh</em> Apparently I’m not meant to have my own server…</p>
<p>Edit 3: Apparently the build is working, but the server isn’t, giving me the Java.exe isn’t a valid protocol or program (something of that sorts). Also, it’s when trying to run the client (just to see if I still get the error) that it says that access is denied to the port.</p>

What one that’s as close to RSC (without idioticly modded to hell files) you can get? Basically I want to be able to play RSC with just me and my friend. I’ve got a literal server set up to host it, I just need the sources etc. to host it with.</p>

              <p>I’ve got the ports forwarded, both 80 and the other, and yet I’m still getting connection errors.</p>
<p>I’ve changed the configuration file for the devine 5.0 client to point to my servers IP address. It still is giving me the same error.</p>
<p>Java.net.connectionexception: conection refused: connect.</p>
<p>If you want pictures to prove the fact that my ports are all forwarded, I’ll be glad to oblige. Just please don’t flame.</p>
<p>ANYWAY, any help would be appreciated. I would like to say I’m using a Netgear router and it’s sometimes iffy on forwarding, so if you think that’s the problem, please don’t be shy to inform me.</p>
<p>More info: I’m running Windows Server 2003 with the 43595 ports and 80 ports all open through the fire wall, and on the router the same ports are open through the hardware firewall.</p>
<p>Edit: Could it be a problem with the Server.bat? I just ran it, caught a prtsc before it closed (that was fun), and found this error:</p>
<p>ANT_HOME is set incorrectly or ant could not be located. Please set ANT_HOME.</p>
<p>When configuring the bat file, do I just add set ANT_HOME=C:\Apacheant\bin? Or, do I replace ant demonikp2p? I read a tutorial about it that helped somewhat, but never gave very direct specifics…</p>
