    <title>E-cigs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/e-cigs/550259</link>
    <description>I purchased a Vuse vapor pen a week or so ago, and it was awesome at first but eventually started to seem pretty pointless to use. I decided to get a pretty decent e-cig, along with a pretty nice flavor called &quot;Hobbes&#39; Blood&quot;. It has a very nice strawberry and watermelon flavor, with just a tiny bit of coconut.

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone else here has one. Also, what flavors do you like?</description>

Yes, it depends on how much you vape a day typically.<br>

I’ve gotten to where I usually can vape a full tank of liquid (MELO cartomizer) in no more than 2 days.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thats about where I’m at, ill vape til it gets a lil hot and when it cools down I’m vaping again. I’ve went from smoking a little over a pack a day to about half a pack a day if that</p>

<p>What do you meen by better, and if you think about how much you spend on a pack of cigarettes a day depending on how much you smoke and one bottle of juice is like 11.99 depending where you go and what you buy.

Sorry, I continue to forget that the prices of cigarettes are completely different by the state. For example, in Georgia, it ranges from $4-6 USD while in New York (and from what I heard of course) it ranges from $14-17 USD. I suppose where you live would making vaping more cost efficient.[/quote]</p>
<p>Damn cigarettes in NY are high but no here in Kentucky I smoke Marlboro Edge that range from 3.50 a pack to 4.20 a pack but I smoke a pack and a half a day so thats 10.5 packs a week which is a half a pack over a carton so im smoking 42$ a week thats about 170$ a month on cigarettes when i could probably spend 50$ a month on juice plus maybe a new coil which is 2.99. I think vaping is cheaper in the long run (Depending on where you live like you said)</p>

<p>I’m sure everyone has a reason for vaping. You can adjust the nicotine level you are taking in, as well as choose from a vast amount of flavors. In the end though, for those that put more money into this than the average person they are most likely just pursuing it as a hobby.</p>

              <p>If you aren’t looking to make a hobby of vaping it should only be pricey to get a decent mod to use with batteries, RDA, and or tank. Then it is just liquid from there and how much you vape. One reason some mods are so expensive is the computer chip in them is so much more accurate at reading your voltage,watts, and battery life than other cheaper ones are. If you are just trying to quit cigs it would definitely save money.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, the best E-Liquid (Or E-Juice, whatever fancies your taste) is SpaceJam. It’s a brand, but any Juice they have is amazing. I used to go to a store here where I live, and they let me test different drippers, mods, e-cigs, and they would let me take them home for a couple of days (or weeks depending on the price of the mod/cig) to test it out and see how long the coils/setup would last. They ALWAYS had me try out different SpaceJam liquids just to see which ones were the best (and to be honest, I could never find a favorite because every time I did, I’d find a new one with the next batch.)</p>

It has more than just one ‘dangerous’ chemical, not sure if your aware of what formaldehyde is but its a big cancer causing chemical, and for it to produce 15times more than regular cigs… Seems to me like your just killing yourself off, I know regular cigs kill you just as much but if Vaping is to why even stop smoking cigs? Sure as hell wont do both. Just saying I know several people and friends that have quit vaping because of this, do some more reseach you’ll find more stuff about the famous “E-cigs”<br>
[/quote]<br>
I know what formaldehyde is, I read about it before purchasing e-cigs. But I still think it’s better than the tar and chemicals of real cigarettes. I personally am not going to permanently be vaping, it’s just a way to get rid of the habit of smoking real cigarettes. In fact, I have noticed that I tend to vape less than I smoke, because when you smoke real cigarettes you need to smoke the whole thing or it will taste like shit next time you light it up.</p>

<p>Yes real cigarettes do the same I’m sure, but as I was saying we know the long-term effects of cigarettes nobody knows the long-term effects from vaping.</p>
<p>But on topic, after doing some more research and reading about all the thousands of poisons in cigarettes and the few in Vaping I decided to buy me a couple new coils for my cig and bought some liquid called Space Rockz (A sweet and fruity strawberry kiwi pop rocks candy) 18mg of nicotine and its really good. I still smoke cigarettes but I dont smoke as much when I Vape.</p>

              <p>The studies saying ecigs create formaldehyde are done in unrealistic situations. You would have to vape one cigarettes worth in one hit which is impossible. That is the main gist of a two page study I read at work as the question is asked a lot. Just like you can’t vape one cigs worth in one hit, you cannot smoke a cig in one hit as you would choke at the least. No worries.</p>

              <p>No of course nobody adds it. Formaldehyde can be a by product created in the vaping process due to the ingredients used to make the liquid which is often cheap shit ejuice. Use of different, more expensive ingredients that do not cause formaldehyde is what I mean by saying we do not have it in our juices without saying something I am not supposed to say. Same goes for another local company with e juice twice the price of ours cause they use ingredients that wont create the formaldehyde by product and I have no clue what is in theirs. Vaping no matter what is used or created as a by product from how much you vape and voltage used is going to be safe. It is best to not smoke or vape.</p>
