[FONT=Franklin Gothic Medium]Resolus is focused on giving each and every player a great experience when playing. Resolus strives for a strong community to have fun and partake in fun adventures to reach the top! There a many things to do in Resolus and more and more is coming each and every day! There will always be something new to do and Resolus plans to keep it that way. The server already includes great content to experience, such as:[/center]

[*]Bossing: Plenty of bosses to battle off with! Including Avatar of Destruction! Try getting your hands on one of the monsters rares! 
[*]Training: Tons of monsters to train off and gain wealth while getting XP!
[*]Minigames: Sick of training? Try out all 6 minigames including - Barrows, Fight Caves, Fight Pits, Duel Arena, Pest Control, and even Castle Wars! 
[*]PKing: Tons of locations to battle people off and find out who&#39;s the best player killer! Not interested in losing your items? Then check out FunPK!
[*]Economy: Our economy is great because items won&#39;t just be handed out or dropped instantly by bosses. We don&#39;t want every player to be done with the game within a week, so there are many challenges along the way of mastering Resolus! The XP is fast, but not too fast. The drop rates are fair and we hope the player will always have something to do.[/ul]


Resolus is very open to criticism and suggestions! If you have any please post on our website! [/FONT]

<p>[FONT=Franklin Gothic Medium]Resolus is focused on giving each and every player a great experience when playing. Resolus strives for a strong community to have fun and partake in fun adventures to reach the top! There a many things to do in Resolus and more and more is coming each and every day! There will always be something new to do and Resolus plans to keep it that way. The server already includes great content to experience, such as:[/center]</p>
<p>[<em>]Bossing: Plenty of bosses to battle off with! Including Avatar of Destruction! Try getting your hands on one of the monsters rares!<br>
[</em>]Training: Tons of monsters to train off and gain wealth while getting XP!<br>
[<em>]Minigames: Sick of training? Try out all 6 minigames including - Barrows, Fight Caves, Fight Pits, Duel Arena, Pest Control, and even Castle Wars!<br>
[</em>]PKing: Tons of locations to battle people off and find out who’s the best player killer! Not interested in losing your items? Then check out FunPK!<br>
[*]Economy: Our economy is great because items won’t just be handed out or dropped instantly by bosses. We don’t want every player to be done with the game within a week, so there are many challenges along the way of mastering Resolus! The XP is fast, but not too fast. The drop rates are fair and we hope the player will always have something to do.[/ul]</p>
<p>Resolus is very open to criticism and suggestions! If you have any please post on our website! [/FONT]<br>
