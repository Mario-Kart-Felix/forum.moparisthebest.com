    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/basic-having-connection-issues/312221</link>
    <description>Ok i posted eailer on how to connect to myself
no i have another issue at hand
i have port forwarded the correct port
i have a no-ip with the desired domain
i ask my friend to test if he can log on
and he cannot
is there somewhere in my source that i have to
add my no-ip that i want to use so they can connect?
because on my client
if i make the ip 127.0.0.1;
i connect just fine but if i used my no-ip domain
it dosen&#39;t work
possibly there is something wrong that some1 can tell me
thanks</description>
