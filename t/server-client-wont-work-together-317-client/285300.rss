    <title>Server + client won&#39;t work together (317 client)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-client-wont-work-together-317-client/285300</link>
    <description>I have a good server, and a client that is supposed to work together, but I go to change the ip for the server... and all that junk, and it doesn&#39;t work anymore :(.. I was hoping I could make it into my OWN server, and my OWN client and changing like a ton of stuff, but it won&#39;t work.. I can&#39;t find where I went wrong...

I&#39;ve done all the obvious places for your server ip.. I&#39;ll show you mine, well what I&#39;ve found obvious.. client-side.
[code]public final void init()
	{
		try
		{
			anInt957 = 0;
			anInt958 = 0;
			method52(true);
			aBoolean959 = true;
			signlink.storeid = 32;
			signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getLocalHost());
			setserver(&quot;crystalscape.sytes.net&quot;, &quot;43594&quot;);
			method2(503, false, 765);
		}[/code] is one, 

[code]public static final void main(String args[])
    {
        try
        {
            anInt957 = 0;
            anInt958 = 0;
            method52(false);//highmem
            aBoolean959 = true;//members
            signlink.storeid = 32;
            signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getLocalHost());
            client client1 = new client();
            client1.method1(503, false, 765);
			setserver(&quot;crystalscape.sytes.net&quot;, &quot;43594&quot;);
            return;
        }[/code] is another

[code]        anInt1171 = 1;
        aString1173 = &quot;&quot;;
        aString1174 = &quot;&quot;;
        server = &quot;crystalscape.sytes.net&quot;;
        aBoolean1176 = false;
        anInt1178 = -1;
        aClass19_1179 = new Class19(169);
        anInt1184 = 128;[/code] is the last one.

all I want to know is if there is like a directory thingy there.. that well, has it redirect over to the files in the server folder and stuff...</description>

              <p>There’s alot of possibilities on why it’s not running. One thing is that you didn’t portforward, no-ip Duc isn’t running if you portforwarded, and not using bit/utorrent, maybe it’s on the wrong server port, and alot more. Maybe you just left out another "setserver "</p>
