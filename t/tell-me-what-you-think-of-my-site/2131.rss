<p>Example:<br></p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">http://www.bigfish58.com/cgi-bin/anyboard.cgi?pvp=main/&amp;amp;cmd=retr&amp;vf=aW5kZXguaHRtbA%3D%3D</code></pre>

<p>Makes the same effect but it loads faster since it's easier to parse. But all those bug fixes I made on your front page made your page load about 10x faster lol. Before it was so laggy.</p>

<p>I suppose it's alright for friends and family though. But the majority of people do not like listening to music on websites(despite how tempted you may be to put it on). But its a nice clean site, and at least its not one of those piczo sites <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=3" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Good job.</p>
