    <title>508 Tokkulscape help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-tokkulscape-help/405077</link>
    <description>Okay, i&#39;m using clockwise27&#39;s tokkulscape (found here: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=391563.0) and i needed a little help with tweaking a few problems i&#39;ve seen. The PK is a good system, but when a death occures, a small handful of random items are dropped. I would like to change it so that everything except for the 3 items are dropped. Also, staff can&#39;t trade players, and i would like to fix that as well. Any help that can be given would be greatly appreciated, if possible, use as much detail as you can, i&#39;m fairly new to this.</description>
