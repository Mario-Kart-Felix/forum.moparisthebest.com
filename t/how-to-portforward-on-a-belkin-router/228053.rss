    <title>How to portforward on a belkin router</title>

    <description>Ok, so get your server port. Most of them will be 43594, so use that port if you dont know what port it is, ok so open your internet and type in the address bar your default gateway, this can be found by going to start &gt; run &gt; type cmd &gt; type ipconfig and check your default gateway like so.

Ok, so your logged into your router. If it asks for a username or password go ask your parents/gaurdians for the username and password. Ok, click virtual servers like so

If it asks for a password try leave it blank, then if it says login error go back and ask for the password. Right now your on virtual servers, type any description EG: your server name. Now in the inbound port type 43594 in both of them, on the type bit its TCP and on the pirvate port enter your IP address it can be found by going to start &gt; run &gt; type cmd &gt; type ipconfig and it will come up, type it in the virtual servers bit, and on the private port its 43594 in both of them, and tick the box. It should look like this.

Click save, and finished! Btw, if your IP address changes for some reason keep changing it in the portforwarded bit here, or your server wont work.

Hope this helped :)
