              <p>[quote=“casey., post:2, topic:541824”]Server related questions should be in the correct section. Try server help next time.</p>
<p>Anyhow, are you trying to play on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> or a downloaded source? To me it sounds like the first option, so I’m going to recommend checking out the Server status page. Find a server that interests you, click it, and find out more about it. You may need to download their game client to play though.</p>
<p>Secondly, I’d imagine no public server has commands enabled for pnpc. You could set up your own server to do that though.</p>
<p>Happy moparscapeing ![/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, I’m sorry! I will ask there next time.</p>
<p>and yeah, it was the first option. I wanted to play the moparscape 508 as there I could use PNPC.<br>
but it always comes  No response from server.</p>
<p>Ah, thanks. Yep, I wanted to make my own… but I can’t find a easy way to do it. :c  I’m no expert.</p>
