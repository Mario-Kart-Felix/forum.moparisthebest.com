<pre><code class="lang-auto">Step 1:
The first thing you have to do, is find out whether you have 'InWildy' (everything is safe apart from designated areas) or NonWildy (everything is dangerous apart from designated areas). Start, by opening you client.java and searching (by pressing Ctrl+F) and typing in 'public void checkwildy()'. Above that there will be either;

- Public Boolean InWildy
or
- Public Boolean NonWildy

If you have InWildy, your entire map is safe from player v player combat apart from the areas within the co-ordinates that come after 'public void checkwildy()'. If you have NonWildy, your entire map is player v player combat, and characters can be attacked anywhere but the areas within the co-ordinates that come after public boolean cheackwildy().

Step 2:


Code:
if ((absX &gt;= 5601 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 5651 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 2654 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 2704))

If you understand what it does already, then this will be a breeze for you. If you don't, it will still be easy if this tutorial is as good as I wanted to make it.



Code:
absX &gt;= 5601

This mean any co-ordinate greater than or equal to 5601 will be wildy/safe (depending on what you have). This diagram will help;



Basically, it says everthing to the right (greater than) of that co-ordinate is wildy. But that's no good if we just want a small area. So we add the second part;


Code:
absX &lt;= 5651
This time it says everything smaller than or equal to 5651 is wildy.



By now, you should be starting to get the idea. Let's do the other two, just so you're sure. We add the third part now. This time it's Y, not X, so we're changing the vertical axes;


Code:
absY &gt;= 2654 



The last on now. You're adding this now;


Code:
absY &lt;= 2704
Once you've done that, you'll get this;



Whatever is in the area that's left behind is the safe/wildy zone. Don't just use these co-ordinates. I dont know where htey are</code></pre>
