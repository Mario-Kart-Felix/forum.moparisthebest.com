    <title>Include calling a scriptside proc?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/include-calling-a-scriptside-proc/15390</link>
    <description>Is there a way for an include to call a proc/func that is in script?

(the script includes the include obviously)


EDIT: History helped me at srl. If anyones interested you put
[scar]procedure proc1; forward;[/scar]
In the include before calling proc1 (and proc1 is the name of the procedure in the script).</description>

              <p>I made a procedure that creates a grid of points in a box and checks to see when the color at the points changes (and tell you the coords of the point that changed). I want to add the ability to set exceptions, for example ignore changes that happen in certain are (like a fire), or ignore changes at points that have a certain uptext when you put the mouse over it.</p>
<p>FindColorChangeGrid(x1, y1, x2, y2, d, giveuptime, whichex: integer) will be in the include, and when a scripter wants to use it they put a number in for whichex. FindColorChangeGrid will call a function in the script that decides whether to ignore a change or not. This is in the script so that the scripter can set the exceptions without editing the include and making the user edit the include. The function in the script has a case of list of exceptions, so that the scripter can put several customs exceptions, and pick which one to use each time they call FindColorChangeGrid by putting the right number for whichex.</p>
<p>I don’t want to force the scripter to put the whole FindColorChangeGrid in the script and then edit the exceptions because it’s pretty big. As I said before, having the user edit the include or the scripter provide another version of the include for the user is not an option. This leaves me with 2 options that I can see, putting the exception function in the script and have the main proc in the include call it, or breaking up the main proc and use unique global variables to keep it togther and put the smallest part possible that will contain the exceptions in the script. The latter will mean more hassle for the scripter and means putting more code in the script, which goes against the whole point of procedures in includes (although it won’t be as bad as putting the whole thing in the script).</p>
