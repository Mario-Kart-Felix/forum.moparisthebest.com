    <title>Discussion and views on Obama</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/discussion-and-views-on-obama/305641</link>
    <description>Other OP was a retard, most of his thoughts were wrong and ignorant. This basically continues the discussion on his thread. Not to mention it was most likely going to be derailed because of what sanga said :P

[hr]

Comment in general:
Obama&#39;s Advisor Valerie Jarrett was recently accused of pocketing government subsidies for housing (http://www.judicialwatch.org/news/2008/nov/obama-advisor-valerie-jarrett-linked-real-estate-scandals). Chances are she will be forced to resign seeing as how Glenn has forced about 3 or 4(Van Jones and Yosi Sergant are all i can think of atm)  people already to be forced to resign by Barack Obama himself(If GB was wrong, they wouldn&#39;t have been fired now would they?), and Valerie is next. They were all forced to resigned by scandals they&#39;ve committed. My main question is why would Obama hire these types of people, and why would they do such a thing? He knows how badly he&#39;s being watched and its not doing him any good with people like this in office =\

Also for those of you who live in the US, Obama recently made a speech about having year around school.. Which im iffy about because it would mean we have more breaks but it would also be alot more annoying. What do you think about that? IYO

I also find it funny that we.. lit up? the empire state building to celebrate China&#39;s 60 years of communism..? Odd :P

[b]Also, im not drawing all the attention onto me even though it may seem like it. Im just continuing the other thread, view it as if someone else posted it.[/b]</description>

<p>I’ve also never said hes done nothing, its other people that say he hasn’t done anything so he couldn’t have screwed up yet.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I also find it funny that Obama, Michelle, and Oprah all spent loads of money to fly to the Olympic meetings or whatever to try to get the Olympics in Chicago, and when they got voted out in the first round they all blamed Bush, saying he ‘ruined the country so bad that they wont even hold the olympics here.’ Hard to believe people could be so ignorant, i mean really. We have held the olympics numerous times and so have other popular places. They chose South America because it has never had them. So how is that Bush’s fault?</p>

              <blockquote>NEW YORK – President Barack Obama's approval ratings are starting to rise after declining ever since his inauguration, new poll figures show as the country's mood begins to brighten. But concerns about the economy, health care and war persist, and support for the war in Afghanistan is falling.
<p>An Associated Press-GfK poll says 56 percent of those surveyed in the past week approve of Obama’s job performance, up from 50 percent in September. It’s the first time since he took office in January that his rating has gone up.</p>

<p>Regardless of Obama’s competency, you’ll have to agree the world has hated America less since the day he was elected.</p>

<p>This almost made me piss myself. He not only is most likely going to break his promise and send thousands of more troops into afghanistan, he also tripled the US deficit. Were in such a bad place thanks to his “generous” loans to the fat cats, that we won’t be coming out of it for a long long time. Thank God I’m moving to Canada, where they also didn’t half ass their health care plan.<br>
Because other countries don’t know exactly what hes doing.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>What the fuck are you talking about? The only person ill-informed here, is you. Stop with the bullshit. Since his inauguration, has he really done anything to disrupt the daily lives of Americans? There haven’t been any cataclysmic Earth shattering events since he became President.</p>
<p>In fact his lack of action is the main reason why Americans are becoming irritated. The retarded masses of America think that because they didn’t get a check for $100,000 from the Gov’t, that something is fucked up. He doesn’t kill babies and drink their brains, he’s not the next Stalin either. If anything he’s trying to help improve the living condition of Americans.</p>
<p>You’re initial post sounds like a garbled up news broadcast from Hannity’s television show. All that shit is Propaganda. Most, if not all, of their so called ‘information’ is rarely backed up by fact. And when there is any ‘fact’ it’s usually misconstrued to make Obama look like the Antichrist.</p>
<p>You might think from my viewpoint that I’m a liberal, and I want to take your guns. And that’s not the truth at all. I live in Kentucky, own many guns, and am an educated person who doesn’t listen to my mommy and daddy talk about politics. My father is very right winged, so is my mother. But all they watch is fox news, they call all the other news stations biased. Which is comical because it’s just the opposite.[/quote]</p>

<p>Also for those of you who live in the US, Obama recently made a speech about having year around school… Which im iffy about because it would mean we have more breaks but it would also be alot more annoying.</p>
