After reading that... i decided to try it... whatever you do, don&#39;t try to take a tablespoon at once with a gulp of water.. You will puke before you swallow it.


I had a little left and i mixed it with yogurt... probably am not gonna get effect... but then again im 100 pounds... and havent eaten much lately.</description>

<p>Thanks, but you misunderstood. I don’t use drugs though :P. But I’ll read it over, because I’m bound to end up doing drugs one way or another. Good to know some information about the drugs before using it, as a precautionary.</p>
<p>EDIT: Haha, they classified tea there. Since it is a stimulant. I drink black tea all the time :). Gives you tons of energy.</p>

<p>After reading that… i decided to try it… whatever you do, don’t try to take a tablespoon at once with a gulp of water… You will puke before you swallow it.</p>
<p>I had a little left and i mixed it with yogurt… probably am not gonna get effect… but then again im 100 pounds… and havent eaten much lately.</p>
