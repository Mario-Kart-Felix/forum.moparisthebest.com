    <description>Was looking for a good server for my first real server to have up and running..so I went through like every server in the download section and only found 1 I liked and it was ricscape v5..

so I downloaded it and ran it and a lot of ppl liked it, but only 1 prob..no silab items or jagex items..w/e yall wanna call it.

and many ppl keep asking me to add these new codes to the server..well as a first time server user..so if any good coders would like to help out and add the new silab items to the servers ::pickup list, shop&#39;s and monster drop..it be appreciated a lot by everyone playing on the server.

+ u get a easy admin spot on my server and any name u want..and server will most likely be up 24/7</description>
