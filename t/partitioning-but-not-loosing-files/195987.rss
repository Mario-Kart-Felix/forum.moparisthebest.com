    <title>Partitioning but not loosing files</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/partitioning-but-not-loosing-files/195987</link>
    <description>well I just freed up more space from my windows partition so I can have a big enough swap to accommodate my ram when going into hibernation.
and I put my swap at beginning of this unallocated space, but I want to use the rest of this space(17 Gigs) for my linux partition. However, It only allows me to add on to the end, and not the the beginning. I do not want to loose all my files and have to reinstall EVERYTHING again, as the PSP toolchain can be annoying to set up. however it will not let me combine them...
I would like to ultimately switch over to linux, however I can&#39;t get linux TV to work with my Tuner card, and sometimes I would like to record things when I am not at home.
but anyway, is there a way to just Shift over everything and expand?</description>

              <p>That is what I used.<br>
the only way I can see is by using a backup utility and save on disks or a remote folder, and dumping it back onto a bigger partition.<br>
and an extended partition did not help at all…<br>
what folders should I back up(I’ve already done usr, and etc, I am about to backup the home folder)<br>
and is there a way I can preserve all my programs that I have installed, as that would be a VERY long time just to redownload EVERYTHING again…?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 04, 2008, 11:09:26 PM[/size][hr]well I notice you are online, but anyway I backed everything I could up, and now reinstalling the system. so it is kinda a bit late now<br>
however I did screenshot the entire installed list so I know what I should get.</p>
