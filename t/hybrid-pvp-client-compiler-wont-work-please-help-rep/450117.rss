    <description>So im using a hybrid pvp v3 client, and I made some changes, I want to compile, but I can&#39;t seem to get the compiler to work, I inserted my jdk in replacement of the old one. Heres the compiler.  &lt;blockquote&gt;@echo off
Title Compiler
&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_25\bin\java.exe&quot; -d ./Class/ Java/*.java Java/sign/*.java
pause&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Will rep++!</description>

or why dont you tell them how to fix the problem and then explain how you did it? like last night you wouldn’t help me fix my error and your answers you gave me did no good… i still have the error i had, and i wont fix it until someone tells me how, and once they tell me how, they explain how they did it, maybe you wont spoon feed the answers because you just want to post boost and dont know how to fix any on these issues yourself…<br>
spoon feeding is telling someone how to fix a problem and then leaving them to be.<br>
actually helping and being helpful would be telling someone how to fix the problem and then showing them how you figured it out…</p>
<p>in math the teacher doesnt give a test and say figure it out… they teach you (spoon feed) then evaluate what you have been taught and if you fail the teacher explains how to arrive at the correct answer. you speak as if you are ignorant, and I am sure you are not, just think about it tho.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Well now everyone knows where that “DUDE ROCKET LOL UR ANSWERS R NOT HELPFUL” crap came from. I’m sorry that you don’t posses enough knowledge to do research and TEACH YOURSELF. I’m not a teacher, and I’m sure as hell not about to teach the children with bitter attitudes because I won’t hold their hands.</p>
<p>You say I speak as though I’m ignorant? I think you should re-read what you just posted.[/quote]<br>
Come on guys stop arguing on a help thread lol… Lets get back on topic?<br>
OT: vouching for The Wanderer’s idea… xD IDE would make your dev days a lot easier. IDE of my choice is Eclipse</p>

<p>Respectable Post, Rocket no one is asking you to be a teacher. If you dont want to give someone the answer and then tell them how u got it then you dont have to post at all. If your just going to say figure it out yourself then why even post in the help section?</p>
<p>No offense to you at all. Its obvious you know what your doing, but when other players (new coders)  need help they are obviously not going to be able to figure it out. Thus the point of a help section.</p>

<p>Helping people by NOT spoon-feeding them the answer is the best way to help people. This way they might actually learn something themselves, instead of just having it handed to them on a silver platter. If you knew how many people I’ve actually helped then you’d have a different tune.</p>

              <p>redemtion dont facepalm me you obviously know nothing about coding, he could have a 64 bit operating system or a 32 bit, the x86 is usually with certain version of 32bit vista and/ or older 64bit windows (xp, or 97) or windows 7. so get out of here with you facepalm crap. I had the same problem he did, and guess what I fixed it. also arent you trying to spell “redemption”? because redemtion is not a word…</p>

<p>also change the<br>
1.6.0_25 to what ever version of java you have to find that out open cmd and do:</p>
<p>java -version</p>
<p>you should have 1.7.0_02 or 1.7.0_03</p>
<p>remove the x86 and then try if not put the x86 back, and change the 1.6.0_25 if that doesnt do it, then keep the 1.7.0_(number here) and just remove the x86</p>
