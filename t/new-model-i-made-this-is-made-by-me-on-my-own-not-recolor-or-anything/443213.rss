    <description>[size=24pt]Okay, since I &quot;Use&quot; to recolor and everyone kept saying I shouldn&#39;t and should make my own, SO I DID! :D. I really hope you guys love it, I do not have the ints :(. The name of this model by me is called..... Robot Head! lololol. Just try to find some Ints and match it, lol. So the pictures are below! (:[/size]

<p>Your right, :). Thanks so much for the reply! :)…</p>
<p>I’m just going to stay with Meta though. :l I cba to do any other, I know your right but I just gonna keep doing Meta, Thanks a lot though! (:</p>
