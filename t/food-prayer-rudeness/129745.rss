    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/food-prayer-rudeness/129745</link>
    <description>okay so i am a pker a mini gamer and i play alot of thing that have to do with prayer and food well when i go pking i go in f2p and p2p
and both worlds i can insulted people calling me a newb, nub,noob and other things because i use it.

what i am trying to say is why do they do it, it is one of jagexs things they put and i don&#39;t like to be insulted buy players who don&#39;t use prayer just because they can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to.

and when i am at dual arena i will stake something and they will to so i sometime use food if it is good and i got flamed but people calling me a safer a noob a newb a nub etc.
why can&#39;t people just have fun and if they don&#39;t like it then don&#39;t fight them or talk to them or go get the same thing then fight.
thats all</description>
