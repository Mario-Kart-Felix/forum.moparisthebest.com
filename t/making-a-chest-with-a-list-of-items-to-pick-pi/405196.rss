    <title>Making a chest with a list of items to pick [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-chest-with-a-list-of-items-to-pick-pi/405196</link>
    <description>Ok so i have been researching this for a while and this is extremely urgent as well. I have been looking for tutorials or snippets for this and it doesn&#39;t seem like there is something like this. Ok so what I&#39;m, looking for is a single chest that has options to pick 4 different types of Armour. I&#39;ve seen a tutorial on how to do this but it&#39;s with either one item or just random items with no options at all. So please help. I have a Project Insanity source BTW</description>
