    <description>(Sorry if my explanation is off) 

Lets say you have a table &quot;Members&quot;. This table includes &lt;id&gt; &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt; &lt;group_id&gt;

For the sake of explanation, each member will be given a random number between 1-100 every time they request a number. Would you create a new table, &quot;Random&quot; and have each id correspond to their initial account?

&lt;id&gt; &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt; &lt;group_id&gt;
0  admin  password 0
1  player1  password 1
2 player2 password 1 
3 player3 password 1


Let&#39;s say player1, player2, and player3 get some random numbers and the output is

Table : Random : Structure &lt;id&gt; &lt;number&gt;
1 100
1 30
2 50
3 50
2 60
3 80
1 90
3 50 
2 50

Each player has 3 numbers, but at different times. Now my project consists of thousands of numbers, ultimately probably an average of 200,000 random numbers generated per year.

How would you approach the situation?</description>

              <p>Serialization is a different way of looking at it. Since you are technically representing a single data structure with text, you are still retaining an atomic type. It would really be context-specific to evaluate whether you would be fine continuing that strategy, or if you would be better off representing the array as a table instead, where its elements are mapped within the table. In situations where you would want to compare elements within the array as part of manipulating the database, obviously you would not be able to do this very easily if it’s a non-atomic serialized value, nor would you have any sort of proper relations setup within the database.</p>

<p>Yes, that’s exactly how you do it. You need to establish the relationship between your “random values table” and your “members table.” If each member can have zero or one random value, then your random values table just needs to have a foreign key pointing to the member id, and then the random value. If you want your members to have zero or more random values each, then you basically do the exact same thing, with the understanding that there can be multiple entries with the same foreign key. Although it is bad practice, this random values table has no inherent primary key (for sake of convention, you could add a surrogate key or something, but it wouldn’t really be used in many ways I can see now).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Biggest thing you need to know about relational databases is atomic structures.

<p>Not sure if this is related or not. But I really do like to abuse serialize() an use it on an array, and dump that into the database directly lol. What’s a better method? I just like using serialize() and unserialize() for convienience.</p>

Simple make one table for these ‘numbers’. MySQL should handle it. If not, make tables based upon the players names i.e. a-f g-l m-r s-v w-z, or something.</p>
