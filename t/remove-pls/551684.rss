<p>How about listing features. Is it a pay to win or vote to win? What xp rate is the server? Is there anything this server has that many others don’t? Is it a pk, economy, ect? Is it an remake of any kind? Just examples there. Also you may want to put in pictures as well. I personally don’t care for them much, but also don’t mine them, and the rest of the community seems to crave them for ads.</p>
