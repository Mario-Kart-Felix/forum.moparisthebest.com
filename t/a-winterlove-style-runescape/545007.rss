    <title>A winterlove style runescape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-winterlove-style-runescape/545007</link>
    <description>Just a theoretical question, but could a game like RuneScape, packed full of content, run as fast and as stable as it is if it were set up like a generic winterlove server?

To reiterate, winterlove servers generally have everything packed into one file(client.java).

I&#39;m not talking about the way that winterlove&#39;s engine runs, I&#39;m talking if jagex could have packed it all into one class for the most part.

I&#39;ve wondered this for like a week or two. I don&#39;t know if it could because I put shit all over the place(probably too much)</description>

we aren’t talking about that</p>
<p>op asked if packing everything into one file will reduce the performance of a server and the answer is no. if you have a deltascape server and take everything redundant out of the client class, then put it in its own class will the server magically perform better?</p>
<p>maybe ‘design’ wasn’t the right word to use but the main point doesn’t change</p>

<p>While you sort of have a point - Java method call overhead is negligible. Very fast. It can optimise them out almost certainly better than you can, where possible, and even when it can’t, the penalty isn’t worth thinking about really.</p>

[/quote]<br>
… yes it does</p>
<p>The fallacy that different design patterns have no direct impact on application performance is really common sense. If you take a moment to think about it, a program with a complex design pattern will more than likely have to invoke a multitude amount of subroutines, as to where a more simple design has all the data more closely present. Note that this is NOT the only way a more advanced pattern can effect a program. Often a more complex design pattern is chosen for the sake of future expansion, in which case a minor performance loss is offered in return.</p>

<p>In the end it all depends on what you want to accomplish, sometimes cramming everything one a single file is the most logical thing to do and other times it would be to expand it upon hundreds of files. In this particular situation the latter would be most desirable.[/quote]<br>
wait so you’re saying that if I take the exact same code and just structure it differently you’ll see a noticeable difference in performance?</p>
<p>just can’t see the logic behind that, I mean if you bake a cake and then turn it upside down or put all of the icing in the middle instead of on the top its still going to taste like cake</p>

              <p>Just a theoretical question, but could a game like RuneScape, packed full of content, run as fast and as stable as it is if it were set up like a generic winterlove server?</p>
<p>To reiterate, winterlove servers generally have everything packed into one file(client.java).</p>
<p>I’m not talking about the way that winterlove’s engine runs, I’m talking if jagex could have packed it all into one class for the most part.</p>
<p>I’ve wondered this for like a week or two. I don’t know if it could because I put shit all over the place(probably too much)</p>
