    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-getting-a-new-server-online/420093</link>
    <description>Hello, I am new to coding servers but have some experience coding rs bots in the past(so I am not entirely new at this). I have downloaded a client and source. I have made some minor changes to the look of the loading screen and added some new commands etc. The problem is when I upload the client to mediafire and my friends download it they cannot connect to the server and they get the error. Server is offline. I have done the basic port forwarding with my gateway. I have a no-ip and have put it in the gui.java it looks like this:System.out.println(&quot;Attempting to Connect&quot;);
Serverip = &quot;submissionpkz.no-ip.org&quot;;

and run my personal client looking like this
System.out.println(&quot;Attempting to Connect&quot;);
Serverip = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;

I Have heard that in the class.java you are supposed to change the ip but I have read through the entire code/script and cant find it.
Any Help would be greatly appreciated.</description>

              <p>I get this error message when No-ip is open or closed with the server open and closed I think I may have a few options incorrect on the portforward set up. I have followed the guide very closely but it seems it does not work. Any suggestions/ can you troubleshoot it through TV? I hate to ask but I am getting very frustrated.</p>
<p>Error: I could not see your service on 184.147.113.13 on port (43594)<br>
Reason: Connection refused</p>
<p><strong>When uTorrent is open it says success</strong> Should I change my uTorrent port or just run the server with uTorrent open. I heard the latter can block the port?</p>
<p>I have to go to school until about 3pm EST tomorrow so if you can think of anything that can help it would be greatly appreciated,<br>
either post it here or email it to <a href="mailto:chris___33@hotmail.com">chris___33@hotmail.com</a> (that’s 3 underscores)</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
