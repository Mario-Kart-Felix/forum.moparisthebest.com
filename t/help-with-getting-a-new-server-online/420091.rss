    <title>Help With Getting A New Server Online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-getting-a-new-server-online/420091</link>
    <description>Hello, I am new to coding servers but have some experience coding rs bots in the past(so I am not entirely new at this). I have downloaded a client and source. I have made some minor changes to the look of the loading screen and added some new commands etc. The problem is when I upload the client to mediafire and my friends download it they cannot connect to the server and they get the error. Server is offline. I have done the basic port forwarding with my gateway. I have a no-ip and have put it in the gui.java it looks like this:System.out.println(&quot;Attempting to Connect&quot;);
Serverip = &quot;submissionpkz.no-ip.org&quot;;

and run my personal client looking like this
System.out.println(&quot;Attempting to Connect&quot;);
Serverip = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;

I Have heard that in the class.java you are supposed to change the ip but I have read through the entire code/script and cant find it. 
Any Help would be greatly appreciated.</description>

              <p>I have been using eclipse and Ctrl+F I only have a place to change the IP in GUI.java and do not have EGUI.java the Client.java does not have a place to set and Ip. To put my server online I upload the client with GUI.java having <a href="http://my.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">my.no-ip.org</a> and then I run the server on my computer and change the GUI.java to 127.0.0.1 to play. This doesnt allow my friends to connect am I doing anything blatantly wrong? And is there a way to troubleshoot this?</p>

              <p>Are you port fowarding? also Check Client.java on client side. &amp; EGUI.java on client side (if u have it) and change the local ip to your no-ip.</p>
<p>Also a great tip for you would be to first Use Eclipse to code.<br>
Its a coders best friend. Also Try using<br>
Ctrl+f to load the find prompt to quickly check for a line of text in ur code. Instead of reading through it all.</p>
