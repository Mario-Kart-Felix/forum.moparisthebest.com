              <p>If you really don’t know much about computers, don’t build one, trust me. Just buy one, if you live in new zealand, I really don’t know what good brans they have there.</p>
<p>And if you’re into high performance gaming, a good RAM, processor and a Graphic Card would do. Good graphic cards uses AGP and PCI-Express slots, PCI are not that good. Make sure the computer you’re getting can support AGP or PCI-E(express), all computers should have PCI slots, but those slots are just for sound cards, and other things such as extra USB ports, etc.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to build a computer, It’s cheaper but you’re going to have to face the fact of buying a motherboard, windows xp/vista, power supply box, hard drives, ram, procesor, CD drive, and configuring the drivers and the installing the windows it would be a pain…</p>
<p>Dell offers good computers, but mostly all there computers only comes with PCI slots, HP is a very good brand aswell(don’t know much about those, but there good).</p>
<p>If you’re getting a laptop, make sure theres a good graphic card in it, because you cant buy one separately and add it later, and some good RAM(about 1GB+).</p>
<p>What kind of games are you talking about? Runescape? doesn’t really require anything… BattleField 2, World of Warcraft, Counter Strike, etc does. Go to the game website and see the requirements it needs in order to run…</p>
<p>Hopes this helps, if you need anymore questions, just give me a pm <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Dell Core with EXCELLENT RAM, hardrive, and ESPECIALLY AN EXCELLENT GRAPHICS CARD (A MUST). Try XP or Vista. I reccomend vista because it looks cooler, and you are able to see your graphic ratings on it. But usually XP holds more tricks. Some people say XP is better gamer than vista, but I think they are equal.<br>
I have a Toshiba and an Acer, both laptops.</p>
