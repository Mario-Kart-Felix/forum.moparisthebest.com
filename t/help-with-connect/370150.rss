    <title>Help with connect?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-connect/370150</link>
    <description>Ok, I have been trying to make a private server (317) for about 2 years now... :( I have tried hundreds of sources and clients completely reset my computer several times and screwed up three routers trying to get somthing to work... I have done everything the tutorials say i&#39;ve done everything people have told me would help... Whenever i get the server running my client can connect on the same computer when the ip is localhost, but as soon as i change the ip and recompile nobody can connect. I know people say this is easy but i think there is somthing wrong with what im doing... I have no-ip set up, I have port forwarded, I am absolutely sure the source works, I also have set the ip correctly and have the right java but i can never get the server to connect to external clients. Maybe someone can help on teamviewer??? :) idk just please someone help... in all the time i&#39;ve been doing this not one person has been able to fix my problem... or even know what it is... :confused:</description>

</aside>
<p>I fixed it in the quote. This will allow him to connect to his client, but now others. You should try making the IP your IP but going</p>
<p>to <a href="http://whatismyip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">whatismyip.com</a> and copy and pasting it in the client. Put it in ALL of the IP places. Search things like no-ip, 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>to be absolutely sure that you changed all the IP’s to your IP. Once done, put it up for download and when people start</p>
<p>playing, change ALL the IP’s back to 127.0.0.1</p>
