    <title>Gothic Series</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gothic-series/547259</link>
    <description>So the Gothix Series is on sale at the moment on Steam. Can anybody verify if the game is any good perhaps if you have played it before? I&#39;ve been looking for a decent RPG to play and for the price it seems right but I don&#39;t want something where the controls or something is going to be iffy.</description>
