    <description>center]This is a tutorial on how to start coding a 637 source(beginners) No pics, its not that hard to read![/center]
[center]Step 1- downloading Jdk[/center]
[center]Step 2- Downloading Winrar [/center]
[center]Step 3- Downloading Source&amp;Client[/center]
[center]step 4- Making it so you can log into you server(not online only you can log in)[/center]
[center]Step 5- Coding your source(making yourself owner and changing welcome msg)[/center]
[center]Step 6- Adding Npc&#39;s[/center]
[center]Step 7- Changeing the bank[/center]
[center]Step 8- Adding a command(:[/center]

Step 1
Download JDK here - [url=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html]http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[/url]
Step 2
Download winrar, this link should work - [url=http://download.cnet.com/WinRAR-32-bit/3000-2250_4-10007677.html]http://download.cnet.com/WinRAR-32-bit/3000-2250_4-10007677.html[/url]
Step 3
Download a client and sourcem advice download this 1- [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,532756.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,532756.0.html[/url]
Step 4
Okay now that youv downloaded these, dont forget to extract source and client files to your desktop.
after that open your client file, and right click run.bat and change the ip in there and put 0.0.0.0 after that save and close.
Next open server files and click run, if it comes up with error, right click on run.bat and it&#39;ll say something like [code]&quot;C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.6.0_21/bin/java&quot;[/code] now take that and replce the jdk version with yours, to figure yours out go to your downloads find your jdk version and put it [code]&quot;C:/Program Files/Java/right here/bin/java&quot;[/code]. then do the same for your compiler.
Then run your server and open your client and run it and log in.
W00t your logged in your server, but what? it says welcome to torva scape and your not owner??! uhg
no worries there&#39;s still step 5!
Step 5-
To change where it says welcome to torva scape and all the other writing go to [code]src/org/dementhium/net/actionsender.java[/code]
when you have that opened do Ctrl f and search for welcome to and it will say Torvapkz or something like that and just replace all of there server names with yours and you can change other writing to, but use your brain and dont replace code, now search for mod austin and replace his name with yours, (username) now exit that and compile.
Step 6- Now adding npc
To start go to your server files and go to [code]data/npcs/npcspawns.java[/code]
now go under custom shops
it&#39;ll hava all the code now heres how u put in your npc
[code]553 2225 4963 0 2 false[/code]
the 553 is the npc id the 2225 is Abs x and 4963 is Abs Y and 0 is the heigth  the rest dont worry about
now add this somewhere in the custom shops [code]553 2225 4963 0 2 false[/code]
now save and exit you just added an npc, now do you still wanna check it out? mk compile it and exit client and exit the server cmd if its still running and re run it, open client and then do ` its in the top left corner of ur keypad, it&#39;ll make your screen over the client turn a light blue shade no type tele 2225 4963 and move and theres the npc you just spawned,
Now if you dont mind the guy walking around in a small area you can just go back to ` and type n npcidhere and they&#39;ll spawn and they will stay there until you delete them which you do at the buttom of npcscpawns.
Step 7-
Ohh nooo it still says bank of torva blah
so go to [code]src/org/dementhium/model/player/bank[/code]
Then do Ctrl f and search for bank of, it&#39;ll come up something like bank of Torva something, replace Torva with your server name
now if you havent noticed theres alot of items in your bank if you want that gone do this
Delete everything from  [code]player.getBank().getContainer().add(new Item(995, 2137000000));[/code]
to                                 [code]player.getSkills().addExperience(23, 14000000); that also deletes the starting out with 99 skills[/code]
exit save and compile.
Step 8- Adding commands
Now this depends on what kind of commands
8- Adding a teleport command
First go to [code]Src/org/dementhium/content/Commands.java[/code]
Now search for [code]&quot;if (command[0].equals(&quot;shops&quot;))[/code] {&quot; (without the &quot;)
and copy and paste this 
		[code]}
		if (command[0].equals(&quot;shops&quot;)) {
			player.sendMessage(&quot;Have fun shopping!&quot;);
			player.teleport(2229, 4963, 0);[/code]
now where it says shops is the name of the command, now the 2229 is the abs X and the 4963 is Abs Y and the 0 is the heigth
and Have fun shopping! is what it says whenever you use this command. 
so now lets edit this and make it look like this
[code]		}
		if (command[0].equals(&quot;dray&quot;)) {
			player.sendMessage(&quot;Welcome to Draynor!&quot;);
			player.teleport(3093, 3244, 0);[/code]
Now save exit.
Now compile rerun server log in and do the dray
and your in draynor village.
Now This is the end of Tutorial, i may come back and add more(:
Thx and have a good day, Leave comments, If you need help leave a comment!(:</description>

              <p>Good job on contributing to the community, but tutorials like this have been released time after time. The revision of the source doesn’t change any form of the language, but only the packaging and variables used. I guess this is good for someone that has no clue what Java is or how to make a server, but if you really want to be dedicated and not be a “spoon fed” person, you might want to actually study up on the language itself first.</p>

              <p>This seem’s more of a Leeching guide than it does a Beginners guide…<br>
Step 5 is what id do…</p>
<p>Look Over Folders/Code’s check for any error’s etc that need to be fixed.<br>
Get to know the source a little bit play around on it for a bit find out what needs to be fixed etc<br>
no one will release a perfect ready to host server enless  you buy one or something…<br>
Main things to always check is combat and a few skill’s</p>
<p>i dont change my server’s name or welcome messages etc till i completed my project, kind of like a finishing touch.</p>
<p>OT- Maybe add how to change the ip address and maybe some error fixes that some people may get.</p>

              <p>center]This is a tutorial on how to start coding a 637 source(beginners) No pics, its not that hard to read![/center]<br>
[center]Step 1- downloading Jdk[/center]<br>
[center]Step 2- Downloading Winrar [/center]<br>
[center]Step 3- Downloading Source&amp;Client[/center]<br>
[center]step 4- Making it so you can log into you server(not online only you can log in)[/center]<br>
[center]Step 5- Coding your source(making yourself owner and changing welcome msg)[/center]<br>
[center]Step 6- Adding Npc’s[/center]<br>
[center]Step 7- Changeing the bank[/center]<br>
[center]Step 8- Adding a command(:[/center]</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
Download JDK here - <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a><br>
Step 2<br>
Download winrar, this link should work - <a href="http://download.cnet.com/WinRAR-32-bit/3000-2250_4-10007677.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://download.cnet.com/WinRAR-32-bit/3000-2250_4-10007677.html</a><br>
Step 3<br>
Download a client and sourcem advice download this 1- <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,532756.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,532756.0.html</a><br>
Step 4<br>
Okay now that youv downloaded these, dont forget to extract source and client files to your desktop.<br>
after that open your client file, and right click run.bat and change the ip in there and put 0.0.0.0 after that save and close.<br>
Next open server files and click run, if it comes up with error, right click on run.bat and it’ll say something like <code>"C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.6.0_21/bin/java"</code> now take that and replce the jdk version with yours, to figure yours out go to your downloads find your jdk version and put it <code>"C:/Program Files/Java/right here/bin/java"</code>. then do the same for your compiler.<br>
Then run your server and open your client and run it and log in.<br>
W00t your logged in your server, but what? it says welcome to torva scape and your not owner??! uhg<br>
no worries there’s still step 5!<br>
Step 5-<br>
To change where it says welcome to torva scape and all the other writing go to <code>src/org/dementhium/net/actionsender.java</code><br>
when you have that opened do Ctrl f and search for welcome to and it will say Torvapkz or something like that and just replace all of there server names with yours and you can change other writing to, but use your brain and dont replace code, now search for mod austin and replace his name with yours, (username) now exit that and compile.<br>
Step 6- Now adding npc<br>
To start go to your server files and go to <code>data/npcs/npcspawns.java</code><br>
now go under custom shops<br>
it’ll hava all the code now heres how u put in your npc</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>the 553 is the npc id the 2225 is Abs x and 4963 is Abs Y and 0 is the heigth  the rest dont worry about<br>
now add this somewhere in the custom shops <code>553 2225 4963 0 2 false</code><br>
now save and exit you just added an npc, now do you still wanna check it out? mk compile it and exit client and exit the server cmd if its still running and re run it, open client and then do <code>its in the top left corner of ur keypad, it'll make your screen over the client turn a light blue shade no type tele 2225 4963 and move and theres the npc you just spawned, Now if you dont mind the guy walking around in a small area you can just go back to</code> and type n npcidhere and they’ll spawn and they will stay there until you delete them which you do at the buttom of npcscpawns.<br>
Step 7-<br>
Ohh nooo it still says bank of torva blah<br>
so go to <code>src/org/dementhium/model/player/bank</code><br>
Then do Ctrl f and search for bank of, it’ll come up something like bank of Torva something, replace Torva with your server name<br>
now if you havent noticed theres alot of items in your bank if you want that gone do this<br>
Delete everything from  <code>player.getBank().getContainer().add(new Item(995, 2137000000));</code><br>
to                                 <code>player.getSkills().addExperience(23, 14000000); that also deletes the starting out with 99 skills</code><br>
exit save and compile.<br>
Step 8- Adding commands<br>
Now this depends on what kind of commands<br>
8- Adding a teleport command<br>
First go to <code>Src/org/dementhium/content/Commands.java</code><br>
Now search for <code>"if (command[0].equals("shops"))</code> {" (without the ")<br>
and copy and paste this<br>
<code>}
		if (command[0].equals("shops")) {
			player.sendMessage("Have fun shopping!");
			player.teleport(2229, 4963, 0);</code><br>
now where it says shops is the name of the command, now the 2229 is the abs X and the 4963 is Abs Y and the 0 is the heigth<br>
and Have fun shopping! is what it says whenever you use this command.<br>
so now lets edit this and make it look like this</p>
<p><code>		}
		if (command[0].equals("dray")) {
			player.sendMessage("Welcome to Draynor!");
			player.teleport(3093, 3244, 0);</code><br>
Now save exit.<br>
Now compile rerun server log in and do the dray<br>
and your in draynor village.<br>
Now This is the end of Tutorial, i may come back and add more(:<br>
Thx and have a good day, Leave comments, If you need help leave a comment!(:</p>
