    <description>If any of you play 2moons, can anyone give me an explanation of why the minilauncher for the game doesn,t wrok if you launch it from your desktop or from the game site itself. My comp says that there&#39;s a program blocking it, but i don&#39;t know which one it is.

If somebody has had the same problem and fixed it, can you please tell me how to fix it?? It would bne much appreciated.</description>
