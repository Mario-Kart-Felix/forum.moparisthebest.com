    <title>Only makes one at a time?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/only-makes-one-at-a-time/346250</link>
    <description>Ok i want it to take every essence of mine and turn it into a item in the  amount of ess you had in inven for example.. you have 28 essence and you click the item and get 28 orbs. or if you do the same thing but with 20 ess you get 20 orbs? heres what i have so far.

[code=java]if(UsedOnObjectID == 2152){
		int essence = amountOfItem(7936);
		if (playerLevel[playerRunecrafting] &lt; 20)
		{
			sM(&quot;You do not have enough runecrafting to craft this.&quot;);
			sM(&quot;You need at least 20 runecrafting to runecraft this.&quot;);
			return;
		}
		if (!playerHasItem(7936))
		{
			sM(&quot;You do not have any rune essence to craft. Please click the chests at deposit center.&quot;);
			return;
		}
			deleteItem(7936, amountOfItem(7936));
		addItem(573, amountOfItem(7936));
		sM(&quot;You Create some orbs.&quot;);
		specGFX(186);
		setAnimation(791);
		return;
	}[/code]
But it only makes one orb for one ess.. so it only removes 1 ess and adds 1 orb in its place? how will i make it do them all at one time.</description>
