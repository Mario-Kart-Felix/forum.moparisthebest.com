              <p>Unfortunately, its very hard to keep an 100% uptime,</p>
<p>but there is no way to get back up to 100% other than just remaking the server and readding it,</p>
<p>but if you fell below 100% at any time, it means that your server was offline for a time,</p>
<p>and if you server was offline even for a few minutes, then its not up 100% so you shouldnt have 100% uptime if your server hasnt been up 100% since you created it</p>

I dont youse Mopars status Page But Can you post more than 1? because if you can just make another ip on ino-ip and use that<br>

<p>I suppose you could, but you’d need to change your ip address for it to work. You’re better of sticking with your current one.[/quote]</p>
<p>i Guess so but If he really wanted to do that he could just use a web proxy</p>

<p>lol, its simple. Just create a new ip at <a href="http://No-Ip.com">No-Ip.com</a>, and you have two posts saying online. Its a good idea. You will have more people playing.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure it’d check the hosts actual IP, not just the no-ip. If it didn’t thats just moronic.</p>
