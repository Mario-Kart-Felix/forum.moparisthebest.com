    <title>Harry Truman&#39;s Policies</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/harry-trumans-policies/85036</link>
    <description>I have to right about &quot;my&quot; opinion, but hopefully I could get a little help from you guys.

* This has to be like I am a Newspaper writer from a different country than the U.S., and I have to explain if Harry Trumans Policies were/were not strict enough...

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here is the layout:
------------------
My Role - Foreign Policy Analyzer
Audience - American Newspaper Readers
Format - Newspaper Editorial
Topic - Were Harry Truman&#39;s policies to contain the spread of communism too soft?&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Any help is appreciated...


[b]NOTE:[/b] This is during the Cold War.


Thanks,
