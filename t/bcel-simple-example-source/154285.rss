    <title>[BCEL] - Simple Example Source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bcel-simple-example-source/154285</link>
    <description>I was just fooling around with BCEL (learning some of the basics) and I wrote a program that modifes the String variable in one .class file with BCEL and replaces it with a hook that returns the desired variable. Anyways, its useless and such but I know that something this simple can help alot anyways.
