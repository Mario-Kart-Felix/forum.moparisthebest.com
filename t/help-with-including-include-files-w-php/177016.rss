    <title>Help with including Include files w/PHP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-including-include-files-w-php/177016</link>
    <description>OK, so I tried to include a .inc file in PHP.

It has like, the database info and stuff like that.

But when I included it, the text would show up on my php file.

Help?</description>

I just thought that you could have like stufff that wouldn’t show up in there <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>So should my database information just be included with SQL files?<br>
Or should I just have them in my PHP script?[/quote]<br>
u cant just include the sql file<br>
u have to run mysql</p>
<p>u could do $file = file_get_contents()</p>
