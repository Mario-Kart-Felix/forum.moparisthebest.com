    <description>Im trying to make a runescape private server , but i cant portforward.

This is how i tried to portforward : Game &amp; Application Sharing - Create a new game or application - NAME : RSPSU - manual entry of port maps - Protocol : Any

http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=108bjx1&amp;s=7

And then i assigned the RSPSU to my dell laptop.

So my NO - IP DUC was running , with 1 host testscapeaa.no-ip.biz . I went to google server status checker. Entered the ip and it said offline ! I didnt know what was the problem , so i thought my internet provider is blocking the ports , so i opened them up , but still offline. Whats the problem , i really really need to portforward ! Would anyone be so kind and do the portforwarding for me with teamviewer , or tell me the problem ? 2 users have already tried to portforward my comp through teamviewer , Epic Steve , and whattehp406. Epic steve did the automatic portforwarding thing but still na , and he started ignoring me. And whattehp406 couldnt do it either , he doesent know whats the problem , he got his server up and running in 5 mins , but he couldnt help me !

So is some one here a really experienced person , who could help me ?
I really need help !

So how do i open the port 43594 on thomson tg784</description>
