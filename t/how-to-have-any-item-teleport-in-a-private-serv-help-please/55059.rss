              <p>you cant execute them. If you want to get items, use the ::pickup #### or ::item #### commands.note: u need to be mod/admin for that. to be one, change your playerrights in your char file to 1 for mod or to 2 for admin(or to 3 for owner)[br][size=1]Posted on: February 04, 2007, 05:08:01 PM[/size][hr]and i forgot something-</p>
