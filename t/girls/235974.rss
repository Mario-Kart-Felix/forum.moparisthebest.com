    <description>Ok, I have not experience with girls what so ever. Today I was sitting in the bus, on my usual trip home and a girl was sitting in front of my facing away from me. She often looked at me, and when I sat down behind her she began playing with her hair. Does that mean anything at all? I somehow recall that it means a girl is interested in someone if she does that, but I might make the truth more positive for my well-being. As I said, I have no experience with girls, but what I do know is that it was a nice looking girl. I didn&#39;t have the balls to say anything to her because she might aswell be pissed off at me or whatever.</description>

But if you know them, just get a normal conversation started and since it’s halloween time, you could be like, “Would you like to go a corn maze or haunted house this saturday?” If she says yes, then cool…no, then oh well, try again</p>

That’s where i was going with that. I wan’t being an ass, like yourself, I was simply stating common sense.

<p>Anyways, some good advice would be for him (or anyone in this situation) to talk to her. Don’t wait for a sign. Life doesn’t give you signs to wait on.</p>
