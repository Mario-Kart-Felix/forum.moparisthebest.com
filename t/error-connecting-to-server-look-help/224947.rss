    <description>Hi, i download allstar server source and i compiled it and all that, then i runned my server. At the same time i got my no-ip running in the background and it had the happy smiley face and said all dns connected. I have also port forwarded but im not 100 procent sure ive done it the right way. Or well im gonna upload a picture of how my port forwarding looks like. But before i do that i still have something to say, when i run my server it says Allstarscape v1 online, that&#39;s great because it works :). Now when i have my no-ip running at the same time, it is lasseown.no-ip.biz now when i enter it on silab and enter my username and pass that i want it gives me this error connecting to server unless how many times i try, i also tryed to disable my norton firewall i don&#39;t have Windows firewall on, and i also port forwarded btw, I CAN ONLY connect to my server if i use this 127.0.0.1 if i connect via 127.0.0.1 i get into allstar scape and i could also make my self owner server is fine, but no one else can join on this ip lasseown.no-ip.biz. Now i will post a picture of how i port forward i have zyXel.

I havent added my server on moparscape server list is thats why its down? Or maybe my port forwarding have been done incorectly? please help!</description>
