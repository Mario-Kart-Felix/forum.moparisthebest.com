    <title>Looking for some staff/help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-some-staff-help/534531</link>
    <description>I have a source from years ago when i use to host and play with my friends and such but now I want to bring it back and fix the problems make it public 
It&#39;s old name from back in the day was solid scape not sure if I want to stay with that or not but it is an 06 source of some kind the ip is up and running when I left the house this morning. Solidscape.no-ip.biz you are more than welcome to try and connect and check it out for some reason some clients crash as soon as logged in not sure why ? But anyway it is currently setup like normal runescape people/shops Xp rate I don&#39;t want to go into a big jumbled up mess ... I would like to bump up the dp at least x2 .... For right now I have a dedicated server at my house 10meg Internet I can allow team view etc just looking for some old school lovers that want to start up something real and good :)

Sry for no pics I am on my iPad at work I can post some this evening
