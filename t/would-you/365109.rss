    <description>If i were to make a runescape private server that had the same concept as frugooscape (don&#39;t say unrealscape because i&#39;m about to tell you the difference), but incorporated all the newer things such as godsword stances, skillcape emotes, and pretty much all the 474 emotes. Do you think it would be a hit or no?</description>

<p>RWT still happens, you’re correct they took it out for a reason which was to stop RWT, this measure failed therefore they should re-add it? If I’m wrong please feel free to correct me for I have not played runescape in a long time.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Topic</span></p>
<p>I think it’d be a great idea, all you need to worry about is the potential target audience it’s no secret that most people would rather play an easy server over a more challenging one. I personally would go for the more challenging one.</p>
<p>Me, Si Force and some others had an idea off creating something similar but in a island type layout. If you could create something hardly anyone uses such as that then people with brain cells will investigate the content and notice this server is different.</p>

A lot of the people who play RSPS are tired of the modern items of what RuneScape has. The point of RSPS servers (some) was to bring back the old days in the first place.</p>

I agree with the older game frame and stuff, but i just remember how kool frugooscape was. that is what got me where i am today. If it wern’t for frugooscape i woulda never been involved with RSPS or moparscape and was thinking i could make a tribute server, but i guess it does sound kinda lame.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Then go for it mate. You can try, but Frugooscape released all the 474 items which kind of ruined the point of the classic part about it in my opinion.[/quote]</p>
<p>So your sayin it would be better like without godswords and skillcapes and stuff like that? I mean now that i think about it, that would seem kinda rare to see in a server these days.</p>
