    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/squidipus/300614</link>
    <description>This isn&#39;t my concept. This was taken from a tutorial. I didn&#39;t actually follow the tutorial (except one lesson on retopalization, no idea how to do that in ZB), I just did it my own way so there is some differences which I made on a personal basis on what I wanted it to look like. For example, I didn&#39;t want my squid to have teeth or hair.

But anyways. Modeled and sculpted in ZBrush. Also textured in ZB, then brought in 3DS Max for shading and rendering. I composited him onto a picture of a counter in my house. Exact measurements were taken of everything and used for the setup of the scene. I replicated my camera in 3D with just about everything you can think of being the same. A HDRI I made of the room was used for lighting, and matched in rotation to the one I took pictures of, then I used light metering to make sure it was the same brightness to the 3D environment as it was IRL. Everything is perfectly scaled and the perspective and DOF are correct to the real life counterpart. 

After the render (a few hours for 3872x2592, the same dimensions as the original picture) I composited everything in Nuke. And now here it is. I was originally calling this Octo but then I realized it only had 6 arms, making it a squid. I don&#39;t like squids, so I&#39;ll just call it Squidipus. Originally because I was studying Rome/Greece/Etruscan history and was making a classical kind of name, but then I realized it also looks like Squid and Octopus combined lol.

Anyways. C&amp;C or whatnot.

              <p>All modeling and everything but rendering was done in zbrush.</p>
<p>Start with zpheres, just form a tentacle. Get to a resolution where there’s about 6-8 sides to the cylinder shape of the tentacle. Make what you want to be the bottom “flat”. I used the move brush for this, and I tried to mask off the top areas so I didn’t touch them. All the suckers were done with a custom alpha, basically the top of a tube in photoshop. A square image with a circle of white and a circle of black inside of it. Then blur it till you get what you want. Use the drag rectangle brush in the standard tool and the custom alpha, and up the zintensity til whatever you feel is appropriate, and then drag them out. Or for a more uniform version, use the track/stitch1/stitch2/stitch3 brush with the alpha and roll them along the tentacles.</p>
<p>If you’re more of a visual person or can’t understand that, then I’ll make a video sometime this week.</p>
