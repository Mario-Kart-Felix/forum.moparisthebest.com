    <title>Shop prices (Not a ridiculous question)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shop-prices-not-a-ridiculous-question/278081</link>
    <description>Ok, this is what I wanted to do. I recently added working runecrafting to my server and I want to make it so my players have to buy rune essence for 5000 coins, but at the same time make it so if they want to sell it back, it&#39;ll only sell for 152 coins. Now, I thought I understood how the item config file worked, but apparently I don&#39;t. This is what i did to the rune essence item.

[code]item = 1436	Rune_essence	An_uncharged_Rune_Stone.	152.77337333897773	5000.77337333897773	152.89937509644053	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0[/code]

I thought the first value was selling the item, second value was buying the item, and third value was high alching it. I saved and compiled (even though I didn&#39;t need to compile this file) and it still says I can sell and buy it for 5000 coins. How can I fix this? What do the first three values mean?</description>

<p>That wouldn’t matter because the first and second number are already different. That means it would have been a different sell price and buy price already… You get what I’m saying?</p>

</aside>
<p>No. No you don’t. The shops config file is only used for the shops integer id number, the name of the shop it displays at the top of the shop interface window, the items in the shops, and the amount of those items in the shop. Prices have nothing to do with the shops config.</p>
