    <title>Cloning may soon be used for organ transplants!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cloning-may-soon-be-used-for-organ-transplants/20522</link>
    <description>Just an interesting thing I found, thought I would share.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Scientists hope that one day cloning can be used to generate tissues and organs for transplants. To do this, DNA would be extracted from the person in need of a transplant and inserted into an enucleated egg. After the egg containing the patient&#39;s DNA starts to divide, embryonic stem cells that can be transformed into any type of tissue would be harvested. The stem cells would be used to generate an organ or tissue that is a genetic match to the recipient. In theory, the cloned organ could then be transplanted into the patient without the risk of tissue rejection. If organs could be generated from cloned human embryos, the need for organ donation could be significantly reduced. 

Many challenges must be overcome before &quot;cloned organ&quot; transplants become reality. More effective technologies for creating human embryos, harvesting stem cells, and producing organs from stem cells would have to be developed. In 2001, scientists with the biotechnology company Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) reported that they had cloned the first human embryos; however, the only embryo to survive the cloning process stopped developing after dividing into six cells. In February 2002, scientists with the same biotech company reported that they had successfully transplanted kidney-like organs into cows. The team of researchers created a cloned cow embryo by removing the DNA from an egg cell and then injecting the DNA from the skin cell of the donor cow&#39;s ear. Since little is known about manipulating embryonic stem cells from cows, the scientists let the cloned embryos develop into fetuses. The scientists then harvested fetal tissue from the clones and transplanted it into the donor cow. In the three months of observation following the transplant, no sign of immune rejection was observed in the transplant recipient.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[/quote] I doubt it. About a decade ago, they cloned a sheep or soemthin (I think it was a sheep) It was the first thing ever to be cloned, but it was a failure. The sheep that the clone was cloned by died after it was cloned, and the clone was crazy, it acted like it had rabies or somethin. The scieentists were so shocked and scared, that they never wanted anyone to try it again. So they burnt the notes. THey noted it in 1 of the world almanac time lines, but it jsut said first clone and then the name of the sheep (I forget the name) But then I did a little research and quickly found that out. Im not really sure if its true or not, though.</p>
<p>The point: There not gonna be cloning ANYTHING again anytime soon.[/quote]<br>
there has been more than just a sheep pigs and some others…<br>
UMM hasn’t a human already been cloned? i heard about it a baby girl was born then i did some research… and found this.</p>

Just an interesting thing I found, thought I would share.</p>
<p>[quote]Scientists hope that one day cloning can be used to generate tissues and organs for transplants. To do this, DNA would be extracted from the person in need of a transplant and inserted into an enucleated egg. After the egg containing the patient’s DNA starts to divide, embryonic stem cells that can be transformed into any type of tissue would be harvested. The stem cells would be used to generate an organ or tissue that is a genetic match to the recipient. In theory, the cloned organ could then be transplanted into the patient without the risk of tissue rejection. If organs could be generated from cloned human embryos, the need for organ donation could be significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Many challenges must be overcome before “cloned organ” transplants become reality. More effective technologies for creating human embryos, harvesting stem cells, and producing organs from stem cells would have to be developed. In 2001, scientists with the biotechnology company Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) reported that they had cloned the first human embryos; however, the only embryo to survive the cloning process stopped developing after dividing into six cells. In February 2002, scientists with the same biotech company reported that they had successfully transplanted kidney-like organs into cows. The team of researchers created a cloned cow embryo by removing the DNA from an egg cell and then injecting the DNA from the skin cell of the donor cow’s ear. Since little is known about manipulating embryonic stem cells from cows, the scientists let the cloned embryos develop into fetuses. The scientists then harvested fetal tissue from the clones and transplanted it into the donor cow. In the three months of observation following the transplant, no sign of immune rejection was observed in the transplant recipient.[/quote]<br>

[/quote] I doubt it. About a decade ago, they cloned a sheep or soemthin (I think it was a sheep) It was the first thing ever to be cloned, but it was a failure. The sheep that the clone was cloned by died after it was cloned, and the clone was crazy, it acted like it had rabies or somethin. The scieentists were so shocked and scared, that they never wanted anyone to try it again. So they burnt the notes. THey noted it in 1 of the world almanac time lines, but it jsut said first clone and then the name of the sheep (I forget the name) But then I did a little research and quickly found that out. Im not really sure if its true or not, though.</p>
<p>The point: There not gonna be cloning ANYTHING again anytime soon.[/quote]<br>
Wtf?<br>
None of your post made any sense…<br>

              <p>I didnt know they cloned a fricken human being lmao… Was it in the full article? I only skimmed through that 1 part he copy pasted. But, still, its not gonna happen anytime soon. They have to secure it to be safe, and then it has to be approved, and when it finally gets done through the process, itll tkae a while for it to spread nationwide. Just like day-time television  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>You are not exactly on the brightside. You seem to have forgotten about the time when they cloned a human being, just a few years ago. That’s all they ever talked about on the news for like a month straight, remember?</p>
