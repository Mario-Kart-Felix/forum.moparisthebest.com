    <title>Simple questions about the client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simple-questions-about-the-client/49481</link>
    <description>I&#39;m going to make this short and to the point

1) *IF* we were to reinvent aryan, coundn&#39;t we get trapped if the client does&#39;nt send any data on how the mouse is moving? PSB said that there was a system in the client that documented all mouse movements and sent them to the server. If the server doesn&#39;t receive this wouldn&#39;t we get banned? And if we sent fake mouse data, couldn&#39;t they check it and find that we aren&#39;t actually moving the mouse?

2) Does the client record keystrokes and send them to the Runescape server?

Thanks!</description>

We wouldn't.

This is part of the reason why pure Action Forcing is so detectable.  By getting the screen position of the NPC/Object/whatever you can simulate "smooth" mouse events on the applet component.
The implementation of HOW you get the position of where to move is key in detectability.

Yes.
