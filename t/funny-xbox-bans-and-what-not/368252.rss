    <description>Laughed when I saw this one..

Just found this, a website that contains people that attempted to mod their account and got banned.. Basically Xbox Live Ban Fails:
http://whywasibanned.com/

Those are links to the Xbox 360 ban appeal section.. Where most people get banned for Jtagging or account modding.

Also I recent posted on there because of an error I receive for black ops, the game glitched while I was playing online and ever since I got black ops I cannot play anymore.
Also Xbox Live Support cannot help you with any of the problems you may receive from Black Ops, they will even tell you that and also send you to Activision.

Let me tell you now that Activision could give a damn about their players and will most likely not help you if you receive any problems..
Overall I rate Activision: 6 bitches and a half!</description>

              <p>No a technician, well 2 technically told me while talking with them on xbox support.<br>
Also in most of their ban messages, they say “our research” and also they say the proof they found and what not… they will not share for whatever reasons.</p>

<p>Though, I don’t know, I figured the staff team to be giving a huge explanation about the whole situation of one’s ban, or full ban.</p>
<p>I don’t know about the detective part.</p>

              <p>I’m not surprised that Activision wouldn’t care about the player’s. I could imagine them being busy and not having time for members, however; if they have a support department; that is another story assuming they should be helping.</p>
<p>Xbox Live support - You shouldn’t be surprised assuming there for Xbox situation’s and so forth.</p>
<p>The current appeals given in the ban appeals were not surprising as well. At least the replies that were given by the staff team – they broke the rules, and therefore were given the consequences.</p>
