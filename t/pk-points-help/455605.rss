    <title>Pk points help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-points-help/455605</link>
    <description>Ok, So I own the server hybrid pvpv3. It is a [PI] server. So when players kill someone, they get 5 pk points.
But players are getting stuck at around 5-25 pk points, and they will not receive any more pk points. Is there
some kind of bug with the pk system? I really need this fixed! Someone please help me!</description>
