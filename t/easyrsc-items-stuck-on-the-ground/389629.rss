    <title>EasyRSC - Items stuck on the ground</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/easyrsc-items-stuck-on-the-ground/389629</link>
    <description>Most of the time when items are dropped on EasyRSC, they never disappear but just stick to the ground. You can&#39;t even pick them up after they&#39;re on the ground awhile either, so they&#39;re just stuck there until I reset the server. Is there a way to fix this?</description>

</aside>
<p>Try the way I told you, the server should remove the item from client when leaving the area, I noticed in RSC that when I pressed ‘climb down’ the items were removed before I actually climbed down.</p>
<p>When player drops item, leaves the area and comes back, server treats the client as it doesn’t know the item and sends the item info again, which it obviously shouldn’t. I’ll test it and tell you the results.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">			for(Item i : newItems) {
				byte[] offsets = DataConversions.getObjectPositionOffsets(i.getLocation(), playerToUpdate.getLocation());
				packet.addShort(i.getID());
				packet.addByte(offsets[0]);
				packet.addByte(offsets[1]);
			}</code></pre>
<p>So removing the items client-side when going to whole new area could fix it, or just do it serverside.</p>

<p>Anyway, does anyone know what causes items to become ‘bugged’ when going downstairs/upstairs? I haven’t seen anyone fix this properly yet and wondered if anyone actually knows why it happens.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This could work: The client should be notified to remove the item before moving the player “upstairs”, and when player re-enters the area, client should be notified to show the item.</p>
<p>If anybody wants to bother trying what I wrote above, post here, I’m interested if it works.</p>

<p>No, duping is not “technically” scamming. Scamming is fraud, duping is bug abuse.</p>

</aside>
<p>…</p>
<p>I made $1,400 from selling two hats for gp and then selling the gp to Tm218/Kib for their game gold website. In a matter of hours. For all I know, they had much more hats than what I estimated. Most people know Raggis made quite a lot of money from selling gp and hats.</p>

<p>You call it scamming, I call it making more real-life money from RSC than anyone else I can think of… At the end of the day, what does it take to become significant in a fucked up, dead community? I honestly couldn’t give a flying fuck if you consider me significant or not.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So you don’t care, yet you ask me how to become significant? That’s a little puzzling. I’m also puzzled at how you say things like this (I guess trying to justify scamming in your weird way?), and then complain that people are always hating on you.</p>

Asked him for advice about a server he ran with Lefty a long time ago and Reines told him his thoughts on what to do.</p>
<p>Just because he wont help someone as insignificant as you doesn’t mean he wont help.[/quote]<br>
I’m sure he has helped people in the past with general programming/design but he’s not interested in discussing RSC or the RSCD source code to anyone that asks him (except maybe a very good friend).</p>
<p>I knew Reines well on RSC, long term member of his numerous communities and we got on well, neither of us had a bad word to say about each other so I’m sure I have more hope that the majority but the fact is he’s simply not interested in talking about a project that got leaked without his permission. Plus, the project was a university project that he put together quickly with very little programming knowledge (compared to what he arguably knows now) several years ago.</p>
<p>I’ve never asked him for help on anything but I know if I had spent that much time on something I would be interested in how it’s turned out and what people are doing with my creation but he simply couldn’t care. I’ve seen numerous people attempt to contact him (arguably less insignificant than me) and they got the same reaction.</p>
<p>PS. I love the insignificant comment when I’ve been in the RSC community for years and years without ever hearing your name before or knowing who you are. If I’m insignificant I’d like to hear your description of most of the posters here.[/quote]</p>
<p>I almost tl;dr on this one. Keep it short next time.</p>
<p>He may not be interested, but that doesn’t matter. He’d still help if the problem is complex and worthy (and if you’re not some random person asking). It probably depends on his mood also. Doesn’t surprise me that those people got turned away. I have turned away a lot of people who have asked me about certain things. Again, it probably depends on his mood.</p>
<p>It’s funny, because I never heard of you until around late 09 I think, when your name came up on Wartnet about who was the biggest scammer.<br>
I’ve been around as long, if not longer. Who knows, who cares. The time spent online is irrelevant. You were known for scamming, that is it. It doesn’t get any less insignificant than that.</p>

              <p>Most of the time when items are dropped on EasyRSC, they never disappear but just stick to the ground. You can’t even pick them up after they’re on the ground awhile either, so they’re just stuck there until I reset the server. Is there a way to fix this?</p>
