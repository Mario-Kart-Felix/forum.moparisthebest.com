    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-combat-level-help-317/360193</link>
    <description>Hi there, I have 2 questions... First off, how can i make my maximum combat level 138 (Somewhere i read that i have to make another skill a combat skill). Secondly, I was curious about how i would make admins+ be able to have a higher combat level than normal players, If you [b]can[/b] help I will be very grateful!
PS: I have already tried changing the maximum skill level but i much prefer having a &quot;normal&quot; skill level as in 99 or 100.
Hope you can help!</description>
