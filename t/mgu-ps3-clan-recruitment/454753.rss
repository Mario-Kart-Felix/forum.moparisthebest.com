    <description>I took the time to make this so please take the time to read this.

To Apply simple visit the website: [url=http://mguclan.smffy.com]MGU Site[/url]
and register, then post under the applications thread. [B]!Follow the Layout![/B] or you can add me on PSN: R4inb0w_R4zR then when I add you I will message you with questions. [B]!MGU members must be registered on the site though, also you must register with your PSN![/B]

Now for my back story. I was in a clan called AFO Neptune, I was one of the first 10, we had a BF3 server and it was awesome, when I left (other day haha) we had around 45+, but yet few people were ever on and no one ever played the server so I was bored, I loved my clan members, they were all mature 18+(I am a mature 16 year old) So I enjoyed playing with them when I could, but I want to make a clan when we have active mature players that we can invite to a game or message and actually get a response from and not have to worry about &quot;noobs&quot; or just trolling idiots.

So please think about this amazing idea of a life time, the clan just started and I need members! 

Currently Until any of the new releases above are actually released, we will be playing:

COD: Black Ops
Battlefield 3

So please hit me up or if you just want to chill once again my PSN: R4inb0w_R4zR,
Alternatively you can add my skype, tikedesigns. 

Thank you.</description>
