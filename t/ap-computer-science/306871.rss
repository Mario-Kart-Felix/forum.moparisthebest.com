    <description>Hey, I&#39;m planning on taking AP Computer Science as a course in my senior year in high school, which is next year. I was wondering what the class teaches, it&#39;s difficulty, etc. If anyone could supply me with some information, that would be great.</description>

              <p>My school does not have any computer-related classes available in the curriculum, so i’m screwed over if I plan on learning anything about computer science at my school. Although i’m not fretting over it because self-teaching is the highest quality of learning in my opinion, as you experience successes and failures first-hand.</p>

              <p>I was in AP comp science in my junior year, I graduated this year… But like David said its mainly the basic’s with a few advanced settings such as learning how to build/fix a computer, and learning all the computer’s language and what the symbols mean, etc…</p>
<p>If you need anymore help just google AP computer science, and there are a few helpful sites.</p>
