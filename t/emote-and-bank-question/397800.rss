    <title>Emote and bank question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/emote-and-bank-question/397800</link>
    <description>I want to change the bank name, but in the client it just says this: [code]			if(rsInterface.type == 4 || rsInterface.type == 1) {
				rsInterface.centerText = stream.readUnsignedByte() == 1;
				int k2 = stream.readUnsignedByte();
				if(textDrawingAreas != null)
					rsInterface.textDrawingAreas = textDrawingAreas[k2];
				rsInterface.textShadow = stream.readUnsignedByte() == 1;
			}[/code]
Now i don&#39;t want to replace it with [code]        if(rsInterface.interfaceType == 4) {
            rsInterface.disabledMessage = stream.readString().replaceAll(&quot;RuneScape&quot;, &quot;Your servers name&quot;);
            rsInterface.enabledMessage = stream.readString();
         }[/code]
Because i&#39;m afraid ill mess everything up, If you could explain it to me and not spoon feed that would be lovely, also for the skill cape emote this is what is there, but i want to know how i can change it so that if you don&#39;t have a skillcape it just sends the other spirit instead of the one where you DO have it on. it was already there in the rsinterface file but it didn&#39;t work. here is all the code i have for the skillcape emote.
[code]addButton(154, 32, &quot;/Emotes/EMOTE&quot;, &quot;Skillcape Emote&quot;, 41, 47);[/code]
CHILD CODE FOR ALL SKILL CAPE EMOTES
[code]scroll.child(32, 154, 5, 401);[/code]

Thanks for all the help in advance  :cool:</description>

<p>Just comment out the text using ‘//’ and give it a shot. Oh, and for the skillcape emotes, you’re supposed to be looking in server. Probably in ‘ActionButtons.java’ if you’re using the basic PI / Delta source.</p>
