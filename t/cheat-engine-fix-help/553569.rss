    <title>Cheat Engine Fix? Help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cheat-engine-fix-help/553569</link>
    <description>Hey, I was wondering if it&#39;s possible to prevent someone from using cheat engine. Someone on my server logged in, got integers from the slayer tower&#39;s floor levels, and set hotkeys so he can teleport between floor levels, in other words height levels (even not at slayer tower) using cheat engine. Is there anyway possible I can block the use of cheat engine at all? I see tutorials on blocking cheat clients, but not cheat engine. Please help, thanks!</description>

You can never make your server 100% secure. There are always people finding ways to bypass security. All people do is just add extra layers of security in order to make the process of exploiting longer and harder, but not impossible.</p>
<p>Think of it like breaking into a house, you have a lock, a door, an alarm. But the thief can still break into the house, but the more things needed to break into, the longer and more effort is required to do so.<br>

Actually, as far as exploits like this go, it is entirely possible to make your server 100% secure.  You simply don’t trust the client in any instance ever without verifying it with the server, and this will prevent issues like the OP described from being possible, period.  If you simply mean stopping macros and/or other forms of third party clients is impossible, that’s true, and in that case, your statement is valid, but that has nothing to do with the OP.[/quote]</p>
<p>It is all relevant. The OP is asking for a fix regarding the use of Cheat Engine to exploit. However, even if the OP managed to fix this, there are still many ways in which you can manipulate the client and packets sent to the server etc.</p>
<p>Basically by fixing this problem, his server is still not going to be secure.</p>

              <p>Validate everything server sided and you wouldn’t have this problem.</p>
<p>There are ways to block it, but there are also ways to bypass the block, so as said above it’s kinda impossible.</p>
<p>Get the list of processes, scan through them, find the original file path, match the file executable’s bytes with a list of blocked executables or at least a pattern, then block accordingly. Might work, might not, there’s always a way around.</p>

<p>You <span class="bbcode-i">may</span> be able to prevent cheat client from working with your client (Which I highly doubt), but then another program (eventually if not already) will be able to do the same thing.</p>
<p>It’s a never ending battle, really. You develop an anti hack system, someone develops a new hack. Rinse and repeat.</p>
