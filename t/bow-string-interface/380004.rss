    <title>Bow string interface?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bow-string-interface/380004</link>
    <description>Hi, I was wondering if anyone could help me with creating a Stringing interface, that lets players right click and select &quot;String all&quot; or &quot;string 10&quot; etc... I am new to interfaces... But I always like to learn :P Plus lot of my players have suggested to add this into the server which I also agree it should be there... 

 I am using a 317 DELTA source. Thanks ahead of time.
