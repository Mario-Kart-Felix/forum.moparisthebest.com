    <title>Bigotry</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bigotry/3299</link>
    <description>First off, if you are not going to post something that is relevant to this topic in any way, shape, or form dont waste your time continuing on with it. This topic is going to be used to discuss bigotry and its effects, so dont go posting about how your cat died, or how you once got laid with a chicken. Because franky, the people who READ this topic wont give a shit.

That being said.....

I personally do not understand why bigots are ( for lack of better words ) like that. Just because someone is a little different is not grounds to hate them. Think about it, if everyone was a bigot, then everyone would hate everyone, and thats just stupid. Yes, you could say that I despise these people, and that I am prejudiced against them. But is it really so wrong to be prejudiced against the people that go out of their way to belittle members of the opposite gender, other religions, other races, other sexual orientations, etc.

I am entitled to my opinion, and you are entitled to yours.

Some might say that I am prejudiced against bigots.</description>

Jks…<br>
I do think It’s kinda pointless, but as Got_Shine said, its often just because people feel threatened by others - they are either either envious of them, or just plain scared.</p>

<p>Yeah, it is stupid, I agree. But not everyone <span class="bbcode-b">is</span> a bigot, and most bigots keep their opinions to themselves. You have a bigoted point of view against bigots, and you dislike them because they dislike others who are different than them. You dislike them, because they are different from you. As you say, everyone can have their opinion. So maybe this thread is pointless?</p>

<p>Yes, it is wrong. Well, more accurately, stupid. People hate other groups of people, it’s natural, hating bigots is a waste of time. Just love everyone &lt;3.</p>
<blockquote>I am entitled to my opinion, and you are entitled to yours.</blockquote>
<p>Yeah but yours is boring and the point of your thread=null.</p>
