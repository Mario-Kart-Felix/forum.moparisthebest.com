Welcome to America!<br>

Welcome to a bad area. He is right when he says the area is like 7mile. People die all the time just from driving in the wrong areas. I actually took a detour on 7mile in Detroit MI thanks to a Tomtom that went out the window that night on my way back from college. I have seen things exactly like this take place. My uncle was almost in his place before.</p>
<p>The welcome to America joke is far from true in something like this, especially for someone like me who knows the area. If <span class="bbcode-b">anybody</span>, even who you think is a friend, asks you to go to the bad area of a town that is already horrible. My aunt was killed by a drunk driver, the lady was on her 3rd DUI, suspended license, just got out on bail for the 3rd DUI. She drove away from the scene and just left. It is exactly as he says, after a situation like this it is <span class="bbcode-b">very</span> hard to even gain self-confidence and trust again. Please refrain from the ‘Welcome to America’ jokes as I can say much more about the UK area.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
This one touches me more as there is much I would have wished to even had the moment to say to my aunt. I guess its all about your experiences.<br>
