    <title>Need Help Fixing NPC NoCliping, iClairity Base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-fixing-npc-nocliping-iclairity-base/325199</link>
    <description>Hey, I need help because whenever a player attacks an NPC on the iclarity base and they teleport away, the NPC will walk like 100 miles until its finds them LOL. 

I want this fixed because I&#39;m going to add some bosses on my server and it would be fucked if they all followed players all around the server so please help me.

Ill rep++ for any help at all.</description>
