    <description>I have made a webclient but people can&#39;t connect on my No-ip

The webclient loads fine for people. I have made so many post&#39;s in the last few days and getting moaned at for it.

If someone actually helped me and told me the way to actually make it work i wouldn&#39;t be doing it..

They get the &#39;Error connecting to server&#39; message when they try login.

I have changed all the IP&#39;s in the client from 127.0.0.1 and i can&#39;t find a IP to change server Side..

Whats the problem please?</description>
