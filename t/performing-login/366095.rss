              <p>This happens to me sometimes too. The thing that happens to me is that my ip for my computer will change by 1 number. If your on xp just click run and type cmd, hit enter, in cmd prompt type ipconfig /all, there should be an ip with (recommended) beside it. That is what you will need in your portforward on your router. If your on vista or win 7, open up network and sharing center, click view status, details and a list of stuff should pop up. Something like this should pop up “IPv4 IP Address” then your computer ip should be to  the right of that, then just add it to your portforward on your router. Hope this is what you were needing.</p>
