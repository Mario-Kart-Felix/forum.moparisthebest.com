    <title>Would you change the combat system?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-you-change-the-combat-system/418616</link>
    <description>What do you not like about the RSC combat system? What is overpowered? Underpowered? Are there any major changes you would make to it?

I&#39;m pretty sure we can all agree that god spells are overpowered... Especially since you can hit 20+ at level 15.</description>

That’s what I’m doing because I feel the same way. For example, I made maces have really high strength + a prayer bonus but extremely inaccurate.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Rodgerwilco, post:2, topic:418693”]Flip the sprite of the ranger. So that the melee person is hitting them in the back. Add the bow if its not there. Does that sound right? Would look like shit imo.</p>
<p>^<br>
Just noticed me and cleako thought of the same thing.[/quote]<br>
Yeah sounds silly haha.</p>
<p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:1, topic:418693”]AttackHandler starts the RangeEvent (or at least it does on RSCE) and then it checks if they’re in combat each time it ranges. If they are, the RangeEvent is ended… or it might be when you’re attacked it checks to see if a RangeEvent is running and stops it. Either way, find out where it’s stopped and remove that check and it will continue ranging but as already said the sprites will need to be done to make it realistic. You would also need to adjust the combat so the person ranging doesn’t generate hits from the combat formula but instead through the range formula. How you’d go about handling it after your opponent runs is up to you, I presume it would just stop or automatically start ranging again when you’re allowed to re-attack?</p>
<p>Honestly, RSC wasn’t really designed for this and it seems tacky.[/quote]<br>
Yeah it probably would be tacky. I just wanna experiment. I’m just gonna delete the end range event like you said and not bother with a sprite for now…</p>
