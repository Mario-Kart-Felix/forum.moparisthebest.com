    <title>Good Computer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-computer/285294</link>
    <description>Well, I got a laptop that I&#39;m about to sell to my bro for $300 and I&#39;m about to have $100. So, I was just looking around for computers at newegg and found this one.

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883113094

I was wondering if it&#39;s a good computer to you guys. I have a 6 year old eMachine (ram and video card have been upgraded) and I was thinking that it&#39;s time for a new computer. I believe this is the best computer I&#39;m going to get for $400. I&#39;ve been wanting a Mac Book, But I won&#39;t have $1000 any time soon. So, what do you guys think about my situation. Also, If I build a computer with $400 could I get a better one?</description>

              <p>Heres a few resources that may tip you over the egde if your interested in building your own machine.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davesite.com/computers/system/checklist.shtml" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.davesite.com/computers/system/checklist.shtml</a> (old but the list is good).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pcmech.com/byopc/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.pcmech.com/byopc/</a> (pretty comprehensive from scratch guide)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.build-your-own-computers.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.build-your-own-computers.com/</a> (alternative to the above)</p>
<p>A couple of tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Be sure to check for compatibility between the specifics of your parts. For example, if your buying an IDE Cd or hard drive ensure your motherboard comes with IDE and Sata. If your CPU FSB(front side bus) is lower then your motherboards supported FSB then it will clock the cpu down to a slower fsb and cause potential system instability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Motherboard mounts are important. A motherboard mount is a small mount you put on top of the screw between the motherboard and the case. Not installing them before turning the computer on will usually give you a nice motherboard shaped frisbee.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I assume your going to use Newegg? One particularly good thing about newegg is how helpful they are when it comes to products arriving dead on arrival (god forbid).</p>
<p>Parts wise in the price range:</p>
<p>Cpu: Core 2 duo e5300 or e5400<br>
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116076&amp;Tpk=e5400" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116076&amp;Tpk=e5400</a></p>
<p>Motherboard: wide number of options, check for compatibility and such especially customer reviews.<br>
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=2010200280%204017%204802&amp;name=Top%20Sellers" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=2010200280%204017%204802&amp;name=Top%20Sellers</a></p>
<p>Ram: 2gb or 4gb ddr2 800<br>
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=2010170147%201052108080%201052416064&amp;name=DDR2%20800%20(PC2%206400)" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=2010170147%201052108080%201052416064&amp;name=DDR2%20800%20(PC2%206400)</a></p>
<p>The rest like case and power supply, video card, hard drive size, dvd burners etc etc provide alot of options for you to pick and choose from.</p>

<p>Lil Goon, you could build a pc slightly better than that for about the same price however I think for $400 that PC is a good deal. On the other hand I personally would spend another $50-100 on a pc with a Core 2 processor because they will be sufficient for every day tasks for longer than the Pentium Dual Core.</p>

<p>Oh, excuse me, I had no idea, thank you for informing me. If you haven’t noticed, he wants to see what he can get for $400.00, not just a Prebuilt. He’s interested in Building one as well. So obviously he’s not uncomfortable with the idea of building one. He’s just ignorant.</p>
<p>So, you can take that post of yours, and shove it right up <span class="bbcode-i">your</span> asshole.</p>
