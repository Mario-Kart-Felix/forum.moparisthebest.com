    <title>Gate Time Limit</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gate-time-limit/525948</link>
    <description>My server is a PI when you teleport to corp, you run through the mini corps and when you are outside the gate you click it to go inside, but someone found a bug if you click it several times means you warp in and out, you&#39;ll be in a different corp instead without the minions, and you can attack corp from outside, how do i add a time limit, like you can only enter and leave once per 10 seconds, would be really glad if somebody could help me!</description>

              <p>Just make a timer set to 10 every time a player clicks the gate. Then add an if statement in the case to see if the timer is &gt; 0.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
case #:
if (timer &gt; 0) {
sendMessage("You can only enter once every 10 seconds.");
return;
}

//rest of code
timer = 10;
break;</code></pre>
<p>Then just make it decrease in process.</p>
<p>Or use an event</p>
