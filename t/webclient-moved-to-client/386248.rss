    <title>Webclient moved to Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-moved-to-client/386248</link>
    <description>Okay, I deleted my files to my client a long time ago, but still had the webclient files.  I run Ubuntu Linux 11.04 now.  The thing is, when I changed everything to client. I put cache into the client as &quot;cache&quot;, and then I pointed all of the things that said &quot;C:/.MYSERVER&quot; and changed it to &quot;./cache,&quot; it loaded up but a lot of the images didn&#39;t show up.  Any help please?
[b]EDIT[/b]: This is 317 Delta Non-renamed.  If you need to see my client files, I can show &#39;em.</description>
