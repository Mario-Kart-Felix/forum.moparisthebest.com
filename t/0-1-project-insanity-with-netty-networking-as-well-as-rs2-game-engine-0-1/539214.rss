    <description>[center]Project Insanity With Netty Networking
Well i wanted to work with a netty PI and move my way up to runesource or hyperion in the near future so this will probably be the last project insanity that i work with.  I still have a lot to learn but it is still a good learning purpose for me.  The content will constantly be updated starting from 0.1 and moving up i will most likely finish this off at maybe a 2.0 or a 3.0 i&#39;m not very sure yet.  Imo it is a lot better then the regular project insanity but we all have our reasons why it is or why it is not.  Most people will agree that netty networking on project insanity is better though.  I hope that you can do something with this before or after i am done it&#39;s up to you.  I do not have a project thread for this because i do not need it.  The last verison will not be released as i will be putting more time and effort into it and buying paid advertisements in the near future.  It won&#39;t be right away because i do not rush development but you catch my drift.  Well hope you enjoy and have fun :cool:
