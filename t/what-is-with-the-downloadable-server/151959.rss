Now to the good (or for my case bad :() part when ever I try to run moparscape (I have it fully downloaded, fully extracted and in its own folder) it does pop up, but then it just loads up to an average of 5% every time, and then exits out. I dont know what is happening, and I REALLY want to play moparscape! I know its not an error so if anybody can PLEASE help me I would REALLY appreciate it. thank you! oh, and when I try to run the online servers it shows the java symbol then turns all greyish-white with a little x on a piece of parchment up at the top-left corner. I dont know whether its a problem with my computer or the program its self  :confused: so PLEASE people im BEGGING you PLEASE help me if you can!
