    <title>Help with multiple things</title>

    <description>Hey, I need help with three things. (Thought I would make one post instead of three separate posts.)

1. A lottery/gambling method through an NPC
2. Ring of Wealth in which it would increase drop rates while the ring is worn.
3. An automated server message which will go off every hour or so, telling whoever is online to register on forums, vote, etc.

These would all be added to a 317 Delta server, if it can&#39;t be done, let me know. If anyone can post the codes and which .Java file the codes belong in, I would love that, thank you all.</description>

              <p>For the lottery gambling in the npc, use a Misc.random generator for it, I’m not used to Delta, so I don’t know the methods for dialogues for it, but if you’re a fairly decent coder you can just make a dialogue for it to take your money, and you do a Misc.random for it to be either a win or a loss, if it’s a loss then it will just end, if it’s a win it will open a new dialogue that gives you your money or something, if you were talking about Runesource I could do it for you, but you should still learn everything about Delta.</p>
