What&#39;s up with it or is it just me?

I&#39;ve been at hill giants for about a week now, 30 minutes a day or so. I get people calling me names, i don&#39;t really care, i just report them so maybe one day they will unmute me lol. So in the span of a week, i reported more than a dozen players, still no response from them? Usually when i report someone and the evidence is overwhelming OR right there in their face, like the case above, they respond like in 2 days or so.

I&#39;ve been sending them messages through the message centre. They said if i keep sending them messages, they will block my messages? I stopped sending them messages after that. 

Is it possible they blocked me? But abuse reports are different aren&#39;t they? 

Perform an experiment if you don&#39;t mind. Go to F2P, some world anyone you want(F2P). And go to the hill giants and that range corner, start taking all the giants, like i do, take 2 at the same time. They will get mad and curse at you, report them, and tell me if the following days if they actually tell you(JaGex), &quot;we have taken action against this person, blah blah blah.&quot;

Btw F2P people are so immature. No offense, but most of them are.</description>

A shitty crown?[/quote]</p>
<p>UNMUTENESS.</p>
<p>Screw the crown.</p>
<p>Do you know how hard it is to buy a single item without talking? You have to wait for a person to say selling so and so item. it gets really really annoying! I don’t look for the crown, just being able to talk again would be enough.</p>
