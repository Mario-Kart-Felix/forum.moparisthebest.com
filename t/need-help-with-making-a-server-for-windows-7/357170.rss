    <title>Need help with making a server (for Windows 7)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-making-a-server-for-windows-7/357170</link>
    <description>Well, so far i have YET to find a topic on how to make a server, just for Windows 7. I&#39;m having troubles on connecting me to my server, even when the IP is on 0.0.0.0.

So.. does anyone have a link to a topic about it JUST for Windows 7?

If not, can you tell me how to please? :[</description>
