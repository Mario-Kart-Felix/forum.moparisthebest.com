    <description>So i have been coding a source for a while now.I have added most basic things. I need a coding partner who can code things like cw,change log in tab,make a place wildy,auto donation (we will do one thing at the time). When i am done with the source i am going to host it on a vps and buy domains. I am planning to host it forever.

              <p>ok for starters, yes you are a first time poster its kind of hard to put all ur time and faith into a first time poster. secondly you need to atleast provide some info about the source your coding.</p>
<p>-eco/spawn?<br>
-revision?<br>
-pics/media?<br>
developers application?</p>
<p>so much more that u need ^ was just a little bit of a example of some sort of layout <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>i suggest remaking this post and actually put some effort into it that way it will show people your not just some little noob posting about nothing trying to hack n stuff. hope you take my information into consideration.</p>
