    <title>[Development] Polix - Java based RPG</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/development-polix-java-based-rpg/478986</link>
    <description>[img]http://polix.site50.net/img/logo.png[/img]Polix will be a game very much like runescape 2006, there will be different graphics (custom) and some other differences throughout the game, so Jagex wont be able to shut it down. Yes it will take a lot of time to code, but I&#39;m teaming up and the website is already being coded as we speak.

Updates will be posted here as well as the temporary website: [url=http://polix.site50.net]here.[/url]

I don’t really see why this should be posted here if the main focus of it is a game written in Java. I suggest general programming rather than website development. I understand that part of this is the actual website, but without any code to see we can’t properly critique your work.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Because this post is for solely the WEBSITE development. I was just simply giving information about the site, so people don’t ask questions like what’s this for, etc.[/quote]<br>
Okay, so now there’s a few issues.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have you had your site link verified before posting it here? If not, private message a moderator and they’ll review it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What else do you plan to add to the website? I don’t see a proposed idea list etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we get any further information about what this whole development is actually around?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I also stand by my previous point, if you don’t provide us with any actual code I can’t properly give you any pointers on the website.</p>
