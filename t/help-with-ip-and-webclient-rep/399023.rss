              <p>To change the IP open up your Client folder and open up EGUI or GUI and search for the current IP or hit CTRL - F and search for “IP”, “corruptionx”, “no-ip”, “.org”, or “localhost”.</p>
<p>And honestly I wouldn’t want to be on someones server that doesn’t know how to change the IP on the Client and Source they just downloaded and are now trying to get people to play. Doing 10 minutes of coding doesn’t make it your own server, either. And you can’t rep people btw, so no point trying.</p>
