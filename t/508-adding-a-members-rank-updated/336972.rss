    <title>[508] Adding a Members Rank [Updated]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-adding-a-members-rank-updated/336972</link>
    <description>[b]Introduction:[/b] This is farily easy, and can be used very greatly in your server. This is very similar to a Donator&#39;s Rank, but don&#39;t get confused between the both.

[b]Difficulty:[/b] 2/10
[b]Requirements:[/b] Basic Knowledge of Java, and a 508 Server.
[b]Description:[/b] This will create a Membership System on your server. (I&#39;ll include some examples and a commnd)
[b]Chapters:[/b] 4


[size=14pt]Chapter One: Creating the Membership:[/size]

For this chapter, you will be setting up the Membership into your server. 

[b]1.[/b] Go to [b]Player.Java[/b] and add these lines of code somewhere:

[code]public int MemberShip = 0;
public int MemberShipTimer = -1
public int MemberProcessFix = 0;[/code]

What does this do, you may ask? Well, this simply creates an Integer Variable that will store the Days of membership a player will have. The &#39;0&#39; is the amount of the days the user will have by default, but it can be changed.

[b]2.[/b] Press [b]Ctrl + F[/b] and search for: [b]process() {[/b] and add this code:

[code]	if (MemberShipTimer &gt; 0) {
	    MemberShipTimer--;
	} else
	if (MemberShipTimer == 0) {
	    MemberShipTimer = -1;
	if (MemberProcessFix &lt; 1) {
	    MemberShip -= 1;
	    MemberProcessFix = 1;
	}
	}[/code]

This code will be constantly checked in the Player&#39;s Process. It will check, that if the Player&#39;s Member Timer is higher than 0, it will decrease every so on creating a timer. 
Now we are done with this chapter. 

[size=14pt]Chapter Two: Making the Membership Savable, and Login stuff:[/size]

[b]1.[/b] Go to [b]FileManager.Java[/b] and search for: [b]public void saveCharacter[/b] and add this somewhere: (With little knowledge, you will know where and where not to put it):

[code]stream.writeString(&quot;MemberShip:&quot; + p.MemberShip);
stream.writeString(&quot;MemberShipTimer:&quot; + p.MemberShipTimer);[/code]

[b]2.[/b] Now search for: [b]loadCharacter[/b] and add this somewhere:

[code]                } else if (line.startsWith(&quot;MemberShip:&quot;)) {
                    p.MemberShip = Integer.parseInt(line.substring(11));
                } else if (line.startsWith(&quot;MembershipTimer:&quot;)) {
                    p.HayFind = Integer.parseInt(line.substring(16));[/code]

These codes will both save the Membership Data into the Player&#39;s Account, and will load it upon each login. Now for the Login Part.

[b]3.[/b] Go to [b]Frames.Java[/b] and search for: [b]378, 93[/b] and you will find two strings that are set to [b]378, 94[/b] and [b]378, 93[/b]. If you know what strings are, erase those strings and replace them by this:

[code]        if (p.MemberShip &gt; 0) {
        setString(p, &quot;&quot; +p.MemberShip+ &quot; days of member credit&quot;, 378, 94);
        setString(p, &quot;You have &quot; + p.MemberShip + &quot; days of member credit remaining. Please click here to extend your credit&quot;, 378, 93);[/code]

Please make sure that you don&#39;t have any other [b]Strings[/b] set with &#39;[b]378, 94[/b] [u]or[/u] [b]378, 93[/b]. If you do, erase them and replace them by this. If you don&#39;t those strings will overwrite these ones, and will not show up correctly as having membership.
Now what does this do, you may ask? This just simply says how Much Membership Days you have, in the member box upon login. Nothing Special.

[b]4. (Optional)[/b] This will add a Custom Login, saying that &#39;Server Member Bob has logged in. Blah blah blah&#39;, if you want to add something like this, go to [b]Login.Java[/b], and add this:

[code]		if (p.rights == 0 &amp;&amp; p.MemberShip &gt;= 1) {
		p.frames.sendMessage(pz, &quot;&lt;col=FF6611&gt;Server Member &quot;+Misc.optimizeText(p.username) + &quot; has logged in. There are now &quot;+ Engine.getPlayerCount()+&quot; players online.&quot; );
                }[/code]

This just simply says whenever a Member has logged in for the whole server too see. It&#39;s only optional to add.


[size=14pt]Chapter Three: Making Commands, etc[/size]

This chapter will allow you to have a chance to create a command for [b]giving[/b] membership to another player. Go to [b]Commands.Java[/b], and add this:

[code]else if (cmd[0].equals(&quot;givemembership&quot;) &amp;&amp; p.rights &gt; 1) { //Change 1 to 0 if you want to allow mods to use this Command.
String person = playerCommand.substring((playerCommand.indexOf(&quot; &quot;) + 1));
Player p2 = Engine.players[Engine.getIdFromName(person)];
if (p2 != null) {
p2.MemberShip = 31; //Change this to the Amount of Membership you want to give.
p.frames.sendMessage(p, &quot;You have successfully given: &lt;col=000088&gt;&quot; +p2.username+ &quot;&lt;/col&gt; Membership.&quot;);
p2.frames.sendMessage(p2, &quot;You have been granted &lt;col=000088&gt;31&lt;/col&gt; days of Membership by &lt;col=000088&gt;&quot; +p.username+ &quot;.&quot;);
p2.updateReq = true;
p2.appearanceUpdateReq = true;
p2.frames.logout(p2);
}
}[/code]

To use this command, for example, type &#39;[b]::GiveMemberShip QuestMaster2K10[/b]&#39; And it will give the player with the Username of QuestMaster2K10 membership. Change the 31 in:

[code]p2.MemberShip = 31; //Change this to the Amount of Membership you want to give.[/code]

to whatever amount you want to give the other Player.


[size=14pt]Chapter Four: Miscellaneous:[/size]

This tutorial was meant for beginner purposes only. This could be very useful for growing servers. I&#39;m sorry if it didn&#39;t reach up to your expectations. Have any advice or tips on me creating other tutorials? PM or Post, i&#39;ll be glad to make another.

[b]1.[/b] To make something only be usable for Members, example, Add this Command:

[code]else if (cmd[0].equals(&quot;membertest&quot;)) {
if (p.MemberShip &lt; 1) {
p.frames.sendMessage(p, &quot;Only members of RuneScape are allowed to use this command.&quot;);
return;
} else
if (p.MemberShip &gt; 0) {
p.frames.sendMessage(p, &quot;Gratz! ur a member!&quot;);
}
}[/code]

This will create a example command, usable by typing [b]&#39;::MemberTest&#39;[/b]. It will show you the differences of how the code will work for members and non members.

[b]Save and Compile, and then restart your server. This will not cause any errors unless you do not do it right. Good luck, and post if you need help.[/b]</description>
