    <description>Didn&#39;t feel like making a video so I am just posting a couple of gifs:D. Just something I have been working on for the server. this will be the only place to wc Mage logs and I am going to have the evil trees be a bit hard to kill and they will drop heaps of logs to and possibly a ring that will make them not aggressive. I think I am going to take a few of them out though because theres just to many in such a small area. criticism, opinions, and any thoughts of neat changes are welcome.

              <p>Yes people will utilize the tutorials. You have to remember that you didn’t create the software being used, you simply got it working past what others have even attempted - the software is available for others to download and edit themselves. You could at least recognize yourself by releasing it before others do and your work seems irrelevant anyway. You’re trying to sell in a market that doesn’t really exist.</p>
<p>As Scully said, tools to edit maps are very limited. I think it’s better in the long run to help the community over helping yourself in this case. Most of the people viewing are probably wishing you’d just release your fix for RuneBeam’s as well as the object editor. There’s really nothing preventing you from releasing either of the two except your want for personal gain off of these tools.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to sound like a jerk, sorry if I come off that way.</p>

<p>That’s entirely up to you, your edits are your work. It’s likely that eventually someone will figure out both tools if the demand is high enough before people decide to pay real money for RSPS tools. I know you have a mindset of profiting from these tools, but I don’t see that business being very high, especially in a site that prohibits sales. You were offering a service to encourage creativity in servers, but why must people pay if you yourself want to see creativity improve?</p>
<p>A tool like this would be great as an open source project. The community obviously is interested but not willing to pay, which makes sense. The release of the tool otherwise is completely up to you, my point is that if your withholding of the tools is due to profit-seeking, you’re likely looking in the wrong areas.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I forgot that buying and selling is prohibited her i think it is allowed on rserv right. but the point i was coming from is like if I am going to spend multiple days making a huge map of course I am going to want some sort of reward etc for my time and effort ya know, but if its something simple then yea free of course. but idk we’ll see what happens i guess. I used to preach uniqueness to servers im gunna work on some tutorials I just dont know if anyone is going to utilize the tutorials like do you think itd be worth my time?[/quote]</p>
<p>It would be nice considering that we’ve got practically no fully functioning tools for map editing that are available. After this semester of school I might work on one, but I’m not too sure.</p>

<p>The last time I had fooled with this I had fixed that error but came across another error where it couldn’t find 0.png. So probably needs some fine tuning with a build path or something. The files are in the paths the compiler throws, so it’s not actually missing any files. If anyone wants to mess around with this more, I could make a new thread for discussion. It’s obviously gaining interest, and the community hasn’t seen a working mapeditor since Peter’s basically. It’s something that’s always popular but never looked into. Not sure why.[/quote]</p>
<p>It says there “asset not found” it’s an easy fix. I’ll see what I did later I’ve just been so busy between work and my project I’m working on</p>

<p>The only other one I had found was Harry’s, but he stated somewhere that he was taking it to his grave. That was in 2011 though. Other than that, I haven’t seen more than the current three.</p>
<p>I just downloaded RuneBeam’s and threw it back in Eclipse. He uses Nifty which I will need to read up on, but I believe it’s just location issues or something.</p>

<p>The last time I had fooled with this I had fixed that error but came across another error where it couldn’t find 0.png. So probably needs some fine tuning with a build path or something. The files are in the paths the compiler throws, so it’s not actually missing any files. If anyone wants to mess around with this more, I could make a new thread for discussion. It’s obviously gaining interest, and the community hasn’t seen a working mapeditor since Peter’s basically. It’s something that’s always popular but never looked into. Not sure why.</p>

<p>It probably isn’t what you’re looking for, but because most mirrors are dead and people keep asking for some type of editor, I’ll upload it anyway; I have Peter’s mapeditor with Oxygen’s edit to load 377 cache. I had asked hadlich as well because I had some areas I needed a mapeditor for when changing my cache, but he wouldn’t budge in fear of losing his showoff spotlight and potential to make money. So I dug through an old desktop that I used when I started rsps and found it to accomplish what I needed it for. You’ll need to add a cache.</p>

</a><br>
RuneBeam’s shouldn’t be too difficult to get working but I was having issues with dependencies when I was trying to run it through Eclipse. I didn’t need the mapeditor for a large project so I gave up on it, but I’m sure it’s relatively easy to figure out. I can give it another shot. If anyone else fixes it, you should upload it for use.<br>
Here’s the link to the thread with the source code link: <a href="http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/tools/568699-rs-map-tool-source.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/tools/568699-rs-map-tool-source.html</a></p>
<p>We could probably work through mige’s too. Someone else would have to buy the copy though and upload it.</p>
