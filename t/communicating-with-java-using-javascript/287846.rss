    <title>Communicating with Java using JavaScript</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/communicating-with-java-using-javascript/287846</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;The usual means of communicating between a web page and an applet is by means of the applet&#39;s parameters. Although these form part of the document, they do not seem to be accessible to JS and so additional public methods for the applet must be provided to set variables which require to be changed by JS programs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Okay, there are many ways to do this, for example reloading an applet with JavaScript:

&lt;blockquote&gt;document.applet_html_name.init()&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The init() function is called only once and is named so because init is an abbreviation of the word initialize or initialisation, which also means to start or begin something. I would use the above example like this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;button onclick=&quot;document.applet_html_name.init();&quot; value=&quot;Reload Webclient&quot;&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I never actually thought the &#39;init()&#39; function in an applet could be called directly from JavaScript but there you go, they are not all that different.

I know this isn&#39;t really a tutorial, and it&#39;s not supposed to be, the purpose of this thread is to teach people about communication between Java applets and JavaScript.
