    <description>[code]if (newNPC.npcType == ###) {
         if ((newNPC.absX == ####) &amp;&amp; (newNPC.absY == ####)) {
            newNPC.TurnNpcTo(newNPC.absX -1, newNPC.absY);
	 }
      }[/code]

im using this code to make npc&#39;s face the direction i want them to.

if i tele away or log out they turn to face south again, the only way to get them facing the way i want them to again is to re-compile the server. 

i would like to be able to have them facing the direction i want them to be facing at all times &gt;.&gt; and not turn back to south when i leave that area. 

also, iv been told, when i can see them facing lets say east, other people on the server have said there facing south.

any help would be much appreciated &gt;.&lt; thanks</description>
