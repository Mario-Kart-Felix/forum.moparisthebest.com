    <title>Item On Item. Errors</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/item-on-item-errors/181619</link>
    <description>Mkay.. Im not brilliant with Item on Item or Item on Object coding.. I can make it work though, but its not something i can just get right within the first 20 times lol.
Anyway... i was reading through a tut on Item on Item, and attempted it.. I did exactly as the tut said, and ended up with this code:

[code]}
		else if(useItemID == 985 &amp;&amp; atItemID == 987) {
		deleteItem(985, getItemSlot(989), 1);
		deleteItem(987);
		sendMessage(&quot;You add the two pieces together and get a nice bonus.&quot;);
}[/code]
As a newb.. I know theres something wrong with the deleteItem(987) bit. The Idea was that you add the crystal key pieces together to form the full crystal key. I get errors from what&#39;re usually problems with the &quot;atItemID&quot; or &quot;atObjectID&quot; in particular, and could do with a bit of help as for if theres anything wrong with them, but the errors i got in this case were:

[code]client.java:16540:cannot find symbol
symbol : variable atItemID
location: class client
             else if(useItemID == 985 &amp;&amp; **a**tItemID == 987) {

client.java:16542: deleteItem(int,int,int) in client cannot be applied to (int) 
                **d**eleteItem(987);  [/code]

The places where the arrows are pointing to showing which are causing the errors somehow are inbetween the &quot;**&quot;s.. Im not that stupid ;)
Thanks ,
