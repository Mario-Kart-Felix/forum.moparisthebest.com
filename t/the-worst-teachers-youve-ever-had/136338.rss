    <title>The worst teachers you&#39;ve ever had</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-worst-teachers-youve-ever-had/136338</link>
    <description>Imagine this, your only just going into 6th grade, its your first time switching classes right? It&#39;s supposed to be fun with light streaming through the window, theres fun little math assignments to do, so your walking to your classroom everything seems normal, you open the door, it resembles a dark, dank, and dusty jail cell, with an UGLY teacher, that sais things like &quot;holy talito that&#39;s licaty split on a ham&#39;s head&quot;, or &quot;goose chase within a leg of a bear!&quot;,(those are just examples of my math teacher). She has a thing she hangs around her neck that enhances what she sais into a loud speaker all around the room.

Good thing that was only my math teacher, and i could just say,&quot; well math 87 is to hard, can i go to the at level math book, with a different teacher?&quot;, and they say (have to say),&quot; yes&quot;.

So it&#39;s all pretty good now, my homeroom teacher teaches my math to so i don&#39;t even have to change classes.</description>

              <p>Lawl. I’m in 9th now. My 6th grade math teacher… Well… I’m glad he didn’t make it for more than a year… His name was Mr. Johnson. He slapped girls on the ass for doing there homework (why he was fired). If we didn’t do his homework we couldn’t get more than a 54 F in that class. He said homework was his only feeling, that we 6th graders broke all the rest of them. It was hellx7</p>

              <p>Having a teacher that you don’t get on with will fuck up your grades. Last year i was predicted A* for my maths gcse, was in top set with the most lovliest teacher.</p>
<p>This year im predicted a D because of the dumb maths teacher i have had. Well 3 actually, i managed to get all 3 fired. Although this past year i’ve had the most wonderful english teacher and my grades have gone from a D to a B in english.</p>
<p>Just shows that it mostly depends on what teachers you have if you do well.</p>

              <p>Having assholes for teachers is probably the only part of the education system that makes sense. Screw algebra, nothing teaches you better for the real world then a real prick.</p>
<p>Of course, I’ve had my share of asshole teachers too. Mainly my english and media study teacher last year. I have alopecia areata which is a condition where your immune system basically attacks your hair follicles causing it to fall out. Normally I have a full head of hair, but once a year or so it’ll act up for about a month and then go away. I’ll have little bald patches. So for this, I wear a hat.</p>
<p>For some reason my mom insists that all my teachers know about it, dunno why. So of course right when I go to his class for the first time he introduces a new rule. No hats. Ok not that big of a problem since It was on the back of my head and I was at the very back of the class(along with many others…). “Nope, Don’t like the seating plan. Jamie move up front please.” And I was the only one that got moved. So here I am, sitting there embarrased as hell as everyone can see my bald spots. And I know he did this on purpose. He hates me and no one else. My mom probably pissed him off somehow. Well luckily I think I found the cause of the alopecia and it should stop forever now.</p>

              <p>The school I attended for 9th grade didn’t require for us to take an “Integrated Science” class, so I would selected to take Biology 1. Now I’m a sophmore going to a new school. And since this new school requires that all students take an “Integrated Science” class, I’m stuck in an all freshman class. Talk about a bummer. The only good thing about it is that i can hook up with all the hot, easy freshman girls that are in my science class. Freshman girls love having a boyfriend in a higher grade, which is good for me. I can teach all of them alot about “human anatomy” if you know what I mean. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=6" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>

              <p>Imagine this, your only just going into 6th grade, its your first time switching classes right? It’s supposed to be fun with light streaming through the window, theres fun little math assignments to do, so your walking to your classroom everything seems normal, you open the door, it resembles a dark, dank, and dusty jail cell, with an UGLY teacher, that sais things like “holy talito that’s licaty split on a ham’s head”, or “goose chase within a leg of a bear!”,(those are just examples of my math teacher). She has a thing she hangs around her neck that enhances what she sais into a loud speaker all around the room.</p>
<p>Good thing that was only my math teacher, and i could just say," well math 87 is to hard, can i go to the at level math book, with a different teacher?", and they say (have to say)," yes".</p>
<p>So it’s all pretty good now, my homeroom teacher teaches my math to so i don’t even have to change classes.</p>
