    <description>[center]Hi, I&#39;m currently working on a server by myself, the devolpment thread can be found here: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,414648.0.html
This thread is for the actual devolpment for the server, to show you what I&#39;ve got added and a few sneak peaks to the server. 

This is the suggestions thread for the project, I want to see what players are looking for in a server, so I can possibly add it to mine. So please, tell me what you guys look for in a server. 

Here are somethings not to suggest:
Construction
Summoning
High exp rates, example: 1000 (Will take lower though)


[u]These will never be added to my server[/u]


Suggestions that will be added:
None so far, get to suggesting!
