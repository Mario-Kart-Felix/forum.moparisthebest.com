    <title>Correct 3-dimensional movement</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/correct-3-dimensional-movement/465654</link>
    <description>I&#39;m working on a basic cube game (not really a game, more a learning experience) in OpenGL (using the LWJGL) and I was hoping someone can help me get the movement correct. You can see my code here:
http://pastebin.com/gaTtUkDn
I have forwards and backwards movement working, yet when I rotate the cube I no longer walk &quot;forwards&quot;. I know that this is not a bug, as it is what it&#39;s meant to do, but I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction :)

Thanks</description>

              <p>So, what you’re saying is that you want the cube to move on an angle when you turn it, right?</p>
<p>If so, when the player presses forward, you add a vector to your location with the following x and y:<br>
(cos(cubeRot), sin(cubeRot))<br>
For walking backwards, you take the same vector and multiply it by -1.</p>
