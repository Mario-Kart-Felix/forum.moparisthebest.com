    <description>(I honestly have no idea which section I am supposed to post this in, but this is a question, so I posted it here!)

[size=15pt]AGAIN, THIS IS FOR SLOMISCAPE USERS! DONT POST UNLESS YOU ARE A PART OF MY SERVER!, OR IF YOU DONT HAVE SOMETHING VALUABLE TO SAY![/size]

I have had numerous complaints because my server has a lack of commands and functions.

I have started this thread so all those complainers can get my attention!

Post any suggestions you may have, but keep in mind the following points:

1. I WILL NOT add free item commands. I may add commands that require money to use, but that&#39;s a separate argument

2. Currently, Im having problems with -fedexer-&#39;s global object adder; I get this error that says that it has already been stated, but it hasn&#39;t, so Im working on it :p.

3. Keep the just of point 1 in mind always. I have experienced  this in other servers: servers that have free item commands are filled with rich people who used very little effort to get to where the are.

(Sorry if this thread screams &quot;LOCK ME!&quot;, but I&#39;ve had enough whining, so here it is...[br][size=1]Posted on: April 24, 2007, 05:32:00 PM[/size][hr]No one? Comon, theres more whinners than this :P</description>

              <p>Moderator’s don’t really veiw this section tbh.  I’m only suggesting you move it there because I think you’ll get a better response…  Also, don’t limit suggestions to people who play you’re server.  Just say <span class="bbcode-b">all</span> suggestions are welcomed.   :rolleyes:</p>
