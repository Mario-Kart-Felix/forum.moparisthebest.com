    <title>Photoshop problem (Not sure where to put -.-)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/photoshop-problem-not-sure-where-to-put/14139</link>
    <description>Well Eather this is post to be in here or the graphics section... but this was logical so ill leave it here.

Well everything works great with my photoshop CS2 except my text tool that just loves getting f**ked up. Anyways All it does is when I type with say a size of 72 pts. it shows up like a text size of maybe .72pts, anyways right now im typeing at 1296 wich is the max it will go and its still small (about the size of this text which im guessing is around 12pts.) I think that maybe its tricking the program it self into thinking that im typeing a decimal number. Anyways Im just wondering what I should do, I have reset the tools and that does nothing.

If you kno how to fix this post =D


Thanks, MoO</description>

              <p>This happened to me alot. All you have to do is go to options or something and change the hard-drives it can cache to. You obviously only have 1 hard-drive.<br>
When you find the caching setting, make it so it also caches to C:\</p>
