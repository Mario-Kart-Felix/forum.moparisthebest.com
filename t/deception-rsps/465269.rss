    <description>Hey guys, I am Adam and i am here to talk about a very cool server. We are trying to gain a little more people than we have currently playing (not many). Please Help us out by visiting the Server and giving out Comments on what you like or what could be added to make the server better. We are currently still adding more stuff to the server like God Wars Dungeon and other cool things, but we do have lots of other things available to do while Cameron (the owner) is coding those. Cameron takes a lot of time coding the server to make it better, ad more interesting for players. We also have other owners that help out on the server, (Justin and Aaron). Our Administrator is Cody. And our Moderators as i know of are Rex, Soletsgo, and Kanima. I am currently a Donator (Adam). I think it is really great to play on this server. Please i hope to see you all in the future as you may consider coming on and saying hi.

                                     Thanks for reading and Considering,
