    <description>Hey guys, my server i&#39;ve been coding for about 5 month&#39;s just like...Fuckin&#39; died..It goes up and says i forgot like lost socket and Shit like that but anyway i wanna start from a blank source BUT NOT COMPLETELY. i want maybe one Talking npc one command so i can copy and paste it in the right spot because with the other blank source when i added commands it would give me 100 errors.

          -Though it is against the rules to giv3e out rep i am willing to do it because i&#39;m in desperate need.If you have something bad to say...don&#39;t say it cuz i&#39;m in a shitty mood....unless you&#39;re a mod.Thanks.</description>
