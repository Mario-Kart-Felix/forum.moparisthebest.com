    <description>i may be new here, i may have a small attention span, and i may have never read the rules (please forgive me) but i know with common sense that there are no rules that say i can make a topic on how to find a great server. I know i can just look on the advertisment board, but i have looked there, and there arent any good servers that stay up to date, 24/7 and doesnt suck. im not saying any server sucks, (believe me, ive tried to make a server and it sucked) im just saying i need a server thats legendary, uptight, and can control stupid massers and spamers. 

some people may think that im not asking for a good server, but just writting a stupid long paragraph thats gonna get spam and locked. but i hope it doesnt. i hope u people will understand that this topic is only about finding a good server and not other things like that stupid google crap or aliens in packeges. so what im trying to say is please dont fill my topic with crap and spam, but with the things i want, like a good server, thats all im asking for. Thank you.</description>
