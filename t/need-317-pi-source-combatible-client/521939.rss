    <title>Need 317 [pi] source &amp; combatible client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-317-pi-source-combatible-client/521939</link>
    <description>I require a 317 project insanity source, &amp; a combatible client, I intend using these as a base for a future project, I&#39;m somewhat fluent with java, I&#39;m best with project insanity which Is why I ask, it doesn&#39;t have to have fixed dupes, it can, but it&#39;s not important to me. Can anyone help ? I&#39;ve searches hours &amp; tested many sources &amp; clients, either they didn&#39;t work properly as intended, or were complete rips, basically BLANK.</description>
