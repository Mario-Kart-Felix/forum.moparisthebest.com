    <description>[quote=&quot; msn.com&quot;]A council internet forum has been closed after a link to a pornography website was added.
Worcestershire County Council said its Healthy Eating Forum, which enabled users to discuss healthy food and lifestyles, had been abused by &quot;childish individuals&quot;.
The council said such behaviour would not be tolerated.
Councillor Stephen Clee, Cabinet member for corporate services at Worcestershire County Council, said: &quot;The Healthy Eating Forum was set up to encourage discussions around attitudes to food and healthy lifestyles.
&quot;As is sometimes the case, immature and childish individuals have chosen to abuse the facility.
&quot;We will not tolerate this sort of abuse of our systems and have closed down the forum.
&quot;If and when the forum reopens, we will have to ensure a different regime is in place to protect users of the facility, and thwart those intent on mischief.&quot;[/quote]
