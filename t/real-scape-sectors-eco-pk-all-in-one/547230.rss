[b]I have remade Real-Scape tons of times sense 2008. I just started new development work on this server. We have been working on this for the past few days. We are going to call this Real-Scape Sectors, due to the fact that this is like two servers in one. I know you see the eco/spawn servers. But this is different, because you choose a path of either PK or ECO. If your PK your home is in Edgeville, you can spawn, level with command, etc. If your ECO your home is in Yanille and like a normal Eco server well you level and get your items to correct way. PK players cannot trade ECO players. This was an idea in my head for a while now and I finally got it into a server.[/b]

We are currently in BETA, and decided to post this to see if anyone is interested in BETA. If you want to join in on BETA, you can contact me via PM. We are also looking for more to join our Development Team, if your interested you can PM me.

<p>Thanks for pointing that out, I have been fixing every way possible for them two not to trade items. Because I am trying to keep the ECO. There is always two types of players, pkers and the economy guys. So I want to make this enjoyable for both. And keep it so both types of players can still interact.</p>

<p>+1 for emphasizing BETA being about finding glitches and issues, and not just being a pre-release for players.</p>
