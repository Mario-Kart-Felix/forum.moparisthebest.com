    <description>hello everyone , i would like to start off by introducing my self first , my name is Omar and i&#39;m from Iraq so please don&#39;t start fights with me in the comments about my english xD
ok so ill start off with few questions
Q1) What is PI, i know PI = Project Insanity , but what does it REALLY MEAN?..
Q2) When i try to edit the codes to the client/or a class as u say u guys say i have to open my client.java , but i have downloaded my Client/Source and the Client is in Runserver.Bat , how can i change that and am i supposed to do that?
Q3) How should i create a class , i mean by that in which type of a file ? a notepad or what other file?
Q4) when i teleport my account disconnects and logs me out any solution for that?
Q5) how can i change the Icons of these below , i want it like the original oldschool version if you could possibly teach me on how to do it ,and remove the welcome screen also 
[img]http://i.imgur.com/8RzP88G.png[/img]
Q6) is there any possible way to move my screen with the Tilt/Scroll wheel like it is now in oldschool? can i edit that to my RSPS?
Q7)*out of subject**** i have viewed many topics on how to add npc to the game , you guys always act aggressive toward the guy who programmed it , i dont know why!
like he did something for you guys for free if it&#39;s wrong why you try to attack him in any way possible i mean he helped people for FREE and you humiliate him for nothing , i mean we already should be happy nonetheless of what he did wrong or correct .
alright im done with my questions hope i don&#39;t take alot of your time making you reading it , would really appreciate it if you reply to it and thank you &lt;3</description>

              <p>Hey Omar, please start off by downloading and using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to program. It’ll make programming a lot easier for you. It might seem confusing at first but once you get used to it you’ll thank me.</p>

<p>Project Insanity is a Server Source created by a person that went by the name Insanity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It depends. Sometimes you will need to edit the Client.java that is found in your Client source files, and sometimes you will have to edit the one found in your Server source files.<br>
Example: Changing the IP address is done in Client.java in the Client, but changing the login text is done in the Client.java Server sided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To create a class you can open a text document in Notepad, and then hit save. When on the save screen, change the file type to “all types” and then save it as “YourFileName.java”.<br>
The .class files will be generated when you compile the java source file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’d have to provide some more details. Like an error in console if there is one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To change the icons, you need to edit the sprites. They can be found in your cache or in a folder called "Sprites"<br>
To change/remove the login screen, take a look in Client.java server sided, look for the initialize() method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, google it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are you talking about? Most the time people act “aggressive” towards posts like that because they have been done 100001 times before, so a new tutorial is just a re-hashed version of the ones that have been done, and we do not need more of the exact same tutorials. We need <span class="bbcode-i">new</span> ones.</p>
