    <title>Legalize marijuana (round 2)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/legalize-marijuana-round-2/233444</link>
    <description>Ok so I saw another topic on this issue but it turned into garbage IMO.. So let&#39;s try and stay on topic and have an intellectual debate. Please read some of these points before voting or posting, as I have done a ton of research on this and feel that there really is no reason to keep it illegal. It can be used for many medical purposes as well. 

Here are my arguments and reasons:


Legalize it obviously.. We own our bodies, we should be able to choose what we put in them. Alcohol and cigarettes kill thousands of people each year, where marijuana has no long term negative side effects and has been proven to prevent cancer (search google if you don&#39;t believe me). No matter how long you sit there and smoke weed, you won&#39;t overdose - your memory may be off for a few days, but if you smoke in moderation, you will be fine. 

I have been smoking weed almost every day for the past 3 years and am actively pursuing a rigorous college degree in Network Administration &amp; Security with a 3.7 GPA. The people that smoke and get lazy have a weak willpower. Weed doesn&#39;t make you lazy, you choose to be lazy. 

Weed is nature&#39;s gift to man and should be enjoyed by everyone. If you haven&#39;t tried weed and you are against it, then you are a fool (not saying to try it if you don&#39;t want to, just don&#39;t be against it). Don&#39;t listen to what everyone is trying to tell you, the government is trying to brainwash you. Weed opens your mind up and the government does not want this.. They want control and they want you to be 100% obedient so they can go about using us for profit and support. But what have they done? They have managed to ruin our image as most people from other countries now hate Americans and think we are foolish. Don&#39;t accept this! Fight back and realize our government is not the loving, patriotic, guardian that it once was. 

There is a War against the American people called the War on Drugs. This is a declared war that is fighting to take away our freedom. If you honestly believe marijuana should remain illegal then you are a greedy, immature person that is trying to take away others&#39; enjoyment. Open your minds and realize that life is about experiences and enjoyment -- not how much money you make or how tough you are. Let people enjoy this gift from the Earth! Man has smoked weed for thousands of years and has loved it all throughout history, before any government was in power. Don&#39;t let the government take this away from us -- it is too precious to lose.

And for those that say legalizing it will make more people smoke it, you are wrong. Look at alcohol. It is actually easier for underage people to get marijuana than alcohol (at least this is true for where I&#39;m from, and many places I&#39;ve been) because marijuana is not regulated, whereas alcohol is. Growing it could still be illegal (or you could require a license of some sort to grow it) but ingesting it should not be illegal. 

The government could profit off taxing marijuana, studies have shown we could gain over $100 billion a year in profits just from taxing it. Also, the drug war costs us over $40 billion each year! Think about that, we are paying out of our pockets to put nonviolent weedsmokers in jail, for what? What have they done wrong? Does the government own us? NO!!!  THEY DID NOT CREATE LIFE.</description>

<p>Where did you get this information?<br>
I have driven plenty of times while high, and a few while extremely high. The ONLY time I was too high to drive was when we smoked about 11 bowls and had some freon before. We weren’t very stable. But still.</p>
<p>And I’m not going to try to say I drive better high, everyone thinks that. But I WILL say that my parents complimented me on driving better than I usually do with them.</p>

              <p>To be honest i dont really care, so what if they legalize it? im not gonna smoke it either way. One reason they probably will never legalize it is the hallucinogenic side of weed. If someone tries to drive while smoking they can still concentrate on the job at hand, whereas if they are doped up its a different situation.</p>

Ugh, it’s lower actually. A joint has like 33% of the tar that a cigarette has. The tests saying weed had more tar was innacurate. They used the entire plant material for the study. They didn’t just test the buds. And don’t forget, you don’t smoke 25 joints a day.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter, in my opinion, is that the only logical move for any government is to either legalize weed, or ban cigs and alcohol.</p>
<p>Now, as I said, I have nothing against weed.  But if it is legalized, it should be treated like alcohol.  I don’t care what anyone says, driving when you are high is dangerous.  Just like driving when you are drunk.  Which, really when you think about it, is the “high” that alcohol gives you.  You wouldn’t go to a class drunk, don’t go to a class high.</p>
<p>As long as people treat it properly, I don’t see a problem with it.</p>
<p>In fact, I think if they legalized it, even less people would smoke.  It’s just like when they say “If you have access to something, you will never want it as bad than if you didn’t.”</p>
