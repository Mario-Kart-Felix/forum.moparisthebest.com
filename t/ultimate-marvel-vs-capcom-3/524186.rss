Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 is &#39;standalone&#39; title from Marvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of two worlds. What was suppose to be an extension to Fate of Two Worlds turned into it&#39;s own game. This game is highly competitive, and you have to dedicate hours of practice to become efficient in fighting. The game consists of combos, team &#39;synergy&#39;, and type of play. This game should appeal to most people with it&#39;s superhero-ed background and conventional fighting tactics.

Overall, I&#39;d give this game a solid 8/10

Has anyone else played it, or plays it?</description>
