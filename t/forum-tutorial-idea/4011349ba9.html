<p>I am paying our friend who developed some parts for Enkrona, and by doing that Blake agreed to give me full ownership to the server.</p>
<p>And I’m fine if we simply have 2 different “official” slots on the sponsored server page.<br>
Assuming both the servers are developed from osiris, as dictated in the contract.<br>
As the whole point is to inspire developers to use osiris.</p>

        <p>Wait what? What does that mean (and how would it mean he gave up ownership)?</p>
<p>But two official servers basically ruins the entire point, I think it’s best that you two just come to some sort of agreement (and if so, Blakeman would probably have to give you back any ‘leaving’ money, but I don’t understand how that worked anyway) so that everyone gets something out if it, even if it isn’t exactly what you want. Because as it stands right now, if that was a legally binding contract (which I don’t know), then he still has part ownership rights to the server you’re hosting right now (even if he ‘left’ the development team; kinda how like investors don’t actually do anything as part of the company, they just put something into it then own part of it), AND part ownership rights to the base.</p>

        <p>It’s upsetting that I <span class="bbcode-i">still</span> must post to show everyone how wrong you are.<br>
I’m about to publish the contract itself so everyone can see how you are manipulating it and lying.</p>
<p>Boomer, you can whine all you want.  At the end of the day, you signed a legal fucking contract.<br>
You’re bound to it.  And it states (which MITB agrees with) that we both must be on the server project.</p>

<p>I am paying our friend who developed some parts for Enkrona, and by doing that Blake agreed to give me full ownership to the server.</p>
<p>And I’m fine if we simply have 2 different “official” slots on the sponsored server page.<br>
Assuming both the servers are developed from osiris, as dictated in the contract.<br>
As the whole point is to inspire developers to use osiris.[/quote]</p>
<p>I <span class="bbcode-i">never</span> fucking agreed to give you ownership of our server.  What the hell are you talking about?  Stop trying to steal our whole project from me.  You know that I worked my ass off writing the core from scratch while you were eating BBQ chips.  Yes you did content, but I did the core.  And that was the original agreement from the get-go.  I still own equal copyright as well.</p>
<blockquote>The Osiris emulator is copyright (C) 2010-2011 Blake Beaupain, Garrett Woodard, and Travis Burtrum.</blockquote>

No, you don’t owner the server you made together. Even if we’re saying he doesn’t need to sign anything to officially leave, that doesn’t give you <span class="bbcode-b">any</span> single ownership rights unless he specifically said he was giving his ownership to you. If I make a boat with someone, and then leave it in the marina without using it, does it make it solely the other persons property? He let you keep the hosted server, but I see no reason why, if he takes the source you guys made together (even if it doesn’t have all the content you have added since he left), and started hosting, why you would have any more rights to the sponsorship than he does.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Because the sponsorship doesn’t refer to either one of us, it refers to the server I hosted.<br>
And he gave up his rights to the server by me paying for him to leave.[/quote]</p>
<p>Um, no, the contract states (and I quote):</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">“The server the developers host using the software (currently at: <a href="http://enkrona.net/">enkrona.net</a>) will become the official server of <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/">moparisthebest.com</a>, and receive a prominent link to their website from the server status page (currently at: <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php">https://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php</a>), most likely in the form of a ‘Sponsored Server’.  This will continue for as long as <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/">moparisthebest.com</a> maintains a server status page, or as long as <a href="http://enkrona.net/">enkrona.net</a> maintains a server.”</span></p>
<p>Oh look, I can redirect <a href="http://enkrona.net/">enkrona.net</a> to a different host and maintain a server of my own based on Osiris.<br>
But instead, I’m willing to work with you for 50/50 of the profits.</p>
<p>That clearly is, however,  specific to the developers (not of Enkrona, but the developers as defined in the Terms section of the contract to be Blake Beaupain and Garrett Woodard) and not the project.  And if it is specific to the project (which it is not), then the only tangible defining factor of the project itself is the domain <a href="http://enkrona.net/">enkrona.net</a> which I own.  You are reading the word “host” as a noun (and referring it to the VPS that you pay to host) when in fact it is used as a verb referring to the action of us, the developers, hosting the server.</p>
<p>Like I stated before:</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]If I am right, neither of us can make use of this opportunity unless we work together<br>
[</em>]If you are right, then I can solely make use of this opportunity as according to the contract I own the said project through ownership of <a href="http://enkrona.net/">enkrona.net</a>[/ul]</p>
<p>You are purposefully misinterpreting the contract that you signed, and you are attempting obviously to twist the words into a situation that works better for you.  The contract is as it is, and should be interpreted as it is and was when it was signed by the 3 of us.  It is specific to the developers, not the project itself.  And if - as you so claim through misinterpretation - it is specific to the project, then the project is clearly owned by me as the <span class="bbcode-b">only tangible defining factor</span> of the project within the contract is the domain <a href="http://enkrona.net/">enkrona.net</a>.</p>
<p>tl;dr you signed a legal contract, deal with the set forth conditions.<br>
I have everything legally in my power to completely exclude you from this, because I myself maintain ownership of the domain.</p>
<p>And I choose not to screw you over with the very contract that you signed because that would make me no better than you.</p>

<p>The domain has nothing to do with it.<br>
All it mentions is the current domain at which the time the server was hosted.<br>
The important part is the server.</p>

        <p>The contract is a bit vague. It states two factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>The continuity of hosting at the domain <a href="http://enkrona.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">enkrona.net</a>
</li>
<li>The server the developer<span class="bbcode-b">s</span> host will become the sponsored server of <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The initial interpretation almost makes you think that both people must be involved in the process of hosting it, and thereby creating the official server. Nevertheless, the single factor of “will become” implies that it is a single instance. It basically says the official server will be made at an instance where both developers are hosting the server (which is true, as one developer represents the domain and the other, the host). The contract refers both to hosting and to the domain, therefore to both developers. Nevertheless, the reference is valid so long as the server is not the official server of moparscape. After it has become thus, then only the second installment, being the conditions of the server being maintained by <a href="http://enkrona.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">enkrona.net</a> and the sponsored server page by <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>, is valid.</p>
<p>IANAL, but the contract (at least that portion), basically says you two only need to work together until the server is recognized by mopar as being the official server. Thereafter, the special spot for the server status page only exists, by contract, through the <a href="http://enkrona.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">enkrona.net</a> domain. My interpretation is rather simple. If mopar considers Osiris to be the official server, which from what I’ve seen he does, then by all means boomer is correct, but so is blake. Both of you are right on the button regarding <a href="http://enkrona.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">enkrona.net</a>. The server must be <span class="bbcode-b">hosted</span> through that <span class="bbcode-b">domain</span>. So, indeed, at this point in the contract, blake holds all the power if he owns the domain.</p>
<p>You know, I’m friends with both of you, and I don’t want to take sides. To be honest, I don’t like how this ended up at all. But honestly, contracts are designed to protect the constituents. As david said, they are there to prevent one of you from screwing over the other. Nevertheless, blake has that power here (a limitation in the contract, imo), but he is refusing to use it. As for anything you both agreed to outside of this contract, it is complete moot. All that matters is this contract, everything else is not legally binding and therefore irrelevant. Any lawyer would tell you the same. Intentions really don’t matter when there is a legally binding contract to dictate the way things ought to be.</p>
<p>So seriously, shit happens. Just get over it and work together, please. This community needs something good, and I really don’t want to see mopar jacked out of $7,000. He went out of his way to pay you a large portion of his profits from the sponsored server page so you could be apart of the rebirth of one of the most prestigious communities in the scene. Ages ago, people would have found the participation alone enough of a payment. Stop considering this a job and consider it a contribution. I don’t care how difficult it is to work together, just do it. You’re both stuck together until this is over, so you might as well do what you need to do.</p>
<p>On a side note: the contract has nothing to do with profits earned by enkrona. As blake well knows, boomer can completely choose to keep profits earned by the enkrona server for himself, even though blake is contracted to the enkrona server. Nevertheless, boomer knows blake’s power in owning the domain. It’s icky, but it’s reality. What happens on <a href="http://enkrona.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">enkrona.net</a> is again moot to the contract itself, so keep it there. Just get together to finish the server so moparscape doesn’t completely suck for once, then deal with the petty profit details on your own time (not intending to be rude at all).</p>
<p>Side side note: sorry for another obnoxiously long post. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
