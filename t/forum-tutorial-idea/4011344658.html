<p>I’m quite aware of enkrona. I was referring to you providing a dedicated server specifically for this community’s use. Am I still wrong in saying I am doubtful of you possessing a dedicated server for that purpose? If so, then I’m pleased because it solves one more headache in trying to get Osiris viral in this scene.</p>

<p>You don’t have to leave the contract.<br>
You left the development team of the server that uses the software (currently hosted at <a href="http://www.enkrona.net/">www.enkrona.net</a>).</p>
<p>The contract dictates that server is the one that will be the official server of moparscape.[/quote]</p>
<p>The contract dictates that a server hosted by the <span class="bbcode-b">developers</span> will be the official server of MoparScape.<br>
The contract defines the <span class="bbcode-b">developers</span> as you and me, not the people working on the Enkrona project.</p>
<p>As far as the contract is concerned, we could start a new project using Osiris and it would work.<br>
It is specific to the <span class="bbcode-b">developers</span>, and <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> to the project.</p>
<p>But if you want to say that the contract was specific to the project, then the <span class="bbcode-b">only</span> tangible defining aspect is “currently at: <a href="http://enkrona.net/">enkrona.net</a>” which I own.  If you really want to try to state that is is specific to the project and not the developers, then the <span class="bbcode-i">only single defining factor</span> of the project is that it is at <a href="http://enkrona.net/">enkrona.net</a>.  I’m still willing to work together on this, but you wont let me join the Enkrona project again unless you get 70% of the profits which I’m not okay with.</p>
<p>Your own point, that it is specific to the project, does not work for you as the project is only defined by the domain that I own.<br>
MITB, we need to talk this out in voice over Mumble.</p>
<p>There are two ways that this can be interpreted - that it is specific to the project, or that it is specific to the developers.  My view is that it is specific to the developers, as the contract clearly states so.  If, however, it is specific to the contract and not the developers (which, in my interpretation, is completely false), then the only way that the contract defined the project is by the domain.</p>
<p>If my interpretation is correct, then neither of us can use this opportunity until we work together on a project based on Osiris.<br>
If your interpretation is correct, then we can either work together or I can use it solely as I own <a href="http://enkrona.net/">enkrona.net</a> which the contract defined as the project.</p>

<p>Don’t even talk about greedy. You barely programmed after the first 3 days of the project.<br>

<p>You left the project out of your own choosing, and now you want back in because you want to use the ‘official server spot’ to advertise your friends server that isn’t even using osiris.<br>
And then when you realized that wasn’t going to happen, you’re trying to get back into enkrona now that most of the work is done. And you had the nerve to demand 50/50 from the profits. So don’t even start with “greedy”</p>

In the contract, host is used as a verb and not a noun.

Nowhere in the contract does it state that "if a developer leaves the Enkrona project, he forfeits his holdings in this contract."
You are making ridiculous shit up, stick to what the contract states.  By the way, we had a verbal agreement that if I left Enkrona, you would pay $500 to samuraiblood2.  Which you haven't done in several months.
<blockquote>Don't even talk about greedy. You barely programmed after the first 3 days of the project.</blockquote>
Let's see how well your code works without the server core that hosts it (which I made).  A server is not a server if clients cannot connect to it.
<blockquote>And you wanted 50% of the profits. Even though I programmed about 40k out of the 50k lines.</blockquote>
We never said that whoever codes more gets more profit.  We started the project as 50/50, and it never changed.

I'm only offering to re-join Enkrona so we can work together and benefit off this contract.
<p>The fact of the matter is as follows:</p>
<p>If I am right - that the contract defines this by the developers and not the project: then we cannot make use of this until we work together on a project based on Osiris.</p>

<p>i say fuck off you leech. you’ve been nothing but a thorn in my side.<br>
i’ve poured a years worth of work into this project, and I let you have 3500$.<br>
then after we sold it you continued not to develop a single line.<br>
i continued to ask you to help, but you refused saying you were bored with the project and wanted to move on.<br>
then i told you to leave enkrona, and you asked me to buy your “shares” of enkrona.<br>
then we finally came to an agreement for you to leave, and now you want back in cuz you see money.</p>

        <p>[quote=“blakeman8192, post:31, topic:401134”]You <span class="bbcode-b">told me</span> to leave Enkrona bro.<br>
You said you’d pay samurai and you never did.</p>
<p>Remember that you signed the contract dude.<br>
We can all benefit off this, or if you’re going to be stubborn, then none of us can.</p>
<p>MITB isn’t going to disregard the legal contact just so you can benefit from it.<br>
We all signed it, we can all benefit from it.  Or you can be stubborn and greedy and we can do nothing with this opportunity.[/quote]</p>
<p>stubborn and greedy? coming from the kid who left a server with high potential cuz he was lazy.<br>
then when its almost done he runs back and demands 50/50.</p>
<p>yup i’m the stubborn and greedy one.</p>
<p>This is the post where he announced he was leaving Enkrona (<a href="http://enkrona.net/forums/showthread.php?1314-Leaving" rel="nofollow noopener">http://enkrona.net/forums/showthread.php?1314-Leaving</a>)</p>
<blockquote>Hey guys, I'm leaving Enkrona.
<p>Let’s face it, Enkrona doesn’t interest me anymore. I’ve tried to recommit myself to it over the past few months and it’s just not working out. I’m not going to bullshit anyone anymore. I’m tired of arguing with Boomer about working on it and the profit splits. I’m bored with Enkrona. I had a great time with all of you, and I’m sure Boomer will take this project far.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll be one of your fellow players once Enkrona is out.<br>
Peace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how he mentions the future of the server? How he’ll be one of the ‘fellow players’.<br>
And now out of the blue he wants back in and a split of the profits.</p>
<p>Moparisthebest, if you want a well developed server that brings much innovation to this dry landscape, AND is built off Osiris, and IS THE SPECIFIC server mentioned in the deal, then we can talk.<br>
But Blake will not be a part of it, as he had already forfeited his spot in the ownership.</p>

        <p>I agree with Blakeman, it isn’t up to ONE person to dictate where your software is hosted. If Blakeman started to host the software as well, what would happen then? That quote says ‘currently at’, which means that it is subject to change if the circumstances change.</p>
<p>As long as the server uses the software that you guys made together, he should be able to rejoin at any time (otherwise one could just kick the other out, right?) and get the same benefits as the other. Unless he countersigned a void for the contract (or it expires), he’s still part of it even if he decides to ‘leave’ or become inactive.</p>
<p>EDIT - Though it seems a bit off that boomer put 4 months more work into the server since blakeman went inactive there, but that wasn’t in the contract.</p>

<p>We couldn’t kick each other out, we made an agreement for him to leave.</p>
<p>Oh and it wasn’t just four months. It was about 8 months that I programmed and he didn’t.<br>
The thing is he left the entire project, I had to pay to make him leave.<br>
And now he wants back in? Its complete shit.</p>
<p>The contract says the server we developed and hosted would become the official server.<br>
That server we developed and hosted is still the same, its just he is not part of the company anymore.</p>
<p>If a studio makes a game, and a publisher agrees to publish it, and one of the developers of the studio leaves half way through, there is no reason the publisher should stop publishing it. Nor does that publishing agreement give any right for the strayed developer to join the studio again.</p>

<p>We aren’t a company. We don’t have termination clauses, or employment contracts.<br>
Therefore we don’t need a signing saying he left.</p>
<p>The fact is that I own the hosting that still is pointed to from <a href="http://www.enkrona.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.enkrona.net</a><br>
The contract still should be in affect to sponsor my server.</p>

        <p>You need to make up your mind. If you guys are following a contract system, you need to follow it all the way though, from the creation contract to a termination contract.

<p>The contract only specifies the server we developed, hosted at <a href="http://enkrona.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">enkrona.net</a>.<br>
It doesn’t specify any company, or that we have to be together.<br>
I own the server we developed, I own the hosting it. I should own the official server sponsorship. \</p>
<p>Plus we did have a verbal contract for him to leave, I haven’t fulfilled the terms of that agreement yet, but say I do this week, then he has official left, and I should have all rights if we want to argue that he did officially leave.</p>
