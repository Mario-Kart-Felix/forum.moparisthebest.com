[center][color=navy]     We are looking to put togther a private server that is above the regular. Although the project is just begenning a new stage, becoming a &quot;company&quot;, because i am only able to do so much and the time i can spend on it is so little that i would like to put togther a team to allow for more rapid groth and a much more diversely able server. we can start from a work of mine which is developed or we can begin from a new framework, it is up to the team. I would like to have it released in stages.[/center]
