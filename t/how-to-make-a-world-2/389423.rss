<p>What? It depends how you’re doing it. It reads the same thing, and writes the same thing assuming it’s the same server but a different instance. The only issue would be (As stated in my post) IO overwriting itself and possible flaws in the system such as dupes etc…</p>

<p>Ahh, I see. Sorry I didn’t see that before. This may be off topic, but why would you want two worlds in the first place unless you have a very large amount of players that (for some reason) want to be away from the crowds?</p>

<p>I don’t understand why you would use that method, if you actually cared about your server then I would not. I’d rather run multiple instances and use a world selection based applet on a web server - it would look so much more professional.</p>
<p>You could also assign each instance a specific amount of RAM for the JVM, when doing that method, you also have to take into account global actions such as yelling and abuse. Though it may seem like an easier option I simply don’t agree with the way it’s designed, though that is up for speculation on both accounts.</p>

              <p>Assuming this is an average 317; should be something like the following.  You may have other things which use IO which you may want to edit, this can be included in SQL as well.</p>
<p>Client.java/differs</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">try {
            characterfile = new BufferedReader(
                    new FileReader("./characters2/" + playerName + ".txt")); // changed

            File myfile2 = new File(FTPAdress + "/" + playerName + ".txt"); //saveAs

            if (myfile1.lastModified() &lt; myfile2.lastModified()) {
                characterfile = characterfile2; //changed
            }
</code></pre>
<p>That will do it too characters2, and then PlayerHandler.java</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">try {
            characterfile = new BufferedWriter(
                    new FileWriter("./characters2/" + plr.playerName + ".txt")); //changesSaveAs
</code></pre>
<p>I just edited my code on a random source too try it, it works. Then obviously you need to make a new folder called characters2. Yours might look different but shouldn’t be too hard to workout. If you want too make them both the same directory, then you can easily reverse what I just did. I’ll show you, assuming they’re in different directories,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">try {
            characterfile = new BufferedWriter(
                    new FileWriter("./dir/characters/" + plr.playerName + ".txt"));
</code></pre>
<p>That will write the file into the same directory as the other server.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">try {
            characterfile = new BufferedReader(
                    new FileReader("./dir/characters/" + playerName + ".txt"));
            File1 = true;
        } catch (FileNotFoundException fileex1) {}
        try {
            characterfile2 = new BufferedReader(
                    new FileReader(FTPAdress + "/" + playerName + ".txt"));
            File2 = true;
        } catch (FileNotFoundException fileex2) {}
        if (File1 == true &amp;&amp; File2 == true) {
            File myfile1 = new File("./dir/characters/" + playerName + ".txt");
            File myfile2 = new File(FTPAdress + "/" + playerName + ".txt");

            if (myfile1.lastModified() &lt; myfile2.lastModified()) {
                characterfile = characterfile;
            }
</code></pre>
<p>That will read etc, it’s really straight forward. I’m basing the directory off a guess, it’d be better if they’re in the same one but might look messy. You can just make the sources connect, but be warned some might use different values from another so it might not be able to read those values and recognize them.</p>
<p>I go into to much detail - but it will still use the same source just the IO uses a different directory, this can be used on another source as well if the values which it reads/stores are the same (If not the value will just be ignored). Simply edit the directory to the source you want to read/save data to. You obviously have to run multiple instances of the server, most likely on different ports.</p>
<p>Making the two read from the same directory and update the same directory will save to the same place no matter what world they’re on, so you then have 2 worlds <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If you have any issues feel free to PM me or post here, it is effectively the same for every source it’s just a caseof variables and values IO uses, also the directory and the location at which the IO is located can differ.</p>
<p><a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/</a></p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>If you want to make it more obvious which world is which, you can easily edit server class to signify it and create multiple directories for the worlds. As follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void run() {</code></pre>
<p>Seach for that in server class, this is your run method. You can edit what is printed on the CMD. It uses misc.println() etc etc…</p>
<p>Add a println to the run() method so it tells you what world it is on startup, an easy way to remind yourself, or print a message in the IO.</p>
<p>e.g</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">misc.println("World 2 is current online!");</code></pre>
<p>For world 2! For saving a message in the IO do the same but in the methods which the IO is executed.</p>
<p>e.g</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">try {
            characterfile = new BufferedReader(
                    new FileReader("./characters2/" + playerName + ".txt")); // changed
            File1 = true;
        } catch (FileNotFoundException fileex1) {}
        try {
            characterfile2 = new BufferedReader(
                    new FileReader(FTPAdress + "/" + playerName + ".txt")); //just saveAs
            File2 = true;
        } catch (FileNotFoundException fileex2) {}
        if (File1 == true &amp;&amp; File2 == true) {
            File myfile1 = new File("./characters2/" + playerName + ".txt"); //changed
            File myfile2 = new File(FTPAdress + "/" + playerName + ".txt"); //saveAs
           //add a println to where you think
            if (myfile1.lastModified() &lt; myfile2.lastModified()) {
                characterfile = characterfile2; //changed
            }
</code></pre>
<p>I like to go into to much detail, naming a directory as I stated would also be a good simple method but I like to provide all roads as an option <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>The only issue you may have is people logging on each world at the same time so the Character file would be written on my two locations so things could be potentially overwrote and edited, I’m sure you could universally save an IP to a file and check it with both worlds (Just a quick method I’ve thought off, probably tons more). If this isn’t solved it could leave it open to account hijackers to target players.</p>
<p>And would allow players to train 2 skills at once just in different instances (As it’s writing the same character file). Just look at a 1 IP per connection tutorial and make it global across two areas, it won’t be hard, PM me if you want more detail. Most people see multiple worlds  as easy - which it is, it just comes with security risks and potential flaws which most people don’t see.</p>
