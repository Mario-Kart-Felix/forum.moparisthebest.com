    <title>No-ip problem. Js5connect error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-ip-problem-js5connect-error/378495</link>
    <description>ok, so heres what i do. Turn on no-ip, then i check mark my adress, then i compile server, and run it. It doesn&#39;t have an ipchanger, but in the client file on the client, i put 0.0.0.0. Then i try to connect and it doesn&#39;t work. Now if i turn off no-ip, it works! and i connect. But my brother on another laptop. He has the same client, and sets the ip in the client spot, but it doesn&#39;t work for him. He gets the same error. Because i turned the no-ip off. So how do i make it so i can put on my certian ip adress, but if i do that, i can&#39;t play on my own laptop. But if i don&#39;t turn it on, my bro can&#39;t play. WTF!</description>
