    <title>Advice pl0x?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/advice-pl0x/127649</link>
    <description>Hey guys I feel kind&#39;ve stupid for asking this :o, but I kinda hit a brick wall on my creative side, I&#39;m getting paid to redesign my employers web site and I am trying to think of ways to make it look more professional and that isn&#39;t really my area. So I was wondering on some pointers, the site is www.donnlordphoto.com. I stripped out all of the crappy looking links on the top and made up some buttons for them, I also fixed the titles and shit. Any input and code would be much appreciated.

<p>I ended up going with some warm colors and buttons to keep it easy on the eyes and keep it clean and professional, I think I’ll take your idea and put a border around the text too. Thanks &lt;3++.</p>
