<p>Agreed, I’m still back where I started. The tutorial in the link just gave me a lot of errors. All i want to do at the moment is get the client working, meaning, this should be in client help. I am running two .bat files at moment one with a listener port of 43594 and the other of 43595, but it only connects to the on with 43595.</p>
<p>EDIT: Please close, Have fixed the problem.</p>

<p>Because you’re wrong…Having different worlds work in different heights is just an invitation for problems later on, ESPECIALLY since he’s planning on running a spawn server on one, and an eco on another. What about mini games that use different heights for different instances? For example, on my server if two clans go into zombies, each clan ends up in a different height level so there is no interference. Now if I add a second world on the same server just in a different height, I have completely unnecessary complications with my worlds and my minigames. Not to mention the issue of having to separate spawn and eco commands based on heights for the OP, a problem that is made harder by minigames that take advantage of height levels to allow multiple people/clans/w\e to play the same minigame at the same time as others without having to wait for them to finish.</p>
<p>I get where you’re coming from. It seems like less effort to just do it using the heights. It may even seem like a creative solution, but when you really think about it, it’s just not…</p>
