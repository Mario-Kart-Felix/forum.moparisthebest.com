    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-making-npcs-nonvisible-on-condition/425885</link>
    <description>ok, so i just made this quest and i was wondering if there was a way to make it so if they have reached a certain point in the quest, i can make the Npc&#39;s disapear, cuz they arent needed anymore. i can make it so they wont talk to the people anymore, but tht contradicts the story line. so please any help is much appreciated (possibly rep&#39;d)</description>
