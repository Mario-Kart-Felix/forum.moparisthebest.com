    <title>Hybridscape Node System</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hybridscape-node-system/360842</link>
    <description>What is a node: [b]A controller for different aspects of the hybridscape server. it may or may not effect the game server directly[/b]

[b]Node types[/b] 

[ol][li]Server Node[/li][/ol]
 - Accepts incoming connections example would be the gameserver or a loginserver, friend server

[ul][li]Connection Node - Connects to a server and maintains the connection example: (World 1 hosts the gameserver and the login server, World2 Hosts a gameserver but uses a connection node to world 1&#39;s login server)[/li]
[li]Bypass Node - For when the server host is lazy or has no need for a server or connection node (most moparscapers)[/li]
[li]Other Node - I put this one here for undefined purposes it may be scrapped[/li][/ul]


The Game Server is a required Node to be running in the node manager and the Game Server will also require 3 other nodes (bypass will be the most common) to be functioning

What Nodes the Game Server Requires:

[ol][li]Login Node[/li]
[li]Friends Node[/li][/ol]




Well that&#39;s as far as I&#39;ve gotten on this for the time being.</description>
