    <description>[size=14pt][b]Need a Host?[/b][/size]

I will host any server from 317 to 525&#39;s protocols. I am currently looking for someone in need of a host, and that has a good source and experience in coding his server.

[b]Requirements:[/b]
- Must not LEECH!
- Have a stable coding
- Great home with thieving IN HOME. (No Tele to thieve!)
- Dupes have to be fixed! If they are not, and someone dupes, they will have to be, or i will close the server.
- Slayer has to work! Required levels to kill slayer monsters such as abbysal demons must work.
- Slayer drops has to be good. 
- Rock crab training.
- Monster teleport to default locations (brimhaven, taverly, etc..)
- Nice pking zones!
- Shops will have to be edited. I don&#39;t want shops to sell whips too cheap etc.. i want people to have a good challenge!

Things to add: Eventualy, those will have to be added by the coder

- Donator Shop
- Donator Area
- Website for the server with forums and a chatbox
- Voting point system (A MUST)

To apply to get the spot, please post screenshots and specifications on your server. I also would like a short description about how long you&#39;ve been coding, and an email to contact you.</description>
