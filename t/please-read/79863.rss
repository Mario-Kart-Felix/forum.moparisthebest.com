    <description>I&#39;m trying to get willow whacker to work by lorax and sumilion, Im only confused on 1 part, the colors. The script says start in draynor bank/ or willows and it says it auto picks colors but it really doesn;t work that well, so on line 881-889 it says this.
function GotColor(ColorType: string): Boolean;
begin
  case LowerCase(ColorType) of
    &#39;bank&#39;  : Result := (BankColor    &gt; 0);
    &#39;road&#39;  : Result := (RoadColor    &gt; 0);
    &#39;ladder&#39;: Result := (LadderColor  &gt; 0);
    &#39;quest&#39; : Result := (QuestColor   &gt; 0);
    &#39;farm&#39;  : Result := (FarmingColor &gt; 0);
  end;
I Think i got most of it figuard out,
   for the bank color i just take the bank symbol in the top right corner map right? the gold symbol. 
  for the road? where do i take the color from what road? 
for the ladder? where the heck is a ladder in draynor? 
for the quest symbol im fonfused because theres 1 quest symbol on the docks by the willwos and one by the pig place closer twords the bank.
ANd fro the farm spot, thats the one right by the willows right?
 thank you so much for the help.
o yeah, if anyone has the script where do i put the willow colors? i looked but it&#39;s a big script if you could give me the lines that would be great. thanks again. And i just noticed this but in the script it says &#39;Bar&#39; so do i ge the color of the drink ion the mini map buy the willows? please answer any of these questions.
sorry for the double posting.
here you go.
