    <description>okay so, hello, I&#39;ve been Playing coding and hosting RSPS Since 2009.
 also I&#39;ve been coding Websites (PHP, HTML, JAVA SCRIPTS, CSS+, DESIGNER) for 6 years now.

 well i&#39;m looking for some awesome RSPS which is not popular and wants to be popular and has a goal that it wants to achieve.
 I&#39;ll take care of the website and help coding and pay for advertise it on websites and shit like that, i can add allot of things to website,
 Highscores, vote4cash, and etc....

 i can pay for the website domain which will be .com, all you need is:
 a server with goal ahead of it.
 server that is up and at least can be hosted 24/7.
 i don&#39;t care if its popular or not.
 it must be with version 700+ (not old rs).

 what will i get?
 i will get owner, but:
 i wont make staff with out talking things out with the other owner.
 i wont sell staff for rs cash or real money.
 i wont make any decision without talking things over with the other owner.

 if your interested please comment below or add me on skype: ahmed.diab1998

 Thanks.</description>

              <p>Hi there.<br>
If you’re looking to join a development team for a R.S.P.S., then please visit <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,125.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this section of the forums</a>. Just take a look around until you find a server in development that you like, and you can check if they are looking for a developer in <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,149.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this section of the forums</a>.<br>
For future reference, understand that these sorts of topics are not welcome on these forums, and you can easily find a team to join by looking in the RS2 Server Development boards.<br>
Good luck.</p>
