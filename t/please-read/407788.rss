    <description>Alright, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve asked for help.

My issue is mainly with a few skills.

Thieving does not work.
Fishing partially works.
Hunter does not work.

Also, there are a few more things that need to be fixed.

I would love to have assistance via TeamViewer. Please leave a reply below and I&#39;ll inbox you with my information.

Thank you so much!</description>
