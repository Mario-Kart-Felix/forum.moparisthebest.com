    <description>Hello,

I have been playing Moparscape for a good time and it has gotten boring. Its sorta like running on windows 95 with H4X.
Well is anyone working on a client higher than 377? Because most people who started one were born with ADD and quit 
within the first month. Well, is anyone without ADD or ADHD or ADGF or ADETYD or some other so called &quot;disease&quot;
working on a new client? Please tell me with a link!  :D [br][size=1]Posted on: July 16, 2007, 12:03:30 AM[/size][hr]ah - someone delete my last 2 posts. My session timed out and went hay-wire</description>
