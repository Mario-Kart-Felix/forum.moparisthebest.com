    <description>Ok i know how to run a server etc &amp; ive done it before, but i tried last night to put my server on the status list and it says:

So i went to sleep, tried again this morning and i still get the exact same error message. I have no idea whats wrong, ive tried different server sources to make sure that its not just mine.


Server IP:  89.243.244.157

If someone could try and connect i would be very grateful.

Thanks! :)


EDIT: Is the &#39;register a server&#39; not working; or is it just not working for me? :|[br][size=1]Posted on: July 21, 2007, 06:58:18 AM[/size][hr]Wow lol..turns out some reason XP firewall was on. Fixed</description>
