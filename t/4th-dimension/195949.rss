    <description>Do you think there are higher Dimensions than us? And what about the 1st Dimension. what could it look like? And what do you think the higher Dimensions look like?

Oh, okay, I see what you mean. Would you call it… 3.5D?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Call what 3.5D? Either it’s 3D or 4D, there’s no in between. We have 3 spatial, perpendicular directions, the 4th dimension has 4 spatial, perpendicular directions. There cannot be half a spatial direction.</p>
<p>Think of it this way, we have 3 dimensions. Those dimensions are width, depth, and height, and each of those 3 directions are perpendicular. In the 4th dimension, there would be another direction which is perpendicular to those 3. However we only see one “point” of that 4th dimension at a time (cross-sections), thus we experience time.[/quote]<br>

<p>Think about it for a second.  Light travels in a straight line.  For it to cast a shadow, it has to strike the surface.  So if light is traveling along the surface, it never touches, and hence does not cause brightness, nor shadow.  However, if it hits a line, it causes light on that one dimensional surface.  The shadow will appear one dimensional.</p>
<p>And another point that you’re wrong is that a shadow in a 3D world is actually three dimensional, not two dimensional.</p>

<p>Well what interests me is what could it be like as a flat lander? as in to never eat because if you had a esophpogus youd spil in half. and if there are living things in the other dimensions or are there jus infinite space?

<p>It can’t exist, because to be even flat you would need some measure of depth.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<ol>
<li>By theory, the 2nd dimension doesn’t lack depth, it lacks height.</li>
<li>Height, in a “flat” world, would simply be null.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice the quotes around “flat”. Flat is a description of a 3-dimensional object. Nothing in the 2nd dimension would be flat, it would simply lack height. “Flat” implies it has some form of measurable height, which obviously the 2nd dimension would not.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Then how could it exist? I know of only objects that can exist in 4 dimensions.  If it doesn’t have height, how can it exist? Hmf, I think I am still thinking in 3/4d terms, but I am having a hard time believing this. Are you sure?<br>
[/quote]<br>
I am positive, it doesn’t have to have height to exist in the 2nd dimension, only to exist in the 3rd. Likewise, I 3-dimensional object could not exist in the 4th, but it exists in the 3rd without problems.</p>
<p>In the 2nd dimension, you could only move forward, back, left, right, and rotate left and right. You could not move or look up or down.</p>
<p>In the 3rd dimension, if a shadow is cast, that shadow is 2 dimensional, correct? In the 2nd dimension, a shadow would be one dimensional, and in the 4th dimension, a shadow would be 3 dimensional.[/quote]<br>
A shadow in 2. dimension will be 2D.<br>
And a shadow in 4th dimension will also be 2D.<br>
And shadow in 1. dimension will be 1D.<br>
And in 0 dimension there will be no shadow at all.</p>

About the shadow theory, it would not be 3D dimensional in our world, it would be two dimensional. Technically it would be 3D dimensional, as it’s impossible for anything in a 3 dimensional world to not be 3 dimensional. But look at it theoretically, if a shadow is cast on a flat surface, it is 2 dimensional. In this I mean it doesn’t have “layers”, or any measurable depth. The object the shadow is cast on does, but the shadow is “flat” against said object.</p>
<p>So I was not saying a shadow is 3D in our world, I was saying in the 4th dimension, the shadow would be 3 dimensional. An entity in the 4th dimension would be saying “technically the shadow is 4 dimensional, but the shadow is “flat” <span class="bbcode-i">(I don’t know the 3 dimensional equivalent for flat)</span> against the 4 dimensional object.”<br>
[/quote]<br>
We are in the 4th dimension I think, since 4th dimension is related to time.[/quote]<br>
No, I mean in terms of spatial value. We are in the 3rd dimension, we experience cross-sections of the 4th dimensions as time. An entity in the 4th dimension would not experience cross-sections of the 4th dimensions as we do, but full 4 dimensional objects.</p>

<p>Hmm.  The thing about a shadow is that you would have to delve into the definition of “shadow” to understand whether it is 3 dimensional.  Is the shadow the lack of light cast upon a surface or does it include the surface?  If the former, then it is not an object and cannot be classified with dimensions.  If it is the latter, then it is 3 dimensional because the surface is never perfectly flat.</p>
