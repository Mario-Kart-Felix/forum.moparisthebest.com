    <description>Note to moderators: I posted this, and then I didn&#39;t expect it to be visible yet, but it already appeared publicly.  If I did something wrong, let me know, don&#39;t just throw infractions at me.

[size=30pt]LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO WISH TO JOIN THIS PROJECT.  IF INTERESTED, EMAIL siggi@imdifferent.co.cc[/size]

[size=18pt]I have started a new project The Difference 317 Server.
So far, I&#39;ve only completed the basics of the game server, which is multiple world support, cross-world private chatting, and a very simple world selection dialog for the client.

Multiple world support allows for servers to run anywhere in the world, it doesn&#39;t have to be all on one computer using different port numbers for each world.  Right now, logging into a game world will cause the game world to send a request to the central server to process the login, and then the central server sends the account data back if the login is successful.[/size]

[size=18pt]The server has a very simple GUI.  Even though it has a GUI, it will also be compatible with headless environments, such as a Linux VPS server without the GNOME desktop environment installed, and unlike other servers with GUIs, it will not crash if it is unable to put a GUI on-screen.[/size]

[size=18pt]I need people who are excellent in Java coding, and have experience with 317 servers to help out with this server.  If you&#39;re interested in joining, leave me a message.[/size]

<p>I didn’t say “not nice,” and “nice” has a different definition from “good.”  Check the dictionary if you don’t believe me.  However it is not nice to cause trouble for other peoples projects just for the sake of it, and you’re just wasting your time and my time, so get off this thread.  Believe me, I take trouble makers seriously, and if I were able to do anything damaging to you, and you as a trouble maker, by taking lawful actions, I will take every chance I can to do it.</p>

              <p>[quote=“whackatre, post:2, topic:435468”]This looks great! Are all of those features original?</p>
<p>Good luck![/quote]</p>
<p>All features are original, all crowns are customized by me, except the moderator crown which I left as default.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen anything else anywhere else.  Maybe some servers had multiple world support, but all the worlds run on the same computer, rather than different places around the world, and did not have cross-world private chat support.  As you could see in the screenshot, one server was in North America, and another server was in Asia.</p>

<p>[size=18pt]I have started a new project The Difference 317 Server.<br>
So far, I’ve only completed the basics of the game server, which is multiple world support, cross-world private chatting, and a very simple world selection dialog for the client.</p>
<p>Multiple world support allows for servers to run anywhere in the world, it doesn’t have to be all on one computer using different port numbers for each world.  Right now, logging into a game world will cause the game world to send a request to the central server to process the login, and then the central server sends the account data back if the login is successful.[/size]</p>

<p>[size=18pt]The server has a very simple GUI.  Even though it has a GUI, it will also be compatible with headless environments, such as a Linux VPS server without the GNOME desktop environment installed, and unlike other servers with GUIs, it will not crash if it is unable to put a GUI on-screen.[/size]</p>

<p>[size=18pt]I need people who are excellent in Java coding, and have experience with 317 servers to help out with this server.  If you’re interested in joining, leave me a message.[/size]</p>
