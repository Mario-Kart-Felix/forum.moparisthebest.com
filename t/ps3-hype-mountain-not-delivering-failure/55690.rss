Thats what I feel like saying to SCEA’s director.<br>
An interview with the guy:</p>
<blockquote>[b]EGM[/b]: PS3's launch has had the most negativity of any launch surrounding it, what happened?
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Tretton</span>: The problem we have…it’s society in general.</p>
</blockquote><br>
Best person ever.
