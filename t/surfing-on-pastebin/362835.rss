Dear Justine,


Not seeing you for days has been so hard for me. I can&#39;t stop thinking about you and the way you make me feel when we played NRPK. Every time I see a dragon longsword I think of you.. I&#39;ve never felt this way about anyone before, or a dragon longsword. I remember all the talks we used to have in ::di, and how all the noobs would come up to you and ask you questions and you&#39;d be like &quot;Yo! Nigga, shut the fuck up!&quot; It would make me laugh so hard and at the same time it made me fall in love with you. You&#39;re such a gangsta bitch and that&#39;s the kind of girl I want in my life. When you told me you wear Jordans I was so turned on. I love Michael Jordan and his shoes and girls that wear his shoes. I hope your feet aren&#39;t huge like his, hehehe. :P Anyways I was wondering if you wanted to come back to NRPK with me and be my girlfriend. I&#39;m sorry I made you jealous by using that other girl. I was scared of my true feelings for you and the only way I could play it off was by joking around and pushing you away. Every time I login I hope I see &quot;CrazyBitchJustine&quot; is online. I wander the streets of Varrock waiting for you to login. You&#39;re the dragon sq to my dragon legs. Without you, I&#39;m just a noob. I&#39;d give anything for you to come back and find me in Varrock.

Yesterday I was walking around Falador and I thought I saw you in the General Shop. I rushed in nearly breaking the door down. The shop owners looked at me like I was retarded. Turns out all I saw was a noob in a rune skirt. 


Justine, please come back to me.


Love always,

Ray &quot;Godfather&quot; Thomas&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Never lol&#39;d so bad</description>
