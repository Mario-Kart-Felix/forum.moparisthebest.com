    <title>[667] Need some help here</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-need-some-help-here/490920</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
So recently ive been trying to add a custom minigame to my 667, it is a wilderness involved minigame, and no matter what I do I cannot make it so that it is wilderness there
I think a main reason for this is because in this area that is clearly not godwars, it has the godwars killcount thing in the upper corner, i am not entirely sure, but i think thats what the problem is.
If anyone could either A, tell me how to make the freaking wilderness work, or B, tell me how to get rid of the godwars killcount in this certain area, it would be greatly appreciated.

(sorry, im new to the 667&#39;s and what not)</description>
