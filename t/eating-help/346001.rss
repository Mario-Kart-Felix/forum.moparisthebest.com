    <description>Ok.. This is kinda weird. On my server the max levels are 150.  Lets say your hitpoints are 99/150 and you eat a manta ray, now you have 124hits.  You eat another manta ray, and your HP doesn&#39;t go back up.. This happens to me for every number over 100.  Say ur Hp is 76.. you eat a manta and you have 101.  You eat again, and it stays 101.. Anyone know how to fix this?  Manta&#39;s wont heal you if your Hits are over 100.</description>
