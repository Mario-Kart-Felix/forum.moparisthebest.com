    <title>Objects duplicating?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/objects-duplicating/127610</link>
    <description>I am running fr33sc4p3 pkz and to add objects i use the addaobject(x coord, y coord, object id, 10 (so it knows it ain&#39;t a door or wall), rotation(which way it faces)) and when i do that the objects get duplicated in random places, like my entire training room in varrock is sited in far wildy, south of seers, at ::con, recruitment drive quest room, and more. I am wondering if there is a different method besides addaobject like i&#39;ve heard of makeglobalobject or something but i do addaobject cause it was already in the fr33sc4p3 source.</description>
