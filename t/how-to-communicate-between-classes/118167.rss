    <title>How to communicate between classes?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-communicate-between-classes/118167</link>
    <description>Hi,

I&#39;ve got a problem, i want to make player.java (class) give the player 1 agility experience when running, for each % the player ran.

Player.java -&gt; Client.java
The problem is, that i dont know how to communicate betweem the two calsses.

I&#39;ve tried server.clientHandler.addSkillXP(...);
also tried just addSkillXP(...)
Tried a few more ways, but neither of them worked.
How do i do this?

I&#39;m able to use player.java from client.java, but not vice versa.

Any ideas?</description>
