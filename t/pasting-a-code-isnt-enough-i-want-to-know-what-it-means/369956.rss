    <description>Hello,
My name is Shawn. Introduced to RSPS&#39;s by my good friend Corey about a month ago. For the past month I&#39;ve basically looked for a source that i could basically leech, which I&#39;m here to change because learning how to code java would be accomplishment in my live which could ultimately give me some confidence.  Now Source wise I have no idea what to start with. I saw a comment by a user named I Vain I to use Hyperion, I think is the name. So I downloaded it, and had no idea where to start and saw that no tut&#39;s were really made on a basic of this so i then heard about delta&#39;s and PI&#39;s and 474&#39;s. I understand the difference&#39;s now. (sorta :P) Anyway now that i see most of the most experienced people coding Java use bases like Hyperion, I&#39;m thinking i should start on a delta.

      Now, obviously i could download a source with already made god sword&#39;s, claws, a stable (for delta) source..etc..But to me that&#39;s not good enough. And if i got a blank source i could easily ask people on here a for a Claw Gfx(i think thats what it&#39;s called) spec and emote. But i want to understand and learn how to build such codes on my own. Onto my questions.
 
-Q1 As a beginner, Should i use delta?
-Q2 How do you begin to create codes which make your character to motions like the AGS special attack? (for example, How does a code make Java know to make your character jump in the air and do a full spin)?
-Q3 People say you need to &quot;add models&quot; for claws or customs (spirit shields for example) I don&#39;t see a picture or anything in the sprites folders of deltas..So again how does a code suddenly create a item? 
-Q4 how do you make a source more stable? Is it just the computer you run on? I&#39;m on a i5 preprocessor so if thats the case i shouldn&#39;t have a problem

Obviously..To many Java experts this is pocket change information, But if you&#39;d be kind enough to share that information it would be greatly appreciated! Thank You! (sorry if any grammar was wrong, typed this extremely quick)</description>

<p>Ahhh maybe you are correct in the fact I’m a bit under educated in the way of server making creation. I’m going to take your heed and Learn what i can from the site you have provided. Honestly I’m going by what I heard once “if there’s a will there’s a way” Have you any other resources or advice that i might be able to make use of? I’ve very eager to learn and grow in the rsps community.</p>

<p>Honestly, if you want to understand how these work, start smaller.

If this is still too difficult, I advise staying away from here, until you have read some (e-)books and have a better understanding of how Java, and programming in general, works.</p>
