    <title>VIP title</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vip-title/432250</link>
    <description>As people seem to want it back I figured I would create a discussion topic about it. If you read:

http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,532890.msg3910920.html

You&#39;ll see I&#39;m against the adding of such a title (again), but obviously it&#39;s best to get other opinions on the subject before ruling it out completely. Though I&#39;d like to stress, if it turns out to be popular opinion wise and does get added again the standard you must reach to obtain it must be heightened significantly. 

For those who are unaware of what the VIP title was, allow me to explain: Basically it was a title ingame which granted the user a green name the specification for it was basically who was the most supportive/active/and helpful.</description>
