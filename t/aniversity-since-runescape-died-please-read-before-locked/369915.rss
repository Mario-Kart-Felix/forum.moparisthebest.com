    <description>for all of you people out there whos souls was broken on december 10th 2005 when runescape was ruined, well i gottah thank mopar they started this hudge project reminding us what we should fight for! these brave people and the brave staff of mopar should go in the history books because they showed us what to stand up for and what to belive.

so all i ask is all members go on runescape world 1 and go to fallador square (the place runescape died) and spam the shit out of jagex, lets stand up for what we belive
so on dec 10th 2010 do this for us, we show jagex what real loyal members can do
