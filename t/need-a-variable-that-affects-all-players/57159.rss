    <title>Need a variable that affects ALL players</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-variable-that-affects-all-players/57159</link>
    <description>I want to make a command that kills everyone on the server after a 10 second delay. So far I have -

else if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;nuke&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Dakota&quot;))
			{
		PlayerHandler.messageToAll = (&quot;Nuclear Bomb Going Off In 10 Seconds&quot;);
		[glow=red,2,300]PlayerHandler.affectAllPlayers = true;[/glow]  &lt; obviously doesn&#39;t exist, but I need something that does the same thing as this would do.
		NewHP = 0;
			}


It needs to ~
Be set off by - else if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;nuke&quot;)
Only I can do it - &amp;&amp; playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Dakota&quot;))
Needs to give everyone a 10 second warning - PlayerHandler.messageToAll = (&quot;Nuclear Bomb Going Off In 10 Seconds&quot;);
Need to make it have a 10 second delay - need this code
Affects all players - need this code
Kills them all - NewHP = 0;

I believe this is in the right section. If not please move it. Any help appreciated!</description>
