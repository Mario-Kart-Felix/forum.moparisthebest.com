    <title>PK anywhere</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-anywhere/549381</link>
    <description>So have any of you guys ever played a private server where it uses the regular runescape world but pking is possible anywhere?(like the pvp worlds on osrs) I have played a few like that and would like to include it in the 317 server I am working on. I was wondering how hard/if there is a tutorial on how to implement this into your server.

I hope this was clear to understand and any help is highly appreciated.</description>

              <p>That’s saying the client is null and it’s dc’ing them. I still don’t see how that’s related to the inWild boolean.</p>
<p>Check your initialize method which should be found in the Client.java<br>
See if it has anything related to checking if the player is in the wild or not.</p>

              <p>Hey man I really appreciate your help, it means a lot. I ran into a error unfortunately. there was several public boolean in wild, but I assumed you meant to edit the one with all the coordinates. I did as you said and both the source and client compiled without error but now when I log it gives the black screen “connection lost, attempting to reestablish”</p>
<p>Got any clue what the problem is?</p>

<p>What it is im trying to do is make it where you can pvp anywhere except banks like you see in some of the pking servers out there, except it would be in a normal economy based server.</p>
