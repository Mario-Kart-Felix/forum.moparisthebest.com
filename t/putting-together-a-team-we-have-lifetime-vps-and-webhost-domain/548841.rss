INTRO:
[SPOILER=Intro]Adrenaline_Ltd has been in development since 2012 and has kept it going for some reason. We strive to bring players amazing content that&#39;s never been seen before!
Adrenaline has a privately owned VPS (Virtual Private Server) currently running in our Lead Developers basement, So our server will always be online no matter what.
Our Lead Developer is Vegas, He handles our security for the server/website/forums/VPS (penetration tester)
our Team Administrator is Steele, He&#39;s our creative thinker, And keeps our team on track and working hard.
And our amazing Owner, The one who started Adrenaline in 2012 is Jonathan, All ideas and work must pass through him (steele and vegas too) before implementing it anywhere, This is just to make sure that it is not something that will be under-used or forgotten, And so that we know what exactly is in our server.
BEST OF ALL! We try not leech any work by other developers, Meaning you write your own code and add your author tags[/SPOILER]

DEVELOPERS NEEDED:
[SPOILER=DEVELOPERS NEEDED]GFX designer
Source + Client developer ~ either or
website/forums developer ~ must know how to add highscores and stuff like that
Creative thinkers[/SPOILER]

SERVER CONTENT:
[SPOILER=CONTENT]Vorago
Clean cache ~ removed thousands of useless sprites
No black screen ~ 90% of the time, when someone gets black screened it only lasts a few second or up to 3 minutes and 40 seconds max
Teleport activation
Squeal of Fortune
100% Grand Exchange
started custom starter tutorial ~ Finished, just have to figure out why it doesn&#39;t work
Christmas Cracker
Started party room
fight caves
fight kiln ~ have to figure out why it doesn&#39;t let you through the entrance
duel arena

Thats all the content for now until we get our project running smoothly[/SPOILER]

IMAGES:
