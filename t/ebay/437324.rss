    <description>So im using Ebay for my first time. I&#39;m trying to sell my IPhone 4s. Basically I just made my Ebay account, got everything set up, put the Iphone up for sale. About 15 minutes after I set it up for sale, i received a message from Ebay saying my account is restricted and my listings have been removed. But does not say why, just to contact them, which I can&#39;t do until between 5am and 10pm pacific apparently. 

Did I do something wrong? Just sort of need some input on whats going on. I&#39;ve never used Ebay, not familiar with it what so ever. 

Thanks in advance
