    <description>okkkkkk ive been asking this for awile b.c i cant effin find this out!@!#@@#!@

im using delta and try to make corp beast hit everyone in a  general area, here is my code im using right now (works but doesnt hit everyone, just single)

[code]						} else if(npcs[NPCID].npcType == 2705 &amp;&amp; misc.random(4)==1) {
for (Player p : server.playerHandler.players) {//loop so it effects all players
        client person = (client)p;
if(p != null &amp;&amp; person.distanceToPoint(EnemyX, EnemyY) &lt;= 20) {
plr.specGFX(396);
hitDiff = 30 + misc.random(25);}
}			[/code]

if anyone can tell me what&#39;s wrong in this and what to change it would help ALOT, although i ki nda know te problem, im using distance to point whihci believe is the problem seeming it&#39;s not to a point, itin the general area from the beast. as you can see i was trying to make it mean , if player is in enemyx/y 20 spaces , it would get hit a 30, this was the basic copy from heal all spell in lunar, just instead i added the hitDiff and the top part, i leeched ffrom a different code above.

btw this is the npchandler, if yu neded to know
anyone help would be nice :)</description>
