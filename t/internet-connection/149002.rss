    <description>Please help!Well my internet connection seems so slow lately..I am on a dlink router..and it seems whenever my brother is downloading and such it slows my internet down tremendously..and if I play x-box live it lags alot.Well I was wondering how to limit it and such without him knowing?I am not sure if he is downloading..but believe so.Isp = Shaw cable high speed.

Also in my network connections theres two..one is called like 1392 adapter or such and is speed : 400mpbs this one does nothing..no recieving or sending packets.Other one which is Lan and is working is at speed 100mpbs..wondering if I can benifet with the other one?Also I do have a wireless linksys router that is not hooked up,should I hook it up and such?

Please and thanks.

Mainly trying to fix my lag issue on x-box live.</description>
