    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-when-i-make-myself-admin-or-mod/408761</link>
    <description>FIXED

So when i go into mainsave and click my user change the 0 to a 2 for admin. Then i try log back and im starting at the beginning all over again. So it kept having i tried with different users but then i went into the login java file and made it so when i logged in with that user it would auto give me admin but it does not work no changes to my accounts.
