    <title>[562] How to fix No-Clipping, enable combat, and spawning rights. [562]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-how-to-fix-no-clipping-enable-combat-and-spawning-rights-562/356784</link>
    <description>I am currently using the Corruptionx 562 Source to create my first 562. A few problems have been ocuring, first of all please tell me if this is in wrong forum section. 1. Character walks through walls, and I need to know how to fix no clipping. 2. I currently cannot engage in combat with anything else, (npc, other player, etc). 3. I made myself Administrator, (Owner) and when I try to spawn items a message pops up saying, &quot;You need to gain more trust before spawning items&quot;. I need some help and will give staff on my server for first person that helps. All 3 problems=Head Admin, 2 problems=Admin, 1 problem=Mod.

Thanks.</description>

              <p>well i dont know anything aout 562’s but on 317’s the problem with npc’s no clipping is by making them walk. i forgot how but u go to something in the npcs and change it to 0 instead of one. this will make your npc stationary. problem solved  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
