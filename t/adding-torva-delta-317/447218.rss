    <title>Adding Torva (Delta 317)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-torva-delta-317/447218</link>
    <description>Yes, it&#39;s Delta don&#39;t hate.

I&#39;m trying to add Torva to my server but I&#39;ve got to the point where I can add the models but when I compile and restart it still doesn&#39;t work. Here&#39;s a list of things I&#39;ve done. (Procedure)

Added models to model folder
Added correct ints with good inventory model to class8.java
Added correct Torva stats into Item.cfg in source
Added the correct &quot;wearing&quot; to Item.java
Compiled with no Errors
Logged in added models recompiled both
Logged in tried to pickup (I get Paintings)
The item numbers are within 8,000-15,000 (Specifically 8001, 8002, 8003)

I&#39;ve done much more to try to help myself out also, I didn&#39;t even bring it to forums without researching and trying to fix it for 4 hours. Please help I have been working a long time to add this. :)</description>
