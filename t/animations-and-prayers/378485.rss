    <description>Hey,
I&#39;m wondering if someone of you could tell me how to set special animations for Items, and how to set animations for Npcs.
Also, could you please tell me how to give a protect prayer to an Npc? (Like the Kalphite Queen has in many servers).

My server is Delta based.</description>
