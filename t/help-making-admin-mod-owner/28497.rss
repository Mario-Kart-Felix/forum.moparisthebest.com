    <title>Help making admin/mod/owner</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-making-admin-mod-owner/28497</link>
    <description>Ok, I have read the tuts on making accounts admin/owner/mod and whatnot I have followed the exact steps changing the freeslot to the account name and whatnot but....it still doesn&#39;t show the account as a admin/owner/mod.I realize that one of them will not show to you but to others and I have added the code to fix that problem also but....still no crowns and on the start screen it tells me the owners and mods ect. are the same as when I originally downloaded testscape.

Any help please?</description>
