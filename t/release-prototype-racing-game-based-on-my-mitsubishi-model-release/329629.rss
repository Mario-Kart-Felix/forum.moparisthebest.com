    <title>[RELEASE]Prototype Racing Game Based On My Mitsubishi Model[RELEASE]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/release-prototype-racing-game-based-on-my-mitsubishi-model-release/329629</link>
    <description>Alright, as I told some of you before I was working on a new project, well here it is. This is a prototype of a future project. Since I had finished the Mitsubishi, I though why not use it for this. I could use a 50k polygon car but I didn&#39;t since this is just a test. The model is made in 3DS Max, exported to FBX. Then imported in Unity wich is a really great engine that uses the DirectX 9 and OpenGL renderer. I worked all day on this game, the hard part was actully to set up the handling of the car. I tried to make it as realistic as possible and I have to say that I&#39;m happy about the result. You can&#39;t feel the handling in the pictures ofcourse, that&#39;s why I&#39;m also providing a download. That download includes this game, no setup needed. It&#39;s in a zip. Extract the contents in ONE folder and run the Mitsubishi Eclispe 1999 Simulator.exe. Tell me what you think and give some feedback. Oh btw, I setted up the racing track but I didn&#39;t model the trees, chairs,... myself.

Wait I’m confused. Did you make the game or just the model?<br>
[/quote]i made both[/quote]<br>
Sorry, I didn’t mean game, because that is easy shit.<br>
I mean the engine that loads the models.</p>
<p>PS - If you want something more challenging than a rough car, try a human with proper muscles etc</p>

What program did you use? or was it just java script?[/quote]err i can tell you, making this game was really hard, and I’m really good with computers, modeling and almost all other 3d graphics so thats means no good, i don’t think you will be ever capable to make sucha game, but how did i start?  start with small things, model things, swords etc etc, then start modeling on a little higer level then higer and higer then start to learn animating, after u cn animate almost 100% start learning basic languages like javascript, etc and if you know enough you can throw al your knowledge together and make something like this</p>
<p>I used 3DS Max to model this its a 4000 dollar porgram but just go and crack it<br>
and I used the unity engine to throw everything together.</p>
