    <description>Hey mopar, for the people that don&#39;t like that message, can you add a Get[&#39;agree&#39;] on that page so that we can go to the forums using a bookmark without having to type anything in, but we would still be agreeing to the document. 

Such as ...

http://www.moparisthebest.com/agreement.php?agree=yes

Would be much easier. :)</description>

              <p>Mopar, I think that if jagex was going to try and take down the website, they would have gotten away with it by now. Have you had any legal threats yet? Or, for that matter any REAL legal threats? I bet a lot of noobs send you emails with their leet php hax to make it look like it’s coming from jagex. Kait said he used to get several of them a day.</p>
<p>Either way, typing yes isn’t too big of a deal at all. Ron, just clear your cookies less often? Or just stop looking at so much porn that you need to clear your cookies each day <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Yeah I wouldn’t be typing it in everytime. It would be bookmarked. Like right now <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a> is bookmarked and I have firefox to automatically delete cookies everytime I exit the browser. And everytime people go to that address plus agree=yes, then they would automatically say that they agree to those terms everytime. This would just be a faster and much easier approach. It’s not bothering me <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> much, but on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being not bothering me at all, and 10 being I would kill myself if I see that fuckin page again) I would give it a 6.</p>
<p>Just a request. So how about it Mopar, could you implement it for not just me but for everyone experiencing the same or higher magnitude of frustration? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
