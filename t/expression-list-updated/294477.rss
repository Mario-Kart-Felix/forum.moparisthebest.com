    <title>Expression List {UPDATED}</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/expression-list-updated/294477</link>
    <description>There is no server discussion or contributions or just lists board (They have one on run3-locus XD)

So I thought I would post it here.

Im trying to make a list for the facial expressions you can have during dialogue.

At the moment I only have player ones here ismy current list:
[code]
588 - Raises eyebrows
589 - Looks like he feels sorry about something (Talks for ages)
590 - Less sorry than before then raises eyebrows then looks away ashamed
quite a few times. (Doesn&#39;t stop looking away ashamed(on loop))
591 - looks away ashamed raises eyebrows, looks to right
592 - Looks pissed off, ruins effect by going crosseyed at the end XD
593 - Looks very serious with slight anger, towards end angrier
594 - Kind of evil looking, think its meant to be happy
595 - Slightly happier than evil this time. (Might have something to do
with my pink eyebrows)
596 - Both eyebrows raised up, remorse/guilt maybe sorrow
597 - Same again this time looks like apologising or breaking bad news
to someone.
598 - Same as above basically slight differences.
599 - Again same as above this one looks abit more guilty/hopeless/at 
a loss as what to do.
600 - Looking sly, towards end eyebrows and eyes look really weird
601 - Looks like he is trying to work something out?
602 - Same as above
603 - Same as above
604 - Just epically angry looking. Doesnt even say anything.
605 - Laughing
606 - Yawning or laughing. Turns into hyperventalaiting
607 - Gasping for breath/laughing/most epic yawn ever
608 - Why so many laughing/yawning expressions?
609 - EVIL LAUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
610 - Very scared/at the point of tears
611 - Same again
612 - OMG HOW MANY GODDAM SAD FACES THEY NEED
613 - If 614 is another sad face imma be pissed
614 - WEWT VERY ANGRY LOOKS LIKE HE GONNA KICK A CAT!
615 - I think this is angry
616 - Evil but thinking then angry then sad then angry
617 - Angry, sad, angry, eyebrows raised[/code]

After emote 617 they look really screwed up.

I worked all them out 100% myself. Feel free to post the ones you know and if you want  to help here is the command to make them.

(This is for iClarity)
[code]		if (command.startsWith(&quot;testingface&quot;) &amp;&amp; p.playerRights == 3) {
			String[] args = command.split(&quot; &quot;);
			int e = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
			p.pDialogue(&quot;Test&quot;, e);
		}[/code]

On Delta its:

[code]		if (command.startsWith(&quot;testingface&quot;) &amp;&amp; p.playerRights == 3) {
			String[] args = command.split(&quot; &quot;);
			int e = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
			talk(&quot;Test&quot;, e);
		}[/code]

I think?

Anyway please contribute.</description>
