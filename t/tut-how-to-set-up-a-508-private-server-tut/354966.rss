    <title>[TUT] How to set-up a *508* private server! [TUT]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-how-to-set-up-a-508-private-server-tut/354966</link>
    <description>OK, this is a basic tutorial on setting up a RuneScape 508 private server. Here are the main parts:


[ul][li][b]CHAPTER 1:[/b] Getting the required programs and files[/li]
[li][b]CHAPTER 2:[/b] Setting up your ports and IP address[/li]
[li][b]CHAPTER 3:[/b] Setting up JRE &amp; JDK[/li]
[li][b]CHAPTER 4:[/b] Setting up your source and client[/li]
[li][b]CHAPTER 5:[/b] The Mini FAQ [/li][/ul]


[i][b]&gt;&gt; CHAPTER 1: Getting the required programs and files[/b][/i]


[ul][li][url=http://uppit.com/v/LMCN4XW5]MithScape Source[/url][/li]
[li][url=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=YY0CPPZ1]508 IP-Changer Client[/url][/li]
[li][url=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk6-jsp-136632.html]JDK 6u21[/url][/li]
[li][url=https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=jre-6u21-oth-JPR@CDS-CDS_Developer]JRE 6u21[/url][/li]
[li][url=http://uppit.com/lrqebg2a3p7j/Kate&#39;s_508_Cache.rar]A 508 Cache[/url][/li][/ul]


[b]C1a:[/b] Download the MithScape source and 508 client first. 
[b]C1b:[/b] Now, on both JDK and JRE, IF you have a 64-bit operating system, MAKE SURE you download choosing the option Windows x64, when it asks, NOT Windows. If you have a 32-bit operating system, choose Windows. For any other operating system, choose the required one on the list. You must make sure you do this, otherwise If you do not download it correctly, you will have problems running the client!

[i][b]&gt;&gt; CHAPTER 2: Setting up your ports and IP Address[/b][/i]

[b]PORTFORWARDNG:[/b] 
[b]C2a[/b] Go onto Start, then in the search bar, type in CMD. Open it. For non-vista users, go onto Accessories, find the Run program. In the text bar, put in CMD, and press enter. It should open up.
[b]C2b[/b] I want you to type this in the CMD box: [i]ipconfig /all[/i] - [b]Do not[/b] put a space before the command!
[b]C2c[/b] Now find your Gateway IP. in the [b]Wireless LAN Adapter Wireless Network Connection[/b] section.
[b]C2d[/b] Put this IP into your address bar, with no [i]http://[/i], and it may prompt your for a username and password. Either use:

[ul][li]User: admin - Pass: Admin[/li]
[li]User: admin - Pass: Password[/li]
[li]User: admin - No password[/li]
[li]For sky users; user: admin - pass: sky[/li][/ul]

[b]C2e[/b] Once your on the page, for Belkin routers, find Virtual Servers, and for Netgear, find Portforward/Porttriggering. The names will be similar to the ones on the router pages of your own routers. These are [b]NOT[/b] exact names!
[b]C2f[/b] On the first port slot, put 43594. On the second port slot, put 43594. Change it to TCP/UDP. Go to portforward.com, and download the PF Checker! Open it once installed, and look at the IP on the program which it displays. This is one of your IP&#39;s! Look at the end digit, and put that into the slot when it asks for your IP. Name it RSPS, or whatever you like, and Check Enable, or just Apply.
[b]C2g[/b] Now I want you to access your firewall, and allow a program through firewall. But instead, allow a port. Put in 43594, and check TCP. 
[IMG]http://i778.photobucket.com/albums/yy64/Femalescape/Port.png[/img]

[b]GETTING A IP ADDRESS:[/b]
[b]C2a[/b] Go to [url=http://no-ip.com/]No-IP[/url] and make an account, verify it
[b]C2b[/b] Now click on Hosts/Redirects
[b]C2c[/b] On that, click Add a Host
[b]C2d[/b] For the IP address, name it whatever you like. For example, my server is CarnageX, so I type in the text bar, &quot;carnagex&quot;. Choose a domain from the drop list, from the FREE section, unless you want to pay. Just click Create Host!
 [IMG]http://i778.photobucket.com/albums/yy64/Femalescape/IP.png[/img]

Now you have done that, download the [url=https://www.no-ip.com/downloads.php]No-IP Duc[/url]. Once installed, open it up. Log in using your e-mail address and password you used to log in on No-Ip.  It will be on your icon tray. Just click on the icon, and click on Show to open it&#39;s client. Now, make sure No-IP is still open your browser, so It can search for your IP Address. Check your IP Address on the client! A smiley face should appear, and all is well.

[i][b]&gt;&gt; CHAPTER 3: Setting up JRE &amp; JDK[/b][/i]

[b]C3a[/b] Firstly, install JDK. If it prompts you to restart, [b]do not[/b].
[b]C3b[/b] Now, install JRE. If it prompts you to restart, go ahead!

Make sure they have been properly installed. You can do this by going onto My Computer, then into your C:/ directory, then look into Program Files. For Windows 7 users, go into Program Files (x86). Then if you double-click on the Java folder, you will notice inside are all your JDK versions, and of course, all your jre folders. Look for the jre6 folder. If it is there, this tells us that JDK and JRE, have been properly installed.

[i][b]&gt;&gt; CHAPTER 4: Setting up your source and client[/b][/i]

Firstly, you will want to extract the Cache folder to the desktop. Open &quot;Kate&#39;s 508 Cache&quot;. Inside a folder called &quot;cache508&quot; should be there. If not, you have not extracted all of the Cache folder! Now, click on cache508, and right-click. Click onto cut, and paste it in My Computer, OS or the C:/ drive. Your done with that!

Second of all, on the MithScape Source, you will find the run.bat file in the folder CMD. Open up that folder, and double-click run. Now you have the server running! Make sure your No-IP Duc is running at all times, and your IP is checked in the client. If you want to minimize it into the icon tray, simply click the miniture x on the client, it won&#39;t fully exit it, unless you right-click &gt; exit it on the icon tray. 

So, load up the 508 client. On the start of the client, it will prompt you for an IP, before anything loads. Put in your server IP address! e.g - carnagex.no-ip.info. Put in [b]YOURS[/b]. Now, once you press Enter, it should load up. If it waits on Connecting to Server, that means your server is offline. To make it online, double-click run.bat in the cmd folder, as explained above.

Log into your server with a chosen username and password. You will appear in edgeville. Now, log out of your server. You have just created your character file found in the Characters folder. So, your the owner right.. And you want to be the official owner? You could easily make yourself admin in the Character folder, by opening up your file, and on the rights section, replacing the number 0 with 2. 2= Admin, 1=Mod. No, you don&#39;t want to do that quite yet. Instead, you want to make yourself the OFFICIAL owner! You must go into the SRC folder. Then, go into the io folder. There, you should find a class file. Right-click and Edit on the Login.java file. Go onto Edit in Notepad, and click Find. In the text bar, put in &quot;rights&quot;, without quotes. It should appear like this:

[IMG]http://i778.photobucket.com/albums/yy64/Femalescape/Rights.png[/img] 

Once you have found it, you should see the username Whiz. Change Whiz to the username you logged into your server with. Like this: (&quot;Whiz&quot;) to (&quot;Kate&quot;), for example. Make sure you do not touch any of the quotes or brackets, otherwise you may mess your server up! Save it. 

Now, I want you to go back to the entry point of MithScape, where you see the 3 folders: cmd, src, and bin. I then want you to go into CMD, and run the Build palidino76.rs2.io batch file. If it does not work, look into the Miniture FAQ section at the bottom of this thread. Wait for it to finish compiling the character files, that is why it is there. Press any key to continue should appear, do just that. Now you can log back in, and you will have the administrators crown icon, with the rights of a owner!

Ok then, so if the following has not worked: Compile.bat, Run.bat or even Build palidino76.rs2.io.bat, please look at the Miniture FAQ section.

I hope you understood my tutorial, and have an excellent and popular private server! Good luck!

[i][b]&gt;&gt; Miniture FAQ - For the newbies and dummies &lt;&lt;[/b][/i]

[b]Run.bat will not work![/b]

Unfortunetly, I cannot assist you with an answer. Search the forums, or use another Run.bat from a different 508 source that works.

[b]Compile.bat will not work![/b]

Open it up. Where you have the JDK version, change the 6.0_(version number), to 6.0_21, then it should work! For Windows 7 users, make sure the [i]/Program Files/[/i] is [i]/Program Files (x86)/[/i], then it should work.

[b]Build palidino76.rs2.io.bat will not work![/b]

Do the same thing for what you must do to get Compile.bat to work If it does not.

[b]The client will not work![/b]

The client should work, as it does for me. Make sure you have the latest JDK and JRE installed. Other than that, you may have not extracted ALL of the files onto your desktop. If you have edited the client, that is why. If it still does not work, try getting Java, if you have not! You should though, otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be able to play RS2. If you have all of these, and It still does not work, unfortunetly I cannot assist you. Unless, you downloaded JDK and JRE choosing the Windows option instead of Windows x64, If you have a 64-bit operating system.

[b]Credits[/b]


[ul][li]50% Whiz - For MithScape 508, and the link to the 508 client.[/li]
[li]50% Me - For the 508 cache, Java download links, and tutorial.[/li][/ul]


The reason I give half percentage of credits to Whiz, is because If I had not put a source and client download into the tutorial, half of you would not know where to get one, set it up, or even really have a private server to run. So I thank Whiz for the source and client to use for newbies.</description>

<p>And I can’t find the Run.bat file in the CMD folder, so I just click the initiate.bat one.<br>
Please help. :([/quote]</p>
<p>Initiate = run.bat - your running the server right. Did you portforward correctly? Maybe your ports are blocked, in which you must add to your firewall, or the last digit of your IP is wrong when portforwarding ports. BTW, do you have a router? Portforwarding is only necessary for users with routers.</p>

If you were to just follow a 317 private server tutorial in order to make a 508, your server would not work at all. You need a cache in your OS directory, plus, you can’t log on with a 317 client, can you?  But other than that, I suppose.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t really help either, If I just said: Look, go find a 317 tutorial, but download this cache and client instead, and put your rights as 2 for owner instead of 3. :P[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m more than aware of that, as I was stating, you can set up a 508 server using the “317 method”, and as you said in your post you must have a cache in your OS, it’s not hard to download a client and a cache.</p>

You must make sure you do this, otherwise If you do not download it correctly, you will have problems running the client!<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">&gt;&gt; CHAPTER 2: Setting up your ports and IP Address</span></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PORTFORWARDNG:</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">C2a</span> Go onto Start, then in the search bar, type in CMD. Open it. For non-vista users, go onto Accessories, find the Run program. In the text bar, put in CMD, and press enter. It should open up.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">C2b</span> I want you to type this in the CMD box: <span class="bbcode-i">ipconfig /all</span> - <span class="bbcode-b">Do not</span> put a space before the command!<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">C2c</span> Now find your Gateway IP. in the <span class="bbcode-b">Wireless LAN Adapter Wireless Network Connection</span> section.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">C2d</span> Put this IP into your address bar, with no <span class="bbcode-i">http://</span>, and it may prompt your for a username and password. Either use:</p>
<p>[ul][li]User: admin - Pass: Admin[/li]<br>
[li]User: admin - Pass: Password[/li]<br>
[li]User: admin - No password[/li]<br>
[li]For sky users; user: admin - pass: sky[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">C2e</span> Once your on the page, for Belkin routers, find Virtual Servers, and for Netgear, find Portforward/Porttriggering. The names will be similar to the ones on the router pages of your own routers. These are <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> exact names!<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">C2f</span> On the first port slot, put 43594. On the second port slot, put 43594. Change it to TCP/UDP. Go to <a href="http://portforward.com" rel="nofollow noopener">portforward.com</a>, and download the PF Checker! Open it once installed, and look at the IP on the program which it displays. This is one of your IP’s! Look at the end digit, and put that into the slot when it asks for your IP. Name it RSPS, or whatever you like, and Check Enable, or just Apply.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">C2g</span> Now I want you to access your firewall, and allow a program through firewall. But instead, allow a port. Put in 43594, and check TCP.<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">GETTING A IP ADDRESS:</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">C2a</span> Go to <a href="http://no-ip.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">No-IP</a> and make an account, verify it<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">C2b</span> Now click on Hosts/Redirects<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">C2c</span> On that, click Add a Host<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">C2d</span> For the IP address, name it whatever you like. For example, my server is CarnageX, so I type in the text bar, “carnagex”. Choose a domain from the drop list, from the FREE section, unless you want to pay. Just click Create Host!<br>

</div></a></div></p>
<p>Now you have done that, download the <a href="https://www.no-ip.com/downloads.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">No-IP Duc</a>. Once installed, open it up. Log in using your e-mail address and password you used to log in on No-Ip.  It will be on your icon tray. Just click on the icon, and click on Show to open it’s client. Now, make sure No-IP is still open your browser, so It can search for your IP Address. Check your IP Address on the client! A smiley face should appear, and all is well.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">&gt;&gt; CHAPTER 3: Setting up JRE &amp; JDK</span></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">C3a</span> Firstly, install JDK. If it prompts you to restart, <span class="bbcode-b">do not</span>.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">C3b</span> Now, install JRE. If it prompts you to restart, go ahead!</p>
<p>Make sure they have been properly installed. You can do this by going onto My Computer, then into your C:/ directory, then look into Program Files. For Windows 7 users, go into Program Files (x86). Then if you double-click on the Java folder, you will notice inside are all your JDK versions, and of course, all your jre folders. Look for the jre6 folder. If it is there, this tells us that JDK and JRE, have been properly installed.<br>
<img src="http://i778.photobucket.com/albums/yy64/Femalescape/Java.png" alt width="391" height="471"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">&gt;&gt; CHAPTER 4: Setting up your source and client</span></span></p>
<p>Firstly, you will want to extract the Cache folder to the desktop. Open “Kate’s 508 Cache”. Inside a folder called “cache508” should be there. If not, you have not extracted all of the Cache folder! Now, click on cache508, and right-click. Click onto cut, and paste it in My Computer, OS or the C:/ drive. Your done with that!</p>
<p>Second of all, on the MithScape Source, you will find the run.bat file in the folder CMD. Open up that folder, and double-click run. Now you have the server running! Make sure your No-IP Duc is running at all times, and your IP is checked in the client. If you want to minimize it into the icon tray, simply click the miniture x on the client, it won’t fully exit it, unless you right-click &gt; exit it on the icon tray.</p>
<p>So, load up the 508 client. On the start of the client, it will prompt you for an IP, before anything loads. Put in your server IP address! e.g - carnagex.no-ip.info. Put in <span class="bbcode-b">YOURS</span>. Now, once you press Enter, it should load up. If it waits on Connecting to Server, that means your server is offline. To make it online, double-click run.bat in the cmd folder, as explained above.</p>
<p>Log into your server with a chosen username and password. You will appear in edgeville. Now, log out of your server. You have just created your character file found in the Characters folder. So, your the owner right… And you want to be the official owner? You could easily make yourself admin in the Character folder, by opening up your file, and on the rights section, replacing the number 0 with 2. 2= Admin, 1=Mod. No, you don’t want to do that quite yet. Instead, you want to make yourself the OFFICIAL owner! You must go into the SRC folder. Then, go into the io folder. There, you should find a class file. Right-click and Edit on the Login.java file. Go onto Edit in Notepad, and click Find. In the text bar, put in “rights”, without quotes. It should appear like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i778.photobucket.com/albums/yy64/Femalescape/Rights.png" alt width="557" height="314"></p>
<p>Once you have found it, you should see the username Whiz. Change Whiz to the username you logged into your server with. Like this: (“Whiz”) to (“Kate”), for example. Make sure you do not touch any of the quotes or brackets, otherwise you may mess your server up! Save it.</p>
<p>Now, I want you to go back to the entry point of MithScape, where you see the 3 folders: cmd, src, and bin. I then want you to go into CMD, and run the Build <a href="http://palidino76.rs2.io" rel="nofollow noopener">palidino76.rs2.io</a> batch file. If it does not work, look into the Miniture FAQ section at the bottom of this thread. Wait for it to finish compiling the character files, that is why it is there. Press any key to continue should appear, do just that. Now you can log back in, and you will have the administrators crown icon, with the rights of a owner!</p>
<p>Ok then, so if the following has not worked: Compile.bat, Run.bat or even Build palidino76.rs2.io.bat, please look at the Miniture FAQ section.</p>
<p>I hope you understood my tutorial, and have an excellent and popular private server! Good luck!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">&gt;&gt; Miniture FAQ - For the newbies and dummies &lt;&lt;</span></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Run.bat will not work!</span></p>
<p>Unfortunetly, I cannot assist you with an answer. Search the forums, or use another Run.bat from a different 508 source that works.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Compile.bat will not work!</span></p>
<p>Open it up. Where you have the JDK version, change the 6.0_(version number), to 6.0_21, then it should work! For Windows 7 users, make sure the <span class="bbcode-i">/Program Files/</span> is <span class="bbcode-i">/Program Files (x86)/</span>, then it should work.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Build palidino76.rs2.io.bat will not work!</span></p>
<p>Do the same thing for what you must do to get Compile.bat to work If it does not.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The client will not work!</span></p>
<p>The client should work, as it does for me. Make sure you have the latest JDK and JRE installed. Other than that, you may have not extracted ALL of the files onto your desktop. If you have edited the client, that is why. If it still does not work, try getting Java, if you have not! You should though, otherwise you wouldn’t be able to play RS2. If you have all of these, and It still does not work, unfortunetly I cannot assist you. Unless, you downloaded JDK and JRE choosing the Windows option instead of Windows x64, If you have a 64-bit operating system.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Credits</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]50% Whiz - For MithScape 508, and the link to the 508 client.[/li]<br>
[li]50% Me - For the 508 cache, Java download links, and tutorial.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The reason I give half percentage of credits to Whiz, is because If I had not put a source and client download into the tutorial, half of you would not know where to get one, set it up, or even really have a private server to run. So I thank Whiz for the source and client to use for newbies.</p>
