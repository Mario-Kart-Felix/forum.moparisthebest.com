    <title>Im desperate... Still that cache error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-desperate-still-that-cache-error/552389</link>
    <description>Hello!

Day 4, still with the cache error... I really don&#39;t know what to do. But i thought about this. What if i just give the cache to the players? So if they go on my website to download the client, they download a folder, and inside there is the client.jar and the ballscapecache, so the client looks for the cache in the same folder where they are. Is that possible? Cause i&#39;m getting tired of this stuff...

I just noticed this: i don&#39;t have a cachedownloader.java and class? The download thingy for the cache is in client.java? Would that be the problem?
