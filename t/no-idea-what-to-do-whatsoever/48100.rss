    <description>Hi, 
Me and my brother have just recently downloaded Moparscape. The sad thing is we have no idea how to make our own server and make it how we like thne play together and let other people on. Sad isn&#39;t it. Sadly we have no idea how to script or anyhing either sooo.....we are pretty much stuck with.....nothing  :eek: It would probably be to much trouble, but if somebody could help us we would appreciate it. We could pay you in RS gold or let you be an admin or higher if you do help us. Or if you play maplestory we could pay you on that lol.</description>
