    <description>dogudez is [url=http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=560359]ezioAU[/url] and [url=http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=560657]yarrak[/url] has a extremely similar IP as [url=http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=559465]yokedici1[/url]. E.G same area. I&#39;ll post/upload some of my pictures tomorrow when I wake up (5am here atm).

Was wondering if someone could look into this forum wise because these guys seem to be making more and more accounts.

Their original names are Spelchure,yokedici1,dogudez all 3 of them joined at the same time.</description>

<p>I understood that but my impression was the fact that they are “close” due to IP and they have similar personalities when playing ingame (or at least, that is my impression)</p>

<p>I don’t believe in banning anyone unless I’m certain they are in breach of the rules, in most cases they’re a group of friends who play together from school, banning them all because of one idiot doesn’t seem very fair.</p>
<p>Honestly, most these people who crop up for me are evading bans from long lengths of time ago so don’t do anything wrong anyway. But if they do they get rebanned anyhow.</p>
