    <description>expected login id 14 from client i keep getting this error or what the hell it is that fills my player list and when it reaches the end boom server freezes and bye bye need to restard server.

this happned to me 2months ago but somehow it stopped but now from one day to another it started again !!!!!

anyone that knows how to fix this if it needs to be fixed

[glow=red,2,300]i&#39;m using project16 v4[/glow] 

dont tell me to change source plz i have been using it with no problems and this just came out again. so theres a soluctiong somewhere.

i Have edited it and it gave me a lot work so im looking for a soluction not to change source.

hope u understanded clearly.

[glow=yellow,2,300]I tried with a clean unchanged project16 v4 to see if the problem was from the stuff i added but theres still the same think thats fills the server up!![/glow]
