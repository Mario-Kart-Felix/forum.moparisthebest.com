    <description>This is another one of my models. I personally think it is my best one, as with this I aimed for more realism instead of how good it looks. 
There are no glitched faces that I know of. If you see one, please point it out. The red/silver is a rusted iron texture. And the blade and inner wings on the hilt are just plain iron textures, but it doesn&#39;t particularly look like a texture. I have posted quite a few pictures to show how the red part along the blade is a bit higher than the blade itself - and how it is also connected to the hilt.

<p>Yeah, I used to code quite a lot. but i gave that up and got into modeling. i tried out Blender and I couldn’t be bothered learning how to use it, so I am just going to stick with Meta. And thanks for your feedback.</p>
<blockquote>NO to the texture, looks terrible, not ur fault tho, blame meta. make handle wider, its like a twig. smoothen out the blade edges, too obviously traced. Something just doesnt look right on it... hmmm, i think its that the hilt is soo wide compared to the length of the handle, you gotta try n balance it out so it looks better. I.E. wide hilts should have long handles so it doesnt look flimsy

<p>Oh and add a pummel<br>
I do liek the diff. levels in the model, its not just a flat sword with an edge so gj there.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot. I will add a pummel soon and upload a few pictures when I do. I thought of making the handle rather long, but I usually get told that the handle is too long when I do that.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the feedback, too. I will add a pummel and smooth out the edges - like you said. And I will replace the pictures when i do.</p>
