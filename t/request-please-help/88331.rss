    <description>I am in request of a logo for a school project.
My project is to design on Publisher, a website that sells stuff.
I chose consoles as a product! =P
I want the logo to be about the same size as a normal sig.
I want it to be with loads of people that are famous in games!
e.g:Super Mario, Ryu etc etc
Thank you for reading this
Please help me.
Thanks,
-Darker-</description>
