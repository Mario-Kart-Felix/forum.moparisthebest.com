    <title>I Got Bored</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-got-bored/37821</link>
    <description>I made a story. Please, read it :P

Finally, a week had passed. Now I was really nervous and scared. Sunday morning came, so I was sitting in my room, curtains closed, door closed. It was pitch black. I was sitting in there gathering all of my thoughts and listening to my iPod, trying to take some of my nerves away. Dad yelled out &quot;Time to go mate, it&#39;s 6(am)&quot; 
As I closed the door, the nerves skyrocketed. I was shaking. The car sped off in a hurry. 

4 hours had passed, and I finally saw a sign saying &quot;Junior Racing, Australian Championships&quot; I had arrived.
Dad and I set up my Pit-Area. Pitching the tent, getting the Eskies and food, etc. 
&quot;Hey, practice starts at 10, I signed you on. Better gear-up&quot; I was told. Now it was time. I slipped my Jersey on, lifted my arms up, slipped my Armour on over my jersey, and pulled my racing pants on over my Under-Legs. Slipped my boots on, buckled them up, slipped my gloves on, put my helmet on, and put my goggles on my handlebars. I began the walk that seemed to take forever to the starting grid. My mechanic by my side wheeling my bike to the staring area. None of us said a word to each other. Except when the riders were let out one by one, he yelled over the sound of little 85 two-strokes, &quot;Good luck Mate, learn the lines, focus on were there&#39;s good passing area. Finally the flags-men pointed at me. I quickly let out my Clutch Lever, and before I knew it, I was out, practicing. I caught a site of my archrival, which was riding the number #109. I&#39;m sure he caught my number #521, and thought to himself, “Here we go again.”
I’ve traded paint, banged-bars every race together with him. I know he&#39;s going to be hauling it, so if I&#39;m going to keep up with him, I&#39;m going to have to ride well.

Well, the red flag came out. Practice was over. I slowly rode my bike back to my pit area, knowing I had an hour before my first race. My mechanic from Yamaha Australia cleaned my bike. I sat down and looked up with my eyes-closed. This was nothing like I have ever felt before. The nerves are horrible. I told him that we need to run Leaner Fuel because my bike wasn&#39;t coming out of the corners harder then it can. So we mixed new fuel, ran less oil and ran it leaner.

&quot;All 85cc riders to the starting grid now please!&quot; announced the siren.
I slipped my helmet on, put my gloves on, got my goggles. This is it. Dad and I walked to the starting grid. Neither of us said a word to each other. He knew I was nervous and had my mind on winning, so he didn&#39;t say anything. He wheeled my bike into my starting grid. I got on my bike, lifted the kick-starter out, and kicked down, and started the bike. All the other riders started their bikes. The sound of 40 little 85’s was loud. Dad started yelling to me to get over the sound of the other Riders Bikes. 
&quot;I can see the first corner. Make sure you get around that first&quot; I put my goggles on, slipped them over my helmet. Show time.

The Thirty Second-board went sideways; all the riders leant forwards on their bike, revving them, knowing the gate is about to drop. I leant over......... The gates dropped, and 40 riders charged into the first corner hard. I was in 4th by the time I came out of the first corner. My archrival and I came out dead in line with each other. He went to take the outside line on the next corner; I took the inside. We came out of the corner tied in position. Neither of us had made any progress on each other. Over a big tabletop together, I reach for a tear-off as I my goggles were covered in dirt. Clean vision. He went the inside on the next corner, I went on the outside, and then turned on the inside, sweeping under him. I passed him finally. Next I was chasing rider #698. We came into a corner, him about 2 meters in front of me. We went through the whoops (The bumps that the riders skim) and we were dead in line with each other. He tried to block me by going from the inside line out, but I swept under him and passed him in the next corner. I was in second. I was coming up to a big 50ft triple. It wasn&#39;t really meant for 85&#39;s, but I knew if I wanted to win, I would have to jump it. He doubled it, and I jumped right over his head. I was in the lead. He came back the next jump, but I went off the jump sideways so my shocks wouldn’t compress and shoot me higher. I stayed lower; it worked, I passed him. 20 Laps past and I had a huge lead. I jumped the finish line knowing I had won the first out of two races. Which gives me a huge chance of winning.

I rode my bike back to Pit-Area, knowing it wasn’t over yet. My mechanic cleaned my bike, I sat and re-hydrated and cooled down. I had 1 hour until the second race, the one that counts.

“Alright then, lets get the second race of the 85cc started” The announcer said over the siren.
Same thing. Pulled on my helmet, slipped my gloves on, got my goggles.
Dad and I walked to the starting-grid this time. Neither of us spoke. He pushed my bike into my starting gate. I got on my bike, lifted the kick-starter out, and pushed it down with my foot. My bike fired to life. The other riders started their bikes. Dad was yelling to get over the sound of the bikes. “Same as always. Get the hole shot, and check-out. Let’s win this thing!”
The 30-second board dropped sideways and the riders lent forwards on the bikes, revving their bikes hard… The gates drop… Down the starting straight we all went. I got a great jump out of the gate. Got out of the first corner in first position!
My archrival beside me, we go over a big Tabletop jump, into a corner dead in line. We come up to the 50ft jump, with experience; I knew I had to try it again. He doubled it, while I jumped right over his head. We went into the whoops, over another 35ft tabletop, into a right berm. We traded places everywhere, until I finally got a good lead. Last corner, and I knew I’d done it…. I was the new Australian Champion, Class A, 85cc Racer. I throw the biggest whipper tail over the last finish line jump.

I walked up to the podium, where I was interviewed. “Wow, you had it going so well out there Kyle” She said “Yeah, I couldn’t of rode today if it wasn’t the help of my parents, and offcourse, Yamaha Australia. They’re just amazing workers. It’s just a dream-come true. I’ve won this before in B Class, but that means nothing compared to A Class.” We stood on the podium, where I was presented my Australian Champion trophy, my archrival next to me; we hugged and congratulated each other. Even though we’ve had ups and downs at times.

I had done it. After 5 years of training, I was the best; and I was still only in 85’s. I’m 12. I wonder what the 125 and the 250 Class bring. That’s for life’s plan to decide.

[b]Note; I took all the criticism in and re-edited it.[/b]</description>

Ohk, IcyPimp, lets put this topic behind us and be friends ok?[br][size=1]Posted at: December 22, 2006, 07:34:04 PM[/size][hr][quote=“Sepranem, post:55, topic:37821”]You were good at trying to setting certain moods into the reader, but there were a few grammar/spelling errors. It definitely shows your love for motocross. A few suggestions besides the spell/grammar errors are to use the words “Dad” and “bike” less, try keeping things from being redundant, and use a bit of higher language. It’s a very good story, but if you used vocabulary that’s just a little more advanced than this it would be a lot better. Also, you might want to find a way to passively describe to the reader what some of the motocross terms are. You shouldn’t make it sound like a definition; just smoothly give them a hint.</p>
<p>All in all a good story. :)[/quote]<br>
Thanks for the constructive criticism. I’ll keep that in note.[br][size=1]Posted at: December 22, 2006, 07:39:03 PM[/size][hr]Ohk, I’ve re-edited.</p>

<p>First of all, you really need to turn your “caps lock” key off. Second, i suggest you go die in a fire. Thirdly, you are very very very stupid, do you think you are a “pimp”? That is just pathetic, That would also implement that you are also a “wigger”.

I don’t say I’m the best, nor is my Dad. We’re far from the best… I have a hobby, an ineffectual<br>
hobby at that. I don’t care what you think IcyPimp. I like talking about Motorbikes… I find it easier to write a story about them because I love them. Exactly why you find coding fun… Because you enjoy it. Now shut up, and leave me alone. I’ll post what I want to post. You post what you want to post, got it?</p>

<p>And being injured and writing something quickly isn’t an excuse for your end-product to be shitty, nobody held a gun to your head and said “Bitch, you better post this shit before you fix the basic spelling and grammar mistakes in it, or I’m going to pop a cap in your ass.”. But don’t worry, your end product is actually (relatively) good.</p>

              <p>Semi-impressed. It’s good, it just needs polish. You should have posted in the writing section, dialogue should always start a new paragraph, some words are used wrong, there are a few minor grammatical errors, you need to find a way to introduce a bit more suspense and pull the reader in, and finally you live in Australia so nobody really cares about you, your family, your friends, your hobbies, or anything thatyou have or will ever achieve.</p>
