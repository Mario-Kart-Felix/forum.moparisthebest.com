<p>That’s lazy bro. How is that giving them a choice if the destination is hard-coded in? What if they don’t have the permissions needed to download your MP3’s to hard-coded folder? Ask anyone running under strict user permissions or vista for that matter, and they would manually have to set them in. If you really wanted to give them a choice, you would let them input the location of the destination.</p>

<p>That’s lazy bro. How is that giving them a choice if the destination is hard-coded in? What if they don’t have the permissions needed to download your MP3’s to hard-coded folder? Ask anyone running under strict user permissions or vista for that matter, and they would manually have to set them in. If you really wanted to give them a choice, you would let them input the location of the destination.</p>

<p>The point of the release wasn’t to make a guaranteed way of playing mp3s, which you and Peter are trying to pretend it is.  So, to cater to your desires I’m telling you how I would do it if I was going to do it how you imagine it.</p>
<p>Essentially, you guys are saying, “That car is shit, it can’t go off-road” about a sports car…  Ya, if you modify it, it will eventually be able to do so.  And what I’ve been doing is explaining how to make a sports car able to go off-road.</p>

<p>The code works perfectly as it’s intended.  If you want to act in a way that it’s a guaranteed download and play, then you have to put in a lot of work, <span class="bbcode-b">because it was not designed to do that</span>.</p>
<p>This is the same principle as UDP vs TCP…  UDP is not guaranteed to reach the destination, but TCP is.  This is the exact same concept, the command is not guaranteed to be completed (and is designed that way).   And you guys are trying to make it so, thus changing it to TCP (which requires a lot more work and resources).  The only difference between this application and analogy of TCP vs UDP is that instead of “speed” it’s resource usage, which can be considered nearly the same thing.</p>
<p>I don’t understand why all of you can’t understand such a simple concept…</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m starting to think <span class="bbcode-u">you’re</span> mentally challenged. What part of what I said suggests that I don’t understand? The code works for the most part. Ok, great. What I’m trying to figure out is, what is the point of releasing code that is generally not acceptable to actually run in an active game environment in its current state?</p>

</aside>
<p>The fact that you don’t understand that the purpose of this is not what you are trying to make it.</p>
<p>And the code works exactly as it was intended, not for the most part.  And you obviously have no real world experience in any software development environment…  I could go on Google, and in about 2 minutes find multiple examples of where this approach has been used in professionally developed games.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>What am I trying to make it into? I’m only asking questions. Take the last question that remains unanswered for example. What is the purpose? I believe the problem here is you haven’t explained this yet.</p>
<p>“For the most part” means: It <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">mainly</span></span> works. Lacking in areas, but works.[/quote]</p>
<p>The last question you asked was an based upon false assumptions, therefore I corrected the assumptions you made.  Asking loaded questions is not a very good tactic to use, and then try and call someone on not answering…</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s obvious that you can’t read, as I have stated that the purpose is to attempt to play a mp3, if the mp3 is not in the cache folder, it attempts to download it.  This is all done in a non-guaranteed way, because it isn’t critical.  You guys are trying to turn it into a guaranteed method to play mp3s, and I have been kind enough to explain how I would make it do that.</p>
<p>As for what, “for the most part” means, I know exactly what it means, and it isn’t lacking in any areas that it’s designed to address, furthermore, your definition is off; based on the context.  What you implied is that the code works in general/usually, when it actually works exactly how it’s suppose to; every single time (because it’s suppose to attempt, and doesn’t matter if it succeeds or not).</p>

<p>You need to read the thread before you post again, because this is getting boring, so wrap it up…[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re assuming that I mean it’s horrible code that cannot be added into the game. I haven’t even implied that; And since I said that no professional programmer would add it in, I cannot see how you can still think I could imply/say that.<br>
Take Peter and The_AFKers reaction to exceptions, and all of that. They had a problem with it not being able to possibly play for every player. THIS is not acceptable, regardless of how it was meant to play when programmed. They wouldn’t see it as “acceptable” in it’s current state, we obviously don’t see it as “acceptable”, so why do you?</p>
<p>Tl;dr doesn’t mean anything of the sort. “Too lazy; Didn’t read” means “I’m getting ‘owned’ and don’t want to read”? Seriously now CodeForFame. Why do you think you’re in some heated argument to where one can lose and one could win (answer this please)?<br>
I couldn’t stay up all night and argue with you. As much as I would like to, I have other obligations and responsibilities (hence why I left it there and went away for hours).</p>
