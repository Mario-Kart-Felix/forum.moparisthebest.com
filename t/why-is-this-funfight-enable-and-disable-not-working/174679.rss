    <title>Why is this funfight enable and disable not working?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-is-this-funfight-enable-and-disable-not-working/174679</link>
    <description>Well, what happens, is someone right clicks someone and it says &quot;funfight&quot; and when they click that it teleports them and the player to a fun fight area. But I tried to make a command, that when we type ::funfightoff it turns it off, and when we type, ::funfighton, it turns it on.

Here is the command:

[code]    if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;funfightoff&quot;) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 3)) {

		    if(wildyoff == 0) {
		wildyoff = 1; //remember if it is 1 the funfight should be off.
      sendMessage(&quot;funfight is now Disabled&quot;);
		PlayerHandler.messageToAll = playerName+&quot; has Disabled funfight&quot;;
	    }
    }
    if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;funfighton&quot;) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 3)) {

		    if(wildyoff == 1) {
		wildyoff = 0; // 0 means fun fight is on.
      sendMessage(&quot;funfight is now Enabled&quot;);
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = playerName+&quot; has Enabled funfight&quot;;
	    }
    }[/code]

This is what I added for my interface thing:

[code]if(wildyoff == 0) 
{
		outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
		outStream.writeByteC(2);		// command slot
		outStream.writeByteA(0);		// 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context menu
		outStream.writeString(&quot;@gre@Fun Fight&quot;);
		outStream.endFrameVarSize();
}
if(wildyoff == 1)
{
		outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
		outStream.writeByteC(2);		// command slot
		outStream.writeByteA(0);		// 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context menu
		outStream.writeString(&quot;@gre@Fun Fight&quot;);
		outStream.endFrameVarSize();
}[/code]

This is what I added for packet 153:

[code]         case 153: //Fun Fight
if(wildyoff == 0) {
AttackingOn = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();
server.ffHandler.funfight(playerId, AttackingOn);
if(wildyoff == 1) {
sendMessage(&quot;Fun fight has currently been disabled.&quot;);
}
break; 
}[/code]

When I type ::funfightoff, it works but it keeps wanting to trade, also it does not send the message that I want it to send. If I show you this in more detail:

[code]        outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
        outStream.writeByteC(4); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
        outStream.writeByteA(0); // 0 or 1; 0 if command should be placed on top in context menu
        outStream.writeString(&quot;@cya@Trade with&quot;);
        outStream.endFrameVarSize();

if(wildyoff == 0) 
{
		outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
		outStream.writeByteC(2);		// command slot
		outStream.writeByteA(0);		// 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context menu
		outStream.writeString(&quot;@gre@Fun Fight&quot;);
		outStream.endFrameVarSize();
}
if(wildyoff == 1)
{
		outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
		outStream.writeByteC(2);		// command slot
		outStream.writeByteA(0);		// 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context menu
		outStream.writeString(&quot;@gre@Fun Fight&quot;);
		outStream.endFrameVarSize();
}[/code]

I was thinking if I need to add a bracket, because I guess it is going to trade when fun fight if off, because it is open

Thanks
