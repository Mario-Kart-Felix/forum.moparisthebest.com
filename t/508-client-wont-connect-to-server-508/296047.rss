    <title>[508] Client won&#39;t connect to server [508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-client-wont-connect-to-server-508/296047</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m stuck right now and hopefully someone here can help me. I have portforwarded, changed to my IP in the client.java. And I am running the server first. No errors are coming up, and my run window is saying Connection received from: 192.168.1.1. Yet it stalls when I click login and    ends saying Error connecting to server. Yet no errors are coming up. 

Please and thanks,
