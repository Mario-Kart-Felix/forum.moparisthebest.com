    <description>Been meaning to post this for a while. So about half a year ago I came down with flu, not really uncommon. I had the usual symptoms, of course I couldn&#39;t taste my food very well or smell many things.

So the flu went away, but ever since then I haven&#39;t been able to smell stuff as well as I used to, in fact most things smell and taste a lot different to how they used to.

So whats up with that? It&#39;s quite depressing not being able to smell stuff I used to be able to. And a lot of the time I wonder if I myself might smell without me knowing it. 

Anybody know whats up with that?</description>

              <blockquote>Smell and taste disorders are common in the general population, with loss of smell occurring more frequently. Although these disorders can have a substantial impact on quality of life and may represent significant underlying disease, they are often overlooked by the medical community.</blockquote>

              <p>i agree with the fact you have H1N1 mate <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Well these things change naturally as you grow up, you grow out of tastes and so on and grow new ones. But the smells could be due to this or that your nose has started to block it out, if you smell something alot for along time your nose starts to ignore it permanently and not just temporarily, your ears do the same with sound.</p>
