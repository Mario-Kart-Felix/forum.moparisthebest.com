    <title>(Support) Need A Hoster?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/support-need-a-hoster/224654</link>
    <description>Hello, if you are looking for a hoster, you have come to the right place!

Hoster Information:
Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU
T5750 @ 2.00ghz
2.00 GB
Netgear Follower / Already Portfowarded / With no-ip.

How we will do this and my inspiration:

First i will start with my inspiration, Bizerk (T4_) owner of PJA runescape private server inspired me to join the community of runelocus.

and i just got my laptop and i wanna do something with it to know its compatabilities.

it will hold up to 160 players 155 players with lag and once at 160 other connections will be declined.

now to how we will do this, yes i will be charging but i will give you the oppertunity to have the opinion to accept my offer or decline / i will be hosting your server / or website for free for the next week hence it WILL be 24/7 unless update or scan.

my price 3$ a week .
first week is free like i said and you dont have to pay from your own pocket of course you can always accept donations for other players and give it to me.


NOTE * 
for me to host your server, you must already have a community set up a website fourms client and everything and such and gaming ready to begin.

i will not host crappy half ballsacked servers like silabpkz or some crap like that.

Ah yes i forgot to mention that it will also be run with a server restarter created by me.

and bizerk(T4_) if your reading this by any chance i dont know why you closed the server that one all of a sudden but if it was becuase of hosting ill gladly do it for you.</description>
