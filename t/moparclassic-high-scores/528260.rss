    <title>MoparClassic High Scores</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparclassic-high-scores/528260</link>
    <description>How hard would it be to implement a high score viewing interface within the game client? It just struck me as a reasonable approach that wouldn&#39;t necessitate poor man&#39;s log shipping (as discussed in the stickied topic).


The way I see it, the only things a website are typically used for are:

[ol][li]Account creation (which is going to be handled through the client now).[/li]
	[li]Marketplace[/li]
	[li]High score viewing.[/li][/ol]

If we used reddit for the marketplace, and added a high score facility within the client, then there would be no more need for a website in my opinion.

<p>Then it’s just a matter of using LIMITed queries to return a subset of the highscores. The queries would be no different to those used to populate a web page.</p>
<p>Clicking a player’s name from within the current page view would issue the search by player packet.</p>

Do you have an idea already for what it would look like?</p>
<p>Also, that’s a lot more work than just designing a simple site, and I’m not sure people would even care enough about it. I mean, it could be amazing if we pulled it off, but I think there are other things that need to be done first.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>I just realized we could publish the top people for each skill using Google Docs and have it auto update. All we’d have to do is make the document viewable by the public. We could even have a separate spreadsheet with the full highscores, but it might take a bit to load (though I don’t think it’d be too bad).</p>

<p>Like, we could generate all the highscores tables and link them automatically if you don’t have a search function. PasteHTML has an API for automating it, so it would be really easy.</p>
<p>I guess you could have a separate page for searching that just gives people all the data.</p>
