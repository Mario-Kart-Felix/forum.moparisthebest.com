    <title>Changing save preferences?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-save-preferences/128436</link>
    <description>Hey, I am the creator of Avbscape (Awesome server!! ;D) and everything works fine EXCEPT the saving stuff. It doesn&#39;t save enough and it doesn&#39;t save when players log off only every 60 seconds or so. This normally wouldn&#39;t be a problem since I put warnings in the logout tab but some REALLY ANNOYING PEOPLE don&#39;t read shit when they play my server and items are lost when they log off and the server hasn&#39;t saved. Can someone please tell me what I need to change to make it save like every 30 seconds and when people log off?[br][size=1]Posted on: July 29, 2007, 09:11:49 PM[/size][hr]bump</description>
