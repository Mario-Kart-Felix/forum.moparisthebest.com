    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ritzscape-2014-2015-need-team/548724</link>
    <description>Hey guys, im pretty sure this is sorta in the right place :confused: :confused:

First off im new here, No one knows me lol. I only hosted once so I decided why not bring back ritzscape 2014 and see whats that like. Maybe some people would say &quot;Ritzscape sucks&quot;, honestly I know and thats why I want to bring back and see where it went worng.

I played ritzscape, was the first private server i ever played lol.

Ok well, everyone who played ritzscape might have or might not have liked it. I thought about bringing it back now just copying everything but add in my own features for example coloured yell and all that. I am looking for a team and if you want too see what it looks like i&#39;m happy to post pictures of it. Im looking for a team of coders and a few testers who are willing too download hamachi and test the server.

I dont know if this is alowed or not but i am looking for a hoster too. No im not willing to pay for you but all donations will go to you if you wish.

I am looking for:
Client coder
Hoster (Hopefully)

Heres how too apply. 

Age:

Why should you be picked as a *?:

What are you applying for? (Shows me what you want to do around the server, if you help us out)

Do you have hamachi? (Only way i can contact you)

Do you have any experience at all? (I dont care if you worked on major server or minor servers. I want to see if you can help my server)</description>
