    <title>508 Source + Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-source-client/542070</link>
    <description>Alright, so every source and client I have found either the links are broken or there is no cache and I cannot find it anywhere. I was wondering if anyone has a NON PVP/SPAWN server that does not have any customs. Like a blank server but.. not really. I&#39;ve tried downloading a blank but the links were broken and it was 308. I want a 308 loading 508 cache or just a 508/525. I don&#39;t care if its PI/Delta or InsidiaX/etc. I&#39;m taring it down and re-coding just about everything. Thanks.  :)</description>

              <p>My 508 source has cache client etc but is spawn (if you are a decent java coder you can easily change this) theres no customs though, and combat is pretty good. See <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,651329.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> if you’re interested <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> (and download links work too)</p>
