    <description>Well the name could do with work i suppose but thats ok. Well firstly has anyone heard of Kongregate? if not go to their website and see what its about before reading this thread otherwise it will probably be lost on you. I think it would be pretty cool if there was mopar website like kongregate where people post their games with badges and stuff so that its a games website made by the people of MITB for the people of MITB if everyone contributes it would soon fill up with games and people would be able to earn badges like in Kongregate. What do you think?</description>
