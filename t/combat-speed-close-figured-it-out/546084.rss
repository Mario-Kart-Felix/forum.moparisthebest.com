    <description>Hello Rsc lovers. I&#39;m trying to learn the ins and outs of as much as possible with regards to the easyrsc source. 

I have noticed the combat speed is a little fast at the moment. If someone could point me in the direction of where I would need to change this I would be most grateful. 

EasyRsc is the source I am playing around with if this helps?

Thanks in advance.</description>
