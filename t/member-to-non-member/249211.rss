    <description>Ok when you login to my server your auto-member. [code]character-ismember = 1[/code]
It just auto gives you that, could you tell me what I would change for them to be non-member on login? 
As in, tell me what to search for in .client and then what to change? I&#39;m using a deltascape source.
I don&#39;t want to have and change each character manually. 
Sincerely,
