              <p>While jarring make sure you manifest the gui(if your using pi anyways). Its saying it can’t find the class its looking for which means it cannot run it which means your webclient wont work. I used to have this problem too, I’m not sure if its a flaw with the .jar maker cause I kept redoing until it worked doing the exact same thing.</p>
