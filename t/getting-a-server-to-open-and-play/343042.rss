    <title>Getting a server to open and play</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-a-server-to-open-and-play/343042</link>
    <description>I need the following questions answered:

How do I get a client to open the game so I can play it? 
Are there any IP things I need to change in the server source thing? 

If you have any other questions for getting info, just ask me.

EDIT:
Using the source Projectscapev16 if it matters.
Once I find out how to open my server, and play it, I should be able to get coding, because I understand that part :/</description>

Well, check the GUI for the IP it should look something like this: <code>server ip = "THE.IP.HERE"</code><br>

Wheres the GUI? I can’t find it.</p>

<p>ok i don’t think you understand. because there is this thing called “run.bat” only one like it. It “runs” your server… if you can’t figure that out. then you shouldn’t even try coding.

<p>No, I know that when I run the .bat, it puts up my server, but I still can’t figure out how to join it. But is there any way to change the IP and get a client that connects to that specific IP? When I see 127.0.0.1, is that basically the same as localhost? I want it so others can join.</p>
