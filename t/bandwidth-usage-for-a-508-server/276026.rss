    <title>Bandwidth usage for a 508 server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bandwidth-usage-for-a-508-server/276026</link>
    <description>I&#39;m just wondering really, How much on an average(Whatever number of people someone can give me for an estimate)the bandwidth usage for a 508 server is.
Thanks.
And this is the only place I could think to put this as theres no general questions or discussion for servers.
Oh and I did search, and I found one thing on this subject, but I wanted to be sure. Depending on the usage, you guys can see a new server coming :)</description>
