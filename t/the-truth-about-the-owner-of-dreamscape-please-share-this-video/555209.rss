    <title>The truth about the owner of Dreamscape [PLEASE SHARE THIS VIDEO]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-truth-about-the-owner-of-dreamscape-please-share-this-video/555209</link>
    <description>Hello guys,

I know you guys probably don&#39;t care about other server owners and how corrupt they are, but this video really had to be done. I have been hosting custom servers for more than a year now. Started with Icon PS and now am hosting Victorious317. From the day Icon PS has been up, up until now; the owner of Dreamscape has been up my ass with his threats. It&#39;s so childish and I am getting tired of it. I made this video hoping to change something. Hoping for people to know the truth about him. Hoping for him to stop because there is nothing else I can do. No matter what I do; this guy will always be up my ass with his threats. I love hosting servers with customs, and won&#39;t be able to accomplish anything with this guy ruining it for me. It&#39;s just so sad, the fact that a server with 100+ players is scared from a server with just 15 players.. I don&#39;t expect people to watch this entire video, but if you do; please share it to as many people as possible so everyone knows the truth about this fucking cunt.

Thanks for your attention,

<p>The thing is, I really enjoy hosting RSPS’s and threats like this should not happen. What happened to the good old times when you could host a server without any stupid problems like this?</p>

</aside>
<p>you’re not helping anyone’s case (especially your own, as a representative of your server) by publicly sharing this video.</p>
<p>‘good old times’? like when, if ever? when i was the leader of my server i had to put up with shit like this all the time. you’ll have to figure out how to handle stuff like this.<br>

<p>I’m not the only victim. I’m tired of seeing his dominance of money and power ruin <span class="bbcode-b">so many people’s lives. Yes, lives. He has ruined mine and many others.</span> I’m making this video to bring in awareness about how corrupt the owner of Dreamscape is and hopefully his players realize that.[/quote]</p>
<p>How exactly has he ruined your life? I can see maybe he put a damper on your day. But I can’t see how he has ruined your whole life (And many others). I mean if he hacked your bank account and made you and your whole family homeless then I guess I could understand but I think your over exaggerating a tad.</p>

<p>This is not just about me. It’s about a lot of people. He has been threatening a lot of other people. Doxing them. Calling them on their personal numbers. Attacking them. DDoSing them. He won’t stop until you do what he wants which is either affiliate with him or completely give up in whatever thing you are doing.</p>
