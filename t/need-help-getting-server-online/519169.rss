You are on your network already so you are still 127.0.0.1 lol</p>
<p>Anybody outside of your house needs to be on the no-ip<br>

So are you saying if i change the ip in MY client file to 127.0.0.1 and leave the other ones at no-ip THEY would be able to get on??? will that make a differnce in my client?? im not to good at java, but i dont think changing my client file would help them…[/quote]that’s correct. If you are hosting from your computer you stay on localhost and everybody else must connect via that ip</p>
