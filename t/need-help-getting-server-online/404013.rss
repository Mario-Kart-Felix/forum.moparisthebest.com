    <description>hey i have a 317 with graphics looking like 508+ called erasedpkz i got the source and client off rune-server and im having trouble getting it online. i have no-ip setup with a host and i went to the client.java and put my no-ip host name where it says &quot;server =&quot;.
now i got u torrent as an alternative to opening port 43594 and i go to &quot;canyouseeme.org&quot; and it says that it is open , so the ports open. i made sure i right clicked &quot;compile&quot; and the &quot;runs&quot; made sure they were my java type. the server works fine but i want to put it online. i try to put it online and i keep getting &quot;error connecting to server&quot;. i looked on numerous guides and nonseem to troubleshoot or see my error /problem therefore if anyone can explain why this is happening and how to fix? if you want you can pm me to team view or to talk through msn, or you can tell me the details and how to fix here. and yes, i have tried port 5555 and its still the same dilema.</description>
