<p>so claws can only be gained via actual pvm by donors, or they can donate for them then it leaves regular players to have to buy a ridiculous price for them off the donors? No thanks…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No…they are dropped by tormented demons. Players have a perfectly fair chance. Same goes with every other item, everything is game obtainable without donating.<br>
[/quote]I was going by the picture directly. Doesn’t make sense to have a tormented demon teleport for the “donor interface” if everybody has entrance to the demons.</p>
<p>Good luck though, should change the point value:prices for combat related items to be higher. Torva plate is like $40 which is pretty good should make other items similar. As I said in game anything that is combat related(including dragon defender) should be 20$ at the least.</p>
<p>Eco tips:</p>
<p>-swap out shops, I know you hate it, I hate doing it, everybody does. But you have to keep items from being too “common” swap out old items in all shops with newer items. Maybe even after a limited time take out skiller supplies such as tinderboxes etc for a limited time period to require people to work for those items etc.</p>
<p>Point shops, these can be nice but try to steer away from theme unless the items are untradeable. Why? Because people are going to think they can sell for a higher price then they are worth because they cost points instead.</p>
<p>Remember YOU are the controller of the economy. If you see prices going to high. Ask the players why, ask what they believe can be done but remember it is YOUR decision on what to do.</p>
<p>EVERY content piece you create can/and will affect the economy overall so choose content carefully and try to keep prices balanced at a fairly set range.</p>
<p>Personally…I wouldn’t even have a membership shop people should have to gain all items just like everybody. It’s like buying gold, you are putting items into the economy that aren’t really there(aka printing money)[/quote]<br>
It’s pretty common as they’re typically put in a whole separate area from the open tormented demons.  I.E demons that only donators can get to.</p>

so claws can only be gained via actual pvm by donors, or they can donate for them then it leaves regular players to have to buy a ridiculous price for them off the donors? No thanks…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>No…they are dropped by tormented demons. Players have a perfectly fair chance. Same goes with every other item, everything is game obtainable without donating.[/quote]I was going by the picture directly. Doesn’t make sense to have a tormented demon teleport for the “donor interface” if everybody has entrance to the demons.</p>
<p>Good luck though, should change the point value:prices for combat related items to be higher. Torva plate is like $40 which is pretty good should make other items similar. As I said in game anything that is combat related(including dragon defender) should be 20$ at the least.</p>
<p>Eco tips:</p>
<p>-swap out shops, I know you hate it, I hate doing it, everybody does. But you have to keep items from being too “common” swap out old items in all shops with newer items. Maybe even after a limited time take out skiller supplies such as tinderboxes etc for a limited time period to require people to work for those items etc.</p>
<p>Point shops, these can be nice but try to steer away from theme unless the items are untradeable. Why? Because people are going to think they can sell for a higher price then they are worth because they cost points instead.</p>
<p>Remember YOU are the controller of the economy. If you see prices going to high. Ask the players why, ask what they believe can be done but remember it is YOUR decision on what to do.</p>
<p>EVERY content piece you create can/and will affect the economy overall so choose content carefully and try to keep prices balanced at a fairly set range.</p>
<p>Personally…I wouldn’t even have a membership shop people should have to gain all items just like everybody. It’s like buying gold, you are putting items into the economy that aren’t really there(aka printing money)</p>
