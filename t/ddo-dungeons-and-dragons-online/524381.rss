    <title>DDO - Dungeons and Dragons Online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ddo-dungeons-and-dragons-online/524381</link>
    <description>I never was into the classic D&amp;D game, but from what I hear I do believe it was a local/solo/1player game, but this is I suppose a &quot;remake&quot; of the original D&amp;D or it could be the actual original developers reviving the game. Also as made clear by the title, it is now being brought back in online play mode. You can have guilds/partys do quests and so on, so forth. Now even though I do not know much about the actual classic game like I afore mentioned, however, I want to say this: I generally hates games like this, but I am in love.

EDIT: I don&#39;t know how old this game is etc but I do have the occasional crash even though im playing on a decent computer. my friend crashes as well so I know its just me. maybe their in a somewhat beta-stage meh idk.</description>
