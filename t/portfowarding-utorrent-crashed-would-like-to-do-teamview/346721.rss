              <p>It’s pretty simple. I’m sure there is tutorials in the tutorial section on how to do this. You have to register a domain first with no-ip and then just go into your router, and open up.<br>
Edit: I lol’d, you are offering items from your server for someone to help you out. Really?..</p>
