    <title>Giving RSCShadow access to this section</title>

    <description>I was wondering if you guys are fine with him having access to this section. I noticed that codeforfame said that not as many people as he thought would be contributing. RSCShadow is pretty handy with java and he is now interested in helping out because progress is actually being made. He knows a lot of PHP and can help out with the website a lot if needed.</description>
