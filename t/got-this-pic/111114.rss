    <description>hi ppl!

 i was wondering since i couldnt find it on gooooooogle, if anybody had a picture of moparscape 2.1? it bring back such good memories if i saw it again, so if anybody would be so kind as to post that picture.... it would be much abliged. (im talking about the startup screen that has the welcome to moparscape thing on it, not a picture of a server)</description>
