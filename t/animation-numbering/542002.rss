    <title>Animation numbering</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/animation-numbering/542002</link>
    <description>When the client animations xml file references an AnimationDef entry, it appears to already know which sprites to use for each entry instead of explicitly specifying them for each animation sequence. I went through and numbered them with AnimationDef #240 being the wielded RSCA candy cane item, AnimationDef #241 being the strength skill cape wielded item, and #242 being the attack skill cape wielded item. I have 18 sprites numbered 1755-1772 for the candy cane, 18 sprites numbered 1773-1799, and 18 sprites numbered 1809-1826.

My question is: why is each animation spaced 10 numbers apart? What are the empty 10 place holders buffering each animation sequence able to be used for? I have seen some wielded item animation sequences only use 9 sprites.</description>

              <p>My next question is once the animations reach 1999, 2000 is suddenly the sprite used for the UI menu. How do you add animations beyond that without asking to use already used sprites? I understand that the engine blocks animations greater than 255 as it is using the byte type for the connection and you have to use either int or another type that I forget at the moment. One thought is to renumber the interface sprites to higher numbers to free up sprites 2000 - 2005 and point to them in the client, then modify the sprite numbers for all inventory item sprites to greater than 2596. Projectile sprites resume at 3160 through 3166 and sprites 3220 - 3287 seem fixed to the TexturesDef array but beyond that, Items.rscd can be remapped to free up space for more animation, I suppose.</p>
<p>May just have to create enough to find out and deal with it when the problem happens.</p>

Found spot used for separating sprite sequences apart in the mudclient:<br>
</span><code>EntityHandler.getAnimationDef(animationIndex).number = animationNumber;
            animationNumber += 27; //default spacing between sprites (10 seperate, 17 animations per sequence = 27)</code></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Solution for greater than 255 animations:</span><br>
