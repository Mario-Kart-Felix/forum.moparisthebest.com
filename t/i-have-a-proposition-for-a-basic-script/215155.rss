    <title>I have a proposition for a basic script</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-a-proposition-for-a-basic-script/215155</link>
    <description>Basically I have a decent moneymaking method, similar to newts and vials. The seller is 2 clicks away from a bank. It requires membership, and the method will quickly become useless when more people find out about it. It currently makes around 170k per hour.

The script needs to be flawless and undetectable, otherwise I would make it myself. If anybody is interested pm me and I&#39;ll give you the details. Don&#39;t bother unless you&#39;re a good scripter.</description>
