    <description>Hey guys, this is the owner of a fairly new server named Empathy PK.  We are looking for 1 or 2 moderators an admin, a hidden admin, and possibly another coder i feel would be fit for the job.  We have a Delta server but its code is not like all other deltas, its strange.  If you are interested in any of the spots you can download the client and alk to us, or just post on our forums.  Here are some other details.

Dl Client:  http://www.mediafire.com/?48ZBAR8XEX6E06R

Forums:  http://empathypk.webs.com/

Admin Spot:  If you really want this spot I will need to know you very well and have bee talking to you for quite some time to earn it.  You also must be a pretty active player and help other players that need help.  You should not disrespect other players even if they are being ignorant.  If you abuse powers than you will be demoted and bank reset.

Moderator:  To get this spot you basically just need to be active and help players.  It would help greatly if i knew you for a little before i give you it because it would increase the amount of trust i have in you.  You should know basic things that new players want to know like how to make money and where and what types of cool things are on the server.

Coder:  Now this spot will be really hard to get.  As i said up there it is delta based but it is not like all other delta servers.  A lot of the common things you think you would know on a delta server are completely different on this one.  We also already have one coder who is amazing.  I just think it would be nice to have a backup in case he does not know what to do.

Alright Thanks guys, Hope to see or hear from you soon.</description>
