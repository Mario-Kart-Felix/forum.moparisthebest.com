    <title>Someone provide me with a link?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/someone-provide-me-with-a-link/428683</link>
    <description>[b]I posted a Topic a while ago but I haven&#39;t got anywhere...
I am looking for a blank source and client but I want it to have all items on it like Godswords, maybe a few customs incase I add some.
I am new at this so I will be looking at some tutorials. Also, maybe an old game frame? If not, the 508 gameframe but with items on it so I can work from there.
Please provide me with a link, I will be very greatful!
If you do provide me with a link I will give you credit, if you help me out also, I will consider giving you co-owner if that is allowed.
Please provide a link please! :)
Cheers.[/b]  :D

**EDIT**
