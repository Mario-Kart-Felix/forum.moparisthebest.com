    <description>(before i ask my question i want to tell you what it was like, seeing all of this happen and colapse, so you can understand my question)

A long time ago after ghostmouse, after autominer, after various bots and things, the runescape cheeting was minimum and nobody thought it would ever stand back on its feet.

Until Kaitnieks came

he posted he was making a scriptable macroer

some believed him some thought it was a hoax

then autorune came out

everyone was so happy

he became famous for bringing runescape cheeting back

then after awhile

runescape figured out how to stop autorune

and cheating was down to minimum again

then kaitnieks made scar!

finaly everyone was able to auto again!



on the kaitnieks forums

cheating was good

everyone was making just enough with scar to have an unfair advantage over the legit players

thats where i came in

my friend told me about scar

i downloaded it and got into runescape cheating

then awhile after that happend then...

you guessed it...

ARYAN...

aryan was possibly the biggest thing to happen to runescape cheating since the dupeing happend

you could auto 24/7 without it messing up

you could use as many accounts as your computer could handle

and the best part is

if runescape banned your accounts

you could just have aryan take abunch of new accounts through tut island!

then get back to cheeting until they banned your level 3&#39;s and you make new level 3&#39;s

so many noobs came to download aryan

it messed up the runescape economy alot

ess was cheep

iron/coal was cheep

autoers had so much surplus materials they could lower their prices to sell fast and it wouldent matter to them cause they would make sooo much money nomatter how much they sold it for

all the autoers were getting rich

then roumors of a &quot;mass ban&quot; were coming up

noone believed it

until that day...

the day that felt to most autoers like if their best friend just died

i was about to go on runeacape happy with my 15 mill full guthan full dharoks a whip and 2 members autoers with 10k flax each that i autoed the night before

i typed runescape.com

i saw the news on runescape on the front page

&#39;mass ban of autoers&#39;

my heart sank to the floor

i read it and every word i read was like a sharp dagger in the cheast

it said not only were they banning the level 3 autoers THEY BANNED THE MAIN ACCOUNTS!

i played runescape alot

me and all of my friends at school played runescape

i played for years legit on my main account

i had never autoed on my main account NEVER

i was almost level 90

in fact my main was in my training spot

when i heard the news runescape did a mass ban

i tried to tell myselfi wasent one of the ones banned

so i went to world 2

tried logging on my first flax autoer

banned

tried my second flax autoer

banned

i was so scared my heart was beating so fast

when i was typing in my mains username and pass it felt like slow motion

keystroke after keystroke

then i moved the mouse over enter

clicked the mouse

i would have sworn that when i saw what i saw, my heart completly stopped

and what i saw was

&#39;your account is banned&#39;

my main account

my prized posesion

gone

completly and totaly gone

my main was dead

and then i found out

the reason it happend

WAS BECAUSE THE ARYAN TEAM MADE ARYAN HAVE NEGATIVE UID&#39;s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i hated everyone and quit runescape and quit the runescape cheating community




when i left i didnt think i would be coming back

now i got over what happend

and i missed everyone

so now i am back

aryan is dead

sbot is dead

the only reason scar isnt dead is because SRL




so now i ask you

what has happend?

where is the cheating we used to have

where is the revolution we were creating?


cheating is down just like a long time ago

kaitnieks made autorune and kaitnieks made scar when everyone thought cheating would never come back

kaitnieks was a good leader and never let us down

then regex came with aryan and messed everything up

he made the best bot ever and backstabbed us all by getting most of us banned

some got lucky and didnt get banned from aryan

but most got banned from aryan

as a result of regex&#39;s little joke to get us all banned

jagex attacked and put too much of a hassel on kaitnieks to keep the forums up

kaitnieks had a baby on the way and didnt need to be worrying about all this law stuf



we need a new program

we need somthing that jagex cant fight back

we need somthing flawless

we need somthing that will make us all rich and wont have us get stabbed in the back

cheating is down

we need someone like kaitnieks to turn that all around

we need someone to make a revolutionary program and lead us to victory of overthrowing jagex ltd



who will be our new kaitnieks?

who will bring runescape cheating back?

who?</description>

<p>All I can say, is if Tiaos gives ARGA out for free, you guys better suck it up, shut up, and not bitch. She is about the only hope I see of the public getting a java bot.
