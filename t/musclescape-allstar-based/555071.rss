    <description>This is a brand new server, based off of allstar source. I do not yet have a client specifically for this server so I recommend using Galkon&#39;s client which can be downloaded here http://www.mediafire.com/download/eisygyml2js/Galkons+Client.rar

What I have to offer

Working skills
Custom items
Strength and mage/range guild
Shops(Working but under construction)
Working barrows (Also under construction)
Pkbox
Team Pking
Training Area(Also under construction)
Mini Game to get a godsword, this will be replaced with Godwars in the future

What I need

I need a coder and staff members
Forums with working vote system
Working donation system to keep the server live
Donation symbol
Pvp Armors (Vesta, Stat, Morrigans, Zuriels)

Hope to see new players in game soon! Have fun. The server ip is musclescape.no-ip.biz</description>

<p>I agree with Wimstr but your server is pretty much blank. You have got features that pretty much don’t work and your combat is very weak. Nothing works here but I am willing to help you if you want but you should work on the server before advertising. It’s like me posting a server with nothing in it just the simple stuff.</p>
