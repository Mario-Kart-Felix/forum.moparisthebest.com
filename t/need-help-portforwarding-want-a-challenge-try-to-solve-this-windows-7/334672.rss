    <title>NEED HELP PORTFORWARDING - Want a challenge? Try to solve this... (WINDOWS 7)</title>

    <description>Hi it&#39;s me again.

I need help on the hardest part.  Port forwarding.  Dun dun dun....

Mkay uTorrent sometimes works sometimes doesn&#39;t but I never got it to work on 43594
[u][b]
EDIT: THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING ALL PORTS APPEAR OPEN EXCEPT 43594

ALSO PLEASE NOTE I&#39;M USING WINDOWS 7 HOME PREMIEM x64 bit[/b][/u]

portforward.com i have tried and none of the below guides/configs work.

[img]http://i272.photobucket.com/albums/jj168/Roboticopperatingbuddy/op1.png[/img]

On the runescape private server guide says to forward my port to 43594 I have to make it look like what it looks like on their page then add my private IP and click apply when I&#39;ve done so it says settings saved but nothing happens...

[img]http://i272.photobucket.com/albums/jj168/Roboticopperatingbuddy/varbs.png[/img]

I Use D-Link 624 router.

Their port checker software says the port isn&#39;t open.  And I try to login anyway but no luck.  I can play privately with IP 127.0.0.1 but when I use my IP lonescape.servegame.com it sometimes says no response from server or Error connecting to server.

Please help me I have been putting as much effort into this as I can and I can&#39;t get this step right.   :(</description>

              <p>Hi it’s me again.</p>
<p>I need help on the hardest part.  Port forwarding.  Dun dun dun…</p>
<p>Mkay uTorrent sometimes works sometimes doesn’t but I never got it to work on 43594<br>
[u][b]<br>
EDIT: THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING ALL PORTS APPEAR OPEN EXCEPT 43594</p>
<p>ALSO PLEASE NOTE I’M USING WINDOWS 7 HOME PREMIEM x64 bit[/b][/u]</p>
<p><a href="http://portforward.com" rel="nofollow noopener">portforward.com</a> i have tried and none of the below guides/configs work.</p>
<p><img src="http://i272.photobucket.com/albums/jj168/Roboticopperatingbuddy/op2.png" alt width="220" height="17"><br>
<img src="http://i272.photobucket.com/albums/jj168/Roboticopperatingbuddy/op1.png" alt width="231" height="94"></p>
<p>On the runescape private server guide says to forward my port to 43594 I have to make it look like what it looks like on their page then add my private IP and click apply when I’ve done so it says settings saved but nothing happens…</p>
<p><img src="http://i272.photobucket.com/albums/jj168/Roboticopperatingbuddy/varbs.png" alt width="464" height="194"></p>
<p>I Use D-Link 624 router.</p>
<p>Their port checker software says the port isn’t open.  And I try to login anyway but no luck.  I can play privately with IP 127.0.0.1 but when I use my IP <a href="http://lonescape.servegame.com" rel="nofollow noopener">lonescape.servegame.com</a> it sometimes says no response from server or Error connecting to server.</p>
<p>Please help me I have been putting as much effort into this as I can and I can’t get this step right.   <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
