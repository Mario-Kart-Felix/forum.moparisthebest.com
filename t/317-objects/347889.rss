    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-objects/347889</link>
    <description>This has 2 questions in it.

#1 There are objects already set that I want to remove how would I do that? (Meaning they&#39;re not a makeGlobalObject) 

#2 I&#39;m making Theiveing and I need to make stalls work, as in take a stall that doesn&#39;t work and make it work. How would I do this?</description>

              <p>Yeah I know the rest about addSkillXP(xp,id) but where would I start the command exactly so it doesn’t cross another code? And could you please help me with the code because I’m not too good with that kind of coding yet. I’m more on the type of just editing codes more than making my own</p>

<p>i gave you pretty much everything, for number one i gave you the void. learn how to use it, its very easy.<br>
for number 2, i started it for you, you have to do the rest like addSkillXP(xp amount, skill id); and stuff.</p>
