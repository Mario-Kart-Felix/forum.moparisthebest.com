    <description>So here is the code:

[code]
         Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);
         System.out.println(&quot;How much will John be spending?&quot;);
         double amount = console.nextDouble();
         System.out.println();
         int numBills1 = (int) (amount/20.0);
         if (numBills1 * 20.0 &lt; amount) {
            numBills1++;
        }
        System.out.println(&quot;How much will Jane be spending?&quot;);
        amount = console.nextDouble();
        System.out.println();
        int numBills2 = (int) (amount / 20.0);
        if (numBills2 * 20.0 &lt; amount) {
            numBills2++;
        }
        System.out.println(&quot;John needs &quot; + numBills1 + &quot; bills&quot;);
        System.out.println(&quot;Jane needs &quot; + numBills2 + &quot; bills&quot;);
[/code]

Can someone help me restructure this so it isn&#39;t redundant? I believe I need to add a method requiring at least one or more parameters. Any help is appreciated.</description>

Write a piece of code that reads a shorthand text description of a color and prints the longer equivalent. Acceptable color names are B for Blue, G for Green, and R for Red. If the user types something other than B,G, OR R, the program should print an error message. Make your program case-insensitive so that the user can type an uppercase or lowercase letter. Here are some example executions:</p>
<p>What color do you want? B<br>
You have chosen Blue.</p>
<p>What color do you want? R<br>

Write a piece of code that reads a shorthand text description of a playing card and prints the longhand equivalent. The shorthand description is the card’s rank (2 through 10, J, Q, K, or A) followed by its suit (C, D, H, or S). You should expand the shorthand into the form " of ". You may assume that the user types valid input. Here are two sample executions:</p>
<p>Enter a card: 9 S<br>
Nine of Spades</p>
<p>Enter a card: K C<br>
King of Clubs[/quote]<br>
I won’t do this one for you, but I suggest having a Card class with a Rank and Suit enum. You can override the toString() method in the Rank and Suit enums to produce the full name (ex: “Nine” for Rank and “Spades” for Suit). In both enums you can have a method called fromString which takes a String, which is supposed to be a single character (ex: “9” for Rank and “S” for spades) and take the first character in the String and switch on its value returning the correct enum type. If you need help with enums, check out <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html%5B/quote%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html[/quote]</a><br>
Wow that looks a lot simpler than the way I did it but we haven’t gone that far in the class and my professor is expecting us to handle it using arrays. This is how I did it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);
		Task3(console);
	}

	public static void Task3(Scanner console) {
		String[] suits = {"Spades", "Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs"};
		String[] ranks = {"A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K"};
		String[] cardName = {"S", "H", "D", "C"};
		String[] cardNums = {"Ace", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Jack", "Queen", "King"};
		String cardRankVar = " ";
		String cardSuitVar = " ";
		
		System.out.println("Select a card: ");
		String cardRank = console.next();
		String cardSuit = console.next();
		
		for(int i = 0; i &lt; ranks.length; i++) 
		{
			if(cardRank.equals(ranks[i])) 
			{
				cardRankVar = cardNums[i];
			}
		}
		for(int j = 0; j &lt; cardName.length; j++)
		{
			if(cardSuit.equals(cardName[j])) 
			{
				cardSuitVar = suits[j];
			}	
		}
		
		System.out.print(cardRankVar + " of " + cardSuitVar);
	}
}</code></pre>
