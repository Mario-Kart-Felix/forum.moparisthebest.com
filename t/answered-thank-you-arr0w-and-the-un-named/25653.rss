    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/answered-thank-you-arr0w-and-the-un-named/25653</link>
    <description>Ok, can someone tell me about includes

1) How do they work, I know how to install, and things, but i&#39;m interested to making my own :rolleyes:


2) How does the script &quot;call&quot; things from include, like

[scar]
program bla;

{.include example.scar}

procedure something;

Do_Something_What_Is_In_Include

[/scar]
So, I mean, i have not told the script, what &quot;Do_something...&quot; is, example

(NO)
[scar]
var
do_something_what_is_in_include:boolean;
[/scar]


If, i haven&#39;t done that, to script, it says; &quot;unknown &quot;something&quot; in script (line:something)blahblahblah.&quot;


But, If I put an include, what has that, does the script know that that is boolean?
I know, i did not make any sense, but if you managed to read into here, and you don&#39;t know what i mean,

[size=50pt]HOW DOES INCLUDES WORK?[/size]


Thank you.</description>
