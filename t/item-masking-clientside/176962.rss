    <title>Item Masking **Clientside**</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/item-masking-clientside/176962</link>
    <description>Hey,  If anyone would like to be helpful and explain to me how to item-mask or add new items (Runescape items) then it would be much appreciated.  Remember, this is CLIENTSIDE. Not Serverside.

Note:edit: If you even know what folder the items are in, that would be great to.</description>
