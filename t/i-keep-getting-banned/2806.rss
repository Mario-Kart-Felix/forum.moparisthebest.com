              <p>Somebody said something about ip sweaping.<br>
I think they check ip that was autoed on every now and then and see if there any accounts active.</p>
<p>Ive recently made a clean noob on a fresh proxy, only for item stashing. Played with it on legit client, bought new picks etc (haven’t macroed or traded yet). After a couple of days i log in with it and see that he is banned. So i went to check what crap ban reason fagsex came up with. And yes ive been banned for macroing, and due to my “previous record” its permanent ban.<br>
So that proxy i was using was already autoed on and therefor ip ban.</p>
<p>Maybe its a good idea to scan ur own socks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> and not grab from sites</p>

              <p>You can’t find the “marks.”  You’ll have no idea until they ban you.  And this I can confirm because when I was writing SCAR scripts, I got an account banned.  I appealed, won the appeal, and the response I got back said they’ll temp ban for 3 days and reduce my “black marks” to 3.  Whether this means I had 4 on the account or not, I have no idea.  BUT when you use Aryan, the accounts used WILL be banned.  This cannot be stressed enough.  It’s been said since the beginning.  And trading with your “main” can very likely get it banned as well.  That is just how it is.  You have to be careful with what you do.  I have nearly 200 Mil collected across a few accounts and they’ve all been safe, but since I don’t play the game, autoing pretty much makes NO sense at all to me.  I just have all of this GP on throw away accounts for no reason.  Simply because i enjoy doing it when I have time.  Some people seem to have all kinds of problems with getting their “mains” banned, but I don’t use a proxy at all and none of my storage accounts have been banned with my autoers.  You just have to be careful.</p>

              <p>its not the same as using the ip</p>
<p>the whole point of the proxy is to keep your main account using your ip while the bots use the proxies (that way they ban the proxy)<br>
you can use all 5 bots on one proxy but itd be better for your bots if you kept one for each</p>
