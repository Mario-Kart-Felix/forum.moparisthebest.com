Hello Everyone,

** client **


My name is Dwayn, Maybe you know me as &quot;Joon123&quot; and I&#39;ve decided to create a server.
But, In this server I&#39;ve been made soo much progress, So I decided to make it online, So other players could play on it.
WHY ALSTAR?
I&#39;ve been coding allstars for the past 2-3 years now and I still like them.
I&#39;m looking forward to play with players who has the same feeling with this kind of servers.

What have I done so far?

[ FEATURES ]

* ALL skills(except slayer - 60%) are 100% recoded and reworked the best I&#39;ve could done. (see pictures below).
* ANTI - SYI 100%
* ANTI - HEIGHTLEVEL 
* ANTI - TRADEBUG
* SKILL LOCATION REWORKED
* SHOPS AND PRICES REWORKED
* SLAYER MONSTER &amp; BOSSES ARE ADDED( XP rates need to need to be added).

&amp;&amp; theres lots which you can view below



AGILITY:

How to train AGILITY?
First go to skills, ::skill command.

In the north-east corner, there is hanging a rope, just click on it and it will teleport you to AGILITY.

NOW what you all have to do is run the course, SEE THE PICTURES!!!

That is agility.

I HOPE ENJOY IT

Farming:
There are now 7 diffrent paths.

Level 1 Bush - Example: Jangerberries, Dwellberries, Red Berries, White Berries, Poison Ivy &amp; more
Level 25 - Calquat Tree
Level 45 - Cactus
Level 53 - Herb Patch
Level 66 - Allotment - Example: Onion, Sweetcorn, Strewberry &amp; more! 
level 76 - Hops - Example : Hammerstone, Asgarnian, wildblood &amp; more!
level 91 - Bittercap mushroom

!! FARMING IS AUTO, NOT A CLICK SKILL LIKE IT WAS !!

All of them need 8 minutes to grow, But all of them have diffrent start timers.
Like: Bush starts at 7min, Calguat at 6:45min, Cactus at 5min. (--&gt; for example).
Each patch the XP will increase alot since I think farming is abit of a pointless skill.
If you are interested, try it yourself !

Pictures farming:

Mining:
Mining was like one purple rock, well I&#39;ve made it diffrent!

Copper ore - Level 1.
Iron ore - level 15.
Coal ore - level 30.
Gold ore - level 40.
Mithril ore - level 55.
Adamantite ore - level 70.
Runite ore - level 85.

Like farming, Mining is the same.
Mining is also an auto skill, But there one diffrent.
The &#39;resource&#39; can be depleted by an amount of time (10 seconds - 1minute).
If it&#39;s depleted NONE can mine from the ore.

Mining Place Picture:

Woodcutting &amp; Fletching &amp; Firemaking:

Woodcutting is an easy skill, You just go to a tree and click on the tree, You&#39;ll AUTO chop off some wood from the tree.
One diffrent is there, the tree will regrow with a random timer from 5 seconds up to 55 seconds and the timer is for all the trees the same.
You DONT NEED AN AXE!!!

Level 1: normal tree
Level 30: willow tree
Level 45: Maple tree
Level 75: Yew tree
Level 91: Magic tree

If you go to another tree, You&#39;ll also receive more XP, But each tree has an other regrow timer, like I said before!

Fletching:
You Need a knife for this skill.
You just click: Knife(log) + log(Knife) = Shortbow or Longbow

GUIDE:

Theiving used to be the &#39;money making&#39;  in the server.
I&#39;ve changed this into abit more usefull skill.

HOW?
There are two stalls you can use for training other skills (GEM STALL: uncut gems(crafting) and (FISH STALL: raw fish).
Also thieving will give you FASTER raw fish and uncut gems(which is usefull for faster training).

~!! BUTTT !!~
There is a chance that the stall is &#39;empty&#39;. in the mean time cannot take any supplies from the stalls!
SEE PICTURE:

35 -- fur stall
65 -- silk stall

That’s because the NPC’s aren’t aggressive… it doesn’t have anything to do with the server’s combat.<br>
For a second I thought you were talking about the Delta combat bug where if you were previously in combat and attack an NPC you would hit once and then stop attacking while still be attacked by the NPC.</p>

<p>My name is Dwayn, Maybe you know me as “Joon123” and I’ve decided to create a server.<br>
But, In this server I’ve been made soo much progress, So I decided to make it online, So other players could play on it.<br>
WHY ALSTAR?<br>
I’ve been coding allstars for the past 2-3 years now and I still like them.<br>
I’m looking forward to play with players who has the same feeling with this kind of servers.</p>
<p>What have I done so far?</p>
<p>[ FEATURES ]</p>
<ul>
<li>ALL skills(except slayer - 60%) are 100% recoded and reworked the best I’ve could done. (see pictures below).</li>
<li>ANTI - SYI 100%</li>
<li>ANTI - HEIGHTLEVEL</li>
<li>ANTI - TRADEBUG</li>
<li>SKILL LOCATION REWORKED</li>
<li>SHOPS AND PRICES REWORKED</li>
<li>SLAYER MONSTER &amp; BOSSES ARE ADDED( XP rates need to need to be added).</li>
</ul>
<p>&amp;&amp; theres lots which you can view below</p>
<p>AGILITY:</p>
<p>How to train AGILITY?<br>
First go to skills, ::skill command.</p>
<p>In the north-east corner, there is hanging a rope, just click on it and it will teleport you to AGILITY.</p>
<p><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/rw6wi1.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>NOW what you all have to do is run the course, SEE THE PICTURES!!!</p>

<p>That is agility.</p>
<p>I HOPE ENJOY IT</p>
<p>Farming:<br>
There are now 7 diffrent paths.</p>
<p>Level 1 Bush - Example: Jangerberries, Dwellberries, Red Berries, White Berries, Poison Ivy &amp; more<br>
Level 25 - Calquat Tree<br>
Level 45 - Cactus<br>
Level 53 - Herb Patch<br>
Level 66 - Allotment - Example: Onion, Sweetcorn, Strewberry &amp; more!<br>
level 76 - Hops - Example : Hammerstone, Asgarnian, wildblood &amp; more!<br>
level 91 - Bittercap mushroom</p>
<p>!! FARMING IS AUTO, NOT A CLICK SKILL LIKE IT WAS !!</p>
<p>All of them need 8 minutes to grow, But all of them have diffrent start timers.<br>
Like: Bush starts at 7min, Calguat at 6:45min, Cactus at 5min. (–&gt; for example).<br>
Each patch the XP will increase alot since I think farming is abit of a pointless skill.<br>
If you are interested, try it yourself !</p>
<p>Pictures farming:<br>

<p>Mining:<br>
Mining was like one purple rock, well I’ve made it diffrent!</p>
<p>Copper ore - Level 1.<br>
Iron ore - level 15.<br>
Coal ore - level 30.<br>
Gold ore - level 40.<br>
Mithril ore - level 55.<br>
Adamantite ore - level 70.<br>
Runite ore - level 85.</p>
<p>Like farming, Mining is the same.<br>
Mining is also an auto skill, But there one diffrent.<br>
The ‘resource’ can be depleted by an amount of time (10 seconds - 1minute).<br>
If it’s depleted NONE can mine from the ore.</p>
<p>Mining Place Picture:<br>

<p>Woodcutting &amp; Fletching &amp; Firemaking:</p>
<p>Woodcutting is an easy skill, You just go to a tree and click on the tree, You’ll AUTO chop off some wood from the tree.<br>
One diffrent is there, the tree will regrow with a random timer from 5 seconds up to 55 seconds and the timer is for all the trees the same.<br>
You DONT NEED AN AXE!!!</p>
<p>Level 1: normal tree<br>
Level 30: willow tree<br>
Level 45: Maple tree<br>
Level 75: Yew tree<br>
Level 91: Magic tree</p>
<p>If you go to another tree, You’ll also receive more XP, But each tree has an other regrow timer, like I said before!</p>
<p>Fletching:<br>
You Need a knife for this skill.<br>
You just click: Knife(log) + log(Knife) = Shortbow or Longbow</p>

<p>Theiving:</p>
<p>How to get there?<br>
Got to ::skill or use the EMOTE TAB and click on skills.<br>
second go to the portal(not the skills shop) and click on it and than this option will appear and choose for loc 3.<br>

<p>Now you’ll appear at this location:<br>
<img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/mmq6nt.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Theiving used to be the ‘money making’  in the server.<br>
I’ve changed this into abit more usefull skill.</p>
<p>HOW?<br>
There are two stalls you can use for training other skills (GEM STALL: uncut gems(crafting) and (FISH STALL: raw fish).<br>
Also thieving will give you FASTER raw fish and uncut gems(which is usefull for faster training).</p>
<p>~!! BUTTT !!~<br>
There is a chance that the stall is ‘empty’. in the mean time cannot take any supplies from the stalls!<br>
SEE PICTURE:<br>
<img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/a5hoig.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>THIEVING LEVEL – STALL<br>
1 – Bakery stall<br>
35 – fur stall<br>
65 – silk stall<br>
80 – gem stall<br>
87 – fish stall<br>

<p>CRAFTING:</p>
<p>First of all, HOW CAN YOU GET THE GEMSS???</p>
<p>You can get them from the GEM rock (skills location 1)<br>
This require: level 1 mining.<br>
or you can get them by thieving, the gem stall.<br>
This require: level 80 thieving.</p>
<p>One note: You’ll receive more gems and faster gems from the gem stall than from the gem rock, aswell the gem rock will deplete aswell faster.</p>

<p>How do you start??<br>
First off all you need to buy a CHISEL from the skills shop, The skills shop is at any skill location (1, 2 or 3).<br>
It will only cost: 1gp.<br>
<img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/24b8181.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Than you only have to go to the gem rock(loc 1) or go to the gem stall(loc3, req: 80 thieving)<br>
Use the CHISEL on the uncut GEM and it will AUTO UNCUT them all!</p>
