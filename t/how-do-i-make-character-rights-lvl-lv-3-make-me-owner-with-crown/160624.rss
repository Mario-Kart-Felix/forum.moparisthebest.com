              <p>when you’re 3 others can see the crown but you can’t.<br>
But this will help:</p>
<p>All it is to add a bugfix:</p>
<p>open client.java, search for</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">out.write(playerRights);</code></pre>
<p>then REPLACE that line with</p>
<p><code>
			if (playerRights == 3) {
			out.write(2);      //Crown fixup
			} else {
			out.write(playerRights);		// mod level
			}</code></p>
<p>that’ll let owners see their own crown (which is the only playerRights group that can’t otherwise)</p>
