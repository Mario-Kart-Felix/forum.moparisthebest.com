    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-a-few-commands-on-delta-source/255814</link>
    <description>Hey guys, this is the first time i&#39;m trying to code a delta source, basically alot is the same but im having trouble getting some of the following delta commands:

::givemod
::giveadmin

<p>Your two codes seem to be for Project Czar. R34P4G3PK, you can use that as a base for your command, but I don’t think it will work perfectly, since DeltaScape uses different coding conventions.</p>
