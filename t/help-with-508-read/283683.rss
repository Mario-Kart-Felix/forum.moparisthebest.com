    <description>Hi guys. 

When I do an object code, For example, I made it so when you click on a ladder, you get teled to a certain place.

I put a code in so when you click on the stairs in the lumbridge castle, you get teled to the second level of the castle, but When I click on the stairs, it does a tele GFX + Animation, as aposed to just taking me to the 2nd level without doing the GFX + Animation.

Can someone tell me how to make it so when I click on the stairs, it doesn&#39;t do the tele Anim, it just takes me to the 2nd floor automatically, skipping the tele anim.</description>
