    <description>I want to know how to place an npc for my server I will add a pic (from another thread) My server is not Hippescape my servers name is Mupescape v1 and I want wise old man old man on my server to say &quot;Welcome to Mupescape v1!!&quot; (without quotes even though most of you people already know that)
I want it to start off around my training spot which is xcoord: 3191 ycoord: 3431 (facing south) on one side and xcoord:3199 ycoord:3431 (facing south) on the other. I want both of them to stay still without movement. I will appreciate some help from you people and even though probably most of you people don&#39;t even know what I am talking about...

This is from my previous thread then someone told me 
&quot;To place an npc follow below:
-Go to autospawn.cfg after you have got the ID number for the npc you want
-You will see the coords copied and pasted 3 times. 
-It will say the npc ID and change that after you copied and pasted another npc.
-Find the case where the npc talk in npchandler.java and changewhat it says
(add the ID above)
A bit obvious. And most people probs knows what ur talking about. You already
posted half of what you wanted with the choords in the speech above? So I dont know
why you posted that.&quot;

what do I do with &quot;Height--RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2-WalkType-Descrption&quot;???If any of you people respond thanks for help  :)</description>
