    <title>COD5 and COD4 &gt; Any Other Xbox Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cod5-and-cod4-any-other-xbox-game/290399</link>
    <description>You guys have got to admit, Call of Duty is actually a pretty damn good game. I&#39;m going to get really sensitive, but if you actually understand how hard it is to create a game, you&#39;d think this game is good. The gameplay on both is amazing, but I think the guns on COD4 are better, especially the snipers. On COD5, the maps are a bit larger, and there is plenty of space to move around in. The graphics are pretty much the same, I do not want to get into graphics. 

If you want to know which game is better, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare has been rated higher than Call of Duty: World At War. The Nazi Zombies on Call of Duty: World at War gets rid of the fact that it&#39;s a World War II game, and to be honest, World War II is used a lot in the game industry, so thumbs up to Nazi Zombies. Nazi Zombies is fun and entertaining, there&#39;s always action, but Call of Duty 4 is still kind of better (It&#39;s rated like .3 higher or something...). 

Anyway, post here why or why not you like either games pl0x.</description>

<p>Nah, unlock the first stairs then unlock the help room, with 4 people it’s easy to hold off, the advantages of this are: windows always locked, access to the box, and you can take shifts with the stairs.</p>

<p>Democrats are Union people, and they are OBAMA. OBAMA is a DEMOCRAT, and he is MUSLIM, and I don’t really think Bush did anything to ruin the US(if he did, then I don’t care). The only bad Republican was Richard Nixon, but the other ones were best :. I guess that’s because my whole family is based on Republicans and not faggot Democrats.

<p>Treyarch is actually a great company, remember COD3? It was made by Treyarch. Do you understand how hard it is to make a game…? Nope. I like COD4 better, I just played it again after renting it at Blockbuster, then played it on Xbox Live. Amazing.</p>

I got to 22 by myself, so stop acting like a dick. I can help if I want to…</p>
<p>Do not open the Help door. Open up the stairs at round 4, then go down the other stairs on round 6/7. Stay in the Help room.</p>
<p>The Help room is best for 2-4 people, there are x4 the zombies with 4 players, x2 the zombies with 2 players (obviously). Nazi Zombies must be your flaw lol, I get to high waves on every game (on CoD5).</p>
