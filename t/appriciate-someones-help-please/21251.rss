    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/appriciate-someones-help-please/21251</link>
    <description>ok well when i first started playing moparscape i&#39;d open it and it would only open the black box. A few months later(a week ago or so) i try opening it and it opens but only hybridscape will work but then i finally got servers to start working. Every once in a while i&#39;d get frustrated because a server would work for a while, like 4 hours total and then i&#39;d have to shut down the computer for it to work again or several times. And then one time i shut it down and turn it back on it won&#39;t work and i keep shutting it down and that and it just won&#39;t work and even today it still won&#39;t.
Just a little bit ago like today i tryed hybridscape just to spawn items and stuff so that does not work. I try logging in and i spawn something and it has a connection lost and loggs me out, i try logging in again I&#39;m already logged in or error of that sort.

I downloaded Moparscape 3.1

1 other thing, I&#39;m not the smart when it comes to....practicly anything on the computer so try not to use such big words please

THANK YOU FOR READING</description>
