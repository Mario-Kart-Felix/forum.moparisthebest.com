    <title>Port forward via xfinity gateway router</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forward-via-xfinity-gateway-router/455639</link>
    <description>I have the both tcp and udp on 43594 added into the port forwarding and port tiriggering on the cp; I then turn on no-ip , start up server. and it wont connect, i have port forwarded before but it was via vps which i vps is already port forwarded you  just need to unblock the ports you need. this is on windows xp; my vps was windows 2003, i had to disable a lot of services until it finally connected. 

so, what am i missing here for the windows xp computer?</description>
