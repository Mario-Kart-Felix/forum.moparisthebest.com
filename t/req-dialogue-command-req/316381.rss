    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-dialogue-command-req/316381</link>
    <description>ok now i want someone if they can to make a dialogue command to use on a player like you would say ::say (playername) (message) and it forces them to say it like on ipanal with the forced gfx where is makes them do one of the gfx just with talking

Here is an example of the command coding

[code]else if(command.startsWith(&quot;demote&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Patar&quot;)) {
String name = command.substring(7);
try {
int p = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(name);
client c = (client) server.playerHandler.players[p];
c.playerRights = 0;
c.savemoreinfo();
c.savechar();
c.disconnected = true;
sendMessage(name+&quot; is no longer a member of staff&quot;);
} catch(Exception e) {
sendMessage(name+&quot; either isn&#39;t online or doesn&#39;t exist&quot;);
}
}[/code]</description>
