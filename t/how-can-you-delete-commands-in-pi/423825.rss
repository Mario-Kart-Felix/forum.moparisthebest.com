    <title>How can you delete commands in Pi</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-can-you-delete-commands-in-pi/423825</link>
    <description>Hello, I am a new coder, first time actually. I downloaded a PI source and wished to get rid of the commands. I went to commands.java deleted them all, saved and compiled. Yet when I logged in in game, all the commands worked. I am using Hybridpvp v3. Any help is appreciated, thanks.</description>

              <p>Well, I know HBPVP is Pi, but I cannot add or take out. Even after I edit the source and compile. Do I also have to do something to the client side? If so what? I mean I made it do you have to type ::max instead of ::master just to see is it worked, it was a one word edit but even that did not compile and work. How ever I can change character files and things but I cannot add objects, or commands. This is what I need help with. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Well if you find hybrid hard, you’re not really going to find an easier one, maybe delta. Try using a blank PI base and learn from that. Even though HBPVP is based from PI.</p>

              <p>Yeah, tried what it said above, but sadly it does not work. Maybe it is to hard to start out with hybridpvp v3 as a base to learn on. If anyone knows of a good server to start coding on, please let me know. Also what should I learn to start out coding, well to get a better understanding of it so I don’t have to leech.</p>

              <p>Sorry i did not see that you did use commands.java<br>
But you should still follow this guide, as it should help. (remember your imports and statements may not look like mine)</p>
<p>Okay so you are going to not use notepad to edit your files because it can mess them up very bad if you dont know what your doing. I recommend since your a new coder, To get Eclipse. It’s the easiest java coding software to use if your new. It will also help you correct errors too. Also, your commands that are to be used in game, to delete them, You want to go in to commands.java, not just commands.text. The difference is commands.text logs the commands everyone uses so you can view that to ethier catch staff abuse or w\e. On the other hand commands.java or other words, commands.class. Is used to create commands for players, and staff, (donators also). So your going to want to get eclipse, open commands.java(not .class) and do not delete everything because you will get errors, a pro coder will just do this, at the very first command, you will see something like this<br>
if (playerCommand.startsWith(“report”) &amp;&amp; playerCommand.length() &gt; 7) { (example)</p>
<p>In front of the if statment you will put this /*, which voids out anything until you scroll down and put this <em>/.<br>
Make sure you put that /</em> before the if statment, of your very first command in the command.java, and then scroll all the way down until you see the last command, and right after the last command you will see this,<br>
if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(“master”)) {<br>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 22; i++) {<br>
c.playerLevel[i] = 99;<br>
c.playerXP[i] = c.getPA().getXPForLevel(100);<br>
c.getPA().refreshSkill(i);	<br>
}<br>
c.getPA().requestUpdates();<br>
}</p>
<pre><code>}
^ you will see that bracket,  and just do this like so }*/
</code></pre>
<p>then all your commands will be voided, however, you will need to compile, if you wish to make all new commands, then just delete all the if statments, but do not delete these staments and imports. Or you will have no clue how to make a new commands.java file. Hope this helps! =]</p>

<p>Because im assuming he deleted the <code>public void playerCommands(Client c, String playerCommand)</code></p>
<p>And he won’t know how to put it back in since he stated he was a new coder. Without any writing in the commands.java (if the notepad is still there) it will still have the commands that were there before. You have to delete the notepad <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ( ithink, i’ve never deleted all my commands lmfao)</p>
