    <title>What exactly is minimum damage?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-exactly-is-minimum-damage/399084</link>
    <description>I&#39;m making a secure room opened by a combination of levers, but there is always the weakness that someone can just tunnel in or destroy the door.


How thick would the wall have to be before tunneling through it counts as griefing? What if the wall was made out of something that cannot easily be replaced, like glass or smooth stone? And how many doors would need to be destroyed?


Or would destroying all this be fine because it&#39;s required to gain access to the room? I don&#39;t think it should be allowed, because we&#39;re only allowed to secure one chest so other methods of security should be encouraged (rather than just hiding rooms/chests).</description>

Why don’t you build your structures as you gather resources?  For example while building my castle I would mine cobble at night (either in the ground or at my cobblestone generator) then place it during the day, and repeat.  I never even put any in a chest.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/xray">@Xray</a> and such, there really isn’t anything I can do about it, you guys should be bugging notch about re-writing the server/client in a decent way so as to make Xray and related hacks not work at all, if it was written right in the first place that stuff never would have happened.</p>
<p>Unless of course you have better suggestions?  I’m just not open to a ridiculous rule like if a room is surrounded by glass or smooth stone you can’t break in.<br>

Anti-fly is now supposed to be built into the server.  Link me to the anti-xray one though, the only one I know of doesn’t work for chests.</p>

<p>Yea. Once you use your Lwc once, it can’t be applied to any other standard chests, but can be applied to an infinite number of obsidian chests. True, some players could make a lot of these chests, but it’ll atleast make it slightly harder, but still give the option of item protection.</p>

Anti x-ray is currently not possible because it’s client side. The default minecraft server now comes with anti fly on and it stops you if you stay about 3-4 blocks above a block for a few seconds.</p>

Turns out if you end up not being able to find the block you protected, you’re screwed so yeah thanks for that (I’m not blaming anyone, I looked up the plugin, there is no way to remotely remove a protection)</p>

[/quote]I am building my things as I go collect the resources it’s just annoying. I’m also a good distance away from everyone so I shouldn’t have to worry too much. I’m just not use to not being able to protect my items. Stealing causes alot more problems imo. Because then it brings in other situations like what if the person isn’t online at the time? Or the minimum damage rule. And what if the person peacefully invites the thief into their home? Currently the system leaves people like me who doesn’t raid or hack and only build the short end of the stick.[/quote]</p>
<p>Same here, Im just like you, im the type that tends to keep to themselves, not bother anyone and occasionally invite someone over to see my workings, but it gets annoying when people choose to target your place and come in and fracture your solitude.</p>

It’s more of a question about exactly how much damage people are allowed to do to your buildings to get in, especially if you’ve used better materials. I’m just asking for the ‘minimum damage’ rule to be better defined, and offering my opinion on what it should and should not include.</p>
<p>Does the rule mean that all damage required to gain access to a room is allowed, provided that the damage done is the minimum needed to achieve this? Or does it mean that only reasonable damage is allowed, eg tunnelling through a layer of cobblestone would be fine, but tunneling through layers of obsidian and a number of iron doors would not?[/quote]</p>
<p>Using doors can be worse than blocks in some cases because the person can just throw down a redstone torch and your door is swung wide open. But that’s beside your point, and i have the same view, what extent of breaking and entering becomes griefing?</p>

Another problem I have is I could spend weeks gathering resources for my mega-structures and then someone could just take it all away? How is that even remotely fair? I can’t be online ALL the time to safeguard my place. And I don’t even understand this compulsion to raid and steal from people. Like killing them and taking their items wasn’t enough.</p>
