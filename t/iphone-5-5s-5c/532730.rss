              <p>Here’s how you fix that…</p>
<p>I had the iphone 5 up until last week, however i also had the 4S. I sold my 4S online for a $175… so i was able to keep my current phone until i bought a new one. Bought the 5S for roughly $215, so i only paid ~$35 out of pocket for my new 5S while still retaining my 5. Pretty cool, right? Well I can keep doing this trend, so long as there are people out there still buying the older iphones, one of my favorite parts about it is i still have a ‘backup’ phone in case something happens to my new one.</p>

Can always trust moparscape for a detailed response for these sort of things. Reading through all the posts i have to say that it was extremely interesting to see what you guys had to say. I’ve got my 5C now and i have to say it does not disappoint. the screens display is excellent and the camera is great, apart from a couple of features taken out due to it being a ‘cheaper’ model. However i do strongly recommend it.</p>
<p>Oh and the part were something said your tied into a 2 year contract paying more for the phone…i never heard of Vodafone…50% discount, i’m paying £21 a month over a year.<br>
[/quote] first of all we don’t have a Vodafone and not everybody works for a phone company<br>
Yes 5c doesn’t disappoint if you’ve never used the iPhone 4S and above (iPhone 5=5c but better quality but doesn’t mean 5c is bad)<br>
It’s not worth the upgrade because 5s is out there<br>
Better CPU, better build quality, camera, finger print sensor, gpu, etc<br>
Why would someone get a 5c it’s only 100$ less[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ve owned a 3GS, 4 and 4S all of which i found good at what they did. only issue i found with the 4S is with the ios7 upgrade it seemed to slow down quite a lot and my Facebook etc would take quite a few seconds to kick in. Just because the 5S is out doesn’t mean the 5c isn’t worth it? For one its £100 cheaper and lacks 6-7 features which a 5S has got. So overall the major difference would only be the factor of the finger sensor or the two extra features which the camera has. So in all honesty the 5C in my eyes is the best buy for money. I only say this as from reviews i have read the comments on the fingerprint technology have been labeled a unnecessary feature and i can see where they are coming from to be honest.</p>
<p>Also in comparison from each other the phones differ only a bit but not so much it’s extremely noticeable. i think the main thing which throws people away from the ideas of the 5C, is the plastic casing, because they feel it makes it look cheap but that is the whole point of this version of iphone anyway…for it to be cheap but still a high spec.</p>

<p>Apparently the 5S performs spectacularly running on a 64-bit iOS. Every benchmark comparison I saw had the iPhone 5S at the top. The 5C is still able to hold well too, considering its a better iPhone 5 for half of the price. If Apple keeps up the progress I may end up getting the next iteration of the iPhone just so I can group message friends without the major hassle of MMS handling my phone has, and then keep my current phone or get an android tablet just to have that OS as well.</p>

</aside>
<p>wat. iphone 5 has the same cpu/gpu as the 5c they both rock with A6 chips. I think the iphone 5’s chip is slightly stronger actually by a few points comparing my friend’s 5 and in store 5c.<br>
5S has 64bit architecture or w/e. 1gb graphic memory. Just a way better package than getting a 5c. Looks, quality, camera, fingerprint sensor, gpu, cpu, etc<br>
if you really like the blue color just get a freakin case. whats the point of looking at the phones exterior/ non screen part if you are going to cover it with a case anyways.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Also, the iPhone 5S is running the A7 chip, not the A6: <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/09/27/a-closer-look-at-apples-a7-chip-from-the-iphone-5s/%5B/quote%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.macrumors.com/2013/09/27/a-closer-look-at-apples-a7-chip-from-the-iphone-5s/[/quote]</a><br>
wait what the 5s i never said it ran the a6 chip<br>
maybe it was vague in my statement but i never said it ran the a6 chip<br>
i stated it had a new architecture + more graphic mem should hint immediately that it is a new chip<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/hades">@hades</a> i hope you recognize yourself as hugely biased</p>

<p>My point wasn’t that Apple is unoriginal, it was that they add features at a much slower pace. Even though you can’t argue against the fact they’re unoriginal because, just have a look at their bloody phones…They all look the same…If you go from one iteration of an iphone to the other, it doesn’t really feel like much has changed at all other than a few VERY SMALL things…Also, I don’t just mean going from 4 to 4s or something like that, I mean literally going from 4 to 5, not much at all has changed…You can’t argue against that. Technology evolves and requires change, otherwise people would still be walking around with one of these…</p>

<p>Also, you seem to think that most Android processors are better because they are quad core. Let’s think about this logically for a second - even dual core processors get hot, espeically in a small, enclosed space such as a smartphone. Do you honestly for a second believe that using all 4 cores active would be logical? No, it wouldn’t be. It would generate so much heat in such a small space your phone would overheat without a doubt. The cores may be there, but several are locked. Even on my old HTC Inspire, a single core, 800MHz processor could overheat. When I overclocked it, I nearly bricked my phone because the hardware was unable to cope with the heat. Those extra cores don’t help one bit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, you missed my point entirely, and went off on a tangent about cores. Where did I mention anything about cores AT ALL…?</p>
<blockquote>"Androids" meaning what, the S4? Most Android devices still only come with an 8MP camera sensor, and without broad daylight the quality is sub par. The iPhone 5S's camera has larger pixels, meaning it can take better quality pictures while still retaining the 8MP size. In the HTC One, while they made the pixels larger, they had to downgrade to a 4MP sensor. The sheer number of megapixels doesn't mean anything if the phone isn't able to handle the camera properly. Taking night shots with my HTC One X+ is shitty. The HTC One (And now the iPhone 5S) don't have that problem because of the larger pixels taking in more light. Realistically, that 8MP sensor the iPhone 5S has may just be better than the S4's 13MP sensor.</blockquote>
<p>I fail to see why you would compare a supposed “top of the line” iphone with either an old Android, or a mid-tier budget Android being released for people not willing to drop big bucks on the top of the line stuff. The S4 has 13MP, and so does the HTC one. That’s two more phones for Android than for ios. Not to mention, I’ve not seen any iphone take pics with better quality than my S3. My friend has an iphone 5, I have an S3, both are 8MP, and my pics look better quality and he agrees. Perhaps the 5S can take better pics than my S3 (I haven’t seen any pics off an S3) but it’s not exactly fair to compare a brand new phone to a phone well over a year old now, is it?</p>
<blockquote>I'll give you that, but at least the prices are cut on the previous phone when it still remains steadfast compared to other's today. A 4S is still very good, even though it is 2 iterations behind.</blockquote>
<p>Prices are cut on old Androids too, everything loses value over time. So, what’s your point…?</p>
<blockquote>I'm sorry.. what? Doesn't this apply with nearly every phone on the market? That is the most illogical point I've heard in my life as to why one phone is better or worse than the other. Regardless of what option you take, contract or not, you're still paying for cell phone usage every month which is the same whether there is a contract or not. Buying a phone without a contract is the equivalent to paying for the phone as if you payed for 1 - 2 year's worth of its usage before what you already have to pay monthly. Its asinine.</blockquote>
<p>Based on this reply, I must assume you didn’t bother reading my post at all, but instead just skimmed through it. The point about the contracts no longer had anything to do with why one phone is better than the other. I was simply stating that if you say the absurd prices of the iphone matter not to you because you get it cheap thanks to your contract, then you’re wrong. Also, if you do the math, when you’re locked in to a contract, you actually end up paying more for your phone than if you buy it up front. That’s a well established fact.</p>

Apparently the 5S performs spectacularly running on a 64-bit iOS. Every benchmark comparison I saw had the iPhone 5S at the top. The 5C is still able to hold well too, considering its a better iPhone 5 for half of the price. If Apple keeps up the progress I may end up getting the next iteration of the iPhone just so I can group message friends without the major hassle of MMS handling my phone has, and then keep my current phone or get an android tablet just to have that OS as well.<br>

wat. iphone 5 has the same cpu/gpu as the 5c they both rock with A6 chips. I think the iphone 5’s chip is slightly stronger actually by a few points comparing my friend’s 5 and in store 5c.<br>
5S has 64bit architecture or w/e. 1gb graphic memory. Just a way better package than getting a 5c. Looks, quality, camera, fingerprint sensor, gpu, cpu, etc<br>
if you really like the blue color just get a freakin case. whats the point of looking at the phones exterior/ non screen part if you are going to cover it with a case anyways.[/quote]</p>
<p>Also, the iPhone 5S is running the A7 chip, not the A6: <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/09/27/a-closer-look-at-apples-a7-chip-from-the-iphone-5s/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.macrumors.com/2013/09/27/a-closer-look-at-apples-a7-chip-from-the-iphone-5s/</a></p>

              <p>I’m actually looking to buy my first “real” smartphone with an actual plan. I am really debating on whether or not I want to go with an iPhone and am not sure what is worth getting. I figure I should just buy a new one because I have always found refurbished phones to have poor longevity in the battery and usually end up breaking rather fast. I suppose buying a 5S would be the best option?</p>

              <p>^The 5C has a better battery life apparently. Obviously the 5S outperforms it regardless, but both phones are perfectly viable options.  I think both phones may have gotten the upgraded cameras as well.</p>
<p>Either way, my phone upgrade isn’t available until late 2014. I’ll be waiting for the iPhone 6.</p>
