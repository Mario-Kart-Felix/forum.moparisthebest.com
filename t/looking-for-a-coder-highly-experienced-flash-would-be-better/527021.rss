    <title>Looking for a Coder (Highly experienced, Flash would be better)</title>

    <description>I&#39;m attempting to pull a private server source off the game Naruto-Arena (http://naruto-arena.com/)

I need a coder (willing to pay, obviously) to pull a blank source of the game. I define a blank source as:

Has the server and clients both running.
Has everything set up for development (I.E. It&#39;s ready for me to add characters/missions etc.)
Isn&#39;t absurdly overcomplicated (I can code with RSPS and do a lot of work on servers, I just lack the knowledge on how to build a server for this game from the ground up, considering how unusual it is.)
Can be ran into a web browser.
Has all aspects of gameplay working (I.E. stuns/damage/effects can be coded in without serious problems)

I&#39;m looking to use this to run a site for an Inuyasha version of the game (to counter-part the Bleach and Naruto versions) and would like this person to stay part of the development team.

However much you want for the job, just let me know.
I&#39;ll invest in the online server/website/etc.
I&#39;ll do all the characters and tweaks and updates personally.
Any profit made from the &quot;Donations&quot; section of the site will have a fraction sent to you (I&#39;ll be splitting it evenly among the development team)

Any questions, Or if you want the job, please PM me or post here.

Also, I probably posted this in the wrong section, so correct me if you will.
If you know another site that might have people more in this realm of coding, I&#39;d appreciate it, I know this isn&#39;t the best site to go to but I didn&#39;t know where else to go ^.^

Thanks everyone.</description>
