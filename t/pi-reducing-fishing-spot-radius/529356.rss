    <title>[PI] Reducing fishing spot radius</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-reducing-fishing-spot-radius/529356</link>
    <description>All my fishing spots have a click radius of 3 (by that I mean that 3 squares in every direction around the fishing spot you can still click the fishing spot).
If that isn&#39;t quite clear enough, which I know I would be confused by my explanation...Here is a picture:

Note: The red circle indicates where my mouse is, since my mouse didn&#39;t show up in the picture.
Note2: Notice that even though my mouse is that far out it still shows that I can click on the fishing spot.
Also, it turns out that in certain areas (like in the water) the fishing spots have an even bigger clicking area of 5-6 squares. :(

Long story short:
I need to know how to reduce the clicking area of fishing spots. ;)
Any help is always appreciated. Thank you.


Oh and if you are wondering why I want to change this. It is because when doing custom fishing spots they run into each other and it makes it hard/annoying to click on the spot you actually want to fish at.</description>

I already checked all the NPC and click related things, but you could be right and I passed over it somewhere.<br>
I am checking for distance/fishing spot related things at the moment. Anything in particular you think I should search for to make my efforts more valid?</p>
<p>This is all I can find relating to a few of the fishing spots, and I am 90% sure it doesn’t have to do with the clicking area. (Besides what is in Fishing.java.)</p>
