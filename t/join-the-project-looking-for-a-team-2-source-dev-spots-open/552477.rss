    <description>[size=12pt][b]The Plan[/b][/size]
[b][size=10pt]The plan is too build up an rsps server, and we currently have a decent project. So I have lots of work in progress before the server goes up for live demos! The world will much be build like great rsps servers today eventually, and this is why I want the live demo too be online when this happens, I am not looking for a major successful server, but I want to add what people actually want in the game to make the server somewhat popular! This will make the peoples in-Game experience alot much funner![/size][/b]
