    <title>Need Help with PI base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-pi-base/363048</link>
    <description>Hello, I have started using PI [Project Insanity] for the first time. And since I have been wired with Delta, I am not really having a great time using this base, but I have been astonished from what I have discovered from it so far.
Anyways, @topic.
I have been trying to make a specific weapon safe on death, even if you are skulled and don&#39;t have protect item on.
But I have not discovered how to do so yet, any help? :\</description>
