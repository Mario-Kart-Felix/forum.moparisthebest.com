    <description>hey guys- its been a while since of been on but im having an issue printing wireless.

The issue is the printer is Offline. Iv tried just about everything but cannot seem to get it Online. If someone can remotely help me or just please tell me what to do? I have TeamViewer so if anyone who thinks they can help me, just PM me and ill give you the ID and password to connect with me. I have a Canon MG2200 series Printer. It shows up on the Devices List but it also displays &quot;Offline&quot;.

Thanks guys ^_^ i hope this is the right section to post in for this.</description>

<p>Pretty much the same thing happened to me when I was messing with my printer yesterday. My printer had an IP and I could get to the web interface but I couldn’t get it to print until I had hooked up the USB cable and set the printer up again. After that I was able to print wirelessly again.</p>

              <p>If this is a usb printer let’s try a couple of items</p>
<p>First off, the easiest part…</p>
<p>Go to printer and faxes and right click that printer and click “online/offline”</p>
<p>If it doesn’t come on let’s check your services. Go to run -&gt; and type in “services.msc” go down to printer spooler and see if running/restarting fixes it.</p>
