    <title>What phone to buy?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-phone-to-buy/402947</link>
    <description>So recently I was promised that I would buy a new phone and that it can be anything I want. Suggestions anybody? I&#39;m looking for a phone that won&#39;t make me cringe every time i take it out in public, and for one that has a decent battery life. Sound output should be decent as well. Camera is not a huge factor imo, but it would be a nice bonus if it had a good camera too. Also it should be compatible with those mp3 headphones, w/e they&#39;re called.

Suggest pls.</description>

              <p>I was in the exact same situation a few months ago and an HTC Evo 4g from sprint isn’t to bad… I ended up getting one. I think sprints coverage needs to step it up a bit but definately check out some HTC phones. They have a different phone for almost every carrier and they’re most or all 4g. Just find a plan that you get the most of you money and keep in mind what phones look good to you. If you find one you like, watch a review and find the phones pros and cons, every phone has em…just try to find the one that you’ll adjust to the most.</p>
<p>BTW… The EVO 4g is reasonably cheap but it has enough of the good stuff. 8Mp rear camera with dual LED flash and 1.3mp front camera for qik video chats.<br>
Android OS and if your looking for a BIG screen, the evolution will meet your needs with a 4.3 inch screen that broadcasts in 720p and 480p Res.</p>
<p>Great interface but would take some getting used to if you are currently using and iPod touch or something its going to feel mammoth for a while but it has some pretty nice things that make it worth while. If I was you I’d definatly take a look at one.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to post you decision here!</p>

That looks awesome. Only deterrent might be the price, but I was kind of confused by the best deals thing. Does this mean that the best price I can get was the $500 one?</p>
<p>EDIT: oh it’s 500 euros…[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, it probably wouldn’t be that price, depending on if you’re with a contract based company who offers upgrades (of which you’re eligible for) you could receive a reasonable discount.</p>
