    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-of-a-good-coder/421907</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying some things out, pure as experimenting but I&#39;m stuck with a problem.
Some one who&#39;s pretty good at coding and packaging, please PM me.

to not fuck up the help section;
base: delta
problem: Made a few new classes that I would like to put in a new map.
I made a package of all the files, put the ones I wanted in a map in the map with the new package name.
But it doesn&#39;t work.

So would really appreciate if someone could help me for a sec, i&#39;m new to this
