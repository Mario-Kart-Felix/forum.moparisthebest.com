    <description>I really feel unsuccessful and bad about myself when it comes to rsps&#39;s, well basically I own a rsps: rune-battle.com

And ever since I started and rsps, I always putted some money into it. I tried my best at everything. You might find this emotional or something. Well yes, to me it is. I always wanted to have a great and a mature programming team. Everytime I go to google and look @ these servers with 500+ votes and 30+ players. I wonder why I cant achieve that when I did my best. I just opened my rsps rune-battle.com, and im working alone. I havn&#39;t even gotten over 5 players online. 2 years ago the max i ever had online was 20 on my old rsps. I feel unsuccessful and useless. Programming and forum developing are my hobbies. Im only 15 years old and Im really interested in them..

My Wishes and something that I really want to achieve in these things are to have an active community and an rsps. I really want to have a developing team, that doesn&#39;t mean I let the team do everything alone and I watch them by drinking coffee. No, ofcourse I would contribute too. I really want to see something that I own become something big. But I always tend to fail, and now I feel like I just wasted $7 on rune-battle.com, $7 might be nothing, but it kinda means to me, cuz my parents never give me anything online, and I have to get it by making forums for people. I feel like im never going to achieve what I want. Please post and reply on what you think. Seeing alot of people playing and being active on forums that you own with great staff members is something big to me, and I wish I can achieve that.

You dont understand how much this means to me.</description>

              <p>If your looking to make money then host a mine craft server.

<p>A RuneScape private server is something that really doesn’t matter the content, it’s how the server is run. If your staff are perfect and your server is fun, you will have the best server there is. I mean, look at SoulSplit and Near Reality… what content do they have that no-one else has? More or less nothing. Yet they have been the best servers there was for the past X amount of years.</p>
<p>The way you run the server means everything, become the best at management and you’ll be the best server there is.</p>

              <p>For a small beginner server, in order to achieve players, you can’t just expect them to find <span class="bbcode-i">you</span>, you have to find them. Youtube videos take a very long time for players to join, and even if they join, it won’t be a massive crowd of 200+ players. It will be maybe 10 players, of 3 who will stay. R-Locus is good if you have over 1,000 votes. Advertise your server where you are permitted to; for example, in the advertisement section of this forum and advertisement sections on other forums. Don’t go around on other people’s servers spamming your server - that may end up with a ddos if you make a certain faggot upset. It also may fuck with your server’s reputation.</p>
