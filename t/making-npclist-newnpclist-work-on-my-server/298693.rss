    <description>Hi, owner of easyragescape here, just trying to make some funny NPC&#39;s on my serv and I cant edit the names of old NPC&#39;s, so I figure I can make a new NPCList with the right name and same model, and get the proper effect? Instead of Shop_Owner I want Julia_the_Pennywhore, I edited the name on cfg file etc but it doesnt work. if there is better way than this than tell me, if not than id appreciate your help on were to put this!
[code]
        		NPCList newNPCList = new NPCList(527);{

        		newNPCList.npcName = Julia_the_Whore;
        		newNPCList.npcCombat = 12;
        		newNPCList.npcHealth = 150;
        		NpcList[slot] = 6000;
		}[/code]

<p>Anyways, changing the NPC’s display name is client-sided (class5.java) and i don’t think this should be posted here.</p>
