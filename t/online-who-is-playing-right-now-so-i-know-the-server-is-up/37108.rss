    <title>Online...Who is playing right now so I know the server is up?</title>

    <description>Hi guys..

Who here is actually online (playing on) a server using moparscape?I have tried the Status page, but no luck.
I have tried many, but all say down.
I asked this yesterday and the first one people said that they were online it and playing on it worked.
if you could just give me the IP of the one you are playing on just now that would be great!

Cheers,
FaF` ;)</description>
