    <title>Need to make server compatible with Rs-ps</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-to-make-server-compatible-with-rs-ps/402956</link>
    <description>So I can run my server and people have to download a client to play it. No body wants to do that because it is so much easier to just play on a webclient. So i decided to put it on rs-ps . org and I go to play it and nothing happens. I know I need to put something in the Server folder to make it compatible to work on the internet. THe problem is, I don&#39;t know what to add or where/how to add it. So if someone could please respond with a detailed place on where and what to put, or could you Teamview me, and show me so I don&#39;t mess it up to badly  ;). Please respond because that is the final thing i need to let people play it.
