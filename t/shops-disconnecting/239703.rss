    <title>Shops Disconnecting?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shops-disconnecting/239703</link>
    <description>I have had this problem before, but too lazy to post. Anyway, I have had some NPC shops for a while, that just randomly decide to not work. They have worked, but now, when you trade them, they disconnect you.  Don&#39;t know how to fix. Any help will work.

Thanks,
Inferno.</description>

Try changing the NPC Id, then try and split the shop into 2, and if all else fails ask jesus</p>
