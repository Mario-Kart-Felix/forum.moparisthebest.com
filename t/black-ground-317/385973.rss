    <title>Black ground? 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/black-ground-317/385973</link>
    <description>So most places seem fine, but a couple specific areas in falador (west and south of a certain spot) seem to have black ground when you tele to them, tele to someone who is there, or login in those areas... It fixes itself if you tele away and tele back, but why does it do that? How could I fix?
