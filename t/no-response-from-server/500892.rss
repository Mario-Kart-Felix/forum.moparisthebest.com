    <title>&quot;No response from server...&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-response-from-server/500892</link>
    <description>So like the title says.. I keep getting &quot;No response from server. Please try using a different world.&quot; when I try to log in to my server. I&#39;ve gotten it to work before last year but after I turned my computer off a few days after, I got this error again.. Not remembering how I fixed this problem, I tried countless things that I thought I might have done but with no results. :/ after about a month of trying to get it back online I gave up and was too frustrated to try any more. So here I am a year later trying to do it again and still getting frustrated because nothing is working and I&#39;m almost positive everything is set up as it should be.

I&#39;m sure I port forwarded correctly. I went to canyouseeme.org and it said port 43594 was open. I have the client ip set to my no-ip in the client.java folder. I tried setting it to local but I still got this message.

This is the source and client I&#39;m using:

Anything I may have forgotten? Any help is appreciated.</description>

<p>Changed IP to 127.0.0.1 on all client.java files ( If you have more client.java’s )<br>

<p>Do you use Wireless lan? (WLAN) ?<br>
If yes, the ip does not stay 192.168.1.(IP END)<br>
Lets say you have currently set up the ip (in portforwarding section) 192.168.1.10<br>
Your ip is changing example : all 2 days<br>
You need to get your currently ip then, fix that 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.15 ( EXAMPLE )<br>
To get your ip thingy go to cmd&gt;ipconfig /all and then search for it</p>
<p>If it’s still not fixed use an other client ( was problem at mine client too )[/quote]I only have 1 client.java and it didn’t work when I set the ip to local. I am running this on a laptop so yes it’s wireless. So do I need a static ip then? I tried that once before and it fixed the problem but after I couldn’t connect again I tried setting another static ip but it didn’t work that time? My router’s ip has always been 192.168.2.1. I already went to cmd and the ip was the same as I was putting. Lastly, I’ve tried using probably over 20 different packages but the client always says the same thing. I don’t think it’s a problem with the client because I’ve gotten it running on this client before, I just don’t know how I did it. Any other ideas? Would you be willing to TeamView?</p>
