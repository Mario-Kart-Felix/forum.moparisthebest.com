I made a  on RSPS  and I tried to get on it after changing the IP in Gui.java and Client.java
 
I tried to connect to my server on the  and it said &quot;No response from server. Please try using a different world.&quot;
 
I used my no-ip as the IP for the and saw a few threads about this problem and I had my friends test it out and it said the same thing for them.
 
I have uTorrent and No-Ip running and full functioning, all ports forwarded, and the status checker on google says my server is online; the same with RSPS 
 
My friends can&#39;t connect, I can&#39;t connect. What am I doing wrong?? Everything is working according to the server checkers and port forward checkers.
 
This is so frustrating!!</description>
