        <p>To set the quest stage, do this:<br>
player.quests.set(CooksAssistant.id, 1)</p>
<p>The breath method just does a short pause. It’s essentially just Thread.sleep(1800).</p>
<p>Brackets work the same way as Java. So, things like this won’t work as intended:<br>
if (player.getInventory.remove(19, 1) //egg<br>
player.sendmessage<br>
this &gt; “I have an egg”; breath</p>
<p>You’d need to do this:<br>
if (player.getInventory.remove(19, 1) {<br>
this &gt; “I have an egg”; breath // this is 2 statements, so you need the curly brackets.<br>
}</p>
<p>Also, you can’t do an else after a method.</p>
<p>Anyway, just write it as you would in Java. You just need to adjust the way things are declared, and it should be fine. Also, look at the <a href="https://github.com/Lothy/MoparClassic/blob/pre-beta/GameServer/src/org/moparscape/msc/gs/model/dialog/NpcDialog.scala" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">NpcDialog class</a> for methods that can be used.</p>
