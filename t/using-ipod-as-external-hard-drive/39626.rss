    <title>Using iPod as external hard drive?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/using-ipod-as-external-hard-drive/39626</link>
    <description>I just got an 80 GB Video iPod for Christmas, and I plugged it in and copied music etc. and whatever.

Later I was installing some programs on my computer, and I had to go to My Computer to apply a crack for a program. Well, along with my C:, D:, and my virtual CD drives, I saw a G: drive, which was named zPod (z for Zach). I went into it and it acted like any other external hard drive.

So, basically what I&#39;m asking, is it safe to copy any files to it (programs etc.) and use it to backup things if I need to reformat my computer or something? If so, then it has just saved me a few bucks, because I was planning on buying a 60 GB external hard drive.



And another thing, does the iPod itself have an actual hard drive, or just a flash drive? I noticed when I copy songs to it, it makes those clicking sounds just like the hard drive in your computer does (except quieter).</description>

<p>good luck fitting a hard drive on an ipod?</p>

<li>
<p>It would probably cost a LOT more money to fit 80 GB on a flash drive (I’m assuming)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why would a flash drive make the signature “clicking” sounds?</p>
