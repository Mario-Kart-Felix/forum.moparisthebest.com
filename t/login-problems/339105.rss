    <description>Well i used to code private servers but i started to migrate away from it, but now im back ^^. Well I downloaded a new client and server but when i set the ip on my Gui class to 127.0.0.1 i have no problem logging in but when i set it to my ip from no-ip DUC it says the server is offline. I have checked my port forwarding and ipconfig on my command prompt the ips are both set to 103 so i dont know why i cant log in =(. Is there anything else that i have to change that im not remembering? Please help, thanks</description>
