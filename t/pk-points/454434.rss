    <description>I have not done ANYTHING to this source or client...
But how can I fix this?
Whenever I die in wildy, Whether a monster or player... We both get pkp points with PvP.. and I get pk points dying from a monster...
Say player 1 kills player 2.. They both get PKP points.. Same from dying from a monster you get pk points... How could I fix this?
This is &quot;Hybrid PvP V3&quot;

and this is my entire ApplyDead method...
[code]
    public void applyDead() {    
        c.respawnTimer = 10;
        c.isDead = false;
        if(c.duelStatus != 6) {
            //c.killerId = c.getCombat().getKillerId(c.playerId);
            c.killerId = findKiller();
            Client o = (Client) Server.playerHandler.players[c.killerId];
            if(o != null) {
                if(!(c.npcIndex &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; c.inPits == false){
                }
                if (c.killerId != c.playerId)
                    o.sendMessage(&quot;You have defeated &quot;+Misc.optimizeText(c.playerName)+&quot;!&quot;);
                                if(c.inWild()){
                                        c.pkPoints += 5;
                                        o.sendMessage(&quot;You have received 5 Pk Points&quot;);
                                }
                c.playerKilled = c.playerId;
                if(o.duelStatus == 5) {
                    o.duelStatus++;
                }
            }
        }
        c.poisonDamage = 0;
        c.faceUpdate(0);
        c.npcIndex = 0;
        c.playerIndex = 0;
        c.stopMovement();
        if(c.duelStatus &lt;= 4) {
            c.sendMessage(&quot;Oh dear you are dead!&quot;);
        } else if(c.duelStatus != 6) {
            c.sendMessage(&quot;You have lost the duel!&quot;);
        }
        resetDamageDone();
        c.specAmount = 10;
        c.getItems().addSpecialBar(c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon]);
        c.lastVeng = 0;
        c.vengOn = false;
        resetFollowers();
        c.attackTimer = 10;
	removeAllWindows();
	c.tradeResetNeeded = true;
  	}
[/code]

<p>As you may notice by observing the applyDead method, The client object “c” is the player who’s being killed, and the client<br>
object “o” is the player receiving the kill. If you look at the block of this if statement, you will notice that the client object<br>
“c” is having it’s pkPoint variable incremented, and client object “o” is receiving the message. So what does this mean? Let me simplify it for you</p>
<p>According to this if statement, if the player who died is in the wild, they will receive pk points and their killer will receive a message<br>
saying “You have received 5 Pk Points”.</p>
