    <title>PK Points</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-points/255445</link>
    <description>Is there a way to add PK points, like you get 3 points for every kill.
And every time you kill someone it appears on screen saying something like &quot;Demise has just killed (PlayerName), Demise now has (numberofkills) and (numberofpoints).

Cheers. ;)</description>

              <p>what server are you on? i added something like this to my delta base, just without the "demise has just killed (playername). That tends to spam the chat if alot of people are pking. Just let me know what source you are using and i can help.</p>
