    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-language-should-i-learn/376162</link>
    <description>Heyy, I saw the section and I&#39;m tempted to learn a language..  Which one should I learn, I&#39;m kinda tempted to start with java.   Is there a certain one to learn where everything else is easier?</description>

Learning a programming language is not an easy thing, mastering it is like trying to learn a oriental language, not very easy. My best advice to give you is try working with the language you choose head on, study the text and format of which it’s written in. Try taking a statement within the language and try spacing it out and learning which each part means in the language, and remember that the format of every programming language is built in a fashion where each part is dependent on a previous or containing part in the language text. For a first language, i’d have to say Python would be the easiest and such, you shouldn’t just jump into C or something. After learning Python if you’re still interested in learning more languages go ahead and try out Java, it’s fairly easier to comprehend and learn once you’ve studied Python for awhile.</p>
<p>Hope this helped ^^.</p>

              <p>Personally, I prefer English, It is compatible with most countries. But if you wish, Spanish is around 2nd or 3rd most compatible. Japanese might be fun to learn tho.</p>
<p>Oh Programming language? I prefer Java XD. But it more depends on what you are learning it for, I think for RSPS its easier for java, kinda my personal opinion. But in today’s world, C# is becoming more popular, Idk why. It is very similar to Java, however, as of the moment, I am failing at it XD however I have coded SOME C#. – So I suggest Java.</p>

<p>Call of Duty is a <span class="bbcode-b">console</span> game.<br>
Halo is a <span class="bbcode-b">console</span> game.</p>
<p>You do realize that on consoles, the only language developers <span class="bbcode-b">can</span> use is C. I also hope you realize that consoles games are very different than computer games, and that this person won’t want to develop console games (as this would be his first programming language, and he has no experience with game development.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/world">@World</a> of Warcraft: it has less members than Minecraft’s and Runescape’s.[/quote]Why do you think consoles use C++? because it has a lot more potential then java.<br>
and i’m talking about ACTIVE USERS, NOT ACCOUNTS MADE. All of Blizzards games are ran in C++ from knowledge, and they run a lot more smoothly then runegays.</p>
<p>**Oh and are you aware runescape uses a different scripting language then java? Because it limited them.</p>

Do you think it will be a predominant part of your working life, or do you just want to enhance your problem solving skills?
<p>In case you chose the latter, such high-level interpreted programming languages as Lisp or Python should be your choice; but if you are passionate about programming per se and your goal is trying to understand the low-level mechanisms that make your PC work, the C programming language is the right option for you.</p>

<p>Nice Google search. Also, Java will get you farther since it is the most common for game development. C++ has been used for security programs over game development.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re also an idiot. Name a few popular games written in Java(other than Runescape). Almost all commercial desktop applications are written in C++(this includes games). And what exactly is a ‘security program’?</p>

google search?  how arrogant can you get?  please stop repeating yourself, as you haven’t given any facts at all, and you’re taking what I said, but rewording everything.  if you have no idea what you’re talking about, then just don’t reply.  and java is not the common game development language used.  I don’t know why you’re actually comparing the languages themselves, as they both can do almost anything the other one can do, except that C++ supports pointers and java doesn’t (that’s just one of them), anyway.  c++ supports multiple gapi’s, as java only supports one.</p>

[/quote]<br>
I doubt you do either.</p>
<p>If you want to learn C++, it’s good if you’re already knowledgeable enough with Java. Likewise if you want to learn Java. Their syntaxes are similar, because Java is derived from it. The only thing that’s been confusing to me in C++ is using pointers/references.[/quote]I actually tampered with C++ long before i even opened up my first java file.</p>
