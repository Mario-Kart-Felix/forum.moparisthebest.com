[size=14pt]Main&#39;s 100% Color ClanWar Fighter Post Nuke Beta[/size]

[B]Works after the bot nuke! [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1szB3mYDBmI](Video)[/url][/B][/center] 

Why should you use this script?:
 ~ Its safe and very human like ( Got some little bugs that I will fix soon).
 ~ Many players play this legit for many hours a day.
 ~ No need for food:P
 ~ Safer than fight cave.
 ~ Unlike fight cave which is P2P only, this can be done at both F2P AND P2P even with level 3!
 ~ 100% Color :P Which means it doesn&#39;t need to update every time rs updates.
              For Example: The primary functions of this script has been working SINCE august 2010!!!
 ~ It will work after the so called Oct 25th update:P

Functions:
 ~ Fights the free for all portal at clan war.
 ~ Works in both P2P and F2P.
 ~ Safe, decent speed  [S]and will leave the red portal if ever accidentally entered.[/S] (&lt;- Stops script for now :redface:).
 ~ Use quick prayer.
 ~ Worldswitcher [SRL&#39;s not working or something atm].
 ~ Use special attack  [UpComing].
 ~ SRL Stats  [UpComing].
 ~ Progress report  [UpComing].
 ~ Set attack style and trains multiple combat skills [UpComing].

How to use:
 ~ Once logged in, [B][color=red]pick the world ( 129 for P2P and 50 for F2P)[/color][/B], you only need to do at the beginning of running the script.
 ~ Starts any where within game grotto near or within clan war.
 ~ Set your quick prayer if you wish to use. 
 ~ Try to avoid super expensive and high defence armour, Due to the way I use to detect fight, if no one can hit you (I.E if you are 99 defence, with full bandos and elysian shield), it can cause a little problem, but even so, it would still be ok and safe to use.
 ~ Set up these:
[code]
Const
  ShowDebugGFX = True;

Function LocateMe: Integer; Forward;

procedure LesGoat;
Begin
  HowManyPlayers := 1;
  NumberOfPlayers( HowManyPlayers);
  CurrentPlayer := 0;

  Players[ 0].Name :=&#39;&#39;;
  Players[ 0].Pass :=&#39;&#39;;
  Players[ 0].Nick :=&#39;&#39;;
  Players[ 0].Active := True;
  Players[ 0].Booleans[ 0] := True; //True for P2P, False for F2P.
  Players[ 0].Booleans[ 1] := False; //Turn on XP TAB? *** If you normally play with it on, please set this to true.
  Players[ 0].Booleans[ 2] := True;  //Quick Pray? Please set it up. If you don&#39;t know what quick pray is then leave it as false.

End;     [/code]

Please comment on what you would like to see, and if you&#39;d like to report a problem. Post the debug and the screen shot (if you could manage, remember to block off your name) and I will look to fix it.


[B]Note: I highly recommend using this in F2P as you get a lot more exp. Unless you are lvl 120+ (without summoning) you should really consider using this in F2P even if you are P2P.
Since the update, the speed of botting has dramatically decreased, so hopefully there will be improvement on the speed and I might make an other update to fix all the little buggers thats in this script.[/B]
