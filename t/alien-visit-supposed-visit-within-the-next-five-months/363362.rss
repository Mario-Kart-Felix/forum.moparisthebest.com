    <title>Alien Visit? Supposed visit within the next five months</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/alien-visit-supposed-visit-within-the-next-five-months/363362</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Recent light has been shed on the reason that the SETI (Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) project has been cancelled by the government. It seems that something was starting to happen. According to my sources the government black project boys have taken over some of the antennas and are now processing signals for the exclusive use of the United States Navy. The government seems to be highly upset that more than one very large object is fast approaching Earth.

Speculation about just what these objects may be; some more absurd than others. They range from Ark ships that are coming to take away some people just before a cataclysmic event strikes earth. Another speculation suggest that we are about to be invaded and the people of Earth forced into slave labor, or some Scifi fantasy such as that. Although it is unlikely (by unlikely, I mean it&#39;s very, very, very unlikely) we may be plundered or saved. Either way the near future is yet to unfold.

At the present time the object(s) are beyond the orbit of Pluto. It is estimated that the objects are in the neighborhood of  our very own star system. They are an estimated 150 miles across by 30 to 50 miles wide. Not long ago a Russian Mars probe photographed an object fitting this description just before it was destroyed for unknown reasons. Later, an American Mars probe was destroyed just before it reached that planet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I am a very big sceptic on not if intelligent life other than ours exists, but of this certain event. Mind you, all of this is merely my own observation.  and opinion. Nothing more. You are welcome to share you opinions, or even give your own skepticism. I have no problem with that.

Go on http://www.sky-map.org

Type any of the following coordinates listed below:


19 25 12, -89 46 03 - First big object

16 19 35, -88 43 10 - Cylindrical object

02 26 39, -89 43 13 - Circular object


I&#39;m sure you get the jist of it. I assure these are not nebula, nor are they any other spatial formation I have heard of. And they appear to be changing trajactory / moving. And they&#39;re getting closer. Other coordinates are below:

8 50 47, -89 38 09

14 38 50, -88 40 42  14 59 06, 

-88 21 24  23 13 00, -88 53 11

19 26 51, -88 42 38 



Go ahead and see for yourself. Hell, go and look on Google Space for all I care. The truth is that I do not know what this is.

 I have posted, and heard from numerous forums, message boards, and image boards about this. A lot of people are now getting into it (not by my influence, unfortunately)

. I am surprised that there is little attention about this. Of all the places I have posted this, there has been allegations made that it will arrive in the aforementioned time date I have provided in the title. 


Go with peace, everyone.

<p>Go ahead and see for yourself. Hell, go and look on Google Space for all I care. The truth is that I do not know what this is.</p>
<p>I have posted, and heard from numerous forums, message boards, and image boards about this. A lot of people are now getting into it (not by my influence, unfortunately)</p>
<p>. I am surprised that there is little attention about this. Of all the places I have posted this, there has been allegations made that it will arrive in the aforementioned time date I have provided in the title.</p>
<p>Go with peace, everyone.</p>
