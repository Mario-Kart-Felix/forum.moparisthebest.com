    <title>The castle project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-castle-project/366987</link>
    <description>I dont know what inspired me to do this, but i guess i went back into my VFX self for a bit. There are alot of flaws in this castle. Took me a bit to actually break the tiling of the stone texture on the walls but i still think it came out decent. I would have put alot more work into it had i known it would look this good in the end. ALOT of post effects were involved, the renders only really got the castle in as youll see below.

A few people had some trouble actually seeing what was made by me and what wasnt (success?). The castle is all CG.

Making of below :)

              <p>Rendered in C4D with basic AR3, but Photoshop really made it match. It actually took a bit of thinking to get the castle base line to look natural, i eventually went with using a soft eraser to make the brick blend into the mud. The texture is actually a combination of about 6 different layers, all layer in C4D itself. My original plan was to just put the castle in an empty field and make it look old, but all that did was make it stand out way to much. Along with that, the castle wasnt built to sit on the field at the angle the field was going at. I might try to revisit that, see how good i can get it to look.</p>

<p>What did you render in? You had a great matte line to separate your element from the rest, I’d like to see what you can do without something that easy to comp in.</p>
<p>I’ve had little time for VFX related stuff lately, thus the not posting much. With me doing stuff like that everyday at work, it’s changed what I do in my free time. Instead of doing more of it at home, I’ve branched out into learning more things and different kinds of animation.</p>
<p>I’ve switched to Renderman completely now. I’m also writing shaders for it as well. I have a few little shaders which are just helpful and one big shader which is pretty sweet and saves a lot of time. I’ve been working on some character animation (which I just set rendering on the farm, expect that soon) on a few short films.</p>
<p>Anyways. Good job.</p>

<p>It really does look amazing. Only thing I that for some reason sticks out to me is this,</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tfmjK.png" alt width="386" height="282"></p>
<p>It’s almost as if it’s a tiny bit transparent? Or maybe it’s because the texture isn’t as apparent there… Not sure. Something about it just seems blurry to me <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>But I’m just being picky, lol. It really does look great.</p>
