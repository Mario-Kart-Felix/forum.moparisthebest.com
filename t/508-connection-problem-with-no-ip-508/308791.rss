    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-connection-problem-with-no-ip-508/308791</link>
    <description>Ok so, for some reason when other people use my no-ip for an Ip Changer it says its offline. I portfowarded (I&#39;m pretty sure it was right because it problem there, I have  no-ip DUC and have a face checked off (the face that they are trying to connect through), I have Utorrent set up, I have my server running, but it still doesn&#39;t work, is there an error in the portfowarding? Is there a problem with any specific thing? Or is it just the fact that i&#39;m trying to run it? Please help me, Thanks,

              <p>sometimes if you reset your router or there is a power outage your default gateway will change, thus making your server offline. Try checking your portforwarding one more time and if it doesnt work im not sure what to tell you ^.^</p>
