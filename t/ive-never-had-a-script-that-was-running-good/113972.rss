    <title>I&#39;ve never had a script that was running good</title>

    <description>Hi, 

I&#39;m new to scar and I got scar divi 3.06, I downloaded SRL too and did that test if SRl works, well it did.
I downloaded some scripts from this forum (scripts that run good for other people) but I always get errors but I&#39;d have all the things for that script.......

I need help  :P

Because I want to run a nice script too :)</description>
