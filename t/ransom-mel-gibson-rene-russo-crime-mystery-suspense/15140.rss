    <description>Ransom - Mel Gibson - Crime/Mystery/Suspense

This movie is brilliant. It&#39;s about millionaire Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) and Kate Mullen (Rene Russo) who&#39;s child was kidnapped, and Tom and Kate are dedicated to do ANYTHING to get their son back.

This movie is very intense. If you are into Crime and Mystery and Suspense mixed in, you have got to see this movie. It&#39;s about as intense as heat and very entertaining. Not entertaining because thier son was captured, but entertaining because of all rush rush action and mystery and trying to find out who captured him, what&#39;s going to happen next, will the kid die, will Tom pay the ransom. What&#39;s going to happen..??? WHAT!?!!?

For more information: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117438/

I could not find a torrent for the movie. Sorry.</description>
