    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-to-know-if-my-ideas-are-possible/437875</link>
    <description>OKay just letting every body know i have not and cant start working on my coding my new rsps yet cause my computer crashed and im using brothers but i will start soon as i save money for new computer.

I want to know if i will be able to do my ideas and if anybody knows how will you be able to explain how by steps over a quick chat or somthing when i start working on it.

My plan is to probley use the original delta or somthing like it and with the ideas i got it work look anything like deltascape, 2speced, united pkz, or any of them related servers.

Here are few of ideas (ill add more if people actually take me seriously on this thread)
-completly take godswords and other iteams out of the game.
-connect the mining guild ladded to a different one like one in vorrock west bank for example, so that if you click on stairs in vorrock west bank it takes you to mining guide + other way around.
-Make smite the highest prayer. (my server is gonna be old school like based on kid ranqe pking time. (2004 or so, like when i played rs)
-check and change clue scroll rewards
-change the clue spots and change how the clues work.
-make a manual/book in your inv. when you start and make it say whatever i want.
-make it to where quest cape is still in game but you can get or use it till you got 5+ 99skills.

*Thats end of the list and if people really awnser me seriously then ill add more, just dont want this to turn into one of them random threads where people just fighting and stuff*

If this thread gets outa control ill post my email so anybody actually wanting to help can still get in touch with me.</description>

<p>Answered in accordance to the order you posted in.</p>
<p>-Yes, simply remove anything relating to godswords from the source code.<br>
-Yes, have the object teleport you to the coordinates of your choosing.<br>
-Yes, remove all other prayers.<br>
-Yes, depending on how you build/the server has cluescrolls set-up you’ll build onto the array of items (probably how they’re stored).<br>
-Yes, will vary depending on the source, you don’t have much information right now though so I can’t really help you.<br>
-Yes, when you click the item have an interface pop-up, write to that interface.<br>
-Yes, check the players skills, if they have &gt;= 5 skills over 99, then allow them to wear the cape, } else { tell them they cannot.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to increase the perspective of your ideas as these are pretty generic and aren’t very unique.</p>
