    <description>Hello, I need a bit of help.
I&#39;ve made a dicing zone, but people keep spam trading the dicers, so I want to make it so only Dicers can trade to prevent spam traders.
Also, how do I make it so there is a gfx around the dicers so the players know who the trusted dicers are, so they are not to get scammed.
If you could help, I would love you forvever :hurr:
Thanks in advance!</description>

              <p>For the trading you’ll need a check to see if they’re a trusted player.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (!trustedPlayer &amp;&amp; inDicing) {
sendMessage("Only the hosts can trade.");
return;
} else {</code></pre>
<p>This checks if they’re not a trusted player within that specific area and sends the message if they try and trade.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int gfxTimer=200;

if (gfxTimer &gt; 0) {
gfxTimer--;
}

if (trustedPlayer &amp;&amp; gfxTimer == Misc.random(200)) {
//gfx stuff
gfxTimer=200;
}</code></pre>
<p>May need tweaking, especially the gfx thing, not sure if it will work</p>

I’m sorry, I’m new to coding. I don’t get how to add this, and it wouldn’t be a bad idea. Because, the user would just ask to dice, then if the host wants to, he will trade.</p>
