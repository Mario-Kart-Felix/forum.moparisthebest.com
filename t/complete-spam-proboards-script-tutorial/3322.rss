    <description>[center][size=20pt][b]Script/Tutorial on SPAMMING PROBOARDS![/b][/size][/center]

NO BUGS! This script works perfectly now. It uses Alt commands to post and does it nicely. This version is now complete. :)

Learn about procedures, key down, key up, alert messages, variables, constants, writing to the debug window, clearing the debug window, and sendkeys. Enjoy.

Latest instructions and other information is in the code. Just copy and paste the code into Scar. This code has been formatted and commented for your convenience.

Here is the script:
[code]
{.Script Info:
# ScriptName   = SpamProboards
# Author       = Ron (from www.moparisthebest.com/smf)
# Description  = AutoSpammer for ProBoard&#39;s Forums (www.proboards.com).
                 This is also good for people learning SCAR scripting.
# Version      = 1.00 and Complete
# Last Update  = June 1, 2006 at 9:14 PM.
# Comments     = Just change Msg to whatever message you want sent.
# Script Link  = http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,3706.0.html
# Requirements = Quick Reply Form open at the very bottom.
# Instructions = 1. Minimize all the windows, and move the target on to the entire
                 screen.
                 2. Go to your friend&#39;s ProBoard forums and go into a topic.
                 3. Maximize your forum window.
                 4. Setup the Const on line 27.
                 5. Then run the script.
# NEED HELP?   = Go to the Script Link and post your problem if you have any.
# Known Bugs   = None so far.
