    <title>Save spawned objects in characters file</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/save-spawned-objects-in-characters-file/404745</link>
    <description>How can I make it so when a person (an admin) spawns an object (e.g a prayer altar) the object is saved to his character file and it shows up only when he is logged in. So when an admin types ::object (id) the object is spawned and saved to his character file and the object is shown only when the person is logged in.
Plz help</description>
