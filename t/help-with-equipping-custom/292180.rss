    <title>Help with equipping custom</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-equipping-custom/292180</link>
    <description>Hello, i just started doing the Custom part of my server, i have made 2 items for testing... D Claws and Death Cape. I want to know two things. They aren&#39;t going into the right spot. I need help with that.

1. Is it the Item4.java that edit&#39;s where like the cape goes in to cape and claws goes into weapon? (i already know you don&#39;t need to touch the claws)

2. How do i fix it.

Tip: I did do the Item4.java thing (put in 9119 [Death Cape Code for my server] under the &#39;Capes&#39; part. But it won&#39;t work. I&#39;m using Galkons client, and using AllStar V2 source. Please help.</description>
