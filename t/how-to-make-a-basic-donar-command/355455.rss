    <title>How to make a basic donar command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-basic-donar-command/355455</link>
    <description>DISCLAIMER=================================================================================
Don&#39;t say this is common sense or stupid, after surfing the forum for an hour i found that many people dont know how to do this.
==========================================================================================
Difficulty:[b]1/10[/b] 
[b]What you need to use/know[/b]
Basic copy and paste
java
========================================================================================
This is a simple command i have pulled from my server, it teleports you to dzone.
      if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;NAME LIKE ANY OTHER COMMAND&quot;) &amp;&amp; donator == 1) {
triggerTele(coor, coor, 0);

Copy and paste this under your commands, then just change the name like any other command and add coords.
the most important part is the [b]donator == 1)[/b] without this (common sense) any one will be able to tele there, make sure it is donator ==1 not donator == 0 or &quot;anyone&quot; could tele there.
if you would like to turn this into a mod+ command just change donator to player rights == 1 or player rights == 2 or for owner player rights == 3</description>
