    <description>Ok so my problem is,
 I had my 317 running and i was going to switch it to a more updated version (562). And the 562 is having the error_game_js5connection (and yes i know what it means it isnt connecting) but i dont know how to fix it (Btw im pretty new at doing this stuff). So i have heard it was my Environmental Variables and i have played with them but it isnt working!
But anyhow...CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP I WILL TEAMVIEW WILL THEM OR ANYTHING IF YOU KNOW HOW TO FIX THE 562 TELL ME PLEASE. THE SERVER I USED AS A BASE WAS ELEMENT-X. (I also have msn if you want to reach me or me reach you there)</description>
