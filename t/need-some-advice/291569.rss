    <description>Long story short I had a bit of a problem and needed to reset my bios, and while I was opening the case I noticed the little plastic cover for the sata cable was missing, I straightened the pins and placed the clip back on and it seems fine now, but will this cause any problems later on?</description>

<p>Haha, since when?  I went into a radioshack about a month ago and asked for a SATA cable, the guy had no idea what I was talking about, and when I explained what it was he said they don’t sell computer parts anymore.  An example of a previously nice store, turning into a horrible store.</p>

<p>It’s sad, I went into Radioshack a couple days ago for the first time in two years.

Their parts drawers are missing some of the most important stuff.</p>
<p>You’re actually able to get more Computer parts at Walmart than Radioshack.[/quote]<br>
At least you don’t live in the UK where the only places to get computer parts are the internet and nigger stalls.</p>
