    <description>Hi Im currently recruiting a server development team the project name is SuperScape. It is a 317 server if you are interested feel free to apply.IT IS NEW AND UNIQUE SO APPLY NOW SO YOU DONT MISS OUT ON ANYTHING. It is an awesome oopertunity I haven&#39;t started on the client one bit i am waiting for an active crew so I can start from scratch with my team. For a quick guide about what we will be working on will be basically a 317 with some 508 graphics we as a team will try our best to put a working grand exchange in. We will also try to auto ban or auto disallow spamming for example. If a player is saying the same word 5 times or more than once they will be auto-muted for 10 minutes.
We as a team will discuss more ides and fix/improve things right way and the best way

Thanks ~ okya</description>
