So anyway I have never been able to make a webclient with either of these. I get different errors with each one so anyway im just going to stop typing and stuff and say if you are experienced and are willing to make a webclient for me that includes the html applet code i will pay you if necessary... 

Problem 317:

Loads fine in jar file and everything but doesn&#39;t work when i attempt to put it into a webhost...

problem 667/704:
