    <title>No residence property</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-residence-property/441132</link>
    <description>in W1, no residence, no chests, no sign of life, and its full of rich iron blocks so I&#39;m taking them all.

Had a talk with Zuppers and even Davidi2 to run past if it was against the rules, as far as we&#39;re concerned it&#39;s fine. They deserve it anyway, all they do is fly hack and cheat. 

Don&#39;t know who owns it, theres a few people in that area but, when he notices the server has helped itself to his blocks he&#39;s gonna obviously report it, so I&#39;m just gonna post once then ignore him.

I&#39;m pretty sure Moparisthebest will have no issue with this - though, Mopar, if you do I&#39;d like to remind you about my mob tower near your house in W1.

Have a nice day all.</description>

              <p>Uhh, these people…</p>
<p>They’ve already replaced almost the entire eagle in a few days, that’s 4 stacks of iron blocks. They claimed they have an iron farm, after later asking the people who live there and are building it they claim no such thing exists.</p>
<p>It’s just one person says this, another says the polar opposite, half of them don’t know where they are, and the rest can’t speak fluent English. I went to inspect their eagle in sneak mode, they all <em>somehow</em> managed to spot me through 3 walls and ran directly to me.</p>
<p>Pretty sure I caught one of them flying again too though I’ll bring further video evidence forward for that within the coming days. I’m telling you, I’m 99.9% sure they’re up to something again and I will prove it in due time.</p>
<p>As for others suspected of cheating such as:</p>
<p>Summerwine1<br>
DWD</p>
<p>I’ve moved my IG player into their mines and local area so will be inspecting to find out what exactly is going on and if they’re influencing anybody else to cheat if found cheating. Aside from that the next person to look at is jrub with his stacks of diamond blocks on W2.</p>
<p>These modifications just ruin this server, I hoped it wouldn’t come to me doing this but every other plugin is useless and does little to help us against most issues. The more effective deterrent is to send a clear message stating we’re not having this on moparcraft anymore.</p>

<p>Whenever I see them they’re not even speaking English, I’ve had my property griefed by them while they were cheating on more than two occasions, they’ve attacked myself and Si force while fly hacking, they’ve helped people ban evade, they’ve wasted my time by lieing to me about who people are, they were caught flying again after just being banned, needless to say I’m sick of this “I can cheat, get banned, but I keep the cheated things” ideal, I’m sorting these Spanish idiots out once and for all now.</p>
<p>And the only way to do that is to hit them where it hurts, the pocket. Once they’re back to ground level they either play properly or be banned again.</p>
