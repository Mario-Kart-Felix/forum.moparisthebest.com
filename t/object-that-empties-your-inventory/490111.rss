    <title>Object that empties your inventory!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/object-that-empties-your-inventory/490111</link>
    <description>Hello I was trying to add an object that would empty your inventory in the game.
But I cannot seem to figure out the right code to implement this into my server.

If anyone could be of assistance that would be great.
I am using a PI source base currently.</description>
