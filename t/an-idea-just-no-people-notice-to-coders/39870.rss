    <description>I couldn&#39;t not find a forum to post it in well it&#39;s here if you like it or not. :P

Anyway I was just playing my RuneScape version and I was thinking about getting the whole forum together to combine there projects and put it in one. I am currentley using the wolf project which seems to be less buggy so far so I thought we could get the team to code there projects into the wolf one.
My point is if we made one big open source package we could cure hundreds of bugs, make new towns, items, quests. Not only that we should code a Admin/Moderator CP *similar to the one on runescape* but it allows you to add additional items top up on coins etc. I think if we got motivated it would be a great project and best of all we could keep on building on it and improving it. 

Here are my ideas.

-Make a Admin/Moderator CP remote login.
* Ban users.
*Disconnect them.
*Edit bank, items, styes etc

-User permission choice.
*Set permissions assigned to each user. (Not just click add Mod way) EG only make an admin disconnect and not ban.
*Limit users to where they can go.

-Towns/villages/places
* Make more and better villages.
* Re-write older areas and brighten them up a bit.
* Add more battle areans.
* Re-write the play owned houses into the server. (Re-make the project)
* Re-add the bank in lumbridge. (No idea where i got this idea from) &lt;_&lt;
* Mod meeting castle.
* Admin ONLY castle (Bar, smithing, free cash, amor, arena, private room)
* Hotel where only users who have paid can enter.
* Betting areana (Where you bet on a horse in a race and win cash. (Random winnings)
* The future center (Adds a town with the year 2006 style houses) (Possibilite)
* Adding the feature to rob bank. (A script that will randomly give you cash you could get caught if you do you lose all your bank/inventory items)
* Strip club (You know you want this added)

Other
 
* Customize the report abuse. (Make it private message an Admin*
* On login show latest server news + staff + warnings.


I know this may be up in the air and sounds noobish but I think if we all put our heads together and developers got there butts in a chatroom to discuss it, I think it would be a great project I have only found out about morparscape like last week but I have been dreaming about this for years. ^_^

Thankyou guys!

tell me what you think!</description>

              <p>No, I mean i just want someone whos good at coding to add all the projects into the wolf version of runescape. Because wolf’s project has alot of commands etc. I also need coders to code what they want and send it to the head guy who will add it to the version.</p>
<p>In noob language. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>lol, thankyou. But what I am really asking if anyone wants to be part I am acually kind of crap at coding. I can kind of code like I can read a bit of code and understand how it works as it does but I cannot sit down and read it.</p>
<p>So are there any takers? or anyone got a well modded version I could have because my has some glitches.<br>
I am basically asking for someone to add user projects and add it to make a bigger one. It is alot of work but think of the possibilites.</p>
<p>Good work guys keep up the great mods!</p>
