[ul][li]full pking with levels[/li]
[li]bh 80% done[/li]
[li]shops 65% done, using my shop handler of course.[/li]
[li]full npc update, attack, combat, and movement[/li]
[li]full drops[/li]
[li]trading is at 40%.. fixing the decline buttons and so it shows the amount of items and who ur trading with.[/li]
[li]membership-35%[/li]
[li]working interfaces with actionbuttons-70%[/li]
[li]full noted items, banking and noted changes to reg items when banked[/li]
[li]full specials and veng, fixed darkbow special and attack mode.[/li]
[li]added all the custom commands.. such as ipban, banuser,mute, kick etc...[/li]
[li]attack, str, def, hp, pray, range, mage, smithing, mining, wcing, and herblore work.[/li]
[li]fixed report abuse system, the report sends it to a file named reports.txt- a box pops up on your computer when there is a new report.[/li][/ul]


so far thats all i got.

-EDIT-

bh- removing pk lvls and adding lvl 138 wild so every can attack, fixed the target system so when it gives u a target the other player receives u, and when they leave it turns it to none. also fixing the skulls for it to give u the certain 1 for a certain amount of kills.

-credits-

pali- for base.
and other ppl for support.
