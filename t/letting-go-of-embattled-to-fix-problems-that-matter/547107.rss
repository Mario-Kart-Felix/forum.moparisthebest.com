    <description>Hey guys,
Some of you may or may not be familiar with a private server called Embattled which has been in development. It&#39;s a project I put countless hours and effort into, and it means a lot to me. But over the course of the last 6 months, I&#39;ve found a more important path in life, and that is fixing the countless issues that are affecting the world. 

I recently started a blog documenting the journey in which I will be taking to achieve this goals, and exactly how I will be making an impact is explained in the blog. If you guys would be kind enough to give it a read and post some feedback it would be greatly appreciated.

All feedback is appreciated.

Thank you.</description>
