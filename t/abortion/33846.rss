    <title>Abortion</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/abortion/33846</link>
    <description>Personally, I think it is completely wrong to have an abortion on an unborn child. Think about this carefully. You are taking away a life when you do it.

You are removing any chances that person had to be great. They might grow up and help the world one day. Be a doctor, a firefighters, save lives.

If a woman aborts her child, she is killing it. She chooses to take away someone&#39;s life. No one has that right. The child is not &quot;hers.&quot; You can&#39;t own a life.

Post your thoughts.</description>

<p><img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Yeah, there are a million different reasons that Abortion should be a right and should not be decided by the gov’t if you can abort the baby or not. Put yourselves in another person’s shoes. If any of you people who don’t believe in abortion, say if you were a woman, and you got raped or even had sex consensually, and became pregnant. What would you do?</p>
<p>Say your parents were busy and you didn’t want to put them into a foster home, and you didn’t want to lose a year of school because of being pregnant. If you were a teenager too, what would you do? Would you keep the baby and not have a future and probably have the kid live on the streets? or Would you do yourself and the baby a favor and just abort it?</p>

<p>Rape<br>
Condom Split<br>
Un-planned Pregnancies<br>
Teenage Pregnancies</p>
<p>I have no problem with abortion, but then again, I live in the UK, where abortion is almost a right to all women.</p>

<p>Your argument is retarded. In that case, maybe we should all go fuck each other and hope for an intelligent being to be born? because if we don’t have lots of sex then were cutting of the chance of an intelligent being to be born.</p>

              <p>This issue mainly exists in the US. Not so much of a problem in canada, or europe, same with most other non-puritanical countries. So here is my take on it.</p>
<p>Woman gets raped by … a rapist. Gets pregnant. Should she be able to abort it? Yes.</p>
<p>Father has sex with daughter, dauter is pregnant. Should she be able to abort it? Yes.</p>
<p>Those 2 arguments against abortion are deciding the laws. Whether or not you agree with abortion, the right to chose should ALWAYS go to the person who is pregnant. No matter what. You know why? Cause we’re Americans, and we’re supposed to be free and we’re supposed to be able to choose what happens to us. If someone goes against that, they are unpatriotic. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
