              <p>I support abortion, but just for poor people. People who can afford to keep the baby, whether they got raped or whatever, should. If you’re too poor, fuck it, that’s life; death. Abortion should be free. Like condums are given out.</p>

<p>I support, because its your child, you can do what you want. I think after 5 months, (usually face,legs,hands, bones developed), it should be 100% illegal.</p>

              <p>Yeah I support it. But only for the first 3 months, cause after that, then it actually goes from a small teeny thing to an actual baby with bones, and a face, and so on. Then I don’t agree with it.</p>
<p>I think the law in the most states are that you can get an abortion up to 3 months of pregnancy, but after that you can’t. Whereas other states state it’s illegal.</p>
<p>Here’s my view on abortion. A lot of teenagers have sex <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> and sometimes the woman gets pregnant, and when she does, her life is over after that unless she gets an abortion UNLESS she adopts the child, has her parents take care of the baby, or aborts it/rolls down the stairs. The guy probably won’t do anything about it, so he will get fucked cause he will have to pay child support on that kid for the next 18 years. Child support is 1/3 of the guys salary not including taxes. So if you’re a guy, and you screw around, get some girl pregnant, and leave or don’t marry her or whatever, then you’re screwed for a good part of your life.</p>
<p>Also, say I was a girl, and I was raped (ya ya haha) and I was pregnant, there is no way that I would bring that child into the world. No fuckin way. So that’s another reason people want to keep abortion and make it legal in all states.</p>
<p>The church doesn’t want you to have abortions, that’s a sin.<br>
The church doesn’t want you to wear a condom, that’s a sin.<br>
The church wants you to have another child so that you give more money to the collection plate, if you don’t, that’s a sin.</p>
<p>And that’s the bottom line. For some reason the southern states still have not acknowledged that we had a separation of church and state a long time ago. The souther states is the majority that wants to ban abortion.</p>
