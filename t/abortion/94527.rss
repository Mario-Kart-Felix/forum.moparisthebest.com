    <title>Abortion</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/abortion/94527</link>
    <description>So i heard this was a hot topic to discuss, i even asked my mum what her views on it were and she said that its like killing a human being if you get an abortion...
Utter crap i said.
The people who are against abortion [b]must[/b] be against sex then, because everytime a man ejaculates it releases millions of sperm cells.... which are usually killed in the condom!
So they must be against:
Sex,
Condoms,
abortion.

So people are worried about killing one small life form, when nearly all people are killing small life forms.. in the condom, i mean even when you walk about in ure carpet there are tiny life forms that you are killing by stepping on them....


So i ask your views on abortion....</description>

              <p>Ehh… There’s huge difference between a human being and sperm, don’t you think? A human being can live for long, sperm cell for 10 seconds. If you’d want to be a good person and not to kill anything or anyone then you couldn’t live since you eat, you skill, you walk, you kill ants. Who cares if ants die, the important thing is that humans survive. Every race cares for their own good. frank_ and Dawn you freaking racists lol.</p>
