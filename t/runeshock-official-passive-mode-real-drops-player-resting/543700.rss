[spoiler=Updates/Information Logs]X-logging whether against player or NPC will not sever your connection during combat. If you have passive mode disabled and EX-log, you will log on with passive mode still disabled. If you clicked the log-out button while passive mode is disabled, passive mode will be re-enabled by successful log out. Passive mode, and X-logging have been put into the complete section. Disabling passive mode gives you a white skull, and opens up an interface with, hp, prayer, energy, and a skull which you will not lose any items upon death. Attacking players will make that skull turn red and you will lose your items upon death. 

Passive mode has been adjusted only for wilderness use, you will not be able to fight in city&#39;s no longer. It was a tough decision, but it seems it&#39;s better not to eliminate the wilderness. To keep our wilderness much more player killing civilized. You may activate/disable passive mode out of the wilderness. You will not be able to switch through passive mode while in the wilderness, so if you&#39;re just there to watch you will be in peace mode while in the wilderness, or if you just want to fight wilderness monsters, or train agility. Without being a threat to anyone, or being threatened by anyone. 

On another note, stair cases and ladders are nearly 100 percent. Having some coordination errors, with player location when climbing ladders or staircases. Some offsets also need some fixing.

I have started up this project again, seemed to have some time now. Slow time at work, I have been putting 51+ hours a week. So, I will do my best to keep you all updated.
