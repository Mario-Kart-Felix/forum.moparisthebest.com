    <title>Proxy Server and Private Servers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/proxy-server-and-private-servers/110484</link>
    <description>I am at boarding school and the boarders here use proxy settings to connect to the internet i.e Tools -&gt; Internet Options... -&gt; Connection Settings -&gt; LAN Settings -&gt; Use a proxy server for your LAN... -&gt; Address = 10.1.1.3/Port = 8080. And I am having problems connecting to any servers, I am not sure if this is because of these settings or what. So could someone please tell me if it is a problem with these proxy settings or something else and if there are any obvious solutions.</description>
