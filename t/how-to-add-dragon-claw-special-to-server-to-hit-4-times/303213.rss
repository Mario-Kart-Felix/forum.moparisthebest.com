<p>search “specamount” in client.java and find the item id for a dds. copy and paste everything it says, but change the item id to your dclaws id and change spec amount to 50 instead of 25. then search the dds id again and copy and paste that and change it again to the dclaw code. Also change the hit amount from “2” to “4” and then compile it. it will have dds gfx, but it should still work.</p>
