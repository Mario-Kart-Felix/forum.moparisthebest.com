    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-port-forwarded-and-mopar-still-says-my-server-is-offline/363785</link>
    <description>I set up a no-ip.
i port forwarded and canyouseeme.org says my port is open.
and i downloaded the port checker from portforward.com and that says my port is open.
But then i went to register my server onto the moparscape server list and it said its not online.
My source is running and it says my server is online on the cmd box.
Whats wrong?</description>
