    <description>Well i recently started to code a 525, and i&#39;m confused obviously thats why i&#39;m posting here and i was wondering if someone can help me figure out how to change the teleport coordinates, and make a list of teles when i click on a teleport ex: when i click on varrock tele it says monster tele instead of varrock and it has a list in the chatbox saying like
rock crabs
tzharr 
etc...
