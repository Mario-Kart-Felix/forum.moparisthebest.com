        <p>I need some help telling my parents about my true religious beliefs.<br>
Story time: I was born and raised a Christian, however around the age of 13, I started to question my beliefs and a few weeks later claimed to be an Atheist. I changed my religious beliefs (on facebook) to Atheist, and my family members saw, whom then reported the sudden change to my parents. My parents called me into their room and a baww-fest commenced, and then they started making me go to church with them every Sunday, and made me have weekly talks with their pastor and I had to write down why I was questioning my beliefs. It was honestly hard to explain, so what I wrote down didn’t seem convincing to them. My pastor then went on to preach to me from his bible saying quotes from it and saying how evolution was false, etc. I also had to have daily conferences with my parents about my beliefs (an hour each day), but really all they did was tell me stories about what’s going to happen if I don’t believe in Christianity (they used the good ol’ scare tactics). They also, along with multiple other families they’re friends with, bought me a giant bag full of books on why Christianity is the way to go, and why evolution is wrong. One cold day in December, my mom angrily called for me to come into the computer room where she was sitting. She wanted to know where I started to get these ideas that made me question my faith in Christianity, and so off the top of my head, I said science class at school (8th grade at the time), however looking back on it, it really wasn’t the school’s fault, because I questioned my faith on my own time, not because of school. Anyways, she proceeded to write a very angry e-mail to the school saying how they shouldn’t be teaching evolution (even though they hardly even touched on it at all, just said the word once) because it’s causing me to question my faith and all this other stuff. Then a few weeks later my principal had a meeting with me saying that he’s sorry what was in the textbooks caused me to question my faith, and some more awkward talk happened that I can’t remember (he was actually pretty calm about all this like it’s happened before), then I went back to class. Eventually, after a couple weeks of these stressful events and daily conferences with my parents and weekly conferences with my pastor, I just gave in and claimed to magically be a Christian again, and all went back to normal. Although a couple months later, a couple weeks after I got confirmed, I secretly took my place (religiously) as an Agnostic. Over time I looked into other religions and philosophies like Buddhism and Taoism, and as of late, I’ve been really liking the ideas of Taoism and would like to look more into it.<br>
So my question to you is, how can I come out to my VERY Christian parents that I don’t share the same religious beliefs as them, but without getting pressured and scared into believing in their religion like they did last time?</p>

        <p>I’d just come right out and tell them.  They can’t really force you to believe in something.</p>
<p>Religion is stupid tbh.  I’m Christian, but 90% of the time I feel as if I should be atheist because I do not believe all the shit that is in Christianity, or any religion for that matter.</p>

        <p>Think of how they would respond and be ready to counter it.  That’s what you should do in any situation.</p>

If you watch the video (yeah it’s long) there is more evidence of the universe being nothing to something without a cause or a reason, than there is evidence a God. It shows molecules in a cup of coffee disappearing then reappearing, quite literally, then it goes on to describe the laws of the universe quite deeply (gravity, time and space) and how these laws apply to the universe and such.</p>
<p>Lastly it explains that it is quite plausible that the universe can just appear as a singularity where all the matter is insanely small and insanely dense and then “The Big Bang” happens .</p>
<p>Note that I said <span class="bbcode-i">more evidence</span> and not <span class="bbcode-i">absolute evidence</span>. Also did you know, in the 1300’s scientists and astrologists were given execution for questioning the existence of God. Then 400 years later it turns out the scientists were right (it was about the Earth going around the Sun and not vice versa).</p>
<p>So yeah, not nice people really considering they’re supposed to be the good guys. Does the religion get changed every time they realise they were wrong? Because Christians no longer kill people, thank God.</p>

I need some help telling my parents about my true religious beliefs.<br>
Story time: I was born and raised a Christian, however around the age of 13, I started to question my beliefs and a few weeks later claimed to be an Atheist. I changed my religious beliefs (on facebook) to Atheist, and my family members saw, whom then reported the sudden change to my parents. My parents called me into their room and a baww-fest commenced, and then they started making me go to church with them every Sunday, and made me have weekly talks with their pastor and I had to write down why I was questioning my beliefs. It was honestly hard to explain, so what I wrote down didn’t seem convincing to them. My pastor then went on to preach to me from his bible saying quotes from it and saying how evolution was false, etc. I also had to have daily conferences with my parents about my beliefs (an hour each day), but really all they did was tell me stories about what’s going to happen if I don’t believe in Christianity (they used the good ol’ scare tactics). They also, along with multiple other families they’re friends with, bought me a giant bag full of books on why Christianity is the way to go, and why evolution is wrong. One cold day in December, my mom angrily called for me to come into the computer room where she was sitting. She wanted to know where I started to get these ideas that made me question my faith in Christianity, and so off the top of my head, I said science class at school (8th grade at the time), however looking back on it, it really wasn’t the school’s fault, because I questioned my faith on my own time, not because of school. Anyways, she proceeded to write a very angry e-mail to the school saying how they shouldn’t be teaching evolution (even though they hardly even touched on it at all, just said the word once) because it’s causing me to question my faith and all this other stuff. Then a few weeks later my principal had a meeting with me saying that he’s sorry what was in the textbooks caused me to question my faith, and some more awkward talk happened that I can’t remember (he was actually pretty calm about all this like it’s happened before), then I went back to class. Eventually, after a couple weeks of these stressful events and daily conferences with my parents and weekly conferences with my pastor, I just gave in and claimed to magically be a Christian again, and all went back to normal. Although a couple months later, a couple weeks after I got confirmed, I secretly took my place (religiously) as an Agnostic. Over time I looked into other religions and philosophies like Buddhism and Taoism, and as of late, I’ve been really liking the ideas of Taoism and would like to look more into it.<br>
So my question to you is, how can I come out to my VERY Christian parents that I don’t share the same religious beliefs as them, but without getting pressured and scared into believing in their religion like they did last time?<br>
[/quote]<br>
And what are your reasons for you to question your faith?[/quote]<br>
Well, it’s a bit hard to explain, although it’s mainly because I just started to think something just wasn’t right. Something wasn’t clicking between me and Christianity, and I just couldn’t take it seriously anymore and just thought of it all to be make believe. And on my free time I did read about evolution.</p>
<p>[quote=“vManlyMan, post:5, topic:422257”]Think of how they would respond and be ready to counter it.  That’s what you should do in any situation.</p>
<p>And imo, religion is stupid and the world would be better off without it.  I can’t think of anything good that has come out of religion, only wars.[/quote]<br>
Well, the reason I didn’t want to tell them back when I was 13, was because of that, and I’ve always been really paranoid so I was afraid that they’d sneak into my room at night and kill me because I was unholy, or they’d (physically) torture me into believing again, so yeah… &gt;.&gt;</p>
<p>[quote=“The Outsider, post:6, topic:422257”]Your parents probably won’t accept it so either keep it to yourself and move on when you’re older or put your foot down and rebel.</p>

<p>yes from my sig u can see i believe in a God(b/c of all the evidence in life that suggested that a God does exist).

I remember that story =o And yeah I never really tried because I was just born into it all as though that was part of life and I only went to church and believed because they wanted me to</p>

Well, my parents basically reject anything that isn’t in the bible, or that my pastor says is false, so even hearing the word ‘evolution’ would likely cause them to get up and walk off<br>
My parents actually did become devastated telling me that they wanted me to be in heaven with them, not burning and screaming in torture down in hell, and I felt really bad for them so that’s also why I said I believed again. But I don’t want to hurt them and grow far apart, I just want them to respect that this is my life, and I can make my own decisions, and to let me believe in what I want to believe.</p>

        <p>Most here probably know I’m Christian and I’d be happy to answer and questions you may have about it if you want to. I completely agree with John, you can believe in science and have a religion without having to chose one over the other.</p>
<p>The main message in the bible (red letters) is to love everyone as He loved us, not that the universe was created in 7 days or Adam and Eve were nude when they met (hubba hubba).</p>
<p>That’s the main issue people see with religion, they can’t accept or don’t believe that the miracles could have happened. And to that I say - does it matter? As long as you love God and love people, you will go to heaven.</p>
<p>Personally I’m with you. I don’t know whether or not I believe the stories of Genesis or not, science can be pretty convincing at times <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> I believe one hundred percent God exists and Jesus walked this earth, and I believe that as long as I love my neighbor as myself and love God, I have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Sorry for getting sidetracked into the religion itself… anywho… I suggest you talk to them about it. Tell them about your doubts, questions, or fears. See what they reply? If they tell you to just ‘have faith’ I suggest go to someone else about it. They are still your parents at the moment so you need to be careful…</p>

<p>Hey guys, I’m going to bring this up with my parents sometime although I might have my cousin be there just in case, because she was in the same boat once, although she flat out told her parents how it was gonna be and didn’t do any meetings or conferences.<br>
SO with all that being said, I thank you all for your responses, and will dwell on what has been said here.<br>
Could a mod please lock this thread?</p>
