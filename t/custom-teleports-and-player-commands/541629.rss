    <title>Custom Teleports and Player Commands</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-teleports-and-player-commands/541629</link>
    <description>My home teleport which has a player right of 0 can be used by all players, normal, donor, admin and owner. By custom teleport ::npc1 also has a player right of 0, but can only be used by normal players, and cannot be used by donors, admins, or owner, I have a screenshot down below of my coding, can anyone help me?
Also I have only changed coding in commands.java, do I change the coding anywhere else?</description>

              <p>Your home teleport does not have any rights assigned to it. The <span class="bbcode-i">c.playerRights</span> segment is what defines the rights, change it to something like <span class="bbcode-i">c.playerRights &gt;= MINIMUM_RIGHTS_NEEDED</span>.</p>
