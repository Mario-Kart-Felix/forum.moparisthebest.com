    <title>Dark Souls Rsps - Development started</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dark-souls-rsps-development-started/545810</link>
    <description>I am creating a Dark Souls based rsps, This page will be where i post all progress. I will have pictures soon.

8/10/14 - Soul Level and Souls Counter added
[center]Today I finished making an npc be used to increase combat levels rather than killing individual npc&#39;s for xp.[/center]
[center]xp for kills has been completely tooken out.[/center]
[center]skills renamed:[center]
[center]vigor - hp[/center]
[center]vitality - def[/center
[center]intelligence - mage[/center]
[center]faith - prayer[/center]
[center]dexterity - atk[/center]
[center]str and range kept their original skill names[/center]

[center]although the combat leveling is changed there is still normal xp gaining for leveling up for skillers[/center]

max soul level is 678
there will be all new bosses that resemble dark souls based bosses
and new weapons and Armour that also resemble dark souls

tomorrow i plan to add life gems and estus flask but im not sure how exactly to incorporate fishing and cooking into the game
since dark souls doesnt use fishing and cooking. Ill think about that over the night.

pm me if you would like to join in on the project.
any questions opinions or thoughts leave below please! thanks hopefully yall like the idea once im finished.</description>

              <p>I’m aware the packet exists. if I understand right all it does is load smaller regions on different coordinates. why would you use it when the entire world is an instance? you still have to put a flag on the player saying they’re in an instance and make player/NPC/item updating obey the flag, which isn’t much different than the method I described other than being more of a hassle.</p>
<p>I know it’s not standard which is why I called it a trick. you could even achieve the same thing by keeping the players on the same floors but editing NPC/item updating so they are specific to players and not global, but I don’t see any real payoffs of doing this and I was really just expanding on the method Limits mentioned.</p>
<p>if you could enlighten me on a good reason other than jagex does it for small region instances…</p>

<p>if you’re seriously considering it you should create a separate set of NPCs that can show on all instances (traders, etc) and modify their updating function so they can also show across all instances</p>
<p>and then create “areas” with their own bundle of NPCs and items that spawn on an as-needed basis</p>
<p>i.e. if you have 100 players on the server, you should not be spawning 100 goblins for each of them the moment they log in, only when the player is in the area that the goblin exists (and you should delete them when the player leaves)[/quote]</p>
<p>the client has a packet for this, you can construct map regions for a specific player using a tile palette, the way you have described is the wrong way to do this</p>

<p>ahh okay thats true. Ima work on single player and story line first then go through and do multiplayer and multiple test and such for it.</p>
<p>[quote=“Death Style, post:38, topic:545810”]forgot you can make players appear as NPCs… so here’s a better way</p>
<p>edit player updating to show players on other floors when (your_floor % 4 == their_floor % 4)<br>
edit the appearance block so other players always appear as a ghost NPC<br>
(or wearing full ghostly robes)</p>
<p>for PVP just ignore the ghost overwrite when (your_floor == their_floor)</p>
<p>the real challenge is just making unique instances for every player, since each player will need a copy of the NPCs/items on their floors[/quote]</p>
<p>You seem very interested in the multiplayer portion of the game. Message me if you want to help me once I get to this point in development. Also why is it that npc’s dont spawn on height levels 1,2, and 3?</p>
<p>I finally just started the tutorial for new combat system and I am adding a book that tells a story line and such so the player can get a new feel for the game with a nice dialogue.</p>

show other players as ghosts when you’re not in pvp and spawn one of those blood stain tiles when they die<br>

<p>most of the server side is done like the combat system is completely different now . Npcs have a set atk that they do to the player unless the player has armour on then the damage goes down. Estus flask is in game now and working as well as humanity and life gems. And now theres a new feature where if you click f1 then you do a block emote and the player has about a 3 second window that he recieves no damage then f2 does the same but a dodge emote and has about 1.5-2 second window to recieve no damage and the f1 and f2 keys are controlled by the players energy or stamina im still working on grtting the stamina to be able to get leveled up but i domt know if thats gunna be able to work or not. And i added classes when starting out already. Jusy need to make the classes add skill lvls. And i need to change a few lvl requirements. I tthink ima make the game based with rs npcs first then once i figure out if its worth the time i will start maming dark souls npc’s and items.</p>

</aside>
<p>Click F1? what? And i’d suggest mapping that to a different key, some users, like myself dont have direct access to the F- keys.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Well what other key could they use besides F1? maybe tab key? and the “`” key under ESC? thanks for the comment. But yea players can now dodge attacks using F1 or F2 keys. Like in dark souls how you can use your shield to block attacks. But their stamina doesn’t restore as quick if its lower than 25 so they cant just keep clicking the F1 key and they have to wait a few seconds like between 2-4 seconds to do the dodge attack again. Also maybe for you not being able to access your F1 key, you could download Sharpkeys it makes different keys act as another key. like for my laptop im using right now both my shift keys dont work so i set it up to where the caps lock button acts as a shift key instead.[/quote]<br>
The problem is, on my keyboard (which is an Apple keyboard), the F- key’s are primarily used for: brightness control, dashboard, and some organization thing. To use the F- keys, I have to hold the “fn” button on my keyboard and then press an F- key.</p>
<p>This might be difficult to do but, is it possible to tell the client that during combat, the arrow keys are used for blocking and stuff only, not for camera control?</p>
