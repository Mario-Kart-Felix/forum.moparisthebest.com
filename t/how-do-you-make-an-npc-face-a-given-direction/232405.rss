    <title>How do you make an npc face a given direction?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-make-an-npc-face-a-given-direction/232405</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, now i have been researching for weeks now on how to make an NPC face a direction other than south, i have read pages after pages of questions on this and still there is no answer. I have tested about 50 different server sources and they all have there NPC&#39;s facing south! Obviously it is possible to make an NPC face a given direction, but how? I think it is time that someone with a lot of experience comes on this page and solves this problem for good, thanks for reading and i hope to get some good feedback.</description>
