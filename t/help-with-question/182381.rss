    <description>I am trieng to figure out, whats the proper code for a question thing? I cant really explain it, but I am looking for were you start, it will ask you a question. Example::

[b] Do you have exp with other mopar servers [/b]  [Question]

Yes[Answer one]
No[A2]
Hell ya[A3]

..

Also, how would i make them teleport you to certain places like
YES = straight to regular spawn
NO = TUTORIAL spawn
HELL YA = super hard dunguen with 1 hp :P
