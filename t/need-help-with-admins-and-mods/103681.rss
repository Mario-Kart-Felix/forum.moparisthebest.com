    <description>ok this means

//start of moderator/admin list, 1 = mod, 2 = staff, 3 = admin

does the 3 mean like owner or co- owner 
and 2 means regular admin and 1 means a mod right

well im the owner of my server and i have 2 friends who are co-owners i was just wondering that when i logged on before it would show the owner commands and now it doesnt but when i go on one of my friends it doesnt show the owner commands which it should....so should i change them both to 2=staff or what how do i fix this?</description>

<p>well 3 is owner 2 is admin 1 is mod 0 is normal player… and id advise you be the only owner… making them admin would be the smartest part and alsoyou may have done somthing wrong to cause it to do that</p>
