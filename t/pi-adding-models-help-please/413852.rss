    <description>I am trying to put models in my PI server, here is my progress, help with my problems if you can,

Ok, with help I got my ints to have one error, and that constits of my &quot;case&quot; being an orphan.. lol but im serious thats the error, its somthing to do with brackets.. here are my ints:
[code=java]		        case 13665:
                itemDef.actions = new String[5];                                                
                itemDef.actions[1] = &quot;Wield&quot;;
                itemDef.anIntArray156 = new int[2];
                itemDef.anIntArray160 = new int[2];
                itemDef.anIntArray156[0] = 43072;
                itemDef.anIntArray160[0] = 925;
                itemDef.anIntArray156[1] = 4550;
                itemDef.anIntArray160[1] = 925;
                itemDef.anInt174 = 14104;
                itemDef.modelZoom = 1330;
                itemDef.modelRotation1 = 310;
                itemDef.modelRotation2 = 1800;
                itemDef.modelOffset1 = 0;
                itemDef.modelOffset2 = 1;
                itemDef.anInt165 = 14105;
                itemDef.anInt200 = 14105;
                itemDef.anInt164 = 14106;
                itemDef.anInt188 = 14106;
                itemDef.aBoolean176 = false;
                itemDef.name = &quot;Dragon platebody&quot;;
                itemDef.description = &quot;Provides excellent protection&quot;.getBytes();
                break;
[/code]
Ok, whats wrong with case at the top? compiler says its an orphan, what to do?

The last problem, is that I don&#39;t know where to put my models, I have no Raw or models folder! so what do i do there? If you can help on any of these please do..</description>
