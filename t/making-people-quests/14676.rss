              <p>if you are still doing this then can i have a quest:</p>
<p>storyline:<br>
talk to king and ask about a quest and he tells you he needs two kbds (or other monster) killed but you need a special weapon (silver light) to kill them but the king doesnt have the silver light and he tells you that another person knows how to get it and the guy(one of the kings army) tells you that you have to go to the fat old dwarf(cant remember his name) and get him to make you a silverlight handle but he cant make the actual sword so he tells you to talk to another person about the sword and that guy will make u the sword part and then u have to put them together and then kill the monsters the place where the caves are is where u would normally goto get the firecape and you have to search for the kbds(to get there talk to the king) after killing the monsters you get 50k and get to keep the silverlight and/or you get dragon sheild<br>
theme:old and a fighting one</p>
