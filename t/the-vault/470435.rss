I encourage you to come and join our new community. We offer forums to discuss the game and to just relax and talk in the lounge. We are currently giving away 4 VIP spots to the next 4 members of our forum. We also offer a marketplace section for both games. We have mature and active staff. We take the forums seriously and don&#39;t put up with LQ posters and immature members. We have rules that you must follow. I encourage you to join us at
