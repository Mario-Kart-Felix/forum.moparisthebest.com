its really good, but to get the point across you need a bigger media (as in a header or something instead of a sig) or bigger font. also, wouldnt it make more sense if “universe” was in a font different from the rest of the text? because theoretically, you would have written “sky” first. anyway, i also see what eh pretty easy said. the font you used looks like something that would be used for a title of a disney movie. and, because it is so straight and flat, it appears very…limited, which kind of contradicts your theme here. try something more curvy and blurry. one final idea: i think it would look awesome if the blonde anime dude (idk if i should recognize him for somewhere or not…) were in color and the background was in grayscale and maybe blurred. could be better, but its a great sig, one of the better things i’ve seen on mitb.<br>

              <p>I think the signature looks better with the Sky in it. But make the strikethrough more defined, it’s hard to see it currently. It definitely looks better with color, but that’s just a bit too random. You need to focus in more on a specific area of the color palette. A peach/purple grad would do nicely, leaving Edward in full color. You could have something coming off of his hands. Make it look like he is soaring. The color is really what will improve this signature, it will make the intricate little details in the background pop. And overall will unify the signature. Right now the signature without color flows better, but with a more neutral palette of colors it should look fine. Just make sure the peach is closer to the center, and the purple is around the outsides. Like a Radial Gradient. The ‘The’ in the beginning should be minuscule, it shouldn’t show much at all. And the block of text should be in the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>You need to decide on some way to make Edward blend more, because in the color signature, it looks like he was pasted on there. I see you made a duplicate of him, and turned down the opacity on it, but you might could make another duplicate, and place it underneath the main render, and possible blur it. Like a Motion Blur to the North East. The signature might look better if the color affected Edward, making it look more like he’s in the signature, instead being placed on it.</p>
<p>Other than that I can’t think of anything that you can improve it on. Maybe after you’ve made the changed there might be something else you can do with it.</p>
<p>5/10.</p>
