    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-trouble/436164</link>
    <description>Hey!, im quite new to rsps coding, i got quite good at 317&#39;s as you basically need no webclients to make with a 317 server, so i thought it was time to go further so i downloaded the Insidiax Source &#39;602&#39; , to see how i do, basically. i like my servers to have webclients because my friends have a thing about downloading and i like to have teams and such to test out my coding skills once i fiddle around with customs and stuff.

Anyway to the point, i have tried many tutorials on making a webclients and none seem to have worked. iknow im doing something wrong, can anybody help me on my webclient problems i have got close to making webclients even to the point the webclient is up but only works for me.

Thanks for reading, hope you can help me out.</description>

              <p>First off, InsidiaX is not a 602 revision based server, it is a 317 loading a 602 cache. Second off, creating a client should be basically the same as before as long as the client isn’t different than your past one (Renamed, Refactored or even Non).</p>
