</aside>
<p>Pking servers are stupid, if it is skilling/pk that is better. The skillers make the items for the pkers to use. Pots, armour, food, ect… If you just make pk that’s boring. You come across the same people everytime. If it is skilling/pk it is awesome, because you have the choice, skill or pk and either way you make good cash and friends in the process.</p>
<p>The thing about private servers that make a lot of them popular, is the fact that they have a good environment, like having a good staff team, the coder takes care of glitches, the rules are known but not in-forced strictly and the people are having a good time and making friends in the process. I have meet a lot of my RSPS friends off of 1 server, I stayed with it a long time just because it was fun, it was an AllStar base which is crappy laggy and glitchy, but I stayed because everyone knew eachother and it was flat out fun to be with people and log on and see a familiar face, that is why I avoid popular servers for one, because they lose their touch along the way.</p>
<p>Example of a crappy server. I was IP-Banned from a server for saying the owners name too many times… He then proceeded to call me a ‘fucking idiot’. That is when Ryan’s handy SYI comes in handy. That guy was the owner and had too many people on his source for him to even get to know anyone, he treated me like scum. That is what Jagex is doing, and that is why they are losing so many customers.</p>
