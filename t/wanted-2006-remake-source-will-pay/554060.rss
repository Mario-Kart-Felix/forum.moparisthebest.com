    <title>WANTED: 2006 remake source, will pay! :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wanted-2006-remake-source-will-pay/554060</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

So I&#39;m looking for a 2006 remake source (2006scape, OldRS, etc) with complete skills, relatively complete areas and quests if possible. Something that can be played immediately, ideally a project like OldRS that was given up on by developers but is fully functional and playable. I want this for private gaming with my friends, just to have a copy of the RS I used to love and can play whenever I want. I am willing to pay for this source, so please respond or PM me and we can discuss it :)

Thanks!</description>
