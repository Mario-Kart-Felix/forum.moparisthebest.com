Hello MoparScape,

This is the iHaxx Server Developers thread here at MoparScape. Let me start by explaining a little bit about the website + server itself, iHaxx started out in 2007 not long after i started coding in 2006, The project became quite big as it hit up 5,000 Registrations in the first 2 months of launching the server. In 2008 i decided to close the website due to issues that was occuring in my life. Now in August 2010 i started to develop iHaxx Server - Version 2 now this is where i want our website to gain users again.


Since august i&#39;ve developed a fresh highscores from scratch, i&#39;m re-writing out a message centre + black mark system ([url=http://m.ihaxx.net]this can be previewed by going here[/url]) to work with my new template and i&#39;m also looking to make the whole server SQL Handled From drops to shops.
