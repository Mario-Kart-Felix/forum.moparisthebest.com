    <title>How Do I find the ip to put in when i go to no-ip.com</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-find-the-ip-to-put-in-when-i-go-to-no-ip-com/48342</link>
    <description>So this is what i&#39;ve done so far, Ive made an account and all and set the no-ip as shascape.no-ip.info.  But where do I find the IP to set it to, Iv&#39;e already tried the Ip in the left hand corner of screen but i can&#39;t login to my server, when i type the ip as 127.0.0.1 and login my server as shascape.no-ip.info i can get in but no-one else can.

Help please

PS.  I don&#39;t know if i need to download anything or not, but i tried to download no-ip and it has an error saying it doesnt recognize the file type and all, even though i have .rar so i cant get it downloaded.</description>

              <p>Well 127.0.0.1 will not work, because it is your Local IP, only you can enter it.<br>
For your real IP, when logged in to <a href="http://no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.org</a> look in the left upper corner,<br>
You should see something like this</p>
<p><code>Logged In As: *email adress*
Current IP: *your IP here* </code></p>
<p>The Ip after the Current IP is the one you need to have, unless you are running a hamachi server, then you need the IP wich is shown on top of the Hamachi screen.</p>
