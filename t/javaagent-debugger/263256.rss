    <description>Hi. After revisited [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,124319.msg1248389.html#msg1248389]this post[/url] from 2007, I was inspired to make something like what regecks had made.

What it does is it modifies each method and adds a call that passes the arguments from that method to [i]AnyHook.fired[/i], from where we can then process them and do whatever.

To set it up just follow [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,128629.msg1247978.html#msg1247978]this guide[/url] ;D (with the -javaagent tag pointing to build.jar of course).

Expect some massive lag when using this with runescape. Use the toggle button OR just filter out the undesired results to combat this. ALSO sometimes randomly it hits some exceptions about &#39;Illegal constant pool index&#39;, can anyone shed any light on this?

So, what do you think? Is their any tips you can give or standards I should be following?</description>

              <p>A bit pedantic but:<code>if(name.contains("java") || name.contains("sun")

		}</code> Should be startsWith(“java.”) and so on. Note the “.”. Include “javax.” as well. Also put it in a package so you don’t have to list all your classes.</p>
<p><code>if(args.length &lt;= 0) 
						continue;</code><br>
Probably incorrect. As the code stands it would create an array of length 0 which is correct. This way the action is fired for all methods rather just those with more than 0 arguments.</p>
<p><code>insert.append(fact.createInvoke(
								type, "valueOf",
										Type.getType("L" + type + ";"), 
								new Type[] { 
									args[i] 
							}, Constants.INVOKESTATIC));</code> I think bcel includes some routines to automatically box primitive types. I recommend you use those.</p>
<p>Otherwise the code looks okay at a cursory glance.</p>
<p>Check where you get ‘Illegal constant pool index’ errors. I suspect it is due to calling a method with a primitive type that you haven’t converted properly.</p>
