    <title>Decompiling class files within a jar</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/decompiling-class-files-within-a-jar/453366</link>
    <description>Today is the worst day of my project&#39;s development. I messed up my client and somehow messed up the backups. The only trace I have of an error free client is my client.jar. I understand there are many decompiling softwares; however, I&#39;ve tried a few and they put some kind of weird JVM code through the classes and it just makes it even worse. I&#39;ve even seen a program that actually changes some of the data within the classes. Does anyone know any type of software that will decompile class files 100% correctly without changing anything?</description>
