    <description>I myself hate any server 508 plus, and since there&#39;s such a huge difference between the revisions stated in the title, I think it would be great to separate them. A lot of people(like me) only have an interest in 1 revision, so it would probably organize the Runescape Emulation section a lot. I also don&#39;t really like opening a help thread to find it&#39;s some revision I know nothing about. There&#39;s probably more reasons, just can&#39;t think of them atm.

And since I don&#39;t think this requires another thread:

I seriously think there should be some format required to post in the Server Help section. It&#39;s so damn annoying seeing people asking questions and not even stating there base, having pics, pasting errors, or any other information that can help.

Edit2:

Haven&#39;t been seeing that enforced a whole lot, an actual layout would be awesome.</description>

<p>One of the things I see is quite successful on r-s is the split layout. Nevertheless, it’s difficult to pull off without it becoming very tacky and difficult to manage. What exactly do you suggest?</p>

<p>Not just the download section, everything. I don’t think deleting every single download is really needed anyways</p>
<p>Maybe we can make it so when they click “start thread” the layout is already typed for them.</p>

              <p>I myself hate any server 508 plus, and since there’s such a huge difference between the revisions stated in the title, I think it would be great to separate them. A lot of people(like me) only have an interest in 1 revision, so it would probably organize the Runescape Emulation section a lot. I also don’t really like opening a help thread to find it’s some revision I know nothing about. There’s probably more reasons, just can’t think of them atm.</p>
<p>And since I don’t think this requires another thread:</p>
<p>I seriously think there should be some format required to post in the Server Help section. It’s so damn annoying seeing people asking questions and not even stating there base, having pics, pasting errors, or any other information that can help.</p>

<p>Haven’t been seeing that enforced a whole lot, an actual layout would be awesome.</p>
