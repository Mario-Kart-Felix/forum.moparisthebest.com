    <description>(this is a rant) 
[code=java]
unsigned byte x;
signed byte y;

unsigned short v;
signed short w;
[/code]

It&#39;s getting annoying &lt;___&lt;
How do you guys deal with this? People suggest everywhere that you have to use the next data type in order to use the rest of the values but that just takes up twice the memory...
FYI: I&#39;m trying to re-write DCPU16 in Java and the best way I worked around it is this:
[code=java]public class Word {

	/**
	 * The amount of bits that this word has.
	 */
	private byte wordlength;
	
	/**
	 * The actual bits in this word.
	 * The bits are ordened in the standard format; right to left with the least significant to the right.
	 */
	private boolean[] bits;

	/**
	 * Constructor.
	 */
	public Word(byte wordlength, boolean[] bits) {
		if (wordlength == bits.length) {
			this.wordlength = wordlength;
			this.bits = bits;
		}
	}
	
	/**
	 * The value of this word (binary).
	 * The for loop is in reverse because of the way the bits are stored.
	 */
	public short getValue() {
		short inc = 1;
		short result = 0;
		for (int i = bits.length-1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
			if (bits[i]) {
				result += inc;
			}
			inc *= 2;
		}
		return result;
	}

}[/code]
(that class isn&#39;t finished yet)
Also the short [i]getValue[/i] isn&#39;t a solution since 16bit words reach up 65k+ but in Java shorts reach to positive 32k...
So how do you guys do it?</description>

<p>chances are you’re going to cast up to an integer to preform arithmetic; but as i said: why do you care about 2bytes? you realize that if you have allocated 10,000 ints on the heap rather than shorts, you’d only be using 20kb more memory, right? so unless you’re running on hardware with &lt; 1mb of ram (which isn’t even possible w/ the JVM), there’s no need to care. Yes, it does matter in networking, though - but this is avoided because you can easily shift the integral around to extract the hi/lo components and place them into the outgoing buffer.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I could write arithmetic in the Word class xD<br>
And I wanted to do this using only booleans, bytes and shorts because I really wanted a pure 16bit emulated CPU without using anything bigger than 16 bits.<br>
I’m going to continue doing this with the method I started (Word class) because I don’t care about the speed; I just want it to be purely 16bit and it has to function. Those are my 2 only goals xD</p>
<p>The reason to this thread was me raging and I wanted to know how you guys get around this ^^<br>
I think I understand why booleans eventually take up 32 bits and thanks for all the information guys[/quote]<br>
emulators… emulate… (meaning you could store it however the hell you want it as long as what is being emulated observes its environment correctly)</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Also OP, it’s something you’ll have to accept and deal with. As a suggestion, use a char array for memory since it’s considered an unsigned word length variable.</p>

<p>You should have no reason to cast to short; I’d fathom a guess that his warning was in regards to compiler errors complaining of “possible loss of precision” in that this is a narrowing conversion.<br>
A side-note: boolean is not defined as a single bit; additionally, short and byte (along with boolean in the HotSpot VM) are stored in the heap using 8- and 16-bits respectively, but on the stack they’re aligned to stack words and thus widened to 32-bits, their <span class="bbcode-i">computational type</span>.</p>

              <p>Well that sucks, doesn’t it?<br>

Therefore I restricted myself to using boolean (1bit), byte (8bits) and shorts (16bits).</p>
<p>But wow is this real? Then I still don’t get why he would add boolean, byte and short types if they end up taking the same memory as integers do &lt;___&lt;<br>
Oh well…Thanks for the info</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
I was aware of the ‘char’ being used for that but I read this first :<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">(The only exception is that Java does provide the ‘char’ type, which is a 2 byte representation of unicode, instead of the C ‘char’ type, which is 1 byte ASCII. Java’s ‘char’ also can be used as an unsigned short, i.e. it represents numbers from 0 up to 2^16. The only gotchas are, weird things will happen if you try to assign it to a short, and if you try to print it, you’ll get the unicode character it represents, instead of the integer value. If you need to print the value of a char, cast it to int first.)</span><br>

<p>So again, I didn’t like how it worked.<br>
On the other hand, if I refrain from ‘printing’ it and just use ‘char’ to replace ‘short’ then I shouldn’t have any problems but it just doesn’t feel like it’s the right way to do it.</p>

              <p>The only savings w.r.t. memory you would gain with unsigned integers are limited to the heap, as, like Fat Cookies mentioned, Java internally treats integral data types byte, short, and char on the operand stack as ints, i.e. by their <span class="bbcode-i">computational type</span>. See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.11.1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this section</a> in the JVM Specification.<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/CmFn" alt width="" height=""><br>
When using them on the stack they’ll be widened to 32-bits, the width of a single stack word, anyways, so why is it such a concern? Aren’t emulators focused on speed over memory usage?</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s important that you understand that your implementation of unsigned data-types (Word) not only wastes far more memory than using int but is also much slower. First, take a look at <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.3.4" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this excerpt</a> from the JVM Specification:</p>
<blockquote>Although the Java virtual machine defines a boolean type, it only provides very limited support for it. There are no Java virtual machine instructions solely dedicated to operations on boolean values. Instead, expressions in the Java programming language that operate on boolean values are compiled to use values of the Java virtual machine int data type.
<p>The Java virtual machine does directly support boolean arrays. Its <span class="bbcode-i">newarray</span> instruction (<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.newarray" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">§newarray</a>) enables creation of boolean arrays. Arrays of type boolean are accessed and modified using the byte array instructions <span class="bbcode-i">baload</span> and <span class="bbcode-i">bastore</span> (<span class="bbcode-i"><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.baload" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">§baload</a></span>, <span class="bbcode-i"><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.bastore" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">§bastore</a></span>).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=7pt]In Oracle’s Java virtual machine implementation, boolean arrays in the Java programming language are encoded as Java virtual machine byte arrays, using 8 bits per boolean element.[/size]</span></p>
<p>The Java virtual machine encodes boolean array components using 1 to represent true and 0 to represent false. Where Java programming language boolean values are mapped by compilers to values of Java virtual machine type int, the compilers must use the same encoding.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>boolean[] are stored as byte[] on the heap, meaning for storing the ‘bits’ of a 16-bit unsigned value, you’re actually using 128-bits.</li>
<li>boolean, while not integral, are mapped to ints on the stack as well, so each bit is taking up as much stack space as the corresponding int that would contain all of them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Back to my comment about speed, do you really believe this (pretending it even worked):</p>
<p><code>        public short getValue() {
                short inc = 1;
                short result = 0;
                for (int i = bits.length-1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
                        if (bits[i]) {
                                result += inc;
                        }
                        inc *= 2;
                }
                return result;
        }</code><br>
… is a reasonable alternative to this:</p>

How do you guys deal with this? People suggest everywhere that you have to use the next data type in order to use the rest of the values but that just takes up twice the memory…<br>
FYI: I’m trying to re-write DCPU16 in Java and the best way I worked around it is this:</p>
<p>[code=java]public class Word {</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * The amount of bits that this word has.

private byte wordlength;

/**
 * The actual bits in this word.
 * The bits are ordened in the standard format; right to left with the least significant to the right.
 */
private boolean[] bits;

/**
 * Constructor.
 */
public Word(byte wordlength, boolean[] bits) {
	if (wordlength == bits.length) {
		this.wordlength = wordlength;
		this.bits = bits;
	}
}

/**
 * The value of this word (binary).
 * The for loop is in reverse because of the way the bits are stored.
 */
public short getValue() {
	short inc = 1;
	short result = 0;
	for (int i = bits.length-1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {

			result += inc;
		}
		inc *= 2;
	}
	return result;
}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]<br>
(that class isn’t finished yet)<br>
Also the short <span class="bbcode-i">getValue</span> isn’t a solution since 16bit words reach up 65k+ but in Java shorts reach to positive 32k…<br>
So how do you guys do it?</p>
