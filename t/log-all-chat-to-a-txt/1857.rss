    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/log-all-chat-to-a-txt/1857</link>
    <description>i need a script that will log all the chat to a txt and have it named &lt;playerame&gt;.txt where playername is the name of your bot.
i need this so i can update the PlyrChat random. if i have a better idea of what people say i can add and remove some stuff from it. i need it to save it in the Aryan folder in a folder called logs or somthing like that.</description>
