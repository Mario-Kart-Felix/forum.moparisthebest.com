              <p>I used this to make a lot of things. A pass protected journal, an annoying thing that ran 1000 calcs on ur pc, a merchant helper, and a few other things. This was the second language I learned. Anyone who gets it, you can find it’s serial on serials.ws also, go through the tut. It’s really good.</p>
