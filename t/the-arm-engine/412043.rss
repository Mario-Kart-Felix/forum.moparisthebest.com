    <description>

[size=4]Well, I recently decided to develop a complete high end advanced 3D engine that can render in DirectX and OpenGL, ofcourse this won&#39;t be something to make in 1 2 and 3.[/size]

[size=4]I have 2 years time to complete this engine because of the fact that 2 years is what is left for me to go to DAE (Digital Arts and Entertainment). This engine will become very handy in the future.[/size]

[size=4]I will also probably assemble a team together for when the engine is completed, and make the next Call of Duty.[/size]

[size=4]This engine will be completely written in C++ and I will try to use as few libraries as possible.[/size]
[size=4]The main reason I&#39;m doing this project is because I want to turn into a C++ guru and the only way to do that is by doing a big project like this one and learning on the go. I know this technique works because I have done projects like this in the past to learn Flash, ofcourse this is on a totally different scale and will take A LOT of time. So atm, I&#39;m just doing a lot of research on C++, using the high end 3D API&#39;s, how other people wrote 3D engines,... To get a basic POV of what I will go trough.[/size]

[size=4]After that I&#39;ll start writing a basic 3D shitty graphical game, add more and more advanced functions to the shitty game, and evantually turn that game into an engine and start doing some serious work.[/size]

[size=4]All my progress will be documented within this topic and I will try to document as much as possible on how I went forward as this will help a lot of other people trying to do something similar.[/size]

[size=4]My english isn&#39;t perfect, I learned it mainly from watching movies and playing runescape when I was younger so excuse me for that but It&#39;s understandable.[/size]

[size=4]For those who want to know, this engine will be completely closed source and I will name it Arm Engine, Arm represents my mother country, Armenia. And Engine well, that just represents engine. In other words, Armenian Engine, but the official name will be Arm Engine. So that&#39;s that.[/size]

[size=4]Anyhow, we&#39;ve reached the end of this particular log, so see you soon.[/size]

I’m glad you finally came to the only right conclusion, and I’m hoping to see the actual engine in a few years time! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I’m sorry, but it won’t happen. Your expectations are too high for your desired time, especially if you’re only reading books and online tutorials. Maybe if you had a few years of experience, then went to college for game development, then practiced after you graduated and worked at a company where you were taught more stuff, sure, but as it stands now, no. If two years pass and you meet all of your goals, you can come visit me at the college I’ll be attending and brag to me for hours on end.</p>

[/quote]yeah um you’re probably going going to want to learn calculus and a good amount of linear algebra. i’m also looking forward to seeing your progress, assuming you won’t quit.[/quote]Well, I’m not planning to quit, and I will work on this as much as possible but I’m also going to go to a special programming highschool in about 2 days and they teach me C# and all kinds of other languages there, 6 hours software and 6 hours hardware each week combined with advanced math. And that for 2 years makes for approximately 600 hours software and 600 hours hardware, wich means that I’ll be busy. Also I’m making flash games and selling them as an income so that also keeps me busy. But I’ll try to make time everyday to work on the engine. Because noone is going to teach me C++/Graphics in the coming 2 years. Anyways I’m reading a book atm, C++ book, and I’m really learning it in-depth not just fast reading, and I’m doing additional research, I’m trying to master the language in order for this all to happen.</p>

<p>Mista, why don’t you actually start and prove us wrong? Judging by the many all nighters I’ve pulled with Taharok over the summer our engine is decent but not capable of anything yet. Once you get to the uvw mapping, terrain, youll be extremely worn out, and at the animation part you’re going to rip your hair out. Its not all lights and textures.[/quote]I will prove you wrong as soon as I finished learning advanced C++, after I see my C++ is good enough for starting to write the engine, I’ll learn how to use the DirectX APIs and so forth, however, getting to know advanced C++ might take me a month.</p>

The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude; without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.
