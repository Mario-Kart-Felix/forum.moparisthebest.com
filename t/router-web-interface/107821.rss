    <description>While following the port foward guide I came across this and was like how do you get to that??


It says quoted &quot; The first way is to log into your router&#39;s web inteface, and look at your router&#39;s status page. On that page you should see an entry for DNS Servers, or Name Servers. Write down the ip adresses of your Name Servers.

How do you get to your &quot;Router&#39;s Web Interface&quot;?</description>
