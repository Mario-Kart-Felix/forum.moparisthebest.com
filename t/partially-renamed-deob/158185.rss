    <title>Partially Renamed Deob</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/partially-renamed-deob/158185</link>
    <description>ok this is my shit, barely renamed deob..., i started this back in October, after 474 came out... I used quaters and sh!ft&#39;s updater outputs, as well as a lil poking around in the new client and the old 317 highly renamed deob... this is by far incomplete! I only used what was available with me, i think probably only 20-30 classes are identified but i didn&#39;t take the time to count... A Lot of the methods i renamed, were in classes we don&#39;t have names for yet, so i tried to save them from being lost in a class, hence the GroundIntArray class, and the CamY Class... i have also included the changelog, and the unrenamed deob of 474, i made this by editing the changelog then using mopar&#39;s Unrenamer, to bypass the subs of classes that are always there, in 474 the class37sub*sub*sub*... those are very annoying to deal with if u manually rename... If you don&#39;t like the names, change them, and reup... idc rly... I Will finish this eventually, but since 475 is out, i thought i would release it....
