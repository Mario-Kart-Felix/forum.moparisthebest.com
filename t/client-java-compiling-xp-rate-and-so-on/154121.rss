    <title>Client.java, Compiling, Xp rate and so on</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-java-compiling-xp-rate-and-so-on/154121</link>
    <description>First off, i got Runescape 3 (server-files), its like runescape 2 (by jagex) copy!

Ive got a Millenium Computer. Windows ME English edition

Ive tried to Compile it by doing following:

[b]
Open in Notepad , (File Says It cant be opened)
Open in Notepad+ , (Worksto open,  but file wont get saved)
[/b]

Using Compile.bat, it doesn&#39;t work either. (using C to compile and R to run, Right)

[u][b]Second off,[/b][/u]
Making quests, Make Quests ?
How to change the XP-RATE ?
and how to Change how much the MOBS will hit you ?
And Itemmaker , by command; ex.

::item 2012 , then the item (2012) plops up in your bag.
Cus it can be really messy with like 10 K commands in your client.java file.
Like, about, 1 command to make the items? and not 1 command for each item ?

THANKS AND PLEASE DONT REMOVE THIS!
MOVE IF ITS IN THE WRONG SECTION!</description>

              <p>By saying your compiler doesn’t work do you mean it says like 'jave is not an internal or external file or it says like You do not have JDK 0.5 or JDK 0.6. If this is the case then you have to change your compiler. Post back to tell me if  this si the problem, if so then i’ll walk you through changing your compiler.</p>
