    <description>!!PROJECT INSANITY!!
lets start off with saying that i&#39;m creating a &quot;f2p&quot; based server with &quot;member&quot; benefits such as being able to wield a members item like Dragon Claws...

 so anyways i was wondering if one of you guys could help me with making it so if you are a member and you go into the &quot;wildy&quot; and are wielding a members weapon, armour, and any other members items you would not be able to attack a non-member player.

to shorten things up ...

(this is some bullshit that makes so sense)
if member = true
check for members item in slots
if members item is found
then attack non-member player = false.</description>

i honestly don’t care if i get alot of players but i see where you’re coming from.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/ashton51">@ashton51</a><br>
i have done that already, i want to make it fair in the wilderness if you have an item that is members only then you cannot attack a player that does not have a members only item.</p>
