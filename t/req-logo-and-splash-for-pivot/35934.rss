    <title>[Req]Logo and Splash for Pivot</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-logo-and-splash-for-pivot/35934</link>
    <description>Hey; I&#39;m in need of a high-quality logo and splash screen for Pivot, and think that it would be better looking if I didn&#39;t make it lol.

The theme for the visual aspects of Pivot are going to be dark red and orange. I haven&#39;t finished thinking of a logo, but I think a crosshair-like thing would be cool. In the splash screen, I&#39;d like it to be 455x296 or so. I would like it to have the logo somewhere in there, at a pretty decent size. If you could animate it that would be a GIGANTIC thank you. The reason I thought that the crosshair idea would be good would be because you could animate it to spin a little and shrink a bit (as if zooming in) in the splash screen, which would go with the name &quot;Pivot&quot;. If you could include in the animation a glow effect that rises and then dims on the word Pivot that would be lovely. I would also REALLY love some text in the bottom left saying &quot;Please wait while Pivot loads...&quot; and I think an animated glow effect on this would be spectacular. Please also include a standard size icon also so I could integrate it.

Of course whoever does this will receive FULL credits for his/her work once Pivot is completed, and will not be forgotten in the credits file.


Sidenote -- 

Please do not put your name on the splash or logo. I want you to be recognized, but if it was done in this way, users might believe Pivot was made by you. ;) I don&#39;t want to put my name on it either, because more people might become involved in Pivot. However, when I make a credits file, you WILL be given FULL credits for the splash and logo.</description>

<p>I am very grateful that you guys are helping, but I think it would be perfect if you could use those suggestions.</p>
<p>Thanks! :D[/quote]<br>
