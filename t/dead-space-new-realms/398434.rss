Welcome to New Realms, your life doesn&#39;t have to be limited to earth!

New Realms is a village in space that lets people escape from earth and start a new life in space. Not all ends well in New Realms. As they start moving further and further out into space strange and gruesome deaths start happening, and no one knows why. As more people start dying the deaths pick up, soon most of the bodies weren&#39;t found. Then they broke loose. A huge swarm of Nechromorphs storm New Realms and kill just about everyone except for Blake Orr and a few people who escaped these horrible creatures. Your job is to keep the Necromorphs under control until a elite unit comes to your aid.

Hey guys! As you saw I&#39;m making a game of Dead Space. This isn&#39;t going to be like an ordinary Dead Space. It&#39;s going to be an 8bit side scroller. This will be my first attempt at anything other than a private server. I&#39;ll be using Game Maker from Yoyo games. I know this is a long shot and I&#39;m really in over my head, but I think I can make this work. 

I got the inspiration for this actually from a picture (posted below) and I thought it would be really cool to make this. I have a lot of expectations for this. I would like to make multiple minigames and other game modes.

[b][u]Game Modes[/u][/b]
I am planning on having at least 4 different modes: story mode, free play, glory mode, and expedition. Story mode would be the regular story of course. You would play through the story line and beat the game and unlock Free Play and Glory Mode. Free play would be you could choose any area you would wish to start at and work your way around. I&#39;m also hoping that I can make it so you can play as different characters that you meet up with throughout the story. Glory mode would be basically the hard version of the regular story, but wouldn&#39;t have any dialogs or anything that would stop you. So basically you would just run right on through the levels until the end. You would unlock the free play characters this way. Expedition would be unlocked after Glory Mode is complete. That would be playing from the elite units site of things. You would probably stay in a hip for the most part and kill the Necromorphs as you make your way to help New Realms. 

[b][u]Online[/u][/b]
I would like to make an online version of this game in multiple modes. This would include Free play and other minigame modes. I would also like to make a highscores type of thing.

[b][u]Minigames[/u][/b]
I would definatly have a Necromorphs blaster minigame. You would just have to run through blasting away and killing as many as you can before you die. I would also like to have PvP mode where you could fight each other. I might think up of some other minigames as I go along but for now thats all (at least for version 1). 

[b][u]What are you making this with?[/u][/b]
I will be making this with Game Maker and simple paint images.

[b][u]Would you need any help?[/u][/b]
If you would like to be a part of this I would most likely let you given you have a fairly good knowledge of Game Maker. I have only started on the images at the moment. 

[b][u]Media[/u][/b]

Image 1 (firing, will make statinary).

Image 2 (not firing, will make firing.)
[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18329363/char1aaa.bmp[/img]

This is where I got my inspiration to make this game from. Yes, thats right. I got it off of a joking image. :P
[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18329363/Dead_space_nes.jpg[/img]

I&#39;ll post more media soon!

[b][u]Update Log[/u][/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;6.9.11 ~ Started working on images.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b][u]Development Team[/u][/b]
Me
PK2Play

We&#39;re still looking for people! I want at least 5 on this team!

[b][u]Other Information[/u][/b]
If you would like to help me on this massive project, swing me a PM or add me on skype, xldarkwinglx. I don&#39;t like to turn people down, so anyone who has at least some knowledge of Game Maker can achieve this. 

If you don&#39;t have any talent with Game Maker, thats fine! You can still support us by putting the following as your signiture! It would be much appreciated!
[code][url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,495570.0.html]I support Dead Space -New Realms-[/url][/code]

Thanks for checking this out and I will keep you updated with this!

Version 1 release will most likely be out by the end of Summer. I will put a site up when we&#39;re ready for beta.</description>

<p>Welcome to New Realms, your life doesn’t have to be limited to earth!</p>
<p>New Realms is a village in space that lets people escape from earth and start a new life in space. Not all ends well in New Realms. As they start moving further and further out into space strange and gruesome deaths start happening, and no one knows why. As more people start dying the deaths pick up, soon most of the bodies weren’t found. Then they broke loose. A huge swarm of Nechromorphs storm New Realms and kill just about everyone except for Blake Orr and a few people who escaped these horrible creatures. Your job is to keep the Necromorphs under control until a elite unit comes to your aid.</p>
<p>Hey guys! As you saw I’m making a game of Dead Space. This isn’t going to be like an ordinary Dead Space. It’s going to be an 8bit side scroller. This will be my first attempt at anything other than a private server. I’ll be using Game Maker from Yoyo games. I know this is a long shot and I’m really in over my head, but I think I can make this work.</p>
<p>I got the inspiration for this actually from a picture (posted below) and I thought it would be really cool to make this. I have a lot of expectations for this. I would like to make multiple minigames and other game modes.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Game Modes</span></span><br>
I am planning on having at least 4 different modes: story mode, free play, glory mode, and expedition. Story mode would be the regular story of course. You would play through the story line and beat the game and unlock Free Play and Glory Mode. Free play would be you could choose any area you would wish to start at and work your way around. I’m also hoping that I can make it so you can play as different characters that you meet up with throughout the story. Glory mode would be basically the hard version of the regular story, but wouldn’t have any dialogs or anything that would stop you. So basically you would just run right on through the levels until the end. You would unlock the free play characters this way. Expedition would be unlocked after Glory Mode is complete. That would be playing from the elite units site of things. You would probably stay in a hip for the most part and kill the Necromorphs as you make your way to help New Realms.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Online</span></span><br>
I would like to make an online version of this game in multiple modes. This would include Free play and other minigame modes. I would also like to make a highscores type of thing.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Minigames</span></span><br>
I would definatly have a Necromorphs blaster minigame. You would just have to run through blasting away and killing as many as you can before you die. I would also like to have PvP mode where you could fight each other. I might think up of some other minigames as I go along but for now thats all (at least for version 1).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">What are you making this with?</span></span><br>
I will be making this with Game Maker and simple paint images.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Would you need any help?</span></span><br>
If you would like to be a part of this I would most likely let you given you have a fairly good knowledge of Game Maker. I have only started on the images at the moment.</p>

<p>This is where I got my inspiration to make this game from. Yes, thats right. I got it off of a joking image. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
