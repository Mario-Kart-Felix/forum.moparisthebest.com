    <title>P Hats and Duplicating</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/p-hats-and-duplicating/22924</link>
    <description>Ok, so here we go with the report I promised earlier on 2 different threads (Halloween...ugly and I don&#39;t remember what, because it was several days ago). So, here we go:
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
The Basic Story
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/
When party hats were first came to the RuneScape world, they were very 
commonly found and had no store value.  Actully, they were so common that players 
would sell them to the general stores for absolutely no profit.  Later, some 
players decided to increase the rarity of party hats by collecting them and 
storing them away in their bank accounts.  These players would go around 
buying every party hat in sight.  Because of the low value of party hats, they 
collected so many that the hats started to disappear.  This seriously affected 
the RuneScape economy.  At first, players were giving up expensive pieces of 
armor for these worthless, paper hats.  Yet, after seeing how the prices were 
jumping, players decided to hold on to their hats and refused to sell them, 
which increased the value even more.  Soon, these worthless hats became 
treasured collectors items that sold for millions upon millions of gold 
pieces.

On the night of November 6, 2003, there were several rumors going around that 
RuneScape items could now be duplicated.  Not much later, a record amount of 
party hat owners and sellers show up in world one market and begin to sell 
them for very cheap prices.  Near the end of the day, several merchants were 
selling full inventories of pink party hats for nearly three fourths of the 
price.  Fellow RuneScape players become suspicious.

On November 7, 2003, Jagex has announced that a major bug has been discovered 
and that several RuneScape players were duplicating items, mainly party hats 
and Christmas crackers.  These duplications are against the RuneScape rules 
but even more importantly; it highly effected the RuneScape economy.  Prices 
dropped dramatically and several players have quit the game because of high 
money losses.  Jagex announces that they will reward the first person to 
report how the bug works a free lifetime membership.  Within a couple hours, 
Jagex receives over 600 messages and they quickly shut down all the RuneScape
servers at approximately 10:45 A.M. (United States Central time).  The bug is 
quickly fixed yet no actions have been taken against the duplicators and 
duplications.  Jagex also announces that they are trying their best to take 
care of the unfair wealth and cheaters.  They advise their fellow RuneScape 
players to neither buy nor sell any party hats and to drop any party hats you 
currently own in which you believe could be a duplication.

Unsurprisingly, RuneScape players don&#39;t listen to a word that Jagex says. That
very night, numerous low level characters stand around world 1 market trying 
to purchase and sell party hats at very low prices.  The RuneScape economy 
seems doomed because of the tragic money losses.  Very few actually understand
what this bug was and how it worked.  It is still unknown as to what actions 
Jagex will take against these duplications and tragic money losses.  Majority 
of the on-going rumors say that the duplicates will be easy to spot and delete
from the Jagex database.  Other rumors say that party hats will finally be un-
tradable to control all the unfair wealth and greed.

/\/\/\/\/\/\
Weeks later
\/\/\/\/\/\/

Still not everything has been taken care of.  The Christmas cracker duplicates 
have been deleted but duplicated party hats are still among us and the prices 
are still at an all time low.  Rumors of party hats being dropped again were 
going around yet it was not true.  Unfortunately, this seems like the end of 
the duplication issue.  Party hats are everywhere and the prices are low yet 
still rising.

/\/\/\/\/\/\
Months later
\/\/\/\/\/\/

A final update.  The results are finally verified.  Yes, the few players that 
understood the duplication bug were in fact banned.  The bug was fixed, 
duplicated Christmas crackers were deleted, but party hat duplications are 
still around.  Party hat prices are finally rising very slowly and will 
eventually pass the recent peaks.  There are no more worries about value 
drops.  The whole ordeal is over. 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
&quot;Future Drops&quot;
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

Many rumors about future drops have been going around.  Some say that Jagex 
has put a stop to holiday items because of the &quot;unfair wealth&quot; that they have 
caused.  Yet, if Jagex does continue holiday item drops, the rules that were 
placed upon bunny ears and scythes will affect all future holiday drops.

Yet, after 2 holiday item cancellations, it seems as if this is the end of all 
the holiday drops.  Certain events might take place during holidays in the new 
RuneScape but never in the classic version.

Hope you enjoyed this report  :D</description>

<p>ROFL! seriously theres no need to lie, its pretty obvious that you are. but i remember when i first started playing, the most expensive party hat was only like 8m. and santas were going for 300-350k. i had 3 santas and 2 green masks at this time, then sold them and quit runescape for 3 months and when i came back all the rares had rose so much. it blowed cause if i didnt sell them i woulda been so rich in RS</p>

Sorry if this counts as grave diging, but I think this report is pretty good and people deserve to know of it, unlike some threads that are outdated and of no use anymore(this on the other hand is still of quite some use for those who newly joind the Mopar forums.</p>

              <p>partly, its also an incredibly handy database, with all sorts of calculators, timers, quest guides, ect.<br>
It might not have some of the recent stuff tho, and if ur interested in somtin like SS, then you want RunescapeDraco(also RSD) It’s also a small database, but unlike SS its virus-free(I think it has just as much features…)</p>
