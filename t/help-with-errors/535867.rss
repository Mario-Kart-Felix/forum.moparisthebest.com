    <title>Help With Errors</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-errors/535867</link>
    <description>Hello,

Before I start I would like to say that I have been into RSPS programming for about 4 years now. Java has always been very difficult to understand for me and I still continue to struggle. That being said, I hope that someone can help me with the following problem,

I recently downloaded the &quot;Twisted PK&quot; source + client package and I have found that if you compile the source, many errors come up. I was wondering if anyone could upload a fixed source or give me an explanatory set of solutions to the multiple errors. This would greatly help, and if anyone had any free time on their hands to try and explain some java to me, it would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Slave</description>
