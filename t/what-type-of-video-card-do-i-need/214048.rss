              <p>Your computer is too old to be upgraded to a new graphics card. You might be able to find an AGP graphics card, but after upgrading, your old 2002 machine would probably have other components that are too slow. I recommend you get a new computer if possible.</p>

<p>exactly.  You still use PCI for things like extra USB / firewire ports or sound cards.  If you don’t want on-board sound, then PCI is a must.</p>

<p>a mobo still running on AGP slots won’t have 6400 slots, and an Athlon X2 / PCI-E mobo wont have 2100.</p>

Payback, with graphics cards you are going to need to learn that through the years motherboards have upgraded to support better graphics cards. This means that most of the high end graphics cards out today wont actually fit into your pc.</p>
<p>It is most likely that you motherboard is of type “AGP”. However most of todays system’s (2004+) graphics cards use a newer slot called PCI-E (pci express).</p>
<p>Find out what type of graphics card your motherboard takes. It’ll either be PCI or AGP, if it is PCI then I highly suggest you get a new motherboard. (PCI is not the same as earlier mentioned PCI-E). Both PCI and AGP are no longer put into motherboards.</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
May I ask how I figure out if its PCI or AGP?[/quote]<br>
Usually you can tell by looking at the information about your old graphics card or look what type of slot it has in the pc’s manual.</p>

<p>Its quite tricky to explain. Look at your motherboard, there should be a few white slots lined up (These are PCI slots, they house soundcards and all sorts of things).<br>
You may also however have a brown slot which is longer than the aforementioned PCI slots. This should be an AGP slot.</p>
<p>Is there any way you could take a picture of the motherboard?</p>
<p>here are some pictures of the slots:<br>
PCI:<br>

<p>and the brown slot in this picture is an AGP slot:<br>

              <p>[quote=“davidude36, post:4, topic:214048”]Payback, with graphics cards you are going to need to learn that through the years motherboards have upgraded to support better graphics cards. This means that most of the high end graphics cards out today wont actually fit into your pc.</p>
<p>It is most likely that you motherboard is of type “AGP”. However most of todays system’s (2004+) graphics cards use a newer slot called PCI-E (pci express).</p>
<p>Find out what type of graphics card your motherboard takes. It’ll either be PCI or AGP, if it is PCI then I highly suggest you get a new motherboard. (PCI is not the same as earlier mentioned PCI-E). Both PCI and AGP are no longer put into motherboards.[/quote]<br>
May I ask how I figure out if its PCI or AGP?</p>
