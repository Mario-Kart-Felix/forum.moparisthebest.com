    <title>Server already in use</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-already-in-use/235577</link>
    <description>i keep getting the error that my server is already in use,

when i attempt to get online i get an error stating the server is already in use.  This is the deltascape source offered by delta himself.

I figured out how to take off the anti-leech.

i portforwarded using utorrent.

i compiled everything and im attempting to run the server when it comes up with the message of the century
&quot;server is already in use&quot;

how can i come about this?</description>

<p>thanks for your help, first guy helped out thanks to him <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>but i was not advertising i was merely showing the ip to see if maybe it was a problem, but i see you have no dignity or remorse towards others problems. If you want to report me, feel free too, but i will keep this here stating that it was for intentional purposes of server development and not advertising.  I do not intend to run this server online.  In fact i am making a brand new source.  Please do not judge too hastily when you have no clue what the person is doing.</p>
<p>As for advertising, it seems your signature is advertising is it not?</p>
