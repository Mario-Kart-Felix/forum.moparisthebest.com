    <title>Considerations for making a password manager</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/considerations-for-making-a-password-manager/547535</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m going to work on a personal password manager, and would like to know what your thoughts are. Yes, I know there are a plethora of other password managers out there, but I&#39;m just doing it as more of an exercise. A lot of the current password managers use a master password that unlocks every stored password. What I&#39;m thinking of having is having not only the master password, but also a Google authentication token as well. I might make it modular enough that you can add as many layers as you want, and allowing you to specify specific layers per password (ie. having your facebook password use the Google token, and your email use the google token, and a private key stored on your hard drive).

What are some other considerations I should take into account?</description>

              <p>Perhaps have the manager generate complicated passwords automatically and remember them. This way, the only password a user will have to remember is the master.</p>
<p>Also, if it is available, have the option to use a fingerprint instead of master password?</p>

It would be interesting to use SMS authentication.<br>

<p>I thought about that as well, but then the situation arises where the person might not be in cell service range, and now they are unable to receive SMS. Whereas with the Google authenticator, it’s based solely on the time, which is universal.[/quote]if they have no cell service, then they probably dont have internet access either hence no need for passwords (which are nearly always linked to online accounts)</p>
