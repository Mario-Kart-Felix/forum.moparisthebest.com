    <description>hey guys, I know this is in the wrong section and I&#39;m sorry but I am in desperate need of help, I&#39;v searched everywhere and can&#39;t find help! Okay so I have a web host and I want a free forum that can use the host that I already have (I need it to use the host I already have for voting). But that also gives me quite a bit of things I can do/change on the forums, I have myBB currently but it doesn&#39;t do all the things I need. So can anyone help? And again, I&#39;m sorry for putting this in the wrong section.</description>
