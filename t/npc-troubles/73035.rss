    <title>NPC Troubles</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-troubles/73035</link>
    <description>Hey guys.

My server is up and running, and all of that. Just got a minor problem with my NPCs. Is there something that can actually to make them die. Because it seems on my server, some of the NPCs don&#39;t die. 

Thanks.</description>
