    <description>Yz, even though at times I saw him as a bit of a raging homo didn&#39;t deserve to be demodded, and then threatened with a ban by a returning GMod because of his topic, let us be fair - If someone gets demodded for a good ol&#39; bit of password skemming. Then, gets remodded, and locks a topic adressing the issue, then threatens to ban the topic creator.THEN THERE IS A BIT OF ABUSE GOING ON HERE.

But uno, the bottom line is - LOLOLOLOL YZ GOT DEMODDED FOR FUCK ALL AND A SCAMMING RETARD GOT G-MODDED AGAIN AND ALRADY HAS STARTED 2 BUSE LOLOLOL

P.s, if I get banned I would like it known LOLOL SILABS EMAIL HAS NEWDS OF HER THAT SHE&#39;S BEEN SENDING AROUND LIKE A LITTLE E-WHORE LOLOLOL AND LOTHY TRIES DEFENDING THAT BY SAYIN JEEBLES IS SKIDDY FOR DOIN IT CUZ IT REVEALED HIS INTERNET-LOVE LOLOLOL!!!</description>

              <p>Let’s just say that <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> staff members inputs and suggestions are given thought, just as all of yours are.  When attempting to improve the forum we certainly do not look at the rank of the member and judge the suggestion like that, but instead treat everyone as equals with their own opinion that deserves to be heard.</p>
<p>In regards to the staff members having a blind eye at another moderator’s decisions and actions, oh please, I beg to differ.  There is a reason why we have members we like to call admins on these forums.  If you do not like a decision a moderator has made, or simply feel it was a wrong-doing, then pm them.  Has much as we’d all like to believe it doesn’t work because the admins don’t reply, it doesn’t mean they haven’t looked into a situation.  If you seriously believe an admin has not done anything about it, pm a global mod, and they will do their best to bring it to the attention of the staff member, and attempt to alter the situation to a positive one.  Why else do you believe we are here?  Yes, we are here to moderate, but we are also here to make your time here better, as much bullshit as that may sound it’s true.</p>
<p>In this particular situation a member of the staff team moderated frank_ for a justifiable reason, and later realize that frank_ has been unmoderated.  A topic was posted about the situation, and Yz owned up to it.  Yz, being a moderator only on MoparScape was instructed to only use his powers on MoparScape unless under the circumstance of an emergency over here.  Disobeying this rule, and the common sense rule of removing another moderator’s action without confrontation with that moderator yz was demodded.  Yz, thought the warning was completely unfair, and personally, I believe he got off lucky, seeing as none of his other awards were removed, and he still has access to the community member section.</p>
<p>And in regards to Silab getting gmod again, she was given a second chance two years later, and personally I think she has likely learned her lesson.  Additionally, as MoparScape Senior moderator she did a fine job.  Had she not, it was very unlikely she would ever regain the position.  It is possible that in the future Yz could regain the status, but I assure you it will not be an easy thing to regain.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Greeny, post:8, topic:248585”]As I said in the mod section, it’s been done so many times before and gone unpunished. Funny how all the admins are turning a blind eye to that though and coming out with bullshit which equates to “I don’t remember” or “Did it?”.</p>
<p>The forum is not a democracy it’s a dictatorship and the so called elitism problem stretches right up to the top. You say we don’t see the problems elitism causes because we are the elitists, well right back at you. Hypocrites.[/quote]<br>
Greeny has an extremely fair point, the staff do turn a blind eye here and there, but thats to be expected if the staff have friends within the community. So obviously that will never change. And as Mopman said, we shouldnt necessarily get a say because it is by and large a privallege and not a right to use MITB. So they can do whatever they like and we have to accept it if we want to continue using Mitb. I personally think that Yz shouldn’t have got demodded, that was an overly harsh verdict, maybe a mute and a temporary demodding while he was muted. But nothing more. Everyone is allowed to make a few mistakes here and there. So why not give him another chance when others have received theirs?</p>

              <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:6, topic:248585”]This forum is very much democratic, as is moparscape. Contrary to popular belief, Niall and I don’t just carry out actions on our own accord; at the very least we consult each other, and if the choice being made doesn’t have to made in an extremely timely manner then we consult other staff members too.<br>
Various decisions, such as gmod choices, are not made without consulting all staff members. Other critical decisions are also made in such a manner; there are numerous things that we don’t take lightly, and this being the case we often take a conservative approach to them.</p>
<p>Moderators abusing their powers (especially when the use of their powers is conditional - for example, Yz was only allowed to use his warning abilities on moparscape with the exception of extreme circumstances) is an issue that we take very seriously. Ollie pretty much summed it up in another topic:</p>
<p>[quote author=Ollie link=topic=327213.msg2563912#msg2563912 date=1228289559]<br>
…unfortunately for Yz, he seems like a nice fella but you cannot disobey the rules. what kind of impression would it leave if you got away with it? get mod and unmute your friends! with no consequences!<br>
[/quote][/quote]<br>
Imo, if you do not do what your doing then the community will fall a part.</p>
