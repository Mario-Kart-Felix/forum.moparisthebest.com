              <p>Is it because, you have deleted the server source and trying to cut and paste it?</p>
<p>If so, that doesn’t work. You must have the main server source folder in order to do this. If you have got the server source folder, then I don’t know what’s wrong.</p>
<p>Hoped this has helped.</p>
