    <title>Webclient, minor help required please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-minor-help-required-please/427704</link>
    <description>[size=14pt]Ive been trying to get a webclient going for my server for a few days now, and ive done eveything right, i know that.. but in every tutorial they always say, then upload your client.jar file.. (Where am i uploading itt?!) They make it sound like you supposed to upload it straight onto the page your webclient is on, but obviously you dont right? 

It would be much appreciated if someone could give me a hand quick! Somebody out there must of had the same problem as me :/ ive never made a webclient before, so i have no idea whats right and wrong...

so yeah! please reply someone, thanks.

Oh AND could someone tell me what hosters to use for a 317 webclient, no one says anythign about that either, you just have to quess :P
