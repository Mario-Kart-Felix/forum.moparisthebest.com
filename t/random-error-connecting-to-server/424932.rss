    <description>Hey guys, I was logging into my server one day to make a few changes, but it kepy saying &quot;error connecting to server&quot;. I didn&#39;t change anything since i logged off last.. My server IP is still the same. No-ip is still working. It was working for WEEKS before this. I&#39;m not getting any error messages or anything, it just says &quot;error connecting to server&quot; Keep in mind I didn&#39;t change anything since it was last working.</description>
