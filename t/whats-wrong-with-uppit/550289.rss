    <title>What&#39;s wrong with Uppit?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-wrong-with-uppit/550289</link>
    <description>I used Uppit to upload my cache and jar file. Personally I find it very easy to use, and it could be debated that it is even easier and faster to use than Dropbox. I just don&#39;t understand why it isn&#39;t used more often and why Dropbox is usually preferred over Uppit. I may be wrong but I would just like to know.</description>

Because uppit doesn’t support instant download links?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>No it does, if you click the “generate link” button you will see another button which says “download” which you right click and there you can obtain the direct link.[/quote]<br>
Yeah, see… That’s extra work. And also that link you’re talking about can change (I think there is a reason it says “Generate”)<br>
On dropbox (though this changed in an update), they would give you a public folder. You would be able to <span class="bbcode-i">literally</span> drop files into the folder, right click, and hit copy link.</p>
<p>And you’d have the instant download link and be good to go.</p>
<p>Also, another thing, dropbox probably has more servers worldwide than uppit. I’ve heard many people complain that uppit wouldn’t work whatsoever.</p>

<p>You can’t really compare the two. Dropbox has about 500 million more features than uppit and is a different service. Uppit works fine if you’re just uploading a file you want to never change, but besides that it doesn’t really do anything. Dropbox lets you manage files, permissions, sync, has a desktop app, the list goes on and on and on.</p>

<p>Alright my good sir, thank-you for the detailed response. However, I still feel Uppit is more helpful in my case but regardless the comparison is useful the see.</p>
