    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-non-mysql-version-question/477327</link>
    <description>My co-owner accidentally IP banned my account, nbd right?  Well when it happened it gave the 6 people who were online items they should not of received.  Is there a way I can remove just the items from the peoples bank and inventories since this is a non MYSQL source?  Or am I screwed and I need to delete all the accounts affected?</description>

login to their accounts and destroy items simple since your owner you can easily get their passwords -.-<br>

My co-owner accidentally IP banned my account, nbd right?  Well when it happened it gave the 6 people who were online items they should not of received.

<p>Unless you know exactly which items they have that they shouldn’t, and know that they haven’t traded them to anyone, it’s going to be tough.[/quote]</p>
<p>Some are not even on so some they are just in the inventory, others some could be in bank, I know all the amounts of items.  It is only 3 people now.  Is there a certain file I can edit or do I have to base it on trust or just delete the accounts affected by it?</p>
