Hehe I have thought about why evolution would bring about so many homosexuals (especially recently). I think it has to do with overpopulation. With almost any species, if there is overpopulation, there is a huge increase in homosexuality for a while until the population size shrinks down again. So I guess it is like a safeguard against overpopulation (as we all know that homo’s won’t be reproducing any time soon). We need to thank the gays and lesbos otherwise one day we may not have been able to feed our kids!<br>

Did you drop out in preschool?</p>
<p>For one, recent numbers in homosexuality is because society is becoming more accepting, and gay people don’t feel obliged to hide themselves for their safety as much, anymore.</p>
<p>And two, “Homo’s won’t be reproducing anytime soon”- Homo’s do not come from other Homo’s, you douche bag. A gay person just got born then, and another one FROM A WOMAN.</p>

<p>Way to take what I said and spin it around so something completely different comes out. Congrats <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If you can honestly tell me that two gay dudes or two lesbian women can have children, then I think you are the one who dropped out of preschool. But we both know that’s not what you meant right? See, I can spin shit around too, but I try not to because it’s a complete waste of time for both of us.</p>
<p>If I really have to explain everything in layman’s terms, let me know and I will. Sorry if I assumed you could understand things at a higher level. Argue with facts all day if you want kid, but there ain’t much you can do about it - when an animal population grows too big, there is an increase in the ratio of homosexuals to heterosexuals.</p>
<p>PS: There is research that suggests that a lot of homosexuals come from very fertile females and could well act as a check against over population. It’s all over the net, but no one knows the answers. Don’t get so aggressive when you hear something that you don’t understand or don’t agree with. Instead, be open to new ideas and if you still don’t agree, post intellectual reasons why you don’t agree - not immature responses that only bring out anger and confusion.</p>
<p>And just curious, are you emo? Looked that way from a pic in another topic.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 13, 2008, 06:56:41 am[/size][hr][quote=“yakman, post:241, topic:4073”][quote author=Zero187 link=topic=5139.msg2579422#msg2579422 date=1229169937]<br>

<p>Are you positive? To be honest, humans really don’t know much about how evolution works and if it has anything to do with our thought process or not. There has been a recent increase in awareness of population increase, and if evolution does have something to do with how/what we think, then my theory could very well be possible. Now we all know that I am just stating a theory, not trying to prove anything. If this is the wrong forum to try and share opinions and ideas, let me know and I’ll definitely move somewhere else <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Ignoring the fact that your first two paragraphs are a laughable act of defense towards your stupidity, i’ll continue.</p>
<p>Do you have proven facts that there are more homosexuals than heterosexuals in a growing population? Statistics, back up of evidence?<br>
It’s proven that 1 in 10 people are Gay. Hmm, by those numbers, I don’t see how your “facts” are valid at all.</p>
<p>Woman don’t have an inbuilt satellite to detect when there is overpopulation, nor does the human body have any sense at all as to population- not enough to completely alter a gene and make someone gay.</p>
<p>If no-one knows the answers, then the argument is also void. They are theories, so don’t ignore proven facts as oppose to things you read off the internet to sound smart.</p>
<p>“With almost any species, if there is overpopulation, there is a huge increase in homosexuality for a while until the population size shrinks down again.”<br>
This makes absolutely no sense. PROVE it, or at least explain how it works. Like i said, there is no way that population could effect a fetus’s DNA.</p>
<p>“(as we all know that homo’s won’t be reproducing any time soon)”<br>
You call me close minded and spinning your words when you say this? What are you implying? And let me confirm, FACTS, please? We’re all dieing to hear your made up theories. Why won’t Homosexuals been reproducing anytime soon? By the way, the reproduction implication is aimed at Homosexual(s), like you said; plural. Implying that Homosexuals reproduce together, which is why I called you a douche bag.</p>
<p>Instead of telling me to think about my posts, I think you’re the one that needs the thinking.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/emo.html">@EMO</a>-<br>
How long ago was the photo? A common misconception with black hair and “emo”-ness is always deceiving. I’m not emo, actually a very happy person.  My hair isn’t black anymore.</p>

        <p>Whoa Mr. Scientist. If you want a full college report on this, you are gonna have to go somewhere else. I simply mentioned a known theory that has been floating around for about a decade now. I’m not saying that the theory is correct, I am just stating an opinion, by simply opening up the possibilities for a somewhat on-topic discussion (as those are very rare around here).</p>
<p>My response to you wasn’t defending my theory, but instead on the fact that you are so defensive and rude in all your responses, which once again you have proven to me that I am correct.</p>
<p>Please, if you really care so much about these homo’s maybe you should go to college studying that or something?</p>

Hehe I have thought about why evolution would bring about so many homosexuals (especially recently).<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s just society is more accepting of them so more people come out of the closet, there’s not a larger percentage of people who are homeosexual.[/quote]</p>
<p>Could very well be a possibility, I like the ideas, trying to think of more abstract ones while I’m bored but the good old coming out of the closet makes sense. My roommate is gay and I talk with him a lot about this stuff and whether being gay is a choice or not.</p>
<p>I do not think it is a choice, but roots down to a deeper attraction they are born with.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Hehe I have thought about why evolution would bring about so many homosexuals (especially recently). I think it has to do with overpopulation. With almost any species, if there is overpopulation, there is a huge increase in homosexuality for a while until the population size shrinks down again. So I guess it is like a safeguard against overpopulation (as we all know that homo’s won’t be reproducing any time soon). We need to thank the gays and lesbos otherwise one day we may not have been able to feed our kids!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>also, you clearly have a distorted understanding of evolution.<br>
evolution doesnt do things “for the good of the species”, it will never hold them back so they dont overuse resources. evolution works on the level of genes, not on the level of species.</p>
<p>if a group of replicators uses up all its natural resources and drives itself extinct, well thats just too bad.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Are you positive? To be honest, humans really don’t know much about how evolution works and if it has anything to do with our thought process or not. There has been a recent increase in awareness of population increase, and if evolution does have something to do with how/what we think, then my theory could very well be possible. Now we all know that I am just stating a theory, not trying to prove anything. If this is the wrong forum to try and share opinions and ideas, let me know and I’ll definitely move somewhere else :P[/quote]</p>
<p>seeing as the theory of evolution has been around for 200 years and academia has masses of specimens to learn from, i would say we have a pretty good idea to how evolution works, and it doesnt work on the level of species, it works on the level of genes, and only genes.</p>
<p>its simply not possible to have a thought process influence evolution.</p>
<p>however, you are from america, and your country leads the world in ignorance and misunderstanding of evolution. Your attidute is to be expected.</p>
<p>it has nothing to do with overpopulation,<br>
homosexuality is mentioned in the bible, and im pretty sure that 2000 years ago, overpopulation was not a problem.<br>
^^ your theory blown out of the water, kthxbye</p>
<p>also, some homosexuals have a wife/husband and children, perhaps because of their society or they dont admit it to themself, or something like that.</p>

        <p>Just to clear things up when I said 2 homo’s couldn’t have children I was being as blatant as possible, meaning that two guys can’t make kids and two girls alone can’t make kids. Of course people can adopt, or get sperm transfers or whatever crazy science practice, but I wasn’t referring to that.</p>
<p>And <a class="mention" href="../../u/yakman.html">@yakman</a>: Our theory of evolution is constantly changing and theories are constantly being made. We really don’t know much about how evolution works, we have only observed it and know some of its possibilities. Recent studies have shown there may be much more to evolution than just mutate and the dominant reproduce. My theory (it’s not really “my” theory) is just a possibility and no one has proven it wrong yet.</p>

        <blockquote>It's just society is more accepting of them so more people come out of the closet, there's not a larger percentage of people who are homeosexual.</blockquote>
<p>This is accepting the “People are born gay” point of view…</p>
<p>Let us say for the sake of argument that sexual orientation is related only to sexual activity, not to sexual thoughts or feelings. It follows that being gay is a choice. However this is not a satisfying explanation when you talk about the thoughts and feelings of homosexuality… because people are not aware of the vast majority of their thoughts or feelings, or where they come from. They are only aware of the motions they act out in deference to the real thought and real feeling, which is lost somewhere in the hustle of life. Everything comes from something else, and even if you are not <span class="bbcode-b">aware</span> of the something else, you still have a choice in the here and now. And that’s all there is. Here. Now.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some species of animals make love for pleasure, and some of those species are known to indulge in gay sex. So homosexuality is not an abomination, a terrible sin, etc…It just is, and it is a choice, just like it’s a choice to get up in the morning and wear a red shirt, or a blue shirt. It’s just a mask people put on.</p>
<p>So why is a larger percentage of the population becoming gay? Well, I haven’t even seen the statistic, so I can’t comment, except to say that it’s a tough question if you take the responsibility of realizing that everyone always has a choice in everything.</p>

<p>[QUOTE=moparisthebest]Man and Women were put on this earth, and like all the other animals on the earth they reproduced, the way they went about this reproduction is what we today call sex.  Sex is a reproductive tool, that is its function and only a man having sex with a women can fulfill that function, obviously our creator made us that way for a reason, we should and cannot be any other way(if youve ever seen our sex organs its obvious how they fit).</p>
<p>One big argument in favor of homosexuality is that it is not a choice, but in fact a gene that makes you attracted to your own sex, this is about the stupidest thing I have ever heard, because as far as I know, 2 men having “sex” cannot have children to pass a gene on to, and 2 women having “sex” cannot have children to pass a gene on to.  If this so called “gay gene” ever existed it would have died out centuries upon centuries ago.  That being said, its only logical to assume that <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">“being gay” is a CHOICE</span></span>.</p>
<p>any other arguements I can easily squash out for you guys? :)[/QUOTE]</p>

<p>Being mentally retarded is a CHOICE.   It doesn’t help reproduction rates, survival rates, or belongingness rates, the three basic needs for humans.  Any other arguments I can easily show my hick background on?  How fucking stupid can this god damn hick be.  :([/quote]</p>

        <p>[quote=“daycrawler, post:1, topic:4073”]Ok,<br>
Do you think people are born homosexuals? Do you think it’s a disease ? I personally don’t think they are born with it. God wouldn’t make people gay and then tell people to marry the opposite sex only. I also think that it can be a disease as like a physchological problem. Many of you may disagree with me. That’s why I want your opinions.[/quote]Lol, why does it have to be any of those options. There are gay people that know nothing about god, therefor they have no relation to it. I doubt it’s a disease, so what does that leave you? Perhaps personal choice?..</p>
