One big argument in favor of homosexuality is that it is not a choice, but in fact a gene that makes you attracted to your own sex, this is about the stupidest thing I have ever heard, because as far as I know, 2 men having “sex” cannot have children to pass a gene on to, and 2 women having “sex” cannot have children to pass a gene on to.  If this so called “gay gene” ever existed it would have died out centuries upon centuries ago.  That being said, its only logical to assume that <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">“being gay” is a CHOICE</span></span>.</p>
<p>any other arguements I can easily squash out for you guys? :)[/QUOTE]<br>
Your own.</p>
<p>Either you didn’t pay attention in 6th grade science class, or you’re choosing to ignore it.</p>
<p>Recessive genes need not be passed down through two gay people; it’s just as likely, if not more so, that were a gene to exist (which is not necessarily the argument for being innately gay, mind you, it’s just what you’ve decided to arbitrarily reduce it to), that a large number of people were carriers of it. Given the right mating-pair, the proper combination ensues, and you’ve got a homosexual child. Moreover, this could easily be complicated were <span class="bbcode-b">multiple genes</span> involved – and thus, you have the apparent rarity of homosexuality.</p>
<p>Have you never seen two blonde parents give birth to a child with dark black hair? Because the rest of the world has. That, of course, was an arbitrary example; if someone responds with, “But blonde is the recessive gene!” I will simply laugh at you.</p>
<p>And as I stated before, genes are not the only possible source of this. Irregular or complicated prenatal conditions could just as well be the cause.</p>
<p>You are oversimplifying the matter, and then ignoring what is fairly basic science to fit the conclusion you wished to reach from the outset. Distorting whatever it might take to confirm your own bias has nothing to do with rationality. That’s not “squashing” an argument, it’s charlatanism.[br][size=1]Posted at: June 27, 2006, 11:32:05 am[/size][hr][quote=“PaulT, post:60, topic:4073”]It’s a matter of logic, for me at least. We have free will to have sex with whoever we like. It’s a choice to engage in homosexual behaviors.</p>
<p>Saying homosexuality is not a choice is like saying “I never <span class="bbcode-b">chose</span> to like macs better than  PCs, I was just born that way”. Every choice we make in our lives is a result of all of the experience and knowledge we have gained throughout our lives, and everything we do under our free will is a result of a choice we personally have made.[/quote]<br>
This is just a reductio ad absurdum.</p>
<p>Does this make people who are heterosexuals <span class="bbcode-s">(which I guess is everyone in your view)</span> (is this a default state? is heterosexuality also “only” a choice?), but abstain from sex, completely asexual?</p>
<p>At a behavioral level, sure. The question remains: are they primarily attracted to their own sex, or the other? Little bit of both, maybe? No one at all? Homosexuality involves more than just whom you make sweet monkey love to, as numerous gender studies authors have repeatedly pointed out.</p>
<p>Edit: I should qualify this. I understand your position, I just feel that you’ve stopped short of making any real analysis of the question. How are you going to quantify behavior here, for example? Does any behavior which begins to approach a display of attraction to the opposite sex qualify you immediately for either homo- or bisexuality? If a man is attracted primarily to masculine ladies, and never vaginally penetrates a woman, but subsists entirely on oral and anal sex, can he still be called heterosexual? Is there an indiscriminate sexuality for those who have sex with whomever happens to be handy? If a person masturbates while thinking of horses, but never practices beastiality, is he a beastialist? I just can’t see how to answer these questions adequately if you never progress beyond the level of behavior.</p>
<p>You can not eliminate desire from the equation, or the question becomes sophistry and little more.</p>

        <p>I haven’t really read all these posts but heres my opinion. I think it’s stupid to think that you could be born with a ‘homosexual’ gene. However, your surroundings as a child/teen will affect your sexuality. Also, it’s kinda like saying ‘you like computers’, you’re born with it. No, it’s what you’ve been exposed to and also what you haven’t been exposed to.</p>

        <blockquote>Does this make people who are heterosexuals (which I guess is everyone in your view), but abstain from sex, completely asexual?</blockquote>
<p>Well, no. They still have the ability to reproduce and I’m assuming they still have the urge to.</p>
<blockquote>At a behavioral level, sure. The question remains: are they primarily attracted to their own sex, or the other? Little bit of both, maybe? Homosexuality is not merely a question of action, as numerous gender studies authors have repeatedly pointed out.</blockquote>
<p>Who (and what for that matter) we find attractive is a result of <span class="bbcode-b">choice</span>, just in a more complicated way than behavior is a result of choice. What people look for in a potential mate (physical attractives, cleverness, financial security, etc…) are things they have decided are attractive based upon their needs and lifestyle choices. Just because some choices are not obvious, doesn’t mean they aren’t choices.</p>
<p>In my opinion it boils down to: are people responsible for their behaviors? Shit man, I have the urge to do all kinds of crazy shit, and I never stop resisting the urge to do it. Does it make me crazy that I want to set things on fire, masturbate in public, etc? Well, not really. Homosexual lust doesn’t make you gay.</p>

<p>In my opinion you are just confused, just like scar for example. you’re wondering whether or not to enter color codes, they only way it will work is if you enter colors, same with sex. Only works one way, only meant to be used one way.</p>

        <p>Erm, please elucidate where I’ve failed to comprehend biology. I would very much appreciate it.</p>
<p>Firstly, I’ll mention how humourous it is that you slip in “all rights but marriage and children” when absolutely nothing else you’ve said had anything to do with it. This already betrays that you’ve got your agenda from the outset, and are more than likely going to come to the necessary conclusion to somehow back that up. Not that, of course, homosexuality being a choice <span class="bbcode-i">would</span> back that up in any way, as it could just as much be a responsible, rational decision in order to promote a particular human’s well-being and mental stability, thereby creating a home which would arguably be better than a great number of households provided by “normal” families.</p>
<p>But, to the meat of your… erm, objection? Why, for example, did you not bother to recognize the fact that “genes” are not all that you’re “born with”? There’s that roughly 9 month period where all kinds of crazy things are happening to the zygote/embryo/baby, and by all accounts, these have at least some sort of effect on the child. If homosexuality were somehow brought about at this stage, it would certainly still qualify as being born with it. But that complicates the issue, which is what those who would rapidly dismiss it either can not allow or are incapable of. Weigh the options more carefully, in the future.</p>
<p>For example, you seem to be under the impression that genes can only be transmitted or effected by means of reproduction, which is patently not the case. Lateral gene transfer is extremely well documented, if only in the past couple of decades. This is why many geneticists are gradually moving away from a “genetic tree” model for evolution; everyone is increasingly aware that it’s a far more complex issue than that. (We’re also seeing theories of inter-species breeding cropping up, which only complicates things further) Were LGT to occur early on in utero, say, by some random viral infection which is semi- but not particularly common, <em>neither</em> parent would have to be a carrier of a “gay gene” (nor, for that matter, would the two parents, in conjunction, have to be capable of producing the proper alleles or gene pairings or whathaveyou, if you aren’t prejudiced enough to limit yourself to this concept of “one gene = you’re a homo”).</p>
<p>As for “only X chromosomes,” this is silly at best. As I just alluded to, and stated in a previous post, this presumes that there is a single gene pair – ONE – which determines sexual preferences of a person, or else none at all? Hair color is more complex than that, which involves, at the very least, two gene pairs, and most likely a number more in order to account for the varying shades of colors. Let’s repeat that, just to be clear what we’re talking about: <span class="bbcode-b">HAIR COLOR</span>. Surely something as nuanced as sexuality would also require <span class="bbcode-i">more than a single gene</span>. You are completely ignoring the possible influence of blended phenotypes and co-dominance of alleles (which would, I suppose, be a possible explanation of bisexuality). And these are just what I, an very uninformed laymen, can think of off the top of my head.</p>
<p>I don’t know whether to attribute these repeated oversimplifications by just about everyone to general ignorance, laziness, maliciousness, a rabid inclination to disregard all facts and simply jump to the conclusions you want, … The list goes on.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, many of you are making a pitifully superficial analysis of what is outright STUMPING <span class="bbcode-b">professional geneticists</span>. You don’t find it a bit presumptuous that <span class="bbcode-i">you</span> happen to know the answers? Were the matter as simple as, “An XY chromosome can’t mate with an XY chromosome,” don’t you think the issue would have been put to rest by now? I really can’t comprehend this: why are a bunch of people, most of whom aren’t out of bloody high school yet, deciding that they understand an issue, where people who have been working in the field for god-knows-how-long don’t yet fully know what’s going on?</p>
<p>Think this through. Of course, it’s quite possible that I’ve completely failed to understand anything about biology. I don’t study it regularly and have at best a minor awareness of the subtleties involved. I’m sure I’ve already made some errors in what I said above, as I didn’t bother to take the time to refresh my memory on the topic.</p>
<p>Do enlighten me.</p>
