    <title>Homosexuality. Born with it or Disease?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/homosexuality-born-with-it-or-disease/4073</link>
    <description>Ok, 
Do you think people are born homosexuals? Do you think it&#39;s a disease ? I personally don&#39;t think they are born with it. God wouldn&#39;t make people gay and then tell people to marry the opposite sex only. I also think that it can be a disease as like a physchological problem. Many of you may disagree with me. That&#39;s why I want your opinions.</description>

<blockquote>What makes people gay? Biologists may never get a complete answer to that question, but researchers in Sweden have found one more sign that the answer lies in the structure of the brain. 
<p>Scientists at the Karolinska Institute studied brain scans of 90 gay and straight men and women, and found that the size of the two symmetrical halves of the brains of gay men more closely resembled those of straight women than they did straight men. In heterosexual women, the two halves of the brain are more or less the same size. In heterosexual men, the right hemisphere is slightly larger. Scans of the brains of gay men in the study, however, showed that their hemispheres were relatively symmetrical, like those of straight women, while the brains of homosexual women were asymmetrical like those of straight men. The number of nerves connecting the two sides of the brains of gay men were also more like the number in heterosexual women than in straight men.</p>
<p>Just what these brain differences mean is still not clear. Ever since 1991, when Simon LeVay first documented differences in the hypothalamus of gay and straight men, researchers have been struggling to understand what causes these differences to occur…</p>

<p>I agree, however I dont like the way you say “accepted in our mainstream culture” as though its some accident. That society just randomly accepted homosexual relationships and unfairly left out pedophiles.</p>
<p>Acceptance of homosexuals was probably arrived at with much careful thinking and discussion. In a homosexual relationship, two people can find love and be happy for the rest of their life. However it’s impossible for a relationship between a pedophile and a prepubescent child to be anything but filled with suffering.</p>
<p>I find it quite simple, try to maximise happyness and minimise suffering.</p>
<p>It is on this basis that civilised societies allow abortions up to a limit. They balance the suffering of a full grown conscious woman against the suffering of an unborn foetus which is unlikely to be capable of suffering.</p>

<p>you’re right in my opinion.</p>
<p>However the reason I dont like pedophiles but dont mind gays is that pedophiles almost always harm children while gays most likely dont harm anyone.[/quote]Based off what you hear from the mainstream news i presume. I am pretty sure there are many pedophiles out there who never molest children even if they have urges. It’s all about self discipline. The only reason homosexuality is socially accepted is the fact our mainstream culture decided it was OK.</p>

Heh, I assume he’s saying it just to go against the grain and piss people off, not even christians are that close-minded.<br>

<p>As i said that is just my opinion but honestly i think all goverments are responsible to teach their citizens how to (i cant think of a word). Sure noones perfect but the governent is here to help us. homosexuals need to be taught right from wrong. homosexuality is wrong. I respect the fact that many people disagree with me. Its not upto me to decide whether its right or wrong but that is just my opinion.[/quote]</p>
<p>New Hitler in the making here.</p>
<p>What right do you have over how someone else chooses to live their life? You seem to be religious, so I’ll just quote this:</p>
<p>“Let He who is without sin cast the first stone”</p>
<p>One person (Alan Turning) who without his help, the UK probably would have lost the second World War. He invented techniques for breaking German ciphers, namely the Enigma machine. Without his efforts, it’s unlikely we would have deciphered the messages.</p>
<p>Not only that…  He was also a major influence in mordern computing, he designed the first stored-program computer. Also in AI - he developed the Turning test.</p>
<p>He was found to be a Homosexual several years later. He was criminally prosecuted and forced to take female hormones (or go to jail). It’s alleged that this caused him to commit suicide.</p>
<p>I think that kind of treatment towards someone who did so much for a country and quite frankly the world, is fucking disgusting and makes me almost literally sick.</p>
<p>What if I said that religion is wrong and those afflicted with that disease should be prosecuted?</p>
<p>For the record, I am not gay. I don’t even think it is natural to be honest, but there is no reason to try and interfere with someone elses life, where you have no right to.</p>

<blockquote>A disease or medical condition is an abnormal condition of an organism that impairs bodily functions, associated with specific symptoms and signs.</blockquote>
<p>Like the bodily function of breeding? Various studies have linked homosexuality with a clear chemical difference in peoples brains. Maybe this is induced by making the choice to be gay, or maybe you really can be born with homosexual tendencies? Kind of like how a woman can naturally have more testosterone than the average woman, so looks like a man and likes physics.</p>
