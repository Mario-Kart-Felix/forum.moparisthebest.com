        <p>I think the hatred relates back to the days when the church was superior, as we know- in the bible it disrespects gays and forbids them and so that has been carried on over the centuries.</p>
<p>On another note, RegeX- who purchased the domain name ‘Easybakejews’ ? I thought you’d have disagreed with using that as a website after reading most of your posts.</p>

        <p>[quote=“RegeX, post:112, topic:4073”]Erm, I’m going to half-guess what you’re going to say, and you can say it for the negroes, Asians, Muslims, Afghan’s, of the world. Yet for many of those groups you’d be absolutely horrified if someone persecuted them?</p>
<p>World makes sense, doesn’t it.[/quote]</p>
<p>Alright, well it’s morning here, and I promised to give my explanation.</p>
<p>Sure, I grew/grow up in a society that influences me to dislike the fact that there are ‘gay’ people in the world (Alberta, Canada,) but I dislike them for a different reason. Being gay may be a birth-defect, it may be something you grow up to be, and I understand that. What makes me mad is the gay people who have to do all this stuff to make them feel more superior. Why to gay people have to get married? Sure, it has benefits such as Tax Benefits, also you can claim additional deductions and credits, but nowadays a lot of roomates, and college students, etc… in Canada are just getting married to recieve these benifits, they are not even gay.</p>
<p>Anyways, I’m rambling off-topic here. The real only thing that makes me mad about gay people is when they have to do all this stuff to make them feel ‘special.’ I mean, to straight people have straight parades? No, but it doesn’t seem to much of a problesm for gay people to have them. Seriously, what is the point of a gay parade? To be other gay people? No, its to boast around that they’re gay. Well surprise! No one cares. I don’t see why they need these kind of events, they just want attention. I wouldn’t have much of a problem for homosexuality, if they didn’t make such a big deal out of it.</p>
<p>I wish I still had my explanation from SRL, it was better… <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Oh, and by the way, I’m 14, not 12.</p>

<p>Basically all you said is the stupid ignorant shit that redneck Americans who refuse to adapt to anything believe in. No, often homosexuals do not a have concious choice, it’s the conditioning they recieve while they are young children, the social interaction that they participate in. Once you enter the teen years it starts to become too late to make any concious decision.</p>
<p>They are no child molesters, child molesters are just that, perverted people who molest children. If you want someone to blame for creating AIDS, maybe you should go find out how it came around.</p>

<p>To all you people that are horribly offended by gays, tough shit. There are reasons that the church is seperated from the state, and it’s to stop little religious issues like this changing the way that society forms and works. Seriously, gay couples can already adopt children. The fight is over, if you had problems you should have raised them then.</p>
<p>TBH I have no idea how you people can be so prejudiced, I guess it’s one of the quirks of living in the world’s most retarded nation.[/quote]</p>

<p>There is not room in this world for your greatness.</p>
<p>Cheese - The reason gay men get married is the same reason straight people get married.</p>
<p>The Gay Stereotype says they go on parades, but they don’t.</p>
<p>If you lined up a normal gay man and a normal straight man, you wouldn’t know the difference.</p>

What makes me mad is the gay people who have to do all this stuff to make them feel more superior. Why to gay people have to get married? Sure, it has benefits such as Tax Benefits, also you can claim additional deductions and credits, but nowadays a lot of roomates, and college students, etc… in Canada are just getting married to recieve these benifits, they are not even gay.<br>

<p>I’m not replying to these topics anymore. No matter what I say, there is always older people, with more intellegent minds to prove everything I say wrong <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>And yes, in Canada, some are just trying to legalize gay marriage for the benifits of taxes, even if there not gay! But I geuss thats a bit off-topic. Also, Canada legalized gay marriage.</p>

I mean, Everyone is probably thinking well thats crazy! A guy and his goat? Well, Thats the same way we feel about gay marriages. That it’s crazy and wrong. You are born 115% straight.</p>
