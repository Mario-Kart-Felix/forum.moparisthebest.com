    <title>Need command ::suggest and some other stuff</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-command-suggest-and-some-other-stuff/401933</link>
    <description>i need a code that when people do 
::suggest (message)
not ( ) of course
it sends the suggestion to a file in my server


is it possible to unjail someone without an unjail command?

is there a noclip command, if so what is it/ how do i add it in, just as regular command?</description>

<li>
<p>for the suggest command. You should make a new file called suggestions. then make something like writeLog(p.playerLastConnect, “suggestions”);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you mean? if someone is in jail that he can walk out or something? The most jails today you go to is the crafting guild where you need to mine 250 silver ores before u can leave.</p>

<p>tysm for the <span class="hashtag">#1</span>, <span class="hashtag">#2</span>, so in my jail, it is i do ::jail username, the user goes to jail and he cant leave untill he mines like 250 iron ore. if i tele him out he cant bank, so i want to be able to unjail ppl, here is my jail command</p>
<p>[code]            if (command.startsWith(“jail”) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 0) {<br>
try {<br>
String otherPName = command.substring(5);<br>
int otherPIndex = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(otherPName);</p>
<pre><code>                if (otherPIndex != -1) {
                    client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[otherPIndex];
                    p.toX = 2933;
		p.toY = 3285;
		p.action = 1;
                    p.sM(
                            "You have been jailed by " + playerName);
		sM("You have jailed "+p.playerName+".");
                } else {
                   sM("The name doesnt exist.");
                }
