    <description>Alright so basically; I am a noob when it comes to this and I&#39;m mainly doing it for educational purposes. I admit it so please spare me the &quot;newfag&quot; stuff  :palm:

I&#39;m having an issue, I cannot figure out what I did wrong to it. 
[size=7pt](as in I did barely any editing in this file, the problem arose on its self, if that&#39;s even possible!)[/size]  :|

As for the second error, again  :palm: No idea. I&#39;m not an idiot so if somebody could just tell me the problem and a solution, I&#39;ll understand it.</description>

              <p>Both the problems are pretty much the same.</p>
<p>1st problem = There is no method in your playerassisant that is refresh(int i);</p>
<p>2nd problem = There is no variable in your Client that is called height.(I think this should absZ but I’ve never worked with a P.I. before.) Also please make getters when your accessing variables in different classes.</p>
