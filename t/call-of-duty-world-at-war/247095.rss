    <title>Call of Duty: World at War</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/call-of-duty-world-at-war/247095</link>
    <description>After getting Call of Duty WaW, I have been playing it for about 8 hours and have a few opinions on the game. I just decided to put them together in this post after I lost my frustration with the game.

Pros:

[ul][li]Search preferences - I LOVE this feature, being Australian I don&#39;t have very good internet, so if it&#39;s anything other than an Aussie game, I get red connection with 6~ second delay.[/li]
[li]Guns - The guns aren&#39;t extremely powerful like they are in Call of Duty 4, you can&#39;t shoot through a water-cylinder, etc.[/li]
[li]Engine - It is built from the engine used in Call of Duty 4, which engine revolutionized console gaming, creating a faster gameplay, addicting gameplay and best of all, an extremely interactive gameplay.[/li]
[li]Added play lists - The new play lists are a good change compared to most of the play lists in previous versions.[/li][/ul]


Which, of course with &#39;pros&#39; you need &#39;cons&#39;.

Pros:

[ul][li]Respawn points - Call of Duty: World at War&#39;s respawn points are TERRIBLE. Seriously, I often have people respawn right behind me, within melee attack range.[/li]
[li]Bouncing Bettie&#39;s - Whilst they may be what they are like in real life, they are impossible to notice in game. They need to add a way for the opposing player to be able to recognize it.[/li]
[li]Dogs - I can agree the dogs are better than the Helicopter feature in #4, but the dogs are too powerful. They often swarm you, leaving you no where to go. This, also allows people to get higher kill streaks. With the dogs getting you a minimum of 15 kills, there is a pretty good kill-streak right there. They should only last 30 seconds, rather than 60. In a team death match, this is almost a quarter of the score done.[/li][/ul]


They&#39;re just my opinions I have gathered over 8 hours of playing. Feel free to forward your own.</description>

Or you could be cool and use the invincibility glitch on Nazi Zombies with a flamethrower, that’s good fun until about round 30, then it gets boring. I often watch TV while tapping R1 to flame the massing zombies every few seconds.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Tico135, post:25, topic:247095”]After playing it for a while I’ve noticed that the best strategy is to stay in the big room as long as completely possible (whenever several zombies start getting inside before you kill them), and then opening the upstairs, buy either the trench gun or bar, and sit there to about wave 10.  Then, open the downstairs, leading into the help room.  This allows you to open the help room and buy a random gun without opening the door to the big room.  This strategy works really well, and I’ve found myself getting to wave 18 or so with 3 other people.[/quote]Awful. The best strategy (proven, really, by myself and my brother) is to open the small extra side-room first - the one with the random weapon box - at around level 5. From here on out, you always attempt to buy a random gun and hope for a Ray Gun. Keep trying to get it, as you need it later on. Meanwhile, anybody with an LMG takes the door while the other player (maybe with an LMG or shotgun) takes the two windows and the cave-entrance. Once you have at least one ray gun, you open the staircase in the extra side-room and go upstairs (this should be around level 10-12). You run all the way into the far corner (trench gun is optional but not reccommended) where the other stair case exists (but it is closed/blocked off). In this corner, there is also a grenade respawn for points. You continue buying them and you throw grenades like crazy at the far section of the place and at the window to your right (next to the blocked off staircase). Also, fire your Ray Guns when neccessary.</p>
<p>Using this method, <span class="bbcode-b">JUST</span> my brother and I got to <span class="bbcode-b">level 21</span> on <span class="bbcode-b">split-screen</span>. We could’ve gotten a lot further but we forgot to check our feet, and a crawling zombie killed us.</p>

              <p>Nazi zombies is pretty cool, however it can also get very frustrating.  I find going through waves 1-6 is insanely boring, especially with 4 people.  I also believe that you should be able to stand a little better against them (perhaps maybe 3-4 hits from a zombie before you go to last stand?).</p>
<p>After playing it for a while I’ve noticed that the best strategy is to stay in the big room as long as completely possible (whenever several zombies start getting inside before you kill them), and then opening the upstairs, buy either the trench gun or bar, and sit there to about wave 10.  Then, open the downstairs, leading into the help room.  This allows you to open the help room and buy a random gun without opening the door to the big room.  This strategy works really well, and I’ve found myself getting to wave 18 or so with 3 other people.</p>

i have thoroughly assessed COD5 and i have come to the conclusion: Its shit. The story mode is too short, the online mode is incredibly buggy and ineffective the zombie mode(best bit) is pretty cool. The guns are weak, the choice of guns is pitiful as there are way too many semi’s and basically they all start mimicking each other. Respawns are fucking terrible, so eratic and indecisive. The overall flow of the game sucks as well. Its more dropping you in and all of sudden it starts and there are enemies here there and everywhere<br>

I take it you never played CoD4 back in november 07.[/quote]<br>
Yeah, best thing they ever did was re-design the spawn points.</p>

I don’t like the vehicles part at all, it ruins the practicality of the game. Before WaW, I liked CoD because it had no vehicles, and was just gamer v gamer.[/quote]<br>
totally agree tanks are just a new way for reatrds to get easy kills</p>
