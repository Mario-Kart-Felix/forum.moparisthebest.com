<p>yeh good point, i was getting excited because some person made his own mmo in 6 months, but i need to remember he allready had a game engine layed out, all he had to do was built onto it…</p>
<p>But im making something from scatch, making my own engine…</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!<br>
Im think im going to stick with making the terrain and models, then maybe getting someone else to do the scripting sides, but maybe one day (Java course in the Games Dev) i will be able to take what i learnt, and build upon it.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>But uh, a database is the least of your troubles. Where is your game engine coming from? Whos going to write the code to draw the world? What world format are you using? How are you going to handle connections? How are you going to handle world/object states? How are you going to keep load on the database down with all that stuff being streamed from it? etc etc etc</p>
<p>All of these questions have answers ofc, but until you know them, how do you expect to be able to write an MMORPG?</p>

If you’re interested in creating RPG’s, you will need to learn graphics design in Photoshop (for example) and you need to be advanced in the programming language that you will use.<br>
Also, please note that I said RPG and not MMORPG.</p>
<p>I edited my post. You will also need to learn what databases are used for, how they function and how you can manipulate data in them.</p>
<p>Protip: Don’t start with RPG’s, especially 3 dimensional ones that you are wanting to make.<br>
[/quote][/quote]<br>
I know what a database is used for, you use it to safe information, load information of it, build all your models and terrains together in a playable state etc… I just need a little help/push into any TuTs that can help me make a basic one, but then upgrade to a very powerful one.</p>
