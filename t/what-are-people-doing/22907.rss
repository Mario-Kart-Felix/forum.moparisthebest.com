    <title>What are people doing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-are-people-doing/22907</link>
    <description>I know that publicly-acknowledged bot systems are few and far between, but I&#39;m curious about the current state of cheating theory. I know that ruler is using color-finding. I don&#39;t know how ARGA works (is it still alive?). Presumably pplsuqbawlz and semaphore have some methodologies that are far beyond the ken of mere mortals :P

If anyone with a working program is willing to give a general overview of their methods, I would appreciate it.
Useful information would be things like are you hacking the loader (or [i]from[/i] the loader?), how far are you going to emulate a browser, does your program use information from the client to influence a human-interface-using program or do you hijack methods within client to perform actions? Runtime bytecode injection, download-&gt;static bytecode edit-&gt;run, or are any of you still using deobfuscated source in one way or another?

Bascially, I haven&#39;t looked at the new client for more than a few minutes since the day it was released and am looking to take advantage of any best practices that are already out there. Failing that, I&#39;m looking for info on what has already been tried/accomplished so that I can avoid retracing someone else&#39;s development.</description>

<p>It’s all data…you can sort it into groups of behavior types, you can regress average curve equations from it (to get a representation of ‘human’ usage, individual tweaking is possible later), you can try mixing the speed of sample group A with that weird spiral thing that people in group B tend to do, <span class="bbcode-i">et cetera</span>. If you’re going to create a mouse movement package that mimics a range of human usage patterns, you need the research to test against - it’s not like anyone would be using the data as preset paths.</p>

<p>I don’t think you understand frank_, we could use MoparScape to gather information such as Mouse Paths and mouse/keyboard patterns, such as timing clicks and keyboard presses etc etc.  How would that be a problem?  We couldn’t gather such statistics with a bot because no one would actually play on it.<br>
[/quote]i know what you meant, you should just keep the projects unrelated. if you have the data collection as an option in the bot, it will be more individual and unique[/quote]</p>
<p>But does it make sense to collect data from a bot that people wont be playing on themselves? that defeats the whole purpose, if actual human beings aren’t doing the input themselves then collecting data is useless.</p>

<p>It is done in bcel. We get the required information from the client and use it to calulate the screen positions of npc’s, object and eventually items. Inventory item stuff is done and it i suppose clicks like sbot3 atm. We will probaly have action hijacking for those wishing to use it.</p>
