    <title>Digimon vs Pokemon</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/digimon-vs-pokemon/434093</link>
    <description>Reyx7 thinks digimon &lt; pokemon, but i say digimon &gt; pokemon

let me tell you a story:

Digimon First came out as tamagotchis
[img]http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQfSBQD0EqFECwePVMMe0KtMZdCbeNFQCqK-VXqWICsaA7qTaPERROnpVs_[/img]
notice the digi-vice looks similar.

exactly the same. yes next came &quot;tamagotchi Digivice&quot; which you see up there. after that, pokemon came out in 1995. and people got to know it better then the tamagotchi Digivice. but pokemon saw how well Digimon was doing and before the games or the show, they made there own &quot;Virtual Pikachu&quot;
[img]http://pokemonsafari.net/static/i/pokemon-pikachu/pokemon-pikachu-grande.png[/img]
notice how it looks like a gameboy? but it still has the tamagotchi based Design on the game. in this case. there would be no pokemon without digimon.

next the show and games came out in late 1995, after the V.P, Digimon, looking how Pokemon and gamefreak were doing decided to give they&#39;re creation a go, and created a very popular show. Digimon Tamers.

Digimon: a show about a group of kids/teens trying to save the digital world
pokemon: a bratty 10 year old kid trys to become a pokemon master.

in my opinion the digimon storyline was the greatest.

What do you guys think?

              <p>I had the Tamagotchi things and the Digimon handheld devices as a kid. Also had most of the Pokemon games and watched both the shows, and I can say I well enjoyed the combination of both. I remember that the Pokemon games had more of an RPG aspect while the Digimon games were more fast paced and action games, so I can’t really compare that. As for the shows, I found both of them pretty cool as a kid. As for the cards, I always played Yu-Gi-Oh for that.</p>

<p>I liked the simplicity of Yu Gi Oh cards. I still have a few decks made up. However I do have over 4000 Pokemon cards under my bed in filled binders. I’ll probably sell a mass of them when/if cards ever bounce back. Computers have practically destroyed the trading card market.</p>

<p>I had thousands of Yu-Gi-Oh cards in 4th grade.  I taught my dad how to play and we battled each other all the time.  Than we moved houses and I left them all besides the god cards and my Exodious set, (if that was the name of that monster), which I kept in a binder that I packed as soon as I heard we were moving.  Than in 6th grade or something I went to my friends house and saw he had a secret stash of YuGiOh cards in his closet.  For the rest of that summer, me, Chris (the friend), and Steven (the friend’s stepbrother), played YuGiOh when no one else was around.  Fun fun fun.</p>

              <p>I liked the simplicity of Yu Gi Oh cards. I still have a few decks made up. However I do have over 4000 Pokemon cards under my bed in filled binders. I’ll probably sell a mass of them when/if cards ever bounce back. Computers have practically destroyed the trading card market.</p>

<p>Gundam???</p>
<p>Yugioh was cool because of the big monsters and the fact that it had a more structured game play. I’m not even sure how to play digimon, my brother and I used to play it like War.</p>
