&lt;title&gt;Marry Poppins&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Mary Poppins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mary Poppins Books by P.L Travers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first book, Mary Poppins, published in 1934, introduced the mysterious anti-heroine, a vain, acerbic magical English nanny blown by a windstorm to Number Seventeen Cherry-Tree Lane, London and into the Banks&#39; household to care for the Banks&#39; children; Jane (the eldest), Michael, and twin babies John and Barbara. Encounters with chimney sweeps, pavement artists, shopkeepers, and various adventures follow until Mary Poppins abruptly leaves. Her sudden return in Mary Poppins Comes Back heralds more of the same, as does Mary Poppins Opens the Door. The other books in the sequence, P.L. Travers explains in her introduction to Mary Poppins in the Park, describe incidents which happened during any of these three visits, for &#39;Mary could not forever arrive and depart.&#39;Some of the themes in the novels may have been influenced by the author&#39;s relationship with G. I. Gurdjieff, the Greek Armenian mystic and &quot;teacher of dancing&quot;, whom she met in 1938.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adaptations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Mary Poppins was made into a film by Walt Disney Productions in 1964 based on the series of children&#39;s books. According to the 40th anniversary DVD release of the film in 2004, Walt Disney first attempted to purchase the film rights to Mary Poppins from P.L. Travers as early as 1938 but was rebuffed because Travers did not believe a film version of her books would do justice to her creation. He finally succeeded in 1961, although Travers demanded and got script approval rights.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The relationship between Travers and Disney is detailed in Mary Poppins She Wrote, a biography of Travers, by Valerie Lawson, published by Aurum Press in the United Kingdom. The biography is the basis for two documentaries on Travers, The Real Mary Poppins and The Shadow of Mary Poppins.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The process of planning the film and composing the songs took about two years. Songs in the film are by the Sherman Brothers. Mary Poppins is played by Julie Andrews. Disney cast Dick Van Dyke in the key supporting role of Bert. The Banks children were played by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber. Mr and Mrs Banks were played by David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns respectively. The film is rated G by the MPAA.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Musical&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In December 2004, Mary Poppins: The Musical opened at the Prince Edward Theatre, London, after previewing in Bristol. It received critical acclaim and was nominated for nine 2005 Olivier Awards. It won two awards, Best Actress in a Musical, for Laura Michelle Kelly, and Best Theatre Choreography, for Matthew Bourne and Stephen Mear.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The musical has original music and lyrics by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, book by Julian Fellowes, and a few new songs and additional music and lyrics by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The musical opened on Broadway on November 16, 2006, starring Ashley Brown as Mary Poppins and Gavin Lee as Bert.

save it as what you like 

now then to save your file to an array just use this 
[php]
 $file = file(&quot;what ever.html&quot;);
[/php]
if you want to see how long the file is use this you need to count the lines first then use a loop to see how many there are
[php]
 $number_of_lines = count($file);
for ( $i = 0; $i &lt; $number_of_lines; $i++) {
  
   echo $file[$i]
  
 }
[/php]
that will re echo out the file if you would like to just re echo  out the html
use
[php]
 echo $i.&#39;: &#39;.htmlspecialchars($file[$i]).&#39;&lt;br/&gt;&#39;;
[/php]
if you look the $i.&#39;: &#39; will echo out the line number at the start the br at the end is jut so it dosent come out as one huge block which is quite hard to use / see 
but for a more basic echo of a file you can use 
[php]
 $file = file_get_contents(&quot;filename.html&quot;);
 echo($file);
[/php]
but yet again you can do this quicker you also can use
[php]
 readfile(&quot;filename.html&quot;);
[/php]
this is yet another way of doing it its called file handling 
set the file location
open the file (must use rb because of the binary and asy code that windows uses on lunix you could just use r  if you want)
get the whole file or the amount you want
close the file handle off to save memory
echo out the file
[php]
$file_location = &quot;file.html&quot;;
$file_handle = fopen($file_location,&#39;rb&#39;);
$file = fread($file_handle, filesize($file_location));
fclose($file_handle);
echo $file;
[/php]

to write to a file use this
get the original files 
get the txt file
get the amount of lines
get the handle to get ready wright
loop through the lines
strip the html tags
wright to the .txt doc
save some php memory
save to our new file
[php]
 $original_file = &quot;filename.html&quot;;
 $new_file = &quot;file.txt&quot;;
 $lines = file($original_file);
 $file_handle = fopen($new_file,&#39;w&#39;);
 foreach($lines as $line){ 
  $line = strip_tags($line);	
  fwrite($file_handle, $line);	 
 }	 
 fclose($file_handle);
 readfile($new_file);
[/php]
well this is more of my notes than anything i dont have time to make it into a tut because of my dad ffs lol! hope it helps</description>
