    <title>The Nether</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-nether/398173</link>
    <description>At first i thought the nether as a whole was glitched where you couldnt place blocks, but after a long while of wandering i managed to set myself on fire (lol) by client sided-ly lighting my way with flint and steel, after that i tried placing blocks and i could.

So i came to the conclusion that the same block protection for the spawn in the normal world is being applied in the nether? It would make sense since my nether portal spits me out at -9, 0.

But if this were completely right we wouldnt be able to break blocks either, so im not really completely sure this is the problem. 

Maybe if mitb could briefly disable the protection at spawn next time he is on and see if it affects the nether, we would know if thats what is causing it or not?

Well thats just my theory.</description>
