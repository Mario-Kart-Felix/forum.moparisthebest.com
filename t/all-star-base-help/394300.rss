    <description>Hi, I don&#39;t need much help except for the fact that if you guys know all-star or any base servers that work with all star, such as codes and all. Wondering if you guys can throw me some idea&#39;s for it. Such as increasing capacity, Mini-games, guides on cool stuff you would like on a server. This is completely all star based so Keep that in mind!</description>
