    <title>Need good gaming computer to ditch consoles</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-good-gaming-computer-to-ditch-consoles/404749</link>
    <description>So I have a $600-800 budget to try and get a good gaming rig, and im not the best at hardware so no building from scratch, even though its the best possible solution. Id prefer buying a decent desktop maybe 2.5-3.0ghz, few gb of ram, and switching out the graphics card to something that could easily run the majority of the games out there today.

I already have a mouse, monitor, speakers, and keyboard. Monitor is 1600x900

I want to try and get the desktop and the cards from a local Best Buy for the simple fact that its readily available and I can easily return components.

So looking online this was the first computer I saw, its basically an all in one package and I wouldn&#39;t be able to pay for a new graphics card for it:
http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Asus+-+Essentio+Desktop+/+Intel%26%23174%3B+Core%26%23153%3B+i7+Processor+/+8GB+Memory+/+1TB+Hard+Drive/2634096.p?id=1218341074379&amp;skuId=2634096

It comes with a GT 530, and by a quick google search it was said to be a low end card.


Heres my second finding: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/HP+-+Pavilion+Desktop+/+AMD+Athlon%26%23153%3B+II+Quad-Core+Processor+/+6GB+Memory+/+1TB+Hard+Drive/2670319.p?id=1218343206257&amp;skuId=2670319

Id probably put in a GTX 480 (if I can, halp) or any other high graphics card.


It seems like theres SO MANY different graphics cards I am honestly lost, so please help.


For comparison, im trying to beat my old laptop http://img829.imageshack.us/img829/9769/specse.png obviously the fact that its a laptop immediately jumped the price tag, as my current laptop was $1200. But desktops are so much easier to customize and alot cheaper.</description>

              <p>You don’t have to be good with hardware to build from scratch?  Have you ever built a, say Level 2, lego set?  Then you can easily build a computer (oh, you might also need to know how to use a philips screwdriver to put in about 10 screws).</p>
<p>So obviously I’d suggest you order all the parts from <a href="http://newegg.com">newegg.com</a> and build it.  For example, use the computer I built recently:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/builds/moparisthebest.html">https://www.moparisthebest.com/builds/moparisthebest.html</a> (I went with the Asus, not the MSI mobo)</p>
<p>It cost $339 dollars, without a video card.  (building from scratch you also need a case and power supply (about $50), and a hard drive (also about $50).  You can get a decent card for $150, or a top of the line one for around $300 dollars, it’s cheap and you would have one hell of a computer.</p>
