MOTIVATORS
Posted the same thread on mopar and my site, and you guys were actually intellgent and helped along with me :), send me more failed topics from other sites :D 
http://www.rune -server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/projects/231439-zerocomfor-317-golden-era-reproduction.html

I actually respect moparscape nowadays more, because i can see improvements coming in. The site is clean and basic, plus it doesn&#39;t have alot of flaming issues.
HOWEVER, there are still problems, and we all know that.

This vote gives you a choice of forums that you don&#39;t think are active enough, has flaming problems, and the members don&#39;t get banned enough.

I&#39;d say that you should vote for r-s
Reasons for my opnion: I just joined the r-s site, and I found all the flaming from here x100. I decided to post this topic NOT out of anger, but i want to see your opinions. Plz sho meh urz opinions</description>

<p>Exactly, that’s how the light-bulb was invented. When he had finally found the correct metal to use, after roughly a thousand tries (at least thats what I was told in History class back in High-School). When he was asked, if he thinks all of those other attempts  were a waste, he simply said, no, he learned a thousand ways <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> to make a lightbulb.</p>
<p>Simplify: Guessing can lead to some great things in life. I just used the lightbulb as an example.</p>

I have released some things (back when customs were the popular thing) to expand your Class8 to allow more items than it would typically hold. On here, it was treated with at least some respect. On R-S, I got shot down as if i was a piece of shit.</p>

i went on rune -server to release something and got a bunch of flame.<br>
i quit.<br>
rune -server &lt; MoparScape.<br>
Btw its sad that they have better programmers then us, compared to them we have less.<br>
maybe Graham, Prima and Pali.<br>

Palidino took code from winterlove to make it compatible with the new clients, anyone over at mitb could have done this. But everyone wanted to avoid using the winterlove server again because it was shit. Hes not that great.[/quote]</p>
<p>He is a good programmer, but he just does sloppy things, if you take a look at battlescape, it was coded pretty bad…</p>
<p>But his new base, with new combat is pretty sweet, and he also knows how a 317 client is, since he was the first with 562 everything on a 317.</p>

<p>Locus is probably the most diverse. Not community wise, but as a site. They’ve established more features than any RSPS community I’ve been to.</p>
<p>Frugoo is a family forum imo. I’ve spent a long time there in the past, and there’s nothing bad about that. When I was there, there wasn’t as much crybaby ass shit as there is here right now. There are a lot of idiots over there, but they’re still a family. We couldn’t hold ourselves together if the forum was at stake; hence our present situation.</p>

I agree with Prima 100%. I have released some things (back when customs were the popular thing) to expand your Class8 to allow more items than it would typically hold. On here, it was treated with at least some respect. On R-S, I got shot down as if i was a piece of shit.</p>
