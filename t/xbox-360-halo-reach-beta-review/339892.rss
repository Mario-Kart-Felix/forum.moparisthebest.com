    <title>[Xbox 360] Halo: Reach Beta Review</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xbox-360-halo-reach-beta-review/339892</link>
    <description>The game itself is made by Bungie, and Bungie is incorporated by Microsoft.

Halo: Reach is based on a 1st person shooter, and a futuristic/sci-fi game.
The era is around the year 2400. It is before the time of Halo 1, and during the battle of Spartan vs Covenant.

The story line is why Master &quot;Chief&quot; is the last of the Spartan race.

Now beta is out and about if you own the game Halo 2: ODST, you can download the game, but it does take up 1 GB of your hard drive.

Now heres my list of pros and cons.

[font=georgia][size=18pt][b]PROS[/b][/size][/font]

You now have the ability to change classes between what you would like such as the Call of Duty franchise. 

Spartans: Having jet packs, invisibility, running, and a mode called guard (invincible for 3 seconds). 

Elites: You have jet packs, invisibility, and rolling around (yes its cool)

The games graphics have drastically changed, and are a lot better then any other Halo game out. 

The guns have all had a make over change. The game also has new cool weapons such as: DMR (new battle rifle), Needle Rifle (looks like a new carbine, can&#39;t confirm), Plasma cannon ?(shoots plasma grenades and locks on), new Focus Rifle (replacing beam rifle i suppose), and  the Grenade launcher. Guns now hit a lot harder then usual, and hit calculations are very well done.

You now have an EXP system such as Call of Duty&#39;s, with each EXP point you get, you can buy armor and accessories. 

When assassinating other players if you hold down the melee button, you will do some time of cool move (such as jumping on the player, slashing their throat).

Elites are scaled bigger now, so they seem more realistic, and are twice the size of a Spartan.

New game types, very creative, and well done. Games such as: Elite vs Spartan, Headhunter, and a new capture the flag game (capture the flag with 3 flags, return to base, but you can steal the other teams flags per 60 seconds).

Jumping from high distances now hurts you.

Finally the game is a lot more tactical instead of the same old Halo approach of &quot;run&quot; and spray your gun.

[font=georgia][size=18pt][b]CONS[/b][/size][/font]

You die a lot more easily. (Yes, its bad when it comes to halo)

You still have a spawn time, when coming back from death.

Grenades are total BS. Grenades can kill you in one grenade (if standing on top of)

Getting &quot;beat down&quot; is a bit glitchy, you can hit someone from 2-5 feet if you repeatedly press the melee button. 

You still cannot aim your gun, and aim meaning you cannot look down the sight of the gun.

Guard mode isn&#39;t done very well, when you hit the ground people just wait and throw grenades under you, so when you done with the 3 seconds, you die. (Guard is hitting the ground and regaining your shield for 3 seconds, but you cannot move/shoot/hit)

[font=georgia][size=18pt][b]TO SUM IT UP[/b][/size][/font]

The game provides and excellent and tactical advantage depending on what you do, and when you do it. The game now provides different classes for things to get less boring, and for more things to master. The game has EXP rates, which with enough EXP you can buy new armor and attachments. The games guns are much stronger then any time before, for that being said, you die much quicker, and cannot take the old Halo approach, as of running around and spraying you Assault Rifle. But realize this is Beta, not the full game, so things can change, and most likely will.

In all ends I give this game a 8.5/10</description>
