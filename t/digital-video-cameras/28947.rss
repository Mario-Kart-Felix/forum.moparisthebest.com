    <title>Digital Video Camera&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/digital-video-cameras/28947</link>
    <description>I know nothing about digital video camera&#39;s, but they really dropped in price so I want to buy one. Also, not to be confused with a digital camera.

Like I said, I know nothing. I want a [i]decent[/i] one, under 500 dollars(otherwise my parents wont get me one for christmas). is there a reccommended brandname I should buy? Also should I be getting a certain kind of memory card? If someone could just walk me through what I should know before getting one, that&#39;d be great thanks.</description>

<p>Well i can help with the memory card.<br>

They come in sizes just like USBs like 128mb 256mb 512mb 1gig, and the price goes up when you get bigger ones obviously… every photo that i take with the digital camera i own is about just under 2mb…<br>
So depending on how many photos you want to take before you download them onto the computer, decide what size card… I myself got a 256mb card because the camera gets used on occasions like Christmas, but yeah pretty much just special occasions…</p>
