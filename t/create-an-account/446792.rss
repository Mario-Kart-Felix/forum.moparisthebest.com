    <description>alright, on my rsps website, i have a create an account button, and when you click it, it leads to no-where, So...i need some help with that. Also, how would you link the create an account on the website so that someone can just go onto the webclient and the account they created on the website is already created on the rsps itself. When it comes to the rsps side, i know almost everything but, in the website part of it im in the blank, and if this is in the wrong section my apologies but, can someone please help me develop the site. Ill try to find some sort of payment or something like that but, yea
