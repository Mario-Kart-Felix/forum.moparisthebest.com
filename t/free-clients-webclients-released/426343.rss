    <description>Hello, I have recently been working on a Runescape Private Server Webclient maker. I am 100% going to edit the site more and more every day. Rune-Wiki is a private server community and is evolving each and ever day. Finally after a few weeks I have created a Runescape Private Server Webclient Maker.

This webclient maker features:

Fully Working Premium Activation Codes


The site is at  :D  :D

This webclient maker will be offered as a script release within time. My scripts are edited by me, please give some credits to tobex because im almost 99% sure that is where the begining scripts came from. (I did some research and I guess someone hacked him and got some files from tobex) I dont really know the story, but anyway the scripts that I edited were most likely FROM tobex. 

I am also going to edit more of them as the time goes on. (for example add more tools that can be used)

As for if I release my scripts it will be on that site. Please come and enjoy the community as it is so far. Thanks

PS: Theme for the site that I used in pictures will be changed latter on and the ones that are in pictures are leached from chocotemplates.
