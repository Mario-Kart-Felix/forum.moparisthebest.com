If I had a choice and my own life I would not being doing that. Honestly I have no money, no car, nothing really because I am still just a kid. When I actually get a chance to do it I am going to. I also do learn alot of shit all the time. I hang out with my friends whenever I get a chance. I am not talking about some kid or something. Most people are starting to want to do nothing. Not young kids but adults. Lets use my brother as an example. All he does is go out with girls, fail at school, smoke pot, and drink. He is 19 years old. Right now he has nothing to go forward to. This is what people are starting to head towards.<br>

That’s like my brother. And we live in Australia. Except he is at his last year at school.<br>
He goes out with guys, is okay at school, smokes pot, and binge drinks. He is only 18. He has a little more to look forward to, but wait until he is 19 :P![/quote]</p>
<p>Notice the “is okay at school” part. My brother would rather do anything aslong as he does not have to learn how to do it.</p>

</aside>
<p>No Americans don’t have a good reputation regarding intelligence because people gave it to us. We invented the atomic bomb. We invented the Hydrogen bomb. We landed on the moon first. We helped out Britain’s ass in WWII. We probably have this reputation for being stupid because of the people who don’t care about anything other than entertainment. Right now over half of the American population does not give a shit about learning. They would rather sit on their ass and <span class="bbcode-b">stair</span> at a television instead of going out to learn, hang out, explore, etc.<br>

<p>No Americans don’t have a good reputation regarding intelligence because people gave it to us. We invented the atomic bomb. We invented the Hydrogen bomb. We landed on the moon first. We helped out Britain’s ass in WWII. We probably have this reputation for being stupid because of the people who don’t care about anything other than entertainment.
