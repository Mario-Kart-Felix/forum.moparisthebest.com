    <description>I just wanted to say the Development and show off section is on fire. I see lots of people working hard on there projects. I feel as if people are competing against eachother and are striving for greatness. This alone makes others want to do better, and is good for the learning process. Just wanted to say good job, and keep up the good work. If anyone has something motivational to share please do.</description>
