    <title>Looking for coder (Chaotic United)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-coder-chaotic-united/468950</link>
    <description>Hey guys I would like to introduce myself. I am funnystory and I am looking for a coder for my RSPS project. I am mainly looking for someone that can code a 317 with dungeenering and summoning and I have no problem if you want to use a base you downloaded off the internet as long as you are willing to do improvements to it and work hard on it, I personally see nothing wrong with that  :) . With all this being said I think it is extremely important that I get a coder that has good manners, is polite, and understands that to run a successful server you must be kind to the players. Unfortunately I have ran across many coders that are rude and arrogant. You do not gain anything from being mean on the internet as there is no point. Mainly I am just looking to acquire some friendly coders that want to run an RSPS for the enjoyment it brings :). Please contact me on my msn/skype:cowskull94@hotmail.com . I hope to hear from you guys soon!</description>

              <p>If you don’t have any experience being a programmer (ie. identifying and solving problems) or much experience working with OOP, then I would suggest not making, or joining a development team, and instead learn a bit more about the language. After you have a good foundation, then you would be more able to help solve problems in a development environment.</p>
<p>Also, the reason I closed the topic is because it’s not much of a team thread.</p>
