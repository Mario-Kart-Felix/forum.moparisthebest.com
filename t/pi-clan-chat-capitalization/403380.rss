Well, I&#39;ve tried so many different methods of trying to fix this, including help from fellow members of the community, but I just can&#39;t seem to get it. I&#39;ve tried modifying the client&#39;s &#39;clan chat&#39; packet 217. I&#39;ve tried editing all of my clan chat files to try and get some results, but nothing is working. Could someone PLEASE offer me any sort of assistance?</description>
