    <description>Skilling got 24 years for that Enron scandal. 

Article: http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=144422
&lt;blockquote&gt;OCT 24:  Jeffrey Skilling, Enron Corporation’s former CEO, was sentenced to 24 years and four months in prison and must forfeit $45 million for directing a massive fraud that destroyed the company and made its name synonymous with corporate wrongdoing.

US District Court judge Sim Lake sentenced Skilling Monday in Houston after seven victims described how the fraud upended their lives. Lake recommended that Skilling serve his term at a prison in Butner, North Carolina, while denying a prosecution request that he be jailed immediately. Skilling, 52, received the minimum sentence he faced under federal guidelines that suggest between 24 and 30 years.

“Skilling and his attorneys argue that the guideline range would be tantamount to life in prison,” the judge said after hearing a [b]defence[/b] request for a seven- to 10-year term. “But as the many victims of his crime have poignantly explained, his crimes have imposed on them a life sentence of poverty.”

Enron, once the seventh-biggest US company by sales, had a market value of more than $68 billion before its bankruptcy in December 2001 wiped out more than 5,000 jobs and at least $1 billion in retirement funds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
lol they spelt [b]defense[/b] wrong.

Serves that guy right for taking all of those peoples&#39; money. I think Skilling was the last one to get arrested in that big scandal. And out of that scandal, I think they were only able to recover 3 or 4 billion dollars when 52 billion dollars just disappeared! Can you believe it! They are probably in Swiss Bank accounts. :(</description>
