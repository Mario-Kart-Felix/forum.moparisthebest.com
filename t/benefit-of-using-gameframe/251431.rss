    <title>Benefit of using GameFrame?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/benefit-of-using-gameframe/251431</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m pretty new to RSC server emulation, but old to RS cheating (bovine labs, autorune, RSCN days), so sorry about the noob question.  

I was browsing through the Havokonline client source that I downloaded from these forums, and as far as I can tell this is how it&#39;s setup:

My question is: if it&#39;s displayed in a browser, what is the benefit of using GameFrame?  Or is this client&#39;s source setup to not be displayed in a browser?  It seems like what GameFrame is doing could easily be done by the GameWindow it&#39;s composed in.</description>

              <p>Yeah that might be true. But then it also might be made that way so that Jagex’s staff can run it via a client, and not in an Applet. If that is not the case either, I honestly don’t know. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

I am sure they made it so you can run it both as an Applet and as a java.awt.Frame so that people can run the client that they provided on their downloads-page (or wherever it is stored now).<br>

That client they had was basically just a web browser, with no navigation but <a href="http://runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">runescape.com</a>.<br>
it did still play through an applet i believe.[/quote]</p>
<p>Correct. I recall it vibrantly, exactly the same as the website, also, I do believe they even had in the description browser without all the clutter, no address abr and such. I’m also fairly certain it required you had internet explorer.</p>
