    <title>Helping with a Pali 508 Semi-Blank source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/helping-with-a-pali-508-semi-blank-source/353334</link>
    <description>Ok...I was working on coding a 317 but was just to much to do with client.java and kinda quit...

So i want to start with a &quot;kinda blank server&quot; it has all the stuff like Walking,emotes,clan chat, and kinda things you need to run it...

I was wondering if some one would be able to help me with adding...
Commands...(These are blank)
Adding Quest Tab Teles....(Blank Also..)
And Maybe adding some of the other skills...

To any one that helps thank you very much...
Please just don&#39;t flame..
Just need some help as i am a beginner coder..
Hope i gave enough Info about the server source to help...
THANK YOU</description>
