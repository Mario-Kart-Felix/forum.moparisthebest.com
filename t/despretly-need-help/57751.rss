    <description>Hey guys i&#39;m having some major trouble for ex.

1.) whenever i log on and play for about 10 min it all of a sudden says &quot;connection lost&quot; and kicks me out and wont let me log back in because it keeps on saying connection lost and kicks me

2.) i need some help with private servers if someone could give me a full explanation on how to play on someone elses server that&#39;d b good....
for ex. i see the ip the port, and the pass on a forum so i go to moparscape enter the new ip and enter the new port (under file) once i&#39;v done that i enter my username &amp; pw and it wont let me in (if u could tell me how to do it with &quot;poopscapepkz&quot; that&#39;d b really helpful thnx)

i know your thinking that im a waste of time and im so retarted and stuff but if you could help me i&#39;d be really thankful.
