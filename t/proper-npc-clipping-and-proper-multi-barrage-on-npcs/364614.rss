              <p>To make an NPC stop at a specified object, before walking through it, you’ll need to create an NPC-Clipping system. It should consist of a new package, and three created files. The first file, which should be the reader, should read all data from X and Y coordinates over specific objects. The second file, should load the reader, preparing it for the engine every time the server starts. The third file, which should be a .cfg file (Configuration file), should be stored somewhere where the reader can reach it and read off it correctly. It should contain X and Y, and H Coordinates that can’t be walked over by an NPC, which will prevent Noclipping over certain objects.</p>
<p>Multi-Barrage over NPCs can be created easily. If you have a Magic on NPC packet, then somewhere within that class create a code. The code should be begin something like this:</p>
<p><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 8045; i++) {
if (p.clickId == i) {
}
}</code></p>
<p>Place NPC projectiles, Animations, GFXs, Hits, an messages sent if a player doesn’t have the correct level to use this spell on. I’m not sure if the clickId variable is the correct one, but just replace it with whatever is used to tell which NPC the packet should attack on. Also, you may have to create some timers to add a more realistic effect on the NPC. Also, you’ll need to add an XP exchange over the code, so if the player has managed to hit the spell acuratley, he or she will recieve XP. For further effect, add some sounds to the spell.</p>
