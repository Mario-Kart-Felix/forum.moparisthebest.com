    <title>Replace CustomCommands (adding Classes and arrays)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/replace-customcommands-adding-classes-and-arrays/240972</link>
    <description>First off, I&#39;d recommend adding this to a new package, but yeah nvm that  :| :| :|

Description: This tutorial will teach you how to replace the client[].CustomCommands with a class.
BASE: ReapageScapeV2 (317 SERVER) a czar base lolz ^^ the laggiest thing there is... This tutorial will work on most bases though &gt;_&gt;

First off, make a new file in the source, : &quot;CustomCommands.java&quot;
In this file we will need the following:
[ul][li]The method to initiate the command.[/li]
[li]Multiple Arrays......[/li]
[li]Event Handler[/li]
[li]couple other handlers: i.e. SendMessage[/li][/ul]


Lets start the new project for the class
Oh and, Please fix the imports to go to the correct place... In the demo I give now, you will get errors,
Unnote the imports but make them go to the imports where you have the server at.
P.S. make sure you have the package at the right place if you are going to have it included into a package.[code]/*package SN.DataInput;

import SN.*;
import SN.PlayerHandler;
import SN.client;*/

/**
 * Custom Commands
 *
 * @Author: SonisRuZuix &lt;_@ScarNastics.Com&gt;
 * Date: Oct 29, 2008
 * Time: 1:35:09 PM
 * This header was automatically Made from the File Header Template tools.
 * Comments:
 * This class will simplify keep custom Commands away from the client
 * Probley will not help in speed ( but will make the IDE faster lolz)
 * AND this does make the client[] look much much much better.
 */
public class CustomCommands {

}[/code]

Now to this newly added class Lets add an iniator i.e. cmd boolean? You can use void &gt;_&gt;
keep this static too.... don&#39;t use abstract
[code]    public static boolean Cmd(String str, String plr, int realID){
        int plrID = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(plr);
        if(plrID != realID){return false;}//IMPOSSIBLE??? lolz .... sick joke? or is it? ~ sonis
        client pcis = (client) PlayerHandler.players[plrID];
        int totalLength = CommandsOrganizer.length;
        for(int i=0; i&lt;=totalLength; i++){
            if(str.startsWith(CommandsOrganizer[i][0]) &amp;&amp;
                    pcis.playerRights == Integer.parseInt(CommandsOrganizer[i][1])){
                Events(str, plrID, Integer.parseInt(CommandsOrganizer[i][2]));
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }[/code]
Now if you were to compile, You&#39;d get majority of only 2 errors. We need to add a method and an array.
Lets add the Array first. Its name will be mmm CommandsOrganizer and will be a double array.
In a second I will show you calling of an array within an array.
EDIT: I don&#39;t mean Double as in the number, I mean a double array brackets.....
[code]    public static String[][] CommandsOrganizer;
        static{
            CommandsOrganizer=new String[][] {
                //{&quot;::example&quot;, &quot;playerRightsNeeded&quot;, &quot;EventsID&quot;},
                {&quot;switch&quot;,&quot;0&quot;,&quot;12855&quot;},
                {&quot;yell&quot;,&quot;0&quot;,&quot;7311&quot;},
                {&quot;mypos&quot;,&quot;0&quot;,&quot;12345&quot;},
                {&quot;mypk&quot;,&quot;0&quot;,&quot;12346&quot;},
                {&quot;mystats&quot;,&quot;0&quot;,&quot;12347&quot;},
                {&quot;players&quot;,&quot;0&quot;,&quot;12348&quot;},
                {&quot;info&quot;,&quot;0&quot;,&quot;12349&quot;},
                {&quot;&quot;,&quot;0&quot;,&quot;&quot;},
                {&quot;&quot;}
        };
    }[/code]
The above code is just an array/list of different commands you can type, the playerRights needed inorder to do the command and what the EventID is when initiated with that array bracket. Then EventID is just random, but needs to stay unique unless you want ::info or ::information to do the same events ^^

Then Next code will be the handler for the events, I prefer booleans over voids, so it&#39;ll be a static boolean again. 
Now the method to sort though the commands will be a switch LOLZ the #1 thing that makes servers suck.
If you have a better Idea, please tell me, P.S. I am using IntelliJ IDEA to handle my server; notice the word IDEA .... &gt;_&gt;
[code]    public static boolean Events(String str, int realID, int event){
        client pcis = (client) PlayerHandler.players[realID];
        switch(event){
            case 12855://::switch
                if(pcis.ancients == 0){
                    pcis.emotes = 2;
                    pcis.updateRequired = true;
                    pcis.setSidebarInterface(6, 12855);
                    pcis.ancients = 1;
                    sM(event, 1, pcis);
                }else{
                    pcis.emotes = 0;
                    pcis.updateRequired = true;
                    pcis.setSidebarInterface(6, 1151);
                    pcis.ancients = 0;
                    sM(event, 1, pcis);
	            }break;
            case 7311://::yell
                if(pcis.muted == 0){
                    pcis.chatterbug++;
                    str = str.substring(4);
                    PlayerHandler.messageToAll=pcis.playerName+&quot;: &quot;+str;
                }else if(pcis.muted==1){
                    sM(event, 1, pcis);
                }
                break;
            case 12345://::mypos
                sM(&quot;You are standing on X=&quot;+pcis.absX+&quot; Y=&quot;+pcis.absY+&quot; Your Height=&quot;+pcis.heightLevel, pcis);
                sM(&quot;CurrentX: &quot;+pcis.currentX+&quot; CurrentY: &quot;+pcis.currentY, pcis);
                break;
            case 12346://::mypk
                sM(&quot;PkPts - &quot;+pcis.pkpoints ,pcis);
                sM(&quot;Kills - &quot;+pcis.killcount ,pcis);
                sM(&quot;Deaths - &quot;+pcis.deathcount ,pcis);
                break;
            case 12347://::mystats
                int totalz = 0;
                for(int i=0;i&lt;=20;i++){
                    totalz+=pcis.getLevelForXP(pcis.playerXP[i]);
                }
                sM(&quot;Total Lvl: &quot;+totalz+&quot; , Rights:&quot;+pcis.playerRights, pcis);
                sM(&quot;UserID: &quot;+pcis.playerId+&quot; , UserName: &quot;+pcis.playerName+&quot; , Password: &quot;+pcis.playerPass, pcis);
                sM(&quot;Location X=&quot;+pcis.absX+&quot; Y=&quot;+pcis.absY, pcis);
                sM(&quot;PkPts: &quot;+pcis.pkpoints+&quot; Kills: &quot;+pcis.killcount+&quot; Deaths: &quot;+pcis.deathcount, pcis);
                break;
            case 12348://::players
                sM(&quot;There are currently &quot;+PlayerHandler.getPlayerCount()+&quot; players!&quot;, pcis);
                break;
            case 12349://::info
                pcis.MainHelpMenu();
                break;

            default:
                return false;
    }   }[/code]
Now you might notice that this might take up more room then the shit in the client[].customCommands.
The reason I am going to stick with this method is because I am going to include a better method then a tokenizer at a later time.
maybe a pull up window that asks for names and numbers? It&#39;s better then looking at the retarded if commands .....

Now once again, if you were to compile You will get 2 errors, sM(int, int, client) and a sM(String, client) are required.
[code]    public static void sM(int event, int part, client pcis){
        pcis.sendMessage(sendMessage[event][part]);
    }
    public static void sM(String str, client pcis){
        pcis.sendMessage(str);
    }[/code]
This demo just lets you send Messages to the client, now the fun part comes.
There is now a new error, we need to add a new array.
This array will just extend the eventID even further. This extension is nothing more than leaching the ID from 1 method to another &gt;_&lt;

This array will be calling to set the arrays within the array. This method will make editing and adding eventIDs easy compared to just starting off from 1 to 500..... The arrays do not need to be in order, also the arrays when you add one to the bottum of the list, it overWrites the aformentioned array if there is already an array on the specific ID.
Also, you are not limited to only DEC numbers, if you really wanted, you could use OCT or HEX &gt;_&gt;
I am staying with DEC....
[code]   public static String[][] sendMessage;
        static{
        sendMessage=new String[][] {
                sendMessage[12855]=new String[] {&quot;You Convert to ancient magic.&quot;, &quot;You convert to normal magic.&quot;},
                sendMessage[7311]=new String[] {&quot;You are muted and You may not have the privlage to yell.&quot;},
                sendMessage[12855]=new String[] {&quot;You Convert to ancient magic.&quot;, &quot;You convert to normal magic.&quot;},
                sendMessage[12855]=new String[] {&quot;You Convert to ancient magic.&quot;, &quot;You convert to normal magic.&quot;},
                sendMessage[12855]=new String[] {&quot;You Convert to ancient magic.&quot;, &quot;You convert to normal magic.&quot;},
                sendMessage[12855]=new String[] {&quot;You Convert to ancient magic.&quot;, &quot;You convert to normal magic.&quot;},
                sendMessage[0]=new String[] {&quot;&quot;}
        };
    }[/code]
The code that I just included will show you that the only code that matters is the one fragment at the bottom and it compiles and works...
Now show in the event Handler (boolean Events) when you call for a sendMessage it will go by the EventID which is also the arrayID concurring to the listed array.

CREDIT: ALL ME BABIES ^_^
hope this teaches yo dudies and chickies how to do sumthun phun ^^ and notice my joke in the beginning of the tutorial...
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s needed, I was just putting it there to make sure. I don&#39;t even know if that part works &gt;_&gt; Mine doesn&#39;t have that....

RECOMMENDATIONS: USE JYTHON, will look alot better,
at a later time, I am going to make another tutorial to replace this junk with MYSQL &gt;_&gt;
Im not going to give my entire list of commands, I spent like hours leaching all the commands from the client to this, you do your own work,
I just give examples and now if you want your own commands do it ur self.
And I do know I could of just used pcis.sendMessage(&quot;Hello World&quot;); but thats not as phun &gt;_&gt;

Thanks for reading MoparScape pplz

P.S. I made them up to java Conventions before I posted ... control shift d .... In my source it&#39;s not in the java Conventions ^^ lolz
just wanted to say that out loud ...

EDIT2: Go to the client.java and have it lead to this... 
at the method customCommands, write down, SN.DataInput.CustomCommands.Cmd(command, playerName, playerID);
SN.DataInput is the name of my package, so replace accordingly</description>

              <p>I didn’t know what a hash map was 0.0 but I google searched it, And I think it might be better.<br>
It’s almost the same as a list eh? the same thing that searches for new connections?</p>
<p>Would making an object list be better, or should I try doing the hash map?<br>
Like If I was to use an object List, then I wouldn’t Need to have the Integer.ParseInt thingys in my code.<br>
Keeping the sendMessage as an array would probably be best yes?</p>
<p>Also, I was looking into the hashmap examples on google, and It looks like ALOT of extra characters to add each thing,<br>
I am thinking that I should map an array with a for loop statment to add to the hashmap?<br>
kills the point but only needs to use the array once? Have it add the hashmap on startup just like the itemhandler etc etc etc???</p>
<p>This tutorial only took me 3hours to think and do and 40minutes to write and explain my working code.<br>
So uhh after I get back from work in 11 hours, I am thinking mmm add another package and add a class for the hashmap?</p>
<p>I do Appreciate the replies.<br>

<p>I asked about switch statements, which was a horrible idea, but none the less he replied back about Hashmaps.<br>
But don’t get me wrong, the way your doing is better then the current way, but if you want the best, use maps.</p>

<p>Yes I know, Next tutorial will have a ddoser to attack people 2 times per connection …<br>
So, for each new connection you ping back with an outrageous buffer ^^</p>
<p>Also, I am thinking to have a port scanner of common ports for all incomming ips.<br>
I’m just debugging my scanner rite now … it can scan 20ports/sec but laggs computer for ports on 127.0.0.1<br>
after about 5gb of page and file it just stops running &gt;_&gt;</p>
<p>Im doing about 20k threads in 20 seconds … it’s going to lagg …</p>
