Yeah, you did read right, SwagPk is back, bigger then ever.
Still on the same database, with over 7000 registered users.
If you played SwagPk in the past, youd know about all our features, add-ons, events, and everything else. To start off im just gonna list some of the features:

Pk Points w/ highscores on site:

Clan System (chat and all that good stuff.) w/ highscores on site:

Xplock:

Afk Room JUST like the original server stork ran:

Some others:
Events like capture the skull w/event points+highscores, Lottery, referral system, cash cert system, K/D Ratio w/ highscores, Control Panel on site showing referrals and all that good stuff, our original swagpk global messages when player gets pked (shows clan names be4 names), xprate cmd for creating low lvls, thieving areas, afk room just like the ORIGINAL storkpk, quests, some tweaks to the friends system, swagbox!!! automatically fills ur inv with food when that command is done, premium areas, and much MUCH more. Also, blue name + 1.4x xp rate for donators.

Whoever played this server can honestly tell you, we are filled with original features which make the server fun as shit and make pvp 10x funner then anywhere else. This server has everything and its 1 of a kind, swagpk is known for its unique-ness if thats even a word.

The site link is in my sig, 


Delete the other topic, this ones official.</description>
