    <description>Remove any thing if asked 


[center]Some stuff in here you mite like, its not all about me.[/center]

Right i have about 350 Commands from Teleporting Additems Main system command ect, and i would like to places them in there own *.java file (Commands.java) but theres so menny things that customcommand needs. 

so how would i go about doing this? :|

thansk for your time =[) 

Can some one help me, when i click objects (any object First click or any other..) i get no respons and if i stand at the objects X and Y i get disconnected why is this and how can i fix this problem.

when adding more if staments i get an error saying
[code]
client.java:21114: code too large
        public void parseIncomingPackets(){
                    ^
Note: stream.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.
1 error
SoulScape v5.0 is online, on port 43594.

[/code]

And before you say you have an error on bla bla line.. in client.java, i can read an error report!
it is not the coding that is giving me the error just the size..


I would also like the Real Runescape Welcome screen

[IMG]http://i143.photobucket.com/albums/r148/littleplop/Screenshotwelcomescreen.jpg[/img]

Im using this code to get it to show on log in,
[code]
showInterface(15244);
[/code]
That is the interface ID for the welcome screen!!!!!! 

Is there any way i can get this to show over the screen i think java TM can do it, also when loging in with a 377 cache client the frames are not the same as using an older cache (not sure items are up to anger weapons)  

Dont worry about the castle wars in there as well, thats just because i was there at the time..

Some one mite want this
[code]
sendQuest(&quot;Welcome to SoulScape - Use the buttons below to design your player&quot;, 3649);//Char window
[/code]

And this this is the Prayer : 0/0 frame on the Prayer interface (Adding this will let it drain as you use your prayer.)
[code]
sendQuest(&quot;Prayer: &quot;+playerLevel[5]+&quot;/&quot;+getLevelForXP(playerXP[5])+&quot;&quot;, 687);//Prayer frame
[/code]

Well, it cannot be fixed, unless you find the actual frame for it, that one is bugged or glitched, try finding another frame that is alike</p>
