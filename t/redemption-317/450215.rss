<p>Wtf? Obviously its a pi but you do not specifically know which Pi?! I cannot believe you just said its a pi, well naw captain obvious?! Thats like saying private servers are based of runescape, you had the cheek to call me ignorant after that statement l0l.<br>
I haven’t even looked at the source, I just know your previous statement was completely retarded as YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT BASE HE IS USING.  You know the base he is using is based of pi but that is not the base. Moron.<br>

No matter what you say it’s still a PI. No matter who fucked it up after him, the BASE is still Project Insanity.<br>
Saying he based it off PI, is like saying he created his own base, using PI as a reference, which is completely wrong. Saying this base isn’t PI is like saying you weren’t a mistake, its just not true.[/quote]<br>
Dear god, I’m not going to debate with a retard. Whatever you say dumbo(y)</p>

Giving credits to JaGeX and the private server base is pathetic. Everyone knows they get credits, no need to mention it. Stop complaining.</p>
