    <title>Very Simple questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/very-simple-questions/347013</link>
    <description>Haha, try not to laugh to hard at this question, but ok, here goes.

How do I let people donate to my server?
Once they&#39;ve donated, how do I give them a donator sign?
How would they get donator points for donator shops?

Thanks :p</description>

              <p>Ok, donar sign isnt “on the server” by default.<br>
Most blurrs clients w/ a delta servers have the icon, but it is not controlled via server side, but on the client side, were sprites are handled.</p>
<p>Ill assume this is delta, so first when they donate, let them donate, paypal, or whatever it is you do, then you need to make sure your server has a character token for donators, most deltas have this, check any players txt file to see something like donator = 0, next you need a command if your not going to do it manually, just use the search button, you WILL find one, dont come back saying you wont, (Search in the help section so you get results ONLY from the help section)</p>
<p>You would also need to make donator points a token too i guess, so you would need it something like “Givedt50” to user, and a command for the players to check how many tokens they have, something like this:</p>
<p><code>if command.equals("checkdt") {
sM("You have +   donatortokens     + donator tokens!");
}
</code><br>
You get the idea right?</p>
<p>The part in the message it sends to the player to see how many donator points they have may be wrong, i think it goes something like this:</p>
<p>+(tab)<a>CharTokenname</a>+</p>
<p>Havent done delta in a while, wouldnt remember, moving on to hyperion, but just refer to a command similar to this in your source so you would get the idea.</p>

              <p>theres also many things to consider giving donors, sure giving them the ability to buy money/items, or what. but also when you make it so donors get to buy items, they will rise in price dramaticly, then normal players have to work harder then runescape to get a whip or something…but you get the point…</p>
<p>I kinda like playing on servers where you donate. and you get donate status only, and in the shop there is items, but they arent donor only…they are just a wee bit hard to get… Think it through man…<img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
