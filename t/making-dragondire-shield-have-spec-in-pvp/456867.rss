    <title>Making DragonDire Shield have spec in pvp?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-dragondire-shield-have-spec-in-pvp/456867</link>
    <description>You know when you equip dragonfire shield and fight an npc?

The dragonfire shield will do random specs, its like a vengence and hit the npc with an extra 20 damage.

I took the same code out of attacknpc and put it into the special area for like 5698: dragon dagger and put the same gfx&#39;s and anims in there.

I have a 317 delta source, if anyone could help me figure this out, it doesnt work while attacking players. Thanks!</description>

              <p>Well you’ve used a dragonfire shield before right? After a couple hits, you do a special attack out of random, no clicking of anything. The shield does it for npc’s on my server, but not on people, and i took the npc special i found that was the code and copied that put a new code in for specials under 5698 in client.java. the special bar is not wat i need, thanks for helping tho <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>I suppose if you wanted it to spec like a dragon dagger (which is really weird and probably not at all what you want), you’d make the DFS a weapon and give it a special bar. Because the special attacks will only activate if you press the special bar button (unless you change it). That would make it equip in the weapon slot and act like a weapon, so that would be a horrible idea.</p>
<p>You could probably find another button to activate it (put it in clickingbuttons or something), or even a command. So just make the button case do the emote, gfx, and do damage, or the same for the command. Or better yet, since it’s a 317 server, don’t use custom items or load higher revisions.</p>
