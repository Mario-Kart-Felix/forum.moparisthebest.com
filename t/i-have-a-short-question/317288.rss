    <title>I have a short question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-a-short-question/317288</link>
    <description>Does this have anything to do with..Okay let me explain, when a person tries to log on with one IP twice and they log in almost at the same time could I change anything in this to make it to where after about 3 logins a few moments apart it bans the host.
And what would I have to change if this does have anything to do with what is said above.
[code]	public void banHost(String host, int num) {
		if (false) {
			banned.add(host);
		} else {
			try {
				misc.println(&quot;BANNING HOST &quot; + host + &quot; (flooding)&quot;);
				banned.add(host);
				delay = 2000;
				delayUpdate = System.currentTimeMillis() + 60000;
			} catch (Exception e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}

	}[/code]
