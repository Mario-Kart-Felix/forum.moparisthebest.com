    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-know-what-i-did-wrong/227679</link>
    <description>Well I was moving some shops around and editing some of them and after I compiled I tried to run the server and got this:

[code]PyroScape
 ..  Online!
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: &quot;
          &quot;
        at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(Unknown Source)
        at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Unknown Source)
        at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Unknown Source)
        at ShopHandler.loadShops(ShopHandler.java:117)
        at ShopHandler.&lt;init&gt;(ShopHandler.java:30)
        at server.main(server.java:35)
[/code]
