    <title>So I heard you like boss fights?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-i-heard-you-like-boss-fights/539905</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve been working on this little thing...

And as I finished making this guy, I thought I should show the outside world what I&#39;ve been doing :D let me know what you guys think!

P.S. Animations will be fixed once I start polishing things... at the moment I&#39;m just dealing with the meat of things.</description>

<p>o.0…<br>
Old demons… ah yes, old demons look(ed) too… plain… yes.</p>
<p>I remember the new ones now… I didn’t like how they had one foot in front of the other XD it was weird.<br>
By the way, the animations (that were missing in this video) are now all in (for every NPC), which is great! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Anyhow!</p>
<p>On another note! I will open the server for testing in a few minutes (just gotta spawn karamja and add transport methods to get there) :3 To see what people think and gather some feedback!</p>

<p>Now that’s pretty cool! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> I will definitely do something like that…<br>
Or like summoning imps in random locations near the player, making them pulse area damage, making the player kill them or move the boss (this would also account for parties of people fighting chronozon)</p>
