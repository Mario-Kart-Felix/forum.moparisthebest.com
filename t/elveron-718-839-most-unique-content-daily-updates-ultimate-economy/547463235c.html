<p>I apologize my absence for the afternoon/night. I have 5 midyears and 4 projects this week, and I need to get ahead of my game so that I am not suffering. So, the last half of the day was consumed with school work and then tomorrow may be busy as well.</p>
<p>However good news, two actually. First of all, Stealing Creations beta v2 occurred today and it is absolutely fun. Most of the bugs from the first beta were patched and the game is running ALOT more smoothly (can still be tested by donators). I just have a few more things to fix and finish then it will be released to the public.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am very happy to have heard from <a class="mention" href="../../u/chloe.html">@Chloe</a> today, and since things started to smooth out for him, Chloe is now returning to the Elveron team. Many people may not know who Chloe is because he had to leave quite a while a go, more than a month ago due to events in real life that Chloe didn’t want to effect the server. We thought that was the last we would see of Chloe on Elveron, however I was so excited to hear back today. Chloe has EXTREMELY helped us with the stability of our server in the past and has successfully kept Elveron up and running. Now what was Chloe’s job? Chloe was our first and only technician of the server. Chloe did any technical tasks such as maintaining hardware on the Dedicated Server, guiding me through the process of converting our server environment from Windows to Linux, properly allocating our resources and network for smoother performances, fixing issues with the server including solving nulls and such when I am not available, etc. Chloe does a lot and was immensly recognized for his work when he was around and we will get started tomorrow when I wake up and have another chat with him.</p>
<p>1/9-10/15</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a null pointer with ground items</li>
<li>Players that could not create Iron Man mode accounts can now properly.</li>
<li>Iron Man NPC drops no longer stick to the ground forever.</li>

<p>HUGE shoutout to help from Brennen (taht one guy) for the MAJOR help on making this minigame possible.

<ul>
<li>Touched up Master Capes and the requirements.</li>
<li>Fixed up the permissions for Donator pets.</li>
<li>Improved charge handling for Sacred Clay and Volatile tools.</li>

        <p>Due to the fact that I have been extremely busy on weekdays due to school and sports, barely having time to code, I have made a desicion with King Fox. It has been very stressful for me to squeeze in updates on my busy weekdays every single day, usually late at night. And with the size of our server, it is overwhelming to keep up with the flow of requests coming in each day. Therefore, we have added an addition to our development team: <span class="mention">@taht</span> one guy .</p>
<p>This individual I have known for a quite a while and I have a lot of trust in him which he has earned over a long time. He is very talented and has a vast knowledge of RuneScape, putting lot’s of detail into the content he produces. Brennen is also very meticulous with his content and thoroughly tests things before putting them into the live server, producing very high quality and efficient content. He also has experience running servers from the past and knows how to interact with the community and pull in ideas/suggestions/bugs that are important and will work hard to improve Elveron. He is the guy who has MAJORLY helped in our development of Stealing Creations and has amazed me with everything he has done in the past. This will not only progress Elveron further to being one of the most advanced servers out there, but will also make the server more enjoyable and relieve the stress from both King Fox and I.</p>
<p>Introduce yourselves to him <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> There is a lot to come this weekend, however I do bid warning:</p>
<p>I will be gone half of Saturday due to community service and all of Sunday because IT IS MY BIRTHDAY :DDDDD</p>
<p>1/16/15</p>
<ul>
<li>Completed Stealing Creations Mystic dialogue.</li>
<li>Fixed Stealing Creations bubble null problem.</li>
<li>Made Barrier attacking an action in Stealing Creation.</li>
<li>Completed Stealing Creation Kiln interface options.</li>

        <p>So in today’s update post, we will be looking into a future update that has been started a while ago but we are announcing today. Jordan has been helping us make a major move that is going to take us between 1-2 weeks to complete. We are converting the base from 718 to 742.</p>
<p>I thought we were already 742?<br>
No, we are currently 718 loading some aspects of 742. We are switching to a pure 742 cache and client. A lot of the issues we are having are caused by the 718 loading xxx, because it isn’t packed properly, it is incomplete, the data jumps from different revisions, and it is just one mess. Now we were thinking of just properly packing 742 stuff into the 718 cache, however it would be overall better to stick to a pure cache rather than loading other revision onto it.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of a pure 742?<br>
Well, we are going to have all the features of a 742 cache, not just items and a few maps. Not only this, but using a pure cache will solve many of our problems such as crashing in many maps such as Seer’s Village, Rimmington, Al Kharid Mine, etc. It will also fix a ton of the buggy weapons, messed up models, broken interfaces, etc. The new 742 client is also very memory efficient, the display modes are no where near as buggy as the current ones, mac users will be able to run the client more smoothly, and so much more. There are so many benefits of using a pure cache and not loading bs onto it, I just can’t list them all tonight since I’m stressed with work xD</p>
<p>Why will it take 1-2 weeks?<br>
There is a lot of work to be done. The way the cache loads and is read will need to be changed, packets will need to be rewritten, we will have to update the handshake server, we will need to find new packets, etc. We are also rewriting the networking to support pipelines and multi threads (which Matrix never did for some reason?) to make connections more stable and majorly reduce disconnections. Our netty will be updated to a newer and more secure version. A lot of cores will be rewritten to make the server a lot more stable. This goes beyond just upgrading our revision, it is making Elveron more stable and powerful.</p>
<p>Why the revision 742?<br>
It includes a lot of things that I love such as the new maps (yes, our current cache has half of the 742 maps since its incomplete), it has a lot of the items I really like in it, it is very stable compared to other revisions, the interfaces are very clean, it includes awesome features like JAG, and a major that can be summed up in a picture.</p>

        <p>Well first off, I have to quash the rumors that have been going around. Some people misinterpreted my post last night, thinking that we are adding in EoC. We are NEVER going to add EoC (our advertisements do say Pre-EoC server). What I was trying to explain last night was that we are upgrading to the revision BEFORE EoC. Meaning our content will be the latest version before EoC went live (which was 743). So you all can stop worrying now xD</p>
<p>Now I want to introduce <span class="mention">@_Jordan</span> . I did a poor job of introducing Jordan last night because I have not been having a good week, which has shown in my performance. Nethertheless he deserves an introduction as he is part of one of our most major updates to come soon. So, Jordan is not a random. He actually did work with me for a while a bit over a year ago on Rage-Scape. At the time, it was a project and wasn’t really advertised, and I was a very novice coder so I was just tagging along with Jordan. Now we didn’t stop developing together because of a conflict, he worked great on the team, rather it was at that time that I had little dedication and I just couldn’t support Rage-Scape and became very inactive. Anyways moving away from the past, Jordan is a very experienced and renowned coder that has produced amazing framework which many servers use today, has a very expansive knowledge of java, has great ideas and clean coding, and works with the development team very well. We originally were not planning on having Jordan develop with us, but he was working on this upgrade at such a fast pace and has shown just stunning ability, that we eventually discussed and once this is complete Jordan will be developing full time with us.</p>
<p>Lastly, I don’t have bullet points for today because there was a lot of work on this upgrade done, the new tournament minigame, and a major discussion with the staff team on our roster and performance so that we can improve in the next upcoming days. That is all for now, good night!</p>
