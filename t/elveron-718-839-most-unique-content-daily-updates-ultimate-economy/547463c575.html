<p>Merry Christmas Elveron! Terribly sorry I couldn’t make it on today, I had Christmas shopping to do, mass tp attend, preparing for tomorrow’s feast, etc. and things have been very busy today. I will be very busy tomorrow due to it being Christmas and I need some time to relax and relieve the stress that I have had recently. So I just wanted to give a heads up that I will probably not be online tomorrow.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I was able to get the Christmas event done today which can be started at home by speaking to Santa. I am dedicated aren’t I?</p>
<p>12/24/14</p>
<ul>
<li>New Christmas Event that can be found at home (Dec 25 - Dec 31).</li>
<li>An awesome and semi lengthly quest with the event.</li>
<li>Many dialogues created for this event.</li>
<li>The event is spread out all over the map and you will have to do exploring.</li>
<li>Added an activity unlocked after helping santa with his quest.</li>
<li>Added an awesome rewards shop that contains exclusive items that will be discontinued after the event.</li>
<li>Both Combat and Skilling activities are available in the after quest activity.</li>
<li>Added awesome effects of the snowball generating snow on the ground.</li>
<li>Snow can be picked up from the piles you find.</li>
<li>Snowballs can be properly thrown at people (WOOOHOOOOOOOOOOO).</li>
</ul>

        <p>Well, today was an extremely day for me. I was finishing my college applications, and MIT having a ton of supplementals and these non common app ones are killing me. But, I spent a good amount of hours on them today and I am about 90% done with them, I will continue tomorrow. So, as I announced this morning on the server, that was the schedule for me.</p>
<p>I will not be posting the updates today as I want to do them in a batch tomorrow, since most of my day was consumed by getting my applications ready.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>I have a sneak preview that I may have alluded to on Christmas Eve and earlier for the staff team…</p>
<p>Coming soon to Elveron… (Monday I hope)</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UPMSpxx.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Server <span class="hashtag">#3-5</span> to have Stealing Creations?<br>
Huge shout out to Brennen for making SIGNIFICANT progress in Stealing Creations for Elveron with us.<br>
There is still a lot more to be done, bugs to be fixed, testing to do, content to finish.<br>
However, Stealing Creations currently stands at 80% complete, including map generating (sizes depending on team sizes) with random locations each time - evenly spread out amongst classes and activities.</p>

        <p>Had a great day with my friends, finally got some real relaxing done. It is vacation, I have been working very hard on college applications and school, the server, sports, etc. that I just need some time to relax this vacation, and I hope that the players agree that I well deserve it.</p>
<p>Stealing Creations? Oh it is going well, and it may be at the same point right now as the other servers that have it, but it is still not complete. However, I will open up BETA access to the minigame tomorrow to a select few people. If you are interested in beta testing it and finding bugs, please message me.</p>
<p>Lastly, I got home a bit late but I was able to get a bunch of those naggy bugs done that have been a pain in the ass. Some small, some large, some just suggestions. I did the ones that didn’t take me too long, here we go <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Actually. One more thing, please suggest some things on our new content thread (VERY IMPORTANT) or atleast read it: <a href="http://elveron.org/community/index.php?/topic/2458-end-game-content/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://elveron.org/community/index.php?/topic/2458-end-game-content/</a></p>

        <p>First things first, I saw the Hobbit today and thought it was amazing, although it was a bit too much centered on one battle which kind of irritated me. Anyways, noticed that the dwarf cannon issues were really lagging the server and eating an enourmous amount of memory, so decided to patch that bug. But while I was at it, I worked more on improving general things about the dwarf cannon.</p>
<p>I am sorry to inform you guys, but Stealing Creations may be a bit delayed for beta testing. I still have some multiplayer issues to sort out with it. I hope it will be ready soon and have considered everyone who has requested beta access.</p>
<p>12/28/14<br>
-Cannons now properly dissappear upon logging back in.<br>
-They also properly go into your inventory.<br>
-The cannon should no longer hit any pets or familiars.<br>
-Cannons should no longer multi shoot a npc five times in one fire.<br>
-You can no longer noclip with cannon placement.<br>
-Fight Kiln crystals can only be used in Fight Kiln.<br>
-Improved some issues with Trading and declines.<br>
-Spent the day looking at trade bugs and possible dupes, think I nailed them all.<br>
-Addressed the issue with Dungeoneering and no movement.<br>
-Trades are now efficiently logged with acceptances, declines, lent items, etc.</p>

        <p>Starting to take more personal time off, just to relax and stuff. This is not permanent, it is just till January that I am not as active as I usually am. I have been working on the server, day by day, non stop for literally many many hours each day. I have not missed a day, even during Thanksgiving break, etc. I have decided it is best for my health to just relax and enjoy winter vacation due to all of the effort I have been putting into the server. I am still getting stuff done, however it is not the maximum and I will not be ingame that much until January 1st. I am just giving myself time to recooperate, time to get my applications submitted by January 1st, and some recreation time. I just wanted to give everyone a heads up and hope you guys understand!</p>
<p>12/29/14<br>

        <p>Long day o.O Woke up early to elite hax0rs on the server causing mayhem. Worked vigerously to spot and patch the exploits, but I think it is good. Going to be busy since it is New Years Eve (oh my, still got applications due tomorrow night), cooking a great meal since it is probably one of my last New Year’s Eves with my family in a while. Stealing Creations to come soon, I know you guys are eager <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>Happy New Years to everyone on behalf of the staff team! I hope everyone has had a wonderful year as Elveron has had a great one. I finished applying to most of my colleges and now I can truely relax. Just a friendly reminder that votes reset today. We need to take advantage and vote like crazy so that we can maintain our spots at the top. For that reason, I have turned double vote rewards on. Enjoy!</p>
<p>On a last note, Stealing Creations is now active for BETA! Please understand that this is a beta and it will not be flawless. We need your help to find and patch bugs, and there will probably be many. There is no rewards shop yet and you can access the beta in Gamer’s Grotto. The people who PM’d me prior to this asking for beta access will have beta access along with any donator. Please report bugs to me in the form of a PM.</p>

<p>Again, Happy New Years everyone! Had a great day of rest, relaxation, applied to most of my colleges, had fun times on teamspeak with the community (yes we even had <a class="mention" href="../../u/rockon.html">@Rockon</a> 's favorite flute). Also, we were able to test out Stealing Creations with around 10 players with beta access and it worked out well. Sure we have bugs to quash that we found today, but all is going well and I am really excited.</p>
<p>The community has been speaking about the donator revamp, and it is something that just had to happen. So, I worked on it today before I forgot about it. Fixed up some non working features, added in some promised features, etc. Note that the Supreme/Angelic/Demonic zones are still under construction as I am collaborating on ideas with other people.</p>
<p>1/1/2015<br>
-Added ::rules which links to the rules forum post.<br>
-The Kalphite Queen and Giant Mole are now Assassin tasks.<br>
-Regular, Extreme, and Legendary Donators receive their Donator Capes upon auto donation.<br>
-Donator tokens and gear now go into your bank rather than your inventory.<br>
-All the Donator Capes are now in the respected Donator Shop.<br>
-Updated the Regular Donator shop with new items.<br>
-The Extreme Donator shop has been added back to the Donator Zone.<br>
-Added in the donator Squeal of Fortune chances.<br>
-Supreme Harmony and Divine Armor are now in the Divine Donator Shop.<br>
-Mr. Ex is now in the Divine Donator Zone.<br>
-Added in an Angelic Donator Zone with a new Angelic Donator Shop.<br>
-Angelic and Supreme Donator Zones still under construction, throw me ideas.<br>
-Mackers can no longer be exploited for penguin points.<br>
-Pest/Jad can no longer be wave-skipped using a specific exploit.<br>
-Fixed SOF Tab not being present when dismissing a familiar.</p>

        <p>Slow day because I have been doing my winter break’s homework today o.o I also got a haircut and look sweg. Anyways, now that break is over we are starting to see a comeback. Hopefully soon we will be averaging 100 :3 Let’s go Elveron!</p>
<p>Also on another important note, <span class="mention">@Deansta</span> has a lovely client he has been working on that we have tweaked to be compatible with Elveron. It is up for beta and everyone is free to try it. Please report back on it’s performance (CPU Useage, Crashes, Improvements, etc.) to both myself and Deansta. You can find the download link here: <a href="http://www.elveron.org/beta2.jar" rel="nofollow noopener">www.elveron.org/beta2.jar</a></p>

        <p>Hello everyone, many of you are aware of the thread recently for suggestions of different roles for the server. The staff team has read the suggestions and are debating the new roles that will come out. We are still taking suggestions of course, and we will notify you when we know which spots will be open.</p>
<p>Now, a very exciting and new important part. I realized that a lot of the staffs time is wasted with being pummeled with questions that don’t require staff assistance, so many to the point where it gets overwhelming to do the job. Now, staff are there to handle the things that regular players do not have the power to assist. However, people are still left with questions and tips.</p>
<p>There are special players, veterans, that have been playing the server for quite a while and have a vast knowledge of the server. Even these members can answer most of the questions that staff get pounded with and I have seen it in the friends chat. So, why not make it convenient to lend the veterans a helping hand?</p>
<p>We are going to be implementing a live support system tomorrow (similar to the ones you find on gold websites and larger servers) in which players will be able to get support from some of our wisest members whether it be help with client issues, advice on how to train a skill, questions on how to reach an area, how to obtain a certain item, etc. This will allow the staff to do their jobs with more efficiency and will satisfy the needs of the player.</p>
<p>What will be included with this live support system:<br>
-Implementation on every page of the website in a little tab at the bottom right of the page.<br>
-A list of the operators that are currently available to assist.<br>
-Different departments if there are players that specialize in areas.<br>
-Ability to identify players that need assistance with fields for ingame names, main question, etc.<br>
-A mobile friendly support chat for people on their devices.<br>
-Transfering of clients to staff members if the issue needs to be escalated.<br>
-Logs of chats available to staff members and ability to ban for abuse.<br>
-Ability to open the chat in your browser by clicking a button ingame.<br>
-Operators will not need to have a window open 24-7, the software provides a tray notification and noise when someone requests assistance.<br>
-Giant control panel for operators and a beautiful interface to ease assistance.<br>
-Mobile app for Apple and Android devices for operators to assist players from the comfort of their devices.<br>
-Ability for operators to set accurate availability statuses.<br>
-Automated responses to frequently asked questions (such as: How do I make money? What is the download link? How do I train Summoning?)<br>
-Abiliity to rate operators which will help us determine who is fit for the job.</p>
<p>Now, we are looking for a total of 8 operators. We want this service to be 24-7, so we will need a team of active players who love to help. I have already received requests to join this when I simply mentioned the idea in the post, so I suggest PM’ing me on the forums ASAP. You will need to use the following format:<br>
Ingame Name:<br>
Daily Time Spent Ingame:<br>
Time Length Playing the Server:<br>
Knowledge of the Server:<br>
Explain Your Ability to Assist Players:<br>
Do You Have a Mobile Device? If so, which one:<br>
What Timezone and Hours Can You Be an Operator:</p>
<p>Operators do not have to be veterans, as long as they have a vast knowledge of the server. They will receive a special rank on the forums and will stand out ingame. I will also reward them if they work dilegently and receive great feedback.</p>
<p>Now, here are today’s updates:</p>
<p>1/5/15</p>
<ul>
<li>Finished Boss Kill Count interface, its ready to rock n’ roll.</li>
<li>Progress tracking for all of the main bosses of the server, as we add more we will expand this.</li>
<li>Soon to come rewards for having high counts :3</li>
<li>Added option for the Boss Kill Count (BKC) to account options on the quest tab.</li>
<li>New support system mentioned above.</li>
<li>Highscores are back online, administrators should be removed.</li>
</ul>

        <p>Today is the first day of our support team revamp and I am very excited. We have gotten many things set up and prepared for the beginning of a strong team that can take Elveron far.</p>
<p>First up, our staff organization has been majorly improved. Like any other staff team, we are not perfect and we realize that there are faults. However we are here to correct them and we have developed more strict guidelines and standards in order to keep ourselves on top of our game. <a class="mention" href="../../u/light.html">@Light</a> will be returning to the staff team as the Staff Manager. What will he be doing? He will be logging staff activity (literally to the minute), monitoring corruption, observing interactions with the community, making sure that staff are doing their jobs, checking in with their real life statuses, etc. On top of that, we have cleaned out the staff chat and have only affiliated it with our existing team so that there are no cross communications and less of a tumult. Next, we have come up with a more organized fashion of dealing with things. We are now using Google Drive to organize everything from logging punishments to discussing possible staff promotions. Through Google Docs, we are able to have a news board for the staff and categorize the different branches and restrict access to the different ranks. We can access and even edit these from our mobile devices, any computers, etc. and are able to share files and important documents easily. The punishment system will be a lot more organized now that we can log all of our punishments with the punisher, offender, time dealt, punishment length, and reason. Not only that but staff can comment on the punishments and discuss appeals privately. We also are able to discuss important topics as a team such as our new rewriting of the official rules which will be out this weekend. This also makes applications a lot easier as the staff can discuss individual players, provide insight analysis on our possible promotions, etc. From this point on, everything we do should be a lot more organized and less cluttered, ultimately leading to less stress for both the staff and players.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TDtReqW.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Secondly, we now have a brand new Event Manager <span class="mention">@Philelelele</span> who will be training with myself and <a class="mention" href="../../u/light.html">@Light</a> for his first event on Friday. Why aren’t his events starting now? Because we are still testing his ability and teaching him the basics needed for this role. We have decided to chose Philelele because of his active participation in the community and his leadership skills. We have personally watched him organize events and activities along wiith guiding players without us asking him to. I believe that he has the skill set to bring together the community and make the server a lot more fun. Both Light and I have been watching Philelelele create his schedule for his first week of events as well as reward suggestions and they have proved to be well balanced and unique, with some events I’ve never heard of but sound extremely fun. Not only that, but he has gone above and beyond and prepared nearly two weeks of events along with schedule changes incase Stealing Creations comes out early. Because we are still training him, the events have not been approved yet. However the events should be approved by Thursday and will be posted along with dates and times on the forums in Philelele’s brand new section of the forums dedicated to his events. Get ready for the daily community events in which was used to have so much participation begin to return <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> This will hugely benefit the server and bring the players together.</p>
<p>Third, we now have a brand new Marketing Manager <a class="mention" href="../../u/millenium.html">@Millenium</a> who will be helping us with advertising, communicating with the players, coordinating the development team, and everything else that falls into the category. This rank is still in development as it is a relatively new thing, but we know what good marketing has done for Elveron so far. It is important that we have every part of the team necessary and I am glad for Millenium to be on our side helping us soar past our goals. Hopefully we can dig ourselves out of this hole very soon.</p>
<p>Lastly, our Live Support system is online! I would like to congratulate the following members who will be our official operators: <a class="mention" href="../../u/satanic.html">@Satanic</a> , <span class="mention">@Charity</span> , <span class="mention">@deansta</span> , <span class="mention">@kingjosh484</span> , <a class="mention" href="../../u/yuze.html">@yuze</a> , and <a class="mention" href="../../u/lolfail.html">@lolfail</a> . This team of experienced players have impressed me for quite a while with their knowledge of the game and willingness to help the community out. They all have ridiculous hours of dedication and what makes this team unique is that they are all spread out. We have operators on both coasts of the United States, operators in New Zealand and Australia, and an operator in England (and possibly another tomorrow in Holland). Players can access the live chat from any part of our website or by typing the command ::livechat ingame. They have yet failed to impress me as I have already seen lot’s of positive feedback in the chat transcriptions. Myself and <a class="mention" href="../../u/light.html">@Light</a> have also been testing them undercover throughout the day and have been receivinig responses in 1-3 seconds, one time in less than a second all at different times and it was just mind blowing. Hopefully they keep up this rapid and helpful support as it has already proven in a few hours to help players.</p>
<p>Also, since admins are more in demand now, we will have an administrator promotion this weekend. That also means two moderator promotions. Which also means two support promotions. So make sure those applications are submitted (foreshadowing).</p>
<p>On another note, the highscores should be functioning well once again.</p>

        <p>Light has been demoted due to extreme immaturity and corruption thanks to the influence of Justin. Anyways, enough is enough and I will no longer put up with bad staff members. Light was once good, but things have changed and he along messed up the forums which should be organized up by the morning.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, I am getting excited to approve and release the event list for Phil tomorrow along with a new and improved official rules list.</p>
<p>Also due to increasing demand, I will be adding in the Iron Man Mode into the game tomorrow and white portal should be up again tomorrow as well <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Lastly, I have no school tomorrow because the weather will be in the negatives. So, I will see you guys on teamspeak tomorrow and ingame :3</p>

        <p>Today was a rough day, did not get as much accomplished as I wanted to. Where do I start?</p>
<p>Well first of all, you may have all noticed that our forums is fresh to a new start. This is because Light and Justin were able to use hidden accounts and destroy the forums. We were able to recover data, however it was time that we started fresh on the forums. So we started this off by purchasing a legitimate IPBoard lisence so that we are running off of official software and have access to all of the hooks and downloads we need to make our forums awesome. <span class="mention">@5ive</span> and <a class="mention" href="../../u/shadow.html">@Shadow</a> are working hard on restoring the forums and making it a lot more organized and easy to use. The next few days you will see major improvements. There are some things that you can claim back:</p>
<p>If you have a thread that you lost and would like to post it again without rewriting it, refer to this: <a href="http://elveron.org/community/index.php?/topic/3-recovering-your-posts/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://elveron.org/community/index.php?/topic/3-recovering-your-posts/</a></p>
<p>If you want your forums points that you earned transfered to your new forums account here, refer to this: <a href="http://elveron.org/community/index.php?/topic/58-claim-forum-points/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://elveron.org/community/index.php?/topic/58-claim-forum-points/</a></p>
<p>If you are requesting your donator or forums rank back, refer to this: <a href="http://elveron.org/community/index.php?/topic/87-request-your-rank/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://elveron.org/community/index.php?/topic/87-request-your-rank/</a></p>
<p>On the bright side, we hit a record of 85 registrations in less than 10 hours <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Hopefully we will see great things to come with our brand new and improved forums. Themes and such are still being tweaked so please be patient.</p>
<p>Next, we now have gone over the rewards and events and <span class="mention">@philelelele</span> 's schedule is now posted in his Events section ( <a href="http://elveron.org/community/index.php?/topic/91-weekly-event-schedule/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://elveron.org/community/index.php?/topic/91-weekly-event-schedule/</a> ). Here you can find all you need so that you will not be missing out on these awesome events. Get ready for a great time with the community! We will also be implementing a beautiful calender with a more user friendly way of viewing and scheduling the events. Can’t wait to see you!</p>
<p>Lastly, we have an awesome new game mode that people have long been awaiting, THE IRON MAN MODE! Test your abilities and chose the hardest game mode possible when creating a new account. This is a very competitive game mode and will appear on the highscores very soon.</p>
<p>WARNING: If caught getting items on an iron man mode account from a regular player account, the iron man account will be permanently disabled. Cheating on an extremely competitive mode is unacceptable and we have enough information logged to know whether an item is legitimate or not.</p>
<p>You guys may appreciate these updates today, I pin pointed things that were of great importance and turned one of the worst days possible into something more positive.</p>
<p>1/8/15</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an exploit with staff pin being avoided.</li>
<li>White Portal FFA is now up and running, in preparation for awesome events!</li>
<li>Increased a lot of security all over the server.</li>
<li>Enhanced the trade logs, now extremely detailed for security reasons.</li>
<li>We now have a legit IPBoard Lisence (woo hoooo!)</li>
<li>New forums set up, new theme, MAJOR CONSTRUCTION.</li>
<li>New Wilderness registration system to keep track of who is in the Wilderness so bugs can’t be abused.</li>
<li>Iron Man mode can now be selected in Character Creation.</li>
<li>Players in Iron Man mode have no Strength Cap and Increased Drop Rates on rare items.</li>
<li>Added in all the Iron Man restrictions, giving the game mode it’s meaning.</li>
<li>Iron Man will be in the highscores very soon, don’t worry.</li>

        <p>So, I planned on releasing a lot today such as fixes and what not, however my computer decided to act up and I can’t finish coding the updates. That means there are unfinished things on the server right now and I can’t restart. I will post the updates tomorrow and I will try to fix up my computer and finish the updates in the morning. Sorry for the inconvenience!</p>
