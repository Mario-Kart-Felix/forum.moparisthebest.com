        <p>Greetings Elveron players, a lot has been going on recently. Our dedicated server is nearly optimized and ready to perform to the best of it’s abilities. There are a lot of technical things that have been worked on the past few days with the website, new equipment we have, etc. Some of this stuff may be boring to you, others may be fascinated. For details, operating system info, etc. you can read about it through this link: <a href="http://elveron.org/community/index.php?threads/linux-linux-linux.59/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://elveron.org/community/index.php?threads/linux-linux-linux.59/</a></p>
<p>Also, we have been undergoing rapid forum development, so fast that I can’t believe it. However <a class="mention" href="../../u/chance.html">@Chance</a> never seems to dissappoint, he is always stepping his game up with each of his updates. There are a bunch to check out in the Developer’s Log as well as a brand new theme that makes the forums so smooth and beautiful on any platform whether it be a computer or a hand held device.</p>
<p>And then as promised, here are your updates. I have been discussing with Brennen recently and a lot of our updates will be aimed at things that have been on the board for a while. Some of the major things are making the server more new-player-friendly or even user friendly. Working on those bugs that people have been moaning about for a while, putting in some content that has gotten a lot of support for ages, etc. So, a new era of Elveron is coming and both Brennen and I will be working hard to bring that to you.</p>
<p>Some people don’t use the grand exchange and that makes it difficult for those who do. Sometimes it seems like there’s nobody selling/buying in the grand exchange. So I decided to implement a system that increases the amount of items sold in the grand exchange.</p>
<ol>
<li>Anything sold to the general store will be sold through the grand exchange.</li>
<li>Anything received through ::coindrops will be sold through the grand exchange.</li>
<li>Anything deleted by ::empty will be sold through the grand exchange.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve thought about the items that disappear on the ground. Maybe those should be sold through the grand exchange. What do you guys think?</p>
<p>5/15/15</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowed recruits to view their clan bank.</li>
<li>Redid the formula for mining.</li>
<li>Added ardougne sewer entrance.</li>
<li>Players can close out of the climber mode interface.</li>
<li>The interfaces in dominion tower now show correctly.</li>
<li>Removed the worldwide ::contest message.</li>
<li>Removed the dialogue option from banks.</li>
<li>Players can choose their bank by speaking to a banker.</li>
<li>Players can also choose their bank with ::bank.</li>
<li>The banker remembers which bank the player chose last.</li>
<li>Clicking bank will open the last bank used by the player.</li>
<li>Anything sold to the general store will be sold through the grand exchange.</li>
<li>Anything received through coindrops will be sold through the grand exchange.</li>
<li>Anything deleted by ::empty will be sold through the grand exchange.</li>
<li>Capitalized words will no longer bypass the censorship system.</li>
<li>The list of profane words has been updated.</li>
<li>The profanity filter button updates on login.</li>
<li>The Dark Energy Core’s damage has a regular hit mark, meaning it will no longer show magic hit marks.</li>
<li>Increased Blazing Flamberg’s stats.</li>
</ul>

<p>The banking issue has been resolved. Now non-donators can use their clan bank. In order to access their clan bank, they have to use the “talk-to” option on bankers. Which ever bank is opened last will be the bank that is opened when clicking the “bank” option. The default bank can be changed through the “talk-to” option or the ::b1, ::b2, and ::cb commands.</p>
<p>Items can be sent to the player’s clan bank with the command ::sendtoclanbank. It’s similar to ::sendtobank (1 or 2) for supreme donators. The commands can be undone by typing them again.</p>
<p>5/16/2015</p>
<ul>
<li>Added ::sendtoclanbank for ::bankdrops and ::bankskills.</li>
<li>Players can choose their bank by speaking to a banker.</li>
<li>Fixed void knight range set effect.</li>
<li>Removed armadyl runes from drop messages.</li>
<li>Fixed rewards from QBD not showing up in the player’s bank.</li>
<li>Fixed Korasi’s special attack.</li>
<li>Fixed Dharok the Wretched’s attack speed.</li>
<li>Metal dragons will shoot fire from a distance.</li>
<li>Barrows interfaces are removed after leaving barrows.</li>
<li>Stopped Spinolyps moving from the water.</li>
<li>Fixed XP lamp dialogues not closing.</li>
<li>Added ::updates command to see future updates.</li>
</ul>

        <p>Just a few quick things before I hop into the bed of excitement and get my good night’s rest. So, sorry that there wasn’t a post recently. I had a college event, my mother’s birthday celebration, etc. all at night so by the time I was going to post, I did not have access to a computer. So here is our stuff.</p>
<p>Also, starting tomorrow <a class="mention" href="../../u/displee.html">@Displee</a> (maffia-rpg) will be working with us on the development team. Terribly sorry I couldn’t announce it today when he introduced himself. I planned to announce it then introduce him, then I realized that my school wifi blocked Elveron over the weekend LOL. So yeah that was an awkward intro but he is very caring for communities and will be interactive with you guys and getting work done. Also this will be to a great advantage because he is a completely opposite timezone of Brennen and I, meaning if there are troubles he will be able to solve the problem if we are asleep/in school.</p>
<p>Lastly, nothing much else to say. All I have right now is this: GET READY FOR A COME BACK! <span class="hashtag">#Elveron</span> <span class="hashtag">#ComeBack</span> <span class="hashtag">#Hashtag</span></p>
<p>5/17/2015-5/19/2015</p>

<li>Fixed Kree’arra teleporting players into walls.</li>
<li>Max’s rewards will be dropped on the ground if inventory is full.</li>
<li>Donation commands automatically give donator tokens.</li>
<li>Increased Blazing Flamberg’s stats.</li>
<li>Changed mining/fishing formula.</li>
<li>Patched PAFTS related with player owned houses.</li>
<li>Invisibility/Godmode bugs patched, thanks Carl.</li>
<li>Fixed dominion tower interfaces on fixed screen size.</li>
<li>Created a new command to view npcs and their drops.</li>
<li>Options include viewing the drops gained after x amount of kills.</li>

        <p>Good news and informative news tonight everyone!</p>
<p>First off most importantly, tomorrow is my last day of school! I will probably not be coming online because of senior-no-more-school-celebrations <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> But then, I will be free as a bird, meaning I will be able to come online timezones I could never make on school days.

        <p>Displee’s done a lot of work on Duel arena and Fist of Guthix recently. You have him to thank for finally adding duel arena back to Elveron. Right now, I see a lot of opportunities for new minigames, perhaps even custom ones. That being said, I’m currently working on a new Zombie minigame. I don’t think there will be waves; rather, players will need to make their way through a maze. There will be traps and keys, and yes, doors. I’ll also be fixing up some small Stealing creation bugs that I found. If you have any suggestions for the new Zombie minigame or minigame fixes you’d like to see, you can post them below or in the suggestions. Soul wars has been mentioned to me a few times. I can work on Soul Wars once the other minigames are finished being worked on. Players seemed to be pretty ecstatic about Bork. What should Bork drop, Dagon’Hai? Maybe Elite black armor? What are your thoughts.</p>
<p>Chance recently resigned, and I wanted to say that he’s done a lot to help out the server. His level of dedication both in-game, and on the forums has been superb. Elveron has seen some dark days, days that I don’t hope to see anymore. Fortunately, the new forums have brought my hope back. This being said, it was not hope that healed Elveron. Let it be known that… Chance healed Elveron. Let it be known that… Elveron is not going anywhere. And let it be known that we will miss you Chance, your work shall not go unnoticed.</p>
<p>5/22/2015 - 5/25/2015</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed magic defence and magic attack formula again.</li>
<li>Lowered mining rates.</li>
<li>Fixed the elite runecrafting skiller task amount.</li>
<li>Only tradable items can be sent to the clan bank.</li>
<li>Updated colors for heroic donator yell.</li>
<li>Fixed several bugs for duel arena, three known bugs are left.</li>
<li>::hideyell actually works.</li>
<li>Yells sent by staff cannot be hidden.</li>
<li>The money pouch message is now filtered.</li>
<li>Added command blackmarks system to automatically ban autotypers for 48 hours.</li>
<li>Fixed certain ip and mac bans for admins.</li>
<li>Fixed bank not showing up when you switch to the equipment screen and closed it.</li>
<li>Fixed items kept on death interface, which was not working properly.</li>

        <p>Sorry for the mass message everyone, just wanted to announce my return to the mighty ELVERON!!!</p>
<p>Hello everyone! It has been a long, chaotic, hectic summer. Nevertheless I am back and ready to bring the server back into glory. I know things have been really out of it and unorganized with my own and Brennen’s activity, but now that we are settled into college we are back in action! Not only will we be back actively, but Titanium will also be developing with us since I am entering my first year of college. There will be many changes, fixes, updates, organization, etc. that all of you have been waiting for a while. I am excited to meet the new players from the past 3 months and absolutely kick ass and bring Elveron back to it’s place holder as one of the best high revision servers out there. It will take time but our new team will be putting in the effort to assure the best play time on the server you will have. Get ready for the massive content pushes again <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <p>Haven’t posted in a bit because I have been doing a lot of behind the scenes work. There have not been a lot of recent requests so I have been working on cleaning up code, rewriting things as I go along, and working on the engine to hopefully improve game performance. Please get some suggestions and bugs posted on our support portal, thanks! <a href="http://elveron.org/login.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://elveron.org/login.php</a></p>

        <p>Finally got settled well into my classes. Glad to have time to start coming back ingame and I love seeing both old faces and new faces it is great. I decided I’m going to start to hammer out the things that I hear all the time so here we are with a nice update tonight.</p>
<p>I have also re introduced the Support Portal where you can post suggestions and bugs. I suggest using this because it makes it easier for the developers and myself to view suggestions and bug reports, ultimately getting them done a lot faster and not forgetting about them. Here you can view progress on requests, vote (thumbs up/down) on ideas, comment on each others posts, etc.</p>

        <p>Well, the official reset is here. Coming back from my summer work break I noticed one thing when I came back. The economy was a disaster, there were features added that really hurt the economy, there were things that already existed that made 1bil seem like little money. And as much as I didn’t want to reset the economy, I got so many messages about the problems in the economy and how many people didn’t want to play with an economy so messed up. So after a few days of testing, we have now patched up the economy so that money has value, rares are actually rares, etc. and we have done an official, FINAL reset. Come online and try out the new Elveron, I’m sure you won’t be disappointed. Now the development team will be moving on to new and great things, so keep your eyes peeled for our new content posted, as I will no longer be broadcasting Elveron updates.</p>

        <p>Hello Elveron,</p>
<p>Today we successfully migrated our server to a GIT server. This will play a huge part in helping prepare our team for future updates. During this massive migration some teleport options stopped functioning and those are now fixed. I have also fixed the master capes to show properly in the inventory.</p>

        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Ty and I am the new developer here at Elveron. Looking back on the old promises that the previous developers have stated makes me truly understand why the hype for the server has declined recently. I am posting this to reassure you that I am not going to let you guys down. I will be making updates (maybe not visible) to the server almost on a daily basis. I am going to focus on making bug fixes for the first few updates to ensure that the server will be stable enough for me to do new content updates.</p>
<p>Without further ado, Here is what I have been up to the last few days:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fish, silver, and new stalls added.</li>
<li>Shops at home have been updated to correctly show the corresponding shops</li>
<li>Fixed sinkhole abuse</li>
<li>Made some minor grammar fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed Corp controller.</li>
<li>Trivia facts has been updated.</li>
<li>NPC’s killed by other NPC’s no longer drop loot. (this will reduce the lag in GWD)<br>
-Corp minions have been updated and revised<br>
-YK’lagor the Thunderous has been updated to the correct animations.<br>
-Minor Slayer fixes with Controllers</li>
</ul>
<p>I am currently going through the NPC locations and fixing them up. This will take some time, so if you do not see any updates for that day, just know that I am working on the NPC spawn system. With this update, you should be able to see a massive improvement to the server with less lag in certain areas.</p>
<p>If you need to contact me with any issues pertaining to the server, please feel free to contact me via PM either ingame or on the Forums!</p>
<p>~Delcorum</p>

        <p>Hello everyone, forgot to post this yesterday so here I am today. So we migrated to CloudFlare servers recently after sorting out the domain issues just to add to our security. Because of that voting was down the past few days, but I have reconfigured the voting so that it works with our new firewall, so now you can continue to enjoy voting! Other than that, I have been working on some basic bug fixes and optimization that will show up in the future. Enjoy everyone!</p>

DAILY, yes the daily posts are officially back with myself and <a class="mention" href="../../u/divinity.html">@Divinity</a>. This is not the past where we would get a post once a week, or twice a month. No we are getting stuff done on a daily basis and Elveron is going to kick ass once again. I’ve been given a list of stuff that had to be worked on while I was gone and now I am solving those one by one. Expect marvelous features to be back.
