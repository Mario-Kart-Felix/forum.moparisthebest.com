<p>Well, the conversion is finished and we are now a pure 742 server. I am very happy now that the hours of work have paid off. This is beneficial to all of us and we have begun cleaning up and rewriting this entire source to have the server running as smoothly as possible. Tomorrow will be a slow day with updates so that we can all relax since this whole conversion has been kicking our ass for the past two weeks. I am exhausted and sick at the moment so I will not write a whole lot, however here are the features for the new conversion.</p>
<p>By the way, you WILL need the newest client to play again. As usual, if you find a bug please report it on the forums and we will work on it.</p>
<p>CONVERSION:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converted to Netty 4.0.25 API. (This is a library we use for establishing connections between client and server). This version is a lot more stable than the older versions we have been using.</li>
<li>With our completely rewritten networking, connections are a lot more stable and secure and you will not be experiencing common disconnections as in the past with our player base.</li>
<li>Rewrote the framework of how the network is handled. Matrix didn’t write their networking correctly versus how Netty wants it to be done. Introducing the use of pipelines and basic multi-threading usage, which can significantly improve server stabiltiy and performance.</li>
<li>Rewrote how the cache is loaded and stored, reduced the ton of mess that existed on the Matrix framework.</li>
<li>Rewrote how the client and server establishes a handshake to start making real connections and rewrote the js5 protocol.</li>
<li>With this we also added in a lot of extra verification and update servers to quickly patch issues and prevent non verified clients such as cheat/bot clients.</li>
<li>Rewrote the login protocol, possible integration of a full lobby which is in progress.</li>
<li>Rewrote how packets are built and deconstructed. Packets now have its own real system where they are filtered and then transmitted to and from the server.</li>
<li>After going through all of the packets (oh the time and pain), packets and masks are no longer getting mixed up with a large volume of players online such as 80+.</li>
<li>This means that if there are a ton of players online, NPC’s will no longer randomly transform, break, send strange animations, etc.</li>
<li>In this time, we also decided to rewrite the content and the cores so that our game runs smoothly and we don’t experience lag with content I poorly wrote ( and Matrix <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) years ago.</li>
<li>Also in the process of rewriting the Game Engine, already implemented handling of server wide tasks rather than a single task for every single player online (oh god the usage on that).</li>
<li>New pure cache, new horizons. We made sure we packed all of this properly so it isn’t buggy as hell and doesn’t crash players all the time. There are many new things that bring in potential new content (already started on Wildy-wide Bounty Hunter) and players won’t have to worry about something like crashing while bossing.</li>
<li>With our pure 742 we now have completed maps and all of the xteas to our revision, meaning you won’t be walking around and crashing all over the place because of broken/poorly packed maps (Kalphite Lair, Seer’s Village, Burthrope, etc.)</li>
<li>Many new packets that we never have discovered before have no been implemented, giving us more opportunities to get creating and add new content (for example with new camera packets we can make cutscenes more in depth).</li>
<li>Animations and emotes are updated and properly packed, and this fixes a variety of things. Nex’s certain attacks no longer crash you, all of the emote tab emotes work (INCLUDING the brand new ones up to the update before EoC). Adds some of Solomon’s too!</li>
<li>Speaking of Solomon’s, we now have his interface in our cache and we are working on his store to use for NEW Loyalty Token rewards compared to our current not so very well shop.</li>
<li>Also similar to Solomon’s, we have the brand new Squeal of Fortune and fixed it up a tad since our other one wasn’t complete. Now we have everything, the new runscripts/configs, etc. INCLUDING the long and beloved 10x SPINNING OPTION!</li>
<li>While we are on the topic of interfaces, all our interfaces are now part of the 742 revision and are no longer a mix of 718, 736, 742, 721, etc. interfaces all over the place, THEY GO HAND IN HAND!</li>
<li>Some of the commonly used interfaces that are updated (and damn it took ages to find all of the hidden components, buttons, etc.) are Clan Settings, Gravestones, Duel Arena (still in progress), Squeal of Fortune, Overlays, etc.</li>
<li>Equipment tab you say? Yes, that was very buggy and annoying, it was actually messed up in the 718 cache. However seeing as it had all the components in the 742 cache, I decided to work on it and now it should function perfectly (thank god!).</li>
<li>In the spirit of interfaces, we took time to rework a lot of the skills and minigames, incorporating new features you will find and fixing pains in the ass like the not being able to purchase a Ring of Kinship for Dungeoneering.</li>
<li>But wait there’s more, NPC combat for you PvMers has been pushed to the max. We have loaded many weaknesses and strengths, and included some new features in our cache that wil increase the experience.</li>
<li>These things include new targeting systems, aggressiveness, HP bar sizes depending on the NPC’s HP capacity (bigger, longer bars <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> for corp/nex/etc).</li>
<li>On the equipment side, many of the items models have been fixed and I know some have been pretty irritating and unattractive to see, and we have double checked most of the weapons/armor to make sure they look great.</li>
<li>Sounds are also an interesting new feature as since we found more sound and noise packets, some dialogues have voices, some weapon attacks have new hit sounds, etc.</li>
<li>Speaking of hits, we incorporated more hitsplats while exploring the hit packets and found some more interesting hitsplats to use like disease, critical hits for range/mage, etc.</li>
<li>Our client has also been worked on a lot and doesn’t have all the unnecessary stuff packed into the Matrix client since ours is from the 742 deob.</li>
<li>Automatic detection of Java versions and analysis of computer specs to determine the best configurations for your computer’s build and also makes suggestions like specific java versions to use, etc.</li>
<li>We have also worked to optimize the graphic settings for both OpenGL and DirectX, featuring a lot less crashes and new settings WORKING like anti alliasing, etc.</li>
<li>Also in the spirit of client stuff, we have been working hard to improve the client conditions for Mac and Linux users because we want everyone to be able to play.</li>
<li>With our new client we also now have both server AND client sided pathfinding/clipping. Now you won’t get stuck running past bank booths at home or getting past that forest of trees, or even fighting the giant Vorago.</li>
<li>Other new features not mentioned of our client are the ability to walk around with WASD movement (like Minecraft &lt;3), the ability to do ctrl + to zoom in and ctrl - to zoom out, screen capturing on demand, and other great things!</li>
<li>There is honestly so much we have done in these 2 weeks I just can’t remember, just find out and enjoy the game <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">

        <p>Despite the controversial feedback I have received recently, I still stayed motivated to improve the server. I was completely aware that there were bugs that would be in the release of the conversion because no game is ever 100% perfect, and we needed this stage in order to find the rest. While we did have a lot of participation in the beta, there were things that just weren’t noticed until played on a large scale of online players today. Even if we spent a lot more time on this with a lot more testers, we still may not have found these things until it was on the live server. Anyways, <span class="mention">@taht</span> one guy and myself will be working hard the next few days on patching these up so that we can see the conversion update in it’s fullest glory. Today was a great start and we are hammering out the list. In the meantime please don’t suggest new things at the moment as we are focused on the new bugs. We would appreciate it if you guys post new bugs that arose after the conversion update, and make sure there isn’t a thread made about the issue already. Thanks!</p>
<p>Ontop of the negative things, I have heard great things as well. Some people who couldn’t even get the client working before have now been able to load our new client and began to play again. I am also hearing great things about the improved performance and stability (aside from these glitches that are being patched as we speak) and through all the positive feedback I gained the motivation to push through all of this, so thank you everyone. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>2/17/15</p>

<p>Well the verdict is clear. With a large majority thinking that Edgeville would be a good new home, we will have moved by tomorrow night. In the following days will be more fixes and adjustments along with new Wilderness content that will get people enticed to PvP and will lure all kinds of players into the Wilderness to carry out new activities.</p>
<p>On another note, there is a new client out. This should have fixed some preference saving issues, improved performance on Mac and Linux operating systems, as well as fixing some crashes relating to certain things.</p>
<p>I loved being ingame with you guys today, now that the conversion is over and I feel a lot less stressed I will be appearing ingame more often and building those player relationships that I need. I may not be online at all tomorrow due to the fact that I am seeing a friend who has been away for the entire year so I don’t want to miss out on that, however expect updates to flow in as usual.</p>
<p>Also, <a class="mention" href="../../u/king.html">@King</a> Fox has an amazing new update to our website that will make Bug Reports and Suggestions a lot more organized and will help us get stuff done faster. Follow his progress here: <a href="http://elveron.org/community/topic/1028-elverons-support-portal/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://elveron.org/community/topic/1028-elverons-support-portal/</a></p>
<p>Lastly, I would like to congratulate <span class="mention">@Stefio</span> and <span class="mention">@YelloFellow</span> (Korean Chain) on their new roles as Support members. The Live Support is now back online with <a class="mention" href="../../u/valkyrie.html">@valkyrie</a> and <span class="mention">@Charity</span> so enjoy some extra assistance. Lastly I would like to welcome <a class="mention" href="../../u/valo.html">@Valo</a> back to the team as our Marketing Manager. Valo was the one who really built Elveron to what it was in it’s glory in the past and now that things are smoothing out development wise, we are ready to kick in our advertisement and bring Elveron back to where it should be.</p>

<p>THAT’S RIGHT YOU GUYS! PLAYERS CAN WIN UP TO $250 WORTH IN PRIZES, READ MORE FOR INFORMATION!</p>
<p>So as we are working towards our great comeback, one thing that is a key feature to getting our player flow: votes. However we never had as much votes as we should have mostly due to our old buggy vote system. Sites weren’t working, the system’s callback was faulty, you could never tell which sites you voted missed or didn’t work, etc. Well after some work our new vote system is back online and you will enjoy it! So everyone, let’s get voting!</p>
<p>On a second note, continue to watch <a class="mention" href="../../u/king.html">@King</a> Fox 's stellar progress on our new major website update which is nearly done: <a href="http://elveron.org/community/topic/1028-elverons-support-portal/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://elveron.org/community/topic/1028-elverons-support-portal/</a></p>

<p>And so went one of the happiest days of my life. Got my first college reply and it happened to be an acceptance from my <span class="hashtag">#1</span> choice, Rochester Institute of Technology for Computer Science/Software Engineering. I am very excited.</p>
<p>Now we are starting on the PvP revamp and I am currently doing a lot to combat while Brennen is working on some content like Bounty Hunter, EP, etc. Today I was able to get 90% of the Lunar Spells complete working with accept aid, all the group spells etc. We are only missing 3 spells that are useless atm so I will do them later. But we have all the combat/stat ones complete for the people who have been craving some of these spells. I have also begun on working on weapon specials and operations that need to be added. There is a lot to go into all of this and I will need to hear from experienced PKers on what is needed to be done.</p>
<p>We are also still fixing bugs, got some of those pesky ones that were bothering us done today, so stay tuned and patient while we work on as much as we can <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Great ideas coming along and myself and <span class="mention">@taht</span> one guy are working hard on the PvP Revamps, today being day one. More to come in the following days.</p>

<p>Sorry for the inconvenience of last night’s updates. Because the forums was down we decided to push the updates into today instead. So, here are two days worth of updates.</p>
<p>PvP Revamps are looking great and there is still much to do. Glad to see people actually boxing and fighting in the Wilderness now and hopefully we can grow.

        <p>Amazing day for me, found out that I just received a $10,000 scholarship to RIT that is renewable every year that I study there. So pumped about that, less debt for me <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Now since it is the beginning of the month and we need votes, double vote rewards will be on for the next few days. So please make sure you are voting twice every day and let’s climb the top lists!</p>
<p>We are also cleaning up the staff team and making demotions to inactive staff. We have had enough of seeing many staff members not active anymore and we are really cutting down. We have known for a while that <a class="mention" href="../../u/quad.html">@Quad</a> and <span class="mention">@Philelele</span> have been less active due to other commitments and they have stepped down so their positions can be filled, but there are still other members to investigate.</p>
<p>This means many new staff positions are open and we will be looking through applications, so make sure that you post an application and prove yourself worthy ingame by being active and helpful to players. Good luck everyone!</p>
<p>2/28/15</p>
<ul>
<li>Players who have spaces in their names can now claim vote rewards.</li>
<li>Patched some of the home “You cannot tele anywhere from here” issues.</li>
<li>Began to make major progress on the world map thanks to Dennis.</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with the voting call backs.</li>
<li>Double game points is now 10,000 game points.</li>
<li>Gave bonuses to all of the weapons in the forum points shop.</li>
<li>Fixed sheathing deleting stats for most weapons.</li>
<li>Voting rewards are now doubled for the next few days, get voting!</li>

        <p>Hello everyone, sorry for not being online today. I had a swim meet that ended up taking hours and then a slow commute because of the snow. Therefore I was gone early in the morning and didn’t come back till night time and I still have homework to do. We didn’t have time for updates today due to the events of today however we have a lot in store for the week so keep an eye out. Sorry for the inconvenience everyone and enjoy the server!</p>
<p>And also just a quick reminder, we are still on the lookout for staff members to fill in our new three empty spots. So make sure that you are showing your best character ingame, helping players out both new and old, and showing that you can be an active and dedicated addition to the team. Also don’t forget to post your applications on the forums ^.^</p>

<p>3/2/15</p>
<ul>
<li>Added in some extra security measures upon login.</li>
<li>IPGuard has been reworked, I suggest using it to prevent compromises.</li>
<li>Spin tickets don’t dc players anymore.</li>
<li>The vote reward amount for coins is now 1m.</li>
<li>The vote reward amount for ecto-tokens is now 20k.</li>
<li>The vote reward amount for spin tokens is now 5.</li>
<li>The vote reward amount for tokens is 100.</li>

        <p>Hello everyone, <a class="mention" href="../../u/apollo.html">@Apollo</a> and I can happily say that all the rolling back is done and the situation is now under control. We are terribly sorry for the inconvenience that this has caused and double exp will be activated until Friday because of this and double vote rewards will carry on until Saturday morning. Luckily, this went a lot more smoothly than we expected as we were preparing for the worst. This has slowed down development, however <span class="mention">@taht</span> one guy and myself are ready to pump out major bug fixes the next few days.</p>
<p>I advise people who can’t login to refer to this thread to gain access to their accounts back: <a href="http://elveron.org/community/topic/1228-you-are-not-banned/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://elveron.org/community/topic/1228-you-are-not-banned/</a></p>
<p>Lastly, I would like to congratulate these three members on their new roles as support: <span class="mention">@Nayhorrorn</span> , <a class="mention" href="../../u/dematt.html">@Dematt</a> , and <span class="mention">@Sparkfear</span> . We are still looking out for one more support member, so continue the hard work!</p>

        <p>Well, getting back to the usual schedule. Today was a slower day than what you will expect in the future due to the reason that we still have some issues to sort out with the hackings. Nethertheless we are still working hard on those bugs you crave to make the server a better place &lt;3</p>
<p>I just want to let everyone know that <span class="mention">@taht</span> one guy and I are PRIORITIZING bugs that are reported in the ELVERON PORTAL! This system organizes things better for us, it allows us to easily track progress, we can set priorities to certain posts, etc. and it completely makes our lives easier. So if you want your voice heard, make sure that you are using the portal which can be found at <a href="http://elveron.org/portal/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://elveron.org/portal/</a></p>
