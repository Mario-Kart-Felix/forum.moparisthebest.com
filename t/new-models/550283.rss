    <description>My models are zipped into models.idx so how can I add new dat files?
I added the dat files to the raw folder but the items are still dwarf remains
I tired to do this:

add model xxxxx
addmodel xxxxx
::addmodel xxxxx</description>

<p>Ehh, no worries. Only thing that annoyed me was because I was literally in the middle of a boss battle on RS (Yeah yeah I still play) and you got me killed. XD</p>
<p>I assume you got the models working?</p>
<p>Also, if you need to, there is a way to dump the models <span class="bbcode-i">out of</span> the compressed models files (the idx and dat). The reason I mention this is because you may/may not have the models in the existing files, and obviously you will need to keep them <span class="bbcode-u">and</span> add yours to it (if that makes sense).<br>
So, you can use this decompressor to rip all the models into a folder, then place your new models + the old ones into the models folder for the compressor, and finally compress the models back into the .idx and .dat.<br>

I’ve benchmarked and tested both systems.<br>
Loading through the raw system takes over a second longer, at least. Depending on how many models you load.</p>
<p>So no, the way I suggested is not as inefficient.<br>
Everything will have some amount of loading time, but preloading is terrible compared to loading the compressed models, and you need to stop suggesting it.</p>

Why change the current system when he can just get the tool to make it work? That's a waste of time, and the compressed files load way faster than preloading anyways.

              <p>My models are zipped into models.idx so how can I add new dat files?<br>

<p>add model xxxxx<br>
addmodel xxxxx<br>
