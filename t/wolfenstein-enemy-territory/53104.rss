[b]From [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein:_Enemy_Territory]Wikipedia[/url]:[/b]
Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory (abbreviated as WOLF:ET, WET, and among gamers, ET) is a freeware first-person shooter (FPS) computer game, and a standalone sequel to Return to Castle Wolfenstein, created by Splash Damage.

Enemy Territory was originally planned to be released as a commercial expansion pack to the popular FPS Return to Castle Wolfenstein. However, due to problems with the single-player aspect, the multiplayer portion was released on May 29, 2003 as a freeware standalone game. In early 2004 the source code for the game logic (not the game engine) was released to the benefit of its modding community. The game uses a modifed RTCW engine, the latter itself being a modified Quake III engine (which is open-source since 2006).

[b]Review:[/b]
This has been one of the funnest online FPS&#39;s I&#39;ve ever played (and it&#39;s free!). It&#39;s set in ye old day (WWII) where you war with the Axis or Allied forces. While it doesn&#39;t have the best graphics engine (though it runs mega fast), the gameplay is absolutely spectacular and can leave you playing it mindlessly for hours on end. There is a bit of class variety and each class has its strengths and weaknesses, just as each of the (official) maps have their own distinctive objectives and the implications of on each team. 

Something I heavily enjoy about ET is Quake3&#39;s non-gayness when it comes to aiming. I&#39;m talking, of course, about games like CS and CoD, where you either stand still and aim or you lose. While you have to aim somewhat at your enemy (:P), more emphasis is really on being able to outmaneuver your opponent and using your classes skills to put them in a position where you have the upper hand. The crazy (and unrealistic :P) physics engine lets you do all sorts of weird shit, sliding down terrain at high speed (try [b][url=http://www.velocity.lunarpages.com/trickjumping.html]trickjumping[/url][/b] out some time, It&#39;s tonnes of fun, a bit like CS surfing but not with ramps), and make big asplosions that send people flying around the place.

Though it&#39;s great fun to play casually, for those  :evil: hardcore FPS&#39;ers out there, the clan tournament play is extremely competitive, it&#39;s well worth playing as a serious game, strategic clan play is both demanding and fun, depending on how good your team is :P.

I simply can&#39;t find anything wrong with this game. It can look decent depending on your graphics config, or can be completely barebones for max performances. The gameplay is excellent, the player community generally aren&#39;t complete immature wingers (cough CS). The learning curve isn&#39;t awfully steep, you should be right into it after a few games.

For them Australians out there, check out the following servers, these two networks are both excellent, well managed, and usually have people on then 24/7.
