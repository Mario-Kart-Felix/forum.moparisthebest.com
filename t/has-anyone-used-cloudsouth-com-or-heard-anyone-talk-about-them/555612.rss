    <description>They have really good dedicated server prices but I see far too little reviews around the web to make any judgement. http://www.cloudsouth.com/ the website looks shit but the specs they are offering on dedicated servers are amazing for the price.</description>

<p>Highly doubt that, I’ve been in the industry for years and in my experience with colo’ing and / or renting servers is I’d say pretty seasoned.</p>
<p>IMO the first thing you should look at is are the dedicated servers customization-enabled builds, can you add additional IPs without getting them leased ( at the 1.00 or below rate, ) and because it’s in florida, I’d look and see how the Hurricanes might affect that particular area in the past few years and in the future. I lived in Jacksonville FL, and I can tell you when I ran my servers at a colo in Metro - downtown a hurricane busted all the windows and my servers were inaccessible even if I drove over there. &amp; it stayed that way for a week or two, which could be costly to your projects, clients etc.</p>
<p>OH! Another piece of advice, CONTACT THEM!!!</p>
<p>They have a toll-free number, US / INT’L and a local address and of course good old fashioned e-mail and ticketing system. Just ask a few easy questions that are more than likely obvious and see there response. Was it professional, well mannered or was it quick and snappy.</p>
<p>&amp; the pricing is great, especially for that small of a DC. BUT a few things throw me off, no bandwidth pricing? As well as the DC hardware ( the actual backend stuff, ) looks mega outdated, get with the times people!!! ( not you, but the DC. )</p>
<p>I’ll edit my post later on with more thoughts. If I were to say the actual servers are good or not… I’d say yes, they’re nice builds.</p>
