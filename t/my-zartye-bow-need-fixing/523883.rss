    <title>My Zartye Bow [Need Fixing]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-zartye-bow-need-fixing/523883</link>
    <description>Okay so I looked around for a Zartye Bow Model. I found it but there are a few problems i&#39;m noticing. When I fire it It&#39;s really close ranged with even the &quot;LongRange&quot; Combat Style? How do I Fix This?
Another thing I would like is if my Zartye Bow could
1. Shoot Faster
2. Have a &quot;Dark Bow&quot; Spec
3. Shoot two arrows at once.

If anyone could please &amp; kindly help me i&#39;d appriciate it.</description>

              <p>Open up Player.java. Search:</p>
<p>public static final int[] BOWS =</p>
<p>And you will see a huge list of IDs. Add your bow to the list like this:</p>
<p>public static final int[] BOWS = 	{YourbowIDhere,9185,839,845,847,851,855,859,841,843,849,853,857,861,4212,4214,4215,11235,4216,4217,4218,4219,4220,4221,4222,4223,6724,4734,4934,4935,4936,4937};</p>
<p>Replace the YourbowIDhere with your bow ID.</p>
<hr>
<p>For Special attack you can just read one of the ‘‘How to add special attack’’ - guide.</p>
<hr>
<p>Seems like you want to make it pretty much like dark bow itself.<br>
You can just go into your client files and label dark bow with zaryte bow’s model.</p>
