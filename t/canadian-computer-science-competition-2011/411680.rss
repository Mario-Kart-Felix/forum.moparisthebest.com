    <description>Hey,

I know it&#39;s well late to ask this but was anyone else in this years compeition? If so list how many problems you got through and your thoughts on how the competition was (Easy/Hard)

I was in the Junior compeition and completed 4 problems, the 5th was way to hard. I had a full hour to finish it and never got more than 20 lines of good code written down for more than 10 minutes until I scraped it and started again :/
