    <title>Need Major help portforwarding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-major-help-portforwarding/227850</link>
    <description>I have finished my server and it currently runs off of hamachi. I really need help portforwarding or an alternate connection so that everyone can connect to my game without hamachi. I looked on my router and it says the devault name and pass. I tried to use this for portforwarding but it doesnt work. Anyone know how i can find out my name and pass for router. I would really apreciate any help with this. Please someone help. :confused:</description>
