    <title>[PI] making areas &quot;safe&quot; [PI]</title>

    <description>Hey guys, I recently moved my server&#39;s home from edgeville to yanille. I ran into a problem though. You cant attack anyone because its a safe area, but you also cant trade because it&#39;s still considered &quot;wilderness&quot;. how can i fix this? any help would be glorious :o
