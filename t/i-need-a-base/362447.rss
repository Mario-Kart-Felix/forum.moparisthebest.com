so what im looking for is a 317 or a 508 {base} if its a 317 i want it to look somewhat like a 508 on the screen but i think that might be on the client side of things.. but i want everything to be included ith the source such as walking following runing umm the lvls in wildy specials. all the stuff a noob coder cant do haha. im not a total noob at copding. i can do some stuff. but i need some help with finding a base that already has the harder coding stuff on it:) pleas help me. i will also need a client for it or somebody to hewlp make a client.

i will not take credit for the work i will give creds to whoever helps me and whoever made the base source:)
