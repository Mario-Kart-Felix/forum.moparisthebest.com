No, I’m saying, dont try to act all romantic, pretty boy cutesy. Every guy would love to fuck a hot chick instead of taking her to dinner and having some fun. Also, you say I run around with my dick out? How? Just because I have had / and like sex? If you seriously, would rather go to dinner than have sex with your girlfriend, you need to break up with her and merry this guy named enrique victoria, number 867-5309.</p>

You’re so wrong.</p>
<p>Just because you’re an insecure, heartless jerk dosn’t mean every guy is. Being Romantic is enjoyable, it gives both the people time to just talk and do the other things in a relationship that arn’t sex. I’d rather go out to dinner first, or even just dinner.</p>
<p>I’m a Virgin, not afraid to say it, and will be waiting for the perfect time.[/quote]</p>
<p>Doesn’t really mean that he is heartless, just that his testosterone is pumping pretty hard right now <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>At my age I’d rather sex. I’ve only been in two relationships but they demand too much. The first time it was as if she was too shy to talk, second time I felt like a piece property. Both were big headache giver’s and every girl is the same in my area. There was one more girl I was gonna ask out, but decided not to and I’d rather stay single and just have fun instead. I’m willing to date when girls start being more realistic.</p>

You will have to care for that child unless the girl has an abortion, which to me shouldn’t be allowed, because the poor child will die.</p>

<p>For real, I like foreplay. I’ve had sex a few times, and I like it when I get her wet and she makes me hard before we have sex. It  makes it feel better and more fun.</p>

<p>You speak good truth. I’m sure many people come out with this… well bullshit yep.<br>
I admit i’m a virgin =) Well kinda. But i’m fricken 14. I haven’t gone the FULL way yet.<br>
And i’m sure half or more the people of the community haven’t, but they sit at home jacking of to a picture of whinnie the pooh.<br>
Anyway The whole world doesn’t revolve around sex. I much enjoy foreplay. Well… anyway let’s not go into that.<br>
But what i’m saying is Jme you talk sense =)</p>
