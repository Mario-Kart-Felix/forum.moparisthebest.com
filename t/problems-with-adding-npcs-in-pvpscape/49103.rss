    <title>Problems with adding NPCs in PVPScape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-adding-npcs-in-pvpscape/49103</link>
    <description>I recently tried to add an NPC to the autospawn list (using PVPScape) so that it would be standing in front of the east bank. I used the same format as all the other npcs are on the list, as they were when i downloaded the source. I used the NPC ID for Party Pete (659) and the coordinates for the spot outside of the bank (Cant remember exactly what they were) but it was a blank spot, and no items were there. Then, when I compiled, it gave me the normal message : 2 lines starting with Note:, then a line about Mod Tahrok, etc, etc. When I started to run the server, I got an error message about the npc I added. AS I said, I used the same format as all the other npcs on the list, except for description, which i changed. COuld that be the problem? If not, what could be?[br][size=1]Posted on: January 18, 2007, 06:49:33 PM[/size][hr]Bump</description>

              <p>The Description may be the problem…It once happened to me…and also some NPCs will crash your server, not all of them work</p>
