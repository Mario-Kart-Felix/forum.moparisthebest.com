[size=14pt][b]About:[/b][/size]
Elysia is a framework I developed with netty 5 networking.
I recently started continuing the development under the name Lunix, with the goal to create a playable game with it.


[size=14pt][b]Custom gameplay?[/b][/size]
I don&#39;t plant on making another remake. I want to make something unique even if it&#39;s not appreciated.
All skills as well as combat are going to be looked at how it can be &quot;different&quot;.
First I want to keep it simple with working with what the basic client has to offer and change actual
play content. Later on I might start modifying a client to my likings.


[size=14pt][b]Current features:[/b][/size]

[ul][li]Dialogues system[/li]
[li]Npc interaction system[/li]
[li]Npc movement and clipped following[/li]
[li]Clipped player movement[/li]
[li]Custom/temporary objects also get clipped[/li]
[li]banking, inventory, equipment, equipping, dropping etc...[/li]
[li]npc/player dying[/li]
[li]shopping[/li]
[li]punishment system[/li]
[li]task system[/li]
[li]data loading with gson[/li]
[li]player commands[/li]
[li]Skilling system[/li][/ul]


[b]Object and ground item updating[/b]
- Custom objects and ground items fill a list of local players when they are spawned.
- When the state changes the players of their local list update the new object.
- When a player enters a region he will be added to the list of local players from the nearby objects/grounditems.

This is a stress test. There is really nothing of lag at this point.
Though the players are very spread and not interacting.

[i]I wont update this very much, just once in a while when I think about it.[/i]</description>
