    <title>What would you like to see in a server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-would-you-like-to-see-in-a-server/194949</link>
    <description>Well I am totally BORED! Am now currently creating a new server, BUT want to know what YOU as moparscape would like to see in a server...

Please post listing ALL ideas you guys have that you want me to put into my new server...

Suggestions so far:
Lunar Magic
Ancients working with multi barrage in multi pk area
Brand new pk area that has never been used
Skilling area
Potions working

Server name I&#39;m using: SiftScape (Idk why, just came to me as a cool name)

Please post and list any ideas that you want to be used in this server...

I will try to add EVERYTHING you post in here in the server so that no1 is left out!

If you have a favorite item you want, please be specific to adding stats if you want...

Maybe a shop you want to be created? TELL ME!

A armor SET that you want to have a special attack, POST IT!!!

I know enough about coding to add specials, emotes, gfx, almost anything you guys can think of... 
(yea I&#39;m setting myself up for D D 3 or iceman to give me some really hard request, BUT THAT&#39;S OK!)

Want a new spell? With a new graphic? TELL ME!
Please list hits if its a new spell, and graphics maybe if you know what graphics there are... If you dont, describe what you want generally so I&#39;ll know what to look for...

Maybe you want a new minigame? Post and tell me what minigame, where and what the theme is, levels etc....

Also please list places you want to see used, like home area, maybe jad area... etc...

POST ALREADY AND STOP READING MY WORDS lul...

NO IDEAS ARE STUPID (except gay ones and well.... stupid ones)!

Please don&#39;t spam or you WILL be reported!

POST ALREADY!</description>

<p>Thank you for the Random Event suggestion, I will DEFFINATELLY use that on the server…</p>
<p>I will make the pk areas brand new…</p>
<p>I will try to get all skills working and a good price set for goods and merchandise…</p>
<p>I will also input a multi barrage for multi pking, and maybe something to do with recoil rings?</p>

              <p>[quote=“Owner Zerk, post:5, topic:194949”]Well personally, I don’t really <span class="bbcode-b">play</span> servers. I’m not interested in that, but I know what people would like to see. Basically, people like to see stuff that is like runescape, except they want it to be like it was before Jagex took a Marijuana overdose, and pretty much screwed themselves over. Here are three of the main things they look for in their category.</p>
<p>~ Skillers ~</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Abviously Skilling. [Mainly Fishing, Cooking, Woodcutting, Firemaking, Fletching etc. etc. Basically some of the most popular skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good economy. Every skiller likes economy for a couple of main reasons. The most important one right now, is to make money. Skilling is just about the best way to make money, so why not skill? Everybody likes that feel of ‘accomplishment’ when they finally collect enough money for that rare we’ve been saving for. It will add the that feel if it is actually a challenge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Random events; Yes… Random events. It might seem impossible, but it isn’t really that difficult. It doesn’t even have to be that random… I came upon a tutorial for Woodcutting a while ago, and there was an addition which listed a ‘spirit tree random.’ I can’t remember if it was random or not, but basically all you have to do is setup an Npc or something that pops up when you do a certain amount of things. For example, you could add a Tree Spirit that pops up every 120 logs you cut. You just need to make a ‘summonNPC’ and I guess some animation like an entangle animation when the NPC comes would put you on the good side as well. This is a little add-on that could make a lot of difference, and put the skiller in an environment that is inviting, as well as the fact that it’s ‘runescape-like’ so it will put the in the zone they are looking for.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>~ Pkers ~</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pkers want variety. Even if you don’t have <span class="bbcode-b">full</span> Pking, then at least fix up Melee, Range, and Mage to make it decent all around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make Pking <span class="bbcode-b">unique.</span> About 70% of servers are Pk servers, and since most Moparscapers only Play moparscape because they fail at real runescape, they only really know about Pk servers, So to them, about 95% of servers are Pk servers. They come upon hundreds of Pk areas every day, and most of them are leeched Pk areas, so they see them even more <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> You aren’t going to keep their attention for long, unless the Pking is different.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small Additions are a must. Whatever it is, ranging from Rings of Recoil and Rings of life, to Vengeance and Multi Barrage. Again, it should be <span class="bbcode-b">different</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>

<p>Lol, nice job there. That is exactly 100% what I’ve wanted from Good Coders. That’s why I want to help him but when you said people only play Moparscape because they fail at Runescape isn’t completely true <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I’m a 94 going for 99 fishing and so far I got 83 but my membership is gone <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
