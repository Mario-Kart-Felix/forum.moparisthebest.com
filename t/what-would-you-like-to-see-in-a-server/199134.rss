              <p><span class="bbcode-b">Commands: </span>No item spawning commands (cheap commands), just ones like ::help and ::info ect.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">spawning: </span>Nope nobody likes it when certain people can spawn and others cant it wrecks the game, thats why no-one can spawn on RS2 except maybe the admins, lol.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">easy xp: </span>no, because everyone will be running around maxed lvl and it would be boring and no noobs to pick on / kill so make it harder to get xp, like RS2’s “4xp per hit” or you could make it 20 or 50, don’t make it like 10000.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">webclient: </span>No you dont really need one, if anything make a client for people to download.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">custom client: </span>No because most people use silab client which has all the new jagex models and they would have to go out of their way to download it just for one server, if every server had its own client there wouldnt be any point. One client per server ur computer will be full and only have like 10-20 clients lol plus all the other shit they might download.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">skills: </span>Try and get all the skills to work because i like to make skiller accounts and if they dont got firemakeing, woodcut or anything theres no point unless im staff or p mod.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">objects to click for xp: </span>No wrecks the whole game because people sit there with auto clickers to get max stats to its not fun make it monster training and again dont make xp 10000 xp if you hit 1 or 2 make it easier than runescape but not one click 1 lvl gained…<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">other: </span>try and fix allot of bugs ect in the server and get a good pking system and maybe make a minigame yourself dont use a c&amp;p one because everyone has Hiyascapes’ God Sword Mini and its getting really boring so try and make a unique one. Try not to use varrock or something for a start because everyone has that and noobs will just say its leeched because of starting location so try and make / find a new starting area. If you make one it would be better because you can put everything where u want! Yes as Graham said i haven’t seen many quests on many servers normally invisible armour quest or spells of the gods thats it try and put some good quests in there and when your confident, try making a brand new quest!</p>
<p>Love to see the ens product and I can help you code it so have fun, “pm” me if you have any questions and hope you finish your server…</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">Commands:</span> Some like ::help but do not give too many advantages.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Spawning:</span> No - ruins economy and unfair even if admins/moderators do it. Also don’t have too many moderators/admins who do not know what they are doing - admins/mods <span class="bbcode-b">moderate</span> the game - meaning they ban users who cause trouble and help players with problems.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Easy xp:</span> Say 5x RuneScape or something - not too fast.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Webclient:</span> No. There already is one. It’s called <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a>.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Custom client:</span> No. People have to download too many custom ones for just a few “recoloured items” - what a waste of space and bandwidth and I don’t particularly mind about the RuneScape graphics (if I did care I wouldn’t play - I would go and play something with many more 3d effects such as WoW)! Also, I never play a server that requires anything other than a plain 317 client. If you don’t require a custom client I am sure that many more people will play your server since all they have to do is get their MoparScape client out or whatever they use and simply type your IP (and port if it is other than 43594).<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Skills:</span> As many as possible.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Objects to click for xp:</span> Maybe dummies up to a certain level - have to stop mass clicking. Not too many - too boring and easy.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Other:</span> Good fighting and pking system, minigames, lots of areas (dungeons, towns). Try to base it in a location that isn’t often done in servers to make it more unique (e.g. I’m doing one of my projects in Entrana which I have rarely seen). Maybe the Tree Gnome area would be good - never seen people use that before. Also, I would like to see lots of working quests in a server, not just a few basic ones. Not necessarily the same as RuneScape (otherwise you might as well just play RuneScape!), but it would nice to see at least 8 or 10.</p>
<p>Good luck in your server (if you are actually making one - hard to see in the post you made). If you do make it with some features in my post of many of the other posts I would be interested in seeing it when it is finished :).</p>
