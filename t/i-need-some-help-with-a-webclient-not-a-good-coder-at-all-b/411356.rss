    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-some-help-with-a-webclient-not-a-good-coder-at-all-b/411356</link>
    <description>I bet there are a milllion posts about webclients but I cant find a tutorial for a webclient WITH custom spirits. I could use a little help. I found a easy webclient, But I don&#39;t want it to stay basic, I want to add custom spirits for it. Its a html versioned one. Do I need to add the custom spirits or do I need a new one all together? I really like the webclient I am using and I hope that I don&#39;t have to change it. any help?</description>
