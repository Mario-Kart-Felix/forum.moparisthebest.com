    <title>Happy Independence Day!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/happy-independence-day/347304</link>
    <description>July 4th is the day us Americans celebrate declaring independence from oppressive England in 1776.  America then proceeded to kick the most powerful empire of the day out of the country with an army mainly composed of militia against an army of British regulars and Hessian mercenaries.

We generally celebrate this day by shooting off fireworks and sometimes our guns, and having cookouts, bonfires and the like.

Anyway, Happy 4th y&#39;all! :D

Well what’s your definition of ‘beer belly’? Anything above the 10% bodyfat mark is going to lack a perpetual 6-pack look. The abs become visible at around the 12% mark iirc, but only when you flex. For the 6 pack look all day every day you’d need to probably sit at around 6% to 8% bodyfat.<br>
tl;dr: Anyone at 15% - 20% is going to have a belly to some extent, and they certainly won’t have the ripped look that someone in the single digits has.</p>
<p>EDIT: This video is cool: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbFGdpQD_O0" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbFGdpQD_O0</a> – There’s a video of Jesse Marunde doing a set of 20 squats too, and it’s insane. If you can man up and do a heavy set of 20, you can probably do anything.<br>
Case in point though: The guy in the video I’ve linked to looks as if he has a beer belly, but odds are he’d fuck you all up when it comes to endurance, strength, and power.[/quote]</p>
<p>They were pretty much like that guy, some had a bit more. A six pac is almost entirely cosmetic.</p>

Soldiers aren’t always guaranteed to eat though, so they need a good amount of body fat.</p>

<p>You mean losing to a bunch of people that were taking a shit in the jungle and joining 2 wars later than everyone else makes you the most powerful? Personally I think it has something to do with spending the most on your military, which is still about 4 times more than china and the uk combined but whatever floats your boat I guess.[/quote]<br>
We won Vietnam, it was counted as a loss when after we left they switched back to communism again.</p>
<p>Militarily it was victory but politically it was a loss. We won almost every engagement we had with the Vietnamese.</p>

<p>Well what’s your definition of ‘beer belly’? Anything above the 10% bodyfat mark is going to lack a perpetual 6-pack look. The abs become visible at around the 12% mark iirc, but only when you flex. For the 6 pack look all day every day you’d need to probably sit at around 6% to 8% bodyfat.<br>
tl;dr: Anyone at 15% - 20% is going to have a belly to some extent, and they certainly won’t have the ripped look that someone in the single digits has.</p>
<p>EDIT: This video is cool: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbFGdpQD_O0" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbFGdpQD_O0</a> – There’s a video of Jesse Marunde doing a set of 20 squats too, and it’s insane. If you can man up and do a heavy set of 20, you can probably do anything.<br>
Case in point though: The guy in the video I’ve linked to looks as if he has a beer belly, but odds are he’d fuck you all up when it comes to endurance, strength, and power.</p>

What the fuck? I’m 70 inches tall, and if I read that chart correctly then ideally I should weigh no more than 192 lbs (or 87kg). If I do then I’ll be subject to bodyfat percentage testing. The minimum weight, 123 lbs or 55kg, is obviously only achievable by females at that height, and slim ones at that.</p>
<p>Admittedly they are a little relaxed with the bodyfat percentage ceilings. In my opinion, I think about 15 - 17% bodyfat is ideal because if you’re infantry, for example, then you could spend weeks in arduous conditions outside in little more than an encampment.<br>
With that said, how many fatties (ie, people pushing the 20% to 25% bodyfat) have you actually seen serving in any American force?<br>
In any footage I’ve seen there haven’t been any.</p>
