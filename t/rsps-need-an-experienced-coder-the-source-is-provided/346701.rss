    <title>[RSPS] Need an experienced coder, the source is provided</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-need-an-experienced-coder-the-source-is-provided/346701</link>
    <description>Listen, I&#39;m getting tired of RS and I honestly need someone who is good with java and can help me code a rsps. I have the source and it is a 317 PK server with NO CUSTOMS. The server is detla-scape based. I&#39;m not asking for a lot but with the donations that we can possibly receive, we may be able to buy a VPS or a Ventrilo server for the people who would want to chat. I need a coder, I&#39;m willing to manage the ventrilo and the vps, my brother (who is also helping) Will take care of the forums and will be the donations manager.

Things that I am looking for and will draw a lot of people to our server are:
-Full Pking
-All weapons to work
-Good hybriding
-Ventrilo
-New PVP WEAPONS, NOT ARMOR. (I figured that the armor is way to overpowered and that the PVP weapons will be a good way to make more money on donations)
-Dragon Claws (Working Special)
-Rune Crossbow (Working Stances)
-Working GodSword Stances
-474 PKing Stances, with 317 Graphics
-Godwars (Maybe just one monster to kill but it should drop things like AGS&#39;s and Sara Swords
-Working Prayer
-Full Mini-games (Barrows, Pest Control, Assualt (Points based, for torso and rune defender)

^^The source contains all of these and it just need some editing. I am not good with java and I wouldn&#39;t like to mess up this great source.

This is the source link, and this is exactly what I want but with some modifications.

<p>That’s where you lost me. Its not that I don’t understand the donations part. Its the fact that you want to leech someones server, and slightly edit it. Call it yours, and profit from it. RSPS, to me, is something to learn from, and not to do, just to make some spare cash. You should get a real job for that.</p>

<p>Yet you didn’t do a think to deserve that money but leech a server. Yeah you are gay, also this isn’t allow you can’t request coders, if you want to start a development team make a topic in the Team development section not here.</p>
