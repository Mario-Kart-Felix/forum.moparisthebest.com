    <title>Sharing Server Files w/ Others; VERY USEFUL; DropBox Program; Developing Servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sharing-server-files-w-others-very-useful-dropbox-program-developing-servers/278883</link>
    <description>First off, I would like to say that this has nothing to do with any developments I have done to my server. The reason I&#39;m posting this in this section is because this topic has to do with developing a server. I also have gotten confirmation from one of the Staff Members, Tico135, that this would be okay to post here. This topic will help make running a server with your Staff and Owners so much easier, communicate so much better, and benefit dramatically from it. I believe this program is a necessity for these forums and your server for you and your Staff which is the reason why I am posting this in the [b]Server Development[/b] section, because this will help people a lot in developing their server. Moving on;

Does somebody you know co-own a server with you? Do you have a second Owner with your server that you want them to have access to the server and its files so they can change and edit things too but you can&#39;t because it&#39;s all from your computer? Does someone host your server and whenever you want to update it, you have to send them your files? You can say goodbye to those problems with this godsend program. The program is called &#39;DropBox&#39;.

Here was my problem. I own a server named UniversalScape with a guy named Dillon. Dillon and I always encountered problems when I wasn&#39;t online. One problem was if somebody swore on my game, he couldn&#39;t check the chat logs. If someone swore in ::yell, he couldn&#39;t check the yell logs. If there was a bug or glitch or a mistyped word in the game, he couldn&#39;t edit to fix it. With DropBox, it fixed absolutely all of our problems.
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[b]Ok, so I keep talking about this program called DropBox. What does it do?[/b]

It basically shares any files you choose on your computer with someone else on their computer. Any changes YOU make to those files, automatically update and change on the other person&#39;s computer. Any changes THEY make to those files, automatically update and change on your computer. Not only can these be accessed from yours and his computer, but the files will also be available on your DropBox account on the internet. If my Co-Owner wanted to change our login message from &quot;Welcome to UniversalScape.&quot; to &quot;Welcome to ~UniversalScape~.&quot;, he will have the ability to open up the client class, change the text, save, exit, and compile. When he does that, those changes will take effect to my computer immediately after the change. Anything they delete will be deleted from your computer also, but may be recovered at ANY TIME from your DropBox account via internet. Anything they add to that folder will also be added to your folders and your computer.
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[b]So you probably get the idea and gist of it now, but how can this help me?[/b]

If you, the original owner, is not online and the Co-Owner is, he&#39;ll have the ability to do things such as check chat logs, check ban logs, and any other logs you may have, edit the server, edit character files, manually ban or IP ban a player, and very importantly, un-IP ban players, which I KNOW is an issue with some people. This may also take some stress off the original owner because he wouldn&#39;t be in charge of absolutely everything. Of course, this is all on a trust level, meaning you would need your Co-Owner&#39;s trust before attempting to share your files and give him/her so much power.

This is also perfect if you have someone who hosts your server for you. Instead of sending them the files every time you want your server updated, this can all be done and you don&#39;t even need to bother telling the hoster about the changes. You may just do it and be done with it. Of course, you may need to tell him to restart the server, but that&#39;s pretty much it. No more uploading them to the internet or sending them through Skype/AIM/MSN etc. every time you want the server updated.
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[b]Will they have access to any other files on my computer?[/b]

Once you have downloaded the DropBox program, a folder is created on your computer named &#39;My Dropbox&#39;. Any files you want them to have access to can be placed in that folder and any other files on your computer WILL be safe and cannot be harmed at all.
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[b]What happens if my Co-Owner decides he wants to run the server from his computer?[/b]

If that&#39;s the case and he turns it on, all that would change is the IP. All the files and characters will be connected to the server being ran on his computer.

Let&#39;s say Person 1&#39;s IP is 12.345.678.90 and Person 2&#39;s IP is 11.111.111.11. If Person 1, who is the Owner, runs the server and players log in with his IP, then he decides to turn his off and let Player 2, the Co-Owner run the server for a little bit, then the players logging in would have to use the IP 11.111.111.11, rather than 12.345.678.90. Since the files that run the server are all coming from the same source, then the player&#39;s character will not change or reset at all. It would almost act like a second world. You may, at times though, come upon files being created what are called &#39;Conflicted files&#39; in your character folder. These are perfectly harmless and cannot effect the server at all. Just simply delete these files and move on. This would also be good if the Owner would love to take a break from running the server for a little bit and let the Co-Owner run it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~


I, myself, believe this program is ABSOLUTELY 110% needed on these forums. More experienced coders could help the less experienced coders way more and more efficiently, rather than using TeamViewer which is very messy and slow in my opinion. If a friend wanted to help out another friend and didn&#39;t want to be bothered to leave his house to help his friend on his computer, it can all just be done straight from his computer. I believe this program can help revolutionize the way server-owning is done and can also be very beneficial for these forums, as I have stated above. Again, I do understand that there has been no server development done in this topic, but I believe that this program should be a [b]requirement[/b] in developing your server, which is why, again, I have posted this in the server development section because I want EVERYONE to know about this wonderful, stable, well-known, perfectly safe program and how it DOES benefit with your server and developing it.

[b]Download Link:[/b] [url=https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTEwNTM1NzY5]Click Here![/url]

If you want anymore, clear information about this program, please see a video here: www.getdropbox.com/screencast

Other than that if you have any other questions about this program, please feel free to post any here or PM me. I ask you to. I would love to answer any questions about this program. I hope you enjoy! Happy developing!

[b]Credits:[/b] I take no credits for this program, as I have not made it, nor am I involved with it. I give 100% credits to the company &#39;Dropbox&#39; (© 2009 Dropbox) If I take any credit at all, it would be me typing this up and explaining about this wonderful program.

note to everyone: dropbox fucking sucks for collaborative programming, please learn to use a VCS like Git or SVN etc. since they’re aimed at programmers rather than just people who wish to share files with each other. one great feature is that they automatically keep a backlog of revisions of the source code of a project so if you fuck up and can’t tell where you went wrong, you can just revert to a previous version very easily. they also make dealing with multiple changes to a file from multiple people easy to cope with, so you don’t have a tonne of modified files that need a manual merging together and have lots of irritating clashes. also it’s usually much less hassle to add people to a project with them than it is with dropbox, and managing collaborators is usually easier too.</p>
<p>i know this has been stated already, but it’s important and ultimately makes everyone’s lives easier.<br>

<p>It’s quite obvious there are better methods. If you thought that I thought this is the best method, then you thought wrong. I don’t fuck with any of what you said, or DropBox. I just use SSH and SFTP, but this is for beginners who aren’t familiar with any of that shit you mentioned. You can still revert back to old versions with this as well, and dealing with multiple changes from multiple people on a file which might cause conflicts shouldn’t be that hard, if you know how to communicate with a human. I don’t know why you’re trying to dog this, it’s not like it’s a complete piece of shit. I guess it must have been worth your time and energy though…?[/quote]<br>

<p>So, all in all, if you’re smart you’ll do fine, but with any bad luck at all you’ll be fucked up the asshole so hard you just won’t want to be assed to deal with it.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is not advanced enough to scale up to current version-control systems such as Subversion, Git, Mercurial, or TFS; all of which will do just fine.[/quote]</p>
<p>Which is why I said it’s all about trusting the other person. Besides, even if they do decide to delete some files, the files are still in your account on the DropBox website so you can just kick the other person out of the folder, and simply restore all of the files they deleted. Plus, the website even frequently saves different versions of the files, so you could restore the file back to what it was on a previous date. If the other person messes up on the code, then I’m pretty sure it could be very simple to fix. Yes, it would be annoying, but once again it’s all about trusting the other person and knowing they know what they’re doing, and like I said before, you can simply restore the file to what it was on a previous date. You can’t really lose with this program and no one can really do any powerful damage to your server.</p>
