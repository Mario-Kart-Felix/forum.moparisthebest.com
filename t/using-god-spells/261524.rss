    <title>Using god spells</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/using-god-spells/261524</link>
    <description>On my buddy&#39;s server when I attempt to cast a god spell it just disconnects me, any idea why? Does anyone know if something might need to be altered to make god spells work as I know in normal runescape you have to have a certain magic level and go about casting a certain number of spells in the mage area before being able to use it else where, is there a way around this?  If so, would you please inform me and direct me where I can find such coding or what not?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 10, 2009, 08:27:22 pm[/size][hr]haha I just realized that no magic works in pvp, anyone know why this would be?</description>
