    <description>Hi. I made my own private server, and the ip adress is shavdicescape.no-ip.org          I can log into it fine on moparscape but when my friends try it doesn&#39;t work.  :confused:  I have already set java environmental variables and my no-ip is always running. I have also already port-forwarded. When my friends log in on my server command prompt window it says that they logged in, but on their computer it says error connecting to server. Please Help!!!!!!!!! Thank You :D</description>
