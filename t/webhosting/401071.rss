    <description>Hi!

I know there is a sticky but its just a sticky and I&#39;m looking for specific reviews/discussion re: What is the best webhosting in your oppinion for my requirements? Bandwitdh, restrictions, hidden fees?

my main requirements are:
PHP, MySQL, bandwidth (anywhere from 100MB - 4/5 gigs... 10 gigs during 1 month in the entire year),  preferably able to execute scripts quick (unlike some hosts where they bog down processing speeds)

I recently am hosting with BlueHost $68 CAD I got 2 years of  &quot;unlimited&quot; bandwidth and pretty much everything, but with recent research on the host I have found some pretty bad reviews which I have not personally experienced myself such as &quot;5000 file limit&quot; or long down times so has anyone else used this host and have a review? I guess I think the reviews in google maybe written by bluehost&#39;s competitors..

What are some of the hosts you&#39;ve used and would recommend for my second site? It&#39;s less of a site and more of a play zone for me to develop things/test things after they&#39;re developed and tested on my local server.

SO: [b]What do YOU recommend and Why?[/b]</description>
