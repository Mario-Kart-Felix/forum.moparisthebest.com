<p>It sounds to me like he’s played for around 2-3 years, maybe longer. Although the way he plays it seems like he only focuses on heavy metal and metal core styles of playing. If you know him personally then you should suggest to him to branch out his style into blues, his weak points are his solos, and blues helps a lot with solos because a lot of blues can be used as improvisation and helps the player create better solos.<br>
