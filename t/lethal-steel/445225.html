        <p>They sound pretty good for only playing together a few weeks. The lead guitarist needs to work on his palm-mute touch though, he should vary the weight of his palm on the strings rather than just keeping it the same for every song, it adds a new tone to each track therefore helping varying their songs. They’re really good for their play time though.</p>

It’ll get better the longer they play together and when they actually find their own sound and perfect it.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like he’s played for around 2-3 years, maybe longer. Although the way he plays it seems like he only focuses on heavy metal and metal core styles of playing. If you know him personally then you should suggest to him to branch out his style into blues, his weak points are his solos, and blues helps a lot with solos because a lot of blues can be used as improvisation and helps the player create better solos.</p>

<p>I didn’t realise you played, I teach a small group of people at the weekends, I’ve been playing for about 8 years now, I love guitar.</p>
<p>I hear a metalcore influence in “Don’t look back” although, it could also be mistaken for a more modern heavy metal sound.</p>

<p>It sounds to me like he’s played for around 2-3 years, maybe longer. Although the way he plays it seems like he only focuses on heavy metal and metal core styles of playing. If you know him personally then you should suggest to him to branch out his style into blues, his weak points are his solos, and blues helps a lot with solos because a lot of blues can be used as improvisation and helps the player create better solos.<br>
