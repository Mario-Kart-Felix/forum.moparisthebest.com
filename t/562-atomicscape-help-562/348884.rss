    <title>[562] AtomicScape - Help [562]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-atomicscape-help-562/348884</link>
    <description>*NEW*
-On AtomicScape Source how would I make it so that players can wield Inferno Adze and how would I add shops?
-How would I edit the Server announcements?

I truly need help with the AtomicScape Source.  The problem is that I cannot find the file to add commands and the command prompt that you use (`) to enter the prompt does not work.

QUESTIONS:
-How to use command prompt
-How to add commands
(AtomicScape Source)

Examples:
-I have opened the prompt using (`) and I am confused on what to enter to spawn items etc.
-I have entered: ::item, ::pickup, item (alone), pickup (alone).
*[To add on after I either entered ::item, ::pickup, item (alone) and pickup (alone) I entered the correct format that you would normally use such as ::item 11695 1 etc]

Adding commands problem/s:
-I have searched for a file that uses :: and nothing will come up.  I have also entered &quot;command&quot; into the search and it only showed me these files:
*CommandScreenHandler CLASS File
*[5 other files of same name]
*content Windows Command Script
*combat Windows Command Script
*packetHandlers XML Document
*CommandPacketHandler.java SVN-BASE File

These are the problems that I have encountered and if you will please answer them comment below.  *(If you need more information comment)</description>
