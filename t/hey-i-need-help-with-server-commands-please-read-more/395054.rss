<p>Chances are, if you don’t even know where to start. You should probably stop trying to make a server at all. It’s not just a game. It’s a very complex thing. While it’s fun to play. It’s a tough job programming.</p>
<p>And a tip of advice. Don’t ask for help, unless you’ve first tried to help yourself.</p>
