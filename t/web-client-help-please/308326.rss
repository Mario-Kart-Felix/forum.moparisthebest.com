    <description>Hi, I followed Ric&#39;s tutorial on making a web client and last night I got everything working except it wouldn&#39;t find my sprites, I re-read ric&#39;s tutorial and found out that I had missed a step, So I went back and re did it... I set the ./Sprites/ to 
C:/.rs2forum_file_store_32/Sprites/    (rs2forum is my server/clients name)
after i did that re jarred and re signed my client and uploaded it to my server.. now after it downloads as the cache, after it &quot;unpacks the files&quot; I get this
[URL=http://img39.imageshack.us/i/errorbj.jpg/][IMG]http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/8755/errorbj.th.jpg[/img][/URL]


Any idea on how to fix this? anyone know what i did wrong, please specify if you have the solution im sorta new to java.
