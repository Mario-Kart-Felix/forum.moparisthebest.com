<p>Nah, didn’t mean about changing your ip i mean your ISP (Internet Service Provider AKA the dudes you pay for your internet) might have blocked your ports from there so you might have to call them and tell them to open up everything.</p>

<p>Sometimes the problem comes from your ISP, they may have blocked all of your ports, i had that problem once and i couldn’t host a website (port 80) neither host a server and i did the <span class="bbcode-b">exact</span> same things as you so i called them, told them about the problem and suddenly from my ip being 85.<strong><em>.<em><strong>.</strong> it became 77.</em></em>.</strong>.* and now all my ports are working fine. I can host anything i want.</p>

</aside>
<p>What is ISP?<br>
And I already changed my ip few times by simple pluging out my router and modem for 15 mins.</p>
