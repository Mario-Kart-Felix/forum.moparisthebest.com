<p>The way you said that, it sounds like you expect it to happen with the snap of your fingers. Java does not equal 7 + 6, if that’s what you’re hoping.</p>
<p>Now, you can <span class="bbcode-i">understand Java better</span> by either looking at a source, looking at codes, or going to help websites. Just search with google.</p>

<p>Lol, My Testscape, Lol better that Project16 by far.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Answer for me the following questions and then you can say Testscape is better:</p>
<p>-Can your source last more then 3 hours without crashing?</p>
<p>-Does your useWith work?</p>
<p>-Can you make mods, admins, and staff members just by typeing there name and saving (no compiling and no extra code)?</p>
<p>-CastleWars?</p>
<p>-Project 16 has everything Testscape does + more.</p>
<p>-Project 16 is slowly, but surely, turning to the same types of coding Cheezscape and Testscape use.</p>
<p>-Testscape is the most bugged source in existance.</p>
<p>-People very rarely complain about bugs that are in P16 but no Testscape, or any bugs at all for that matter.</p>
<p>-People can pk extremely laggy and bad on Testscape but P16 runs smoothly.</p>
<p>I can just keep going on, but then I would get more technical and all people want is fun. So, really, answer my questions and comment against my comments. XD</p>

<p>Yes, go to my post in the downloads section with the list if server source downloads. Download Project 16 version 6/ edit 7/ edit 8.</p>
<p>Then if you want to learn Java and have fun, you must NOT listen to the noobs and you MUST have a lot of experience in RuneScape if you want to code private servers (personal but helpful suggestion.) You also 100% MUST have the will to learn. You will want to know and get a long like a sibling the “Trial and error” method.  Finally, to learn the Java you want for these sources, go to the tutorials section and study and edit inside your own source what it does. Eventually you can move up to fooling around with new ideas and making your own tutorials. Then you can learn about clients, caches, deobs, and how they all connect. Then you can come to my Project 4 thread and join my team because I will finally have another person who knows what they are doing on the team. XD</p>
