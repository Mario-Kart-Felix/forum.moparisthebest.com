    <title>[PI] Code to give Char donar after donating</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-code-to-give-char-donar-after-donating/417971</link>
    <description>Ive followed TUTS on how to set up auto donating and have all that worked out, now what Im trying to find/figure out is a snippet that would give the user donar status after they pay for it

What I have is [code]

if(prod == 1 &amp;&amp; price == 10){
                                                        c.getItems().addItem(995,50000000);
[/code]
The product id is 1 and it costs $10 for donar status and 50m. I don&#39;t know how to make it change the CHAR file to donator = 1.

Any help would be amazingly appreciated!</description>
