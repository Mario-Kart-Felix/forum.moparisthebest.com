<p>and under all that might be more colors… and or some animations…it all depends on your client.</p>
<p>step 3:<br>
change the j2 and i3  int values to the ones you need<br>
lets say you want white txt… you would do this to that code</p>
<p>[quote]<br>
the j2 code is for the color of the txt… the i3 code is for the action. this stuff gets to be simple as people go but obiously nobody ever uses he ctrl+f command to search a file anymore… and thinks they much open class files… all a class file is, is a compiled java file. As long as your compiler acually works for you, you shouldnt need to EVER touch a class file<br>
int j2 = 5; int i3 = 0;<br>
[/quote][/quote]</p>
<p>ok, im gunna try that but first, why do you say that. just because i said client class u think i mean client.class but infact, client class is the same as client.java.</p>
<p>people who know java abit use client class.</p>
<p>also, when i go into client class and i search it, nothing comes up…</p>
<p>FIXED. ty for the codes.</p>
