    <title>Does anyone has dutch at their school?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anyone-has-dutch-at-their-school/3482</link>
    <description>I was wondering if people have the possibility tochoose Dutch as a &#39;optinal&#39; language at their school. I know some scools in Australia have it. Do you have? :)</description>
