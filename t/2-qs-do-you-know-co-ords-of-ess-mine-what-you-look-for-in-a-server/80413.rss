    <description>Hey i could do with the codes for the rune essence mine, so if you have them please share.

Also, what do you look for in a server? Ultimate Pking??? Do you like to be given 9999mill straight away or want a proper econemy? Do you prefer to get max stats in the space of an hour or a year??? give all feedback about anything related.
