    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-changing-the-requirements-on-weapons/289997</link>
    <description>Unfortunately the last time i used these forums.. I got annoyed by all the little kids that never shut up about spoon feeding and other crap... point being.. I don&#39;t care what you say, but if come into my topic to tell me how stupid i am or how easy it is to do... then GTFO instantly..

All I want to do is make rune weapons have lower requirements like 5 attack or something.. Dont ask why cause I really don&#39;t plan on telling you.. First things First.. Where would I go about finding the requirements anyways? in the Client.java? Clickingmost? Wearing? I&#39;ve searched them all and didn&#39;t see exactly what im looking for.. anyhelp?</description>
