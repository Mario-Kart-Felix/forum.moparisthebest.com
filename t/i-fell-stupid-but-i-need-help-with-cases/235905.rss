    <description>OK

Im making my quest Tab do certain commands.

Ok i made a method and it looks like this

[code=javascript]
    public void foodbutton() {
            addItem(392, 200);
	}
[/code]

ok and now in the switch actionbuttonID

i made this case

[code=javascript]
            case 7332:
            	foodbutton();
                break;
[/code]

but when i click on the quest with that id it doesn&#39;t do anything.</description>

to your question i think it would be something like that but then again it doesn’t look right… and is ur source a 317,377,501,508?<br>

Wow, Seroiuslly man. You make the most pointless posts. First can I have your source so I can leech it. ROFLCOPTER<br>
2) is it 317,377,501 or 508 cuz I like to leech 377’s</p>
<p>LOSER!![/quote]you’re an idiot. he didn’t post “can i have your source”, it was someone else. And his post here wasn’t pointless…</p>
<p>Although, yours was. gtfo.</p>
<p>[quote=“daniel89, post:18, topic:235905”]So heres the deal for some odd reason from the quest id 7332 to id 7348 they dont work as a action button. But for the quest big chompy bird and down they work under the case 185: acition button. As for the ones above that they act as a sendquest line and dont have a action button id. If you look when you click on the quest big chompy then look on your run server window you will say it says what action button it is under case 185. None of the ones above that work like that.</p>
<p>Im guessin it has something to do when allstar made that server and i have it downloaded since the main lines of the quest interface were used for information display. They disabled the action button somehow for those certain quest lines.</p>
<p>I can’t figure it out but i will keep lookin to find a fix for it.[/quote]It’s because he replaced the default runescape quests with his own text using sendQuest. every default is used as an action button. But i want to make it so that the sendQuest you create in the quest tab are clickable.</p>

<p>Nice code conventions, however this is the wrong action button id. Use this for the first quest.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">case 28164:
    foodbutton();
    break;</code></pre>
<p>add this above the switch statement (switch(actionbuttonID))</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">System.out.println("Action Button: "+actionButtonId+".");</code></pre>
<p>You may need to edit the actionButtonId part to fit yours.</p>
