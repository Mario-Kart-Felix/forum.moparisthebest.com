Well, I&#39;ve been working on this for the past month, and I have around another 3 weeks planned development time before I would like to start to advertise. 

Suprise, suprise, it&#39;s a 639 Dementhium, but I want the features to be something people have never seen before. Some concepts may be familiar, but the way I do them are all from scratch.

[COLOR=red][i]All criticism and/or negativity is [b]WELCOME[/b], otherwise how else would we improve?[/i][/COLOR]

[SIZE=5][B][COLOR=maroon]Notable Features[/COLOR][/B][/SIZE]

[ul][li]Spawn server (items cost coins to spawn)[/li]
[li]Kill streak system with perks[/li]
[li]Achievements[/li]
[li]Earn PK Points corresponding to the amount of damage you do per fight[/li]
[li]Exchange the PKP for Tokens, which can be spent on the best items, or traded between players[/li]
[li]No items are &quot;donator only&quot;, everyone has an equal chance in the Wilderness[/li]
[li]Completely new concept to Castle Wars[/li]
[li]Fullscreen and HD compatible[/li]
[li]Every major weapon, special attack, magic spell and equipment effect works as expected[/li]
[li]Tz-Tok-Jad can be found in the Wilderness for a challenging aspect to getting fire capes[/li]
[li]Fully automated donation system with 1 month and 6 month countdowns[/li]
[li]Ever expanding statistics menu[/li]
[li]Cheapest subscription and donation prices around[/li][/ul]


[i][SIZE=1]Membership days countdown.[/SIZE][/i]

[i][SIZE=1]Dying to Jad as I kill him.[/SIZE][/i]
[img]http://puu.sh/396fq.png[/img]

[SIZE=5][B][COLOR=maroon]How It Works[/COLOR][/B][/SIZE]
Players will be able to spawn most items and supplies with their coins they start with. Killing other players will result in PKP correpsonding to the amount of damage you manage to do in that fight, and it would be wise to collect your loot to use or sell for more coins.

[i][SIZE=1]Demonstrating that item spawning costs coins.[/SIZE][/i]
[img]http://puu.sh/395UI.png[/img]

If you can kill people without dying, you earn certain perks for certain milestones. Currently the kill streak perks are for 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 25 kills in a row.

[i][SIZE=1]Kill messages  have been reduced to 2-3 lines as opposed to 5.[/SIZE][/i]
[img]http://puu.sh/332a4[/img]

[SIZE=5][B][COLOR=maroon]Castle Wars Minigame[/COLOR][/B][/SIZE]

[i][SIZE=1]Up a tier for a kill, down a tier for a death. The Castle Wars Minigame.[/SIZE][/i]
[img]http://puu.sh/38yUY[/img]

If you have ever played &quot;Gun Game&quot; on Call of Duty Black OPs, you will understand the concept immediately. Basically, you enter the minigame (empty inventory and equipment) and you will be given a bronze dagger, already equipped. It&#39;s kill or be killed.

For every player you kill, you go up a tier. For every player that kills you, you go down a tier. There are 21 tiers in total and for each tier you go up, you obtain a better weapon. 


[ul][li][b]Tier 1:[/b] bronze dagger[/li]
[li][b]Tier 2:[/b] steel mace[/li]
[li][b]Tier 3:[/b] mithril warhammer[/li]
[li][b]Tier 4:[/b] rune scimitar[/li]
[li][b]Tier 5:[/b] magic shortbow and 1000 rune arrows[/li]
[li][b]Tier 6:[/b] granite maul[/li]
[li][b]Tier 7:[/b] dragon dagger (s)[/li]
[li][b]Tier 8:[/b] dragon scimitar[/li]
[li][b]Tier 9:[/b] torag&#39;s hammers[/li]
[li][b]Tier 10:[/b] dharok&#39;s greataxe[/li]
[li][b]Tier 11:[/b] abyssal whip[/li]
[li][b]Tier 12:[/b] crystal bow[/li]
[li][b]Tier 13:[/b] dark bow and 1000 dragon arrows[/li]
[li][b]Tier 14:[/b] 1000 ice barrages[/li]
[li][b]Tier 15:[/b] rune crossbow and 1000 dragon bolts (e)[/li]
[li][b]Tier 16:[/b] armadyl godsword[/li]
[li][b]Tier 17:[/b] chaotic rapier[/li]
[li][b]Tier 18:[/b] chaotic longsword[/li]
[li][b]Tier 18:[/b] chaotic maul[/li]
[li][b]Tier 20:[/b] vesta longsword[/li]
[li][b]Tier 21:[/b] dragon claws[/li][/ul]


If you manage to kill someone on the last tier, you will win 25m for that costly spawning and a mysterious box for some unique equipment unobtainable else where. [SIZE=1][COLOR=&quot;#696969&quot;]Okay, it&#39;s void pieces.[/COLOR][/SIZE]

              <p>I have decided to put the development into an alpha state, as it is in a playable state but there has been no where near enough testing before moving on to a beta and then an official release. Alpha and beta both plan to be short but sufficient lengths of time, because I don’t want to be stuck on “development” status forever.</p>

<p>Well, I’ve been working on this for the past month, and I have around another 3 weeks planned development time before I would like to start to advertise.</p>
<p>Suprise, suprise, it’s a 639 Dementhium, but I want the features to be something people have never seen before. Some concepts may be familiar, but the way I do them are all from scratch.</p>
<p>[COLOR=red]<span class="bbcode-i">All criticism and/or negativity is <span class="bbcode-b">WELCOME</span>, otherwise how else would we improve?</span>[/COLOR]</p>
<p>[SIZE=5]<span class="bbcode-b">[COLOR=maroon]Notable Features[/COLOR]</span>[/SIZE]</p>
<p>[ul][li]Spawn server (items cost coins to spawn)[/li]<br>
[li]Kill streak system with perks[/li]<br>
[li]Achievements[/li]<br>
[li]Earn PK Points corresponding to the amount of damage you do per fight[/li]<br>
[li]Exchange the PKP for Tokens, which can be spent on the best items, or traded between players[/li]<br>
[li]No items are “donator only”, everyone has an equal chance in the Wilderness[/li]<br>
[li]Completely new concept to Castle Wars[/li]<br>
[li]Fullscreen and HD compatible[/li]<br>
[li]Every major weapon, special attack, magic spell and equipment effect works as expected[/li]<br>
[li]Tz-Tok-Jad can be found in the Wilderness for a challenging aspect to getting fire capes[/li]<br>
[li]Fully automated donation system with 1 month and 6 month countdowns[/li]<br>
[li]Ever expanding statistics menu[/li]<br>
[li]Cheapest subscription and donation prices around[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[SIZE=1]Membership days countdown.[/SIZE]</span><br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/395ye" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[SIZE=1]Dying to Jad as I kill him.[/SIZE]</span><br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/396fq.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>[SIZE=5]<span class="bbcode-b">[COLOR=maroon]How It Works[/COLOR]</span>[/SIZE]<br>
Players will be able to spawn most items and supplies with their coins they start with. Killing other players will result in PKP correpsonding to the amount of damage you manage to do in that fight, and it would be wise to collect your loot to use or sell for more coins.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[SIZE=1]Demonstrating that item spawning costs coins.[/SIZE]</span><br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/395UI.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>If you can kill people without dying, you earn certain perks for certain milestones. Currently the kill streak perks are for 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 25 kills in a row.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[SIZE=1]Kill messages  have been reduced to 2-3 lines as opposed to 5.[/SIZE]</span><br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/332a4" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>[SIZE=5]<span class="bbcode-b">[COLOR=maroon]Castle Wars Minigame[/COLOR]</span>[/SIZE]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[SIZE=1]Up a tier for a kill, down a tier for a death. The Castle Wars Minigame.[/SIZE]</span><br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/38yUY" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>If you have ever played “Gun Game” on Call of Duty Black OPs, you will understand the concept immediately. Basically, you enter the minigame (empty inventory and equipment) and you will be given a bronze dagger, already equipped. It’s kill or be killed.</p>
<p>For every player you kill, you go up a tier. For every player that kills you, you go down a tier. There are 21 tiers in total and for each tier you go up, you obtain a better weapon.</p>
<p>[ul][li]<span class="bbcode-b">Tier 1:</span> bronze dagger[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Tier 2:</span> steel mace[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Tier 3:</span> mithril warhammer[/li]<br>
