    <title>How to protect a program?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-protect-a-program/419843</link>
    <description>This was my initial idea:

The user is given a serial they enter at the start of the program, the MAC address or something that&#39;s unique and never changes in the computer is logged, if more than one of the address is using the program at the same time, deactivate the code.

The way I would do it is something like:

1. When program starts and they type in the serial, it starts a URL connection with my website, and reads all the serials from there
2. If your serial is not on there, stop program
3. URL connect to another page, saying all the MAC addresses and serials (obfuscated of course), and if there&#39;s another MAC address using your serial, URL connect to another page with your serial which will remove it from the database.
4. If your serial is there, start another URL connection which will save your MAC address and your serial to a database
5. On program closing remove MAC and serial from the using database.

I can see many problems with that as I think it out, because it&#39;s so easy to decompile Java and change the if statements, the URL connections, etc..

I do need a way to protect this program though and I was wondering how you guys would do it.</description>

<p>No offence, but if he is seriously considering protection on his program, it would have to be good. Otherwise it wouldn’t be worth the trouble. And if it was as good as it would have to be for him to be seriously considering that, then he would be willing to spend some $ on a decent obfuscator.</p>
<p>Also, ZKM has a 30 day trial period with just a valid email and iirc it can be used to perform non standard obfuscation methods made by the user.</p>
<p>I think all of us would agree that using a free obfuscator for a professional project wouldn’t be very intelligent.</p>

Have a seperate applet program to act as a classloader and generate a numerical value from the machine info,  the day, week, month, and year and also some other variables.

              <p>Now, im modifying an already created game (which is in JAR form).</p>
<p>The way I think i’ll do this is create my own launcher, and on run create a file somewhere on the computer then launch the modified game, the game will check for the file, if it’s there continue and delete it, if not crash.<br>
I’ll hand-obfuscate and program-obfuscate the launcher, and hide multiple versions of the checker in the actual game (as everytime so far I’ve tried to program-obfuscate it it doesn’t work)</p>
<p>I can use the launcher as a serial and machine checker, because I can’t obfuscate the game (though I’ll also through it in their for extra protection)</p>
<p>I can place important variables in with the file, then in one or two areas of the game check for those variables, the game won’t run the same without them, and may even crash, meaning they must also manipulate the variables (I’ll obfuscate them then have the program unobfuscate them, meaning they much ALSO figure out what they are in order to manipulate them properly).</p>
<p>This means they must either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change the code in the launcher and in the game, removing/editing all serial checks</li>
<li>Change the code in just the game (they’ll have to change more code than number 1), removing all of the checks for the file and the serial checks.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll have it so if anything goes wrong the JAR get’s deleted and they get added to a blacklist (via URL connection).<br>
They must have a proper downloader in order to connect to the site to download the file, though they can sandboxie it and find the download of the file this will add even more protection, when connecting to the download it’ll send the machine address I choose, and if it’s not aloud it won’t download.<br>
Even if they get past the download, the blacklist will have added a file in the system, and the game and launcher will check for that file, if it’s there it will automatically crash and possibly delete itself.</p>
<p>How does this sound? It seems pretty protected to me.</p>

<li>If your serial is not on there, stop program</li>
<li>URL connect to another page, saying all the MAC addresses and serials (obfuscated of course), and if there’s another MAC address using your serial, URL connect to another page with your serial which will remove it from the database.</li>
<li>If your serial is there, start another URL connection which will save your MAC address and your serial to a database</li>
<li>On program closing remove MAC and serial from the using database.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can see many problems with that as I think it out, because it’s so easy to decompile Java and change the if statements, the URL connections, etc…</p>
<p>I do need a way to protect this program though and I was wondering how you guys would do it.</p>
