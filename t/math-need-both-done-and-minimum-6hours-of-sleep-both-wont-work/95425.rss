    <description>I need sleep, because I am taking a lot of tests tomarow(4 days of school left ;D)

However, I have worked on homework for 6 hours so far, and I need sleep or else I will be worse off, so please help me. 

I was gone for 4 days for state competitions, I am going to nationals in chicago for getting third in Intro. to technology concepts. and I have math, language arts, and science to make up in. I can handle science(got 2 more days to turn in) and I have finished language arts(must be turned in Tomarow morning) I am bobbing my head at the moment, whilst I type, and this must be turned in tomarow as well. yet I do not have time. this is a simple review and would be easy for those past 9th grade(a majority I think). so just help me by doing 2-4 questions each please.. I need help, and I do not want to ruin my GPA right at the end of the year..
