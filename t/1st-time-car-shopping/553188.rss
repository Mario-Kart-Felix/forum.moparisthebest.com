    <title>1st time car shopping</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/1st-time-car-shopping/553188</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m looking to get a new (used actually) car and this is my first time shopping for one since my first car was a gift.

So here&#39;s my run down: 

I make roughly 800-950$ a month working part time at a restaurant. My monthly expenses right now are about 400$ of that.

My car now I can get about 800$ for (Yea its a p.o.s)

I have about 3,000$ at most available for a down payment.

So I&#39;m just asking for any suggestions of my best way to go about this to come out without going absolutely broke but to get a decent vehicle. Any help is appreciated:)</description>

<p>at $400 month you really don’t want to be bogged down with car payments, buy a used car, my first car was a 1992 Honda civic I paid $800 for it had a small oil leak which destroyed the environment and cost me a quart of oil every week However the car lasted 3 years which was enough time to save money from milk moparscape for that sweet silab money and buy a 350z even if you don’t save that much money you should still be able to save at least 3 - 5k which can put you in the range of getting a new kia with low monthly payments or a decent used car to upgade too.</p>

</aside>
<p>This. Pick a civic while you save, they are reliable little cars.</p>
<p>Most US lenders won’t go above 20% debt to income for a first time auto loan, so you will probably only be able to find financing directly through one of those shady “Your job is your credit!” dealers, and stuck at like 19% interest for 7 years.</p>
<p>It sucks big time, but either save up more cash, or raise your reportable income if you want to go the route of being in debt.</p>

Lin, that actually sounds pretty rough.  How long have you had the car?<br>

<p>Just did the timing belt on my Jeep, started fraying on the highway and was half-way gone by the time I drove it home. $40 later good as new! I have a non-interference engine meaning if the belt breaks the pistons won’t hit the valves of the engine causing damage</p>

              <p>Think of it this way - you can buy a new car that you’ll have to make payments on for a very long time in addition to making a down payment, or you can buy a pretty nice used car for $3000 and put the money you’re making into improvements and maintenance. My used car was $1500 and I’ve since had to replace all the tires, the battery, the starter, the timing belt (we got very lucky with this not costing the entire engine), the back brakes, and soon, stuff related to the clutch, but just because the pedal sticks in the heat. Total, I’ve spent maybe a total of under $3k (including labor), and put about 500 miles a week on it without problems. Looking back, I paid way too much for the car and simply saving to pay for a better car would’ve resulted in having a much better vehicle, but the point is if you pay $3000 for a used car, you probably won’t have nearly the amount of issues I did and can put even more money into improving it and having something probably just as reliable as a new car.</p>

              <p>So I’m looking to get a new (used actually) car and this is my first time shopping for one since my first car was a gift.</p>
<p>So here’s my run down:</p>
<p>I make roughly 800-950$ a month working part time at a restaurant. My monthly expenses right now are about 400$ of that.</p>
<p>My car now I can get about 800$ for (Yea its a p.o.s)</p>
<p>I have about 3,000$ at most available for a down payment.</p>
<p>So I’m just asking for any suggestions of my best way to go about this to come out without going absolutely broke but to get a decent vehicle. Any help is appreciated:)</p>
