    <title>Constructive Criticism</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/constructive-criticism/314913</link>
    <description>A lot of people criticize others and a ton of people say good job, great work, that&#39;s so cool, etc. 

None of that helps to progress others through the forum and improve upon what you know. If you&#39;re going to criticize, make sure to tell them how to improve what they are doing. If you can&#39;t do that, then you obviously shouldn&#39;t be criticizing as you know nothing about the subject and should also be learning about it. For god&#39;s sake, don&#39;t go to a topic and just tell people that what they did was awful or some other synonym for the word. 

Basically, know what you&#39;re talking about before you say anything and don&#39;t criticize work if you can explain how to improve it.


inb4 tl;dr(if you say &quot;tl;dr&quot;, then this topic then you obviously don&#39;t understand the point of this and are probably one of the people that this is aimed at)</description>

And I don’t lack the intelligence to comprehend and establish that you’ve contradicted yourself withing a matter of 4 posts. You agreed that saying something as simple as “it’s bad” or “it’s good” is unacceptable. It doesn’t matter how bad it was, “It looks bad” isn’t acceptable. I don’t understand you’re logic, or lack of it. By the way, this isn’t personal at all, it’s just a great example. Happy Birthday.</p>

<p>Really cocoa, it’s a matter of whether you know it or you don’t. It’s something you learn over time, sorry but I don’t think members will learn to use CC and refrain from the bullshit you’ve talked about unless it’s been made a rule. And after it’s been made a rule, moderators insure that punishments are passed out (which I doubt will happen). Just my two cents, I’m sure you’ll agree.[/quote]<br>
Ya, I definitely agree with you about that. I think that punishments should be handed out for things like that more often. At the moment, the only punishment close to that is saying “first post”</p>

<p>I agree with this, but I think its more of a problem when people praise others when they do not know what they are talking about. In some people’s eyes over 9000 npc’s and objects spawned in one small area is “cool” or “nice” or “gj”.</p>

<p>None of that helps to progress others through the forum and improve upon what you know. If you’re going to criticize, make sure to tell them how to improve what they are doing. If you can’t do that, then you obviously shouldn’t be criticizing as you know nothing about the subject and should also be learning about it. For god’s sake, don’t go to a topic and just tell people that what they did was awful or some other synonym for the word.</p>
<p>Basically, know what you’re talking about before you say anything and don’t criticize work if you can explain how to improve it.</p>
<p>inb4 tl;dr(if you say “tl;dr”, then this topic then you obviously don’t understand the point of this and are probably one of the people that this is aimed at)</p>
