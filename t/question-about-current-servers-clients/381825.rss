    <title>Question about current servers &amp; clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-current-servers-clients/381825</link>
    <description>I&#39;m still very new to making servers I&#39;m working on a 317 right now which isn&#39;t too complicating for what I like to do. I like to move stuff around and add new monsters and change the drops and stuff and just play with a few friends. But I see the servers and clients are getting better for graphics and gameplay. I saw this new PI stuff and it looks pretty awesome but is it hard to code or is it the same as 317? I don&#39;t do anything really with clients I haven&#39;t looked into that yet.</description>
