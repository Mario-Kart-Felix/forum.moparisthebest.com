    <description>I need some help with this please.So i made my client rsps into a jar file,when i open it i can play the game but when my cousin tries to play it on his laptop,he downloads it from uppit,where your suppose to usually get ur rsps download client. It says &quot;Unable to Load/Download *myservername* Cache...(dot)(dot)(dot)&quot;. We tried extracting it and everything but still wouldnt work. We tried doing the same thing we would open up from a different servers client download.But no hope found there :( Why did it open and work on mine,but not his?We extracted it,made sure he had the latest java file which was 7.45,then we tried 7.40 and 7.25(which is what my server java is),but still doesnt work :(.

<p>It is not properly unzipping all the cache files to his C:/ or the cache download link is no longer in use. You will have to check in signlink.java to make sure its loading to C:/ and re-zip the cache and change the link in client.java</p>
