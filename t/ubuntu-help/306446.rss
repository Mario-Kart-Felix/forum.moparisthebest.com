    <description>I own a second computer I am going to use as my own personal game host. (Runescape, TMW &amp; WoW) but for now I&#39;m getting runescape up as it&#39;s the easiest of them all.

I used richscape as my base as we all know rich rocks in coding a stable source. His &quot;initializer&quot; looks like this :
[code]
@echo off
title Server
cd Source/Bin
java Server
pause[/code]

How can I put that into a .sh file? It is a very confusing task. I managed to get jre, jdk &amp; plugins for the computer after long hours of figuring out the multiverse and other crap. Now this is just confusing me. It&#39;s Ubuntu 6.06 and it doesnt have [i]Nano[/i] just text editor. Please someone expirienced in linux servers please help.</description>
