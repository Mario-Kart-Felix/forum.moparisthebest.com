    <title>Barrage Accuracy Through prayer + Freezing Time</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/barrage-accuracy-through-prayer-freezing-time/349310</link>
    <description>The server im currently using, has a few things i really need to fix, but i dont really understand how you would go about changing these.

When Barraging/Blitzing, If the other player has magic prayer enabled, Barrage hits like 1/15 times.

When Barraging/Blitzing, The time the player is frozen is near 2x the ammount it should be.

If anyone could help me with these problems i would greatly appreciate it.

And btw its a Delta.</description>
