    <title>Need someone with myBB experience and TV!</title>

    <description>I&#39;m stumped on making my website and if someone could show me how to edit some things i&#39;d more than appreciate it! I do believe its something simple such as making an html file or something but i&#39;m literally clueless. I&#39;m just trying to change portal, members, and search at the top of the screen to Webclient, Vote, and Donate and make them work. I have skype and teamviewer!</description>

              <p>go into the admin panel and look for “templates” on the left hand side. Click your template and a list should come up. Choose headers/header etc. after you clicks headers another dropdown list will appear. Click the first “header”.</p>
<p>After that you will see the code which contains your navigation bar. change to whatchya want.<br>
If I wasnt enough than just google “how to change navigation bar on mybb”</p>
