    <description>.:StoneWorld v1:.
StoneWorld is a server I am working on that is intended to take place a few years after StoneScape. The inhabitants moved unto an Island since they thought draynor was boring as fuck. Unlike StoneScape, StoneWorld will actually have quests. Unlike RuneScape these quests are ever changing and its not like npcs wait all fuking year for you to help them.

.:Is StoneWorld for me?!?:.
I am well known for making servers that are &quot;love it/hate it.&quot; This server is nothing like RuneScape, or Deltashit, I try something most people totally fail at here which is called &quot;originality.&quot;

So if you like the following
-Super duper fast money to such an extend the economy is non-existent
-Shops with every single good item thereby removing all need for player trading
-Getting max levels in a matter of an hour or 2.
-1 hitting everything that can be killed
-Getting a moderator/admin position for saying pl0x.
-A server that allows you to bot till no end.
-A server that crashes every few damn minutes
-A shitty coded laggy server (DELTA COUGH COUGH)
-Gay admins that ban you when you pk them.
-Faggot mods that mute you because they think its funny.
[u][b]THEN YOU WILL NOT LIKE STONEWORLD PERIOD.[/b][/u]

.:Features:.
[b]PVP[/b]
-If you hit your enemy hard, the enemy will go into shock for a few seconds, this [B]prevents runners.[/B]
-You are required to risk wealth (The amount you have to risk changes as the economy changes, you will always get a decent drop!) [B]This prevents 1 itemers.[/B]
-Everything in the wildy is fully recorded in explicit detail. So all cheaters will immediately be banned.
-There is TWO pking areas. One with regular pking. [B]One is spawning[/B]. So you can go to the spawning arena if you just want to have fun. If you pk in the spawning arena you obviously can&#39;t keep any of your items you get, but you will still get to keep tokkul (like pk points but can actually be used in shops...).
-PVP is slower then RS/ALL servers. The average fight lasts 3 minutes even with full DH, etc. This not only makes PVP much funnier but it also removes luck from the equation, now its actually about SKILL not LUCK.
----------------------------
[b]Economy[/b]
-This is an economy server. 
-ALL store prices adjust over time depending on supply/demand. So if lobsters are constantly being bought, and hardly being sold, the server auto adjusts to a higher price.
-All trades and chat are recorded with explicit details, scammers are easily weeded out.
-No dupes, No trade bugs.
-Dynamic Drops: Monsters drop exactly what you need based on your particular level. For example if you kill Fire Mages, if you lvl 1 magic they drop 1 fire runes, if your level 100 magic, they drop 100 fire runes.
-----------------------------
[b]Skills[/b]
-Fishing
-Cooking
-ALL COMBAT (including prayer)*
-Herblore
-Guile*
-Woodcutting
-Fletching*
-Mining*
-Smithing*
*= StoneWorld orignality, AKA nothing like RS.
------------------------------
[b]Combat[/b]
-EXP is relatively fast and drops are very good.

-Unlike ALL servers AND RS you have to click on the spell then on the NPC/player assuming you want to pull off a quick spell. I added locking on which allows you to do spells and actions without STOPPING combat. 

-When you die, you will be paralyzed for 30 seconds before being able to move. This prevents you from going back and picking up your items before they are visible (before there was NO risk for death because its a small area). 

-Food heals significantly more then RS. Why? Because the way it was before you are able to kill someone in a matter of 2 seconds or so. Thats not skill as the other player had no chance to defend himself. Its like stabbing someone in the back oo pwned i gotz skiLz!, no brah you don&#39;t its easy to 1/2 hit someone, just look at all the sigs on google.
------------------------------
[b]Macros/Rules[/b]
-Auto talkers are allowed IF USED IN MODERATION. ALL other macros used for skills/combat are EASILY detected by the SWC engine and you will get banned after a day or so (I always like to wait so you cheaters feel you are winning, then BAM mass ban.)

In the last StoneScape, over 1000 people tried to macro and failed miserably. I have the most effective random events and YOU WILL GET CAUGHT. I know there are still plenty of you who will try.

-There are two rules, Respect everyone and play fair. 

-Punishments. Because there is no message centre and not many people visit the website, it is unfair most of the time to flat out ban someone. Instead I came up with these punishments instead.

-Cursing, disruptive language, etc: 24 hour mute, no marks against the account. The account WILL be warned first before muted.

-Spamming with an auto talker 48 hour mute, no marks against the account.

-Spam advertising another server, IP ban. These guys are nothing but a waste of space.

-Macroing: Account will be reverted back to before you began macroing. 1 week ban on all trading, including stores, dropping, PVP, and you shall be muted aswell. The second time you will be banned.

-Scamming, all items will be returned to rightful owner, the player will be permemently banned from all trading (including store and dropping). If the scam involved the wildy, you will be perm banned from PVP.

-Being a dick: Honestly I hate when people are dicks to others. You will be muted for 48 hours for the first time, there wont be a second time. YOU WILL RECEIVE A WARNING FIRST, sometimes people don&#39;t realize they are being a dick so you will be warned first.

.:BETA testers:.
-Anyone who was rejected for ALPHA will automatically be put in BETA. So you WILL get to play early.

BETA will begin on 12/1/09. Server OPENS TO PUBLIC 12/12/09 (unless serious issues come up.

.:HOW UPDATING WORKS:.
Once I complete a build, I run it on the ALPHA server for testing, once we crunch the bugs that come, I move it on to the BETA server. Once the BETA server is done testing, it goes to PUBLIC.

This princlipel will continue after the server has been released. Say I add the slayer skill. First alpha tests it for a week or so, then BETA, for a week or so, then it goes to PUBLIC.

This means major add ons will come every few WEEKS. In the meantime small patches and fixes will come about. This Guarantees that updates will have no bugs, and no impact on performance.  

Once the server is public anyone can jump on the Alpha/Beta servers but none of their stats will transfer over. Naturally curious people will want to see the latest of the latest will test it out and I may decide on a reward system at a later date.


.:Stability and UPTIME:.
Unlike most server owners, I&#39;m not full of shit. There is no such thing as a 24/7 server, even the RS ones crash from time to time. I will be getting 3 dedicated servers. 2 in Florida, 1 in Wisconsin. Details will surface later but I intend to run it in 24/7 (expect crashes, etc). 

StoneWorld was coded nearly from scratch by ME, Stone Warior. So it is extremely stable and has never, EVER crashed. However once we get a few Alpha testers we can find a few more crashes, which can easily be fixed by repairing the fucked up code.  (crazy huh, if you actually fix your server you wont need auto restarters).

PICTURES/GIFs below.

Anti-Stuck:
[img]http://i36.tinypic.com/2rggkkk.png[/img]
This prevents accounts from getting stuck if their client crashes. If they don&#39;t respond in 30 seconds, it will automatically disconnect them completely from the game. Preventing them from having to wait till the server is reset.[/SPOILER]

PVP DEMONSTRATION:

A new player after about 5 minutes on rock crabs:

REVOLUTIONARY StoneWorld Magic:
[img]http://i37.tinypic.com/33cydlh.png[/img]
Because Magic is a side skill, it will allow players who train it to achieve double hits, very good for KOing. This Magic system is similar to RSC.

-Super duper fast money to such an extend the economy is non-existent<br>
-Shops with every single good item thereby removing all need for player trading<br>
-Getting max levels in a matter of an hour or 2.<br>
-1 hitting everything that can be killed<br>
-Getting a moderator/admin position for saying pl0x.<br>
-A server that allows you to bot till no end.<br>
-A server that crashes every few damn minutes<br>
-A shitty coded laggy server (DELTA COUGH COUGH)<br>
-Gay admins that ban you when you pk them.<br>
-Faggot mods that mute you because they think its funny.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">THEN YOU WILL NOT LIKE STONEWORLD PERIOD.</span></span></p>
<h2>.:Features:.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">PVP</span><br>
-If you hit your enemy hard, the enemy will go into shock for a few seconds, this <span class="bbcode-b">prevents runners.</span><br>
-You are required to risk wealth (The amount you have to risk changes as the economy changes, you will always get a decent drop!) <span class="bbcode-b">This prevents 1 itemers.</span><br>
-Everything in the wildy is fully recorded in explicit detail. So all cheaters will immediately be banned.<br>
-There is TWO pking areas. One with regular pking. <span class="bbcode-b">One is spawning</span>. So you can go to the spawning arena if you just want to have fun. If you pk in the spawning arena you obviously can’t keep any of your items you get, but you will still get to keep tokkul (like pk points but can actually be used in shops…).<br>
-PVP is slower then RS/ALL servers. The average fight lasts 3 minutes even with full DH, etc. This not only makes PVP much funnier but it also removes luck from the equation, now its actually about SKILL not LUCK.</h2>
<h2>
<span class="bbcode-b">Economy</span><br>
-This is an economy server.<br>
-ALL store prices adjust over time depending on supply/demand. So if lobsters are constantly being bought, and hardly being sold, the server auto adjusts to a higher price.<br>
-All trades and chat are recorded with explicit details, scammers are easily weeded out.<br>
-No dupes, No trade bugs.<br>
-Dynamic Drops: Monsters drop exactly what you need based on your particular level. For example if you kill Fire Mages, if you lvl 1 magic they drop 1 fire runes, if your level 100 magic, they drop 100 fire runes.</h2>
<h2>
<span class="bbcode-b">Skills</span><br>
-Fishing<br>
-Cooking<br>
-ALL COMBAT (including prayer)*<br>
-Herblore<br>
-Guile*<br>
-Woodcutting<br>
-Fletching*<br>
-Mining*<br>
-Smithing*<br>
*= StoneWorld orignality, AKA nothing like RS.</h2>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Combat</span><br>
-EXP is relatively fast and drops are very good.</p>
<p>-Unlike ALL servers AND RS you have to click on the spell then on the NPC/player assuming you want to pull off a quick spell. I added locking on which allows you to do spells and actions without STOPPING combat.</p>
<p>-When you die, you will be paralyzed for 30 seconds before being able to move. This prevents you from going back and picking up your items before they are visible (before there was NO risk for death because its a small area).</p>
<h2>-Food heals significantly more then RS. Why? Because the way it was before you are able to kill someone in a matter of 2 seconds or so. Thats not skill as the other player had no chance to defend himself. Its like stabbing someone in the back oo pwned i gotz skiLz!, no brah you don’t its easy to 1/2 hit someone, just look at all the sigs on google.</h2>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Macros/Rules</span><br>
-Auto talkers are allowed IF USED IN MODERATION. ALL other macros used for skills/combat are EASILY detected by the SWC engine and you will get banned after a day or so (I always like to wait so you cheaters feel you are winning, then BAM mass ban.)</p>
<p>In the last StoneScape, over 1000 people tried to macro and failed miserably. I have the most effective random events and YOU WILL GET CAUGHT. I know there are still plenty of you who will try.</p>
<p>-There are two rules, Respect everyone and play fair.</p>
<p>-Punishments. Because there is no message centre and not many people visit the website, it is unfair most of the time to flat out ban someone. Instead I came up with these punishments instead.</p>
<p>-Cursing, disruptive language, etc: 24 hour mute, no marks against the account. The account WILL be warned first before muted.</p>
<p>-Spamming with an auto talker 48 hour mute, no marks against the account.</p>
<p>-Spam advertising another server, IP ban. These guys are nothing but a waste of space.</p>
<p>-Macroing: Account will be reverted back to before you began macroing. 1 week ban on all trading, including stores, dropping, PVP, and you shall be muted aswell. The second time you will be banned.</p>
<p>-Scamming, all items will be returned to rightful owner, the player will be permemently banned from all trading (including store and dropping). If the scam involved the wildy, you will be perm banned from PVP.</p>
<h2>-Being a dick: Honestly I hate when people are dicks to others. You will be muted for 48 hours for the first time, there wont be a second time. YOU WILL RECEIVE A WARNING FIRST, sometimes people don’t realize they are being a dick so you will be warned first.</h2>
<p>.:]SIGNUP:.<br>
SIGNUP IS HERE: <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHVpYmgyaHFFMkRGcy1sVV9kaEFiTHc6MA" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHVpYmgyaHFFMkRGcy1sVV9kaEFiTHc6MA</a></p>
<p>.:BETA testers:.<br>
-Anyone who was rejected for ALPHA will automatically be put in BETA. So you WILL get to play early.</p>
<p>BETA will begin on 12/1/09. Server OPENS TO PUBLIC 12/12/09 (unless serious issues come up.</p>
<p>.:HOW UPDATING WORKS:.<br>
Once I complete a build, I run it on the ALPHA server for testing, once we crunch the bugs that come, I move it on to the BETA server. Once the BETA server is done testing, it goes to PUBLIC.</p>
<p>This princlipel will continue after the server has been released. Say I add the slayer skill. First alpha tests it for a week or so, then BETA, for a week or so, then it goes to PUBLIC.</p>
<p>This means major add ons will come every few WEEKS. In the meantime small patches and fixes will come about. This Guarantees that updates will have no bugs, and no impact on performance.</p>
<p>Once the server is public anyone can jump on the Alpha/Beta servers but none of their stats will transfer over. Naturally curious people will want to see the latest of the latest will test it out and I may decide on a reward system at a later date.</p>
<p>.:Stability and UPTIME:.<br>
Unlike most server owners, I’m not full of shit. There is no such thing as a 24/7 server, even the RS ones crash from time to time. I will be getting 3 dedicated servers. 2 in Florida, 1 in Wisconsin. Details will surface later but I intend to run it in 24/7 (expect crashes, etc).</p>
<p>StoneWorld was coded nearly from scratch by ME, Stone Warior. So it is extremely stable and has never, EVER crashed. However once we get a few Alpha testers we can find a few more crashes, which can easily be fixed by repairing the fucked up code.  (crazy huh, if you actually fix your server you wont need auto restarters).</p>

<p>Anti-Stuck:<br>

This prevents accounts from getting stuck if their client crashes. If they don’t respond in 30 seconds, it will automatically disconnect them completely from the game. Preventing them from having to wait till the server is reset.[/SPOILER]</p>

Because Magic is a side skill, it will allow players who train it to achieve double hits, very good for KOing. This Magic system is similar to RSC.</p>
