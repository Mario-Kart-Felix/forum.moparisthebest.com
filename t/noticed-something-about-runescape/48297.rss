    <title>Noticed something about RuneScape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/noticed-something-about-runescape/48297</link>
    <description>I have tested this and found it to be true:
RuneScape claims that they have a &#39;state-of-the-art&#39; hacker prevention system. Wanna know what it is?
Randoms...
After missing a certian number of randoms (such as frogs) they will claim to say you were &#39;AFK Training&#39;. Breaking rule 7 and getting 7.5 or 10 full blackmarks on your account.
Frogs are unique, as you miss or run away from more randoms, they happen MUCH more often then if you actualy talk to the randoms and solve their puzzles. Vefore my members expedition I had never recieved a frog random, in the almost five years that I have been playing. I became a member and well, I recieved a frog random just about every other day it seems. 
Has anyone else noticed this?</description>

<p>Have you seen this for yourself?  You could always make the argument that you hate randoms and tried boycotting them.</p>

Well first of all, frogs have not been in the game for 5 years, probably like ~1 year because they came with the big aryan craze.</p>

<p>And we all knew that randoms were for stopping bots and stuff. They say in the updates that they are for stopping cheaters. They didnt just make them for people to have “fun”. They are annoying as hell whether your actually cheating or not.</p>

              <p>I guess you are more likely to encounter certain randoms with different [member] activities.  Never really played rs2 on members though so I don’t know much else about it.</p>
<p>I will move this to RS discussion though.</p>
