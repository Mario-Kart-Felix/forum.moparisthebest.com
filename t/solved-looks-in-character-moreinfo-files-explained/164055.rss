    <title>[SOLVED] Looks in Character/Moreinfo files - Explained</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solved-looks-in-character-moreinfo-files-explained/164055</link>
    <description>Hi.
I have recently decided to modify the way my server saves character information / server settings / etc. On My computer.
I am currently making a new class which will load character information from a MySQL Database. The database is set up with test information, and so far the java works. My problem is, I&#39;ve come to the [LOOKS] part in the /moreinfo/ files, and its really confusing. I was hoping to stop saving all unnessicery data, and Having 5 blocks all reading the same thing seems unnessicery to me. If someone knows, I would greatly appreciate them letting me know what the deal is with saving character looks.

Thanks,
Ben Corbett

              <p>Thanks, but its not really what i was after…</p>
<p>After a while of studying my client.java, I found what each variable does:</p>
<p>• playerLook[0] - Gender<br>
• playerLook[1] - Hair Colour<br>
• playerLook[2] - Torso (Shirt) Colour<br>
• playerLook[3] - Legs (Pants) Colour<br>
• playerLook[4] - Shoe Colour<br>
• playerLook[5] - SKin Colour</p>
<p>• pHead - Head Style<br>
• pBeard - Jaw Style<br>
• pTorso - Torso Style<br>
• pArms - Arm Style<br>
• pHands - Hands Style<br>
• pLegs - Legs Style<br>
• pFeet - Feet Style</p>
<p>I know how, but I still don’t know why the pHead, pBeard stuff is repeated in my moreinfo files though. =\</p>
