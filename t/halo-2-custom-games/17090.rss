    <title>Halo 2 Custom Games</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/halo-2-custom-games/17090</link>
    <description>Well as anyone who plays halo 2 would know, you can make your own custom games with its own rules to play split screen with. I decided to share a few of my favourites.

Tower Power: This game needs 4 or more people, preferably even teams.

If you have the people, and play this on asention,(sp) imo this game is awesome.

Turn off grenades and weapons on map. Turn off banshees, ghosts etc.

starting weapons is a shotty and plasma sword.

Make ONE machine gun turret. This will go in the biggest tower.

Use your common sense to get the rest of the rules.

The main object is to control the tower, because that is when you will get the most kills. You have a turret and can gun down people trying to get into the tower. And they can do nothing but try and get up there because they only have short range weapons. A stratagy i like to do is have someone on the turret, and someone protecting him, when someone gets in the tower the gunner gets off and the two try and kill the invader.

Some Stratagies:
When defending the tower, stand in the window behind the gunner looking down with your sword out, when they run up they wont see you unles they look directly up. After they are past you then lock on and attack him. You will charge at him and kill in one hit because its from behind.

When attacking the tower:
The best way in is going to the place wher the banshee normally spawns, and going the back way into the tower. The gunner cant attack you this way. When you get near the top look up when you go under uncase someone is using the stratagy I had above, the sword is best here.

Also, when you go around the second last corner, (right ahead of you is a good place for defenders) jump out almost over the edge facing them, and use the lock on with the sword to attack them, since you jump towards the edge you will catch them by surprise.
This game relies heavily on teamwork.


Game 2: Invisible (for want of a better name)

This game is best played on ivery tower.

Have no weapons on map, but genades, and you start with 2 random weapons.
Players are invisible, have damage resistence and overshields.
Again, use your common sense to figure out the rest of the rules, these are the main ones.

One player might get a sword, and keep owning, until someone gets a plasma pistol, a charged shot takes out their shield entirely, and any weapon can kill him in a couple shots.
There is also rocket launcher ammo in this map near the middle.


If anyone has their own custom game they think is good then post it here.</description>
