<p>About 20 percent of players pay.</p>
<p>so lets say 2 million accounts? $10 million+ advertisements etc. x 12 months.</p>
<p>120 million a year? - 500 employees averaging around 40k a year.</p>
<p>120 million - 20 million = 100 million to pay for servers, buildings, computers, electricity, water, food, events, etc.</p>
<p>What we should do… is everyone cancel membership for one month to see jagex reaction. “Oh shit all our members left, what we do?!?”</p>

<p>Of course, I don’t have a source but those numbers seem about right.</p>
<p>edit: I found where they said that close to 200 million accounts have been created:</p>
<blockquote>Q. Why do you put a limit on the amount of bank space we can have? 
<p>A. There are technical limitations when it comes to saving the data on the server – <span class="bbcode-b">remember that we have close to 200 million accounts with data saved, therefore some limitations are needed.</span> Managing your bank has since become part of the everyday experience in RuneScape and we won’t take that away but we are always open for additional ideas as to store items.<br>
