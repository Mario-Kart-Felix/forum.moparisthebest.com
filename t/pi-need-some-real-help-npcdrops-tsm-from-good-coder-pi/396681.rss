how would i make it to where something drops everytime, but rare&#39;r items dont?
like ashes 100%/ and 3%claws or something?? Some people say top row = common, bottom = rare and other say its the opposite? which one? this is a [pi] under NPCdrops.TSM  .. + this is what i hear below

#Lesser Demon  &lt;-----name
82:30		995:1300		15039:1
	15040:1 &lt;-- idk

[NPC ID] : [rarity] --tab-- [item id] : [item quantity]  --then put all the items that you want?? but its wierd cuz its an or. like if you have 2 things, its 1 or the other? and idk what bottom row is. I put a code in the bottom/compile/restart and it drops at the same rate as the top? --can someone that knows what their doing help? i know a lot of people are stuck on this =/  -thanks</description>

              <p>Heh, you posted this over a month ago and nobody posted back? Can’t stand that… I registered to this forum just right now to help you.</p>
<p>100% drops are not in NPCDROPS.TSM</p>
<p>They are located in: NPCCONSTANT.TSM</p>
<p>Now then… I’m going to explain the full thing…</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Man</span> drops (For example - Whats shown here is everything he will have 1% at ever dropping)<br>
NOTE: If you have one item/rarity he seems to NOT drop anything! So do not go by this one alone!!!)<br>
1:1	995:100	554:100</p>
<p>If we want him to drop items of a different rarity, you can just add more lines!<br>
(We’ll use bronze sword for example. (Item ID: 1277))</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#Man</span> drops<br>
1:1	995:100	554:100<br>
1:50  1277:1</p>
<p>Now they have a 50% at dropping bronze swords too and he will drop 1 of them when the time comes, and it basically causes a clash I suppose… 50% to bronze sword to 1% either the fire runes or the money and 49% him dropping nothing.</p>
<p>Now then… How NPCconstants.TSM works…</p>
<p>You open it… And all you see is 1-4 lines vertically. We’ll use Level-2 Man (ID: 1) again as an example…</p>
<p>1	526</p>
<p>Quite simple, right? No % or anything needed! He will always drop 526 (Regular bones)</p>
<p>Also, as a bonus tip… We know Dragons drop bones and hides…</p>
<p>Thats where the line amounts go up, you just press ‘tab’ and add more items.</p>
<p>Hopefully after this time you get a chance to read this and still have use of it.</p>
<p>[P.S. To potential flamers, I didn’t use the code option cause this was all metaphorical. Its answered now for everyone to see]</p>
