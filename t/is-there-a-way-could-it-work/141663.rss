    <title>Is there a way? could it work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-a-way-could-it-work/141663</link>
    <description>hi i was woundering if theres any psp coders and java coders around here, i know loads of people asking can i get runescape on psp, obviouslly no, but then it came to me, what if you could get Moparscape on psp? i mean if you took out all the other citys and left in lumby and vorrock, took out all the quests, recode the controls etc, and im sure moparscape could run on psp using the runtime enviroment homebrew application, im sure it can work, someone got windows 98 and 95 to work on psp, but it took 10 minutes to boot up, but it did work, so im possitive this could work, if it dosnt, you could use the rsc source, that should work. apart from that i only can play runescape/moparscape on my psp by using vnc (allows u to control ur pc).

so is there any psp coders, moparscape heroes out there?

this wont work on any ordinary psp, it has to be homebrew enabled.[br][size=1]Posted on: September 09, 2007, 04:44:04 AM[/size][hr]also the psp has 32mb ram.</description>
