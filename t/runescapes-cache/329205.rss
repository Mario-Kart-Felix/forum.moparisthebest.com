    <title>RuneScapes Cache</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescapes-cache/329205</link>
    <description>While messing around watching youtube video&#39;s I found one about the new slayer master on runescape, and the video was from December, way before the update took place.

Link of the new Wise Old Man: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raStb029gZs

Now, is it possible(I don&#39;t know how to do it) To go into RuneScapes Cache and go threw to see if you can possibly find a Npc with the new skillcape on it? Since it appears Jagex is already planning for the future by adding this stuff in already.</description>

for some things yes they sometimes slip things in accidently, for example in the 590 cache there is a unreleased itemdefition although the definition is incomplete you can see some of the data. it is also possible that they simply removed this item and will not be returning it. I am not a mind reader.</p>
