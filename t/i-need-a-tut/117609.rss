    <description>i need a tut on the following

problem: way to many massers in my server, ive spent 3-4 days coding it, and i dont want it to be ruined because some people like to mass, so can somebody PLEASE give me something that auto kicks them or something or gives them warnings if they click over a certain speed?

problem:way too many massers
