    <title>[Delta] Mining</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-mining/460672</link>
    <description>Wasn&#39;t sure what to make the title other than just mining.. If someone wouldn&#39;t mind could they post their mining actionHandler. Such as..
[code]
case ####:
//MINING STUFF HERE
break;
[/code]

Not sure what they are for various rock types, and what the correct code to put inbetween the case and break; is. The reason being is that I downloaded a blank source and it doesn&#39;t have anything, I&#39;ve been working hard to add everything, using a clean system. However, I have no idea how to go about starting mining.

Delta please, thanks! - The Web Guy.</description>

Also, read up on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">switch statements</a>, so you can better understand exactly what the case: and break; is.</p>

<p>Did something very similar with Woodcutting, I’ll take your advice into consideration, thanks Zyle.</p>
