    <title>How do I make Veng require 45 defence?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-veng-require-45-defence/356308</link>
    <description>Hey I&#39;ve almost finished my Server and it&#39;s looking pretty neat, Only one problem left. (Well two but this is my biggest)

How do I make it so that Vengeance requires 45 defence to use?
ATM 1 Defence Pures can use it and it looks messy.

Also if anyone could tell me how to change how long Barrage freezes for that&#39;ld be great. I know it&#39;s got something to do with the FreezeTimer but all I see is a &#39;1&#39; next to it and not like, 30 seconds for example.</description>
