    <title>Any idea on how to make your runserver.bat be able to do commands?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any-idea-on-how-to-make-your-runserver-bat-be-able-to-do-commands/309511</link>
    <description>Does anyone here know if it&#39;s possible to make your run.bat batch file be able to follow through commands like give a player admin/mod or even kick/ban someone without being logged into the server? :) If so, thank you! Very much...

But - If you think it&#39;s pretty damn complicated, just tell me. I don&#39;t really need it. So, if you can give me a general idea of how i might go about doing that, thanks! A bunch! :)</description>
