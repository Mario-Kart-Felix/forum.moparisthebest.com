    <description>Howdy,

Now correct me if i am wrong but would it be extreamly easy to creat a script to autorun the Nome Stronghold Agility Course, Wouldnt it be simple color replacement and a few move here and click here commands? :confused:

If anyone has a old script for agility laying around that does or does not work please post here so i can study them :)

Ok ok i have now found a agility trainer for the stronghold but it seems no to work maybe you guys wanna take a look at it, the scripting seems fine and i can not debug it at all,

TYVM,
Blackhat  :P[br][size=1]Posted at: April 01, 2006, 07:48:13 pm[/size][hr]Ok,

I now have a new one, That compiles fine, And starts to work!!!

But then makes RS freeze...

And when i stop SCAR, RS starts up again ??

Any ideas? ill post this new Working Agility trainer here to.

Cheers,

here i found a fully working 100% gnome agility trainer special thanks to GenoDemon (I have nothing to do with this). It is free but you can not sell it ever! acording to GenoDemons terms, so respect them. :)

NO-AntiRandoms, not really needed though

Make sure you set the color of MUD or you will just Spin outa control after the pipes!!
