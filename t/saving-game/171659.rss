    <description>Ok, i am starting over, i used to use a testscape source that i stripped down but i recently found a nice basic source, that is baiscally all i tried to do with my testscape source. So, i am trying to add auto save and inactive kicker but i cannot figure out how to save, i think it is something like this 
[code]
PlayerSave tempSave = new PlayerSave(Player.Player(playerId));
[/code]
but it says
[code]
client.java:58: cannot find symbol
symbol  : method Player(int)
location: class Player
PlayerSave tempSave = new PlayerSave(Player.Player(playerId));
                                           ^
Note: stream.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.
1 error
Press any key to continue . . .
[/code]
but yea, in the player.java file, it has this
[code]
	public Player(int _playerId) {
		playerId = _playerId;
		//playerName = &quot;player&quot;+playerId;
		playerRights = 0; //pelaajantila
....
....
....
[/code]

I am assuming this is easy enough and you dont need much else. So thanks in advanced.</description>
