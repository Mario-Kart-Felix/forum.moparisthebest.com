    <title>Problems with Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-server/347810</link>
    <description>Currently I am using Adel&#39;s Server or MetallicScape Server 508.
Heres the Problem everything from what i can tell works fine except the Grand exchange.
Well sorta the GE works like 90%. Anyway the problem is when you purchase something from the GE and you go to retrieve it from the GE the client logs out?
Looked for tuts on here and on the net. Cant find a thing any advice or answears as to why this may be happening?

Thanks in advance
hope someone can help with this problem.</description>
