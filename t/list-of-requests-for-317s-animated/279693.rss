              <p>i know how to animate a skillcape properly but its super confusing, mainly because there are so many different priorities put in not to mention the tskin and vskin1 numbers as well,<br>
all these jumbled up makes it REALLY confusing to tell which face has which value and what not.<br>
so your cape might be hard to get.</p>
