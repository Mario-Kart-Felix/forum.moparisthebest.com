    <description>Is there any point in me running a server if i&#39;m on a dial up? i&#39;d pay for a dedi and all but just the fact that i&#39;m on dial up with a pretty crappy computer and my ip constantly changes etc.. would i be able to achieve it  with these cons.. :S because i have alot of good new ideas for rsc.</description>

<p>Why do you type so annoying, it’s hurting my eyes when I read.<br>
Have you ever heard of new paragraphs, or full stops, capitals or proper english?</p>

              <p>i currently find and play rsce the best one so far and closest to what i like tbh, but i’d like to see a server with mini games and maybe shops close by so it’s easier to walk and possibly for that a whole map change near the edge like create shops around the border instead of having to go to varrok but acually create the buildings if thats possible and possibly getting rid of parts of maps and changing colours of things and jus like sprite editting and easier ways of getting money but the rsce exp rate is perfect. maybe no dueling so more pking becus tbh dueling sucks no effort required <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> umm cut the wilderness down abit and possibly edit it to make it smaller but also like make it so u walk in from border into lvl 4 wilderness and it goes up by a few lvls… this is jus little things id do if i had a server… i know how to make one and do all this… well exept map editting etc but i’d learn quick if i tried… but i cant host one as u said considering my dial up and comp speed etc i’d try but i dont wanna waste money on a dedi unless theres cheap dedi’s… wat are they ranging from? theres so many ideas i’ve got tbh… 1 of the biggest things i’d like to be able to do is change like the way the characters look and the way they hit stuff and that etc… yehh.</p>

              <p>thanks for the advice kryptix, i think i jus need more ram on my computer and it should be fine… but i live in an area where broadband isnt available without a satellite would that be okay? how much is a cheap dedi…? i’d rather personally jus go play a server but no servers i’ve found have the right idea im looking for… :S this is random but… i wonder if jagex still has there source and i wonder how much it would cost… i imagine like millions… they wouldnt sell it though…</p>
