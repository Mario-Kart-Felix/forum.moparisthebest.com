        <p>Well, I did think before posting this, or even writing it, “Is this a good idea or not?”. So I was hoping some of the more mature members of the community could answer a few questions for me.</p>
<ol>
<li>If I beat some dudes ass to a pulp, will I go jail?</li>
<li>Is it right to beat some dudes ass to a pulp if he ‘attempts’ to rape my friend?</li>
<li>Will the FBI show up at my door for posting about beating some dudes ass to a pulp?</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, that I have the questions there, I should explain a bit to why I’m asking them, right? My friend(16 years old, female), is dating some faggot(age 15, male). She only dates him because he has liked her for several years. She does NOT know that he hangs out with the 4 biggest nerds in the school to talk about Runescape, then go home and go on the Runescape forums and talk more about Runescape, then play Runescape for the rest of the day. Now, he is a football player, he works out during practice(sometimes, I barley see him at practice. The freshmen show up more than he does), he has played one time this entire season, for one play, his jersey is so clean. Well, they’ve been dating for a month or so now, and I’ve known them both for 2-ish years(i know her better though, i don’t like him very much).<br>
Well, she has planned to wait till marriage to have sex, and she told him that. He told her the same thing. Ever since then, I have noticed him bringing up that topic a lot, and he tells her that he will marry her one day. A few days later at an assembly, some guy comes in and talks about how Drugs and Alcohol is bad, and tells us Condoms and Preg. Pills don’t work(GG. Tell us something new?). Well, he brings up the topic once again during the assembly, and I was sitting right behind them, so I had a chance to listen. He pushes her and pushes her to have sex with him, right? Then he tells her, even if she got preg. he would support this baby and take care of her(with some kind of freaky look in his eyes). So being a girl in love(or is it love?), she says she wants to have sex with him, but she will wait. This makes him VERY unhappy. Last night she showed up at my front door damn near naked, crying, with bruises on her arms.<br>
She tells me a story which I shall not repeat, but she was lucky to get away without any harm done. Today at school I planned to crack his skull; Unfortunately, he was not there. Now she is pleading I don’t do anything to him for I will go to prison, which I have no doubt will happen(or at least if he doesn’t hit me back, right?).</p>
<p>Is it worth it? Destroy him and go to jail for 15-ish years, or don’t do anything and let him do it again? Hes just some desperate nerd wanting to get laid, and when he doesn’t he tries to rape the girl. I’ve told the police, showed the bruises on her arms, but no real-evidence ties him to the assault. So they do nothing.</p>

        <p>Cracking his skull open? Yes, you will go to some sort of jail or detention center. Beating the shit out of him, you are more likely to be excluded from school for a week. The police may get involved, but nothing like going to jail or anything. Certainly the FBI wont get involved. It will more likely to be the local cops. I’m also sure, once you tell them about the whole attempted rape, they’ll go after this pervert kid.</p>
<p>Anyway, goodluck with it. Nothing more satisfying the beating some guy who deserves it, right?</p>

        <p>Umm… I think it would be ridiculously idiotic to beat this kid up. I mean just like you said, he’s just a nerd who wants to get laid. I’d walk up to him and tell him to grow up or fuck off from your friend (ie <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=GTFO" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">gtfo</a>). Obviously this girl isn’t gonna go out with him anymore, so they should probably stay as far from each other as possible. Maybe you can even get a judicial order stating he must stay a certain distance from her (if anything like this happens again).</p>

        <p>Well, Mr.Chris. Its not quite that simple, I’ve told the police. They told me theres nothing tying him to this ‘attempted’ rape, so they won’t do anything. And yes, I would love to beat the hell out of his pampered ass.</p>
<p>Error, Yes, its American Football. Even if I beat his ass during the night he would know I did it. Besides, I would want the entire 10th and 11th grade to watch him get his ass beat.</p>
<p>Rictoo, that is a possibility. But why would I let him get away with it? Would you let him get away with it?</p>

<ol>
<li>Yes, fighting and hitting someone is assault. It’s a felony and if you’re caught you’ll very likely go to jail.</li>
<li>Yes, it’s right but it’s not very smart.</li>
<li>No, they FBI won’t show up at your door.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not sure what the story was but it seems like the guy tried to rape your friend (obviously). Normally I would say for her to press charges, however, rape cases are always quite hard to prove. There doesn’t seem to be any “solid” evidence other than her story and her showing up at your door. If she wants to press charges though, I guess she can try.</p>
<p>As for you, I wouldn’t fight at school. You run the risk of being kicked out of school and just trust me when I say it’s not worth it. Even outside of school, you shouldn’t do anything. The consequences for doing that could be far more severe than you can imagine.</p>

        <p>…start a rumor? I’m not 10, and I’m not a girl, no thanks.</p>
<p>Shizzo, I do think she could press charges, but I do have an idea of what would happen if he didn’t hit me back(unless he hits me 2 times, its assault). If he doesn’t hit me, I get 4.5 months out of school, 350hours of community service, and 1yr juvy(big fight in the 6th grade left me to these punishments). At my current age, I would approx. half the year out of school(or everyday cut in half?), 600-800hours community service, 1-2years in Juvy(or until I’m 18).</p>

        <p>Alright to be quite honest with you I have been in a very similar situation before. I will explain.</p>
<p>Well, A couple years ago I was dating a girl(we will call her Nicole) and she had a little sister(we will call her Kate), who I thought of as a little sister myself. Well Kate was dating a real fagot, Mike, who I couldn’t stand as he was a total douche bag. Well, a long story short, Kate came to her sister crying and suicidal, and told her that Mike raped her and not to tell anyone. Well, Nicole called me and I came over. She then told me what had happened, so I was pissed I went downstairs and told their dad I was using his truck, he saw that I was pissed off and he let me use it. I drove over to Mike’s house wondering how I should proceed in killing him. I got to his house walked up to the door and heard his dad(a police officer mind you) yelling at him. I knocked on the door and Mike answered it, he mouthed something but I didn’t listen I just opened up on him and started wailing on him. The rest of the fight is pretty a blur but his dad never pulled me off of him and his mother called the cops who pulled me off of him when they got there. After spending a few nights in jail I went to court where his dad (yes Mike’s dad) testified against him. The judge let me off with something like 120 hours of community service and $5,000 fine. Mike was hospitalized for two months with three broken ribs and his jaw broken in two different spots.</p>
<p>So back to the point, you will most likely goto jail. But in my opinion if he attempted to rape someone chances are he will try again and the police won’t do anything about it until someone gets hurt. And 3) no the FBI won’t show up for something like that.</p>

        <p>I see from your profile that you’re 17, same age as me. So I’m guessing you’re pretty close to graduating from high school. When it comes down to it, it’s simply not worth it. I totally understand why you’d want to kick the guy’s ass. I’d love to do the same thing if I were you, but the negatives outweigh the positives in this situation. Even if you do beat the guy really bad, he’ll be in the hospital for a few months and eventually heal and get out. You’ll be sitting it juvenile or jail, miserable, possibly for an extended period of time. You’ll have a criminal record (if you don’t already), and you’ll have to stay in school longer.  Fighting here just isn’t the solution. While it might give you temporary satisfaction, it could cause so many, many more problems as well.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do is just be there from your friend and make sure that the guy doesn’t go near her. Just give her support and if she decides to press charges make sure you help as much as you can with that.</p>

<p>Shizzo, shes mad at me enough for posting this on the internet, you should see her face. Well, shes taking him to court in a week. So for the next week(even as strict as her parents are), she is staying over at my house until this blows over. If I’m correct, sexual assault is 10yr+ right? Even for a 15yr old? He’d best hope he sucks off the judge before court.</p>

        <p>Well it’s great the she’s pressing charges, best of luck with that. As far as time for the charges, I’m not exactly sure how long the average sentence is. I’m pretty sure that once your friend talks it over with an attorney, he’ll be getting charged with more than one thing. The amount of time he gets will very likely be the judges decision.</p>

Sexual Assault<br>

Probably more, but thats all I can think of what he did. So at least 5yrs.</p>

        <p>Hmm, Well depending on the Judge he could get charged as an adult but I highly doubt it due to them both being 15. But it also does depend on the degree of the assault; not to mention if/when he gets charged he will have to register as a sex offender the rest of his life. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Of course if there were a plea bargain for a lesser charge than he might not have to.</p>
