    <title>Hmm..?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hmm/148696</link>
    <description>  Well, I did think before posting this, or even writing it, &quot;Is this a good idea or not?&quot;. So I was hoping some of the more mature members of the community could answer a few questions for me.

1) If I beat some dudes ass to a pulp, will I go jail?
2) Is it right to beat some dudes ass to a pulp if he &#39;attempts&#39; to rape my friend?
3) Will the FBI show up at my door for posting about beating some dudes ass to a pulp?

  Now, that I have the questions there, I should explain a bit to why I&#39;m asking them, right? My friend(16 years old, female), is dating some faggot(age 15, male). She only dates him because he has liked her for several years. She does NOT know that he hangs out with the 4 biggest nerds in the school to talk about Runescape, then go home and go on the Runescape forums and talk more about Runescape, then play Runescape for the rest of the day. Now, he is a football player, he works out during practice(sometimes, I barley see him at practice. The freshmen show up more than he does), he has played one time this entire season, for one play, his jersey is so clean. Well, they&#39;ve been dating for a month or so now, and I&#39;ve known them both for 2-ish years(i know her better though, i don&#39;t like him very much). 
  Well, she has planned to wait till marriage to have sex, and she told him that. He told her the same thing. Ever since then, I have noticed him bringing up that topic a lot, and he tells her that he will marry her one day. A few days later at an assembly, some guy comes in and talks about how Drugs and Alcohol is bad, and tells us Condoms and Preg. Pills don&#39;t work(GG. Tell us something new?). Well, he brings up the topic once again during the assembly, and I was sitting right behind them, so I had a chance to listen. He pushes her and pushes her to have sex with him, right? Then he tells her, even if she got preg. he would support this baby and take care of her(with some kind of freaky look in his eyes). So being a girl in love(or is it love?), she says she wants to have sex with him, but she will wait. This makes him VERY unhappy. Last night she showed up at my front door damn near naked, crying, with bruises on her arms.
  She tells me a story which I shall not repeat, but she was lucky to get away without any harm done. Today at school I planned to crack his skull; Unfortunately, he was not there. Now she is pleading I don&#39;t do anything to him for I will go to prison, which I have no doubt will happen(or at least if he doesn&#39;t hit me back, right?). 

Is it worth it? Destroy him and go to jail for 15-ish years, or don&#39;t do anything and let him do it again? Hes just some desperate nerd wanting to get laid, and when he doesn&#39;t he tries to rape the girl. I&#39;ve told the police, showed the bruises on her arms, but no real-evidence ties him to the assault. So they do nothing.</description>

No, she(after begging her parents) went to his house for the very first time. According to what she told me, his room was not only messy, it smelled horrible(figures, a nerds room smells horrible. Wonder why?). But they spent most of the time outside, from what she was telling me, he wanted to spend time with her outside of school. It was 8-8:30-ish(I would assume, since it would take 2-4 hours to walk to my house, and she ran half of the way), and it was time for her to go. She got her stuff and began to leave, and thats when he tried to make a move on her. Of course, wanting to wait till marriage, she tried to leave. So he grabbed her and began to try and force himself on her. She told me she kneed him in the groin and took off.<br>
But this is what shes telling me what happened during her time there.<br>

</aside>
<p>Sexual assault is any physical contact of a sexual nature without voluntary consent. If he tried to touch… Um… Her, it would be Sexual Assault.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment is harassment or unwelcome attention of a sexual nature. It includes a range of behavior from mild transgressions and annoyances to serious abuses, which can even involve forced sexual activity.</p>
<p>So it’s both.</p>
<p>The judge could also tack on:</p>
<p>Assault<br>

Breaking and Entering (Assuming he broke into her house)</p>

<p>Yes, that’s right, he shouldn’t listen to you. Just because you know someone that didn’t get caught it doesn’t mean that he isn’t going to. That’s like saying “I know someone that robbed a bank and got away with it, if you need money, you should do it too!”.
