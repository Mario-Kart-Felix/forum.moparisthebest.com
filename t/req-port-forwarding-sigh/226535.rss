    <title>[REQ]Port Forwarding... *sigh*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-port-forwarding-sigh/226535</link>
    <description>Well, ive been looking for a few days to port forward on my O2 Wireless Box II tried portforward.com aswell, and it seems its pretty much like taking a long walk off a short pier... well anyways, when i do &quot;Attempt&quot; to forward my port it comes up as.

Protocol: UDP/TCP/ANY (i know this part)
Port Range &quot;43594&quot; to &quot;43592&quot; *im assuming*
Translate to: Now what the hell is this, with my old router ive never had this, and i dont even have a clue what this is tbh.
Trigger Protocol, UDP/TCP/ANY
Trigger port, 43592 im assuming...

Well, i dont know what the translate part is, ive tried putting my port in the translate part aswell asuming that because there is only a 5 char limit in the box.

Then its asking for to assign a game/application to a device, it has a list of the devices that are connected to my router atm, and i know the &quot;home&quot; one is my laptop which im going to be hosting on (is wireless connected, dunno if this relys on anything)
uPnP which i keep enabled i think, well i cant do anything really without it on, i.e; cant connect to other peoples host on xbl etc.

Well im pretty stumped now. I have Windows Firewall turned off and the ports enabled in the exceptions both UDP and TCP.
Any help would be appriciated. Thanks :D</description>
