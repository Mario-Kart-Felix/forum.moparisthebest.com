    <title>ObjectClick (Adding Doors)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/objectclick-adding-doors/366230</link>
    <description>Hey all,
recently i have been planning to create a private server and have bumped into a small problem inside the objectclick.java file, the code below is representing the door into the crafting guild.


case 2647:
if(objectX == 2933 &amp;&amp; objectY == 3289){
client.getActionAssistant().object(1512, objectX, objectY+1, 1, 0);
client.getActionAssistant().object(14000, objectX, objectY, 0, 1);
}


i would love to understand how you operate doors making them open and close, i have tried making the object face different ways but i just dont understand it . i hope you can explain and help me understand what way the doors face and how you make them face that way .

Thanks A LOT,

RuneHel.</description>
