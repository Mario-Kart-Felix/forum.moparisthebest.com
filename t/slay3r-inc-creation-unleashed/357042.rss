    <description>


[/center]Hello, and welcome to the Slay3r Inc. Project thread, here you will find all you need to know about our project goals, progress, and how to get involved. So let&#39;s begin.[left][font=book antiqua][size=2em][u][b]Slay3r Incorporated -[/b][/u][/size][/font][/left]Slay3r Inc is a small business run and maintained by [user]Demetri[/user] and
[user]ẨřЌαdĩαņ[/user], Two very capable and well known programmers for their work
in the fields of Client, and Server development.

Personally, we meet people EVERYDAY who are looking for a server, a good
server to play, not some over-used, badly programmed server, run by 12 year
old, or a straight download and run. People we meet want something new,
something big, something that has a purpose.

I have seen servers out there with, 400 players online, which are run by 
[b]complete[/b] idiots, who abuse members, sell items unfairly and are purely in
the game for profit, with bugged servers, duping strife, and I wonder,
&#39;Why are people putting up with this [b]CRAP[/b]?&#39;, and now I know. 

It is because people do not have a choice, yes it may be shit, but it is the best
shit that is available to these poor people, which is why we bring to you, Slay3r
Inc., [i][u]It&#39;s what we deserve.[/u][/i][right][font=book antiqua][size=2em][u][b]...The Difference...[/b][/u][/size][/font]

&quot;Yeah, yeah, I have heard it all before&quot; - Is this what you are thinking?
You have seen countless project threads, no matter how promising
all saying they are different, exciting, new and will be a change, and 
they all end up failing the same way, so who is to say that this won&#39;t be
the same story as the rest?[INDENT][INDENT][u]
It is simple.[/u][/INDENT][/INDENT][INDENT]
[/right]
[ul][li]We are [b]not[/b] competing for money.[/li]
	[li]We are [b]not[/b] doing this as a &#39;learning&#39; experience.[/li]
	[li]We are [b]not[/b] making a game simply how we want it.[/li]
	[li]We are [b]not[/b] trying to re-create RuneScape.[/li]
	[li]We are [b]not[/b] setting ourselves unreachable goals.[/li][/ul]
[/INDENT]This will be different for the simple fact, 
We are [b]organized[/b], we are [b]prepared[/b],
we are [b]skilled[/b], and we are [b]ready[/b].

You can believe us or not, the result will be the same we [b]WILL[/b]
succeed, we [b]WILL[/b] progress, and we [b]WILL[/b] make it.[left][font=book antiqua][size=2em][u][b]Slay3r Realms[/b][/u][/size][/font][/left]Slay3r Inc. - As a project will be based around a single [i]Game-Platform[/i]
which players will download and play from, the [i]Game-Platform[/i] will be
connected to 5 Different Realms, each one completely seperate from the others
each realm is a different, and unique server, that matches different peoples
needs and likes in a server.

Please note; All Servers will be given names - We just have not officially named
any yet.[left][size=1.45em][b][u]Adventure Server;[/u][/b][/size]

The &#39;Adventure Server&#39; will be based throughout all of the RuneScape world.
This world is designed for players who like a challenge, and the feeling of
accomplishment when they earn levels, and money.

The Economy will be strong, and slow, with every popular mini-game and skill
available. This server will cater for those who want to skill for money, and play
a high quality server, with a greater purpose.
