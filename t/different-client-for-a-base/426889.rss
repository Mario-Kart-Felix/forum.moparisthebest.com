    <title>Different client for a base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/different-client-for-a-base/426889</link>
    <description>Hi I am using 317[PI] base, I have added random stuff on to it, now I hate the client :( it looks old, I would like it to be 614+. The problem is in 317 client [maparea] and [invarea] are located under spirits. In the 614 client(s) that I have downloaded has auto-cache downlader and not the spirit folder. Can anyone gimmick the pictures of it?

Thank in advance.
Shawn


Edit : I have never worked with 508+ server.</description>
