    <description>Hey, I&#39;m making a ::godzone and i need some suggestions on a good place to put it, like a cave or island or unused building... Please put down any suggestions because all I have come up with so far is &quot;2903 , 2903&quot; picked because it has a zamorak alter, but I need a better place, please!!!</description>

<p>I used to have a place but I lost it, it was a big round cave and it was dark…lol, does anyone know where that is, it was there when I got my Delta 317 server and it was called ::staffzone .</p>
