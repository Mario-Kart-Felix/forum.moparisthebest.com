    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/exchaning-pk-points-for-items/337475</link>
    <description>Ok i have no idea how to set this up so i thought i could make it, so you exchange the points for an item personally not through a shop basically what i mean

talk to santa he says &quot;would you like to trade 500 pk points for a AGS?&quot;

how would the code for that work? something like this?
[code]			case 127:
				talk(&quot;would you like to trade 500 pk points for a AGS?&quot;, 1552);
                                                                break;
			case 128:
				choice(&quot;Yes.&quot;, &quot;No.&quot;);
				break;
			case 129:
				talk(&quot;Ok Enjoy Your Item&quot;, 1552);
                                                   deleteItem(???, 1);
                                                   addItem(35, 1);
                                                                break;[code]
