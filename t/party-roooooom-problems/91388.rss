    <title>Party Roooooom! - Problems =/</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/party-roooooom-problems/91388</link>
    <description>1. I know it will probably take a LOOT of coding but could anyone get the chest/lever thing to work where you put items in, pay the cash and pull the lever for the balloons to come down and stuff? If you could do that it would be excellenté!

2. On a lesser note, I also still need the code to raise levels.

Thx if anyone could help with any party room stuff (Apart from the knights as they&#39;re already working) I would be VERRRY grateful kthxbai lol =3
