    <title>[PI] Bows + Arrows</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-bows-arrows/399298</link>
    <description>Sup guys, i&#39;ve just began learning java and how it works, 
and what i would like to know is how to fix bows/arrows.

First off the arrows i want in my server do not stack, they just have say 28 arrows taking up my whole inventory except just 1 slot that holds an amount of arrows. How do i fix?

My second problem is that i am trying to make my sagatarian longbow work properly, problem is the above problem with the sagatarian arrows, and even if still only 1 sagatarian arrow is equipped it still says the bow can only fire sagatarian arrows.
