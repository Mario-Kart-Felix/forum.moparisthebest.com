    <title>What the fuck?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-the-fuck/373904</link>
    <description>Anyways, I just bought two samsung 20 inch led monitors to replace my current 1 21.5 inch lcd monitor. I assumed that I could only hook up two cards to my ATI Radeon 5850 so I only bought two. Now it comes to my attention that I can hook up 3 fucking monitors to one card, this is crazy. So bottom line. Is it worth getting another 20 inch samsung monitor for gaming? Currently I can Crysis on two at 3200x900 using eyeinfinity on ultra high settings and it runs smooth, but the cross hair is cut between the two screens making it impossible to play. Should I get another monitor and hook it up to play on three screens or do you think this will finally be the last straw for playing games at high framerates. The new resolution would be 4800x900 would that finally do me in for low performance. In perspective I used to play crysis on full hd screen 1080p so that would be 1920x1080 = 2073600pixels, my current setup is 3200x900 = 2880000 pixels, then another screen would be 4800x900 pixels so that would be 4320000. 

tl;tr: should I buy a third monitor to play games on an ati radeon 5850.

Oh and to put my currenty setup in prespective:

<p>What happened to the “21.5 inch lcd monitor” you bought those two to replace?  Why not put that one in the middle? (or on either side, guess there wouldn’t be much of a difference)  That would at least let you see how you like it and your computer handles it before shelling out the extra money.</p>

<p>Your right I was considering that, but I had put it in the box it came with and was going to give it to my dad for christmas, I was also afraid it wouldnt give me an accurate represnetation seeing that the resoultion is 1920x1080 which is alot more than 1600x900, but I will probably try it tomorrow, I have to buy another hdmi cable.</p>

<p>What, currently? or with 3 monitors my views good now I am usually working on programs and shit while watching a show on the other monitor. If am watching a full screen movie or show I downloaded I usually spread it across both monitors and sit on the couch behind me becuase I cant hook up my tv on the wall anymore since I moved my computer away from the hdmi outlet.</p>
