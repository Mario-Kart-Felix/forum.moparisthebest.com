    <title>What The Fuck?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-the-fuck/125685</link>
    <description>I swear I am cursed. I cannot stay healthy for more than 4 weeks. Yes, I did quit football, but, I decided to finish the season off. So today being game day, Saturday, we were playing. If anyone knows me pretty well they will know that I am an extremely fierce competitor. I always give my 110% in everything, in football, I put my body on the line, in Motocross, I put my life on the line.

Anyway, it was getting close to the end, and I was still trying my heart out, regardless of how stuffed I was. And I was head highed, very, very, very, badly. I slammed my head into the ground and blacked out for about 2 seconds. I woke up and played the ball, then layed down, acting very strangely. I do not remember any of it, apart from what I have been told. I wasn&#39;t knocked out though which is the strange part.

I somehow finished the game, regardless of how swollen my knee was, how much I was dizzy, how bloody my mouth was and last but not least, not knowing what the hell I was doing. So anywho, I had to walk home as we walked to the game because the field was just down the road. On the way home, I threw up.

Sorry if it seems I make so many posts like this, but it&#39;s the only thing I have to talk about. All you people can talk about making a game in Java and stuff.</description>
