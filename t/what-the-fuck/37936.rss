</aside>
<p>Well, not really pathetic. The Chinese work on 12+ accounts at the same time in modified yew chopping clients, in small gold farming complexes where they live and sleep. They make very little money, most of the profit goes to the person running the farm. The dude probably worked himself to death to feed his family (or buy meth). Not pathetic, awesome!</p>
<p>Go capitalism!</p>
<p>Go socialism!</p>
<p>Socialism uses “Slave Labor”…</p>
<p>It’s super effective!</p>

<p>Actually the game he played was Lineage, which is the most popular game in South Korea (or maybe there was a World of Warcrack death too, I don’t know).</p>
