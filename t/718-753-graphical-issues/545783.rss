    <title>[718/753] Graphical Issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-753-graphical-issues/545783</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just recently downloaded the 718/753 client and server and have been playing around with it for a little now.  There are a few things that I noticed and I&#39;m unsure how to fix them or if they can be fixed.

1. On Tutorial Island there is a house that is missing an entire wall.  How can I add the wall back?  If there is something out there already that explains this please just point me in that direction.

&lt;&lt;See Screenshot Below&gt;&gt;

2. Giant Rats become distorted when they are attacked?  They path around just fine but while being attacked they distort.  Is this a rendering issue or just updating their attack emote?

&lt;&lt;See Screenshot Below&gt;&gt;

Not sure if this is a cache issue with the server I downloaded or if this is something that can be corrected manually.   I&#39;ve done a fair amount of searching and haven&#39;t found anything on these issues.

Thanks for any help or nudges in the right direction.
Cheers!</description>
