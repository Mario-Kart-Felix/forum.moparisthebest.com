    <title>♠♥♣Itzscape Rewrite♠♥♣</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/itzscape-rewrite/146002</link>
    <description>I Am the creator of Itzscape as known on there as &quot;Kyle&quot; and on Moparscape.org/smf as &quot;Itzkyle&quot;
Anyways I have recently shut down the server Itzscape with over 70k Charactor files in the first 4 weeks. 

Why did i do this?
So that the Itzscape team could have more help in codeing the server since we are rewriting it.

Ok well.. I have decided to start a Community/Development team of a server. Called Itzscape V3 Rewrite. ]
I currently have four people working on this project with me so I said what the heck why not let the good people at Mopar Help me.  

Ok well heres what will happen. Currently I do have a source and unless someone announces a better one we will be using the one I have chosen (Pimpscape Beta)

Please notice all of the people who apply for JOBS WILL get Super Admin in game HOWEVER! They will NOT be aloud on there Super Admin accounts unless they are testing. Super Admins cannot make trades drop items or KILL ANYONE! THE SERVER WILL not let you. Super Admin accounts are souly  for testing ONLY!

All thoese who are accepted will recieve a regular Admin account for in game purposes. Will Have lots of commands but wont be able to trade or drop items.
