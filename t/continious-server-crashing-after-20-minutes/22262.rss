    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/continious-server-crashing-after-20-minutes/22262</link>
    <description>ok i have my server set up and running i have had 25+ people in the server at times and everything has been running fine, but usually after 20 minutes my server crashes for some reason could it be a virus or infection on my computer causing this?   

when i start my server my CPU is 20 30 % any normal computer speed, then after 20 minutes or so it jumps to 100% and my computer lags at everything, and the server crashes. (only hits 100% when im running the server for 20 minutes) 

please answer my problem as it is proving to be a popular server but it wont it it keeps crashing</description>
