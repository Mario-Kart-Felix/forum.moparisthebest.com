    <description>I am trying to make a quest tab teleport to a member area that only members can use but it lets anyone through. I&#39;ve tried many different combinations of the code below but they still let everyone who clicks on it through.

[code]        public void q11help() {
		if (member = true) {
			toX = 2741;
			toY = 3574;
			heightLevel = 0;
			sM(&quot;Welcome to the Member Hangout place.&quot;);
		} else if (member != true) { I&#39;ve also tried member == false and none work.!!!
			sM(&quot;You&#39;re not a member! Sign up at [MyWebsite].&quot;);
		}
		}[/code]
Ive also tried member = false and nothing i tried worked. It still let everyone through. help!</description>

<p>this is the exact same as your big mac burger sized code, yet it will do the same thing. If not, try this one:</p>
<p><code>
public void q11help() {
        if (member = true)) {
                triggerTele(2741, 3574, 0);
                sM("Welcome to the Member Hangout place.");
        } else {
        sM("You're not a member! Sign up at [MyWebsite]");              
        }
}</code></p>
