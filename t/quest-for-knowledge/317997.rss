    <description>Hello all, I was wondering if there were any people out there who would be so kind as to explain to me how some things work.

In the past I have &quot;coded&quot; (&lt; a very loose term of the word) and hosted a private server here and so I know the basics of how everything is setup and laid out. One thing that I never understood was the Client and exactly how it works. Surely if I were to download a decompiled client I should find 3d models of all of the charactors, maps and scenery etc but that isnt the case - I guess im just asking how the client works and whether or not my understanding of &quot;Client = Items/Objects/Models and Server = Placing/Positioning/Coding&quot; was accurate or not. 

It&#39;s a bit of a noob question, I know so thanks in advance and sorry for the slightly unrelated topic.</description>
