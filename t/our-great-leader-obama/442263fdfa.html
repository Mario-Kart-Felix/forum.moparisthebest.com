Calm down my friend, being disrespectful about others lack of respect isn’t wrong. If you think he is gay, post a nice picture of yourself to charm him (Shirtless), that could silence him if you are so certain in your belief.</p>

<p>well, I don’t recall ever calling you disrespectful, I do recall calling you an ignorant bigoted homophobic poor excuse for a human being, and as far as I’m concerned every one of those names is an adequate label</p>
<p>and no, I’m sorry, it isn’t just “your beliefs”, just like most other ignorant bigoted homophobes you act on those beliefs and prevent people from receiving equal rights and take action to keep “your beliefs” part of the law of your state and country, it it because of your actions that I’m calling you an ignorant bigoted homophobe for a human being</p>

<p>No, your the piece of shit. You act all high and mighty being an ex staff, ohhh you get to say whatever you want.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not calling you an ignorant homophobic bigot because I damn well feel like it, I call you that because it describes your character based on the argument you make and the beliefs you seem to hold</p>
<p>ig·no·rant/ˈignərənt/<br>
Adjective:	Lacking knowledge or awareness in general; uneducated or unsophisticated.</p>
<p>in one post you posted the argument that a child is best being raised by the childs natural birth parent with heavy implications on a “no exceptions” part, when I asked you that if this meant that if a child was being abused by their birth parents that this is best for them you neglected to reply to clarify your position on that</p>
<p>in the same argument you stated that adopted, fostered children, children of single parents have difficulties when being raised, this claim does not take into account things like single parent rates being higher in lower class areas where children have difficulties being raised, I pointed this very situation out, correlation does not equal causation and all that and by claiming this to be true shows ignorance</p>
<p>another argument that shows ignorant is the claim you made that there is no genetic link to being gay, whether or not there is a genetic link this is STILL a logical fallacy called argument from ignorance</p>
<p>Argument from ignorance, also known as argumentum ad ignorantiam or “appeal to ignorance” (where “ignorance” stands for: “lack of evidence to the contrary”), is a fallacy in informal logic. It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false, it is “generally accepted” (or vice versa). This represents a type of false dichotomy in that it excludes a third option, which is that there is insufficient investigation and therefore insufficient information to prove the proposition satisfactorily to be either true or false.</p>
<p>I could stop here but I won’t, whether or not there exists such a thing as a gay gene is irrelevant, in the same argument you also claimed that “gay behaviour” can be changed, I consider this a strawman argument, yes, “gay behaviour” can be changed in the sense that you can make a gay person BEHAVE the same as a straight person, they don’t stop being gay and it’s likely that they don’t stop being attracted to the same sex, scientists can’t verify that gay people can change who they are attracted to but we do know that people who undergo gay behaviour therapy do say that it didn’t change who they are attracted to, and basic logic dictates that if your claim is unnecessary complicated and goes against evidence then it is extremely unlikely to be true</p>
<p>I said earlier that whether or not a gay gene exists is irrelevant, I said this because gay people are born gay, it is not a learned behaviour and they do not choose who they are attracted to, and if you want to get really technical then you should consider other situations such as transgendered people, where their “gender identity” (which is a stupid term) does not match their biological identity, there’s also situations where a female can be born 100% biologically female but have a penis, and while you aren’t saying this personally so don’t take this as a straman, many people who are against gay rights are against transgendered peoples rights as well, which is a bigoted opinion and I’m sure you hold it too, am I wrong? prove me wrong, please, for the good of all society</p>
<p>Bigotry is the state of mind of a “bigot”, a person obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices, especially one who exhibits intolerance or animosity toward members of a group.[1] Bigotry may be based on real or perceived characteristics, including sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, nationality, region, language, religious or spiritual belief, personal habits, political alignment, age, economic status or disability.</p>
<p>another example showing your bigotry is that you claim a marriage is between a man and a woman for the sole purpose of recreation (which is also ignorant, that is not and has never been a valid definition of marriage), when I demonstrated that people who cannot reproduce would have an invalid marriage I also asked you if you thought their marriage was invalid, you failed to reply, but given the context it is clear the only marriage you are against is anything but man and a woman, showing clear bigotry against same sex couples</p>
<p>and finally another example of your bigotry is that, even if two people who identify as straight enter a same sex marriage for whatever reason, that is a right they should have and by denying them that right you are denying it because you claim it is against your belief, showing bigotry against same-sex marriages</p>
<p>one example of ignorance for a change is you posted an argument along the lines that gay marriage is not a civil right such as interracial marriages, this is ignorant of what civil rights are and I demonstrated it in my previous post, but I’ll give you a hint right here, marriage is a civil right, by denying same sex couples that right you are denying them civil rights</p>
<p>and finally I don’t think I need to spell it out as to why, but many of your arguments were very homophobic</p>
<p>so, mr lostmyphat, while you may not personally be ignorant, bigoted and homophobic, the arguments YOU POST and the beliefs you seem to hold are very much ignorant, bigoted and homophobic, and I say it isn’t much of a stretch to claim that you are ignorant, homophobic and bigoted based on your behaviour towards me</p>
<p>bonus content: you are also a hypocrite, you (wrongly I might add) criticise me for calling you names for no reason, but you do not apply the same standard towards yourself -</p>

<p>Bigotry is the state of mind of a “bigot”, a person obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices, especially one who exhibits intolerance or animosity toward members of a group.[1] Bigotry may be based on real or perceived characteristics, including sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, nationality, region, language, religious or spiritual belief, personal habits, political alignment, age, economic status or disability.</p>
<p>another example showing your bigotry is that you claim a marriage is between a man and a woman for the sole purpose of recreation (which is also ignorant, that is not and has never been a valid definition of marriage), when I demonstrated that people who cannot reproduce would have an invalid marriage I also asked you if you thought their marriage was invalid, you failed to reply, but given the context it is clear the only marriage you are against is anything but man and a woman, showing clear bigotry against same sex couples</p>
<p>and finally another example of your bigotry is that, even if two people who identify as straight enter a same sex marriage for whatever reason, that is a right they should have and by denying them that right you are denying it because you claim it is against your belief, showing bigotry against same-sex marriages</p>
<p>one example of ignorance for a change is you posted an argument along the lines that gay marriage is not a civil right such as interracial marriages, this is ignorant of what civil rights are and I demonstrated it in my previous post, but I’ll give you a hint right here, marriage is a civil right, by denying same sex couples that right you are denying them civil rights</p>
<p>and finally I don’t think I need to spell it out as to why, but many of your arguments were very homophobic</p>
<p>so, mr lostmyphat, while you may not personally be ignorant, bigoted and homophobic, the arguments YOU POST and the beliefs you seem to hold are very much ignorant, bigoted and homophobic, and I say it isn’t much of a stretch to claim that you are ignorant, homophobic and bigoted based on your behaviour towards me</p>
<p>bonus content: you are also a hypocrite, you (wrongly I might add) criticise me for calling you names for no reason, but you do not apply the same standard towards yourself -</p>

<p>I’m not calling you an ignorant homophobic bigot because I damn well feel like it, I call you that because it describes your character based on the argument you make and the beliefs you seem to hold</p>
<p>ig·no·rant/ˈignərənt/<br>
Adjective:	Lacking knowledge or awareness in general; uneducated or unsophisticated.</p>
<p>in one post you posted the argument that a child is best being raised by the childs natural birth parent with heavy implications on a “no exceptions” part, when I asked you that if this meant that if a child was being abused by their birth parents that this is best for them you neglected to reply to clarify your position on that</p>
<p>in the same argument you stated that adopted, fostered children, children of single parents have difficulties when being raised, this claim does not take into account things like single parent rates being higher in lower class areas where children have difficulties being raised, I pointed this very situation out, correlation does not equal causation and all that and by claiming this to be true shows ignorance</p>
<p>another argument that shows ignorant is the claim you made that there is no genetic link to being gay, whether or not there is a genetic link this is STILL a logical fallacy called argument from ignorance</p>
<p>Argument from ignorance, also known as argumentum ad ignorantiam or “appeal to ignorance” (where “ignorance” stands for: “lack of evidence to the contrary”), is a fallacy in informal logic. It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false, it is “generally accepted” (or vice versa). This represents a type of false dichotomy in that it excludes a third option, which is that there is insufficient investigation and therefore insufficient information to prove the proposition satisfactorily to be either true or false.</p>

<p>Bigotry is the state of mind of a “bigot”, a person obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices, especially one who exhibits intolerance or animosity toward members of a group.[1] Bigotry may be based on real or perceived characteristics, including sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, nationality, region, language, religious or spiritual belief, personal habits, political alignment, age, economic status or disability.</p>
<p>another example showing your bigotry is that you claim a marriage is between a man and a woman for the sole purpose of recreation (which is also ignorant, that is not and has never been a valid definition of marriage), when I demonstrated that people who cannot reproduce would have an invalid marriage I also asked you if you thought their marriage was invalid, you failed to reply, but given the context it is clear the only marriage you are against is anything but man and a woman, showing clear bigotry against same sex couples</p>
<p>and finally another example of your bigotry is that, even if two people who identify as straight enter a same sex marriage for whatever reason, that is a right they should have and by denying them that right you are denying it because you claim it is against your belief, showing bigotry against same-sex marriages</p>
<p>one example of ignorance for a change is you posted an argument along the lines that gay marriage is not a civil right such as interracial marriages, this is ignorant of what civil rights are and I demonstrated it in my previous post, but I’ll give you a hint right here, marriage is a civil right, by denying same sex couples that right you are denying them civil rights</p>
<p>and finally I don’t think I need to spell it out as to why, but many of your arguments were very homophobic</p>
<p>so, mr lostmyphat, while you may not personally be ignorant, bigoted and homophobic, the arguments YOU POST and the beliefs you seem to hold are very much ignorant, bigoted and homophobic, and I say it isn’t much of a stretch to claim that you are ignorant, homophobic and bigoted based on your behaviour towards me</p>
<p>bonus content: you are also a hypocrite, you (wrongly I might add) criticise me for calling you names for no reason, but you do not apply the same standard towards yourself -</p>
