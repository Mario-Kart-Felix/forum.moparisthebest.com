<p>Watch those. There is a double standard on these forums. I want you all to see that.[/quote]</p>
<p>The problem with words like nigger and faggot is some organisations would like people to stop using the word because the words are <span class="bbcode-b">offensive</span>, and while the matter of if offensive words should be used is another issue, the issue here is that these organisations go about their goals by claiming that using the word nigger automatically makes you a racist, or that by using the word faggot automatically makes you a homophobe, and while racist assholes and homophobic bigots may use those words, just using those words does not make you racist or a homophobe and by claiming that it does you are devaluing what being a racist or a homophobe is.</p>
<p>You want to call me a racist for using the word nigger? That’s fine, I however consider a racist a person that wants to remove civil and human rights from a group of people because of an undefinable term, race, and I find the act of denying any group of people civil or human rights absolutely disgusting. So you tell me, is it a double standard for me to call you a faggot, and you to hold the opinion that same sex couples shouldn’t receive equal civil rights? Because I think one of those opinions is actually derogatory to a minority in society and to society as a whole while the other is merely a matter of offensive speech.</p>

<p>If you guys can’t stay mature in this discussion, this topic will be closed. Please act like adults and be reasonable.</p>

</aside>
<p>May I chip in? I’ve noticed this a lot recently, people on the forum start a discussion and one side starts losing, so instead of doing the adult or mature thing and withdrawing from the discussion said side resorts to tactics like what m1lkman is doing now and try to get the thread locked. If you want a mature or adult discussion then for the love of all that is unholy give warnings to people who step out of line and DO NOT lock the thread, by locking the thread you are satisfying the goals of people who want the thread locked because they are losing and you are censoring the people who actually care about things like, in this case, civil rights for same sex couples.</p>

<p>Just because it’s said in a jest does not mean it isn’t hurtful or bigoted.[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh so you’re complaining that people are bullying you unfairly because of you said something that should have been taken in jest? Well what if I told you that delivery of a line counts(shocking I know), when you say that you “hate gay people” and that “They [gay people] are all fucking cunts” and give no context, people are going to and will assume you are a homophobic bigoted asshole and you will forever be known as a homophobic bigoted asshole, and welcome to the real life kid because this is an important life lesson you shouldn’t forget. You want to mend the situation here? Then apologise and state that you did not mean for your words to come off as homophobic and bigoted and stop trying to sidestep the issue like a self-righteous cunt which is what you are doing right now.</p>

“I hate the action of being American, but I don’t hate Americans.”<br>
How am I not hating Americans with that statement? It is no different from your bigoted remark about you not tolerating someone who step outside what you consider as normal.</p>
<p>Hating the natural lifestyle of someone is just as you hate them.</p>
<p>I have heard two kind of groups who dislikes homosexuality. Stalinist and Religious people, why should listen to nutty people like you? And when are you going to persecute people for breaking the rest of the biblical laws?</p>

<p>I honestly couldn’t care less if you hate the act and not the individual, because when you are against same-sex marriage etc (and to my knowledge you still are) you are denying <span class="bbcode-b">the individual equal civil rights</span>. I’m all for the right for groups like the KKK to exist, what I am not for is groups like the KKK to remove equal civil and human rights from other groups. I don’t care if you spout bigoted homophobic opinions, what I care about is that you don’t deny lgbt people <span class="bbcode-b">equal civil rights</span>.</p>
<p>Another thing is that even if you don’t hate the individual, that doesn’t change the fact that you are a bigot or a homophobe, go look up the dictionary and common usage definition of those words if you can’t figure out why. (Hint: being homophobic/bigoted applies to the group just as much as the individual)</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t care if, according to the dictionary, I’m a homophobe or a bigot. I had 2 gay kids in my math class last year and I didn’t treat them any more differently than I would anyone else. I hate homosexuality. I hate that men like other men and women like other women. I think it is disgusting. But, just as a gay person is entitled to like other gay people, I am entitled to think it is disgusting.</p>
<p>I was flamed for saying, “homosexuality is disgusting, IMO” on MITB. I see those who flamed me as hypocritical. They think other people are allowed to hold their own opinion but I’m not allowed to hold my own.</p>

<p>That’s why I included a “common usage” definition. If you don’t care about the dictionary definition but DO care when people call you those words then well I have no idea what to suggest other than changing your attitude. You can’t have your cake and eat it too.</p>

<p>Comparing apples to oranges aren’t we? The right to love is arguably a human right and the right to an opinion about it is a matter of free speech. Of course I’m not saying free speech is any less value but honestly.</p>
<p>Oh and you should take pride in the fact no one anywhere(yet at least heheheh) can take away your own private thinking space, what you do up there is your own business until it comes out as an opinion or actions, then it’s no longer your business as you are involving other people.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m sure some people think you shouldn’t have an opinion, I can say right now I am not one of those people and I doubt t4 and bowser among others are those people either. You can have your opinion and we can tell you how stupid/wrong/morally corrupt it is, that’s how free speech works. You can’t have free speech unless you allow the people who say free speech is wrong and shouldn’t be a right. It doesn’t mean they’re valid but they should have the right to protest free speech.</p>
<p>Of course I don’t necessarily care what you say about homosexual people but as I’ve stated I will care when peoples civil and human rights are being infringed, if you take away someone’s rights or actively seek to prevent people from receiving equal rights it’s no longer an issue of opinion or free speech.</p>

<p>The difference between calling someone a nigger and being racist is that calling someone a nigger doesn’t automatically mean they’re a racist, holding the opinion that (black) people from africa are an inferior species of human is however racist, just like calling someone a fag doesn’t make them a homophobe, holding the opinion that same sex couples are inferior and do not deserve to get married does make you a homophobe.</p>

<p>Watch those. There is a double standard on these forums. I want you all to see that.</p>

</aside>
<p>The problem with words like nigger and faggot is some organisations would like people to stop using the word because the words are <span class="bbcode-b">offensive</span>, and while the matter of if offensive words should be used is another issue, the issue here is that these organisations go about their goals by claiming that using the word nigger automatically makes you a racist, or that by using the word faggot automatically makes you a homophobe, and while racist assholes and homophobic bigots may use those words, just using those words does not make you racist or a homophobe and by claiming that it does you are devaluing what being a racist or a homophobe is.</p>
<p>You want to call me a racist for using the word nigger? That’s fine, I however consider a racist a person that wants to remove civil and human rights from a group of people because of an undefinable term, race, and I find the act of denying any group of people civil or human rights absolutely disgusting. So you tell me, is it a double standard for me to call you a faggot, and you to hold the opinion that same sex couples shouldn’t receive equal civil rights? Because I think one of those opinions is actually derogatory to a minority in society and to society as a whole while the other is merely a matter of offensive speech.</p>

<p>If you guys can’t stay mature in this discussion, this topic will be closed. Please act like adults and be reasonable.</p>

</aside>
<p>May I chip in? I’ve noticed this a lot recently, people on the forum start a discussion and one side starts losing, so instead of doing the adult or mature thing and withdrawing from the discussion said side resorts to tactics like what m1lkman is doing now and try to get the thread locked. If you want a mature or adult discussion then for the love of all that is unholy give warnings to people who step out of line and DO NOT lock the thread, by locking the thread you are satisfying the goals of people who want the thread locked because they are losing and you are censoring the people who actually care about things like, in this case, civil rights for same sex couples.</p>

</aside>
<p>Oh so you’re complaining that people are bullying you unfairly because of you said something that should have been taken in jest? Well what if I told you that delivery of a line counts(shocking I know), when you say that you “hate gay people” and that “They [gay people] are all fucking cunts” and give no context, people are going to and will assume you are a homophobic bigoted asshole and you will forever be known as a homophobic bigoted asshole, and welcome to the real life kid because this is an important life lesson you shouldn’t forget. You want to mend the situation here? Then apologise and state that you did not mean for your words to come off as homophobic and bigoted and stop trying to sidestep the issue like a self-righteous cunt which is what you are doing right now.[/quote]<br>
What your saying is 100% true, however I’d probably say that people know that the word ‘nigger’ etc is offensive and so forth and still choose to use it.</p>
