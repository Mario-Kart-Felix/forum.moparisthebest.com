PkOwnage is a Server that has recently returned again from the old one that was running around 10 Months ago, We shut down for a while whilst keeping the forums and site running and now we&#39;re back with the release of a new OSRS Based server! You could almost say this is PkOwnage v5 or something haha, since I also ran a server named PkOwnage back in 2008 which never even achieved a VPS but still managed 15+ Online not bad for a Project Czar eh! Well, I&#39;m certainly still around and you can join me on the new PkOwnage Adventure!

PkOwnage is based around PKing but we also have a fairly strong economy; meaning that when you do PK you generally will achieve some wealth if you were to Smite someone and they had some sort of risk! We may have a fairly strong economy meaning you will need to work your way up from the bottom when you begin but we also do offer quick spawning sets so you would be able to gear up quicker for quicker combat with friends and foes! See more of this in the media

Enough about PKing, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all well aware of how to! PkOwnage not only offers PKing but also a variety of Minigames, Bosses and challenges along the way! We&#39;re always looking for new additions to the server so that everyone has a great time when playing. A recent addition to the server was Revenants and we saw a huge increase of PK activity deeper in the wilderness; Which you&#39;re unable to teleport in unless you&#39;re in 20 or under wilderness! 

We have so much more to add to the server still and it&#39;d be great to hear your suggestions as to what you like and dislike; feedback is always welcome on our current forums! We do hope to move to a full professional website with web-host soon!
