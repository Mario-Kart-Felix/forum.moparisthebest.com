    <title>[PI] [525] No Response From Server, NEED HELP PLEASE!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-525-no-response-from-server-need-help-please/428807</link>
    <description>I am using Hybrid Pvp v3 Sourve, When i try to log onto my server it says &quot;No response from server, Please try a different world&quot;, i have checked many threads but cannot fix, i sent my source and client to a friend and told him how to set up and it worked for him and he was able to portforward host it and i could connect to his server but when i try to host it and login he cannot saying the error message, Ive portforwarded correctly and it says the port is open, i have checked all the banned ips and users and files and theyre all empty.
I don&#39;t see why its doing it as ive set it up and he did everything i did but it doesnt work for me.

Any suggestions ?
Thanks</description>
