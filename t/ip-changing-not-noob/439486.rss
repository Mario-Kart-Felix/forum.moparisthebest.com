    <title>Ip changing (not noob)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ip-changing-not-noob/439486</link>
    <description>Basically, what I&#39;m trying to do is make the client load the ip from a txt file.  This is for an actually old client (MTP V2) and is only needed so I can connect to other servers without having to download the same client over and over.

Where it says server ip, I&#39;m guessing I would put the directory to the text file?</description>
