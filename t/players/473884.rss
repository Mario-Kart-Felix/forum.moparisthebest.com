    <description>Whenever two players are in the same region, both players get logged out and this is printed in the client console:

[code]RS2 user client - release #317
Error: Error packet size mismatch in getplayer pos
Error: T2 - 81,65,81 - 4,3211,3421 - 0,0,28,127,[/code]

any idea on how to fix?

Note: Two players can be logged in at the same time, but as soon as they can see each other they log out and it prints that.</description>
