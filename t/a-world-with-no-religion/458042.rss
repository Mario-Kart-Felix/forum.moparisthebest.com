    <description>What do you think the world will be like? Maybe people will stop relying on god as an answer and maybe have a more advancement in science like more people would start being scientists then saying god did everything. What do you think the world will be like?
There would be less discrimination and stuff against Jews and other religions. And world war II would have never happened. What do you think?</description>

              <p>It would be much worse then it is now; the notion of religion has for centuries put people in their place, you don’t defy God and pursue your own agenda for if you do you spend eternity in hell (if you follow Christian doctrines). Now if you pursue your own agenda (say you kill someone) you get put in jail for 25 years (but you get let out sooner most of the time) and get to live your life paid at the expense of the tax payer without worry of work, crime is much worse today because most people don’t believe in the concept of a God and thus think they can get away with anything they want. Now I understand religion has caused many wars (the crusades, the conflict in Palestine) but it’s human nature; if it wasn’t religion it would be some other excuse to go to war.</p>

<p>since you have failed to explain your argument I will assume you take issue with the fact that wodskill4eva claims people were executed by the churches, in which case, he is correct, people WERE executed by christian (more specifically, catholic) churches, have you ever heard of the spanish inquisition? you know, where churches executed and tortured people for heresy?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>My first issue with his post was that it was barely readable. I assumed since this was intellectual discussion and debates, posts were held to a higher standard. I guess they aren’t.[/quote]</p>
<p>wodskill4eva may have made a silly post but this is the debates board, if someone makes a post that you disagree with then you are quite welcome to offer a rebuttal to an argument, if you want to hold people to a higher standard you must hold yourself to the same standard, you made a borderline troll post and were called out on it, now you’re trying to shift the blame to wodskill4eva?</p>

<p>[quote]people were executed by churches because they said world is round, we circle around the sun, not the otherway around n shit,</p>

</aside>
<p>The Catholic Church did not argue that the world was flat. In fact, from what I have read about the subject, many Christian scholars supported the notion that the world was round. These Christian scholars range from Saint Augustine (354–430) to Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), an Italian Dominican priest, and an immensely influential philosopher and theologian.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Thomas Aquinas:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>“The physicist proves the earth to be round by one means, the astronomer by another: for the latter proves this by means of mathematics, e.g. by the shapes of eclipses, or something of the sort; while the former proves it by means of physics, e.g. by the movement of heavy bodies towards the center, and so forth.”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In 1492, when Columbus sailed the ocean blue, they found “practical proofs” that the Earth was round.[/quote]</p>
<p>while the catholic church may or may not have argued that the earth was flat, the catholic church argued that the earth was the centre of the universe, and this is well documented most famously by the condemnation of galileo in 1633, I quote the roman catholic church in 1633: </p><blockquote>“The doctrine that the earth is neither the center of the universe nor immovable, but moves even with a daily rotation, is absurd, and both psychologically and theologically false, and at the least an error of faith.”</blockquote>
<p>as to the roundness of the earth, well yeah, you’re generally right, christian scholars generally held the idea that the earth was round to be correct, as did all worthy scholars, the idea of a round earth has been traced back as far as 6th century bc, and the greeks estimated the earths circumference in 240 bc (which depending on the length of the measurement they used, exact length is unknown, the estimate in 240 bc was between 2% and 20% accurate of the actual circumference of the earth)</p>
<p>sailors especially have always known that the earth is round, if the earth was flat then you would be able to see all the ships on the ocean as long as your eyes could resolve them, I believe the original idea that sparked the idea of a round earth was that when sailing, the masts of ships would appear before the bottom of the ship</p>
<p>but, why you ask am I talking about heliocentrism and not a round earth? because wodskill4eva mentioned that people were executed by the churches for holding both ideas, while not strictly true (at least from 1000-1700 for round earth), the churches did execute people for holding the idea of heliocentrisim as it was heresy and in contradiction of the churches scripture, the whole point of wodskill4eva’s post was that the churches executed people who held different ideas, even if those ideas were discussed in a scientific context, simply because it was considered heresy, and while good on you m1lkman (that is not intended to sound sarcastic) for correcting him for stating people were executed for saying the earth was round, I feel you missed the point of the post</p>

<p>and this really is why I replied, without sounding mean you are a complete hypocrite for stating that, your defence of flaming someone for a post is that you yourself would be flamed for making the same post? you could have replied to wodskill4eva without the snarky bullshit but you chose not to, at least, until being called out on it, and this really goes back to my first sentence in this post, if you’re going to hold people to a high standard then you have to hold yourself to the same standard if you want any credibility</p>

<p>since you have failed to explain your argument I will assume you take issue with the fact that wodskill4eva claims people were executed by the churches, in which case, he is correct, people WERE executed by christian (more specifically, catholic) churches, have you ever heard of the spanish inquisition? you know, where churches executed and tortured people for heresy?[/quote]</p>
<p>My first issue with his post was that it was barely readable. I assumed since this was intellectual discussion and debates, posts were held to a higher standard. I guess they aren’t.</p>

<blockquote>people were executed by churches because they said world is round, we circle around the sun, not the otherway around n shit,</blockquote>
<p>The Catholic Church did not argue that the world was flat. In fact, from what I have read about the subject, many Christian scholars supported the notion that the world was round. These Christian scholars range from Saint Augustine (354–430) to Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), an Italian Dominican priest, and an immensely influential philosopher and theologian.</p>
<blockquote>"The physicist proves the earth to be round by one means, the astronomer by another: for the latter proves this by means of mathematics, e.g. by the shapes of eclipses, or something of the sort; while the former proves it by means of physics, e.g. by the movement of heavy bodies towards the center, and so forth."</blockquote>
<p>In 1492, when Columbus sailed the ocean blue, they found “practical proofs” that the Earth was round.</p>
<p>The Jesuits actually taught that the Earth was round in 17th Century China:</p>
<blockquote>In the 17th century, the idea of a spherical Earth spread in China due to the influence of the Jesuits, who held high positions as astronomers at the imperial court. The Ge Chi Cao treatise of Xiong Ming-yu (1648) showed a printed picture of the Earth as a spherical globe, with the text stating that "the round earth certainly has no square corners".[122] The text also pointed out that sailing ships could return to their port of origin after circumnavigating the waters of the Earth.[122]</blockquote>

<p>I’m sure I would be flamed if I posted a barely legible reply that made me seem like a snarky idiot who didn’t know what the hell I was talking about. But hey, that’s moparscape for you!</p>
