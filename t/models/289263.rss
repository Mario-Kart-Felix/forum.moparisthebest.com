    <description>Well, I&#39;ve come across this problem. I&#39;m trying to mess with the landscape in/around lumbridge and varrock via some cache editing. Editing the floor and stuff....Blah....Not all that hard. Now...I want to know how to like, possibly delete all of the walls and objects placed in lumbridge and varrock and possible place my own through cache editing. Don&#39;t really know where I would go to do this, though. Any help?

-Thanks,
