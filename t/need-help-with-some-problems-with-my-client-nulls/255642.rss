    <description>Well, I&#39;ve got a good amount of nulls on my client, and I&#39;m wondering if anyone knows how to add the items, get an item id list, or whatever. If you help, I&#39;ll give rep.</description>

              <p>If you read stormcutters tutorial on how to remove them that would help, but here’s an idea, open up your item.cfg, that has every item on your server, and maybe some custom ones, if you used a base source with them, or just google, “RuneScape private server item ID list,” that works.</p>
