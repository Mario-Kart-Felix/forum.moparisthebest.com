    <title>2 suggestions, Request an award and a new homepage</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-suggestions-request-an-award-and-a-new-homepage/83282</link>
    <description>Suggestion 1:

I think there should be a board/official topic for requesting an award that wont harm your chances. Kind of like going and applying for a job.

Personally, I believe that I deserve the Web Developer cup because of my website that I&#39;m working on and the Batman award because I do help and try not to flame anyone.

[quote=&quot;Moparisthebest&quot;]I have noticed that you don&#39;t flame people and seem to be a good person.[/quote]

^ Actual quote from t3H mopar 

Suggestion 2:

I also think that you could use a new homepage mopar ;). Stuff like a page that steals the new news from RuneScape, a new server status page, a download section, etc.

Thats all for now :) I&#39;m too tired to type any thing else lol.</description>

<p>The serverstatus page and the moparscape homepage will be getting a major upgrade soon, just wait and see. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>I agree, there should be a board, but I think all threads/posts there should be made unviewable to everyone but the posters/moderators/administrators. The problem with that, is that there is not a mod out for SMF that supports this. The only reason I think that, is that it should be up to the administrators, not the apliers best friend saying ‘He really deserves this award’.</p>

<p>Also… I think that asking or demanding an award or extra things that is very rare, is just asking for you be removed from the “possible” list.

              <p>well, a new home page might be a good idea, but more of just an modulation of it. We got the same background as the SRL forum I think. And maybe more interactive, and a flash edition maybe,</p>
<p>Also… I think that asking or demanding an award or extra things that is very rare, is just asking for you be removed from the “possible” list. I don’t think highly of themselves if they think they had already earned it, and I am the one to give it to them, but I think differently, and alters my opinion.</p>

              <p>I disagree with the request an award idea, simply because random people would be requesting every cup in hope they would maybe get lucky and win one on a fluke or something, or it may make them steal others work for there own and try to win it with that. I like the way cups are being awarded as of now, but I think they should be awarded a bit more often.</p>

Or the request forum would turn into a spam fest, <span class="bbcode-b">which I wouldn’t doubt because of moparscape</span>. Although if proper actions were taken to prevent the spamming the idea sounds like a good one.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>The bolded was something that was unneeded. And also, the best way to prevent spam is to lock it. I think with the number of current Global Moderators, spam is not a very hard thing to handle at the moment.[/quote]<br>
haha, that was really needed, I wasn’t implying that everyone from moparscape is a spammer I’m just saying that a lot are immature and would abuse the system.</p>
