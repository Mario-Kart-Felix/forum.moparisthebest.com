    <title>Damn irc wont work for me again :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/damn-irc-wont-work-for-me-again/1930</link>
    <description>Ok well if any of you are from codestream then you may have noticed I was pretty active lately in it. That was because before I could not connect, even though the proper ports were opened and everything and then I formatted my computer and all of a sudden it worked again. So now I downloaded zonealarm, and it seems to me that the second I downloaded it irc has stopped working again. I made sure it allowed access to irc, and it did. But it just wont connect to codestream or hardly any other server. I un-installed zonealarm and yet it still doesn&#39;t work. I did a hard-reset on my router, and it worked again. So then the next day it stopped working again, for some reason everytime I connect to the internet(thus getting a new IP) irc gets blocked again, otherwise I have to manually set up my router just so I can go on for a day. Zone alarm seems to have messed up my internet since there are a lot of other things I can;t connect even though I gave them access. So, how can I allow things have access through zone alarm, whenever they have already been granted access? Does anyone else have issues with zone alarm?</description>

              <p>The weird thing is, when i do a hard-reset on my router then it works again. As soon as I restart my comp or internet then it stops working again. I love the irc, I hate that i can’t get in there.</p>
