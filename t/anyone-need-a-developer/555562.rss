    <title>Anyone Need a Developer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-need-a-developer/555562</link>
    <description>Hello, So long story shot, I used to make Minecraft plugins and sell them.

Made a Decent Amount with that, Now i have a Job doing web development for businesses with 500 or less employees.

But as a side thing I would like to do is Dev for Rsps Servers.

Can I code ? Of course lmao 

Do i know EVERYTHING about Java Script ? Just about lol

Can i also make websites and do GFX ? Yes

Anyways, If you want a serious Dev, just let me know.

Oh yea i forgot, I dont want any proceeds from the Donations 

So pm me on the forums or msg me on twitter at www.twitter.com/driftay

thanks, Drifty

<p>Are there any private servers in javascript? NONE THAT I KNOW OF<br>
so does it matter? PROBABLY NOT<br>
what are the odds that you know EVERYTHING about an entire programming language? ABOUT 0<br>
so how about you fuck off and go do your fucking job</p>
