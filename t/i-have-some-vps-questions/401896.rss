              <p>get a vps dont unblock ur ports your pc will be down in out quick, people like to hack others who do that. cheapest vps is <a href="http://dewlance.com" rel="nofollow noopener">dewlance.com</a>, only 12 a month for their cheapest it can hold up to 20 players that is good for a starting server u need to turn firewalls off and need to disable security for it to work took me like 20 min to figure out but all ports are open firewall jus blocks it</p>

              <p>To create the website, find a webhost or some free forums you want and do whatever you want to set them up.</p>
<p>For the webhost, you don’t need a vps, you just need some money for the site to host it for you.</p>
<p>I don’t know about the vps, I myself am looking for one too. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>To get a webclient, look here: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,336494.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,336494.0.html</a></p>
<p>You need a site that you can put html codes into.</p>
