    <title>Problem with Server or Client!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-server-or-client/350868</link>
    <description>Hey guys!

I got problem with my client or server. When i download an source and a client i can get on the client and server. But when i click 2 times on something, Floor, Item anything 2 times my client just shut down. This happens when i make my own server. I have Windows 7. I didn&#39;t had this problem when i had Windows xp everything worked perfect.

Is is a bugg or something wrong with the server &amp; client?, Or is just my computer?</description>
