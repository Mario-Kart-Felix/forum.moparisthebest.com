    <description>[b][i][u]Nemesis V2.0![/u][/i][/b]

Information about the server:
Well, I originally started off with a P16 Blitz source, and turned it around, to completely unrecognizable by most people, but it just wasn&#39;t good enough. So I decided to try mixing sources, so I mixed WhiteScape and PimpScape up, and I came up with Nemesis::::Re-Written, with 150 updates, I started getting T2 errors when I tried logging in, so I decided to stop on it for a while. I got extremely bored, and decided to start on a new server, but this time, it&#39;s based off of only TestScape! The name of the server came from a song by Arch Enemy, called Nemesis, kind of self-explainable.

Updates:
1. Fixed Ranging speed, it&#39;s good now
2. Fixed arrows dropping and picking up arrows, also checks for arrows!
3. Fixed Range max hit, currently stands at 26, as I want it to be realistic
4. 100% Ranged FIXED!
5. Magic on NPC&#39;s
6. Magic on Players
7. Changed starting point to Lumbridge, use the portal to leave
8. Change it so when you log in, it says &quot;Welcome &quot;playername&quot; to &quot;servername&quot; etc lol
9. Fixed the Mage bug in TestScape, where it kills you every time you cast a spell
10. Realistic max hits, max with whip is 45, and max with full dharok is 90 (99 str, potted, and prayer)
11. Added in a horrible version of the Duel Arena, I&#39;ll add more to it
12. Featuring 3 100% skills so far
13. Woodcutting-Credits to Sam_Server
14. Mining-Credits to Sam_Server
15. Fletching-Credits to LeScape PK, just missing broad arrows, and Fletch &#39;X&#39;
16. 100% item.cfg
17. 100% item.java
18. Reduced a lot of lag
19. Client
20. Website
21. Client is mandatory!
22. Full Specials
23. Changed the hit bubble
24. Changed the HP bar
25. Took out ALL item commands
26. Took out all TELEPORTING commands
27. Delayed my custom specials, to prevent massing with them
28. Added in a Special Bar
29. Added a GFX strike to my specials
30. Fixed mass clicking with PKing and training
31. No more object training
32. No more shops, except for a couple, they are obsolete
33. Best store bought item is Black
34. Added in drops to nearly every NPC, because stores suck IMO

That&#39;s all of the updates I&#39;ve had within the past two days, I&#39;ve pretty much no-lifed this for a total of probably 30 hours in 2 days, so it might be delayed.

Website information:
www.needapproval.notapprovedyet
I&#39;ll be making a new SMFFORFREE forum, and probably shortening the domain to co.nr, so don&#39;t expect a huge cool website.

Credits
Sam_Server-20%
LeScape PK-10%
Nvi Ible for TestScape-10%
Rest is me, I feel I need to give credits to the people who posted/gave me good tutorials!

If you want to know how I got 100% Fletching, other than Fletch &#39;X&#39;, I got it from LeScape PK because he&#39;s a pimp. I&#39;m also sending him my custom specials, so the deal is even.
