    <title>Is giving out condoms and birth control from the school right?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-giving-out-condoms-and-birth-control-from-the-school-right/228006</link>
    <description>Do you think that giving things such as condoms and birth control to students, encouraging teens to have sex? Or are they doing the only thing they feel they can do to prevent teen pregnancy?

Should the parents be notified if their children have taken any birth control or condoms from the school?

My opinion:
Giving the students such things only proves that they are aware of teen pregnancy. it doesn&#39;t necessarily influence anyone into actually doing it. its your own choice you cant place the blame on the schools after all, they are helping prevent it. This is a form of passive peer pressure. they never tell you to do it, but it might give you ideas.

Whats yours?</description>

<p>Well I refuse to have sex with my girlfriend until she gos on birth-control. I would rather be safe then have a baby at 16, note. I would still use a condom, I would just like the extra security of knowing that the birth-control would help reduce the % if it did break. But back on topic, I think it would just be a bit wearied being like <span class="bbcode-b">“oh im having sex, oh your having sex here you go”</span> and its only like $5 for a 3 pack of condoms, so yeah.</p>

<p>That reminds me of a story.  A good friend of mine’s ex-girlfriend was caught in my good friends room with her shirt off, as his mom walked in.  His mom is really dependent on her husband, so she goes and gets him to deal with him.  He comes into to talk to him and throws him a pack of condoms and says “in case you run out” and leaves.  I fucking laughed pretty hard at that, and just thought I’d share it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Should the parents be notified if their children have taken any birth control or condoms from the school?</p>
<p>My opinion:<br>
Giving the students such things only proves that they are aware of teen pregnancy. it doesn’t necessarily influence anyone into actually doing it. its your own choice you cant place the blame on the schools after all, they are helping prevent it. This is a form of passive peer pressure. they never tell you to do it, but it might give you ideas.</p>
<p>Whats yours?<br>
[/quote]<br>
That sort of reminds me of ASH/Church of Euthanasia… “we’re not encouraging suicide, we’re just showing those who are already planning to how to do it right so they don’t end up braindead/disabled/etc”. Anyways, I’d like to know if my kids were, and encourage them to do it safely. Of course I’d still try to push them to abstinence…</p>
<p>Sorry for the 12 day bump.[/quote]lol, 12 day bump made me laugh. Anyways, i guess thats kinda relative. (The ash thing) Except for the fact that its a win lose situation with the condoms, as the suicide thing is lose lose…</p>

<p>Reaper, schools aren’t encouraging kids to have sex by giving out condoms and birth control. It’s SAFE sex they’re promoting.</p>
