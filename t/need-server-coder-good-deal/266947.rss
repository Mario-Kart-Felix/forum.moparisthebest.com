    <title>Need Server Coder - Good deal</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-server-coder-good-deal/266947</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m currently looking for a server coder.  So I can move along faster in my project.  I&#39;m currently looking for someone that is well experienced and can code pretty well.  At the end of the project you can get $50.00 USD - $100.00 USD In pay pal, western union, or the mail(Not a good choice with the mail)  You will also get 50% profits I actually make from the server.  By selling Administrator for a range of 5.00 - 10.00 USD.  Yes, a lot of my friends do buy Administrator so each time they buy it for 10 dollars you get 5 dollars in the mail  But you have to be on a lot if I need you and you have to actually fix/do what I say when I need it.  If something comes up family wise I don&#39;t really care because family is family and you can&#39;t be on if somethings wrong.  The $50.00 - $100.00 USD depends on how well you code and how much you actually do for me.

NOTE:  If this Project turns out better then I thought you can get over $100.00.  Do you know why I would pay that much?  Mostly because I love to have the best of things, I&#39;m sorry but that&#39;s the way I like it but it will never happen.  There will always be something/someone better.

Thanks,
Justin</description>

              <p>Hello, you don’t have to be rude about this.  I also can code really good actually but the thing is rate now a medical condition and with school is stopping me from coding.  I broke 2 of my fingers playing football and yes these messages take a while to type.  I’ve been keeping my server up to date but it takes a while so therefor 1-2 updates a day really minor.  I really need a coder because of this reason and school I’m in advanced classes so they give me more homework…and I’m saying to myself WTF!! why give more homework if your smarter.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
