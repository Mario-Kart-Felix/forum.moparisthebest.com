    <description>At Duke University, specialist Doris Taylor has found a way to deceive nature, reports CBS News Correspondent John Roberts .In experiments with rabbits, she has discovered a way to take the lifeless scar tissue from a heart attack and make it live again.&quot;Nature has provided all of us with a way to do this specific and we have finally merely gotten smart enough to know how to take advantage of the and exploit the idea,&quot; says Taylor.At birth, nature gives us pretty much all the heart tissue we will ever have. If they&#39;re injured -- as in heart failure -- they die and don&#39;t regenerate. Taylor takes a handful of cells of muscle from the leg -- muscle that will repair themselves -- and grows these in the laboratory. And then she injects them directly into the damaged location of the heart. In rabbit hearts, skeletal muscle cells started operating like heart tissues within a few days.&quot;They, at a minimum improved 40 percent and infrequently would get a 4x improvement in their capacity to squeeze,&quot; states Taylor.Even after a moderate cardiac arrest, the damage done can lead to heart failure. The sole currently available option is any heart transplant. Yet surgeons are confident -- if muscle cell transplants work as well within humans as they apparently in animals -- the need for many cardiovascular transplants could be avoided.&quot;If we can prevent congestive heart failing, you don&#39;t need a implant -- you don&#39;t lose your skill to be mobile and you don&#39;t lose what you can do to function in the world,In . says Taylor. Doris Taylor Taylor hopes to test her treatment throughout humans waiting for heart transplants within a year -- and a lot of scientists believe that in just a decade this approach can become part of the standard remedy for treating a heart attack.
