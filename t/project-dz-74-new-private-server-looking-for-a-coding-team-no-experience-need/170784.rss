    <description>[center]Project DZ-74[/center]

DZ-74 is a new server, that is looking for coders. A hoster and someone that could make a webclient is also needed. We dont have any requirements that you is a java expert. We want java expert too, but we want peopls that knows next to nothing about java, so we can learn together and make an awesome runescape private server! Sounds like something for you? Then keep reading.

[center]Source[/center]

We shall use a very plain source, so we can build up so much as possible from scratch.


____________________________________________________________________________________________

[center]How it shall look like when done[/center]

It shall be a PKing server, and without 1-hit-for-185 xp rate. Players shall be proud when they finally get the max skill :) The best items will require max skill in ex attack or defense. It shall be a server that will be fun for everyone to play. And now when Jagex have ruined Runescape, I hope that many players will start playing Private servers, and that they will see us as kind of a replacement for &quot;real Runescape&quot;. I know that there is many other servers that is awesome in all ways. But we want to have a server better then them. But for that we need all help we can get! So I hope that you join, so we can become all that!
