    <description>Requirements:
Administrative Abilities
Windows 7 Home Basic and Up
Basic Task Manager Knowledge
[hr /]
[i][b]Basic Information:[/b][/i]
This is not a hard thing to do, and i recommend keeping a restore point before you do this. I am not responsible for any mishaps but i will try and help fix them if any errors occure, allthough there is almost no chance of this happening.
[hr /]
[i][b]Step 1: Becoming Familiar with the Explorer.exe.[/b][/i]
This is probably the most familiar face in the task manager, explorer.exe is basically the entire gui of your computer. It&#39;s location will be in &quot;C:\Windows\explorer.exe&quot; and i do [b][u]NOT[/u][/b] recommend editing it or replacing it. What we are going to do is simply over-rule it with the use of task manager. Therefore we will now discuss step 2.
[i][b]Step 2: The Windows 7 Theme and all its Friends.[/b][/i]
There are two types of themes for windows 7, the editing of the gui, and the entire explorer.exe mod. We are discussing the 3rd party explorer.exe modding. I warn you though, this can be a dangerous spot, so before we continue make sure you have a virus scanner, if not i recommend &quot;avira free&quot; which you can get bellow.

And also you may need something to open RAR files, like 7zip
[img]http://www.7-zip.org/7ziplogo.png[/img]
[url=http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sevenzip/7z920.exe] Download 7zip (if necessary)[/url]
[hr /]
So now that we have covered the safety issue we now go on the web to discover a new theme, [url=http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/download-windows-7-themes/](downloads) 26 Windows Themes (recommended)[/url]. I have decided to select &quot;Windows 7 Skull Visual Style&quot; so i click on the image which takes me to a &quot;Deviant Art&quot; site, just go to where it says &quot;Download ZIP&quot; or &quot;Download RAR&quot;, download it, open it, and place it on your desktop.

We are now finished with step 2.
[i][b]Step 3: Finally Editing Everything.[/b][/i]
Now we can finally finish. Open the folder that you just placed on your desktop. If it has a place that says &quot;Visual Style&quot; or  &quot;Theme Files&quot; this is usually where you can find the explorer.exe. It should have a 64x and 86x explorer.exe, if you have a computer that runs on a 64bit operating system then the 64x is for you. However if you don&#39;t have a 64bit operating system, then you have a 32bit operating system, and therefore you use the explorer.exe with the 86x on it. FIRST double click the .theme file and load it. SECOND open up task manager. Finally THIRD go to explorer.exe and terminate the process, then go to file&gt;new task, and open your new explorer.exe. You are now finished!

[u][b][i]DO NOT REPLACE ANY EXPLORER.EXE FILES[/i][/b][/u]
My Desktop Currently:

Updates:
Skull theme doesn&#39;t work well with 64bit.
You can search &quot;windows 7 themes&quot; in deviant art, and several themes appear.</description>
