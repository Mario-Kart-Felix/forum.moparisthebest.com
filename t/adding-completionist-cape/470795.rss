    <title>Adding Completionist Cape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-completionist-cape/470795</link>
    <description>Ok well i was adding a completionst cape...I did everything correct...Models in cache-Raw and ints in itemdef and added it into item.cfg..I got a error of item id does not exist so i replaced the case and the item id in item.cfg with 1031 (for some cape that is weird) and when i spawn it its still the regular 1031 cape.

I am willing to pay if thats what it takes...Add me on skype Rspsdesigner.</description>
