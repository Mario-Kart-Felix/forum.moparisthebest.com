    <description>[size=12pt][b]This is not my work this is the work of scott perretta.
Im releaseing this because he quit rsps so i guess i might aswell release It . Remember i haven&#39;t done anything to the source i just found it floating around on my desktop. this was released before a Long time ago . so why not just release it again since he stopped playing? come on we can improve this much more&#39; since all the minigames are working perfectly.. ][/b][/size]

[size=8pt][b]Server Summary: 
The server Virtue, is going to be a server that outdoes any server that is currently online. I am making this server, to give players of this community, the best gaming experience they can possibly have, on a private server. This server will have so much to do, that even when maxed, they cannot get bored.



Our XP rate on this server is 20X runescape, which is the perfect amount to level up faster than runescape, while feeling a very good sense of accomplishment. The XP rate is designed to give you a small challenge, when maxing out your levels, and gives you a much harder challenge to reach that 200M marker.

This server will be advertised and hosted when finished, and while this is online, my goal is to make everyone, play a server they can have fun on![/b][/size]


[b]Virtue&#39;s Economy: 
After giving it alot of thought, people don&#39;t like that hard of an economy. The economy of Virtue will be very stable, and will involve alot of skilling/trading. Here is the basic format of what it is going to be.

You can buy base supplies from a shop (seeds for example). With those base supplies, you will have to make the herbs, which will then make the potions. This way, you just can&#39;t buy potions, which there is no sense of accomplishment in. This is less strict then my old one, which you would have to actually thieve the seeds, which for a server, is a bit extreme. But I do still want this economy, so there is a very stable market.[/b]

[b]Universal Skilling: 

In Virtue, we will have something called universal skilling. Which basically means, instead of having a zone designed specifically for skilling, we will make it so you can skill anywhere on Virtue. That means you can roam to anywhere across Virtue, and chop down trees/ mine some rocks depending on the locations in RS. 

What this allows a player to do, is get a good feel of real skilling rathe than easy, 5 minute skilling. This will add a level of difficulty when getting those 99&#39;s also![/b]

              <p>Dude i know this isn’t mine to release but the owner had it released once or twice . and then he stopped it but it’s hes own fault for doing that so.  why not allow the rest of the world to use it when there are around 1000 other people using it .<br>
This can be improved much much more because it has all the minigames working 100% and all the skills are working perfectly aswell . this is a great base it’s the owner’s fault for releasing this once and then he should have known if he deleted it people would make backup of it because it’s such a good base and all that .</p>
