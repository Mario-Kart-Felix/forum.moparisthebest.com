    <title>ID #&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/id-s/545764</link>
    <description>I used this code to get the ID #&#39;s for my teleports to change the teleport names. It worked for all of them except Ardougne, Watchtower, Trollheim, Etc... But now many of my basic magic spells and attack styles are appearing as ID #&#39;s. How do I get these ID #&#39;s to be hidden again? I commented out this code, but it is still showing for certain strings. [code]for(int i = 0; i &lt; 20000; i++) {
     c.getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;ID: &quot; + i, i);
}
c.sendMessage(&quot;Done printing&quot;);[/code]

How do I get the ID #&#39;s of the teleports that are appearing normally and won&#39;t show the ID #&#39;s and how do I get the ID #&#39;s to hide all together?</description>

<p>Just take that code out that I gave you. it’s just for dumping the id’s. You take note of the ones you want/need and then you remove it. When you restart the server <span class="bbcode-b">and</span> client, all the strings will be reset to what they should be. You have to restart both because some ID’s are never changed by the server, except for the one time you ran that bit of code. So you need to run the client so they reload from the cache/code. Restarting the server after removing that code is so it doesn’t resend all the id’s again.</p>

<p>Okay, I did not restart my client, but that makes sense. I am still wondering about the few teleports that did not change to ID’s and the ancient teleports all did not change? Do I have to be on the ancients tab before I login? But I still want to be able to get the Watchtower teleport ID.<br>

Just change the 20000 to a higher number, chances are it’s a id it didn’t catch.[/quote]</p>
<p>Haha, kinda figured it was something as simple as that. Good looking out, I appreciate your help!</p>
