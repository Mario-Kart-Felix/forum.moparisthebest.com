              <p>Download a source. To make your training fast, make all your XP rate’s like 2000 or 3000. To make a weapon 1 hit, you have to edit the bonuses in item.cfg.</p>
<p>Changing home location is usually in player.java or client.java.</p>
<p>It’s nearly impossible to make your own source from scratch unless you’re an experienced programmer and know what you’re during 100%.</p>
