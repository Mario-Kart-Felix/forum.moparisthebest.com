    <title>Shell accounts</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shell-accounts/162800</link>
    <description>Hello, I have some questions about these shell accounts. I would like to make some on my home computer so I can ssh and tunnel to them remotely. I have one from http://jaguar.garofil.be/ but it stopped me from tunneling recently. Can anyone help?
Thanks
Justis
EDIT: Never mind, I think i found it.
