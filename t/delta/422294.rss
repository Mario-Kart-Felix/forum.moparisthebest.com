    <description>I have a 317 delta and I&#39;m trying to get it so other people can play it, whenever they try to play it, it says error connecting to server when they login, I have a no-ip IP, whenever I check to see if it&#39;s online it says online, but I don&#39;t think it downlaods the cache for them, so what do I do?</description>

              <p>If it does not download the cache properly then send them the download link or above say “If the cache is not downloading properly, Click Here” or something like that. I used dropbox for my webhost before i started using Host Gator.<br>
If it is not letting them connect but it is downloading the cache then make sure you are fully portforwarded and there is nothing blocking the ports.(Firewalls)<br>
My friend had the same problem but when i used TeamViewer i found out that both his ports were not the same. His client had 5555 and his source had 43594 and he didn’t notice that…</p>
