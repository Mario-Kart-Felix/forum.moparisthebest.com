    <title>Help With Game (JavaScript)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-game-javascript/344219</link>
    <description>I do not intend to break any rules by posting this in this section of the forums.
This has nothing to do with RSPS regardless of what people say.

I wanted to ask for some help.. I recently visited a site and downloaded one of their products call Unity3D. Unity3D is excellent and can create all sorts of games. But let me get to my point here, i was on unity creating games and decided to build a mmorpg. I did my best and im still working on it but a question came to my mind. How will people play my game and i did some stuff but i have one bad problem. I need to learn how to set up a database that will allow me to save the players information when they log off and send it back when they want to log in...

So i came here to ask, If someone would make a tutorial on how to set up a database for this situation and  how to make a loginbox for them to load their character.

It would be great if someone had a free way to do this because i am already spending a large budget.</description>
