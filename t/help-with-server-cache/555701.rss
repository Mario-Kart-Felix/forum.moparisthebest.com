    <title>Help with Server Cache</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-server-cache/555701</link>
    <description>Hello.

I am having some problems with my Client being able to be ran on another computer.

Within the File I downloaded, it came with the Client/Source/Cache &amp; an Auto-Cache Downloader.

I put the Cache in the C:Drive but left the Auto-Cache in the Folder as I am unsure what to do with it.

I got told to edit my signlink.java but I still do not fully understand what to edit for it to successfully work.

I&#39;m really confused with what I need to do with my Cache and what is the point in this Auto-Cache Downloader?

All thanks will be highly appreciated. I&#39;ve only recently started working with RSPS and Java and am looking to gain some experience.</description>

              <p>Yeah so basically what an “auto cache-downloader” does is allow the server owner to update the cache files when the client needs to.</p>
<p>signlink does more than i understand, but the part youre talking about is where the java class tells the client (signlink.java) to look for the cache.</p>
<p>if your auto cache downloader thing downloads to point X the client needs to look in point X to read the cache file.</p>
<p>its honestly just a few strings that need to be changed. you should be able to find them if you have any sense</p>
