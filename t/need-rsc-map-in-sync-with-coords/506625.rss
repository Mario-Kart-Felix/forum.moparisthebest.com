    <title>Need RSC map in sync with coords</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-rsc-map-in-sync-with-coords/506625</link>
    <description>I&#39;m attempting to write an anywhere walker for RSC.  In order to do so, I&#39;m going to want a rsc map image that is perfectly aligned with real rsc coordinates.  I&#39;ve used the RSC Map Generator, and a couple other things, but the coordinates seem off in certain places (and not just by a constant).  

If anyone could shed some light on how I should go about doing this, or if anyone has such an image, I&#39;d greatly appreciate it.</description>

              <p>Thanks a lot.  This will help a ton.</p>
<p>In case anyone’s wondering, with the rsc map images flipped so the x axis is in reverse, every 3 pixels coordinates with 1 coord in the game (or so it seems).</p>

Works on a highway system, thats why the path isn’t always the most direct.  As I see bad paths I can add extra highways in.  That path above took less than a second to generate.</p>

              <p>Actually, the map generator flips the image a long the X axis, not only for each sector, but the final image. By not flipping the final image, it should output the map with the origin on the top left of the image, rather than the top right.</p>
