<p>“server name” -&gt; characters -&gt; open your name -&gt; character-rights = 0</p>
<p>change to -&gt;<br>
1 = mod<br>
2 = admin<br>
3 = owner</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>see 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exp does not work ? what server did u use as base?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>search for “npc.cfg”<br>
looking at the following code u will understand.<br>
//    NpcID     NpcName                         combat  health	respawn<br>
npc = 0		Hans				0	0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look in tutorial section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it could be only players with the right “player-rights” can use them or when its like :<br>
command.equalsIgnoreCase(“supra s”)<br>
its name based only the player with that name can access the code</p>
</li>
