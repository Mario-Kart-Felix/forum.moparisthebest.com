              <p>I don’t understand why no reported a topic like this.</p>
<p>The reason you didn’t most likely because your grammar is pretty bad, but even for the fact that your errors consisted of errors YOU made. Portforwarding, “compiling issues”, and having “bad login”. If you ever read this, I’m sorry that you were mistreated, but try to make your topics more clear so others can read it.</p>
<p>If any other problems occur PM me or another staff member.</p>

First of all, I must comment on your English. It’s terrible. Second, if you weren’t so stupid, you could teach yourself java as I did. It’s not that hard, it is extremely easy to pick up on.</p>

<p>People here aren’t 20+ people who have college majors in java like on Rune-Server… Majority of the people here (or so I’ve observed) are within the ages of 15 - 17 so they don’t have majors in java… That and this isn’t a very helpful community in the first place… :I[/quote]</p>
<p>You are soooo mistaken about Rune-server bro. They are all out casts of moparscape. Rune-server is full of people who <span class="bbcode-b">think</span> they have college majors in java.</p>
<p>OT: You probably didn’t provide enough info for anyone to help you, or something like that.</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>I looked at your thread.</p>
