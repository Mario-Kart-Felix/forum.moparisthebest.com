    <description>Well, I wanted to create this thread because I want to see if others like poetry as much as I do, it takes out a lot of emotions from me and I enjoy doing it, here what I have so far as far as having poems and what not:

[B][U]I Love You[/U][/B]
[QUOTE]The sound of your voice is music to my ears, so soft, sweet, and clear.
The kiss from your lips words can not explain
It takes away my worries and pain
The caress of your hand sends shiver down my spine
Everyday I thank God that your mind

The sight of your lovely face takes away all my worries
You&#39;re the one I want to love through out the years
For eternity I want to send in your arms
Everyday graced by your beauty and charms[/QUOTE]

[B][U]Dying Inside[/U][/B]
[QUOTE]Something so hard
Goes straight to the soul;
It seems impossible to get over
My heart is left with a big hole

I&#39;m trying to be happy, wearing a smile, but I&#39;m in fact dying inside
The world seems to be fading, I want to run and hide

Everywhere I go I see the pain
I see the ending road
I see... the answer
The truth to be told
I see the opening gate
I see the death of dreams[/QUOTE]

[B][U]Down Again[/U][/B]
[QUOTE]I&#39;ve been pushed down so many times
I feel this time will be the end, as I lay here dying
My thoughts are to an end 

I feel the pressure of shame, sadness, and rejection building as I fall
Not the strength to get up
I feel the need to fall
I crave the need to burn, to ash if I could
I&#39;m not even worth it anymore, I do say if I could[/QUOTE]

[B][U]This poem does NOT have a title[/U][/B]
[QUOTE]We all want a bit of peace
Something we cannot keep
Wherever the world takes us
There is but the slightest of thee
We cannot comprehend such pain
Though we cannot stop at such paths
Our will continues to drive us
Though our physical body will always stop us
We will always strive for that feeling
Of Peace and Harmony[/QUOTE]

[B][I]Dark[/I][/B]
[QUOTE]I float in a pool of darkness
Cold presses upon me
I am but alone in such a dark world
Floating aimlessly
I reach for spark of hope
But rather than warm, I sense burn and ashes

I ache with sorrow and hunger to leave
I strive for escape
To leave this prison as free as I can be
To crave to be free as free as I can be
To be heard as free as I can scream
To be loved as free as I can deem[/QUOTE]

[B][U]Broken[/U][/B]
[QUOTE]In my soul lyes a broken crack
A piece that can not come back
What can I do, nothing but live my hell
The grief
The crying

To what may consume me
I lay there dying of it
In a wheatherless place
Nothing but Hell

As I wake
I lay my eyes upon the Devil
With him doing....
My soul to take

I bum with nothing but a broken heart[/QUOTE]

And here is the latest one I&#39;ve written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[CENTER][B]Oh my darling is buy away
Her pain is gone but I worry
I plan on seeing her again on day
Nothing Keeps me here although I stay

I smile as I see the sunrise come up
Oh I bless the heavens for seeing her again
But oh how I sadly frown as she goes down
And I get on my knees and say amen

Oh the sunrise may leave us about one day
And as I lay crying and to dye madly
I wait and see how to get to her way
God suddenly warms me and says goodbye[/B][/CENTER]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, I understand that some people are not into poems and stuff, so short stories can be shared as well, I don&#39;t mind at all!</description>

              <p>This is a poem I’ve been working on for two days, this poem resembles my grandmother because she said she ALWAYS loved butterflies.</p>
<p>[QUOTE][CENTER]<br>
You are a butterfly<br>
Smile, flourish, and fly<br>
You kept me with a heartbeat<br>
How could I die?</p>
<p>You lifted me off my feet<br>
Sorrow came to me when you said goodbye<br>
Miss you I always will, hope to see you go by<br>
Tears will run down my eye, as a butterfly goes by</p>
<p>Your voice kept me alive<br>
There was no way I could die<br>
Whenever I was to fall<br>
You came and lifted me up</p>
<p>Now dear butterfly; fly away<br>
Go home and watch with the angels<br>
You deserve a millenium in Heaven<br>
Don’t worry dear dear butterfly, just fly fly away<br>

              <p>Tim Burten always has such magical music.</p>
<blockquote>What's this? What's this? 
There's color everywhere
What's this? 
There's white things in the air
What's this? 
I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, jack, this isn't fair
What's this?
<p>What’s this? What’s this?<br>
There’s something very wrong<br>
What’s this?<br>
There are people singing songs</p>
<p>What’s this?<br>
The streets are lined with<br>
Little creatures laughing<br>
Everybody seems so happy<br>
Have I possibly gone daffy?<br>
What is this?<br>
What’s this?</p>
<p>There are children throwing snowballs here<br>
instead of throwing heads<br>
They’re busy building toys<br>
And absolutely no one’s dead</p>
<p>There’s frost on every window<br>
Oh, I can’t believe my eyes<br>
And in my bones I feel the warmth<br>
That’s coming from inside</p>
<p>Oh, look<br>
What’s this?<br>
They’re hanging mistletoe, they kiss<br>
Why that looks so unique, inspired<br>
They’re gathering around to hear a story<br>
Roasting chestnuts on a fire<br>
What’s this?<br>
What’s this?</p>
<p>In here they’ve got a little tree, how queer<br>
And who would ever think<br>
And why?</p>
<p>They’re covering it with tiny little things<br>
They’ve got electric lights on strings<br>
And there’s a smile on everyone<br>
So, now, correct me if I’m wrong<br>
This looks like fun<br>
This looks like fun<br>
Oh, could it be I got my wish?<br>
What’s this?</p>
<p>Oh my, what now?<br>
The children are asleep<br>
But look, there’s nothing underneath<br>
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them<br>
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things<br>
Secure inside their dreamland<br>
What’s this?</p>
<p>The monsters are all missing<br>
And the nightmares can’t be found<br>
And in their place there seems to be<br>
Good feeling all around</p>
<p>Instead of screams, I swear<br>
I can hear music in the air<br>
The smell of cakes and pies<br>
Is absolutely everywhere</p>
<p>The sights, the sounds<br>
They’re everywhere and all around<br>
I’ve never felt so good before<br>
This empty place inside of me is filling up<br>
I simply cannot get enough</p>
<p>I want it, oh, I want it<br>
Oh, I want it for my own<br>
I’ve got to know<br>
I’ve got to know<br>
What is this place that I have found?<br>
What is this?<br>
Christmas Town, hmm…</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>This is an unfinished short story.</p>
<p>‘Why don’t you just go back, it was quieter here when you were gone!’ Eric heard his mother shout as he cowered in his bedroom, ‘You’re nothing but ungrateful, all of you are ungrateful!’ he heard the steps of someone approaching down the hall. ‘How about you shut up and leave me alone, I didn’t come here to be yelled at by you!’ screamed his sister. The door swung open and his sisters bright red face appeared through the door way ‘I’m leaving, I’ll see you later’, he nodded and she closed the door. The footsteps continued down the hall until he heard the front door shut, he’d never expected this to happen 2 months ago but it was and he couldn’t stop it.</p>
<p>Eric was a slim, 17 year old boy who lived in a house with his father. His mother had left them when they were young so he never knew her, up until recently. His mother had shown up at their door with her bags and a new husband, Eric’s step father, Andy, who he refused to call his step father. His mothers name was Kate and he father’s was Robert, he had an elder sister called Jamie and a younger brother called Paul.</p>
<p>When his mother turned up that night, Eric had no idea who she was. He could only remember his mother as a bright, young women with sun dyed blonde hair and brown eyes, and now at his front door he saw a hopeless, gray haired women. Behind her stood a gray haired man a few inches taller then her and fairly chubby, Eric thought it was a stranger until his father invited them in.</p>
<p>‘Eric, come in here’ called Robert, ‘you have to meet someone’ Eric approached slowly, not taking his eyes off Kate. ‘Don’t look at me like that, come give me a hug’ Kate said with a toothless smile, a smile he could only remember vaguely. In an instant Kate had wrapped her arms around him and began embracing him, awkwardly he hugged back until she let go. ‘You look so old now, I can’t believe how much you’ve grown’ Kate commented, Eric responded with a puzzled look. His father had noticed his facial expression and finally spoke ‘this is your mother, Kate, remember?’, ‘no, I don’t’ he lied, he turned and walked away knowing that 3 pairs of eyes watched him.</p>
<p>At this point he was only 16, and it was November. The Christmas holidays were about to begin but he wasn’t looking forward to them, his father has allowed Kate and Andy to stay at their place until they could get their feet on the ground. Eric didn’t like the idea, and neither did his eldest sister, Jamie. They had had resentment toward their mother for years and they weren’t about to stop, sure she was their mother but she had ruined their lives.</p>
<p>They weren’t rich, they barely had enough to survive each week but his father made it happen. His father was a single dad working with the local council as a gardener, his pay was just enough to tide them over without any extras. This left Eric with second hand clothes from opportunity shops and older relatives; he never liked wearing second hand goods but had no choice. At the time it was the best his father could do and he respected that, but he always felt like the odd one out.</p>
<p>After the holidays Kate moved out with Andy, they had moved a few houses away and Eric for the first time in 4 months was happy. His mother had moved out and he didn’t have to deal with her anymore, which is the way he liked it. His sister Jamie was pleased with this decision; she now had her own ‘Kate free space’ and was enjoying it. Paul on the other hand didn’t really like it, but that was just how Paul was.</p>
<p>Paul was young when his mother had left but he never seemed to blame her for it, he always said that his mother was a great person and that he wished she’d come back. When the time came Paul was about the happiest you would have ever seen him, a great big smile on his face and bright eyes every time he would talk to her. To him she was his mum, and that’s all he needed. Paul was only 6 when his mother had left him; he thought she was going on a trip. Little did he know the trip would be 9 years long, and that she would find a new husband during her journey. He liked Andy as well, thought of him as a second father, which he was, but he had accepted it.</p>
<p>In May of that year Kate and Andy had moved again, this time further away. They had moved a few blocks further and were getting on with their own lives, but still trying to interact with Jamie and Eric. Paul still liked that they were around the area and was still walking around with a smile on his face after visiting them, a lot of the times even before he visited them. Robert began to put his trust in Kate and Andy and was spending about as much time with them as he could, after work and on weekends. It was like he couldn’t get enough of them, Eric didn’t understand how he did this. ‘His mother, who had abandoned his father, she betrayed him and left him with three kids and he still wanted her in his life’ Eric would think to himself ‘does he still love her? Why can’t he get a grip and just let go, make it a better place for everyone’.</p>
<p>Over the 9 years of taking care of his three children alone, Robert had lost all contact with his old friends. He only had time to work and spend time with the kids, which wasn’t surprising because kids can be tough a lot of the times. Robert only had 1 friend he kept in contact with; he was an old mate from primary school. Before Kate turned up, he would hang out with his friend, Josh, and have a couple beers on the weekend. They would watch Paul ride around on his bike in the back, Jamie would be on her swing and Eric would just sit around patting their only dog, spot. Once Kate turned up a tension between Robert and Josh started, Josh didn’t agree with letting Kate live with them but it only caused chaos between the two. Robert told Josh he could handle it on his own but josh knew otherwise and just let it go, Robert now had no friends and looked toward Kate and Andy for friendship.</p>
<p>By September that year Kate and Andy had moved back in with Eric and his family; Eric didn’t have a word in the matter and was forced to retreat to his room because of them. This also happened to Jamie, who had in the past couple of months picked up enough courage to argue with anyone and everyone she pleased. Eric wasn’t like that though; he always seemed to respect people older then him but these people didn’t deserve it. ‘When has she ever respected me? When has she respected me sister or my brother or even my father!’ he would think to himself every night before bed, he could only dream about building up the courage to fight back.</p>
<p>In early December Eric was told that his Robert, Kate and Andy had decided they wanted to move, Eric rebelled but nothing could stop it. He was being forced to leave a house he has spent his childhood in, the house he had made memories in, his home. They would all go to waste because of the selfish act of his father, his brainless father, who had allowed his mother back into his life. By this time Eric had picked up enough courage to argue with his father about how idiotic he was being, but his father would shrug it off and ignore him. This infuriated Eric so much that he rebelled against everything he could, everything his father would tell him to do, everything he used help with, even conversations.</p>
<p>By late December the move had taken place and everything was catered to the ‘adults’, leaving Eric and Jamie to support them selves. Every day seemed to become more torturous toward the two; even their father seemed to have something against them. Kate and Andy would talk behind their backs with Robert, although Eric and Jamie heard most of what they said. This caused a burning rage within the two, one that wasn’t going to come out lightly.</p>
<p>And so after that came the fighting between Jamie and Kate, all Kate would argue was that Eric and Jamie were ‘ungrateful’ and ‘selfish’. Eric didn’t want to get involved because his mother could become abusive, he’d never seen her hit anyone but he has seen her hit a wall. Jamie had moved out and only come back to see Eric, they had an exceptional relationship. They would always look after each other because they needed each other, only they understood what went on.</p>
<p>The end of January the next year came and Eric couldn’t strand Kate or Andy anymore he couldn’t even tolerate Robert any longer, Eric couldn’t stand his life being like this. He wanted to escape but every solution couldn’t fit his needs, his family wouldn’t take him because of his father and his friends wouldn’t understand. In February school was going to start and he could get away from the chaos for most of the day, but he always had to come back. He decided he would talk to his friends about the situation and hopefully get a fresh opinion on the topic.</p>
<p>On the last Friday in January Eric walked out into to the kitchen where he grabbed something and place it in his pocket where no one could see it, then walked into the lounge room to find his father. ‘Where is everyone?’ he questioned his father ‘they’re next door’ Robert replied, ‘why are they there?’ ‘because they want to be, now will you go away?’ ‘whatever’ Eric spat as he walked away, he place his hand over the object in his pocket. As he entered the room he shut the door and turned to lock it, he pulled out a steak knife he had taken from the kitchen and placed it on his desk. An opportunity of escape had finally come his way, but in his mind he contemplated the idea. ‘What would they family do if I did it?’ he thought to himself ‘they wouldn’t care! They don’t care now, why would they care later?’ He picked up the knife from his desk; he then opened up his draw and pulled out a bottle of vodka that he has hidden from his parents. ‘Tonight, I won’t make any decisions’ he thought to himself, he then turned off the light and faded into the depth of the room.</p>
<p>When morning came so did a hangover, Eric could barely lift his head. He had finished the whole bottle the night before and turned out that even when he was drunk that he never wanted to harm himself. He knew then that his life meant more to him then he thought, but how was the question. Eric’s energy would not be focused on finding a purpose for his like, something worth living for.</p>
<p>In February school started, Eric had attended school for a week now and still hadn’t brought up the situation with his friends. He had never found the opportunity to do so, Eric was becoming more and more frustrated. On the Thursday the following week his friend, Sally, had noticed how tense he was becoming, the other two mikes and Adam hadn’t though. Sally had known Eric since grade one but had they only met Mike and Adam in sixth grade during orientation at their high school, so it was no surprise to Sally that they had not noticed. Before lunch time had ended Eric had began to become more and more detached with the conversations, he appeared to be staring off toward the sky more then anything else. Sally was becoming overly concerned and spent both 5th and 6th period keeping a close eye on Eric, which he hadn’t noticed at all.</p>
<p>The bell rang and slowly enough Eric made his way toward his locker, Sally had decided to wait for him at the gate so she could talk to him. Mike and Adam passed her first,<br>
‘see ya, sally!’ Adam waved ‘<br>
talk to you tomorrow, ey sally?’ Mike hugged Sally before they both walked off, leaving her to wait for Eric on her own. Eric finally emerged from around the corner minutes later, his eyes on his feet.<br>
‘Hey Eric’ sally spoke first ‘how are you feeling?’<br>
‘Yeah, I’m alright’ he said in a dull tone,<br>
‘I was thinking we could hang out before we go home maybe?’ she asked curiously<br>
‘Oh um, sure’ he agreed, the light in his eyes flickered.<br>
‘Great, I was thinking about getting some chips from the shop as well. Mum doesn’t give me enough food nowadays, thinks I’m still 4 or something’ she joked<br>
A faint smile appeared on Eric’s face, the first smile she had seen all day from him. This made her smile as well; they slowly walked toward the shops while making small talk.</p>
<p>‘So, how is your family doing?’ she questioned<br>
‘Well, you know…’ he drifted off<br>
‘I heard Kate has moved back in with you, how you handling that?’ sally questioned carefully<br>
‘Well you know how parents can be; we all have to live with them’ he said calmly, trying not to indicate that something was wrong.<br>
‘I know that but you’re different, your parents are different’ she watched his face to see a change in expression, which came quicker then she has imagined.<br>
‘Sally, why are you talking about my parents?’<br>
‘Well, I just want to make sure you’re going alright’<br>
‘What makes you think I’m not?’ Anger had appeared on his face, as he stopped to face her.<br>
‘Uh, Eric, lately you haven’t been yourself’ she spoke softly ‘we’ve known each other for along time, and I know when something is wrong. You’ve been focusing more on the sky when you sit outside, and when you walk you’re too busy watching the path then you are where you are going. I’m just worried for you, and I don’t know why I shouldn’t be’ her voice gaining strength.<br>
Eric’s face no longer looked angry but sad, his eyes had drifted downward and his mouth clenched as though trying not to cry. Sally placed her hand on his shoulder and looked at his face waiting for him to look back at her, as he lifted his head she spoke in a serious tone ‘Eric, lets get some food because I am seriously hungry’ she smiled as she turned and walked off, Eric’s mouth had fallen open at her humorous comment and with a smile he followed her into the shop to assist her in buying food.</p>

<p><code>
A duck walked up to a lemonade stand
and he said to the man running the stand
Hey. got any grapes?
The man said no we just sell lemonade.  It’s cold and its fresh and it’s all home made.  Can I sell you glass? The duck said “I’ll pass”. 
Then he waddled away.  Till the very next day.
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And he said to the man that was running the stand
Hey.  You got any grapes?
The man said no, like I said yesterday, we just sell lemonade okay? 
Why not give it a try?   The duck said Goodbye.
Then he waddled away.  He waddled away.  He waddled away
Till the very next day.
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And he said to the man that was running the stand
Hey.  You got any grapes?
The man said look, this is getting old.  Lemonade’s all we’ve ever sold. Why not give it a go?   The duck said “No.”
Then he waddled away.  He waddled away.  He waddled away
Till the very next day.
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And he said to the man that was running the stand
Hey.  You got any grapes?
The man said THAT’S IT!!  If you don’t stay away,duck,  I’ll glue you to a tree and leave you there all day, stuck.
So don’t get to close!  The duck said Adios.
Then he waddled away.  He waddled away.  He waddled away
Till the very next day.
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And he said to the man that was running the stand
Hey.  You got any glue?
What?
You got any glue? 
No, why would I– Oh!
Then one more question for you: 
Got any grapes?
And the man just stopped.  Then he started to smile.  Then he started to laugh.  He laughed for a while. 
Then he said, “Come on duck, let’s walk to the store.  I’ll buy you some grapes so you won’t have to ask anymore.”
So they walked to the store and the man bought some grapes.  He offered one to the duck and the duck said “No thanks”. 
“But you know what sounds good? It would make my day.
Do you think this store, do you think this store, do you think this store…  has any… lemonade?”
Then he waddled away.  He waddled away.  He waddled away.
