    <title>URGANT! NEED HELP! (This may be difficult)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/urgant-need-help-this-may-be-difficult/478155</link>
    <description>OK I am running into a major problem with my server. I have no clue what the problem is?!

Let me lay it down.

I have a server from the InsidiaX source and client. I have edited a lot in the server so it is to how I want the server to be. Anyway I have [u][b]set everything I can see in the server and client files to my ip adress which is 121.***.***.29[/b][/u] I have also [u][b]taken out all of the 127.0.0.1 and replaced them with my server ip.[/b][/u] I have a No-ip so I can get it online and my no-ip is skaarjpk.servergame.com. I also have port forwarded it through my router on port 43594. (I am not sure if that is &#39;MY&#39; port but its the port everyone uses.) I also made it open in utorrent and [u][b]I tested my 43594 port on a website and nothing is blocking it[/b][/u].

The server client has 300+ downloads and there is only 3 or 4 players on ever! I have had a problem with he cache auto downloading so I had to included it with the server client. [b][u]People that download the server have said to me they get an error that said &#39;Error connecting to server&#39;[/u][/b] and once in a blue moon they can connect but then cannot after they log out. So this to me has just said it might be my internet connection. but it is a [b][u]direct connection into a router and never cuts out[/u][/b].


If anyone is willing to help out with this I will be sooo grateful because this is killing me, i&#39;m sure its something simple but I just can&#39;t do it.
I have Team Viewer and Skype.

[u][b]Please anybody help me with this!!! Anybody Give it a go it is just killing me!![/b][/u]</description>

<p>No that is not any of my Ips. What do you mean its linked to ‘the IP’ ? and yeah I just got it running on my computer. is there a way to extend the bandwidth?[/quote]</p>
<p>First, you can extend the bandwidth (or allow more bandwith) by asking your service provider, which may often result in them wanting more money. Unless you have unlimited bandwidth but there are a lot of devices using your internet.</p>
<p>Secondly, No-ip is a 3rd party application that takes a numeric IP such as 8.23.224.90 and turns it into a textual representation such as <a href="http://skaarjpk.servegame.com" rel="nofollow noopener">skaarjpk.servegame.com</a>. This thought is generally to protect from hackers though, I went into cmd and typed ‘ping  <a href="http://skaarjpk.servegame.com" rel="nofollow noopener">skaarjpk.servegame.com</a>’ and it displayed that it is now pinging the numeric IP (8.23.224.90). If  <a href="http://skaarjpk.servegame.com" rel="nofollow noopener">skaarjpk.servegame.com</a> is set to disguise the numeric IP ‘8.23.224.90’ and that’s not your IP, this could be the problem. I’d recommend getting rid of No-IP and instead of typing in <a href="http://skaarjpk.servegame.com" rel="nofollow noopener">skaarjpk.servegame.com</a>, type in your IP to connect to (the 121.***.***.29) let me know if any of these suggestions worked.</p>
