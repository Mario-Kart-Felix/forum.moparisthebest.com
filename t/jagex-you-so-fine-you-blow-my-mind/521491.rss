              <p>The reason I compare it to WoW is yet again because I find it to be the closest formula that Jagex is following, as well as it being basically the brain child for every other MMORPG out there like it. WoW isn’t following other formulas from what I’ve seen, they’re creating them and then MMORPGs are conforming to their standards simply because they’ve managed to profit from it.</p>
<p>Jagex thinks that by mimicking another formula they can regain its playerbase, when instead they are actually pushing people farther away from it, hence why they created 07scape. Jagex doesn’t seem to acknowledge the fact that its their updates that are driving players away, not their base mechanics.</p>

<p>What I think most of us are trying to say is that there was no need to make the changes so that RS looks like WoW, or even other games. Rather than fixing their original system, they sold out and copied the template of all the other generic games, most commonly and easily compared to WoW.<br>
[/quote]This is just me assuming but I wouldn’t be surprised if the LP rising was in preparation of future combat updates(such as the eoc, rework of how prayers, etc work. )[/quote]<br>
Exactly, EoC was just another step towards becoming a generic MMORPG.</p>

<p>It doesn’t really bother me…when a technical institute tries to become a university they too go from three digits to four so go figure :p[/quote]Yes, though - why not add the features to work around their uniqueness? Instead of plummeting deeper into becoming just another generic MMO?</p>
<p>Also - your university argument is invalid. Completely different concept.</p>

There is really no need to compare WoW to RS… It will not change a thing. It’s generic medieval war music.<br>

Runescape is REALLY moving to become more like WoW now though. Its only a matter of time before they remove tile based movement for WASD</p>

THIS, 100%. People who are saying the game isn’t slowly converting into WoW are pretty uneducated when it comes to MMORPGs. They moved their graphics to mimic that of an overhead WoW, which I can’t complain too much as it was a somewhat nice graphical change, albeit the armour looking rather “toony”. They copied the hot bar with special moves. They copied music apparently. They upped the damage and health to mimic the massive amounts of damage dealt and taken. Everything is now single combat (although, yet again they screwed it up and made even the most aggressive beasts in lore passive). Just wait til they start making you pay 40 dollars to unlock the East Lands and what not.</p>
