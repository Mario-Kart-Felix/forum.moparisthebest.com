    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-this-error-code-i-get/438438</link>
    <description>Okay, I&#39;m personally new to Java and decided that RS-PS&#39;s would be a good start.

Anyways, now to business. Here is the image you will be needing to see my, &quot;issue&quot;.

Or, in case that doesn&#39;t work.

If you can help me, I do have Team Viewer on my computer so please reply to this and leave your email address and I will get back to you as soon as possible. I would greatly appreciate any help or tips you may give me, or even criticism. Honestly, I&#39;m open to anything that would help me improve in Java.

Thanks for reading, Anarchy</description>
