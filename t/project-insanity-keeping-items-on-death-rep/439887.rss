    <title>[Project Insanity] Keeping Items On Death (Rep++)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-insanity-keeping-items-on-death-rep/439887</link>
    <description>I was looking for a way that players can keep items on death as well as mods, admins, and owners. Does anyone know how to do this? I tried changing the player rights for the admins keeping items on death in config.java, but that didn&#39;t do anything.

Anyways I want it so when anyone dies, they keep the items that they are wearing and the items in their inventory.</description>

              <p>there should be something like applyDead() and if they are right-worthy, skip the dropping items part? :o</p>
