    <title>Looking for Client-Sided Developer</title>

    <description>[center]Hey MoparScape Users, a friend and I are looking for a Client-Sided Developer. We have Forums Developing and Server-Sided done on lock down but we are just not the best at doing Client Sided things. If you are interested, please drop a comment or send me a pm with your skype in it. 

Only serious inquiries only please. [/center]</description>
