    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xp-rate-discussion/549498</link>
    <description>After looking at the results from the poll for the first alpha, I&#39;m pretty happy to see that the majority of people were okay with the XP rate we had, which was a simple 3x. Because there were a pretty large number of people that voted that it was a bit too slow, for the next alpha I&#39;m going to try out 6x. I&#39;m expecting that this will be too fast, but it&#39;ll be good to see what people think and work from there, maybe come up with a middle ground like 4.5 or something.

You can use this topic to discuss your thoughts from the last alpha, but most of the real discussion will be after the next one.</description>

<p>Honestly, the kind of person who thinks it is fun to run from the Yews in Varrock castle back to the grand exchange 1,000,000 times is someone who needs to visit a doctor. Just go outside, get a job, get a mortgage and play that game.</p>
<p>High exp rate, ridiculous drop rates, retardedly rare super powered items, everything is OP. Potions give you +300 strength when you have 99 herblore. Strength bonuses in the 1000s are commonplace. Items can buff health. Maximum health is more like 10000 and you have to grind the shit out of it to get there. Server resets, account losses, dupes, hacks, bannings etc all don’t matter because start a new account and in 20 minutes you are ready to PK again.</p>
<p>If you don’t like this, why don’t you just play old school RS? If you want to walk everywhere to do quests just play old school RS. Focus on the content, the quests, the combat mechanics. But keep the fun.</p>

<p>Only a year? I thought the Moparscape server was in development when I left! Hahahaha.</p>
<p>Well, I have had a further look Davidi and I must concede what you guys have done is pretty sick. I’m still definitely a firm believer in the mental side of RSPS though. I might go and look for some of them. Good luck with this.</p>

Like I said, the whole “choose your xp” isn’t going to happen.<br>
[/quote]<br>
You haven’t actually said why though, no “discussion” just “no”[/quote]Because it’s such a bad idea that I didn’t even want to waste my time writing up a response for it. I’ll give some quick points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Completely removes competitive aspect of the game, which may completely alienate people who choose lower XP rates because they feel like their time is wasted</li>
<li>Economy is completely unfair as people who get to higher levels faster can get high level materials/items so much sooner</li>
</ol>
<p>Sure you could write code to give people with lower xp rates various bonuses or somehow hinder people with higher xp rates, but if you are doing that then what was the point of the different rates in the first place?</p>
<p>“Choose your own XP rate” pretty much translates to “single player RS”, and if people want that they can host the source locally.</p>
<p>[quote=“Rodgerwilco, post:55, topic:549498”][quote author=sinisoul link=topic=668400.msg4472295#msg4472295 date=1423801308]<br>
I really want to make an executive choice and just implement either a custom or scaling XP rate. The point of this server is to emulate a real game experience, not just let people play their endgame fantasies. The depth of the experience is characterized too by what happens in the early levels.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Which goes back to my suggestion on having the exp rate be based on the slayer skill. 1-10 = 1x Exp, 11-20 = 2x. But possibly keep the slayer skill a constant exp rate?[/quote]I don’t really like that at all. A lot of people dislike slayer or will want to be “skillers”, and it doesn’t seem like a good idea to force anyone to train any skill.</p>
<p>Like sinisoul said, it’s pretty much been decided that the XP rate will be a flat bonus rate or one that scales to make the higher levels be not quite as grindy.</p>

If people want to reach level 99s quickly but you want things like fishing to continue then why not incentivise 200m experience? That’s another approach to consider.<br>

<p>As for my previous post, you could apply the mechanism to the production of primary goods (e.g., ores, bars, etc) and not the production of final products (such as platemail). Mining contest occurs? After a certain point, prioritise the lower level players when it comes to getting ores from rocks, logs from trees, whatever.</p>
<p>I know it’s hard work though, all said and done.</p>

<p>I don’t think people go on private servers to play for 72 straight hours. Sure skilling is fun but saying that 99 can be achieved in “<span class="bbcode-b">under</span> a few days” is an extreme exaggeration for most of the community.</p>

              <p>Well, the idea behind that would be players would see value in fishing meaning more fish would be introduced. If 10 people get 99 fishing within the first 3 months, the market would be able to support that. But not 10 people are going to get 99, probably around 30-50 would have 60+ fishing at that point meaning lobbys and shark would mellow out.</p>
<p>Economies fix themselves and fudge themselves, as long as you allow it to. When people try to ‘fix’ it, is when it becomes unstable.</p>

At a certain point some items are just strictly not worth producing. For example you aren’t going to keep making iron items past level 30 or whatever smithing, unless you specifically need iron arrows. That’s how RS is designed. But if you get a too high XP rate there may not be enough iron in the economy for people to buy iron to train smithing (if thats how they want to do it), or whatever you want to consider. It’s more complex than that obviously, and it’s not about items becoming obsolete (thats a different issue), it just messes with the supply/demand.</p>
