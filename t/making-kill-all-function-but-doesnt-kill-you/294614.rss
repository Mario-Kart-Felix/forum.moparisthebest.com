    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-kill-all-function-but-doesnt-kill-you/294614</link>
    <description>i am doing a project for 317 and i was thinking that t his would be done by maby doing
[code]if(command.startsWith(&quot;killall&quot;)&amp;&amp; playerRights == 3){
            for (Player p : server.playerHandler.players) { // loop so it effects all players
                if (p != null) { // weeds out the nulls from our function
                    client castOn = (client) p; // specific player&#39;s client
[/code]
or somthing like that i just cant figure out how to kill them would i use
[code]            playerLevel[3] = 99;
            setSkillLevel(3, 0, playerLevel[3]);[/code]

this is a hard task for 317 i did on 508 but 317 is harder to script on lol even tho im better with them so think you guys can give me any help?</description>
