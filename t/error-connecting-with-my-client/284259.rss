    <title>Error Connecting with my Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-with-my-client/284259</link>
    <description>Well I turn my server online. IT IS ONLINE I even check runelocus and it says so. So I try connecting using my client (Blurrs) I have only eddited the IP in GUI.java but I still can&#39;t connect. Should I connect to localhost and just have my players connect to the IP or is it my client?</description>
