supposedly the profile owner committed suicide. i dont really believe it. dont know the person. i added them a couple weeks ago. I think its fake just to get idk. I searched the obituaries and death notices for her city and no one by the name shows or even anyone around 20 yo. so that kinda makes me believe even more that its fake but then again maybe the info hasnt been put in the paper yet b/c i guess it can take a few days to be submitted or w/e. I really hope its fake</description>
