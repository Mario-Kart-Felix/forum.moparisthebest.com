              <p>I find it totally disrespectful that you are calling your server this due to the fact that I know non of your profits will be going to any of the family’s who have had disaster strike their familys. Also its disrespectful to give money earned in this manor to those family’s and troops. Thats like selling crack and giving the money to a vet. So on behalf of me go fuck yourself.</p>
