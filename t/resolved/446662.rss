    <description>Well, I was adding dialogue. It&#39;s for a server I&#39;m planning on making a whole adventure to. But, sadly, it wont work. Can you guys try to fix the error?

[code=java]
case 20:
			sendNpcChat1(&quot;Yu...yu...you are awake my son/daughter? W...We were all worried about you.&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Mother&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 21;
			break;
		case 21:
 			sendPlayerChat1(&quot;Oh mother. How did I end up here?, I feel...lost.&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 22;
			break;
		case 22:
 			sendNpcChat2(&quot;You fell unconscious from the hot weather. During that time, our house was&quot;, &quot;taken away by the king. He told us we had done treason from us buying in eBay.&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Mother&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 23;
			break;
		case 23:
 			sendPlayerChat2(&quot;That is unjust of him! Taking away our house due to&quot;, &quot;silly conclusions! I will go into town and talk to him this instant!&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 24;
			break;
		case 24:
			sendNpcChat2(&quot;Worry not my child, you and your father are just fine here, truly. We&quot;, &quot;have more than enough space here. Please, just help out the townspeople. I&#39;ll transport you there.&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Mother&quot;);
			c.teleAction = 6;
			break;
[/code]

Error:
