    <description>[s]Im working on creating a server, which I have done before, but not for quite a while. I do have experience with this stuff. My question is that if I am hosting my server from one laptop, is it possible to play the server from a different laptop in the same house (so basically same IP address)? If it is possible, do i use the local host login IP (Im using 127.0.0.1 to login on the Hosting Laptop) or the Server IP that was registered on no-ip.com?[/s]

[size=14pt]RESOLVED:
I used the LAN IP of the Hosting Laptop to connect[/size]</description>
