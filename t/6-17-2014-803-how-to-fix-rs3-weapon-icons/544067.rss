[/center]

[center][size=14pt]Lets Starts![/size][/center]

[size=14pt]Step 1:[/size]
You will first need to download the class155.java so you are going want to go to the following link.

[center][size=14pt]Link:[/size] https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,662768.0.html[/center] 

Then you are going to download the file under cache. This is going be your class155.java so make sure to put it on your desktop once you are done downloading it.

[URL=http://s1217.photobucket.com/user/amvoverwizzle/media/RS3%20Tutorial/2_zps13048015.png.html][IMG]http://i1217.photobucket.com/albums/dd390/amvoverwizzle/RS3%20Tutorial/2_zps13048015.png[/img][/URL]

[size=14pt]Step 2:[/size]
Your file should look like this. Now find your server folder and put it next to the class155.java

[URL=http://s1217.photobucket.com/user/amvoverwizzle/media/RS3%20Tutorial/3_zps698f013f.png.html][IMG]http://i1217.photobucket.com/albums/dd390/amvoverwizzle/RS3%20Tutorial/3_zps698f013f.png[/img][/URL]

[size=14pt]Step 3:[/size]
Your server folder should be on your desktop if you watched my tutorial on setting up with Eclipse RS3. Once you have found your server folder you are going to open it.

[URL=http://s1217.photobucket.com/user/amvoverwizzle/media/RS3%20Tutorial/4_zps38cbdea9.png.html][IMG]http://i1217.photobucket.com/albums/dd390/amvoverwizzle/RS3%20Tutorial/4_zps38cbdea9.png[/img][/URL]

[size=14pt]Step 4:[/size]
Once you have opened your server folder you are going to open your Client folder.

[URL=http://s1217.photobucket.com/user/amvoverwizzle/media/RS3%20Tutorial/5_zpsa14e7717.png.html][IMG]http://i1217.photobucket.com/albums/dd390/amvoverwizzle/RS3%20Tutorial/5_zpsa14e7717.png[/img][/URL]

[size=14pt]Step 5:[/size]
Once your in your Client folder you are going to Open src folder

[size=14pt]Step 6:[/size]
Now find were you placed your class155.java witch should be on your desktop if you followed this guide correctly. You are going right click it and copy or press Ctrl + C

[URL=http://s1217.photobucket.com/user/amvoverwizzle/media/RS3%20Tutorial/7_zps1439a59c.png.html][IMG]http://i1217.photobucket.com/albums/dd390/amvoverwizzle/RS3%20Tutorial/7_zps1439a59c.png[/img][/URL]

[size=14pt]Step 7:[/size]
Now you are going to paste the copied file (class155.java) in the scr folder you opened earlier from step 5, you can also paste it in by pressing on the keyboard Ctrl + V 

[URL=http://s1217.photobucket.com/user/amvoverwizzle/media/RS3%20Tutorial/8_zps65cc18bf.png.html][IMG]http://i1217.photobucket.com/albums/dd390/amvoverwizzle/RS3%20Tutorial/8_zps65cc18bf.png[/img][/URL]

Now open eclipse and your finished.

Cody, you have not started a single topic. so as far as your contributions go, F-</p>
<p>Skater and I, i would say are quite similar. I don’t know if he is working on his Bachelors yet or not, but I do know that he knows what he is talking about. There is a difference between being constructive and being a prick, that is a given. Granted he does have to mix the two when arrogance and ignorance jump into the mix(hymmm…). Note the responses this thread has been given. If anyone really stood up for this tutorial, that means they either:</p>
<ol>
<li>don’t know how to copy and paste.</li>
<li>don’t know how to use a search bar.</li>
<li>don’t know what a compiler even is.(i can tell you now, ITS NOT A .bat FILE)</li>
<li>have no damn clue what they are talking about.<br>
If you really have a problem with someone directly, report them?</li>
</ol>

<p>Alright first off, I don’t <span class="bbcode-i">like</span> anyone on these forums. Sk8r is very helpful, so he has earned my respect. If you can do <span class="bbcode-i">anything</span> with RSPS’ please, release one of the two.</p>
<ol>
<li>a hotfix that will fix any deadlock problems.</li>
<li>a 317 that has two fully working inventory systems, including the GUI.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can do one of those two, I will leave these forums. Anyone that is that cocky saying, “I can do anything with RSPS” has absolutely nothing to back it up. You have a few posts, and they’re all bitching and giving false information.</p>
<p>I mean… Take a look at this link:<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,665055.msg4446287.html#msg4446287" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"> http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,665055.msg4446287.html#msg4446287</a></p>
<p>a) You don’t know how to integrate a server into the client, therefor, you don’t know everything about RSPS…<br>
b) You thought that achieving something like this would involve SQL, are you serious…?</p>
<p>Holy shit, do you even know what RSPS’ are made of? Answer that for me, please.</p>

<p>Have you actually looked at any of Sk8rdude’s posts? He’s legitimately the most helpful person on these forums, lol. And this community isn’t <span class="bbcode-i">just</span> for learning and development of RSPS’… If you check it out, there’s many other boards. And I guarantee you can’t, “I can do anything in these revisions and now im working on 803 protocol”. What Sk8r is trying to explain is that he doesn’t want to see these horrible tutorials that don’t do anything. It’s like when you’re at the grocery store and your total is $20, and you have five hundred one dollar bills (because, yahkno, you’re a stripper or something…) and one $20 dollar bill, then you have to sift through those five hundred one dollar bills just to find the twenty.</p>
<p>It’s about usability and efficiency, nothing technology wise goes far without those two. How many people are really going to use this tutorial?</p>
<p>And, "Lol you don’t know what your talking about clearly. Can’t you see the images, the writing I putted into and not just that Your a pro Noob so by all means Piss off ;3"<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Please learn some grammar skills before trying to make an argument</span></p>
<p>And, “lol, just realized your 12 <span class="hashtag">#done</span>”,<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Please learn some grammar skills before trying to make an argument</span></p>
<p>Holy shit, these forums sometimes just make me giggle.</p>

i can say i’ve actually seen lil, help some people respectively but still[/quote]<br>
Lol you should take your own advice you fool.<br>
You’re telling me to say nothing if I’ve got nothing nice to say, yet here you are talking trash about people.<br>
And you must be blind, because I sit around and help people in the server help section plenty. 100% more than Lil_smok3r, and 100000% more than you have.<br>
As for my statement on saying I’m not their parent or guardian. I was saying that, because I’m not, I do <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> have to act like every piece of work you or anyone else submits is a piece of art. That’s what parents are for. They’re there for you to put your feces on a table and they still say “omg you did such a great job, I can’t wait to see more”. No. If I see you put that feces on a table I’m going to smash your face in it, and make sure you know you did bad. That way you know you need to improve for the next piece of work you do.</p>

Dude… Stop making these kinds of tutorials. If people don’t have some sense to get the most current data directly from his source, then it’s their fault. There should be no need for a guide to “teach” them how to download and extract some files.<br>

<p>Seeing as you joined august 10th and are a first time poster you shouldn’t really be talking. All were saying is why the hell do we need a tutorial on how to copy/paste something and this guy didn’t even give proper credits.</p>

              <p>The part where you are lacking is the actual tutorial. Telling people to download, copy and paste is not really a tutorial. It has absolutely no information.<br>
I am not intentionally trying to attack you, but your idea of “helping” needs help.<br>
Do you know anything about RS2/RS3 clients? Why did you post a client fix in the server help section?<br>
This really should be a snippet at most.<br>
Please man, read your own topic. This is a copy and paste broke into 7 steps. If someone does not know how to copy and paste a file, I really don’t think they would be doing much on the web in the first place.</p>
<p>Did you really call me a noob for trying to be truthful?</p>
<p>I was wrong in my previous post. I thought you were downloading someone elses client and just taking the class155. Turns out they already gave you link to the exact file you needed - and you wrote a copy and paste tutorial about it, my apologies.</p>
