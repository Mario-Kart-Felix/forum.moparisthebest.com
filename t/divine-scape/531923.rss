Easy as that! :) our vision is to creat an rsps were people can have a stable eco, friendly staff, and get decent items without having to donate. :) that way donators will not have complete and utter power over normal players! ;) Any Good 317 Loading 608 source is good or even a 508 server would be fine :)

          <blockquote>
              <p>Stable economy: How are you planning on doing that? Almost every single non-pking server says that they have a “stable” economy.</p>
<p>Friendly staff: Well, that’s up to you to choose your staff yourself, so no real comment there, but try to pick people who can handle things better than others.</p>
<p>Decent items without donations: This should be a given. By the way, donations are a bad way of giving away items, or boosts, or anything of the sort. I think instead donations, you could go down a better route, and give small little boosts to people who contribute to the server. Nothing major, maybe like a slightly higher chance with a ring of wealth. Donations should be what they are, donations. Meaning, they give you money to make their game a little better. Sure, you could give them a forum status, or maybe an icon in-game, but you shouldn’t reward donators for donating.</p>
<p>There’s my two cents, and I really am just trying to help you.</p>
