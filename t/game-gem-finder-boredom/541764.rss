    <title>[Game?] Gem Finder [Boredom]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/game-gem-finder-boredom/541764</link>
    <description>I got extremely bored and wanted to make something fun. So I have the base of a &quot;game&quot; called gem finder. Basically, you search for gems in a mine, the server-sided code does tons of math problems, and you&#39;ll find gems and gain experience. The higher experience you have (higher level) the more gems you can find, pretty simple huh? But what&#39;s the point of these gems? Well, you can take them to the store and sell all of your gems for money. 

Yes, this is probably stupid and insanely basic, but tomorrow I&#39;ll probably work on making upgrades, highscores, etc. At least a little more to the game. Here are some images (for those who are genuinely interested).

The mine, I have no gems, what so ever. But I do have some cash and experience.

After clicking &quot;Explore for Gems!&quot; I search the mine and you can see that I&#39;ve found some gems, and gained a little bit of experience.

I searched the mine several more times, just to rack up some gems.

After racking up some gems, I&#39;m off to the shop.

I sell the gems, and now I have no gems, and more money!

Yes, I know this isn&#39;t anything special, not the next breakthrough game or new way to think of life, I just got bored and needed something to do. This could possibly be expanded into a mining base, or into a larger game. As I suggested earlier, I might enhance this to allow for upgrades for better gem finding efficiency, highscores, and more. Stay tuned! I&#39;ll gladly give the source code to anyone who wants it (for whatever reason.)

btw are you using ajax for the mining and updating?<br>

<p>100% PHP and SQL<br>
Reasoning: I for some reason love programming with PHP. And my job recently has been having me do basic HTML and data transformation, and with school/girlfriend I don’t have too much time for “free” or “fun” programming. So while PHP may be redundant, I still love programming in it. And when you can structure efficient code, PHP can be very fast and useful.</p>

Like i said, it’s similar to this. it’s got some cheesy graphics, but yeah.<br>
Here is the starting screen. 99% of the gems look like this.<br>
