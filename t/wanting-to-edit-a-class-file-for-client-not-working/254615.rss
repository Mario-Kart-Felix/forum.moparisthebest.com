    <title>Wanting to edit a .class file for client (not working)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wanting-to-edit-a-class-file-for-client-not-working/254615</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
Im using demonik source atm and was trying to change the name of the actual client itself
I know that some it has to do with mudclient$1.class and version.class, i have gotten version.class 
compiled using javac but i dont see any change in the client itself. Im really confused and dont know where to start.
How do i change the website displayed on the loading screen? how do i change the name of the client window? I have 
been trying for so long but just cant get a grasp on it. Help would be greatly appreciated.</description>

              <p>your trying it backwards, but you can edit it this way using bytecode<br>
try editing the java files for the classes, mudclient.java is mudclient.class, and version.java is version.class<br>
after you edit the java files then compile it, and you should see a change</p>
