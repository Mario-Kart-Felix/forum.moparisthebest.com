    <title>Stable/Great all around server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stable-great-all-around-server/552967</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t been on here in forever so I guess you could say I am a noob. I owned a couple decently popular servers back in the early days (nothing crazy)..

I just want a really stable, good server that I can mess around by myself on. Idk if I want a 317 or 508. I really don&#39;t know the difference too much. I was mainly on moparscape a LONG time ago so I don&#39;t know how things have changed.  

I don&#39;t want something modded to the point that it is super retarded and I would like if there was some of the original runescape world in tact.

What is a great server that I can just download and play offline that has good stable combat, skilling, items like ags/claws/ancients. I want the game atleast up to 2007 date. Other than that I am not too picky I just don&#39;t want something that crashes if you spawn an NpC.

Know of any? Recommendations? Thank you..</description>
