    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-heap-space/536785</link>
    <description>Hello, so I have all the mapdata for a 530 put in to the XenoRune 530 cleaned that was released by [b]southpark[/b]. Anyway, I get into the game, I want to teleport to the tutorial dungeon by ::tele, but it always come up with the Java Heap Space error. Every other place works besides the coords 2522 5000. Do I need to change something within my reading mapdata file or something wrong with the whole area in general. 

It&#39;s a lot to read just for a help but it has all information of the source and everything I&#39;ve changed before the error.

Thanks in advance</description>
