              <p>It was good, nice camera work, only things that let it down are the poor audio quality, particularly when they’re outside, and the quality/resolution of the special effects, including the bits at the end with the splash screens</p>

              <p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:4, topic:543016”]Well… The people acting weren’t exactly the best. The person on the grill didn’t even seem like he was old enough to drink lol. He also seemed pretty unfamiliar with those tongs. He flipped the food so awkwardly lol. The first scene where the guy opens the window and the (what I presume) meteor hits, there wasn’t enough glass in the guy. He was directly in front of the window, and it exploded inwards toward him. And all he suffers is some cuts and 1 small piece of glass in him? Not likely.<br>
The acting was pretty poor (no offence) overall. But the camerawork was pretty great.[/quote]</p>
