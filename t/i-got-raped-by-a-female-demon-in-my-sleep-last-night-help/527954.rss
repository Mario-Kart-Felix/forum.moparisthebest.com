    <title>I got raped by a female demon in my sleep last night, help?</title>

    <description>Hey guys, I appreciate that Moparsape isn&#39;t a medical forum but I&#39;m looking for experience rather than medical expertise largely. I&#39;ve noticed now that I have a long term recurrent issue whereby I will go to sleep with no scratches and wake up with them all over my body (chest, back, arms). I will have no recollection of this happening and no explanation for it, I&#39;ve considered the following: Something else inflicting the scratches upon me, myself inflicting the scratches upon myself and some sort of medical condition or rare circumstance that only occurs once in a while (like dry skin or something).

The breakdown: The scratches are too close together to be done by human nails, I also bite my nails so am unable to replicate the scratches while applying a lot of pressure. That suggests it could of been done by somebody else, or I used an object to perform it in some sort of sleepy, non-conscious action but I&#39;m unable to find any object (my room is very small) that could have been used. As far as somebody else doing it physically, or me leaving the room and having it performed I pretty much barricade myself into my room at night and even without the appropriate obstacles setup it&#39;s hell to get in/out of. 

For me it&#39;s down to rare skin circumstance, medical condition, or of course (in a serious black magic sense) getting raped, or attacked by a female demon which is apparently a legitimate answer on a medical site now. Has anybody experienced this, or known anybody who has reported the same? What do you think it could be, and if this were a every so often environmental skin issue what conditions would cause it?</description>

              <p>This isn’t a recurrent daily thing, like, It’s happened a few times now spread across a few years and I have absolutely no idea what’s causing it. Nothing notable tends to happen after the scratching occurs, they feel like scratches but they heal really quickly to a point where touching them doesn’t hurt at all (Hell, you can’t even feel they were ever there until you find them by looking). I noticed that the people on that site all had burning sensations and pain before/after the scratches, but I can’t/didn’t feel anything to my conscious knowledge.</p>

<p>I don’t think so, I’ve probably seen the worst there is on a lot of topics with this included. I appreciate the disillusioned feeling of watching yourself performing actions you didn’t consciously permit in a drone like way <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Just to reiterate to respond to some responses:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The breakdown: The scratches are too close together to be done by human nails, I also bite my nails so am unable to replicate the scratches while applying a lot of pressure. That suggests it could of been done by somebody else, or I used an object to perform it in some sort of sleepy, non-conscious action but I’m unable to find any object (my room is very small) that could have been used. As far as somebody else doing it physically, or me leaving the room and having it performed I pretty much barricade myself into my room at night and even without the appropriate obstacles setup it’s hell to get in/out of.</p>

</aside>
<p>I feel as if there must be a logical explanation to this that isn’t “You’re being haunted by Freddy Kruger, he’s invisible, undetectable and there is nothing you can do about it aside from subscribing to a religious website and sacrificing goats”.</p>

              <p>I tried googling this but most of it was associated with religion/paranormal shit. One answer on yahoo answers seemed plausible, you said that your bed sheets are think, correct? Perhaps you get too hot overnight and start to scratch your self subconsciously. I used to do this except with another situation - i used to grind my teeth during sleep when I was younger and it just kinda went away. How long have you had these symptoms (i think you told me years ago but forget <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> )</p>
