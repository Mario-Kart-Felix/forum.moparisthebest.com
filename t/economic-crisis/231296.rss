    <title>Economic Crisis</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/economic-crisis/231296</link>
    <description>We are in times of economic crisis.

In August 2007, many banks stopped offering low-rate mortgages, they didn&#39;t want to lend so riskily anymore. They started calling it the &quot;credit crunch&quot;.

Around November 2007, the British bank [b]Northern Rock[/b] was given an emergency load from the Bank of England, it almost collapsed as people rushed to withdraw their savings. After a week or so, the British government ended the run on the bank by saying that savings in every bank would be guaranteed for up to £15000.

An American bank called [b]Bear Stearns[/b] was given an emergency load from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, very similar to the Northern Rock situation, except Bear Stearns only does investments, so there was no run on the bank.

The price of crude oil rose to about $150 per barrel.

The bank [b]Merrill lynch[/b] has been slowly sold off these past few months, its now owned 80% by Chinese people.

A few weeks ago, the mortgage guarantors [b]Fannie Mae[/b] and [b]Freddy Mac[/b] were nationalised by the American government to stop their collapse. Their combined debt is worth around 3 Trillion USD.

A week or so ago, the 3rd largest travel company [b]XL[/b] collapsed, leaving many people stranded in foreign countries, and many more losing their holidays.

And just now, the bank [b]Lehman Brothers[/b] has collapsed.



Loads of stuff costs a bit more, especially food and petrol.
I fully expect every government in the world to change, in times like these, people always blame the government. Like in UK, the prime minister Gordon Brown is getting the shits of it, and the American Republican party seems to not be doing too well either.

Edit from 17/09/08:
News just in, the American government just nationalised another big bank, [b]AIG[/b] has been given $85 billion in return for 80% of the company. AIG controls a large number of pensions and

In Britain, the company [b]HBOS[/b] which controls the [b]Halifax[/b] and the [b]Bank of Scotland[/b] appears to be very close to bankruptcy, it is in talks with [b]Lloyds TSB[/b], it looks like Lloyds will buy it out.
The media is saying its a merger, but its obvious that Lloyds is in control here, its a buy-out, not a merger, if it wasn&#39;t for Lloyds, HBOS would probably collapse.



post here any idea/suggestions/theories/misconceptions you have.</description>

<p>Pay goes up every year. You just don’t notice, like many people do. This is because most people only look at negative news, like price raises. And you don’t notice it because you can buy the same amount of shit like you did last year, while you expect to keep some money left over at the end of the year.</p>

</aside>
<p>the money doesn’t go anywhere, a recession is when growth is negative, so the amount of money you have gets bigger slower (if that makes any sense)</p>
<p>capitalism depends on not just having money, but seeing your money increase,<br>
if the amount of money you have stays the same, thats bad.<br>
if the amount of money you have grows slower then some other guy, thats bad.</p>
<p>R.I.P RSC, its not the banks fault, thats like blaming an animal for eating food you put in front of it.</p>
<p>if a bank doesnt give out risky loans, they will not get as much profit as another bank which does, such banks will decline,<br>
if an animal doesnt eat food, it will not reproduce as much as another animal which does, that animal will decline.</p>
<p>therefore a system like this will tend towards banks which give out risky loans and animals which eat food.<br>
seems studying evolution is quite similar to studying economics.</p>
<p>i blame the system.<br>
perhaps communism isnt the solution for this, but i think we can all agree to be anti-capitalist.</p>

              <p>It had to happen. Banks just kept on lending money to those who couldn’t pay it. It’s quite similar to the '29 crash. People borrowed money so they could invest it. This is not bad, as long as the share prices rise. But they’ll eventually drop, not much, but then everyone wants to sell them because they get scared. Everyone keeps lowering their prices. The same happened with the mortgages. People kept buying houses with loans, because the prices of houses kept rising. But then the prices collapsed, and banks didn’t receive their money.</p>
<p>The government isn’t the one to blame. I think it’s the fault of the banks. They should’ve known that this could happen. The problem will solve it selve. That’s the pro of a capitalistic economy. If something like this would happen in a communistic country, the whole country would be bankrupt.</p>

              <p>We are in times of economic crisis.</p>
<p>In August 2007, many banks stopped offering low-rate mortgages, they didn’t want to lend so riskily anymore. They started calling it the “credit crunch”.</p>
<p>Around November 2007, the British bank <span class="bbcode-b">Northern Rock</span> was given an emergency load from the Bank of England, it almost collapsed as people rushed to withdraw their savings. After a week or so, the British government ended the run on the bank by saying that savings in every bank would be guaranteed for up to £15000.</p>
<p>An American bank called <span class="bbcode-b">Bear Stearns</span> was given an emergency load from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, very similar to the Northern Rock situation, except Bear Stearns only does investments, so there was no run on the bank.</p>
<p>The price of crude oil rose to about $150 per barrel.</p>
<p>The bank <span class="bbcode-b">Merrill lynch</span> has been slowly sold off these past few months, its now owned 80% by Chinese people.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, the mortgage guarantors <span class="bbcode-b">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="bbcode-b">Freddy Mac</span> were nationalised by the American government to stop their collapse. Their combined debt is worth around 3 Trillion USD.</p>
<p>A week or so ago, the 3rd largest travel company <span class="bbcode-b">XL</span> collapsed, leaving many people stranded in foreign countries, and many more losing their holidays.</p>
<p>And just now, the bank <span class="bbcode-b">Lehman Brothers</span> has collapsed.</p>
<p>Loads of stuff costs a bit more, especially food and petrol.<br>
I fully expect every government in the world to change, in times like these, people always blame the government. Like in UK, the prime minister Gordon Brown is getting the shits of it, and the American Republican party seems to not be doing too well either.</p>
<p>Edit from 17/09/08:<br>
News just in, the American government just nationalised another big bank, <span class="bbcode-b">AIG</span> has been given $85 billion in return for 80% of the company. AIG controls a large number of pensions and</p>
<p>In Britain, the company <span class="bbcode-b">HBOS</span> which controls the <span class="bbcode-b">Halifax</span> and the <span class="bbcode-b">Bank of Scotland</span> appears to be very close to bankruptcy, it is in talks with <span class="bbcode-b">Lloyds TSB</span>, it looks like Lloyds will buy it out.<br>
The media is saying its a merger, but its obvious that Lloyds is in control here, its a buy-out, not a merger, if it wasn’t for Lloyds, HBOS would probably collapse.</p>
<p>post here any idea/suggestions/theories/misconceptions you have.</p>
