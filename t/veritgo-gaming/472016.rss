    <description>That Place Called Vertigo, and its everything you wish you did know!

Vertigo Gaming is a community designed for a diverse playerbase that is tired of griefers, asshats, jerks, sexist players, bashers, and overall disrespectful People.

We pride ourselves on knowing we&#39;re working for the playerbase and taking that time to listen to what the community wants, not just what the Owners and Admins desire. We want you to tell us what is missing and what isn&#39;t needed, we will always listen and take into consideration what you say.

We have our preset rules that are brought together from different people to create fairness and equality in game and within the community,

We will not tolerate trolling or general griefing
Sexism
Gaybashing
Judging based on age or voice
Attempting to ruin a game/round through exploits.
Be Mature and respectful, just because you&#39;re over 18 does not put you in a catagory of some dignitary.

If any of these things seem like something you are looking for in a Hangout/Server check us out, no whitelist and both Prem and not Prem members welcomed!
