    <description>[center][font=impact][size=32pt]-- How to Start a 508 Server --[/size]
[size=16pt]By:Davidi2[/size][/center]

[center][b][size=12pt]General Information[/size][/b][/center]
This tutorial is meant to teach you how to get, start, and manage a 508 server. This includes many things:

[ul][li]Getting a source[/li]
[li]Modifying the source[/li]
[li]Choosing an IP[/li]
[li]Allowing others to connect[/li]
[li]Manage your server[/li][/ul]


I would also like to accredit the major contributors to this post:

[ul][li]The_Soul[/li]
[li]BMaw - LinkSys Portforwarding[/li][/ul]

They should be recognized for their help.

Now, let the tutorial commence!

[center][b][size=12pt]Prerequisites[/size][/b][/center]
When starting any server, it is usually found that a certain number of requirements must be met in order to have a professional and functional hosted game.

[ol][li]If hosted on a home computer, at least 1GB [b]R[/b]andom[b]A[/b]ccess[b]M[/b]emory is suggested, but it may depend on how much you use for yourself, and how good the server is. If you want a larger player base, it is also good for the computer to be allowed on 24/7. If you are not hosting on your home computer, it is suggested to have a VPS with 512MB of RAM.[/li]
[li]Most servers and clients are compressed into a single file with WinRAR. If you do not already have it installed, [url=http://rarlab.com/rar/wrar392.exe]here is a download link.[/url][/li][/ol]

[center][b][size=18pt][u]The Tutorial[/u][/size][/b][/center]

[center][b][size=12pt]Step 1 - Getting Started ~ Getting Java[/size][/b][/center]
All 508 private servers are programmed with Java. In order to edit and run your server, you will need to install the latest [b]J[/b]ava [b]D[/b]evelopment [b]K[/b]it. The JDK includes many important things such as the compiler, which is used to change your Java files, into Class files. Class files are the base of your server, or any Java program.


To get the latest JDK, visit this site: [url=http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp]Java Downloads Page[/url] OR [url=http://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/VerifyItem-Start/jdk-6u18-windows-i586.exe?BundledLineItemUUID=z0RIBe.me4UAAAEn7coYlDGB&amp;OrderID=kldIBe.mF4QAAAEn4soYlDGB&amp;ProductID=Vh5IBe.pm2QAAAElRytRSbJV&amp;FileName=/jdk-6u18-windows-i586.exe]use this link to download JDK 6u18 directly[/url]. (I will try to keep the direct link up to date, but please inform me when a new update is released so I can fix the link)
Then, follow these instructions:
[img]http://img130.imageshack.us/img130/9926/installjava.png[/img]
Here is each step in more detail:

[ol][li]Once at the downloads page, click on &#39;Java Download: Java Platform (JDK)&#39;[/li]
[li]After being redirected, select your platform (this tutorial is based on Windows), and optionally your current internet connection to see a Est Download Time. Then click &#39;Download&#39;[/li]
[li]Skip the login step unless you have already registered. Your download should start.[/li][/ol]

If your download does not work automatically, you can click the button &#39;Download Selected with Sun Download Manager&#39; and it should work.

Once you have download Java, you can just install it as you would any other program.

[center][b][size=12pt]Step 2 - Choosing an IP[/size][/b][/center]
Now that you have Java installed, you need to choose an IP that your players will use to connect to your server. In order to do this you need to use a host redirect. In RSPS we usually use [url=http://no-ip.com]No-IP[/url]. A direct registration link can be found here: [url=http://www.no-ip.com/newUser.php]No-IP Registration[/url].
When you register, you will be given a DNS update client link to download. Download and install it. It should be called: No-Ip Duc.
Once you have registered, verified your E-Mail, and [url=http://www.no-ip.com/login/]logged in[/url], you&#39;ll want to follow these steps to get your own redirect IP:
[img]http://img297.imageshack.us/img297/6271/noip.png[/img]
Here is each step in more detail:

[ol][li]Onced logged in, click &#39;Hosts/Redirects at the top.[/li]
[li]When taken to that page, click the orange &#39;Add a Host&#39; button.[/li]
[li]Usually you want a simple one that reflects the name of your server. For example, if your server name was &#39;DarthMaul Scape&#39; you would want an IP like dmscape, or darthscape.[/li]
[li]This is where you choose your extension domain. For example, if you chose the IP name &#39;dmscape&#39;, and the extension &#39;no-ip.org&#39;, the full IP of your server would be &#39;dmscape.no-ip.org&#39;.[/li]
[li]Now this is a crucial step. What you need to do is stop all proxies you may be on, and visit [url=http://whatsmyip.org]this site to view your ip[/url]. At the top of that page it should say: &#39;Your IP is:&#39; and then some numbers. Those numbers should be somewhat like: &#39;12.345.678.910&#39;. Copy those numbers and put them into the &#39;IP Address&#39; box.[/li]
[li]Now click the button &#39;Create Host&#39; to finish this part of the tutorial.[/li][/ol]

Now remember No-Ip Duc you installed when you registered? Now run it, and you might have to log in. A little box should appear with your host name inside. To the left, click the check box to activate your host.

[center][b][size=12pt]Step 3 - Port-forwarding[/size][/b][br][/center]
Port-forwarding is very important if you want to allow other people to connect to your server. However, before doing so, it is very important to give yourself a Static IP Address. If you don&#39;t your internal IP address could change, and then all of your port-forwarding will have been for naught.
A static IP address is one that doesn&#39;t change. Its helpful for port forwarding and a few other things depending on what you do. 

[b]1. Open the Settings[/b]
Ok, in order to set your IP address, you need to go to your settings. To do this do:

[ul][li]Control Pannel -&gt;[/li]
[li]Network Connections -&gt;[/li]
[li]LAN or High-Speed Internet/Local Area Connection[sup]1[/sup] -&gt;[/li]
[li]General Tab, select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) -&gt;[/li]
[li]Click properties -&gt;[/li][/ul]

[sup]1[/sup]- If that is not there then you cannot set a Static IP address.

That should bring up something close to this:
[img]http://davidscape.com/tcp1.PNG[/img] [sup]Sorry for poor quality, I dont want to use to much of my bandwidth[/sup]

[b]2. Finding your Details[/b]
Now go to the command prompt (run -&gt; type &#39;cmd&#39; and hit enter) and type [code]ipconfig /all[/code]

[b]3. Changing your details[/b]
Now do this:
[hr]
[img]http://davidscape.com/tcp2.PNG[/img][hr]

After you click ok you should be all set. Your computer will lose internet for 20 seconds then you will need to restart. 

Now with that done, you need to port-forward your router. Here is a very nice guide by Bmaw for LinkSys routers: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,379865.0.html]Bmaws&#39; guide to LinkSys Portforwarding[/url]
For other routers, I recommend [url=http://portforward.com]portforward.com[/url] for nice tutorials.
If you have questions you can ask them here. 

[center][b][size=12pt]Step 4 - Downloading a Source[/size][/b][br][/center]
I will not sway you to any particular source, but I will tell you that they will all be [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html]here[/url]. Find one that has features you like, and download it. Once you have the .rar file on your desktop, right click on it. If you have installed WinRAR correctly, the option &#39;Extract Here&#39; should be there. Just go through each of the steps by click &#39;Yes&#39; or &#39;Ok&#39; and you should have the source folder on your desktop. If you do not wish to edit your server at all, find the CMD folder, and right click on it and select &#39;edit&#39;. It should look SOMEWHAT like this:
[code]@echo off
cd ../bin
color 0a
Title*****Scape 508
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin\java.exe&quot; SOURCENAME/Server 43594
pause[/code]
OR
[code]@echo off
cd ../bin
color 0a
Title *****Scape 508
java SOURCENAME/Server 43594
pause[/code]
In the first case, change this part: &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin\java.exe&quot;
To your current JDK version. (If you used the direct link, it would be &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_[b]18[/b]\bin\java.exe&quot;)
In the second case, change &quot;java&quot; to &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_JDKVERSION\bin\java.exe&quot; (If you used the direct link, it would be &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_[b]18[/b]\bin\java.exe&quot;)

Now you should be able to double click it and run your server! 

[center][b][size=12pt]Step 5 - Modifying a Source[/size][/b][/center]
When you download a source, there are usually many things you want to do before leaving it open to the public. Some of them are change the server name, and owner name. I shall go through each of these. First off, all of these processes are about the same. To change the server name, you will just use [url=http://uppit.com/v/GYUFUAKV]Z-FileSearcher[/url] to search for the current server name. In all of those places, just change it to the name you want. To change the owner, you need to first do a CTRL+H for the current owner name, and replace it with yours in [b]Login.java[/b]. Secondly, use ZFileSearcher again to find the owner username in the PACKETS folder, and replace all of those with yours. (Usually commands.java has the owner name in it) If there are other things you want help with or think should be added to this section, just post.

[center][b][size=12pt]Step 6 - Compiling and Running a Source[/size][/b][br][/center]
Every time you edit your Java files, you will need to compile and restart your server. To do this, find the CMD folder, and right click on run.bat and select &#39;edit&#39;. It should look SOMEWHAT like this:
[code]@echo off
cd ../bin
color 0a
Title *****Scape 508
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin\java.exe&quot; SOURCENAME/Server 43594
pause[/code]
OR
[code]@echo off
cd ../bin
color 0a
Title *****Scape 508
java SOURCENAME/Server 43594
pause[/code]
In the first case, change this part: &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin\java.exe&quot;
To your current JDK version. (If you used the direct link, it would be &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_[b]18[/b]\bin\java.exe&quot;)
In the second case, change &quot;java&quot; to &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_JDKVERSION\bin\java.exe&quot; (If you used the direct link, it would be &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_[b]18[/b]\bin\java.exe&quot;)

That&#39;s how you run your server. To compile, you follow the same steps, but with
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_1[b]*[/b]\bin\java[b]c[/b].exe&quot;

You can use [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,349078.0.html]this thread[/url] for help with compilers and other batch files.

Now you should be able to double click run.bat and run your server!

[size=16pt]By:Davidi2[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=12pt]General Information[/size]</span>[/center]<br>
This tutorial is meant to teach you how to get, start, and manage a 508 server. This includes many things:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Getting a source[/li]<br>
[li]Modifying the source[/li]<br>
[li]Choosing an IP[/li]<br>
[li]Allowing others to connect[/li]<br>
[li]Manage your server[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>I would also like to accredit the major contributors to this post:</p>
<p>[ul][li]The_Soul[/li]<br>
[li]BMaw - LinkSys Portforwarding[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>They should be recognized for their help.</p>
<p>Now, let the tutorial commence!</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=12pt]Prerequisites[/size]</span>[/center]<br>
When starting any server, it is usually found that a certain number of requirements must be met in order to have a professional and functional hosted game.</p>
<p>[ol][li]If hosted on a home computer, at least 1GB <span class="bbcode-b">R</span>andom<span class="bbcode-b">A</span>ccess<span class="bbcode-b">M</span>emory is suggested, but it may depend on how much you use for yourself, and how good the server is. If you want a larger player base, it is also good for the computer to be allowed on 24/7. If you are not hosting on your home computer, it is suggested to have a VPS with 512MB of RAM.[/li]<br>
[li]Most servers and clients are compressed into a single file with WinRAR. If you do not already have it installed, <a href="http://rarlab.com/rar/wrar392.exe" data-bbcode="true">here is a download link.</a>[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-u">The Tutorial</span>[/size]</span>[/center]</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=12pt]Step 1 - Getting Started ~ Getting Java[/size]</span>[/center]<br>
All 508 private servers are programmed with Java. In order to edit and run your server, you will need to install the latest <span class="bbcode-b">J</span>ava <span class="bbcode-b">D</span>evelopment <span class="bbcode-b">K</span>it. The JDK includes many important things such as the compiler, which is used to change your Java files, into Class files. Class files are the base of your server, or any Java program.</p>
<p>To get the latest JDK, visit this site: <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" data-bbcode="true">Java Downloads Page</a> OR <a href="http://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/VerifyItem-Start/jdk-6u18-windows-i586.exe?BundledLineItemUUID=z0RIBe.me4UAAAEn7coYlDGB&amp;OrderID=kldIBe.mF4QAAAEn4soYlDGB&amp;ProductID=Vh5IBe.pm2QAAAElRytRSbJV&amp;FileName=/jdk-6u18-windows-i586.exe" data-bbcode="true">use this link to download JDK 6u18 directly</a>. (I will try to keep the direct link up to date, but please inform me when a new update is released so I can fix the link)<br>
Then, follow these instructions:<br>
<img src="http://img130.imageshack.us/img130/9926/installjava.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Here is each step in more detail:</p>
<p>[ol][li]Once at the downloads page, click on ‘Java Download: Java Platform (JDK)’[/li]<br>
[li]After being redirected, select your platform (this tutorial is based on Windows), and optionally your current internet connection to see a Est Download Time. Then click ‘Download’[/li]<br>
[li]Skip the login step unless you have already registered. Your download should start.[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>If your download does not work automatically, you can click the button ‘Download Selected with Sun Download Manager’ and it should work.</p>
<p>Once you have download Java, you can just install it as you would any other program.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=12pt]Step 2 - Choosing an IP[/size]</span>[/center]<br>
Now that you have Java installed, you need to choose an IP that your players will use to connect to your server. In order to do this you need to use a host redirect. In RSPS we usually use <a href="http://no-ip.com" data-bbcode="true">No-IP</a>. A direct registration link can be found here: <a href="http://www.no-ip.com/newUser.php" data-bbcode="true">No-IP Registration</a>.<br>
When you register, you will be given a DNS update client link to download. Download and install it. It should be called: No-Ip Duc.<br>
Once you have registered, verified your E-Mail, and <a href="http://www.no-ip.com/login/" data-bbcode="true">logged in</a>, you’ll want to follow these steps to get your own redirect IP:<br>
<img src="http://img297.imageshack.us/img297/6271/noip.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Here is each step in more detail:</p>
<p>[ol][li]Onced logged in, click 'Hosts/Redirects at the top.[/li]<br>
[li]When taken to that page, click the orange ‘Add a Host’ button.[/li]<br>
[li]Usually you want a simple one that reflects the name of your server. For example, if your server name was ‘DarthMaul Scape’ you would want an IP like dmscape, or darthscape.[/li]<br>
[li]This is where you choose your extension domain. For example, if you chose the IP name ‘dmscape’, and the extension ‘<a href="http://no-ip.org">no-ip.org</a>’, the full IP of your server would be ‘<a href="http://dmscape.no-ip.org">dmscape.no-ip.org</a>’.[/li]<br>
[li]Now this is a crucial step. What you need to do is stop all proxies you may be on, and visit <a href="http://whatsmyip.org" data-bbcode="true">this site to view your ip</a>. At the top of that page it should say: ‘Your IP is:’ and then some numbers. Those numbers should be somewhat like: ‘12.345.678.910’. Copy those numbers and put them into the ‘IP Address’ box.[/li]<br>
[li]Now click the button ‘Create Host’ to finish this part of the tutorial.[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>Now remember No-Ip Duc you installed when you registered? Now run it, and you might have to log in. A little box should appear with your host name inside. To the left, click the check box to activate your host.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=12pt]Step 3 - Port-forwarding[/size]</span>[br][/center]<br>
Port-forwarding is very important if you want to allow other people to connect to your server. However, before doing so, it is very important to give yourself a Static IP Address. If you don’t your internal IP address could change, and then all of your port-forwarding will have been for naught.<br>
A static IP address is one that doesn’t change. Its helpful for port forwarding and a few other things depending on what you do.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1. Open the Settings</span><br>
Ok, in order to set your IP address, you need to go to your settings. To do this do:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Control Pannel -&gt;[/li]<br>
[li]Network Connections -&gt;[/li]<br>
[li]LAN or High-Speed Internet/Local Area Connection[sup]1[/sup] -&gt;[/li]<br>
[li]General Tab, select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) -&gt;[/li]<br>
[li]Click properties -&gt;[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[sup]1[/sup]- If that is not there then you cannot set a Static IP address.</p>
<p>That should bring up something close to this:<br>
<img src="http://davidscape.com/tcp1.PNG" alt width="" height=""> [sup]Sorry for poor quality, I dont want to use to much of my bandwidth[/sup]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2. Finding your Details</span><br>
Now go to the command prompt (run -&gt; type ‘cmd’ and hit enter) and type <code>ipconfig /all</code></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">3. Changing your details</span><br>
Now do this:<br>
[hr]<br>
<img src="http://davidscape.com/tcp2.PNG" alt width="" height="">[hr]</p>
<p>After you click ok you should be all set. Your computer will lose internet for 20 seconds then you will need to restart.</p>
<p>Now with that done, you need to port-forward your router. Here is a very nice guide by Bmaw for LinkSys routers: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,379865.0.html" data-bbcode="true">Bmaws’ guide to LinkSys Portforwarding</a><br>

<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=12pt]Step 4 - Downloading a Source[/size]</span>[br][/center]<br>
I will not sway you to any particular source, but I will tell you that they will all be <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html" data-bbcode="true">here</a>. Find one that has features you like, and download it. Once you have the .rar file on your desktop, right click on it. If you have installed WinRAR correctly, the option ‘Extract Here’ should be there. Just go through each of the steps by click ‘Yes’ or ‘Ok’ and you should have the source folder on your desktop. If you do not wish to edit your server at all, find the CMD folder, and right click on it and select ‘edit’. It should look SOMEWHAT like this:</p>
<p><code>@echo off
cd ../bin
color 0a
Title*****Scape 508
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin\java.exe" SOURCENAME/Server 43594
pause</code><br>
OR</p>
<p><code>@echo off
cd ../bin
color 0a
Title *****Scape 508
java SOURCENAME/Server 43594
pause</code><br>
In the first case, change this part: “C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin\java.exe”<br>
To your current JDK version. (If you used the direct link, it would be “C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_<span class="bbcode-b">18</span>\bin\java.exe”)<br>
In the second case, change “java” to “C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_JDKVERSION\bin\java.exe” (If you used the direct link, it would be “C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_<span class="bbcode-b">18</span>\bin\java.exe”)</p>
<p>Now you should be able to double click it and run your server!</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=12pt]Step 5 - Modifying a Source[/size]</span>[/center]<br>
When you download a source, there are usually many things you want to do before leaving it open to the public. Some of them are change the server name, and owner name. I shall go through each of these. First off, all of these processes are about the same. To change the server name, you will just use <a href="http://uppit.com/v/GYUFUAKV" data-bbcode="true">Z-FileSearcher</a> to search for the current server name. In all of those places, just change it to the name you want. To change the owner, you need to first do a CTRL+H for the current owner name, and replace it with yours in <span class="bbcode-b">Login.java</span>. Secondly, use ZFileSearcher again to find the owner username in the PACKETS folder, and replace all of those with yours. (Usually commands.java has the owner name in it) If there are other things you want help with or think should be added to this section, just post.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=12pt]Step 6 - Compiling and Running a Source[/size]</span>[br][/center]<br>
Every time you edit your Java files, you will need to compile and restart your server. To do this, find the CMD folder, and right click on run.bat and select ‘edit’. It should look SOMEWHAT like this:</p>
<p><code>@echo off
cd ../bin
color 0a
Title *****Scape 508
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin\java.exe" SOURCENAME/Server 43594
pause</code><br>
OR</p>
<p><code>@echo off
cd ../bin
color 0a
Title *****Scape 508
java SOURCENAME/Server 43594
pause</code><br>
In the first case, change this part: “C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin\java.exe”<br>
To your current JDK version. (If you used the direct link, it would be “C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_<span class="bbcode-b">18</span>\bin\java.exe”)<br>
In the second case, change “java” to “C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_JDKVERSION\bin\java.exe” (If you used the direct link, it would be “C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_<span class="bbcode-b">18</span>\bin\java.exe”)</p>
<p>That’s how you run your server. To compile, you follow the same steps, but with<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_1<span class="bbcode-b">*</span>\bin\java<span class="bbcode-b">c</span>.exe”</p>
<p>You can use <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,349078.0.html" data-bbcode="true">this thread</a> for help with compilers and other batch files.</p>
<p>Now you should be able to double click run.bat and run your server!<br>
