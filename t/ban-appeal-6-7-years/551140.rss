    <title>Ban Appeal - 6/7 Years</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ban-appeal-6-7-years/551140</link>
    <description>Hello Readers,
My name is Trytohaxme, I was a long time member of Mopar years ago.
I was banned for unknown reasons that I just can&#39;t remember but hope to return.

I believe I joined in 06/07 or early 08?
I had 200+ rep, and was known across the community (I think)

What exactly would have to be done to obtain my old account again?</description>

<p>There was a change in how past bans were handled, we ran queries to change some of the triggers. I’ll speak to the administrator who banned you to see if this instance qualifies for an account unban, though as far as I’m aware the script did remove all the IP triggers associated with your acccount (or should have :P) so I have no issue with you continuing to post on your new account.</p>

<p>I didn’t know we could give access back to accounts from before the change. Thanks for the heads up.</p>

              <p>Quick member search shows that the only Trytohaxme account is trytohaxme v2, which never made any posts. Banned users however shows you had several accounts, back when multiple accounts were against the rules, and were all banned for spamming, flaming, being an ass, and advertising your server via PM.</p>
<p>Nothing we can do.</p>

              <p>I don’t think anybody who was banned six or seven years ago would come back after such a long time. Unless of course they never really left to begin with (i.e., they’ve ban evaded ever since).</p>
