    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-kills-player-1/60115</link>
    <description>ok for my clan system im trying to make it so that when a player in the  zamorak clan kills a player in the saradomin clan, the zamorak team gains 1 point. can someone check to see if this code works. (i cant do mopar on this cpu, the one i can is 2 miles away).

[code]if ((playerIsInZamorakClan =true) &amp;&amp; (playerIsInSaradominClan = true &amp;&amp; playerLevel[3] = 0))
{
zamorakClanPoints += 1;
}[/code]
would that work. i cant test it right now i just want to know that if i set the ints and booleans right, will this code work.</description>

              <p>Well, you mustve made a void for your zammy/sara points. Then, a point system. To make that, use Mod Taharok’s Skill Making tutorial except just add it with the part like this.</p>
