    <description>Hello guys, i was wondering what the code is for making an NPC Talk.

Kinda like making a Player Talk Like force chat.

an Example:  &lt;blockquote&gt;p.chatText = &quot;Example&quot;;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Witch makes a Player talk by Force.

I need help on doing this with a NPC, for when i click on an Object or just on it&#39;s own, an Npc would come out and say somthing. (Alls i need help is with the Npc Fore Chat.)</description>
