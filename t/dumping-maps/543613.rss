    <title>Dumping maps</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dumping-maps/543613</link>
    <description>How would I dump the current maps from the client which can be used for clipping? I have some map data from a different client that had it included but when used for clipping on my server but the map data is inaccurate for certain areas on the map and this is causing following/attacking issues in certain places. I was thinking to just try and remove the parts that are causing this but I think it would be too much trouble.

Where is it handled?</description>

I’m not too into the client area, but wouldn’t it be this, but in reverse?</p>
