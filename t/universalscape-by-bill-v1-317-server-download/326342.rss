[u][b][size=12pt]~UniversalScape~ By RuneFreak10 (Bill) V1[/size][/b][/u][/center]

[center]This version of the game, ~UniversalScape~, has been undergoing construction on and off since October 22nd, 2008. That&#39;s the date the server was originally launched to play. I knew one day I would eventually release it for others, but I wasn&#39;t sure when that day would come. If you&#39;re looking for a source that will maintain a stable economy and stable rules, this is the one for you. Of course, you&#39;ll have to monitor and control that yourself, but if you make the right choices, it should all be smooth sailing.

Now, a small word about leeching. This is what I personally consider leeching; downloading the source, changing the names of everything to your names, only moving things around like objects, areas, npcs, etc., and only editing/adding shops. This server was originally an Allstarscape source. My main goal when I started coding this source was to make it not look like Allstarscape as much as possible. My goal was to add things to my server that were very unique and different from everyone else&#39;s servers and add things no one else had or would think of. I believe I partly succeeded in that, others may disagree. That&#39;s okay though because everyone has their opinion. What I ask from you though is to download this source with the same mind-set I had when I downloaded my first source, Allstarscape. I want your mind set on programming, not editing. I don&#39;t want you to edit this source, I want you to program it, expand it, prosper it, and explore it with what your mind can do and think with programming. I hope with this said you&#39;ll find it easier to see where I, as well as others, are coming from with their feelings on leeching, instead of me just sitting here saying &quot;If you leech my server I&#39;ll hunt you down and kill you and your family!&quot;

I understand that maybe releasing an Allstarscape source that I may be &quot;setting back&quot; the community. Allstarscape source or not, every different kind of server in this community is still a game that you&#39;re supposed to play, have fun with, and enjoy. That&#39;s what this server is about. If you&#39;re looking for a stable, well-programmed framework kind of game, then I would definitely recommend that you do [b]not[/b] download this source. If you&#39;re looking for a source to have A LOT of fun with and just enjoy coding it and having a good time with, then I definitely recommend downloading this source. You also have to keep in mind that I began programming this in October 2008. So if you&#39;re just going to post on this topic saying &quot;Allstar fails.&quot;, or &quot;This server sucks move out of Allstar and get up to date kthxbai.&quot;, then I would prefer that you keep your comments to yourself . I understand where you&#39;re coming from with that. I know that posts like that will most likely occur, and I am preparing for them. That&#39;s exactly the reason why I&#39;m addressing this message to those comments now. To sum it all up, it&#39;s like this; take the message above as a &quot;Stfu and take your ignorance elsewhere.&quot; in advance.

Alright, now as we all know, all servers contain flaws that nobody likes. Even with my game you&#39;ll probably find lots of things you dislike. Here&#39;s some things from the Allstarscape source that were problems that are now fixed in this source.
-----

[b][u]Things I&#39;ve fixed from the old Allstarscape source:[/u][/b]

[ul][li]In Allstarscape, when you would create a new account and log in, you would have 98/14 HP or something similar to that. I fixed this so it would be 10/10 HP.[/li]
[li]In Allstarscape, the attack option would appear when you were anywhere, wildy or not. I fixed this by removing the attack option when you are not in the wilderness and to appear when you are in the wilderness.[/li]
[li]In Allstarscape, the infamous unban command was in there that most servers contained where you would try and unban someone and it would erase the whole unban file. I have fixed the unban command so you may now unban someone in game without erasing your whole unban file. if the name you want to unban appears in there more than once, it will remove all lines equal to the person you want to unban. If that person isn&#39;t banned, it will tell you.[/li]
[li]In Allstarscape, there was a small annoyance where you would need to wield a weapon in order to eat a piece of food. I&#39;ve fixed this so you don&#39;t have to.[/li]
[li]In Allstarscape, some of the skill capes requirements for level 99 were in there, but others weren&#39;t. I&#39;ve fixed this by adding in the rest of them to need requirements, as well as the hoods. This might have been due to the fact that those skills weren&#39;t available to train, but I have fixed that also which will be discussed later on.[/li]
[li]In Allstarscape, when you would attack an npc, it would hit you once then not hit you again. I fixed this so it would keep hitting you back, and I controlled the amount it hits on you.[/li]
[li]In Allstarscape, ::noclip used to auto ban you and ::bank didn&#39;t work for regular players. I fixed it so it doesn&#39;t ban you, but it doesn&#39;t do anything and I fixed banking for everyone, as I felt it would be easier that way.[/li]
[li]In Allstarscape, when you clicked to pick up an item off of the ground, your character would walk over to the item and stand over it, but not pick it up until you clicked on it a second time. I&#39;ve fixed this so you can click on it from a distance and when your character gets to the item, it will pick it up without clicking a second time.[/li]
[li]In Allstarscape, if you have two players, player A and player B, that are in the same area as each other and player A teleports to a spot within that same area as player B, to player A it would update and show that they teleported, but to player B, it wouldn&#39;t update and it would appear to player B that player A never teleported and it would appear that player A was in the previous spot as before. Example: two players teleport to ::teampk. One player takes two steps and teleports back to ::teampk (which will teleport them back two steps). To the other player, it shows that they never teleported, but they really did. I have fixed this so anyone within the range of the player teleporting, it will update to everyone and show they teleported. This was a VERY big main problem in all Allstarscape sources.[/li][/ul]

-----

[b][u]Features:[/u][/b]

[ul][li]100% working unban command[/li]
[li]::mute and ::unmute without problems[/li]
[li]::ipmute to finally stop those pesky spammers that keep coming back.[/li]
[li]VERY better looking chat log. (i.e. Date: 11/07/2009 | Time: 05:37:58 AM | Bill: test chat log test.)[/li]
[li]Better looking ban logs, ipban logs, mute logs, kick logs, jailing logs, AND yell logs. I&#39;ve also logged the ::pass command for security reasons.[/li]
[li]In-game high scores (scored by total level)[/li]
[li]99% sure I&#39;ve fixed all trade duping. Fixed tele grab duping by removing it.[/li]
[li]Fully working crafting (gem cutting)[/li]
[li]Fully working Runecrafting with Abyss[/li]
[li]Working Herblore (identifying herbs)[/li]
[li]Working Woodcutting[/li]
[li]Working Firemaking. Takes a step to the west when you light a log. After a while, the logs go away and ashes appear.[/li]
[li]I have filtered the yell channel as best as possible. When a player swears, it will automatically mute them.[/li]
[li]If you pm while muted, the pm will still send through but if you pm while IP-muted, the pm will not send through.[/li]
[li]Lots of well-organized menus like a rules menu, mod info menu, commands menu, a unique player list.[/li]
[li]I added some commands to the quest tabs, as well as all of the shops.[/li]
[li]Most of the commands are on the emotes tab.[/li]
[li]The max level in a skill for regular players and moderators is 135, while the max level for admins and owners is 1000. (All of the skill capes and hoods require 135 to wear, not 99.)[/li]
[li]CUSTOM MADE BY ME: ::strpk - This divides you up according to your strength levels for more fair pking. While a player with 50 strength would type ::strpk, it would take them to a different place than if a player with level 90 strength typed in ::strpk. Once you arrive to each area, you&#39;re automatically in a safe zone to start. A menu pops up for more information.[/li]
[li]::maxhp which will log you out, give you 999,999,999 HP, then log you back in.[/li]
[li]::money for max cash[/li]
[li]Anti-owner banning/IP-banning/mute - I made an if statement to check for my name and if my name equals who they&#39;re trying to ban/ip ban/mute, then it will deny it. (Go into the ban/mute code and edit my name to your name)[/li]
[li]Mod glow, admin glow, owner glow, barrage glow, flames, lots of different kinds of glows.[/li]
[li]::copy which will copy anyone&#39;s look you put in to copy.[/li]
[li]Working slayer. I removed the stupid chest clicking and added enemy training. After the enemy is dead, you receive slayer xp but you don&#39;t get assigned tasks.[/li]
[li]A way better looking starting outfit. Not that old red robe looking bull crap. You start off with full Saradomin, a rune skimmy, glory amulet, and a little bit more.[/li]
[li]::chill to just chill and hang out.[/li]
[li]::food which spawns 4 manta ray for you (unoted)[/li]
[li]There was ::runes for all players, but I removed that when I added working Runecrafting. Now, you have to craft your own runes to use them. The command is still in there for owners I believe, so if you decide to change that you can.[/li]
[li]::2yell for messages to all (It&#39;s the same thing as the yell channel, only it doesn&#39;t display your name before the message. So you could actually put someone&#39;s name there to make them say something if you wanted to mess with them lol)[/li]
[li]::funpk for safe pking. You obviously don&#39;t lose items and when you go there, the attack option displays as &quot;Attack(Safe)&quot;[/li]
[li]::aa which will say to everyone &quot;Join the forums right now at [forums here]!&quot; (Just switch my forum address to yours)[/li]
[li]::lunar for full Lunar (play on a client that supports it. It all equips correctly.)[/li]
[li]::darkness for a cool custom effect that I created that turns you all dark.[/li]
[li]::away for spawning an npc to say &quot;[name] is AFK! Do not bug him! =D&quot; (Go into the npchandler to switch my name to yours) then ::killafk to get rid of it.[/li]
[li]Custom ::adminzone, ::modzone, ::ownerzone.[/li]
[li]::void for killing npcs that will drop void armour.[/li]
[li]The auto-retaliate buttons are now buttons that turn the emote tab commands on and off. If you click the &#39;on&#39; button, the emote buttons turn into teleporting buttons. If you click the &#39;off&#39; button, all of the teleports on the emote tab turn into the actual real emotes. This is something that Allstarscape sources rarely ever had. Every single emote works perfect accordingly.[/li]
[li]The server source contains two files called DeleteRares.bat and DeleteRares.java. What this program does is when you run the .bat file, it goes through every single character file and deletes all of the items that you specifically choose to delete from their account. It will delete the items that are in their bank, in their inventory, and if they are wearing it. To set which specific items you want deleted, you have to go into the DeleteRares.java file and edit the array that contains them. You&#39;re not supposed to put the noted ids, just the regular item ids. It will still delete all notes of those items though. Also, your server has to be off at the time of this going on. It does not delete the items from those with character rights 2 or higher.[/li]
[li]...And A LOT more which I&#39;ll need to think of and edit this later.[/li][/ul]

There IS a block on all of the syi bots in here. You can&#39;t get mass botted and spammed with the AGF Bot. You can still get nulled, however there is an easy way to fix that. Let&#39;s say for example the person&#39;s IP that&#39;s nulling you is c123-45-678-9.chirn2.vic.optusnet.com.au. Put that whole IP into the IP ban logs, then you have to take that and turn it into 123.45.678.9 and add that into the logs too. It will then read in the server window &quot;Client rejected from [ip]&quot; and the nulls no longer will come in. Sometimes, the IP will be weird where it doesn&#39;t contain numbers. All you have to do is copy that IP then ping it to get back the numbers.

[b]Custom training area where the monsters drop void armor:[/b]
[img]http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/3875/screenshot009r.png[/img]
This may be an issue seeing as void armour were customs that I used through the silab client. If you&#39;re client supports void, change the ids of the drops to your void ids.

[b]Here is the main training area:[/b]

[b]Slayer training area:[/b]
[img]http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/5552/screenshot012w.png[/img]
I didn&#39;t move this area for a reason. It made the most sense having to train slayer in the slayer tower. What never made sense was training slayer in the slayer tower by clicking on the chest like the classic Allstarscape had. Now, to train slayer you have to attack the monsters at slayer tower and you get slayer xp for doing so.

[b]Here is the pking area (TeamPk):[/b]

I never changed this. I mean, come on, everyone loved the classic teampk. ;)

As the menu states, it divides you up by your strength levels to make it a little but more fair. For some odd reason, this was never popular on my server.

Client? There was never a set-client for this source for me. Any client is completely compatible with this server, which is also why I liked it so much. So yeah, you can use your own client for this server source.

Alright, well that&#39;s all of it. The only thing left to do is to download it and see for yourself if it&#39;s worth using or not. You may post positive comments, you may post negative comments, but please stay rational if you post any negative ones. Obviously after putting hours of work into this one post that I won&#39;t be the one coming off as the ass if you decide to post flaming hate comments. If you happen to spot any grammatical errors or mistakes, please point them out to me. Thank you, and happy UniversalScaping.

[b]~UniversalScape~ Server Source Download Link[/b] - http://uppit.com/v/F0QI6IH9

[b]Credits:[/b] Hmm... I think this will be tough. 80% to me, 10% to the original Mod Allstar and the other 10% goes to whoever coded the basic framework of the server. I don&#39;t think Mod Allstar programmed the framework and the game engine, but if he did, then that&#39;s 20% for him. I&#39;m not taking 100% credits like most people, because I didn&#39;t start programming this server by hitting the &#39;new project&#39; button. No one in this community should take 100% for anything, unless they truly deserve it.

All I have to say is that you’re an idiot. Here are my reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>This is a huge gravedig.</li>
<li>How is this a good starter source? This is Allstar (not saying its a bad source, but for starters it is, and there is NO download link!)<br>
[/quote]<br>
Fucking calm down kid. This server is epic and is a GREAT begginers source. Allstar is very easily edited and this allstar stands out so much from the rest. So fuck off if you dont have a nice comment. No one fucking likes you.[/quote]<br>
y u mad tho<br>
And just an fyi, allstarscape is not a good source period; not unless you want your computer to burn itself off trying to handle 20 players (amg i have 20 players w00tasasdfzogrog!£"$!"“£”!)</li>
