    <description>Be sure to read [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,274273.0.html]these[/url] and [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,338737.0.html]this[/url] before continuing.

New times call for new rules. The following first set of rules are now guidelines that are stressed to be followed. We are going to be considerably more lenient toward new tutorials and considerably more strict toward replies. We want to center our attention on encouraging optimism and squashing out any existing pessimism. Be open-minded about everything that goes on in this section, as it is now a day of innovating that which needs dire innovations.

[b]When Posting a New Tutorial[/b]
When you are posting a new tutorial, be sure that it covers all of the following:

[ul][li]It shows some effort put into it -- [i]it&#39;s your work, show some pride![/i][/li]
[li]It&#39;s a tutorial relevant directly to RuneScape 2 Private Servers and nothing else.[/li]
[li]Any code snippets provided have been thoroughly explained with careful detail.[/li]
[li]Make sure that the work you post is only yours, unless you have permission to post someone else&#39;s work and accredit them appropriately. [i]Stealing work is not tolerated here.[/i][/li]
[li]You may post a tutorial that has already been created [i]if and only if[/i] it surpasses any existing tutorials of its type.[/li][/ul]



[b]When Replying to a Tutorial[/b]
When you are replying to a tutorial, bear in mind all of the following:

[ul][li]Accusations regarding theft must be proven. Any arguments created over theft will result in some punishments if they do not have any proof.[/li]
[li]Treat others how you wish to be treated. This must be included in every situation.[/li]
[li]Arrogance and cockiness are no longer welcome here.[/li]
[li]Keep an open mind while reading other tutorials. You may be surprised to learn something new from someone else&#39;s tutorials.[/li]
[li]When posting, be sure to provide constructive criticism in a non-discussion, or by minimum a comment or neutrality. Any negative criticism or flaming will result in punishments.[/li][/ul]



All of the above rules will be enforced at the discretion of a moderator. The first set of rules will be enforced behind-the-scenes using the new filter system. The second set of rules will be enforced on-the-scene using visual warnings. The level of visual warning that is given out depends on the opinion of the moderator.

When you are actually posting a new tutorial, bear in mind that the approval of the tutorial may take several days to complete. If the topic you posted is not spam, you will receive a private message if your topic was denied. The message should include some instructions on how you can improve your tutorial so that it meets our standards. If you receive no private message and your topic was certainly a tutorial that followed all of the rules relevant to it, then it should appear within the Tutorial section at some point.

You may post below if you think any of the above rules can be improved, changed, etc. If you want to suggest new rules or wish to argue the removal of any existing rules, post below. If you request clarification of certain unnamed rules, also post below. Any questions that come to mind regarding any of the above, please post them below. Questions only please, as nothing else is needed.

On a side note: If you want to post any small code snippets or any tutorials you don&#39;t want to explain, post them [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,338418.0.html]here[/url] as snippets in a pastebin. Posting them as actual topics will lead to them being denied.

              <p>This board is ridiculous! There are more MOVED files then there are tutorials. I think that if you move a topic to another board you should not keep another topic which is locked on this board that just has a link. If you think you need to have a redirect then it should stay there no more than 48 hours.</p>
<p>Requests:</p>
<p>Moved redirect topics to be deleted.</p>
<p>All tutorials should get sorted into versions, so 317’s in the childboard of 317’s and 508’s in the 508’s childboard. and same with the 562’s and higher.</p>

I posted a tutorial several hours ago, and have not received a PM nor confirmation that it was accepted. I saw several moderators online a while ago, so I expected it to be looked over. Is there a 24 wait or something else?</p>

<p>I’ve waited now for 3 days, and just saw someone’s tutorial post from 10/9/09, and i posted my tutorial 10/8/09, and haven’t seen it on here, nor received a PM if it was accepted or not.</p>
<p>I’d like an explanation, or something!</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Be sure to read <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,274273.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">these</a> and <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,338737.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> before continuing.</p>
<p>New times call for new rules. The following first set of rules are now guidelines that are stressed to be followed. We are going to be considerably more lenient toward new tutorials and considerably more strict toward replies. We want to center our attention on encouraging optimism and squashing out any existing pessimism. Be open-minded about everything that goes on in this section, as it is now a day of innovating that which needs dire innovations.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">When Posting a New Tutorial</span><br>
When you are posting a new tutorial, be sure that it covers all of the following:</p>
<p>[ul][li]It shows some effort put into it – <span class="bbcode-i">it’s your work, show some pride!</span>[/li]<br>
[li]It’s a tutorial relevant directly to RuneScape 2 Private Servers and nothing else.[/li]<br>
[li]Any code snippets provided have been thoroughly explained with careful detail.[/li]<br>
[li]Make sure that the work you post is only yours, unless you have permission to post someone else’s work and accredit them appropriately. <span class="bbcode-i">Stealing work is not tolerated here.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]You may post a tutorial that has already been created <span class="bbcode-i">if and only if</span> it surpasses any existing tutorials of its type.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">When Replying to a Tutorial</span><br>
When you are replying to a tutorial, bear in mind all of the following:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Accusations regarding theft must be proven. Any arguments created over theft will result in some punishments if they do not have any proof.[/li]<br>
[li]Treat others how you wish to be treated. This must be included in every situation.[/li]<br>
[li]Arrogance and cockiness are no longer welcome here.[/li]<br>
[li]Keep an open mind while reading other tutorials. You may be surprised to learn something new from someone else’s tutorials.[/li]<br>
[li]When posting, be sure to provide constructive criticism in a non-discussion, or by minimum a comment or neutrality. Any negative criticism or flaming will result in punishments.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>All of the above rules will be enforced at the discretion of a moderator. The first set of rules will be enforced behind-the-scenes using the new filter system. The second set of rules will be enforced on-the-scene using visual warnings. The level of visual warning that is given out depends on the opinion of the moderator.</p>
<p>When you are actually posting a new tutorial, bear in mind that the approval of the tutorial may take several days to complete. If the topic you posted is not spam, you will receive a private message if your topic was denied. The message should include some instructions on how you can improve your tutorial so that it meets our standards. If you receive no private message and your topic was certainly a tutorial that followed all of the rules relevant to it, then it should appear within the Tutorial section at some point.</p>
<p>You may post below if you think any of the above rules can be improved, changed, etc. If you want to suggest new rules or wish to argue the removal of any existing rules, post below. If you request clarification of certain unnamed rules, also post below. Any questions that come to mind regarding any of the above, please post them below. Questions only please, as nothing else is needed.</p>
<p>On a side note: If you want to post any small code snippets or any tutorials you don’t want to explain, post them <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,338418.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> as snippets in a pastebin. Posting them as actual topics will lead to them being denied.</p>
