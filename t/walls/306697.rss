    <description>Could sum1 explain me how too do this??

I have a ddsspeced source and i think the edge bank can use a nice b00st!
So sum guy came up with the idea too move the walls (itch are between the bank booths into the bank bulding)
Ive seen this earlier and i love the idea, to make the bank look cooler and usefuller coz you got more space too walk.

But i got a lil problem, i need the knowledge of moving adding and removing ragulair bulding walls too edit this.
Could anyone please explain me how too do this?? or mabey post a link to a thread witch explains it all??
Thanks for reading,
