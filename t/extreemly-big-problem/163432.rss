    <description>[b]Alright[/b], lets not drag this thread out. Basically, I&#39;m trying to get my server online, so that others may come online, and just not me..
I have a [i]SpeedStream 4200[/i] ~ Not sure if its a Modem or Router, but its a black box with cables/wires connected to my computer.
..[b][u]Heres the Catch:[/u][/b]
After, I had gone to my Default Gateway, selected &#39;Setup&#39; - Went to &#39;PortForwarding&#39; and Portforwarded once with TCP, And UDP, Using 43594 as the Port in both boxes, I clicked Apply. - I then went to my firewall, and made two new Exceptions to my Firewall.
[b]Port 1.           Port 2.
TCP.              UDP.
43594.           43594.[/b]
I then, went to [url=http://www.ipchicken.com]http://www.ipchicken.com[/url] ~ And got my IP.
Afterwards, I got a friend to try and log into my server..
He couldn&#39;t connect.. [i]I thought something was wrong with his Client, so I decided to get a different person to try, instead...[/i]

Still, No Luck   

[b][size=20pt][i]X_X;;[/i][/size] [/b]
This problem has dragged on for too long. If anyone can provide some helpful posts, or information as to what would be the problem, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be quite pleased with what I give to you in return.
