    <description> 

       So I was on this 508 and sometimes when I put stuff in my bank everything in my bank would turn X1000. Then theres this boss called Crazay Santa and after I killed him I got Unlimited HP so no one could kill me. There is many bugs on it, I am asking if there&#39;s any possible dupe or a way to get Unlimited HP again. This is only to get payback at someone because they bugged there AGS to hit 90s on my so I can&#39;t kill him anymore!!! He also cleaned me -_- Don&#39;t say I shouldn&#39;t dupe on servers or cheat. I just want an answer. You  can&#39;t drop or trade. Well you can trade but you can&#39;t take your items out. Once you tell me a working dupe I will remove the post so no one will know about it.</description>
