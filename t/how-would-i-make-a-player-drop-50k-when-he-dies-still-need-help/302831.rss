    <description>How would i make players drop like 50k extra cash when they die? I don&#39;t mean like only 50k of the cash they have on them or all their cash... i mean like when they die they will drop 50k cash no matter what they have in their inventory. Lets say... you have full dh and that&#39;s it, when you die you lose full dh and 50k is dropped. How would you do this?</description>
