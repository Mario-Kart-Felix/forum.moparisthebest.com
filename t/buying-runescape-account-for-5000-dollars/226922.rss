    <title>Buying Runescape account for 5000 dollars!</title>

    <description>Buying a runescape Account from 1000 £ to 3000 £ that makes 5000 dollars by paypal !

Since buying money doesnt work anymore i am willing to buy a runescape account lvl 100 + prefered = 1500 £. Depending on your combat lvl and Total lvl my money will go from 1500£ to 3000£ for an account !

+ if you have money on it every 1 M will be bought of a value of 20 £ ea so 100 M =2000 £ extra.

The transfer will be safe as it is on Paypal so you can always get your money back and for my part i shall give you the money BEFORE you give me your informations !

Plz contact me as soon as you can if willing to sell on : tristan_barthel1@hotmail.com.
Thanks.</description>

<p>[quote=“Rog3r, post:1, topic:226932”]This is in the wrong section, but he posted it here so I might as well warn you here.</p>
<p>We went on for a while about talking about it.<br>
Then, he says he want’s to send me the PAYPAL details.</p>
<p>He zips it, and then sent it to me.<br>
It was lucky that I didn’t unzip it, although some of you might have.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">That little asshole tried to hack me, so I took screenshots of the ordeal.<br>
Be aware, he might do it to you.</span></p>
