[B]Blog[/B]

Welcome to Tribunal-PKs first Developer Blog! We decided to make one of these since it would be perfect to give the players an idea on what were doing! We will try to keep doing alot more of these in the future! They are a great way of getting information to players about our future plans.

[B]Updates[/B]

We have big plans for the server this month! We plan on releasing the server to the public for an open Beta!

Some updates before we want to release the server includes fixing all dupes, if not fixed, major bugs, adding vesta,statius,zuriels, morrigans. They won&#39;t be totally 100%, but this is good for us because we can have you, the players test these items out and give us more feedback on how they work.

[B]Content[/B]

-All chaotic weapons except crossbow
-Custom whips, phats, hweens, santas
-Auto vote for points
-Nice donator benefits, more being worked on
-Custom login box
-Instant level
-Flawless PvP
-All spirit shields
-Barrows,whips,furies and more in shops
-Overloads
-100% uptime
-Vps hosted 24/7
-Easy to make money


[B]Beta[/B]

For our Beta testers this month they will be receiving a special Beta only In-Game Symbol! Depending on how many people actually play the Beta. After the Beta we will be resetting all accounts for players who wish to have the Symbol, and those who don&#39;t can keep their accounts. If there is a major bug before the release we will have an economy reset.

Have a nice day!
