    <title>[Release] XML to Java Definitions [Release]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/release-xml-to-java-definitions-release/280413</link>
    <description>Its the moment you have all been waiting for my fellow Moparscapians.

Sick and tired of filtering through thousands and thousands of lines of XML Definitions and code?
Well that time is done.

I have successfully converted almost all XML format Definitions into Java enums and code.

This was all dumped from 202 Mudclient:

http://www.megaupload.com/?d=UMGEC5G1

This will now replace those: Conf&gt;Server&gt;Defs&gt; XML DEFINITIONS
and make it: Conf&gt;Server&gt;Defs&gt; NEW EASY TO USE JAVA DEFENTIONS

Definitions:

[ul][li]DoorDef.Java[/li]
[li]GameObjectDef.Java[/li][/ul]


[ul][li]ItemDef.Java[/li]
[li]NPCDef.Java[/li][/ul]


[ul][li]PrayerDef.java[/li][/ul]


In addition to the 10,000+ Lines of XML being saved by using the Java Definitions, you are also lowering the amount of memory used and you are also saving the time of having to recompress it after every edit.
