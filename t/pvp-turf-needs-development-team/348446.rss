    <title>PvP Turf - Needs Development Team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pvp-turf-needs-development-team/348446</link>
    <description>  Hello. I need about two dedicated server coders, and two client coders, who can code a 474 Refactored Client. I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s called. I&#39;m not a great coder myself, and don&#39;t know much. My buddy, who coded the source from a Shard, is resigning, from conflicts between us and PT&#39;s Future. I want a team who can code happily, and without HUGE conflicts. For the first few weeks, you will NOT have access to the VPS. I am also looking for one GFX Masters, and maybe one Web Designer.

Look, I&#39;m not looking for &quot;professionals&quot; who don&#39;t know anything. I need the team to be good, and know what they are doing.
