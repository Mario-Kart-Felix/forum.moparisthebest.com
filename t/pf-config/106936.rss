    <title>PF Config</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pf-config/106936</link>
    <description>I just downloaded the Port Forwarding Config
It brought up a page with a list of Router Manufactors and Models.

I look at my Router, and I found the manufactor (Scientific Atlanta) but it isn&#39;t on the select list that the PFConfig brings up.

Have I found the wrong name? I looked all around my router, and it looks like thats the manufactor.

So, what do I do if I cant find the name on the PF Config window of my router?</description>
