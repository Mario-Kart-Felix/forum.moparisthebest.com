Now, who was it that said execution punishments are only used when they are 100% certain the guy did it?  :|</description>

Something I can definitely agree with, don't even need to elaborate on the "(or more)" although it might be needed if the stench of hypocrisy in his claim didn't quite waft over some people's noses. I don't think any of us really need to though, do we.  :rolleyes:

<p>I actually agree with you. There is a good chance he was.</p>
<p>However, that’s exactly the point. <em>Chance isn’t good enough.</em> If you’re going to have capital punishment, you have to be DAMN SURE beyond any reasonable doubt that somebody is guilty before executing them.</p>
<p>The wife of the guy who was murdered accidentally summed it up best, she said “he has had 20 years to prove his innocence and hasn’t”.</p>
<p>Yep, guilty until proven innocent.</p>

</aside>
<p>look at the bigger picture, the trial 20 years ago was based primarily on 9 eye witnesses accounts, since then however 7 of the 9 witnesses have changed or removed their testimony and have claimed that the police coerced them</p>
<p>and what evidence was there for the case? no murder weapon was ever recovered and there was no DNA evidence linking davis to the murder, even one of the pieces of evidence(some blood on a pair of davis’ shorts) was reviewed in 2008 by a DNA expert and in 2010 a federal court concluded from the study that the shorts in no way linked davis to the murder and couldn’t even be sure that the substance on the shorts was even blood</p>
<p>here’s a fun fact, sylvester coles was one of the 2 witnesses that didn’t change their testimony, and sylvester coles was never treated as a suspect, after all why should he? I mean, he was at the scene of the crime for a start, he had the same type of pistol used in the shooting and there were testimonies that it was coles who started the fight with the homeless person and even pistol whipped the homeless person as he walked away which eventually lead to the police officer, who was shot, to intervene, that’s no reason to treat someone as a suspect right? in all seriousness though the police never checked on coles despite coles having a .38, the same weapon as the murder weapon which was never found, and in one of the appeal courts 9 people who did not originally testify sworn that coles was the shooter and the judge dismissed it</p>
<p>another fun fact is, when the original 9 eye witnesses who were asked to re-enact the crime a week after the murder, coles was one of them and was treated as an innocent bystander while davis picture was all over the news and was in jail at the time</p>

<p>of course he placed multiple appeals, he was on death row and maintained his innocence until he died, people tend to appeal their crime when they claim their innocence</p>

</aside>
<p>interesting fact, the supreme court took unusually long to come to a decision, 4 hours for the 11th hour decision, and haven’t commented on why they took this long, it’s nothing substantial just interesting</p>
<p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:25, topic:415528”]<a class="mention" href="/u/some">@some</a> points the article made</p>
<ol>
<li>No conclusive DNA evidence?  This was 1989 people, DNA tests weren’t (widely?) used at all.[/quote]</li>
</ol>
<p>that doesn’t mean shit, DNA lasts a LONG time and examination of DNA evidence from OLDDDDD 30-40 year old crimes has changed the outcome of other cases, people are often proven innocent based on recent examination of old DNA evidence and a lot of old unsolved crimes have been solved due to recent DNA examination, and evidence from crimes is USUALLY locked up for years in a police warehouse, there is no issue of re-examining old evidence at all</p>
<p>and my understanding of this case is no DNA evidence found ever linked davis to the crime and recent studies from 2008 confirm this</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>hate to bring up coles again but both coles and davis had a .38 which was the type of gun used in the murder, and the murder weapon was never found, the police never investigated coles .38 and the ballistics evidence was just the shells and bullets at the crime scene from what I remember</p>
<p>I’ve casually followed this case for a few weeks and I don’t really know if davis was guilty or not, but what I’ve learned is that the original investigation was rushed and poorly conducted and new testimonies and re-examination of old evidence was never taken into account in the appeals, it’s extremely shocking that without any concrete evidence, substantial doubt and only 2 testimonies can get someone executed in america despite many americans claiming people are only ever executed when there is no doubt that they are guilty</p>
<p>and now for some not-so comic relief, I give you an image I found on reddit(that was probably found on 4chan) - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/W2F4S.png" rel="nofollow noopener">http://i.imgur.com/W2F4S.png</a></p>

<p>Guys, we need to align our opinions together because we’re not all saying the same thing, even if we share some of the same opinions.</p>

              <p>I read the article, and since I (or any of you, probably) don’t know any details of the case beyond that, he probably was guilty.  Look at the facts here, 20 years ago, a jury of his peers (12 un-related people), after seeing all the evidence from both sides had absolutely no shread of doubt that he was guilty (otherwise they couldn’t have put in a guilty verdict).  Since then he has put in multiple appeals to about anyone and any court that he could, and they have all been denied based on the evidence.  His most recent one was all the way to the supreme court, who saw no reason why the verdict should have been overturned.  This man had to be either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Guilty.</li>
<li>The unluckiest bastard on the entire face of the earth.</li>
</ol>
<p>But my bet is on guilty.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/some">@some</a> points the article made</p>
<ol>
<li>No conclusive DNA evidence?  This was 1989 people, DNA tests weren’t (widely?) used at all.</li>
<li>There was ballistic evidence, the defense said it was flawed, but obviously a jury of 12 and countless judges disagreed.</li>
<li>The ‘Council of Europe’ recommended he not be executed?  Mind your own fucking business.</li>
<li>The Pope was on his side?  More like the Pope is against capital punishment PERIOD.  He also would have been against the killing of the racist bastard that happened in Texas that day as well.</li>

</aside>
<p>There is many nice solutions very small crimes that don’t include prison. Like community service and electronic shackles. But you shouldn’t use that against murder of course.  Prison sentence doesn’t work alone, but getting help inside prison and when they get out is the solution. The government should secure a home and a job for the inmate at the release. That could prevent them from doing stupid things again. Too bad “the great capitalist United States” aren’t able to create enough workplaces.</p>

I agree with Bowser jr, the death penalty might seem like a great way to get rid of criminals, but it’s final. Besides, a life penalty isn’t that more expensive, and it’s definitely more humane.<br>

You know a solution that is less expensive and more humane?<br>
Limited prison sentence, and bringing the prisoners back into the society with rehabilitation.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not saying we should put criminals away for life. But it’s better than executing them. There is a tiny group of criminals who can’t stop committing crimes, and agree that they are, and always will be, a danger to society. This specific group should be put in a special institution, where they can live a decent life while being locked up. So an internally open institution that’s closed from the outside world.</p>
<p>The rest of the criminals need help, a prison sentence won’t do that much.</p>
