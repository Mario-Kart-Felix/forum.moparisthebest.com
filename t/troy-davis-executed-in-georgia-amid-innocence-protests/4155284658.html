        <p>I read the article, and since I (or any of you, probably) don’t know any details of the case beyond that, he probably was guilty.  Look at the facts here, 20 years ago, a jury of his peers (12 un-related people), after seeing all the evidence from both sides had absolutely no shread of doubt that he was guilty (otherwise they couldn’t have put in a guilty verdict).  Since then he has put in multiple appeals to about anyone and any court that he could, and they have all been denied based on the evidence.  His most recent one was all the way to the supreme court, who saw no reason why the verdict should have been overturned.  This man had to be either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Guilty.</li>
<li>The unluckiest bastard on the entire face of the earth.</li>
</ol>
<p>But my bet is on guilty.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/some.html">@some</a> points the article made</p>
<ol>
<li>No conclusive DNA evidence?  This was 1989 people, DNA tests weren’t (widely?) used at all.</li>
<li>There was ballistic evidence, the defense said it was flawed, but obviously a jury of 12 and countless judges disagreed.</li>
<li>The ‘Council of Europe’ recommended he not be executed?  Mind your own fucking business.</li>
<li>The Pope was on his side?  More like the Pope is against capital punishment PERIOD.  He also would have been against the killing of the racist bastard that happened in Texas that day as well.</li>

<p>Look at the facts here, 20 years ago, a jury of his peers (12 un-related people), after seeing all the evidence from both sides had absolutely no shread of doubt that he was guilty (otherwise they couldn’t have put in a guilty verdict).</p>

</aside>
<p>look at the bigger picture, the trial 20 years ago was based primarily on 9 eye witnesses accounts, since then however 7 of the 9 witnesses have changed or removed their testimony and have claimed that the police coerced them</p>
<p>and what evidence was there for the case? no murder weapon was ever recovered and there was no DNA evidence linking davis to the murder, even one of the pieces of evidence(some blood on a pair of davis’ shorts) was reviewed in 2008 by a DNA expert and in 2010 a federal court concluded from the study that the shorts in no way linked davis to the murder and couldn’t even be sure that the substance on the shorts was even blood</p>
<p>here’s a fun fact, sylvester coles was one of the 2 witnesses that didn’t change their testimony, and sylvester coles was never treated as a suspect, after all why should he? I mean, he was at the scene of the crime for a start, he had the same type of pistol used in the shooting and there were testimonies that it was coles who started the fight with the homeless person and even pistol whipped the homeless person as he walked away which eventually lead to the police officer, who was shot, to intervene, that’s no reason to treat someone as a suspect right? in all seriousness though the police never checked on coles despite coles having a .38, the same weapon as the murder weapon which was never found, and in one of the appeal courts 9 people who did not originally testify sworn that coles was the shooter and the judge dismissed it</p>
<p>another fun fact is, when the original 9 eye witnesses who were asked to re-enact the crime a week after the murder, coles was one of them and was treated as an innocent bystander while davis picture was all over the news and was in jail at the time</p>

<p>interesting fact, the supreme court took unusually long to come to a decision, 4 hours for the 11th hour decision, and haven’t commented on why they took this long, it’s nothing substantial just interesting</p>

</ol>
<p>that doesn’t mean shit, DNA lasts a LONG time and examination of DNA evidence from OLDDDDD 30-40 year old crimes has changed the outcome of other cases, people are often proven innocent based on recent examination of old DNA evidence and a lot of old unsolved crimes have been solved due to recent DNA examination, and evidence from crimes is USUALLY locked up for years in a police warehouse, there is no issue of re-examining old evidence at all</p>
<p>and my understanding of this case is no DNA evidence found ever linked davis to the crime and recent studies from 2008 confirm this</p>

</aside>
<p>hate to bring up coles again but both coles and davis had a .38 which was the type of gun used in the murder, and the murder weapon was never found, the police never investigated coles .38 and the ballistics evidence was just the shells and bullets at the crime scene from what I remember</p>
<p>I’ve casually followed this case for a few weeks and I don’t really know if davis was guilty or not, but what I’ve learned is that the original investigation was rushed and poorly conducted and new testimonies and re-examination of old evidence was never taken into account in the appeals, it’s extremely shocking that without any concrete evidence, substantial doubt and only 2 testimonies can get someone executed in america despite many americans claiming people are only ever executed when there is no doubt that they are guilty</p>

<p>I actually agree with you. There is a good chance he was.</p>
<p>However, that’s exactly the point. <em>Chance isn’t good enough.</em> If you’re going to have capital punishment, you have to be DAMN SURE beyond any reasonable doubt that somebody is guilty before executing them.</p>
<p>The wife of the guy who was murdered accidentally summed it up best, she said “he has had 20 years to prove his innocence and hasn’t”.</p>
<p>Yep, guilty until proven innocent.</p>

<p>Hello logical fallacies!</p>
<p>Niall dealt with those quite effectively.</p>
<blockquote>Because the United States never makes suggestions (or more) about how other countries should be treating their citizens, right?</blockquote>
Something I can definitely agree with, don't even need to elaborate on the "(or more)" although it might be needed if the stench of hypocrisy in his claim didn't quite waft over some people's noses. I don't think any of us really need to though, do we.  :rolleyes:
<p>I’ve always wondered, I see capital punishment as no real punishment (since they just die, it’s actually more punishing to the families!) do people who think capital punishment is effective believe those that are killed go to suffer in hell? Is that why people are behind it?</p>
