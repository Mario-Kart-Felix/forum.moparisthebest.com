    <description>Hey there, i need help with making about 4 commands and adding a &quot;Full report system&quot; to MEGAscape&#39;s source code.

If you could help me, please email enumeric [at] aol.com or add it to msn

The commands i would like creating are:
::give #### # # (same as pickup command but gives item to another player)
::onduty (increases admin level 3&#39;s strength, defence and possibly speed?)
::offduty (puts admin level 3&#39;s stuff back to normal)
::teleother #### # # (Teleport another person to set co-ordinates)

I hope you can help, thankyou.

              <p>Those are some pretty basic commands. The “Full Report System” Is found under <span class="bbcode-b">“Help With your Server”</span> (I think thats what it is called. Use your <span class="bbcode-b">“Search”</span> button or use <span class="bbcode-b">“Google”</span> and type in </p><blockquote>“How to add commands to a moparscape server.”</blockquote> I hope this helps!
