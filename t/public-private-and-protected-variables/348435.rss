    <description>Introduction
I have experimented with many server&#39;s now. I have noticed a lot of people use process timers with Integers which is not the best way to do it. But thats not why I am posting this. I noticed that all of the process timer&#39;s using Integer&#39;s where public variables.

Just about every variable in the client.java class was public. This is not required. If I used a variable for a process timer I would make it private.

Let me explain to many of you newbies what a Public, Private and Protection variables are.

Public Variables

A Public variable is a variable which can be accessed from any file. For example if somebody made a random file named Hax.java and put the code below in it. It would print out the variable.

[code]public class Hax {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println(client.MYVARIABLE);
    }
}[/code]

If client.class contained a public variable named what was declared in the Hax class it would print it out.

Declaration Example

[code]public int JellyBeans = 500;[/code]

Private Variables

A Private variable is probably the best type of variable you would want if you can use it in your situation.

When using a private variable the only file which can access it is the index of the variable. Say you have private int LOLOWNED = 25; in client.class and someone tried to print it out using the code below. It wouldn&#39;t compile, it would return an error saying that, that variable is private and cannot be accessed from a world class.

[code]public class Hax {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println(client.LOLOWNED);
    }
}[/code]

Declaration Example

[code]private int CurrentTime = 1050;[/code]

Protected Variables

A Protected variable can be accessed From a packaged class, sub-class or the main class. If the code above was used it would reject it because its not in the main class, sub-class and it isn&#39;t packaged.

Double Variables (Integers only)
Well a double variable is an integer which can take decimals. Have you ever tried compiling private int Myvariable = 1.203; and you get errors? Well that&#39;s what doubles are for.

A double variable can hold values like 1.22222.

Declaration Example

[code]private double Version = 1.2;[/code]

Note: Doubles can&#39;t hold values such as 2.2.2; A Double variable can only hold a number with one decimal. If you are looking for making a version with 1.2.2 you will have to use a string.

Final Variables
A final variable as you might have noticed in a Constants file in a server is a variable which can not be changed. You can&#39;t edit final variable

Declaration Example

[code]private final int CurrentTime = 1050;[/code]

Other types

Other types of variables can only be accessed from the main class or a package.
