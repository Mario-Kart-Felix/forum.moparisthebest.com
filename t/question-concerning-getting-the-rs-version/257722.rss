    <title>Question concerning getting the rs version</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-concerning-getting-the-rs-version/257722</link>
    <description>Hi everyone, I&#39;ve been around just searching and gathering knowledge left and right and i told myself it was time to start putting that knowledge to use.  So i wanted to know something about getting the SIPUSH values from the main method in the client.  With all the values returned in and added into an ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; using (SIPUSH)instruction.getValue().intValue() i remove the known values as the 765 &amp; the 503 for the width and height respectively.  Now i also remove &lt;= 500 because no use keeping the junk values since the current is 528.  When i remove them though it still keeps 2 values of -27635 and the client version.
[code]
for (int a=0; a&lt; possibleVersions.size(); a++) {
	if (possibleVersions.get(a) &lt;= 500 || possibleVersions.get(a) &gt;= 600 || 
			possibleVersions.get(a) == 765 || possibleVersions.get(a) == 503) {
				possibleVersions.remove(a);
	}
}
		
for (int b=0; b &lt; possibleVersions.size(); b++) {
	System.out.println(&quot;Possible Values: &quot;+possibleVersions.get(b));
}
[/code]
The following produces

Possible Values: -27635
Possible Values: -27635
Possible Values: 528

weird huh?  I can&#39;t figure out why those negative values are there... because if i do if (!(possibleVersions.get(b) &lt;= 500) println..... it only prints the version but I want to figure out why those negative values arent being taken out with the previous if statement containing the 4 conditions.

As for the whole code I used this topic http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,11564.0.html so i do not take credits, I just think that was the right place to start.

[code]
try {
			JavaClass myClass = Repository.lookupClass(className); //Represents className as a Java Class
			ClassGen myClassGen = new ClassGen(myClass); //Template class for building/editing a Java Class
			Method[] methods = myClassGen.getMethods(); //Gets the methods from the class
			for (Method m: methods) {
				if (m.getName().equals(&quot;main&quot;)) {
					//Template class for building/editing a method inside the class
					MethodGen methodGen = new MethodGen(m, &quot;main&quot;, new ConstantPoolGen(myClass.getConstantPool()));
					//Template class acting as a container for a list of Instruction objects
					InstructionList iList = methodGen.getInstructionList();
					//Abstract super class for all Java byte codes.
					Instruction[] instructions = iList.getInstructions();
					for (Instruction i: instructions) {
						//SIPUSH -&gt; Bytecode of short being pushed on stack
						if (i instanceof SIPUSH) {
							//Adding the int value of the short value to the arraylist of possible version values
							possibleVersions.add(((SIPUSH)i).getValue().intValue());
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
		catch(ClassNotFoundException cnfe) {
			System.out.println(&quot;Client class wasn&#39;t found.&quot;);
			cnfe.printStackTrace();
		}
[/code]
The comments I added are just so I know what i can refer to if I have trouble.

If anyone can tell me why I get those two negative ints I would be grateful because return possibleVersions.get(possibleVersions.size()-1); doesn&#39;t seem like a good solution as that can probably break very easily. Thank You.</description>

I was starting from his example. He eliminates values below 600 and then checks if 768 occurs.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t use this method at all, but instead retrieve the build number when it’s send to the server (same as cartidges said before).<br>
I posted an in depth tutorial on this back on rs-resources, but since it’s closed I can’t refer to it anymore.</p>
<p>To catridges:<br>
I don’t know to who you referred on the last part of your post (about updating). In my case I meant the client can’t be updated without changing the build number.<br>
Since the server checks it’s build number and then tells it can continue (or can’t).<br>
However, it’s said that md5 checksums do change, but that would be such a small change that it isn’t required to update the client for.<br>
Server/cache updating has nothing to do with this.</p>

</aside>
<p>Like i said, I was at a complete loss for your mentioning of the graphics library with a native res of 1024x768.  Graphics and coding for me have never been a strong point and you must forgive me if it sounded like I had any expertise in such an area.  TBH the only graphical programming I’ve ever done with java is with the standard awt and swing components.  I have never worked with external graphic libraries such as the ones you mentioned.  Although I can thank you for the information I have yet to understand how to implement it with this current project, but I will look into it.</p>
<p>As far as “only understand[ing] BASIC concepts and are rather unwilling and unable to grasp anything beyond that” one has to have a firm BASIC understanding of the basics to move on into unknown territory and gain more knowledge of the more advanced topics.  To say that I am unwilling and unable to grasp anything beyond basics would just mean that you are close minded since you can’t possibly understand what my values are to increase my particular knowledge of a particular topic.  In other words, I’d rather perfect my skills of programming a certain application and finding ways of making it better, before moving on to the more advanced stuff which I might not know as much as you seem to have pointed out.  All in all I am sorry I didn’t match up to your expectations, but everyone has to start somewhere if they desire increasing the gray matter held in the brain.</p>

Seconded.</p>
<p>And you completely missed the concept deadly72… I think you have no idea what you’re even talking about. The GL versions native res is 1024x768… GL stands for graphics library, it’s got NOTHING to do with regular runescape, this is a port of runescape that uses OpenGL libs such as LWJGL and JOGL. (Technically a combination of the two…) Anyway, look into it. Why not port graphical rendering off to another device and free up the CPU for less demanding computations then that of texel production?</p>
<p>TBH I was mislead, you seem to only understand BASIC concepts and are rather unwilling and unable to grasp anything beyond that.</p>
<p>ON ANOTHER NOTE! You can too update runescape without changing the build. THE CLIENT is an engine, you can update the cache, or the server and update the way the game functions. You don’t have to add stuff to the engine in order to add content.</p>
<p>You too, are a square.</p>

After running a few tests about the information on creating a new arraylist and storing the good values in it, it became clear using the system.nanotime() function that it was indeed faster then just removing the value at index(int pos).  Why this is the case? I have no idea yet but I’m going to look further into it as to me that is strange.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Removing a value would be the same speed as adding a value. BUT you are removing multiple values and only adding one lol.<br>
Although I’m wondering why you just wouldn’t do this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">for (int a = possibleVersions.size() -  1; a &gt;= 0; a--) { //call size() only once, because it takes quite a lot of instructions
        int value = possibleVersions.get(a); //again, call it only once to save speed
	if (value &gt; 503 &amp;&amp; value &lt; 600) { //768 &gt;= 600 lol
		return value; //I think you want to return it right
	}
}</code></pre>

And now the speed freak analysis: remove the a++ from the loop and put it in an else block. A faster way that reduce the number of arraycopys would be to use a new ArrayList as suggested.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t understand why removing the a++ from the loop and putting it in the else block would increase the speed.  Can you please shed some light on this?  As far as using a new arraylist to store the returned “good” values wouldn’t this slow down and demanding more processing power from the jvm? like a c++ program for example, where allocating new variables without garbage collecting the old ones would just be a waste of memory?  I would love to make things more efficient, but somehow I fail to see how initializing a new variable and not just modifying the old one to store the good data inside it would make the process faster?[/quote]<br>
If you use the else method you dont have an a++; then a–;. You just have one a++;. Of course the jvm could do some fancy conditional optimization but thats system dependent.</p>
<p>Using ArrayList.remove on any element other than the last element results in the following elements to be copied one index forward. A new ArrayList would result in an additional performance hit with the allocation of the instance but after than it would be much faster.</p>

<p>Yes i know he meant that, what i wanted to say about this, is the fact that he mentioned it increases the speed, and I would like to know why it would do such a thing if the condition for the for loop is already set with a determined size?  What i mean is why is it faster for the jvm to execute the code you mentioned over &gt; for (int a=0; a &lt; possibleVersions.size(): <span class="bbcode-b">a++</span> ) ?</p>
<p>As for my previous concern of initializing a new arraylist to store the good values I’d still like to get a response for that if possible.</p>

              <p>[quote=“deadly72, post:3, topic:257722”]I see. Funny thing I didnt even know about this and I’ve been working with ArrayLists for such a long time since they are way easier to manipulate then standard arrays.  When you say [quote author=Moparisthebest link=topic=340234.msg2637467#msg2637467 date=1232602303]not modify the original ArrayList, and just push the values that are possible onto a new one.<br>
[/quote] do you mean crate a new arraylist, add the values leftover after processing them through the conditions, and reprocess them through the same conditions over again?  Meaning that would essentially take out the remaining negative values?  As for the information about the arraylist, thank you very much once again.</p>
<p>A quick thought came to me about what you said.  I think the following could fix it, and I’ll have to give it a try.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">for (int a=0; a&lt; possibleVersions.size(); a++) {
	if (possibleVersions.get(a) &lt;= 500 || possibleVersions.get(a) &gt;= 600 || 
			possibleVersions.get(a) == 765 || possibleVersions.get(a) == 503) {
				possibleVersions.remove(a);
                                [b]a -= 1;[/b]
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>bolded out what i think could fix this.[/quote]</p>
<p>What I mean is put the good values in another ArrayList, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; possibleGoodVersions = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
for (int a=0; a&lt; possibleVersions.size(); a++) {
	if (possibleVersions.get(a) &gt; 500 &amp;&amp; possibleVersions.get(a) &lt; 600 &amp;&amp; 
			possibleVersions.get(a) != 765 &amp;&amp; possibleVersions.get(a) != 503) {
				possibleGoodVersions.add(a);
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>Your code fix is a good idea, but remove could remove more than one index if the value is a duplicate, so it won’t work all the time either.  My code should work for you.</p>

              <p>[quote=“cartridges, post:4, topic:257722”]A trace would be the most SECURE means. Version appears elsewhere too. Find Packet.p1() method and js5connect()… look for a p1, and trace the number, that’s the version… That’s pulling the version from the “JS5_IDENTIFY” packet. You can also pull it from the login packet too.</p>
<p>Don’t be a square![/quote]</p>
<p>Would you be perhaps telling me that this way of finding the client “build” number is obsolete?  Maybe suggesting me somewhat along the lines of <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,334712.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,334712.0.html</a> this topic?  I understand that this concept seems much more stable as you can only get one answer that being the build number.</p>
<p>As for the current way in which the number is being found I thank you for the spawn size although i thought the native res was 765x503?  I must admit I am almost at a complete loss here.  I just want to figure out the multiple ways of getting this build number, possibly perfecting them, then move on to other things such as hooking.</p>

<p>moparisthebest has that script which downloads new client versions, he uses md5sum and finding the version<br>
sometimes you get new clients which have a different md5sums, but the same version</p>
<p>perhaps they changed something little which doesnt need anything else to be changed. i dont know, just speculation[/quote]<br>
Concerning some updates which keep the same rs version/build number (however you may prefer to say it) I believe that implementing a checksum would be an efficient way of checking if it is the same release or not.  If it isn’t, it shouldn’t matter because the hooks would just spit out the new info?  Thank you all for the useful input.</p>

sometimes runescape releases a new client with the same version as the last so it cant be build number.<br>

Doubtful, since it wouldn’t be able to update itself.[/quote]</p>
<p>moparisthebest has that script which downloads new client versions, he uses md5sum and finding the version<br>
sometimes you get new clients which have a different md5sums, but the same version</p>
<p>perhaps they changed something little which doesnt need anything else to be changed. i dont know, just speculation</p>

<p>Client tells server it’s build number. Server answers OK or a random int.<br>
If OK continue, else tell the client is outdated.</p>

<span class="bbcode-b">THE NEGATIVE VALUES ARE GIFTS FROM THE OBFUSCATER!</span></p>
<p>Their intention is to throw off static pattern analysis by throwing in statics of their own that could match a static “hook” position dependant on constants within the client… They’re like the flow obfuscation, they don’t particularly effect the game in runtime, but they make static analysis and returning to an unobfuscated source that much more difficult.</p>
<p>So! Thinking about it, it’s not “VERSION” I don’t know who coined that… It’s a build number, build numbers are greater than or equal to 1? I mean, the first build is going to be 1, obviously. Add that to your conditional. It’s also important to know the GL applets spawn size is 1024/768… so elimate those values too.</p>
<p>A trace would be the most SECURE means. Version appears elsewhere too. Find Packet.p1() method and js5connect()… look for a p1, and trace the number, that’s the version… That’s pulling the version from the “JS5_IDENTIFY” packet. You can also pull it from the login packet too.</p>
<p>Don’t be a square!</p>

              <p>I see. Funny thing I didnt even know about this and I’ve been working with ArrayLists for such a long time since they are way easier to manipulate then standard arrays.  When you say [quote=“Moparisthebest, post:2, topic:257722”]not modify the original ArrayList, and just push the values that are possible onto a new one.[/quote] do you mean crate a new arraylist, add the values leftover after processing them through the conditions, and reprocess them through the same conditions over again?  Meaning that would essentially take out the remaining negative values?  As for the information about the arraylist, thank you very much once again.</p>
<p>A quick thought came to me about what you said.  I think the following could fix it, and I’ll have to give it a try.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">for (int a=0; a&lt; possibleVersions.size(); a++) {
	if (possibleVersions.get(a) &lt;= 500 || possibleVersions.get(a) &gt;= 600 || 
			possibleVersions.get(a) == 765 || possibleVersions.get(a) == 503) {
				possibleVersions.remove(a);
                                [b]a -= 1;[/b]
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>bolded out what i think could fix this.</p>
