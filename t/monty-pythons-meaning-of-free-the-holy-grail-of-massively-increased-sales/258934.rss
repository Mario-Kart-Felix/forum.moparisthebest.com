    <title>Monty Python&#39;s Meaning Of Free: The Holy Grail Of Massively Increased Sales</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Last year, we wrote about Monty Python&#39;s decision to put all its content online for free hoping that would drive people to buy more of its scarce goods -- such as DVDs. And, as a bunch of you have submitted, it appears to have worked wonders. Monty Pyton&#39;s DVD sales jumped an astounding 23,000% and are now the number 2 best selling item in the Movies &amp; TV category on Amazon.com. Who was it that said &quot;you can&#39;t compete with free&quot; again?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wow, that&#39;s great. I haven&#39;t seen any of the Monty Python, but I have them downloaded.. maybe I should watch them soon.</description>
