    <title>I have a problem with my pickup command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-a-problem-with-my-pickup-command/217847</link>
    <description>Hello, I am currently working on my first server ever. I am using PimpScape as my source. I just added Jagex items to my server and changed the &quot;Pickup&quot; command to work with Jagex items. Now the problem im having is when I spawn a Jagex item like a skillcape, I can wear it but when I take it off it turns into boots with the ID (9999). If you have any idea of what may be causing this, I will appreciate the help very much.

Thank You
