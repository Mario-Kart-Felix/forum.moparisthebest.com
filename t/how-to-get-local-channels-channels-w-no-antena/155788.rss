    <title>How to get local Channels channels w/ no antena</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-get-local-channels-channels-w-no-antena/155788</link>
    <description>[b]This is for TV&#39;s that do not have a scanner that picks up local channels, most newer ones do but some don&#39;t.[/b]

[b]Needed items:[/b] A TV, A cable cord, a pop can, tape.
[b]Intelegance: 1.5[/b] i can&#39;t spell obviously.
[b]
Step one:[/b] If the TV is not plugged in plug it in... |-.-|
[b]
Step Two:[/b] Plug in the cable if it is not plugged in... |-.-|

[b]Step Three:[/b] [i]oh no this part is harder![/i] [b]WARNING: make sure the popcan is empty...[/b]

1. Take the cord and that little thing that sticks out in center of the plug in part of the cord, take that tip to the top or inside of the pop can, and then put the can ontop the TV and make sure nothing is touching it.

[b]step four:[/b] scan for local channels and adjust the cable inside the popcan to make it clearer. 

[b]This tutorial is for people who are to retarded to know about the invisible signals that flow thru the air.[/b]
