    <title>Need death!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-death/167698</link>
    <description>did you people notice that when you get killed in the wilderness you fall (animation of death).Notice that when you do the emote youre still wearing youre items (Drop timer).

Im not an experienced coder, but i ask you to teach me how to add death.

Some people here are complete noobs (me).
Some people i wanna marry...

But what is it to add a few timers (disequip items, and drop them.) and an animation (death (bow down somthing...or falling))

Btw i quit runescape. For the man who gives me the propper tutorial gets my level 82 account (hypnoplasma). (i sware to god jagex are fucking loosers one of a kind l0l @ andrew...)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 26, 2007, 02:25:03 PM[/size][hr]omg reply pls!~</description>
