    <description>*Didn&#39;t know if this belonged in client or server section so I posted in both. If it&#39;s against the rules to do so, please lock one of the threads.

(I&#39;d honestly prefer you read the whole thing than just the tl;dr)  
tl;dr My brother can&#39;t connect to my server; I&#39;ve gone through 2 clients and server sources; We are using the same wireless internet
inb4 you didn&#39;t portforward correctly
inb4 edit client &amp; server files, I already did [I&#39;m not that new]  

Hello everyone. I&#39;ve gotten back into the RSPS fad, and have been working on a server. I&#39;ve used two different servers and two different clients, but no matter what I do, my brother can&#39;t connect. I&#39;ve set the client&#39;s GUI to connect to my server address, even my local wifi address, but it says &quot;Error connecting to server&quot;. It does that for both clients. Yes I have portforwarded correctly, I&#39;ve used websites to check if port 43594 is open and they say it is. My server and No-IP DUC are running when he tries to connect. Yes we are both connected to the internet. I&#39;ve got a NetGear router if that helps at all. I&#39;m not sure if this is a client problem or a server problem. Maybe you just aren&#39;t allowed to connect to the internet if you&#39;re using the same wifi, but we never had troubles before when we had a LinkSys router back in &#39;08 - &#39;09. If someone could volunteer to try to connect through my server&#39;s client that would be great because then it would let me see if it&#39;s my internet and server or not. By the way, my computer is 64-bit, his is 32-bit</description>

<p>Hello everyone. I’ve gotten back into the RSPS fad, and have been working on a server. I’ve used two different servers and two different clients, but no matter what I do, my brother can’t connect. I’ve set the client’s GUI to connect to my server address, even my local wifi address, but it says “Error connecting to server”. It does that for both clients. Yes I have portforwarded correctly, I’ve used websites to check if port 43594 is open and they say it is. My server and No-IP DUC are running when he tries to connect. Yes we are both connected to the internet. I’ve got a NetGear router if that helps at all. I’m not sure if this is a client problem or a server problem. Maybe you just aren’t allowed to connect to the internet if you’re using the same wifi, but we never had troubles before when we had a LinkSys router back in '08 - '09. If someone could volunteer to try to connect through my server’s client that would be great because then it would let me see if it’s my internet and server or not. By the way, my computer is 64-bit, his is 32-bit</p>
