    <title>Pranking other members</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pranking-other-members/466152</link>
    <description>It&#39;s come to my attention that recently there has been an increase in members pranking each other, whether this be with chickens, or boats or even flooding peoples property because they think it&#39;s a laugh. While I&#39;m sure your best friend shares this sense of humor not all of us do, therefore I&#39;m going to reiterate what I&#39;ve said in the past in regards to pranking and the risk you take if you want to be the community clown.

Allow me to present two situations, if you prank somebody (say a new member for example) and they don&#39;t find it funny, and want to proceed with the fact you broke the rules you will be punished. In the past we have had members pay others diamonds to stop reporting them, but the staff reserve the right to go ahead regardless of any player made deals. The opposite situation is if you prank a close friend, and they think it is great, and you simply are playing with each other. If this is the case you will not be punished (Unless it&#39;s completely unreasonable, this includes abuse of TNT and such to help these pranks).

The point and message of this topic is simple: If you want to be a jackass, do so at your own risk. If you miscalculate their reaction you WILL be punished.</description>
