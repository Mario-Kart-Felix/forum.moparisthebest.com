    <title>Is your problem this? Ask yourself</title>

    <description>[b]If something on your server isn&#39;t going in the order it&#39;s supposed to, it&#39;s not doing anything at all when you have the code compiled for it, then there really is nothing [u]we[/u] can do for you.[/b] 

[i]Java&#39;s DatagramPackets do not guarantee proper delivery order or even delivery. If you have one of the problems above, work on getting a better internet connection and it will resolve it. Having too many people online for your connection may also cause the problem above.[/i]
