    <title>Nibiru</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nibiru/464660</link>
    <description>I was browsing Youtube and came across a video talking about Planet Nibiru, which was supposedly discovered in ancient times and obviously tied in from religious/cultural views; however, I will not bring those into this discussion. If you haven&#39;t noticed, there have been different sightings since April which have increased astronomers&#39; belief as to Planet Nibiru being real. There are many videos you can find that show Nibiru beside and above the Sun during the period of time from April to October, which people believe is an effect due to the axis of Earth tilting. 

I just wanted to see what everyone else thought about this; please keep any religious matters out of your reply, although I highly respect these types of views. I&#39;m not trying to encourage any apocalyptic event or anything close to that, so don&#39;t get that thought.</description>

              <p>Seriously? Defining a fucking astronomer and programmer as the same thing; it doesn’t matter if the person is just a freelancer or not, they still hold that position or title. I’m not trying to prove anything here, so stop replying with something that doesn’t matter. Also, the astronomers were wrong to a certain extent, because they changed their mind. Pluto was no longer a planet as of 2006. It doesn’t matter if it is a slight distinction of a planet now, that doesn’t change the fact of it being a dwarf planet; I know what a planet is in comparison to a dwarf planet, so I don’t need the clarification of it. Thanks for your input on this though.</p>

</aside>
<p>they’re not ‘the same people’ any more than say, a doctor from the united states and a doctor from kazakhstan ‘are the same (group of) people’</p>
<p>pluto is a ‘dwarf’ planet, the astronomers who classified pluto as a ‘planet’ <span class="bbcode-b">weren’t</span> wrong and this is important to know</p>
<p>up until pluto was called a ‘dwarf’ planet the definition of a planet would have included pluto, the ruling that classified pluto as a dwarf planet sets a proper definition for what is to be considered a planet and what is to be considered a dwarf planet and/or satellite</p>
<p>and lets get this straight, a dwarf planet has nothing to do with size, ‘dwarf planet’ as a name means nothing</p>
<p>a planet is defined as:</p>
<p>The IAU … resolves that planets and other bodies, except satellites, in our Solar System be defined into three distinct categories in the following way:<br>
(1) A planet1 is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and © has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.</p>
<p>this means that a planet is a planet if (a) it orbits the sun (both pluto and earth do this) (b) is round (both pluto and earth are) © basically that the orbit of a planet is unassisted by other celestial bodies, (which earth does, pluto does not)</p>
<p>a dwarf planet is defined as:</p>
<p>(2) A “dwarf planet” is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape,2 © has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite.</p>
<p>the orbit of pluto around the sun is assisted by other celestial bodies that without such bodies, would not be able to complete an orbit of the sun, for the other 8 planets this is not true, the 8 planets we have are able to complete their orbit of the sun unassisted from any other celestial body</p>
<p>just the fact that neptune IS a planet means that pluto can never be a planet, neptune is preventing pluto from orbiting because it got ‘there first’</p>

<p>well you see, the problem here is that you have 1 story/explanation of what ‘nibiru’ is in a sea of about a million stories or explanations</p>
<p>the reason no one takes shit like nibiru seriously is because no one explains themselves and sticks to vague answers that could stick to just about everything, “nibiru is a planet beyond neptune!!! so is pluto!!! therefore pluto is nibiru!!!”</p>
<p>there’s also a school of thought that is that nibiru is a planet beyond pluto:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.crystalinks.com/nibiru_planets.jpg" alt width="600" height="450"></p>
<p>hint: pluto was discovered in <span class="bbcode-b">1930</span>, in this day and age we can detect planets <span class="bbcode-b">4,500 lightyears</span> away from the dip in brightness they cause by the orbit of their sun, if there was a freaking planet in our solar system that has yet to been discovered by now it would have been discovered and if said planet was visible from the eye then it would have been discovered centuries ago</p>
