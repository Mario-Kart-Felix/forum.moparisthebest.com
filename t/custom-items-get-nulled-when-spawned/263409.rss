    <title>Custom Items Get Nulled When Spawned</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-items-get-nulled-when-spawned/263409</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I currently downloaded KingScape Client and ShortRide-Scape Source. Unlike other servers and clients this ran with no problem, nice and lagg free. The only problem I had was that when I try to spawn a custom item it shows up as a null. I have the customs added on the client...so am guessing this has something to do with the source? Also don&#39;t say that I have to click add models...because I&#39;ve already done that. So if anybody good help me out, I&#39;d really appreciate it.</description>
