Dude I&#39;m afraid to even make out with her

~i~ 10:02:29 PM
I just feel really bad about it because she likes me a lot. I don&#39;t want a long term relationship

~~n 10:02:29 PM
I just feel really bad about it because she likes me a lot. I don&#39;t want a long term relationship&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Okay so I won&#39;t say names, but we need to discuss the idea of relationships. This person, who shall not be named, wants to break up with his girlfriend because he wants to feel rejection from other girls. He is 17, and she is either 14 or 15. This person says they have nothing in common and they never see each other. Do you think this is a legitimate reason to break up with her?

Also, how long have you guys held your relationships? Why do you enjoy spending time with your girlfriend/boyfriend? Tips for said person?</description>

              <p>[quote=“casey., post:17, topic:469173”]Make it a point no to cheat, the reputation will stick and that could cause later problems.</p>
<p>Compatibility has to be a must in a relationship, if it lacks it is pointless.[/quote]<br>
This right here. No matter what goes in through your head, no matter what you feel, don’t cheat. I overheard some girls talking a few days ago and it went something like this (details, nor names aren’t remembered. Oh it wasn’t talking, it was a fight, lol.)<br>
G1: Don’t you dare touch my man, I’ve been with him for months.<br>
G2: what are you talking about ‘your man’ me and him have been on and off.<br>
G1: He started dating me on one of your ‘off periods’.<br>
G2: He’s always done that, but he ends up cheating on the other girl with me, then we start dating again.<br>
Something like that. Some of the “he’s” had his name, again can’t remember all of it.<br>
But seriously, what ever you do, don’t cheat. If anyone does, let the girl cheat so you aren’t to blame, plus, you can use the old excuse ‘I didn’t know she was in a relationship’. I know I’ve done it more then once, my reputation hasn’t been damaged since. Actually, I think it’s improved cause of it. But if you want experimentation, find a girl you like, not for looks, but for personality, make she she likes you to, then explain to her the situation. She will know what to do out of anyone. If you’re just looking for some girls to fuck. Walk around, smell for fish, head that way, find the girl with the smell, that’s your girl.</p>

Definitely think this is the best response, don’t break her heart even more by cheating, break up with her and she could move on and stay friends and whatever, if you cheat and she finds out then that’s entering a whole new world of trouble, plus then word might spread and no girl from your school would want you because you are a “cheater”[/quote]</p>

<p>Okay so I won’t say names, but we need to discuss the idea of relationships. This person, who shall not be named, wants to break up with his girlfriend because he wants to feel rejection from other girls. He is 17, and she is either 14 or 15. This person says they have nothing in common and they never see each other. Do you think this is a legitimate reason to break up with her?</p>
<p>Also, how long have you guys held your relationships? Why do you enjoy spending time with your girlfriend/boyfriend? Tips for said person?[/quote]</p>
<p>There’s a few points that i would like to make here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It’s wrong for this guy to keep with her. It’s just stringing her along. Firstly, the age difference is too great. Especially that young. Also, why stick with someone that you have zero in common with and barely see?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s 17. Exploring the single life is a great part of being a teenager. Experiencing many types of different women allows us to figure out what’s compatible. You learn what qualities in a girl work for you and which don’t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy seems to have a lot of insecurities. To want to be rejected? Games only work on the insecure. ‘Chase’ only works on the insecure. Within, he doesn’t feel great about himself and wants to try prove that he’s good enough for a girl that starts off by rejecting him. A form of validation if you will. This girl accepts him, he feels like he doesn’t need to prove himself and then he subconsciously decides that she’s not too great because of this. It’s a trick of the mind. However, it’s toxic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not her that’s the problem. It’s him. He’s not good enough for her. The internal emotional stability isn’t there for him. My suggestion? Tell him to start working on himself. Read, learn, explore, travel and hit the gym. He confidence will skyrocket, games and the desire to be rejected will disappear and he will have experienced single life enough to know what sort of girl he wants.</p>
<blockquote>Also, how long have you guys held your relationships? Why do you enjoy spending time with your girlfriend/boyfriend? Tips for said person?</blockquote>
<p>I’ve had a few fairly lengthy relationships that i learned a lot from. Majority were positive experience even though they seemed negative at the time. Why do i enjoy hanging out with a girl i am into? It’s the greatest feeling in the world to be able to make a woman smile and laugh. There’s this huge sense of masculinity when you’re protecting someone you care about from the emotional strain of every day life. Relaxing, being accepted and sharing your most biggest vulnerabilities is a feeling that you can’t compare to anything else.</p>
<p>DO NOT CHEAT. It’s a path that you really don’t want to go down.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
