    <title>Iran threatens to torpedo US carriers</title>

    <description>So we haven&#39;t discussed the bullshit skirmish brewing in the middle east yet

&lt;blockquote&gt;Iran might pound Persian Gulf cities with ballistic missiles and use swift boats to attack American war ships in an attempt to dissuade a U.S. attack on its nuclear arms sites, a new report states.

[Iran Flexes Military Muscle in Persian Gulf.]

Tehran likely would employ a mixed game plan against the U.S. military consisting of &quot;advanced technology&quot; and &quot;guerilla tactics,&quot; according to a research organization with close ties to the Pentagon.

Before that, Iran would first lean hard on weaker Middle Eastern nations to convince those states to deny Washington access to bases on their soil, it states.

Some of the report&#39;s grimmer scenarios predict Iranian ballistic missile launches on Gulf cities in an attempt to convince other nations to resist providing support to an American military operation.

The report also forecasts efforts by Tehran to use Shiite Muslim &quot;proxy groups&quot; to attack U.S. allies in the region. Similar groups plagued the U.S.-led war effort in Iraq for years, and some officials and experts said some acted with Tehran&#39;s backing. [Cantor Presses for More Pressure on Iran.]

Anthony Cordesman, a Pentagon adviser, acknowledged Iranian officials might give some kind of support to extremist groups in a place like Yemen.

But he cast doubt on the likelihood that Iran would fire missiles at Gulf cities, or if its missiles would even work. [How Iran Could Affect Your Wallet in 2012.]

&quot;Iran is much more likely to look at this and realize when you see this type of exchange, you ignore the fact that there are no rules as to how the U.S. and others would respond,&quot; said Cordesman, a senior analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

An Iranian missile barrage on Gulf population centers, he said, could lead the United States and its allies to &quot;take out their oil refineries.&quot;

&quot;Then, their economy grinds to a halt,&quot; Cordesman said. &quot;If Iran can&#39;t export [oil], it can&#39;t earn. And that creates critical problems for the regime.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lol&#39;d at the comments


Launch One Nuke into an unpopulated desert in Iran (Or that Nuke Plant) and then tell them; Next Time we won&#39;t miss (Tehran). Guarantee they will cave and change their tune forever.


What a bunch of morons. I guess they (iranians) don&#39;t realize the difference in fighting a guerilla type war on the high seas as compared to on the ground. What do they plan to do? Hide behind a wave until they get close enough to fire?</description>

<p>Trust me, pissing on the enemy happens just as often as a halo characters crouching on the dead. They just don’t film it. When your a soldier your mind really is not normal for that period of your life. You guys act like its “sick” but if you were in the situation you would be pissing away on your enemies as well.</p>

<p>I don’t see how this could have unfolded, but it’s worrying.[/quote]<br>
In all honesty that doesn’t sound like he wanted to murder everyone intentionally. They could have let him off with a warning, you should be happy he at least got 3 months.</p>
<p>And it wouldn’t surprise me if they put a bomb on the guy in a wheelchair, hell, they put a bomb in a 2 year olds bottle.Its not uncommon for citizens to be forced to walk into troops with bombs on them, and not only that, its hard to tell who is who.</p>
<p>But I personally think he should have at least gotten a year or so, because its hard to be threatened by someone running AWAY from you.</p>
<p>And mitb pointed it out quite well, he admitted to ordering them to be killed but he didn’t walk down the street bored and slaughter them, he was trying to protect his men. Maybe if they didn’t fight like cowards we could tell the difference <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Actually Radeon, they reduced it from 3 months to no time at all and it made healdines: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/marine-serve-no-time-iraqi-killings-case-224428172.html">http://news.yahoo.com/marine-serve-no-time-iraqi-killings-case-224428172.html</a> which means alot of people are going to be watching the case now</p>
<p>really good comment on that article though:</p>
<blockquote>Under the circumstances of war, he probably was in shock from the fact one is subject to lose his life any moment. You don't go to war and tip toe around playing peek-a-boo. Some never made it back. Why does the country send people to war and expect them to act naturally? We didn't belong there in the first place and the enemy doesn't play fair. Then you come back and they point you to the street and tell you to go ahead and enjoy your life. No More War!</blockquote>
<p>But it still sends the wrong message by making it seem as if civilians are expendable</p>

<p>Most Afghan citizens don’t like the Taliban. But they do realize that the Taliban are Muslims too, and US soldiers are not. So that’s a cultural/religious gap between Afghans and the soldiers, but a ‘bridge’ between Afghans and the Taliban. So they have a feeling that even though the Taliban is the enemy, they are on the same team too. Apparently, military training is all about using weapons and killing people, but interaction with friendly citizens is something soldiers don’t know anything about.</p>
<p>To get to the point: pissing on a corpse is wrong, but pissing on a corpse in a nation that’s completely different from yours is the dumbest thing you could ever do. And when they even put it on tape, they make you wonder what the hell they are doing there in the first place. The joke is that when you can’t do jackshit you join the army, but even the army should have standards that prevent idiots like this from joining.</p>

Yeah I think the only reason this happens is because these soldiers have no idea why they’re even there, and so resort to these sick acts to kill their own emotion and reasoning.<br>
[/quote][/quote]<br>
I can see how a zionist christian would have that motivation but your typical US soldier doesn’t want anything to do with illegal israel.<br>
Theyre there because they can be and it allows them to monitor shit with Israel</p>

              <p>oh come on you act like it wouldn’t happen? What does everyone do in MWF, Halo or any other FPS game when they get a cool kill or completely dominate another player? Teabag the corpse, Knife the Corpse, Spray paint the corpse. You don’t think this style of thinking is actually applied in real life? its been going on for years every war has some sort of drama like this. Japs raping Chinese girls, cutting heads and displaying them, pissing on a corpse. The fact is during a war people really show how dark they are and everyone knows it. These few had just been stupid enough to post it online for the entire public to see.</p>
