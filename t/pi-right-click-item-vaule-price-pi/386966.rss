    <description>alright, i recently change a pvp shop into a normal shop, so you can buy with coins not pvp tokens. i fixed it so you can buy with coins and changed the prices of my items but when i click value it says they cost 0 coins, but really they don&#39;t you still haft to buy them for 1.5b, does anyone know how i can change the right click value to the normal price e.g 1.5b

and also i added a ::modhp command and i wont to add it so when you do it you get kicked so when you login the hp would have changed instead of login out after you do it.
 
 if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;modhp&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {
                        c.playerLevel[3] = 200000000;
               }

               if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;modhpoff&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {
                        c.playerLevel[3] = 135;
               }

thankyou base:pi</description>
