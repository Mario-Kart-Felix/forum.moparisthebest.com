    <title>Swan Song</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/swan-song/338492</link>
    <description>My name is The Reaper X. Many of you know me from my releases I&#39;ve made in my earliest weeks here, others might know me just as a friend. I suppose some of you might have some form resentment towards me, but that hasn&#39;t stopped me from looking ahead. I&#39;ve always come to Moparscape by the end of the day, along with the rest of you; the reeling. At this moment, I&#39;ve come to realize that I no longer have the same reaction when I visit here than I did in the beginning. There is no aspiration of relief, no obvious potential, no legitimate collaboration, and no family. My family resides in those that talk to me outside this forum.

Note, this probably isn&#39;t the last post I make, as most members come back. I&#39;d just like to say that Moparscape has been an incredible experience, and has taught me more than anyone or thing that I&#39;ve ever been introduced to. If I don&#39;t return, I&#39;d hope that the community would hold strong. I&#39;ve been through a lot these last few years, and I hope that I&#39;ve made an impact in at least one of you.

I used to tell myself that if I were to ever leave this community, I wouldn&#39;t make a thread. But I feel, to uphold the tradition of my earlier days, that it&#39;s necessary to make such a thing. I&#39;ll miss most of you for my leave, but until then, you know who you are.

No administrators care about moparscape except for niall, and hes gone now. Taharok would still be here and the community would be doing WAY better if his, niall’s, and tico’s plans were never ignored. And believe me, they’ve practically written books on the entire moparscape reform, but no one takes them seriously and they get the tl;dr. I dont why progression is being avoided.</p>

<p>Sure, the whole RS cheating scene affects all of us addicted ones greatly. I’ve made so many friendships that it’s impossible to not be on IRC. But until the quality of this site changes, it will lose more “elders” and “intelligent” people.</p>

              <p>My name is The Reaper X. Many of you know me from my releases I’ve made in my earliest weeks here, others might know me just as a friend. I suppose some of you might have some form resentment towards me, but that hasn’t stopped me from looking ahead. I’ve always come to Moparscape by the end of the day, along with the rest of you; the reeling. At this moment, I’ve come to realize that I no longer have the same reaction when I visit here than I did in the beginning. There is no aspiration of relief, no obvious potential, no legitimate collaboration, and no family. My family resides in those that talk to me outside this forum.</p>
<p>Note, this probably isn’t the last post I make, as most members come back. I’d just like to say that Moparscape has been an incredible experience, and has taught me more than anyone or thing that I’ve ever been introduced to. If I don’t return, I’d hope that the community would hold strong. I’ve been through a lot these last few years, and I hope that I’ve made an impact in at least one of you.</p>
<p>I used to tell myself that if I were to ever leave this community, I wouldn’t make a thread. But I feel, to uphold the tradition of my earlier days, that it’s necessary to make such a thing. I’ll miss most of you for my leave, but until then, you know who you are.</p>
