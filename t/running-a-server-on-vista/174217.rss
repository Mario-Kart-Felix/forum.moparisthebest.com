    <title>Running a server on vista?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/running-a-server-on-vista/174217</link>
    <description>Has anyone figured out how yet? because i know me and quite a few other people i have known have had this problem. I am not stupid so dont act like that. I had my server running on my pc and people could connect. but now im trying to get one running on my laptop with vista. problem is people cant connect. ive exceptioned the firewall have everything i need to run it. i can connect from localarea. but not from the noip. so for somereason its stopping at the router. but ive already port forwarded the router from my pc would i need to do it again? or is it something else i need to do with vista.</description>

              <p>I have Vista and servers run just fine… It’s just that Vista can’t hold as many people on your server, especially on a laptop computer with vista.</p>
<p>Just disable your firewall all together, and if it still doesn’t work… then its your anti virus software.</p>
