        <p>You could call this a survey, but I need some opinions. I am developing a library, by which the specifications of said library I cannot tell you. All I can say is that its containments are very broad, and go well beyond my experience. I need experience from people who spend more time in certain parts than others, that way I can get the most diverse and accurate opinions. The following categories are:</p>
<p>~ Artificial Intelligence <span class="bbcode-i">(event based?)</span><br>
~ Animations <span class="bbcode-i">(framed animations, procedural animations, particle system, anything else?)</span><br>
~ User/action input <span class="bbcode-i">(mouse, keyboard, joystick, etc)</span><br>
~ IO <span class="bbcode-i">(chunk based reading system? NIO or IO?)</span><br>
~ Networking <span class="bbcode-i">(both TCP and UDP support)</span><br>
~ Physics <span class="bbcode-i">(any physics engines already made for Java?)</span><br>
~ Rendering <span class="bbcode-i">(what types of methods would you suggest?)</span><br>
~ User Interface system <span class="bbcode-i">(I thought of abstraction here with event based systems just like AWT, good or bad?)</span><br>
~ Scene Graph system <span class="bbcode-i">(I need suggestions of types of generic Objects that could be placed in the scene [models, sprites, geometrical sprites, geometrical models (list some)])</span><br>
~ Sound <span class="bbcode-i">(seems simple, any suggestions?)</span></p>
<p>It is obvious these categories build that of a game engine library. Do not turn away just yet. I am not asking to debate with you whether I am competent enough or adequete to build this library, that is not the point. I simply what your opinion on any (or all) of the above categories. This opinion is simply supposed to give me options.</p>
<p>What is the opinion? Well, I need to know what you think each category would be like implementation-wise in a library. Like, answer some of the following questions (example-wise):</p>
<ul>
<li>What methods do the said component have?</li>
<li>Does the component support hardware acceleration or portability (or both)?</li>
<li>Is the component open source?</li>
<li>How powerful is it?</li>
</ul>
<p>I need these/more answered for an accurate option. I leave the rest up to you. If you do choose to help me, my many thanks and gratitude toward you.</p>

<p>Yes yes, first I spelled it survey, thought it looked wrong, switched it to survay, and yeah… well.</p>
<p>And thanks for the luck of making the engine, all the more required <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>Taharok, you probably won’t pay any attention to this post as you think I am an idiot.  But regardless, I will still post it.</p>
<p>The thing which a lot of people get stuck on is the structure.  They know the logic behind it, but not so much how to put it into clean and tidy code.</p>
<p>Structure wise, you have a few simple classes to make for a few categories.  You could create a single “sound” class, which handles the playing of all sounds, perhaps based on a String argument as the name of the sound.  If you wanted to go above and beyond you could treat it like your own player, which will play your own format.  But that is unneeded.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the two hardest parts you will find is the Game AI and the “Scene Graph System”.  You have not revealed exactly what sort of game this is, however any new age game requires a complex graph system in order to hold nice renders for your graphics.</p>
<p>With the Game AI, we already know a few things.  For example, it will require more than one class.  Otherwise it would be very messy.  There are many things you need to take into account.  You need to allow it to “think” logically.  Say you were making a strategy game, you need it to “think” about what to build first or what tanks to make when etc.</p>
<p>But more than that, it needs to have multiple different patterns, else it would act the same way every time.  It needs to be able to react to what’s going on around it, so lets say you send your tanks in to attack the enemy base, the enemy (computer AI) will send it’s tanks in to defend it.  This is where I think ActionListeners could come into play.  If you made a class that handles certain aspects via an ActionListener (ex. When you run out of tanks, the ActionListener kicks in telling you to build more).</p>
<p>Here are some resources, and even some code:</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply the bank. The most difficult part I have faced yet is the structure, just as you said it is usually the hardest part. I think the structure I created is well done, but perhaps the idea is just impractical. After I finish enough of it to be happy with it, I will be posting a UML diagram of it on here, to see what your opinions are.</p>
<p>The Scene Graph system has proved to be tricky, but nothing super difficult. I was a little vague with my description of the library in my first post. This library is a gaming engine library, meaning it is designed to be implemented to create virtually any game imaginable. With that in mind, the library becomes tenfold as difficult to create, because one has to bear in mind what will be and what will not be used during the creation of the engine.</p>
<p>The Artificial Intelligence part of the engine isn’t even structured yet, because I was developing the other sections (and still am). I never really thought about how the AI was going to work, but those links and your suggestion of event-based listeners gave me a few ideas. It seems the only way possible <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> to use an event system, but the AI will still be incredibly limited on response. It will also be incredibly difficult to create such a system with unlimited possibilities of complexity and response entirely built upon an implementation system.</p>

<p>How do you plan to build a User Interface system which can be used in more than one game?  Unless you plan on making your own components?</p>
<p>As for a generic AI…that starts to become very complex.  AI structure will vary greatly on the type of game which is being made.  For example, if someone made a pong game, they would need a simple AI to move up and down as the ball comes it’s way.  Whereas a strategy game like the one I gave you an example of, would require a complex AI with multiple possible strategies.</p>
<p>Just an idea, but maybe instead of building a whole AI system for your library, you could build a simple event based system, say a class called GameEvent.  When someone using your library creates a new GameEvent, they provide the code for both the action, and the reaction, while the GameEvent class puts it into action and creates a (threaded?) check system on that event.  I’m not sure if that is what you are looking for though.</p>

<p>Yes, the User-Interface system is going to be entirely made from scratch for the library. I don’t want to go into detail on the benefits of doing this, because it will give away some of the parts of the library I don’t want people to know yet. In this engine, there are only two ways to display something on the screen. These include the UI system, and the Scene Graph system. Both are ‘wrappers’ to the rendering engine, which actually does the pixel manipulation/graphics acceleration/etc. The UI system is barely anywhere along, and will take the absolute longest to make, only next to the Scene Graph.</p>
<p>I was thinking about doing something similar after the other post you posted. The AI system <span class="bbcode-i">has</span> to be manipulated through custom code by the implementor, or I would have a lot of work to do. However, in my train of thought, I was going to develop the AI system to run just to manipulate objects depending on physics. The physics engine is the one that actually detects collision, etc, and builds an animation for response. The animation obviously is run through and transforms the object. So really, the AI system has a lot less work to be done on it. All I can imagine doing right off the bat is building some sort of method to allow any object in the scene graph to be randomly moved throughout the scene, but not outside a specified bounding box or the like.</p>

        <p>It could technically, but the way I set up my scene graph would make a UI system underneath it just plain impractical. The Scene Graph I set up allows a person to draw one of three types of Objects, including a Sprite, a Geometrical Shape, and a Model. When adding to the scene graph, each object is surrounded with a bounding box (2D or 3D). This box is meant to be used by the physics engine to check for collision detection. Eventually, the system will also support bounding spheres and polygonal models to allow for precise area checking.</p>

        <p>An abstract user interface system would mean the user would have to play a fairly large role in the whole scene. When it comes down to a commercial project, <span class="bbcode-i">especially</span> a game engine, I’m sure the user would like to have that part of it packaged and ready to be used rather than spending time filling in the gaps you left open. Keep it the way the majority of your game engine is already set up, and stick with that concept. I’m sure you can incorporate a basic component system (class) that can be used if the user wishes to create and manage their own components. All in all, keep your current setup (implementation-based), create a component base/structure for others to build upon (so the entire abstract concept may be used just for this part), and create a system that will manage all prepackaged components and ones that could be built by users.</p>
<p>Make sure all components on-screen are being monitored and are repainted when they need to be. Sun set up their UI system poorly, in my opinion, and there a few mishaps that can occur that leave your component only half-drawn or half-showing. I can’t recall any specifics occurences at the moment, but I’m sure there have been a few in the past that I’ve run into.</p>
<p>Plan out your LAF sytem/engine. There are many ways to create custom LAFs for the engine. Two examples include an abstract core, like the way Sun has it set up, and a scriptable system in programs such as Trillian (multi-protocol IM client). I’d prefer something other than an abstract engine, because Sun’s method irritates me. Trillian’s method is just plain scripting. Sure, it’s a lot more resource dependent and costly when speaking on a technical level, but it’s also more user-friendly and would be a great start to a public community for the engine (the makers of Trillian mastered this concept over at their online forum).</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about component interaction, or more specifically so, the dragging of a component. Be sure to allow the ability to drag components, objects, or whatever you like to call them; as this is a big thing especially for games. Sun already supports the dragging of the mouse and sends the coordinates of the new position the mouse has been dragged to anytime dragging occurs to the appropriate listener. You should look into that, as I really do not feel like going into detail on this one.</p>
<p>Enable support for external, but commonly used, file formats/specifications.

        <p>[quote=“TeleNubby, post:15, topic:234753”]An abstract user interface system would mean the user would have to play a fairly large role in the whole scene. When it comes down to a commercial project, <span class="bbcode-i">especially</span> a game engine, I’m sure the user would like to have that part of it packaged and ready to be used rather than spending time filling in the gaps you left open. Keep it the way the majority of your game engine is already set up, and stick with that concept. I’m sure you can incorporate a basic component system (class) that can be used if the user wishes to create and manage their own components. All in all, keep your current setup (implementation-based), create a component base/structure for others to build upon (so the entire abstract concept may be used just for this part), and create a system that will manage all prepackaged components and ones that could be built by users.</p>
<p>Make sure all components on-screen are being monitored and are repainted when they need to be. Sun set up their UI system poorly, in my opinion, and there a few mishaps that can occur that leave your component only half-drawn or half-showing. I can’t recall any specifics occurences at the moment, but I’m sure there have been a few in the past that I’ve run into.</p>
<p>Plan out your LAF sytem/engine. There are many ways to create custom LAFs for the engine. Two examples include an abstract core, like the way Sun has it set up, and a scriptable system in programs such as Trillian (multi-protocol IM client). I’d prefer something other than an abstract engine, because Sun’s method irritates me. Trillian’s method is just plain scripting. Sure, it’s a lot more resource dependent and costly when speaking on a technical level, but it’s also more user-friendly and would be a great start to a public community for the engine (the makers of Trillian mastered this concept over at their online forum).</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about component interaction, or more specifically so, the dragging of a component. Be sure to allow the ability to drag components, objects, or whatever you like to call them; as this is a big thing especially for games. Sun already supports the dragging of the mouse and sends the coordinates of the new position the mouse has been dragged to anytime dragging occurs to the appropriate listener. You should look into that, as I really do not feel like going into detail on this one.</p>
<p>Enable support for external, but commonly used, file formats/specifications. This includes things such as FLV playback and modifications (so an API built into your API to be used by your API - this goes for all supported formats), WMA, MP3, WMV, AVI, MPEG, BMP, PNG, etc.; but only when you have extra time available in the end. Possibly even networking protocols like FTP, HTTP, PHP, etc? This <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i">isn’t needed at all</span></span>, but could be a big help and a handy extension to a commercial game engine (if you plan on going <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> big with this one). Ah, I know! Create a plugin system for all this, set up a community, and let your users/members help with this! If you want, you can even make the plugin “language” “universal” (by that I mean your own script-system or anything similar - but only to stay away from Java and allow others to build on your engine as well).</p>
<p>If I can think of anything else I’ll come back. I’m fried right now and need to get back to homework. :([/quote]</p>
<p>Excellent ideas. I like the one especially about monitoring active components within the UI system. The UI and Scene Graph systems both pool directly into the rendering system, so as the rendering system enters its next phase of rendering, the UI and Scene systems do the same. This means I wouldn’t actually need to monitor the components.</p>
<p>About the abstraction, I was envisioning a library closer to AWT’s in that way. There are master component classes which all subclasses must follow. Then each of the subclasses provide color palettes, look and feel information, (if it is a child of an abstract container, then information on held components), and other stuff like borders. Then, of course, information about the corresponding subclass (like a button would store information about its click status, etc).</p>
<p>I don’t know how effective the formats you are suggesting will be, but it led me to some other ideas. The idea of using actual video in an UI system seems very appealing. As for specific video, sound, and image formats that the engine can load, well, that depends on the implementations. And, I don’t know what you meant exactly by the protocols you listed (since they seem more fit to be in the networking section), but that also led me to think of the possibility of having some simple HTML parsing and rendering in specific text boxes as the Swing package as.</p>
<p>The LAF system will be similar to Swing’s as well. Though, your suggestion of scripting also led me to another idea. This engine will eventually, in the long wrong, have various scripting supports (ranging from pre-processed scripts to bytecode based scripts). Scripting works very well with the cache system already built into the IO engine. As for allowing a LAF to be programmed either (or both) in a scripting and normal implementation manner, well then I would need to change a lot now before then, or it will be almost possible to convert. Thanks for the scripting idea.</p>
<p>And finally, for the dragging of components idea. I like this idea, and can’t wait to start experimenting with it. I am going to make it a long-term goal, as it is not going to be easy to do and will take a bit of work to finish.</p>

<p>I was planning on creating an OpenGL implementation of the rendering engine built on top of JOGL. This kind of gives away the beauty (in my opinion) of this engine, but it is entirely component based. The central hub of work is done in the GameEngine class (see below), where then it branches off into sub-engines. Sub-engines include the rendering engine, the IO engine, the networking engine, etc. Each engine provides a high-level interface for the implementation, which is privately instantiated and then publicly used by the user of the engine. The user is expected to pick which implementations to use (but I am planning on packaged implementations later on, yet I am not explaining them right now.)</p>
<p><span class="mention">@everyone</span>: The following link is a link to the brief documentation on this engine. As you will see, there is really <span class="bbcode-i">no</span> documentation. These documentations were compiled to create a general shell visualizing the bones and structure of the library. Many classes in the library are going to be removed, and more will be added. Right now the total adds up to over 100 classes (not including some of the portable implementations I have already started developing, whose documentation was not shown). Please give me feedback on this idea, now that you know what it is. I need to know the practicality of it, or if it is just plain stupid (CC please). Here is the link:</p>
