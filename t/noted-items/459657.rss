    <description>Having some trouble making some items noteable with the bank with PI. For example, Dragon Claws. Their unnoted id is 14484 and noted is 14485, but when i try to withdraw them as a note, it says this item can&#39;t be noted. And, if I spawn some noted claws, I bank them and they are still a note, and when I withdraw, they&#39;re still a note. What do I do? Can&#39;t find this anywhere, even tried google.</description>
