    <title>Probability question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/probability-question/430805</link>
    <description>The questions are all in italics

[b][i]Omar has a disc with a pointer that spins about the centre. When the centre is stopped, it stops on one of the numbers 1, 2, 3 or 4. The probability that it will stop on one of the numbers 1 to 3 is given in the table.

1. 0.35
2. 0.16
3. 0.27
4. ....
[/i][/b]

[b][i]a) work out the probability that the pointer will stop on 4
[/i][/b]
My answer was 0.22

[b][i]b) work out the probability that the pointer will stop on 1 or 3
[/i][/b]
My answer was 0.62


[b][i]c) Omar is going to spin the pointer 75 times. Work out an estimate for the number of times the pointer will stop on 2[/i][/b]

This is the one I&#39;m having trouble with :L There is obviously a relation between the probability of a certain outcome and the number of times the event is repeated, but I&#39;m having trouble getting it.

If you are going to post the answer, please show your working as well.
