    <title>War in Iraq</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/war-in-iraq/121517</link>
    <description>[center]Yeah, I know we hear enough about it on the news, about how the President is wasting United States tax dollars. Anyhow, aren&#39;t teenagers, and whoever else runs/is part of these forums aloud to have an opinion? I want to hear what you think about President Bush, if you think this war is really necessary, and I don&#39;t care if you are from Russia, or Iraq, post. It doesn&#39;t matter if you are from America, just no flaming, and don&#39;t say that any country is better than any others. We all have problems, for instance, the United states, is the richest country in the world currently. I would say about more than 40% of the population is overweight, and our citizens do  not care for one another. If you look at other cultures compared to ours, we are selfish towards one another.  That&#39;s off topic though. Post what you think about the troops, if you support them or not, ect, ect.[/center]

Before you do, I want everyone just to browse through these photo&#39;s, and read this poem thing, I found on a myspce bulletin.
--------------------------------------------------------------------[/center]
[center]You stay up for 16 hours
He stays up for days on end 
[IMG]http://i123.photobucket.com/albums/o304/KyleTheAlien/soilder1.jpg[/img]
You take a warm shower to help you wake up.
He goes days or weeks without running water.
[IMG]http://i123.photobucket.com/albums/o304/KyleTheAlien/dungeon3.jpg[/img]
You complain of a &quot;headache&quot;, and call in sick.
He gets shot at as others are hit, and keeps moving forward
[IMG]http://i123.photobucket.com/albums/o304/KyleTheAlien/soilder2.jpg[/img]
You put on your anti war/don&#39;t support the troops shirt, and go meet up with your friends.
He still fights for your right to wear that shirt
[IMG]http://i123.photobucket.com/albums/o304/KyleTheAlien/roflage219352894523.jpg[/img]
You talk trash about your &quot;buddies&quot; that aren&#39;t with you.
He knows he may not see some of his buddies again
[IMG]http://i123.photobucket.com/albums/o304/KyleTheAlien/erm.jpg[/img]
You roll your eyes as a baby cries.
He gets a letter with pictures of his new child, and wonders if they&#39;ll ever meet

<p>I for one have stated many times that I hate our government. But I DO Support my troops. We can type all of this, while there getting shot at. Some are there for college. Some are there for the experience.But I will never EVER talk trash to someone that had to witness what they had. It’s disrespectful.</p>

              <p>I believe in Jeffersonian democracy, and common sense. Defense means that the US does not get embroiled in foreign wars. In fact the US itself was founded because of this, exhorbatant taxes paid to sponsor Englands wars with France. All of the founding fathers repeatedly warned against this, as the ultimate killer of a democracy.</p>
<p>Offense as defense is Orwellian double-speak. The war in Iraq was sold by the US government as a “Pre-emptive strike”. It was an attack…that was actually defense. The truth is that more people die in the US from peanut allergies than terrorist attacks. If the US banned peanuts it would do a whole lot more for our “Defense” than the wars in the Middle East.</p>

              <p>Divine-Devil, you should quit posting now that you’ve explained how China bombed Pearl Harbour. You have said all that you need to say. We now know all we need to about you and your “Research”.</p>
<p>Lothy, first of all you say “Bush went to war”. The United States went to war, not Bush. If you really believe that the Bush (the US) went to war to “Save face” then tell me exactly what would have happened to Bush if he didn’t decide Iraq need invading? Was it that he failed to find Osama bin Laden? I find that hard to believe. I think he had to save something, but that was the US dollar, not his public facade. Politics is politics is politics. Bush’s approval rating is 29% right now and he still commuted the sentence of one of his cronies, Scooter Libby. He obviously doesn’t give a damn.</p>
<p>The realities of how the attacks on 9/11 happened <span class="bbcode-b">do not matter</span>, lothy. The important thing is that 9/11 had nothing to do with Iraq (this at least is a proven fact). The soldiers fighting in Iraq are not defending America. Even if Saddam Hussein funded Osama bin Laden to carry the 9/11 attacks out (ridiculous) the soldiers fighting in Iraq would not be defending America. They would be taking out revenge. Defense would be tightening our economic policy and investing in renewable resources so we could  stop being dependent on foreign oil and also to stop funding Israel which carries out many “Attacks” on civilian populations.</p>

<p>What do those pictures have to prove? There anger towards America. WE went into there country, made a lame excuse about Terror and Oil, and started a war.</p>
<p>Just like all the other wars we went into. WW1,WW2,Vietnam. ALL planed<br>
WW1 - We halted all trades with China. And sold guns to the enemy which was violations of war rules.China got mad and bombed pearl harbor</p>
<p>WW2- We sent a cruise boat into a war zone in which Germany sunk with torpedoes.</p>
<p>These are all causes by us, 9/11 was the same PLANED.<br>
Let’s compare 9/11 with history?</p>
<p>Adolf Hitler Set fire on Reichstag building in which he stayed in. Hitler used this as evidence that the communists were plotting against his government.</p>
<p>911 - Terrorist use planes as missles to take down the WTC’s and the Pentagon. They came of with the Theory that a “Pancake” effect came in place on the WTC’s, instead of them falling sideways. Controlled demolitions have the same effect? You can also see Squibs (which are small explosives) as the WTC’s are falling <a href="http://imageshack.us" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img224.imageshack.us/img224/5452/218wtcsquibs20500817221ft3.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a>.

<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>As for the War in Iraq: Damn…lots of you have your facts all screwed up. Do some research. And that means from reliable sources, because, according to Google, over 80% of the internet is porn and of he remaining 20%, less than 5% contains actual, factual, useful information. Use that 5%.[/quote]<br>
Nobody has brought figures or anything like that into this. However at the end of the day it really does boil down to politics.</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>As for the War in Iraq: Damn…lots of you have your facts all screwed up. Do some research. And that means from reliable sources, because, according to Google, over 80% of the internet is porn and of he remaining 20%, less than 5% contains actual, factual, useful information. Use that 5%.</p>

<p>I’m off to go better myself with php, I may debate later, unless it just goes beyond me even bothering to read with things like:</p>

MastrChief, you are linking to a thread where you repeatedly link Iraq to 9/11 and call people names to make your point. You know that, right?<br>

Social engineering is usually the art of using deceit to extract useful information. I don’t see any information being extracted from anyone in the post you quoted.</p>

<p>Lothy, are you talking about 9/11? I don’t see how that is related. Also, I know soldiers do what they are told in the army, but the US army right now is a volunteer army. The US is not being threatened right now by another nation (we are threatened, but by economic forces within our control). I believe a true patriot who wants to defend the United States should probably join a militia rather than the US army because the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have nothing to do with defending the US.</p>

<p>I’m talking about bombings and other attacks in general. Not necessarily those on American soil.</p>
<p>Presuming the attacks of terror on 9/11 were real, I’d say Bush went to war to save face. He’d cop a lot in the political realm if he didn’t; one of the reasons that Howard won’t withdraw Australian troops is because he wants to maintain a strong relationship with America.</p>
<p>Back to what you were saying about the US army not defending America. There’s no real way to know either way (whether 9/11 was real or set up because of corruption). If you see it from your point of view, then no the army isn’t defending America.<br>
Once again though, we come back to the fact that there’s no way you’ll really ever know either way. So if the attacks were real, then they are defending America in a sense.</p>

              <p>Divine-Devil, you can find symbols of anything anywhere. Semantics are fun but in the end if you want to figure out why the world is the way the world is you are better off looking at economics and historical fact. Stop repeating your strange nhilist creed, you are your own worst enemy. Bush’s relationship with war and the devil means nothing compared to the US dollars relationship to the Euro and OPEC oil production.</p>

<p>MastrChief, there is no social engineering going on here. We are exchanging information, opinions, ideas, in a purely electronic medium. If you don’t have anything to say, say nothing.</p>

No, I can’t. Having said that, you should know as well as I do that if you’re in the army then you do what they tell you to do.</p>
<p>It’s also worth pointing out that there have been attacks in other parts of the world. Even if your government did organise the attacks in America, they wouldn’t have organised them in places like Bali. You mentioned yourself that there wasn’t an ‘ultimate evil’ behind it all, and I’ll agree with that - there’s no way in the world that the American government is responsible for all of the other attacks.</p>

<p>I don’t believe that everything is evil,but everything is going on behind our backs as we all know it.Bush is going to be just like a Dictator.They been plaining this for years. there master plan? “One World Government” Where we all unite as one. And you might say “How is that a bad thing?” Some of us weren’t ment to unite and all things do crash. They want N.W.O (New World Order). All there little rituals and symbols are everywhere we look it’s called Illuminati Symbolism Look that up too.</p>
