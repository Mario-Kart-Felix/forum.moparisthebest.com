    <description>Ok here&#39;s the deal.  I&#39;m running a 317 delta and my dds spec won&#39;t work now, and it does on my backup source.  Can anyone tell me all the files involved in the spec.  I&#39;ve compared everything I can think of with notepad++&#39;s file compare plugin and everything seems to be the same in special.java and client.java.  What am I missing here?</description>
