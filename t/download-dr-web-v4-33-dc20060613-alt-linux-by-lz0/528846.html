        <p>It was about midday, and the sun was warmer, the ice turning to mush under their feet.As the sky paled to slate and the outlines of the moon Secundus began to brighten, the snow began to crackle under their feet, and the inadequacy of their clothing became clear.They searched the valley wall for a rock shelter, but failing to find one, they stopped, gathered wood, and built a fire to huddle around.Vuhon told me he had seen as much, when he was torturing me.But it wasn’t until I went there that I understood how badly my homeland had been ravaged, or how they had suffered from the Argonian invasion.<br>

Still, I had an idea.But that Skyrim had offered Solstheim as a haven for my people, after ages of enmity between our races — for that I was unprepared.I’ve always been moved by it.Morrowind had always laid theoretical claim to the place.If Skyrim hadn’t given it freely, odds are the refugees would have settled here anyway, forcing the Nords to either fight or lose face.<br>
This way they came out looking like saviors.When did the Nords ever back down from a fight with Dunmer?Your people were weakened, Sul — battered, without home or resources.You’ve too many romantic notions in your head.But sometimes, at their very best, they act for a greater good, just as some men and women do.<br>

But to return to your question, my guess is that most Dunmer settled in the South and along the coasts, and I think we’re in the interior.I tried to contact her earlier but — » «Go on,» Sul said.Then he hesitated at the cold, wondering why he needed discretion, why Sul assumed he did вЂ¦ He pulled out Coo, the mechanical bird, an exquisitely crafted object, detailed down to the feather.He opened the small latch on its belly.And there she was, AnnaГЇg, with her curly black hair and mouth curving up in a wide, happy grin.</p>
