              <p>Exactly I 1) Go to the Includes Folder in SCAR, default path C:\Program Files\SCAR203\Includes<br>
Make a New folder called ‘SRL’<br>
2) Follow the Picture Setup through Includes --&gt; SRL --&gt; and highlight all of the folders in this rar folder.</p>
<p>Press the big ‘Extract to’ button (Second from left) and select the path of the new SRL folder you just created.</p>
<p>Note: to Extract .rar files, you need Winrar.  Download it from <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm</a></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Reopen the SRL.rar archive,  but this time browse into ‘Plugins’.  Move all 4 files into the ‘Plugins’ folder in SCAR defualt path C:\Program Files\SCAR 203\Plugins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy and Paste this script into SCAR and Run it.  If the words “Successfully Compiled” and “Successfully Executed” Appear after about 2 seconds you have set SRL up correctly.  IF not, check the errors below:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I did everything that one guy said to do from the SRL folder to the Extracting includes.</p>
<p>What do i need to do for SRL[br][size=1]Posted on: August 16, 2007, 08:12:21 PM[/size][hr]well,just to let you all know this was a waste of time…i got nothing out of it, and it still has those errors. i dont know why but i may try again some other day f this</p>
