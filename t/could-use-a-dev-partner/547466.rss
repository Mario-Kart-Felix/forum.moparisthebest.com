    <title>Could use a dev partner</title>

    <description>I&#39;m currently working on a 718, taking it slow and making sure things are done correctly, 
due to taking things slow it&#39;s hard to get things done on my own, most night&#39;s i end up staying up till 6 am to finish something and then i go to sleep and go to work at 1 pm so it&#39;s really getting in the way working alone.  
You don&#39;t have to be a master programmer, just someone who can program without needing a tutorial for everything, id like to count on you to finish something that i didn&#39;t get the time to finish. 

[u]Requirement&#39;s[/u]
-You must be reliable, when you say you&#39;re going to finish something, please do, i don&#39;t wan&#39;t to come home and find out i get to continue right where i left off.
-Must be neat, i&#39;m really OCD and whenever i run into messy code i have to fix it.
-Heavy programming experience is not required but knowing what you&#39;re doing is.
-Must be trusted,  I&#39;ve put a lot of time into my work and the last thing i want is everyone having access to it or my work being sold. 
-Must not rush, if you are familiar with 718&#39;s and/or matrix the developers rushed everything and because of that it&#39;s messy..very messy.

-I will have one test for you which will be to identify a piece of code &amp; tell me what it does. 

Slightly new to programming and need to get some more experience? i will be more than happy to work with you.
Simply reply, or message me and i&#39;ll get back to you when i get time.  :cool:</description>
