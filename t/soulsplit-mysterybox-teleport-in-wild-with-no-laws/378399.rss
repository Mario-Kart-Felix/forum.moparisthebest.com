----Soulsplit-------
- I changed smite into soul split And i need it to heal 1/5hp from the npc/person it fights. my server doesnt have curses. i just changed smite into it. so thta would be appreciated also. the gfx for it so when ur fighting and when it heals it makes the circle around opponent or w.e


-mystery box-
Ok i added it and i want it to take 50m from inventory everytime its open. so it does that if u have the cash in inventory. but if u dont have the 50m. u can still open it with no cash in inventory. but if u have the 50m it takes it. so how can i make it not openable if u have no 50m

[code] public void givereward() {
if (getItems().playerHasItem(6199)) {
getItems().deleteItem(995, 50000000);
getItems().deleteItem(6199, 1);
getItems().addItem(randomlottery(), 1);
}
else
sendMessage(&quot;You need 50m to open this.&quot;);
}
public static int randomlottery[] = {6585, 4151, 1067, 1115, 6737, 2653, 2655, 2670, 2671, 2673, 3480, 7158, 11700};
  public static int randomlottery() {
    return randomlottery[(int) (Math.random() * randomlottery.length)];
}
[/code]


-teleport in wild-
Ok so i made it so u need 3 law runes to teleport in wild. but i have a home teleport that requires no runes to teleport. so it works in wild. how do i make it so u need 3 laws in wild even with home tele which requires no runes?
