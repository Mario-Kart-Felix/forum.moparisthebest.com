    <title>[Q] About Smithing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/q-about-smithing/267969</link>
    <description>I have created a new ore + bar. I have also made the ore smeltable into a bar.

I have added the bar id into Formulae.java so that I have the ability to use the bar with the anvil, etc.

When I use the bar on the anvil, I get all the options to create the item out of that bar. However, when I click the option to create a new &quot;hatchet&quot; for example, it says &quot;nothing interesting happens&quot;.

I have got the new hatchet ID in the smithingdef.xml and i&#39;ve been looking through other java files and can&#39;t seem to find how to fix it.

Any help pointing me in the right direction is muchly appreciated.

Thanks in advance ^^

After I had made the post, I had an insight to what the problem may be. I then went and took a look and I have figured out what the problem was and fixed it.
