    <title>Help me select a distro</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-select-a-distro/226600</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s my situation: I recently acquired two identical machines. 1.8ghz Intel P4, 512mb RAM, 80gb HDD. My dad gave them to me, he doesn&#39;t want them anymore.

My plan is to install an SQL server on one of them, and a webserver on the other. What I need is a recommendation of a good Linux distro to put on them, preferably something lightweight.

I&#39;d been looking at Debian, but what do you guys think?</description>

<p>I’ll check out arch though, thanks.</p>

<p>If the latter, I would totally go with Arch. Just use the normal install guide (on the wiki) and just skip any parts that relate to stuff you don’t need (anything to do with X, anything to do with a desktop environment, anything to do with fonts, eyecandy, etc). Then search for “apache” or “mysql” or whatever server stuff you want to install on the wiki; there will be plenty of info there. Such is the beauty of arch, build it from pieces, step at a time.</p>
<p>If it’s going to be a production server though, I would actually recommend against Arch for various reasons and suggest you go with Debian or something. I used to recommend CentOS, but the recent issues I’ve had with my 2 CentOS boxes… fuck that for the moment.</p>

<p>Yea… I’ve got about two weeks until school starts again, so I’ll probably go with arch, thanks.</p>
<p>Also, just wondering, because I’ve never set up Arch before, is there some sort of setup guide for a server environment? Or should I just follow their getting started guide for a desktop platform and then just install what I need to run a web server?</p>
