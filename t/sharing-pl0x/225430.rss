    <description>Look,Tbh i didn&#39;t know where to put these so i apoligise and could you move to the right section.
=============

Anyways, I have been trying so hard to make a server, spent about 8 weeks on it, then finaly realised i don&#39;t have a router.. =/

So i am looking to Co-Own with a new server, that doesn&#39;t sell admins and they are earnt &#39;cause that&#39;s realy easy.
Or if you already have a co owner, could you make a simple server, It doesnt even have to be silab And send it to me =/ 

= Thanks ,
