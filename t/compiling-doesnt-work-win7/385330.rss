              <p>I’ve had this problem too. If you have the Mod Tahorks or whatever compiler, I’ve heard it doesnt work. Try just searching others on google. But WHAT YOU NEED TO DO;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download JDK 6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check to make sure it is downloaded correctly. To check for Windows 7, go to start. On the right hand side select “Computer” go to “OS” now find “Program Files” Now find “Java” open it. It should say somthing along the lines of this; jdk-6u24-windows-x64</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So if you were to put this into the compiler, It would be 1.6.0_24<br>
The _24 is the UPDATE. Chances are you will have a different one, so replace the 24 with your version. (If you need help finding your update, repeat step 2)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have your Env. Variables set, It SHOULD work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
