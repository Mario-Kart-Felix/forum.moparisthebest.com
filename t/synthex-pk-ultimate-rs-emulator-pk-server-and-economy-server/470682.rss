[B]What makes SyntheX PK unique?[/B]
SyntheX PK is both an Economy and PK based server. The server was last known as HydraScape and is managed and owned by Danny. Every skill is working except farming and agility. These skills will be released in the near future. There is all sorts of minigames that you can try out and earn rewards from, plus a never before seen home area. Hydrascape was once the most played RSPS, with nearly 400+ people on regulary at all times throughout the day, and at night. New on SyntheX PK is an all new skilling point reward system. For each skill you train, you will gain points. You can spend these points on various items, including a mystery box. The mystery box can give out a rare item if your lucky. All in all, the server has a decent xp rate, not to quick, and not to slow. Remember the game should be a challenge, and if you just want to get those quick stats to 99, choose PK Mode!

SyntheX PK also has a wonderful staff. They are always willing to help out with updates, and are great at communicating with the community. They are fairly active and put players who need help, first.

[B]PK Mode and Adventurer Mode[/B]
When you first create an account on SyntheX PK, you are required to decide between two different modes. PK Mode is for people who love to PK. You will be able to train your combat skills at a faster rate then you would in Adventurer mode. Your skills are not recorded on the highscores. When you select Adventurer mode, you&#39;re stats will be saved to the highscores, and it is more of a challenge to train your skills. Some skills are easy, others are more difficult. The reason it is integrated like this is because it has features that both types of players like. It&#39;s better to have a server that has both modes, so the community is bigger and the wilderness is always packed.
*Fun PK area (keep items when you die).
*PK Rating system.
*Full working mage bank
*Active wilderness.


[B]The Owner:[/B]
The owners name is Danny. He knows what he&#39;s doing and almost the entire base was scripted by himself. He has a natural talent for RSPS programming and can make virtually anything and implement it into this server. He is a community-friendly administrator and listens to new ideas from players. Danny can come up with great ideas, including a never before seen minigame called Last Man Standing, which is a personal favorite to many. He isn&#39;t lazy when it comes to updating the server. He can fix bugs quickly and come out with new content on a regular basis. He isn&#39;t an owner who leeches things, although some ideas may come off of other tutorials, but all of his updates are unique and come with great quality.

The gift box can be rewarding at times. You get 1 gift every hour that you are logged in. These do give mystery boxes which you can get rare items from them. This is just a basic incentive for playing.

[IMG]http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o702/Garrett_Stoegbauer/votingrewards.gif[/img]

<p>Battle is fun minigame with great rewards. In this minigame, you have to complete 11 full waves to earn the maximum amount of points. It can be difficult if you don’t have good enough stats/armor. It is recommended to have at least 60 prayer and have a decent combat level. This game can be a good source of cash if you spend your points wisely and if you play it quite often.</p>

<p>The gift box can be rewarding at times. You get 1 gift every hour that you are logged in. These do give mystery boxes which you can get rare items from them. This is just a basic incentive for playing.</p>

<p>Voting benefits the server, and can benefit you if you do it everyday. You can buy these cool items for voting tickets. Vote once a day. Voting every day will get it to the top of the toplist, and also will increase growth of players on SyntheX PK.</p>
