<p><span class="bbcode-b">What makes SyntheX PK unique?</span><br>
SyntheX PK is both an Economy and PK based server. The server was last known as HydraScape and is managed and owned by Danny. Every skill is working except farming and agility. These skills will be released in the near future. There is all sorts of minigames that you can try out and earn rewards from, plus a never before seen home area. Hydrascape was once the most played RSPS, with nearly 400+ people on regulary at all times throughout the day, and at night. New on SyntheX PK is an all new skilling point reward system. For each skill you train, you will gain points. You can spend these points on various items, including a mystery box. The mystery box can give out a rare item if your lucky. All in all, the server has a decent xp rate, not to quick, and not to slow. Remember the game should be a challenge, and if you just want to get those quick stats to 99, choose PK Mode!</p>
<p>SyntheX PK also has a wonderful staff. They are always willing to help out with updates, and are great at communicating with the community. They are fairly active and put players who need help, first.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">PK Mode and Adventurer Mode</span><br>
When you first create an account on SyntheX PK, you are required to decide between two different modes. PK Mode is for people who love to PK. You will be able to train your combat skills at a faster rate then you would in Adventurer mode. Your skills are not recorded on the highscores. When you select Adventurer mode, you’re stats will be saved to the highscores, and it is more of a challenge to train your skills. Some skills are easy, others are more difficult. The reason it is integrated like this is because it has features that both types of players like. It’s better to have a server that has both modes, so the community is bigger and the wilderness is always packed.<br>
*Fun PK area (keep items when you die).<br>
*PK Rating system.<br>
*Full working mage bank<br>
*Active wilderness.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The Owner:</span><br>
The owners name is Danny. He knows what he’s doing and almost the entire base was scripted by himself. He has a natural talent for RSPS programming and can make virtually anything and implement it into this server. He is a community-friendly administrator and listens to new ideas from players. Danny can come up with great ideas, including a never before seen minigame called Last Man Standing, which is a personal favorite to many. He isn’t lazy when it comes to updating the server. He can fix bugs quickly and come out with new content on a regular basis. He isn’t an owner who leeches things, although some ideas may come off of other tutorials, but all of his updates are unique and come with great quality.</p>

<img src="http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o702/Garrett_Stoegbauer/location.gif" alt width="258" height="172"><br>
The unique home of SyntheX PK. All stores are located within this small city. You will find almost everything you need at this location.</p>
<p><img src="http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o702/Garrett_Stoegbauer/menu1.gif" alt width="257" height="345"><br>
The above menu has most teleports to monsters and other locations. You can go to all bosses through this tab, even basic monsters, and even to all minigames.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Money Making/Skilling</span><br>
<img src="http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o702/Garrett_Stoegbauer/moneymakingandskill.gif" alt width="526" height="349"></p>
<p>The above location is where you gain those skilling points. Skilling is one of the best ways to make money and gain some rare items if you choose to buy mystery boxes with your skill points. You can train thieving, firemaking, fishing, and woodcutting all at this location. You can buy other items such as ores, logs, bars, and other things will skilling points. Some rewards are goldsmith gauntlets, cooking gauntlets, dragon pickaxe (mines x2 the ore), and mystery boxes.</p>
<p>Skilling is one of the best ways to gain cash on SyntheX PK, if you have a high level. Other good ways to gain cash is by killing NPC’s, as drops are very rewarding. The forums have a special drop database to see which NPC drops what.</p>
<p><img src="http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o702/Garrett_Stoegbauer/acheiv.gif" alt width="255" height="344"></p>
<p>An extra way to earn cash is through the achievement tab. You complete certain tasks for a GP reward.</p>

<img src="http://i45.tinypic.com/5dpe0n.png" alt width="485" height="296"></p>
<p>Zombies is the most popular minigame here at SyntheX-PK, where waves are never ending and more and more zombies appear at the higher level you compete at. This game can take quite awhile, so once you join, plan to play it hours on end! It’s very addicting and can be a good source of cash if you spend your points wisely.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Last Man Standing</span><br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o702/Garrett_Stoegbauer/lms.gif" title="lms.gif" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o702/Garrett_Stoegbauer/lms.gif" alt width="690" height="452"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>
<p>Last Man Standing is an all out battle between you and everyone else. In this minigame you are a lone soldier fighting your way to be the last man alive. It’s basically free for all, and the rewards are the same as the one’s for battle. A quick way to get here is by typing /lms.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Battle Minigame</span><br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o702/Garrett_Stoegbauer/battle.gif" title="battle.gif" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o702/Garrett_Stoegbauer/battle.gif" alt width="690" height="454"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div><br>
<img src="http://i45.tinypic.com/219dguv.png" alt width="516" height="474"></p>
<p>Battle is fun minigame with great rewards. In this minigame, you have to complete 11 full waves to earn the maximum amount of points. It can be difficult if you don’t have good enough stats/armor. It is recommended to have at least 60 prayer and have a decent combat level. This game can be a good source of cash if you spend your points wisely and if you play it quite often.</p>
<p><img src="http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o702/Garrett_Stoegbauer/shopping.gif" alt width="528" height="343"><br>
The main place to shop if you don’t like to explore.</p>
<p><img src="http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o702/Garrett_Stoegbauer/pkmenus.gif" alt width="253" height="344"><br>
<img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/sm3uzb.png" alt width="480" height="297"><br>
These menus show your current kill/death ratio, as well as how many PK Points you have, and you can go to numerous PK’ing spots through this menu.</p>
<p><img src="http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o702/Garrett_Stoegbauer/giftbox.gif" alt width="531" height="489"></p>
<p>The gift box can be rewarding at times. You get 1 gift every hour that you are logged in. These do give mystery boxes which you can get rare items from them. This is just a basic incentive for playing.</p>
<p><img src="http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o702/Garrett_Stoegbauer/votingrewards.gif" alt width="491" height="302"></p>
<p>Voting benefits the server, and can benefit you if you do it everyday. You can buy these cool items for voting tickets. Vote once a day. Voting every day will get it to the top of the toplist, and also will increase growth of players on SyntheX PK.</p>
