    <title>Basic Neopet Arcade Cheats [SCAR Divi / 2.03]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/basic-neopet-arcade-cheats-scar-divi-2-03/100980</link>
    <description>These are just [i]basic[/i] cheats I quickly make for when I play arcade games on the Neopets site. (No I do not actually play Neopets, but I do go there to cheat when I&#39;m incredibly bored, lol.)

Most of these wont completely play the game for you. I mostly just make quick tools for arcade games that DO give me an advantage.

[b]200m Peanut Dash - AutoThrower (UPDATED 5/27/07)[/b]

This will automatically charge your peanut throw. When the power bar is full, the script will throw the peanut then terminate. So you have to run this everytime you throw the peanut.

How to setup:
Target the [i]200m Peanut Dash[/i] game window. Then, run the script. (Script will automatically activate the game window for you.)

Note: This script was made with the difficulty level set to 10 ([i]Really too hard[/i]).
Update: Added key press log - showing how many times it pressed the arrow keys (plus the peanut throw).

[code]
program PeeeNuttyDash;

//made by Dizzy
//view script instructions @
// http://www.moparisthebest.org/smf/index.php/topic,144888.0.html

var
x,y,press:integer;

begin
ActivateClient;
Wait(1500);
repeat
SendArrow(3);
press:=press+1;
Wait(50);
SendArrow(1);
press:=press+1;
Wait(50);
Until(FindColorTolerance(x, y, 255, 161, 348, 166, 356, 5))
SendArrowWait(0, 20+random(30));
Writeln(&#39;Total key presses: &#39; + IntToStr(press) + &#39; - plus 1, throw (&#39; + IntToStr(press+1) + &#39;)&#39;);
end.
[/code]

Adding more scripts soon.

Difference between bot and tool:
Tool: does not play the game for you completely; mostly just helps out with some things.
Bot: Completely plays a game for you; and if the final score is good enough, it will send the score.

[b]Currently in development (I stopped all development right now - I&#39;m too busy with other things ATM):

[ul][*]National Neopian Bank - Bot (this project has been canceled)
[*]200m Peanut Dash - Bot (planning out script)[/ul]


[b]Possible future scripts:

[ul][*]Meerca Chase - Bot (script plans canceled - I might make it still, but not anytime soon)
[*]Tug-O-War: Mega Tug Playing Tool[/ul]



~Dizzy

[b]Some of my other SCAR scripts that are in development:
 Neopets Related:

[ul][*]Tug-O-War: Mega Tug Playing Tool (Coming Soon - haven&#39;t started yet)[/ul]


 [b]Other scripts:

[ul][*]RSC - AutoFighter (currently in development)
[*]RSC - AutoThiever (development hasn&#39;t started yet; planning stages)
[*](Maybe): RSC Movement Include - Detects walking, distances, etc.. (this is only a MAYBE)[/ul]</description>
