<p>Corporations aren’t backed by the people. Only a handful (relatively speaking) own those corporations, and they operate purely for the profit of those people. In essence it’s not a bad thing, but the influence of these corporations on the government should be limited. The government should exist for the better of all, which can mean that they should give money to corporations, or take money away from them (in the form of taxes).</p>
<p>I’m not for a complete reallocation of wealth, but if the lower income groups can spend more, the economy will grow. ‘Gush up’ economics, instead of trickle down.</p>

<p>I don’t think nor agree that the items you listed are taxed because they should be limited. In the case of alcohol and tobacco, both of these substances are taxed in the UK because both of those substances have a negative affect on society, by taxing the substances the people who end up paying for the damage caused by the substances are the ones who use them.</p>

</aside>
<p>You say excise taxes are required because these products have a negative effect on society, we say they are required because they have a negative effect on society so the consumption should be limited. That’s only a slight difference.</p>
<p>Of course, a drop in alcohol and tobacco use means less income for the government, but the health risks don’t drop when someone decides to stop using those products. The odds of someone developing lung cancer who had been smoking for the past 25 years are pretty much equal to the odds of someone who has been smoking for the past 25 years and still is smoking. So if you want to make it completely fair, you should raise the insurance bill of those who have an unhealthy lifestyle, and lower that of those who have a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>I can already see the riots as a result of such a decision…</p>

<p>I just want to point out, I only use the term “free healthcare” in the sense that everyone gets free healthcare, I’ve never had to spend a penny at a hospital bar vending machines. Of course it isn’t free since it’s paid for in taxes, and I dislike the term and usually call it by what it is, national health care/service.</p>

<p>just nitpicking here, but even in america you still have your states and government telling people what’s best for you, same-sex couples for example don’t receive equal rights in many states and one of the big arguments to keep it that way is “same-sex marriage is against the institution of marriage” or in other words “it’s best for the institution of marriage that same-sex couples can’t get married, therefore they can’t get married because that’s what’s best”</p>
<p>AAAAAAAANd just to point something out, it’s not necessarily cheaper to live in the states because you pay less taxes, you have other costs such as health insurance, everything has to be paid for right?</p>
<p>and again just before I forget, something on the order of 95% of british people find the service of the nhs “fair” or better(with other options including good and excellent) with only 5% finding it “weak”, and while these figures don’t translate into for or against, regardless of what the government supposedly tells us what’s best the british people like their nhs and fight to keep it the way it is</p>

<p>The over 100% (actually 144%) figure is just some quick math, he R.I.P. RSC says that out of the .22 they pay per kwH of electricity, .13 is tax, so on .09 worth of electricity, they pay .13 tax, which actually works out to 144% tax on electricity, right?</p>

<p>In my entire life riding in a car, and my slightly over 10 years driving myself, I’ve went through 2 toll roads, one on my way to North Carolina and back, and one on my way to the grand canyon through Oklahoma, I wouldn’t call that a lot of toll roads or anything.  (I don’t know of any anywhere near me)  That’s more of a local thing where local people choose to either foot the bill for the taxes for a new road, or charge tolls.</p>
