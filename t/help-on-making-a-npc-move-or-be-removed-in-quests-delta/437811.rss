    <title>Help on making a NPC move or be removed in quests [Delta]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-on-making-a-npc-move-or-be-removed-in-quests-delta/437811</link>
    <description>Was wondering how I would either make a NPC move during a quest, such as Gurtrude&#39;s Cat Fluffs, or make one show only up to a point in a quest, then be gone afterwards. Any help on it would be greatly appreciated. I have been trying out the NPC handler.java, and though a lot of things in there I completely get and have been using, but my attempts have not been successful. :D
Could someone point me in the right direction?</description>
