    <title>Installing Car Speakers Myself</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/installing-car-speakers-myself/412195</link>
    <description>Alright so I&#39;m getting a 2001 Chevy Cavalier from my sister once I get my license in like a month. The car is technically mine (she has a new one) and we just need to switch the insurance from my dad to me and I&#39;m all set. The car runs awesome because of the way my dad took care of it (It&#39;s got over 200k miles on it now). The only problem I&#39;ve noticed is that my sister blew out the front speakers so they make that crackly sound. I was thinking about buying some new speakers and installing them myself, but I was wondering, since I&#39;ve legit never worked on a car before should I try and do this on my own and hope I don&#39;t fuck up the door panel when I take it off or should I just take the car to a shop and have them install it (if you can do that)? The car doesn&#39;t have power windows or locks so I don&#39;t need to worry about the connections on the back side of the panel I just don&#39;t want to break the plastic on the door frame. So should I try it or no?</description>

<p>i looked the size up here: <a href="http://www.sonicelectronix.com/chevrolet-cavalier-2001-car-speakers.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.sonicelectronix.com/chevrolet-cavalier-2001-car-speakers.html</a> if you havent already google or look at some youtube videos to get some better understanding about your car audio set up and stuff, so you will be fairly sure of the outcome. wish you luck. i need to find a job(which will be my first, ive never had a job :/), save up most of that income, and use only what i need, like new plug wires, wipers, im thinking brake pads, and various other things. i would like to upgrade the sound system but it would probably be best if i just waited until i buy a newer car.</p>

<p>They do pop out, but with age they do get brittle. Being a 2001, 10 year old plastic clips that have probably never been touched can break really easy.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the response and do you have any idea at how much it would cost at all? I was looking at speakers that cost around $35(are these really cheap?) so I’d have to buy 2 so that’s around $70 without tax and stuff. I just got a job but I can only keep $100 out of $300 a month (If I make that much) so I can pay for insurance on the car. I get my next check on the 31st which will probably be the check I get to use for myself. I only have like $60 right now.</p>

              <p>Since you do not know much (and this can easily be screwed up, unlike most people believe) your best bet is to take it to a shop. The plastic door frame has special clips that are made to go on, not off (sounds weird but I have a 98 cavalier sitting in my back yard atm that is waiting on the body kit arrival, put 6x9 speakers in the doors last week). The only real issue is (sometimes) the factory does not use correctly color-coded wires to the speaker, therefore not a easy task to identify positive and negative. Criss-crossing these will give you sound through the speaker, yes, but it won’t sound very good when you turn it up. Many mechanic shops can look up a wiring diagram and easily obtain this.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to get a quote and time first that they think it can be done. If you feel it is way too much for a speaker, you can try it yourself. Just be easy and remember, brute force will solve nothing in this.</p>

              <p>Alright so I’m getting a 2001 Chevy Cavalier from my sister once I get my license in like a month. The car is technically mine (she has a new one) and we just need to switch the insurance from my dad to me and I’m all set. The car runs awesome because of the way my dad took care of it (It’s got over 200k miles on it now). The only problem I’ve noticed is that my sister blew out the front speakers so they make that crackly sound. I was thinking about buying some new speakers and installing them myself, but I was wondering, since I’ve legit never worked on a car before should I try and do this on my own and hope I don’t fuck up the door panel when I take it off or should I just take the car to a shop and have them install it (if you can do that)? The car doesn’t have power windows or locks so I don’t need to worry about the connections on the back side of the panel I just don’t want to break the plastic on the door frame. So should I try it or no?</p>
