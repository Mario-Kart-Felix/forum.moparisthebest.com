<p>for some very odd reason I could connect up my original cable modem/old cisco router and get wifi/use wired connections at the 25mbps like I used to with absolutely no issue but when I go to swap to the new router/wired connection it says it’s connected under network connections but I go to a webpage and it tries to give me the bologna that the site cannot be displayed cause of connection issues or whatever.</p>
<p>Weird I know…I tested this theory with four different computers ( 2 desktops, 2 laptops…)</p>
<p>the older laptop I originally used to set up my OLD router didn’t work with N/AC…<br>
the newer laptop worked perfectly<br>
the older desktop didn’t work with N/AC(It had like Windows ME on it…)<br>
the semi newer/but still somewhat crappy desktop worked on the 2.4ghz but not the AC for some odd reason (it has vista)</p>

WHen I go to the netgear gateway 192.168.1.1. in chrome/whatever it opens the router firewall etc up. I go to do initial setup and all and it says it’s trying to find any compatible detections… but then it gives an error trying to say it can’t find any. I can’t even test the speed if I can’t get past the initial setup…as far as I know Comcast uses pppoe or something like that and it has to be dynamic(unless you buy a business static ip…)</p>

<p>analyst Marjorie has entered room</p>
<p>Marjorie: Hello Marvin, Thank you for contacting Comcast Live Chat Support. My name is Marjorie. Please give me one moment to review your information.</p>
<p>Marjorie: My pleasure to have you on this chat! I always remain committed and focused to provide you quality customer service at my fullest effort. Before anything else, I honestly hope you are doing well. Please give me a minute to check the information you provided before the chat started.</p>
<p>Marvin: 1) Does Comcast know of any 802.11ac cable modems that can be used for such a router?</p>
<p>Marjorie: Hi, Marvin. I understand that you have questions about your new Gateway device. Rest assured that I will do my best to answer all your concerns today about the device.</p>
<p>Marjorie: Please verify the make and model of your new modem so that I can check?</p>
<p>Marjorie: If your it’s wireless capable?</p>
<p>Marvin: er one second let me get the model and I will also link to best buy site where it was bought</p>
<p>Marvin: this is the router I purchased</p>
<p>Marvin: <a href="http://netgear.com/home/products/wirelessrouters/ultimate-performance/R6300.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener">http://netgear.com/home/products/wirelessrouters/ultimate-performance/R6300.aspx</a></p>
<p>Marvin: and yes it is a wireless router</p>
<p>Marvin: this is the box you would connect to the modem to create a wireless signal</p>
<p>Marjorie: THank you for this information.</p>
<p>Marvin: i currently have an older cisco i am using but I recently upgraded to a 50mbps and my current router maxes at 25mbps so I am trying to do some upgrading for the future if that makes sense</p>
<p>Marvin: I can easily get a cable modem that supplies a wireless n connection but I am hoping to find one that supplies for a wireless ac</p>
<p>Marvin: Bestbuy referred me to my isp ( you guys ) so here I am</p>
<p>Marjorie: I can see in here that you’re already using the Doc3.0 modem which is the updated one. Any routers are compatible with your device, given that it’s properly configured so that the speed that your modem will provide will sync with your router.</p>
<p>Marvin: the doc 3.0 according to the back of the box only runs up to a wireless g</p>
<p>Marvin: hence the max of 25mbps</p>
<p>Marjorie: What’s matter most is that there will be no signal strength disruption from your router. When the signal is weak, the connection becomes slow to a certain point and will drop at random times.</p>
<p>Marvin: its the particular model that is</p>
<p>Marvin: i have a 6120 or something like that the 3.0 that offers the wireless N is 6180 but like I said I’d rather get a modem that supplies ac</p>
<p>Marjorie: Have you tried connecting your computer directly to the modem and test if you can get a 50MB speed?</p>
<p>Marvin: yes wire wise I can get it, I am trying to get wireless setup ( I know how to do it so I don’t need a house call or anything )</p>
<p>Marvin: I just need isp advice on where to get a modem</p>
<p>Marjorie: Thank you for this information. So this means that your router settings needs to be configured in order to be sync with your modem data. You’ll need to contact netgear support @ 1-888-638-4327 or use this link: <a href="http://www.netgear.com/About/ContactUs.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.netgear.com/About/ContactUs.aspx</a> . You’ll just need to contact them and inform them that the speed results using direct and wireless connection have high difference.</p>
<p>Marjorie: THey will be changing some settings in your router so that you will get the actual speed your modem is giving you.</p>
<p>Marvin: I don’t think you quite understand the current doc 3.0 model of a router I have is not compatible</p>
<p>Marvin: the 6120 only goes up to 802.11g connection ( 25mb and less )</p>
<p>Marvin: As I stated I have purchased a newer router and I am trying to find out if Comcast has a newer cable modem they can suggest</p>
<p>Marjorie: I can see in here that you’re already using SB6121. Right?</p>
<p>Marvin: yes, the 6121 is the one I am referring to that is not compatible</p>
<p>Marjorie: You can use this link: <a href="http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/</a> for your modem reference. The recommended device are Doc3.0 with three stars.</p>
<p>Marvin: okay here is the link</p>
<p>Marvin: <a href="http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/device.php?tier=-1&amp;devid=67&amp;e=0&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=1&amp;s=&amp;so=&amp;sc=800" rel="nofollow noopener">http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/device.php?tier=-1&amp;devid=67&amp;e=0&amp;d2=0&amp;d3=1&amp;s=&amp;so=&amp;sc=800</a></p>
<p>Marvin: now go to this link</p>
<p>Marvin: under product overview</p>
<p>Marvin: <a href="http://moto.arrisi.com/Video-Solutions/US-EN/Solutions/Cable-Operators/Cable-Broadband/Cable-Broadband_US-EN" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moto.arrisi.com/Video-Solutions/US-EN/Solutions/Cable-Operators/Cable-Broadband/Cable-Broadband_US-EN</a></p>
<p>Marvin: It states that it only goes up to g</p>
<p>Marvin: and by the way I have already confirmed this with motorola</p>
<p>Marjorie: I am now checking the link that you provided.</p>
<p>Marvin: they even told me that this is only a g connection</p>
<p>Marvin: MOTOROLA IS HELPING OPERATORS: Deliver downstream throughput of up to 300 Mbps and upstream throughput of up to 100 Mbps</p>
<p>Marvin: an AC connection which I hope to get sometime would offer speeds up to 1300mbps</p>
<p>Marvin: this is why I am asking if comcast has an ac modem they can suggest…</p>
<p>Marjorie: Marvin, I am not very particular with modem performance,however, the mydevice link are the list of devices that are compatible with Comcast internet service.</p>
<p>Marvin: Marjorie if you cannot assist me can you please esculate my issue to the next technical level so I can speak with another representative please.</p>
