    <title>Nostalgia (still working on the name)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nostalgia-still-working-on-the-name/427870</link>
    <description>So i created this new account since i forgot the password to my last acc (beast k0).

Anyways, Im Roman and im looking for a development team to my new project. We will need about 3-7 people working with this so don&#39;t hold back you&#39;re applications please. 

[shadow=red,left]Server objectives: [/shadow]
maintain a lag-free, minimal bugs, 24/7 server while having FLAWLESS combat (PVP/PVN) and maintain a perfect Economy. I strive perfection, so when it comes to player killing (#1 way to obtain money, most likely) it must be as clean and perfect as it can get. Hyperion based server&#39;s offer this, but we wont be getting into that. economy must be balanced and maintained by all staff members, as much as possible. We dont want newcomers walking around in items which would take months to obtain in RS. Yes ofcours SOME items will be free and at ease to obtain, but Economy and smartness wise, not everyone gets what they want. 

[shadow=red,left]Topic[/shadow]: server Bugs.
BETA testers is what we need. Once our team has the basic roots to the server, we will be looking for 5-10 beta testers who will be able to log in and do their best to find glitches/bugs/problems. Thus will help us pinpoint the things needed to be fixed/worked on. While doing my best to find a cleaned, basic source to use, i came to mind that we MOST LIKELY will be using a CLEANED Project Insanity(not loading 5602+ bullshit) with all known dupes cleared out. 

[shadow=red,left]Topic[/shadow]: Pking.
So what the fuck is a server without Pking? Our team will do the best it can to make sure, no bugs/glithes will be occurring during you&#39;re pk trips. Player Killing will be a perfect experience for our players. (MORE INFO TO COME)

[shadow=red,left]Topic[/shadow]: 317 cache.
Fuck DSPK. Im sorry, but i have not yet seen a decent DSPK(602+ PI) server. No matter what, they ARE ALL THE DAMN SAME. congratulations, you changed the starter location, Home, and switched up some shops...don&#39;t release you&#39;re bullshit work or host it. Back to topic, our server will be original PI graphics(317 i suppose) mainly because, i say so.

[shadow=red,left]Topic: [/shadow]Skilling.
We WILL perfect these 15 skills given to us. Okay, i admit we might not perfect the base, but what needs to be done while training a skill, will be done. The main flaws will be fixed up. Every detail will be put into AT LEAST 5 skills (IMO) all depending on the feed back we get, we will decide which ones.

[size=14pt][u][u][u][b][b]AS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED, I HAVE ONE FAVOR TO ASK: PLEASE POST SUGGESTION/IDEAS/INTERESTS ABOUT/IN THE SERVER AS COMMENTS. tHIS WILL KEEP IT BUMPED AND MORE VIEWS ON IT. THANK YOU COME AGAIN.[/b][/b][/u][/u][/u][/size]</description>

on your pking bit is that about making custom ones or just fixing bugs that might/could happen while pking because if you add own pking place/multi pking spots will look much better<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Of cours customs would be adjusted to perfection also, but im speaking as in player killing in general. More on the fixing bugs part than the adding my own pk spots.[/quote]</p>
<p>ok well the thread looks nicely done its a well thought out thread and hope to see some pictures later on down the line</p>
