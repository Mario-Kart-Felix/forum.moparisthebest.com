    <description>First off, credits to [b]Emperor[/b] and [b]Vexia[/b].

Now, let&#39;s get started. The goal is to turn the server into a good pvp/pking based server. Although there will still be skilling, pvming, and minigames, the focus for most players will most likely be around pvp and pvm.

So far, a smallish area has been made wilderness around cammy bank. This area will be expanded as more players join, perhaps eventually made around the GE.

-Experience Rate Increased to make the server more fun
-::allquest added for every player if they want easy starter experience and don&#39;t like doing quests
-more ::to &#39;location&#39; have been added (still can&#39;t use if in combat, but these locations are helpful for players getting around)
-Pest control points needed for void lowered
-One shop added to home with starter gear. This shop has some items and more shops will be added, but I am debating making some items take a little effort to obtain. For example, regular strength pot in the store, but if you want super, you will need to buy off a player or make yourself. Another example, lobster in shop but if you want sharks you need to fish or buy.
-Starter changed to 5m and some basic supplies
-&quot;Classic&quot; Barrows added because I like it better and it&#39;s easier for pkers
-Overall drops for every npc increased (may do a little more for gwd and barrows)
-Dag kings added and drops

Any ideas for how to make it a successful pk server but still make people work, please comment. Thanks

Also, I know this isn&#39;t a recruitment section, but if you want to be a staff member when the server goes live: PM me.</description>

<p>Thank you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Most likely will buy a vps sometime this week and get this online. I’ll then make changes from there based on community input. If anyone is interested about when we go live pm me or message me on skype: thehomesmb</p>
<p>I plan on adding more teleports for pking spots in the wilderness, so you would do ‘::pk wests’ to go to wests or ‘::pk easts’ and so on. Also, most likely will change not being able to teleport in wilderness levels &gt;20 to &gt;30 since the level was changed to make cammy better. Edge homes are too common for pk servers and I am sticking by cammy bank for now.</p>
<p>EDIT: Added ava’s accumulator effects. Decided to remove regular potions and add super ones instead, eventually as more players join I may make it harder to obtain them.</p>

<p>-Added home teleport tabs. They take you to cammy bank. They will be useful when pking or pvming because you cannot use teleport commands in combat.</p>
<p>-Added a ::main command, this way new players don’t have to be a main pker, they can be pures or skillers</p>
<p>-Added a new starter</p>
<p>-Finishing up shops - Going to try the concept of giving players enough gear to start doing everything but if they want the best gear and items they will have to earn it. Example 1: Monkfish are in shops but if you want better you will have to fish it yourself or buy it from a player. Example 2: Regular Strength pots are in shops but if you want a super strength you will have to make it yourself or buy it from a player. etc etc. If people don’t like this I will have to change it, of course.</p>
<p>-Using an old domain I had - going to use smf forums</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
-Fight cave re done to only one wave. Reward will only be 1000 tokkul and you no longer get a reward if you die/leave (to prevent abuse).<br>
-Considering lowering prices for shops that sell items for tokkul<br>
