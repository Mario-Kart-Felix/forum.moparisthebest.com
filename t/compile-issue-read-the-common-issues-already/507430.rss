    <title>Compile issue (read the common issues already)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compile-issue-read-the-common-issues-already/507430</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I have a compile error which includes &quot;cannot find symbol&quot; and &quot;100 errors&quot; I know there both related but I can not see where I have mist a bracket as the compiler has only just stopped working properly, was working fine the last time I compiled. 

If anyone could take a look at the image I have attached would be much appreciated. 

NOTE: Just realized this happens on all compilers I try even ones downloaded that work for others. Problem might be in my java or     something.</description>
