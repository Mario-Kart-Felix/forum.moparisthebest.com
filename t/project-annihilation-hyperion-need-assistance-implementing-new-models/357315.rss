    <title>[Project Annihilation-Hyperion]Need assistance implementing new models</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-annihilation-hyperion-need-assistance-implementing-new-models/357315</link>
    <description>Hello, I am interested in adding new models to the Annihilation source (Based on Hyperion) and have run into trouble.

I have NO idea how to get this even started. I looked at a few guides on the models page, but Hyperion doesnt seem to be in any of them. Do I need to create a new Model Handler class or something, that loads all these .dats?
I am open to any suggestions, please let me know. 

Thank you,
 -Luke</description>
