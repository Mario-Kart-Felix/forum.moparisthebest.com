              <p>All from memory:</p>
<p>Well, first of all, various others (Including myself) posted topics pondering the idea of a community server. Lin then went ahead and posted a topic asking for a hoster at this point Davidi2 stepped forward and offered hosting. Lin was technically the “server owner” whereas Davidi2 would just be the hoster, and a staff member ingame. During the first map people didn’t really know much about MC, so there wasn’t much fighting to begin with, though as the map progressed I probably caused the first fight by telling various people to stop cutting down my fucking trees quite aggressively. Various mistakes, forest fires, and attempted terrorist attacks later the maps started changing.</p>
<p>To begin with there weren’t any plugins, no rollback tools, if you were griefed then you deal with it. This of course caused many fights, and I’ll be honest again, I probably started the first report fight as well. Grief detection relied entirely on what other people saw. Now of course we have fancy plugins which record everything, back then it was a free for all (Which was great fun).</p>
<p>After Davidi2 had hosted for a while, everyone started moaning about him hosting, so Moparisthebest took over. Various map changes occurred so on, so forth. The map with the spawn city was just crap. Just saying.</p>
<p>We eventually ended up with what you may know as World 1, the original world 1 spawn was awesome (I mean the original original, not the one near badgers castle, or near spawn city, there was another spawn before that). I built my house underground, killed various people for no reason, life was good. As it progressed it just wasn’t working due to all the arguing that was occurring. So there were a lot of changes, which upset the playerbase and distracted staff from griefing and so on. This left the map in a state and unpopulated, so W2 was made, this was a better world designed with the lessons that had been learned in W1 in mind. For the large part it worked, it was by far the more popular world. But unfortunately, the day was young still in terms of our staff team so there were still some core issues with the worlds configuration (for example, delays in the expansion of the world caused dense population throughout the entire map) so another 5000 changes later, the entire server was reset and reconfigured and you see what we have today!</p>
<p>This is the tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny version, I could write a Bibles worth on this server I’ve done so much arguing regarding it. In terms of the evolution of the forum, it went:</p>

Than that wasn’t you, sorry dude.</p>
<p>so the world David2 created and hosted was before or after the forum was split?

sounds about right</p>
<p>I think david was the first to host it, when it was still a topic, or it was a board</p>

              <p>Yeah, I remember the first thread about a Minecraft server on MSCP, that soon turned to a child board, which soon turned into this site.  I started playing about a month after the server started, I don’t know if that was the first map or not.  I remember the world Davidi2 was hosting.  It was the world with the giant box as spawn, which soon got griefed to hell so we got a new map. :3</p>
