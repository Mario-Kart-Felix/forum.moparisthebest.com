    <title>NPC changes to another NPC, and Making an object view thats in the wall</title>

    <description>Hello, I am Arham 4, and I&#39;m back
Now that I&#39;m back, I would like to ask something. How do you make an NPC change to another NPC. Also, How do I make an object be viewable that&#39;s on the wall. For example, I click Glourphe&#39;s Notes, you click it, and you see the notes thats written. When I do that, how will I add anything to the notes. If this is not possible, how can I edit the text in the Securaty Book and How do I change the look of the book?
Thanks,
Arham</description>

<p>Gahahhaah alot of that is client sided, for example clicking the notes, is client sided, as well as editing the text in the security book/look of the book (maybe text in the book, might also be server sided) What base? Npc change to another NPC? That would require adding a new void setting a npc.updateRequried boolean. Not too terribly difficult…</p>
