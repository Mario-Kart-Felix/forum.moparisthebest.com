    <title>Hi! I would like to run a RS server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hi-i-would-like-to-run-a-rs-server/76722</link>
    <description>Hello I am planing on running a RS private server went to the downloads to see what would be good tostart off with.
then i saw SPAM SPAM SPAM OH VIRUS EWW YUCK CRAP!!! 
i could not find the time of day where 1 wasn&#39;t screamed out.
So i&#39;m asking for suggestions on what to start off with hoping that the public in general can lead me in the right direction instead of a bunch of winny 7 year olds who need to go get a hug from mommy...
and if you are a 7 year old who doesn&#39;t do this this is not about you...
peace
