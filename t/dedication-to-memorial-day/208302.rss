<p>Oh c’mon?<br>

<p>If Bush had never been in office, the U.S. wouldn’t be having all the problems it has now.<br>
When we had a democrat in office, we had a surplus in our treasury, gas was about $1.43 a gallon, and the rest of the world didn’t hate us.</p>
<p>All this war crap is stupid. The only reason we should’ve been in the Middle East was to go after Bin Laden, which we did for a good year. But then Bush happened to notice Iraq, and all of it’s oil, and then uses the excuse of taking out Saddam Hussein and installing a democratic system of government in a region of the world that’s been fighting amongst itself since the beginning of history.[/quote]</p>
<p>It has also really fucked up the UKs petrol prices… it’s a fucking rip off here, goes up by so much everyday. Your petrol is cheap compared to ours. America was so greedy that it wanted more oil even though it had loads itself (Texas biatch).<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Exactly. We had no reason to be over there in the first place. The U.S. really screwed EVERYBODY over by going into Iraq. The country is so messed up. More people vote for the contestants of fucking American Idol than the number of people that participate in the presidential elections. And that’s simply cause a lot of people in this country  don’t give a rats’ ass about what is going on. Aside from the actual intelligent people that occupy it, the U.S. is a nation of idiots.</p>
<p>Go Obama =D<br>
[/quote]<br>
You should not only blame Bush for the Iraq war, there was done lots of wrong things.<br>
And $1.43 is really cheap compared to Norwegian prices, 2.6 $ for one liter, (9,841$ for one gallon) so much is the price in US now?</p>
<p>I think even have Saddam Hussein as a leader had been better than the Americans attack Iraq, then they at least have a leader.</p>

<p>If Bush had never been in office, the U.S. wouldn’t be having all the problems it has now.<br>
When we had a democrat in office, we had a surplus in our treasury, gas was about $1.43 a gallon, and the rest of the world didn’t hate us.</p>
<p>All this war crap is stupid. The only reason we should’ve been in the Middle East was to go after Bin Laden, which we did for a good year. But then Bush happened to notice Iraq, and all of it’s oil, and then uses the excuse of taking out Saddam Hussein and installing a democratic system of government in a region of the world that’s been fighting amongst itself since the beginning of history.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>It has also really fucked up the UKs petrol prices… it’s a fucking rip off here, goes up by so much everyday. Your petrol is cheap compared to ours. America was so greedy that it wanted more oil even though it had loads itself (Texas biatch).<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Exactly. We had no reason to be over there in the first place. The U.S. really screwed EVERYBODY over by going into Iraq. The country is so messed up. More people vote for the contestants of fucking American Idol than the number of people that participate in the presidential elections. And that’s simply cause a lot of people in this country  don’t give a rats’ ass about what is going on. Aside from the actual intelligent people that occupy it, the U.S. is a nation of idiots.</p>
<p>Go Obama =D</p>

<p>Please, before you start preaching this shit at least do some research. If you count the amount of civilians killed in 9/11 and then the amount killed in the <span class="bbcode-i">war</span> in iraq, you would think a whole lot differently.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Secet, post:8, topic:208302”]Actually USA went to Afghanistan first at 2001 because of the 9/11.<br>
They went to Iraq in 2003 because they thought Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons. But guess what, none were found. I’m not saying that Saddam was a good leader but I think things are even worse now, americans have been there for 5 years now.</p>
<p>So please get your facts right, you seem to respect your troopers even tho you don’t even know where they are or why they are there.</p>
<p>I cannot respect country that goes to war on other continent with some fake excuse. If they had spent that money on education, maybe you could type with computer and learn something new.<br>
I give all my respect to members of resistance movement who defend their fatherland, even if it costs their lives.</p>
<p>Many people think that war in Iraq is over, but it’s not. You never won it, and more and more soldiers will die every day until you leave Iraq.[/quote]</p>
<p>Our dear President Bush is a war criminal, he went to Iraq with hopes on capitalizing on all the oil there, but now look what’s happened. People in other countries outside of the U.S. resent us because we started all this Iraq war bullshit. In reality, it was our president’s decision, which he’s most likely going to get away with once he finally is kicked out of office in '09.</p>
<p>Al Gore rightfullly won the presidential election back in 2000, but got eternally screwed over by the Bush family. None of this war crap would’ve happened in the first place. If 9/11 did happen if Gore was in office, we’d only be in Afghanistan searching for Bin Laden, not trying to impose a different way of life on people like we are now doing in Iraq.</p>
