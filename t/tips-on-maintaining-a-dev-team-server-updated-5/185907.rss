    <title>Tips on Maintaining a DEV Team &amp; Server [Updated #: 5]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tips-on-maintaining-a-dev-team-server-updated-5/185907</link>
    <description>I made this thread so everyone could get some tips on how to maintain there servers &amp; development teams. tomorrow (04/02/08) will be the first month of the thread being alive too, so I&#39;m hoping to get a lot of feedback off of this. So please post, maybe you could post something such as &quot;happy 31-Days!&quot;(?) - Thanks soooooo much!!

Personally I consider this thread helping  :), but if you want to lock this I don&#39;t really care. I just wrote it because I got bored and decided to post some things I knew about development teams &amp; servers that would be helpful in the future.

[center][size=30pt][b]Tips on Maintaining a Dev-Team[/b][/size][/center]
[size=7pt]I noticed most people who attempt to start development teams fail. Reason is because they never help there own members out; which I call Equivalent Exchange. Things you do for your associates and things they do for you. So I will explain the basics of a development group, I will release a better series when I am done with; that may take some time or more though. Probably never… [/size]


[u][b]Appointed Arrangement: Have your everything framed for your employees[/b][/u]
Before you even make a development team these things need to have been set up already:

Server Base - What is your server based on?
Features &amp; Special Ones - Your server should have a big feature that everyone would takes place on;
Website - A place for your workers to go to in order to test there work, etc;
Server Name - What is your servers name? What does it resemble (EX: Pking, peaceful or both)?

[b][u]Make them feel appreciated: There the ones doing the same work as you- working on the same project: [/b]
I’m not Java programmer myself but I do know how to make a group cooperate properly. As they say:
“ What goes around comes around…”
When you direct, collaborate and provide for your team things they encounter become more proficient. 

[b][u]Traffic Accumulating: Make your viewers think your thread is quite (or really) good:[/b]
This may seem stupid but just about all development teams don’t survive because of the forum traffic in the [b]Server Development/Help[/b] section of this forum. This is the leading critical job for you (aka team-founder), but one of my friends who doesn’t play Runescape servers taught me this trick to getting a lot of traffic a long time ago. On top of your thread, have something like ‘I have set up a traffic system so I can get a lot of views from guests’, you may know of this if you have just clicked the link to get into here’ and whenever your away from your computer, have a auto clicker to do the job for you – its not illegal at all too, most people never think of that idea themselves. So I would recommend doing this if you’re looking forward for many more people to join your group’s society.

[u][b]Recruitment Talent Research: Your fellows are interested in top leading groups:[/b][/u]
Believe it or not, you will have to accept this tip most of the time when recruiting. If you see someone who is indeed looking forward to associating with your group then you will have to consult with them more deeply, see if they are serious for what they claim to have. Give them some testes before actually recruiting them into your group, ask for proof. Give them tests through via personal message. Time them most of all, if you don’t know what how to keep a profile on anyone your wrecked.

[u][b]Complying Term: All your rights[/b][/u]
Theres one thing most people here at Moparscape never seek out to sustain in there group: Terms of Agreement. This is the main part that should be equipped within your application. If you don’t know what to do you could use what I expect for my future development team (under construction still):

&lt;blockquote&gt;[u][b]Term of Agreement[/b][/u]
By saying yes, do you agree? That you will not cause any provoking; you will befriend with all members at “all times” even if they attempt ‘or’ start a riot with you; You will be cooperative; you will be on time for meetings &amp; arrangements when expected – depending on your application; you will complete all task given by executives’ are higher roles. If information verified by an executive’s higher ranked role wish to boot you from the team may cut off you’re existence of this group if chosen so:

Yes I agree to these terms!&lt;/blockquote&gt;


[u][b]Profiling Software’s: Keep track of what your associates do when working:[/b][/u]
I positively recommend this the most. One thing is that just about all groups don’t keep track of is there schedules’ and behaviors. There’s no such thing as a group who don’t unite with each other; and behaviors affect your group the most, that’s what rules are for. 
Here is a program you could use to schedule your project plans: Microsoft Excel:
http://spreadsheets.about.com/od/excel101/a/Excel_beg_guide.htm 

[u][b]Project Details: Have more detailings for your viewers![/b][/u]
I would suggest giving us more details about the server, what it&#39;s going to be, and what they are going to get for coding it. Maybe even telling them how it is going to be hosted. Telling them what you would need them to do, what coding you want done. Even telling them the source you are going to use. Do you have a website? Is it setup and ready to go? How far have you coded it so far? People don&#39;t like looking at posts that are people who want a team, but don&#39;t have any information. When people don&#39;t know information on project teams like this, they don&#39;t bother. - [ur=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=89888l]DePredaTe[/url]

[center][size=30pt][b]Tips on Maintaining a Server[/b][/size][/center]
[size=7pt]There are many people right now talking about making there own server &amp; saying how its going to be the best. Well for you much know this; there is no such thing as &quot;the best server&quot; because each individual server has a special con that no other one has, such as a kind community which is rarely hard to get since most people are morons - yes that is true. I bet if you posted a thread about anything someone would flame you or some guy who posted on it. But anyways like I was saying, servers have ups and downs so just because you fail to do 1 thing or 5 doesn&#39;t mean your server is going to be bad, you just have to continue to work on it.[/size]

[u][b]Raising a community: Notify your daily players![/b][/u]
Newcomers don&#39;t like it when someone isn&#39;t there to help them and they also don&#39;t like to be ignored. So just tell all your members each update that they should help newcomers &amp; reward them with a prize. Its good to have a forum and posting a picture of what they&#39;ll be getting =] - maybe have 2 version prizes like for premium(90m) and non-premium(50m). And the way it could be ran is: if they&#39;ve helped over 300 players they get mod for a month or chose to take the prize of 90m or 50m (depending on if they premium(90M) or not(50M)). This really helped a lot for newcomers &amp; you know what those newcomers do? They advertise to there friends and you get more members.

[u][b]Server Description: What to talk about? What for? How?[/b][/u]
You know, i&#39;m always going to servers each day playing them but what I commonly see is them talking about the owners &amp; elite helpers(mods) the most when i first log on. Don&#39;t talk about your team &amp; you unless it is the last thing first them to read, put the latest update on it instead THEN you &amp; the mods. There not interested in you, only the game.

              <p>I made this thread so everyone could get some tips on how to maintain there servers &amp; development teams. tomorrow (04/02/08) will be the first month of the thread being alive too, so I’m hoping to get a lot of feedback off of this. So please post, maybe you could post something such as “happy 31-Days!”(?) - Thanks soooooo much!!</p>
<p>Personally I consider this thread helping  :), but if you want to lock this I don’t really care. I just wrote it because I got bored and decided to post some things I knew about development teams &amp; servers that would be helpful in the future.</p>

<p>[center][size=30pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Tips on Maintaining a Dev-Team</span>[/size][/center]<br>
[size=7pt]I noticed most people who attempt to start development teams fail. Reason is because they never help there own members out; which I call Equivalent Exchange. Things you do for your associates and things they do for you. So I will explain the basics of a development group, I will release a better series when I am done with; that may take some time or more though. Probably never… [/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Appointed Arrangement: Have your everything framed for your employees</span></span><br>
Before you even make a development team these things need to have been set up already:</p>
<p>Server Base - What is your server based on?<br>
Features &amp; Special Ones - Your server should have a big feature that everyone would takes place on;<br>
Website - A place for your workers to go to in order to test there work, etc;<br>
Server Name - What is your servers name? What does it resemble (EX: Pking, peaceful or both)?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[u]Make them feel appreciated: There the ones doing the same work as you- working on the same project: </span><br>
I’m not Java programmer myself but I do know how to make a group cooperate properly. As they say:<br>
“ What goes around comes around…”<br>
When you direct, collaborate and provide for your team things they encounter become more proficient.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[u]Traffic Accumulating: Make your viewers think your thread is quite (or really) good:</span><br>
This may seem stupid but just about all development teams don’t survive because of the forum traffic in the <span class="bbcode-b">Server Development/Help</span> section of this forum. This is the leading critical job for you (aka team-founder), but one of my friends who doesn’t play Runescape servers taught me this trick to getting a lot of traffic a long time ago. On top of your thread, have something like ‘I have set up a traffic system so I can get a lot of views from guests’, you may know of this if you have just clicked the link to get into here’ and whenever your away from your computer, have a auto clicker to do the job for you – its not illegal at all too, most people never think of that idea themselves. So I would recommend doing this if you’re looking forward for many more people to join your group’s society.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Recruitment Talent Research: Your fellows are interested in top leading groups:</span></span><br>
Believe it or not, you will have to accept this tip most of the time when recruiting. If you see someone who is indeed looking forward to associating with your group then you will have to consult with them more deeply, see if they are serious for what they claim to have. Give them some testes before actually recruiting them into your group, ask for proof. Give them tests through via personal message. Time them most of all, if you don’t know what how to keep a profile on anyone your wrecked.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Complying Term: All your rights</span></span><br>
Theres one thing most people here at Moparscape never seek out to sustain in there group: Terms of Agreement. This is the main part that should be equipped within your application. If you don’t know what to do you could use what I expect for my future development team (under construction still):</p>
<blockquote>[u][b]Term of Agreement[/b][/u]
By saying yes, do you agree? That you will not cause any provoking; you will befriend with all members at “all times” even if they attempt ‘or’ start a riot with you; You will be cooperative; you will be on time for meetings &amp; arrangements when expected – depending on your application; you will complete all task given by executives’ are higher roles. If information verified by an executive’s higher ranked role wish to boot you from the team may cut off you’re existence of this group if chosen so:
<p>Yes I agree to these terms!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Profiling Software’s: Keep track of what your associates do when working:</span></span><br>
I positively recommend this the most. One thing is that just about all groups don’t keep track of is there schedules’ and behaviors. There’s no such thing as a group who don’t unite with each other; and behaviors affect your group the most, that’s what rules are for.<br>
Here is a program you could use to schedule your project plans: Microsoft Excel:<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Project Details: Have more detailings for your viewers!</span></span><br>
I would suggest giving us more details about the server, what it’s going to be, and what they are going to get for coding it. Maybe even telling them how it is going to be hosted. Telling them what you would need them to do, what coding you want done. Even telling them the source you are going to use. Do you have a website? Is it setup and ready to go? How far have you coded it so far? People don’t like looking at posts that are people who want a team, but don’t have any information. When people don’t know information on project teams like this, they don’t bother. - [ur=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=89888l]DePredaTe[/url]</p>

<p>[center][size=30pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Tips on Maintaining a Server</span>[/size][/center]<br>
[size=7pt]There are many people right now talking about making there own server &amp; saying how its going to be the best. Well for you much know this; there is no such thing as “the best server” because each individual server has a special con that no other one has, such as a kind community which is rarely hard to get since most people are morons - yes that is true. I bet if you posted a thread about anything someone would flame you or some guy who posted on it. But anyways like I was saying, servers have ups and downs so just because you fail to do 1 thing or 5 doesn’t mean your server is going to be bad, you just have to continue to work on it.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Raising a community: Notify your daily players!</span></span><br>
Newcomers don’t like it when someone isn’t there to help them and they also don’t like to be ignored. So just tell all your members each update that they should help newcomers &amp; reward them with a prize. Its good to have a forum and posting a picture of what they’ll be getting =] - maybe have 2 version prizes like for premium(90m) and non-premium(50m). And the way it could be ran is: if they’ve helped over 300 players they get mod for a month or chose to take the prize of 90m or 50m (depending on if they premium(90M) or not(50M)). This really helped a lot for newcomers &amp; you know what those newcomers do? They advertise to there friends and you get more members.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Server Description: What to talk about? What for? How?</span></span><br>
You know, i’m always going to servers each day playing them but what I commonly see is them talking about the owners &amp; elite helpers(mods) the most when i first log on. Don’t talk about your team &amp; you unless it is the last thing first them to read, put the latest update on it instead THEN you &amp; the mods. There not interested in you, only the game.</p>
