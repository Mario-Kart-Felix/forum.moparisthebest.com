    <description>I will pay $20 to one coder, Or split it between a couple coders If someone can make this client. There will be a few things you need to do in the client.java (Buy x) (prayer) (Skills) (Coders position) (GW)



Ok.

I want to Make the perfect client. I will pay $20 through paypal after its done to the coder\coders that finish it. Note: Will not pay $20 each coder, Will be divided. If there&#39;s a good coder that can do the following things and wants $20 here you go.


Things wanted to work with client and server:

All Working skills.
God Wars.
No custom Items. Same ID&#39;s as Jagex and Silab.
A new Position Either Position 5 or you can overwrite it with Hidden Admin Position 4. Whichever Is easy Or you can do.
Working Prayer. If possible the lvl 1-70 Prayers. All of them.
I wan&#39;t a Working Buy x. And or Buy 50
I will pick the client&#39;s Background Picture and you can flip and invert it however you need to for it to work on client.
Almost like Real rs summoning and con skill. Just try to get as close as you possibly can.
Fully Working Range and Mage. With Projectiles.
Pest Control.
And I think that&#39;s about it.. 

Email me at military_kid_2008@hotmail.com
I&#39;ll email you back my forums and we can talk there.


Would be nice if someone Would do some of this for free. But for all of it to get done I will pay.</description>
