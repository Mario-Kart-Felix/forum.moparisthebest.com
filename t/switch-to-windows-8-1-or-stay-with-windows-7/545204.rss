    <title>Switch to Windows 8.1 or stay with Windows 7</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/switch-to-windows-8-1-or-stay-with-windows-7/545204</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been reading a lot about Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 recently.

I&#39;ve been debating on weather or not to switch over to Windows 8.1 yet. I tried Windows 8 when it first came out and just had a lot of problems with it. I know now that is has been here for awhile it should be better. What do you guys think. Is it worth doing the switch?

The only thing I don&#39;t like about Windows 8.1 is the tile. I am going to download the mod to add the start menu back. So that wont be a problem. 

Give me a good reason to switch over to Windows 8.1, or give me a good reason not to.

Windows 8.1 is less resource hungry than windows 7, Windows 8.1 also handles file transfers faster, along with supports USB devices better.</description>

Can’t really confirm how well that works as I don’t have a windows 8 pc, but I know in windows 7 that there are still a good grip of programs that can’t run even in compatibility mode.</p>

<p>Exactly, I downloaded the start menu mod, and it runs exactly the same. I always hear the same complaints about windows 8 over and over, but half of them are not true anymore. I am enjoying Windows 8. I still have Windows 7 installed on a few other computers, but over-all Windows 8 isn’t bad at all.</p>

8.2 should come out in August (hopefully the beginning of the month) and it brings a ton of improvements for desktops. Like the start menu, the annoying switch between Metro and Desktop in apps will be lessened when apps can be ran in Desktop mode, and hopefully a few more.</p>

because I auto hide my taskbar and I want to see it easily by pressing the windows key, windows 8 is shit enough it doesn’t allow me to do that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
right click in metro apps opens some bizarre shit menu systems instead of doing what a fucking right click option does.<br>
Doing anything is much harder than it used to be because all of the settings are hidden and you have to specifically search for them which is stupid</p>

You can also just right click in that corner. I think it’s off screen but that’s what I did when I used windows 8 in school.<br>
There’s also <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/141702-how-to-bring-the-start-menu-and-button-back-to-windows-8" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"> these things you can do.</a> but that was a find after a quick google just now so idk if it works or what not.</p>
