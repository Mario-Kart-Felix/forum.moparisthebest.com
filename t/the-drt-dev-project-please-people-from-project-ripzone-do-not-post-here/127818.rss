Come to DRT Scape New Forums, A lot better then RipZone...We have fair Admins and will only accept people to be Admin after they have earn&#39;t trust and prove to be fair, not just say they will be. This Forum will be slightly like Mopar with our own private server/server&#39;s. You will also be able to advertise your own server whether it is Hamachi or No-IP but you have to have posted a certain amount (just so noobs don&#39;t come post their servers just to advertise but are not ever on forums.) before being allowed to do so. 

Admin/Owners are:

Dha12oks
Awesom
Ricky James

Also we are working on a DRTscape server if you&#39;d like to apply post here also here&#39;s the signup format. 

Age

will you listen to the owners
will you report all rule breakers
