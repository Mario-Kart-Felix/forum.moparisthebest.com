    <title>Community suggestions update</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/community-suggestions-update/529042</link>
    <description>You may have noticed the new board under community suggestions, all suggestions will be reviewed by the staff and a verdict reached on the ones we feel comfortable closing (including ones we feel don&#39;t need discussing anymore and arent going to be added). When a suggestion is closed the title will be edited with information about its status and usually a staff member will post with any extra information they deem relevant and then it can be moved to the resolved board. On top of that the staff process for managing suggestions, and discussing their implementation has been overhauled to allow staff more time and a clearer process for discussing suggestions. 

Members from across the community are invited to post in the suggestions board, this includes staff themselves. The process shouldn&#39;t all be private and away in boards the greater member base can&#39;t see so I specifically invite the community staff to openly post in the board with their thoughts. It&#39;s important that the staff&#39;s opinion is given along with the rest of the community so we can all work together to achieve common goals and produce a better and more effective way at achieving them. 

If you&#39;re new here, a veteran, or maybe somebody who doesn&#39;t post a lot please consider dropping into the suggestions board and giving your thoughts on suggestions you deem relevant to your scope. The idea behind this board is so we can have a broad debate about issues that members think matter and doing so in the best way involves everyone. As you can see a small number of suggestions have been moved and more will be moved and updated within the coming time.</description>

              <p>I’m glad to see this Tom good work. Let’s get these suggestions started!</p>
<p>Edit: ah so the resolved sub board are for those currently being worked. Couldn’t there be a prefix added on the topics in the regular index section for the ones that are still being “openly discussed with staff”</p>
<p>There are several threads out there but we have really no way of knowing how far into development/thought they are.</p>
<p>I also believe there should be a way for the staff to let us know the “what else do we need to know, to discuss, to consider” as well. Maybe it’s just me, but the staff can only implement what is detailed enough to implement. (unless something very minuscule.)</p>
<p>I look at it like being a content writer for a game of some kind. The staff needs to know a lot more than what is being said. You can’t develop an arcade system for example without knowing what games, how the highscores should work, and etc.</p>
