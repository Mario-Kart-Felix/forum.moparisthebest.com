<p>You are born into sin. You do not, however, bear the sin of your father or mother or brother or sister. Adam and Eve sinned against God and because of that sin, God sent his curse upon Man.

<p>that is an embryo at 5-6 weeks in, yes it may have a heartbeat, yes it may have some extremely limited brain functions but it is not a developed brain, and the language used to say “our brains are always developing” can either be interpreted as deceptive or blatantly wrong, yes, our brains may be developing in the sense that we can learn new information but they are not developing in the sense that new brain regions are being formed that are required for things like pain</p>
<p>it is the general scientific consensus that things like pain don’t develop until at LEAST 28 weeks in, and past 28 weeks is where most of the magic really happens, and you can disagree if you want but for the love of god don’t claim that embryos have brains at 6 weeks in</p>

All human brains are developing. As we speak your brain is developing and so is mine. A fetuses brain begins developing at 40 days. It may not be able to understand but it’s brain most certainly does work. At week 6 it’s heart is pumping blood and it’s brain is working.[/quote]</p>

<p>that is an embryo at 5-6 weeks in, yes it may have a heartbeat, yes it may have some extremely limited brain functions but it is not a developed brain, and the language used to say “our brains are always developing” can either be interpreted as deceptive or blatantly wrong, yes, our brains may be developing in the sense that we can learn new information but they are not developing in the sense that new brain regions are being formed that are required for things like pain</p>
<p>it is the general scientific consensus that things like pain don’t develop until at LEAST 28 weeks in, and past 28 weeks is where most of the magic really happens, and you can disagree if you want but for the love of god don’t claim that embryos have brains at 6 weeks in[/quote]<br>
i wanna bring this debate back so here goes.</p>
<p>You can bring all this scientific shit back, but it’s still murder.  Why should the baby have to be blamed for what the parents did?  Even if it was rape.  The answer to the debate of abortion is to educate teenagers about safe sex in order to not have to have an abortion.  It should be illegal and I will stand by that.</p>

Although i’m not against abortion, i’m not for it. I’m leaning more on against it though. If I were to get a girl pregnant right now, and she wanted an abortion, I wouldn’t let her. I’d try my hardest to change her mind to keep the baby. Think of when it’s born, even if you give it up for adoption, maybe because you can’t afford one, or maybe some other reason, you know you brought life into this world. Whether it’s a good life for them, or a bad one, they still had a life, and eventually one day they might have kids, and a new family would start.</p>
<p>As for the presidential debate, I wouldn’t choose either, but I think Obama’s our best choice. Even though he’s fucked up alot, I wouldn’t let Mitt Romney take over.</p>

        <p>I don’t see what’s so bad about abortion considering it’s basically human cells that will eventually form into a human being, however it’s only a clump of cells, it’s not like we’re smashing an infant’s head in, it has nothing it can contribute.  It has a chance to grow into a human but there’s no guarantee that it (or it’s mother) will survive the pregnancy anyway.</p>

<p>[quote=“Niall, post:65, topic:454137”]that is an embryo at 5-6 weeks in, yes it may have a heartbeat, yes it may have some extremely limited brain functions but it is not a developed brain, and the language used to say “our brains are always developing” can either be interpreted as deceptive or blatantly wrong, yes, our brains may be developing in the sense that we can learn new information but they are not developing in the sense that new brain regions are being formed that are required for things like pain</p>
<p>it is the general scientific consensus that things like pain don’t develop until at LEAST 28 weeks in, and past 28 weeks is where most of the magic really happens, and you can disagree if you want but for the love of god don’t claim that embryos have brains at 6 weeks in[/quote]This disregards the fact that the nature of the life is human. It has human DNA and is alive. How can its nature not be human if it is alive and has human DNA?</p>
<p>This asserts a false premise that someone is not human until he/she is fully developed.  What constitutes full development? One hour before birth or one hour after? Is there really a difference?</p>
<p>[quote=“Niall, post:42, topic:454137”]it nearly could have been me been but that’s not the point and I’m still here saying abortion SHOULD be legal</p>
<p>the general scientific consensus is that embryos don’t feel pain before the 3rd trimester, and generally countries don’t allow abortions during the 3rd trimester unless it’s a medical necessity, does meaning the embryo doesn’t feel pain make it right? hell no, but given the alternative it’s the most humane thing to do, the alternative being FORCING the mother to carry it to term to then raise it or put her through the emotional blackmail of either giving it up or keeping it, for it to probably be born into a low income household where the child may not have a good life</p>
<p>but this is of course assuming that most abortions are done around 20-24 weeks which they generally aren’t, abortions are generally done early on when there really isn’t much in the way that can be called human[/quote]This is simply begging the question. You assume it isn’t human, even though it is alive and has human DNA, and then pass judgment that it is not a person.</p>

        <p>Not trying to jump into an argument, but I just have to comment on this.</p>

A loss of one life is better than 18 years of potential suffering of 2, is it not?  Especially considering the one being lost can contribute nothing for years and will take disable another (Taking care of the child, pregnancy and birth, after effects of both, etc)
<blockquote>Since when does the value of human life depend upon how many people there are? Besides, if the number of people is the issue, maybe they should start getting rid of the sick and old.

The 'value' of a a human life defiantly depends on the current population.  A good example is the fact that there are only so many jobs available and so many that can be created due to Manual Labor requirements and those who are more intelligent.  If we have 10 million people but can only use 5, then that party clearly has no use for the extra 5 million, therefore only the most useful people will get the jobs and the rest will be unemployed.
<p>My point being that the only thing that would come of this is using even more of our limited resources and create the suffering of more people.  Everyone has the right to have children, and they also have the choice to not have them should the situation present itself.</p>
<blockquote>This disregards the fact that the nature of the life is human. It has human DNA and is alive. How can its nature not be human if it is alive and has human DNA?</blockquote>
You don't understand what's considered for a human to be alive.  If you get shot in the head, you die, correct?  But this does not mean that every single human cell in your body instantly dies with you.  They continue their functions until finally they run of whatever's require to survive (I'm no biologist).  But we still say the human is dead, despite having living cells in it's body, because they have clearly lost all brain function.  
<p>In the early stages, the baby has no brain function at all as far as I know, but rather it’s a group of cells forming into a new organism using what DNA was passed on from it’s parents.  So by the human standard, it’s not alive until it actually has a brain function, you’re only killing human cells with you do to yourself every day anyway.</p>
<blockquote>This asserts a false premise that someone is not human until he/she is fully developed.  What constitutes full development? One hour before birth or one hour after? Is there really a difference?</blockquote>
And yet, by your own logic, you're assuming that they are fully human before their body is fully developed.
<blockquote>This is simply begging the question. You assume it isn't human, even though it is alive and has human DNA, and then pass judgment that it is not a person
<p>The fetus is alive and death injures it.</p>
</blockquote><br>
I already answered this above.  And no, it doesn’t injure it as it has no sense of pain.  Even after birth, infants know nothing about general feelings and for a while, can’t tell the difference between pain and relief.  This is a brief period after birth I believe but it’s still there.

“Does the baby feel pain during an abortion?”<br>
“Most likely yes. From six weeks the baby has sensation around its face and mouth. At seven weeks the baby can feel a needle stick and draw back. Even at that time if you put a little probe or instrument in the baby’s hand it will curl up its hand around it, so it feels things.”</p>

<p>Not to mention that an abortion hurts the mother too:<br>
“Does an abortion hurt?”<br>
“Yes it hurts because dilating the cervix. or the neck of the womb, has to be done causing cramping pain. Usually medication is given to help relieve this but the patient is usually awake. A local anesthetic is injected into the cervix to numb it up. This helps some.”</p>
