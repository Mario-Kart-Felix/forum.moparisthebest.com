        <blockquote>So you'd rather kill the chance of a human life only because the mother has to "suffer" for 18 years?  Even if she does have an abortion, she will still have to live with killing another human being and the rape that caused it.  Don't you think that is much worse?  Then that means the mother has no feelings about the life that has been removed from her womb, that wonderful place that only a woman in her nature has. Countless women are psychologically harmed when they kill the child in their womb.</blockquote>
<p>So you’re saying raising children is a walk in the park?  Especially as a single mother of a rape baby?  Raising a child in the average family is absolute hell for the first while, whether it be monetary problems, depriving of sleep, worrying about the child, any alterations that may have occurred that pop up, etc.  It’s 100% dependent on the mother, so if she doesn’t think she can handle it, why should she put the child though the emotionally scarring roller coaster of adoption?</p>
<p>Although some may find it difficult, it’s their choice to keep it or not.  It’s a bit like they know what some people think about it, but they themselves would be much happier if they didn’t have to go though with it.  Like I said, the child is completely dependent on them during pregnancy, and the key rule to nature is survival of the fittest anyway.  I guess it’s also wrong when newborn animals are killed because they’re a easy and quick meal for predators?  They don’t care, they do it because they have to.</p>
<blockquote>he value of human life should not depend on the amount of people.  Children cannot work until the age of 12, according to the laws, so why would the birth of one child affect the availability of jobs?  What if that child were to grew up and start their own business, thus creating more jobs?</blockquote>
<p>I’m saying that one person leaving isn’t worth much if theirs millions of others to take their place.  You’re saying that killing one human is wrong and yet people die and people are born every day, and the population is still <a href="http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">growing by the minute.</a>  I’m not saying killing people is a good thing, but I’m saying potentially avoiding unnecessary suffering is.  According to those who are religious, the child would apparently go to a much better place than earth anyway.</p>
<blockquote>It is not a "group of cells," because after eighteen days the baby's heart is already beating, probably pumping a different blood type than the mothers.  And so on and so forth, the baby starts to develop brain function and ability to react to certain things.</blockquote>
<p>I’m no biologist, like I said, I was just going of the slight understanding of everything during pregnancy I have.</p>
<blockquote>"Does the baby feel pain during an abortion?"
"Most likely yes. From six weeks the baby has sensation around its face and mouth. At seven weeks the baby can feel a needle stick and draw back. Even at that time if you put a little probe or instrument in the baby's hand it will curl up its hand around it, so it feels things."
<p><a href="http://www.friendsoftheunborn.org/html/abortion_facts.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.friendsoftheunborn.org/html/abortion_facts.html</a></p>
<p>Not to mention that an abortion hurts the mother too:<br>
“Does an abortion hurt?”<br>
“Yes it hurts because dilating the cervix. or the neck of the womb, has to be done causing cramping pain. Usually medication is given to help relieve this but the patient is usually awake. A local anesthetic is injected into the cervix to numb it up. This helps some.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d say waiting until you’re ready both financially and emotionally and going though a couple days of cramps is much better than 18 years of emotional stress and financial trouble (not to mention when it comes time for labor).</p>

<p>bla bla bla, all I hear is why the FOETUS should and not the MOTHER as if to completely disregard the fact that women STILL DIE IN CHILDBIRTH</p>
<p>hell, on the topic of women dying in childbirth, mitt romney in the past told a woman not to abort a foetus that if carried to birth would have killed the mother, did I mention the foetus would not have survived the pregnancy regardless? this is quite fucking literally stone age barbarism due to religious beliefs and is quite literally ignoring medical science, this is not for the cause of preventing abortion to save a foetus, it is the cause of banning abortion for personal religious beliefs</p>

<p>So you’d rather kill the chance of a human life only because the mother has to “suffer” for 18 years?

Then that means the mother has no feelings about the life that has been removed from her womb, that wonderful place that only a woman in her nature has.

<p>abortion is NOT the act of KILLING a human being, it is the act of PREVENTING A FOETUS FROM DEVELOPING</p>
<p>here’s an idea though, if abortion is murder, should all the women that do not carry a foetus to term be charged with manslaughter?</p>
<p>if abortion is murder, should women who smoke or drink be charged with negligence? if abortion is murder, should we bubble wrap women for 9 months just in case any harm comes to the baby due to not being bubble wrapped?</p>

<p>It is not a “group of cells,” because after eighteen days the baby’s heart is already beating, probably pumping a different blood type than the mothers.  And so on and so forth, the baby starts to develop brain function and ability to react to certain things.</p>

</aside>
<p>“higher” brain function does NOT start until at least the 3rd trimester, abortions are generally legal UP UNTIL the 3rd trimester where the only legally recognised abortions are ones deemed medically necessarily</p>
<p>[quote=“imsuperman05, post:80, topic:454137”]“Does the baby feel pain during an abortion?”<br>
“Most likely yes. From six weeks the baby has sensation around its face and mouth. At seven weeks the baby can feel a needle stick and draw back. Even at that time if you put a little probe or instrument in the baby’s hand it will curl up its hand around it, so it feels things.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.friendsoftheunborn.org/html/abortion_facts.html%5B/quote%5D" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.friendsoftheunborn.org/html/abortion_facts.html[/quote]</a></p>
<p>except that is completely FALSE and this is why you should NOT get information from BIASED WEBSITES</p>
<p>the nerve circuitry to recognise PAIN does NOT develop until around 26 weeks, or the 3rd trimester, and even then the ability to recognise pain depends on several other factors such as conciousness</p>
<p>since you are arguing that foetuses “feel” from 6 weeks as a position against abortion, I am going to propose the argument that because foetuses do not feel PAIN  until 26 weeks we should be able to abort them, hey it’s your logic pal</p>
<p>[quote=“imsuperman05, post:80, topic:454137”]Not to mention that an abortion hurts the mother too:<br>
“Does an abortion hurt?”<br>
“Yes it hurts because dilating the cervix. or the neck of the womb, has to be done causing cramping pain. Usually medication is given to help relieve this but the patient is usually awake. A local anesthetic is injected into the cervix to numb it up. This helps some.”[/quote]</p>
<p>see, if you had taken a proper sex-ed class you would have known this already</p>
<p>here’s an idea: women don’t get abortions so atheists can eat babies, women (usually) get abortions because they cannot financially or emotionally support a baby</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would say a better option is to put the baby up for adoption, if the parents can’t handle it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>and this is coming from someone who will NEVER have to carry a foetus for 9 months, give birth to it, raise that child for at least a few weeks and then have to go through the emotional blackmail of putting it up for adoption because you cannot support it</p>
<p>this is also coming from someone who presumably was not put up for adoption</p>
<p>this is also coming from someone who presumably was born into a family that could sustain a baby and had relatively few hardships</p>
<p>but correct me if I’m wrong</p>
<p>it must be so hard being a male of the race, not having to deal with any emotional or moral issues such as “can I financially support a baby that was forced upon me and if I do not does that make me a bad human being?”</p>
