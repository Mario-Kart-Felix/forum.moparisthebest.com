    <description>I&#39;ll quote from the topic:

[quote=&quot;Tom_BETA, post:21, topic:408257&quot;]You probably won&#39;t understand my stance here, because most people who aren&#39;t staff think you keep going like a steam engine forever (which isn&#39;t true):

Moderators need motivating, it was alright when you first get promoted because you feel happy and energetic about your role, but as time goes on you just feel drained. It is an unavoidable phase, happens everywhere, even in jobs. 

Getting new staff will only slow down the phase but eventually the reality will begin to kick in, and they will be tired of it. Staff need something to work for, something that will keep them wanting to go on and do reports.

This ongoing process of gaining new staff all the time would be stopped. As for me, I do try my best to do the reports but I&#39;m starting to slow down as well now. I cannot help it!

PS most people on the server are idiots, or ban evaders. The few good ones just act like idiots. Unless you can prove me wrong?[/quote]

That pretty much covers it, while Moparisthebest is enjoying his break he&#39;s going to come back to find we&#39;ve cocked the reports system up, because no one (one or two are trying) is really giving a shot at reports anymore. I really don&#39;t blame you if you&#39;re not because I&#39;m just as unmotivated about it as well.

We&#39;ve already missed tons of reports in the past, this is really bad now, not least for the server population but also for the communities reputation. What we need to do:


[ul][li]Find new methods of keeping staff interested (Motivated so everything gets done efficiently)[/li][li]Look at removing people who obviously aren&#39;t interested in being staff (Newty for example sent me a PM when I was checking active staff saying he should be removed because he never plays now)[/li][/ul]

The current idea seems to be: Promote people, hope for the best. This system is just flawed and stupid. By the time staff are experienced they don&#39;t even care about the community anymore. It may work in a small amount of cases for forum moderation but it&#39;s obviously failing completely on the server side moderation.

If you have life issues, then that&#39;s fine, but I think deep down a lot of people just don&#39;t care enough to do the reports. I know that&#39;s the case among moparscape forum staff.
I actually took the bother to go around asking on the IRC, and asked a few staff members the same question from what I&#39;ve gathered it&#39;s a: I&#39;ve been staff a while so I will do little.

I generally want a good discussion on this subject, not just another one line reply from the man in charge, a discussion. Read: http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,509540.0.html

@board viewing: Why can&#39;t global moderators view this board? I thought globals could view everything we could, hence the word global.</description>

              <p>Yeah, I’m also limited based on my computers performance. Some staff members can keep going but in a lot of cases they require re motivating, motivation also improves the job the moderator does - honestly actually doing things like that have unlimited benefits to the community.</p>
<p>I don’t know what’s up with everyone lately, but we’ve been pretty much abandoned.</p>
<p>It would also be nice to see some member motivation going on, in the form of awards for this side of the community. I have suggested it in the past and it has been pretty much ignored. Awards would make people wanting them put effort into the posts, and potentially make useful posts, maybe even act maturely ingame? It could be a builder award or something, it would grab traffic and motivate people to make nice attractive structures which in turn is playercount++</p>
<p>Mitb, mscp have them, so why not Moparcraft?</p>

<p>I do my best to solve reports unless you (or some other staff) post that you are going to handle it. Usually the topic goes unsolved (not moved but actually is solved). I have all the motivation I could need to just log on and handle the situation. However, with the newest update, I see the lack of motivation to solve reports because the ban command is bugged. I’m also trying my best to convince my dad to get me a new 6GB RAM DDR3, 750GB-1TB Disk Drive Computer so I may participate more in the community (and other various emulation hackings and developments). I’m simply limited by hardware that actually allows me to stay motivated for long because it is frustrating.</p>
<p>Davidi2 disappeared (from this section of the websites and even before he got a job) and there’s no one to handle administration like it’s supposed to for a constantly changing server like this (and possible abuse). MITB is frequently on and as you said, he’s currently away but that doesn’t seem to be enough.</p>
<p>Is there any actual staff here besides me and Tom?</p>

<p>We’ve already missed tons of reports in the past, this is really bad now, not least for the server population but also for the communities reputation. What we need to do:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Find new methods of keeping staff interested (Motivated so everything gets done efficiently)[/li][li]Look at removing people who obviously aren’t interested in being staff (Newty for example sent me a PM when I was checking active staff saying he should be removed because he never plays now)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The current idea seems to be: Promote people, hope for the best. This system is just flawed and stupid. By the time staff are experienced they don’t even care about the community anymore. It may work in a small amount of cases for forum moderation but it’s obviously failing completely on the server side moderation.</p>
<p>If you have life issues, then that’s fine, but I think deep down a lot of people just don’t care enough to do the reports. I know that’s the case among moparscape forum staff.<br>
I actually took the bother to go around asking on the IRC, and asked a few staff members the same question from what I’ve gathered it’s a: I’ve been staff a while so I will do little.</p>
<p>I generally want a good discussion on this subject, not just another one line reply from the man in charge, a discussion. Read: <a href="http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,509540.0.html">http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,509540.0.html</a></p>
<p><span class="mention">@board</span> viewing: Why can’t global moderators view this board? I thought globals could view everything we could, hence the word global.</p>
