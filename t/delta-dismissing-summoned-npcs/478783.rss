    <title>[Delta] Dismissing Summoned Npcs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-dismissing-summoned-npcs/478783</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to make some sort of action by a player that would dismiss an npc summoned by them, but I have been unable to do so without also killing every other npc of the same ID.  For instance: if you log on to different accounts, you can infinitely spawn the barrows brothers.  My ideal solution was to make it so that if the player that summoned the npc logged out or left the hill the npc would be dismissed.
(Yes, I did look up barrows tutorials, they are spawned in via newSummonedNpc.)

Any help is appreciated, thanks.</description>

I checked all through my npchandler to see if I had any codes that linked single npcs to a single player, but to no avail. I guess I’ll go ahead and scan through some more sources &gt;_&lt;.</p>

<p>That’s horrible. Do you have “that is not your summoned NPC” warnings?</p>

              <p>I’ve looked at a number of servers, but it seems that any 317 source you come across has summoning about 0.005% complete, the best I found was a server that registered if you had an npc dropped, but they didn’t do so much as teleport to you.  I do have an old snippet that may work (which I just now realized I had not posted), but it is from either a very very old source or has been renamed.</p>
<p>[code]                 for (Player p : server.playerHandler.players)<br>
{<br>
client person = (client)p;<br>
if(p != null &amp;&amp; person != null)<br>
{<br>
if(p != null &amp;&amp; person != null)<br>
{<br>
if (person.distanceToPoint(npcs[i].absX, npcs[i].absY) &lt;= 10 &amp;&amp; person.kara == person.playerName) {<br>
if (npcs[i].npcType == 155)<br>
{</p>
<p>}<br>
} else if (person.distanceToPoint(npcs[i].absX, npcs[i].absY) &gt;= 10 &amp;&amp; person.kara == person.playerName) {<br>
if (npcs[i].npcType == 155)<br>
{<br>
newSummonedNPC(155, absX, absY-1, heightLevel, absX-1, absY-1, absX+1, absY-1, 1, server.npcHandler.GetNpcListHP(155), false, playerId);<br>
npcs[i].IsDead = true;</p>
<p>}<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p>I haven’t found in any old sources any mention of “kara” or distancetopoint, any ideas?</p>
