    <title>Man Charged $81 Billion For $26 Gas Fill-up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/man-charged-81-billion-for-26-gas-fill-up/265512</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Like most of us, Juan Zamora waited until he was near &quot;E&quot; on his fuel gauge to stop and get some gas at a station in Richland, Washington.

Like many of us, he thinks the price for fuel is too high.

And like many of us, he&#39;s forced to put it in anyway, squeezing $26 and paying for the fill-up using his debit card.

But unlike any of us, Zamora got charged a lot more than he put in when he finally got his bill.

He stared uncomprehendingly after the invoice arrived, when it said his account holder, Pay Pal, had inexplicably put the amount for his tank top-up at $81,400,836,908. In case you&#39;re not good with figures, that&#39;s more than $81 billion.

Obviously that wasn&#39;t right, so a bemused Zamora called the company to try and straighten it out. He was met with a wall of resistance from the rep on the other end of the line, who argued with him for 15 minutes in broken English that since he bought the gas, he had to pay the bill.

He hung up and eventually called a supervisor, convincing the person on the other end of the line that his &#39;94 Camaro just doesn&#39;t hold $81 billion worth of gas, even if he drives it until it&#39;s on fumes.

So how did the accident happen? It turns out a glitch caused PayPal to use the vendor&#39;s I.D. as the charge, transferring it to the billing amount instead.

To add insult to injury, they debited him $90 in overdraft charges, when his account was unable to cover the original amount.

The company has since corrected it and Zamora only has to fork over the original 26 bucks. But they say they don&#39;t have any record of his original phone call, although he has it on tape.

Either way, it will be his last conversation with anyone at PayPal. He&#39;s cancelled his account, not because of the mix-up but because of the lousy customer service.

He&#39;s taking his billions and going elsewhere, content to pay cash for his gas from now on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Oh god, that&#39;s ridiculous.</description>
