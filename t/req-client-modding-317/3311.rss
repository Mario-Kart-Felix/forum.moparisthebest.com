    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-client-modding-317/3311</link>
    <description>hey so ive been playing around with the client and seem to get it to load a new logo so i decided to load another dat file. i used the runes but now they are all white. is there anyway to chnage the color with a 
hex color like 0x000000???

also i cant find where in places the frame for the flames. i want to move them to the bottom of the screen so they dont look so gay without the stands. so im gonna keep looking for that. if you have an answer for me pls just post it.</description>
