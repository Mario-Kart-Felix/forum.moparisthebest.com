    <title>Fixing In-Game Highscores</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixing-in-game-highscores/406529</link>
    <description>I have a top In-Game Highscores when u click the scoreboard in my delta server. it says the total level of the players who are logged in and put them in order for best to worst aka: &quot;Highscores&quot; but i want to make it so it counts offline players to. so its like a in-Game, overall Highscores. I have no clue how to do this and any help would be great.

If you want the codes i got in my client.java and server.java ide be glad to supply u with &#39;em.</description>
