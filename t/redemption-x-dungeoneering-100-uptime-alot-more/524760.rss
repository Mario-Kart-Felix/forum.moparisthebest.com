Redemption-X (Red-X) has amazing features such as dungeoneering on the server, A list off only a few off the features will be listed below:

- Dungeoneering
- Fully Customized website (.net domain) 
- Fully working Slayer
- Loyalty Points
- Pest Control
- New shops area in Falador Park
- Working Summoning
- Barrows
- Fight Caves

Also why not pop into the server and train your character to fight some off the bosses? In Redemption-X we have Nex; King Black Dragon; Tormented Demons; Corporal Beast; Kalphite Queen; GodWars &amp; BarrelChest along with more!

This server is a nice 317 server where you will never be bored, There is nice and friendly staff members and the owner is trying to put even more into the amazing server that he has already made. Here at Redemption-X we also have Squeal Off Fortune where you can get a nice little reward per day as you visit our Server!

We are also looking for hard and working staff members once we reach 15 players so why not join us and give us a try? We need hard and working staff to help run the server, The staff list will be listed below and updated when somebody else receives a staff spot or gets demoted from staff.
