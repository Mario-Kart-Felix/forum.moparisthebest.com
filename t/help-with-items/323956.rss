    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-items/323956</link>
    <description>I have went through over 100 pages of threads, and there are many people wondering exactly how to add cutom made items to a easyrsc server. But no-one gives a straight answer. if someone could please post a tut on how to add an item, that would be very helpful.

I have spent hours, and hours trying to figure it out, with no luck. From what I have read, you add the sprites in the sprites.rscd file, which i did, but then im confused. people say to edit the items.rscd file, the itemsdef.xml and animations file. but what i want is a more descriptive tut on how exactly to do it. every time i decompress the items.rscd file and then re compress it, when i compile/run my client and server, the client cmd says it cannot find the file. I made them exact in server/client side. 

Also, in what file is it defined that say .spr files 1-17 are the head? or same for any item? like how does sprite 513-530 make up item 1288 cape of legends? that IS NOT in animations, items or itemdef which is what everyone says. please if anyone could help out a whole lot of people. 

also, I read in one small tut that the &lt;sprite&gt;item id&lt;/sprite&gt; means the inventory pic .spr file, but it isnt, because the iron mace uses &lt;sprite&gt;0&lt;/sprite&gt;
which 0 is the item id for iron mace, and 0.spr is a view of a head...</description>

              <p>If your client freezes it’s probbbaly because your animations are wrong, so edit those. If that isn’t the problem, then edit your itemsweildable.xml, because that could also be it if you haven’t added the item to there. If neither of those work, make sure your items.xml matches your items.rscd… that’s all the advice i can give you. Don’t expect people to go out of their way to help you though, i’ve found that is very few people here. Hopefully if my help doesn’t work, someone will come along with more advice. Goodluck man.</p>

<p>so confused right now <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>OK so I added the ites info into items.rscd, itemdef.xml and animations. it all seems to match and everything, but when i run the client it says that itsm missing like 59 sprites ranging from like 3200-4300 (not in order just random between those numbers) now every item/animation has like 17 sprites, like 17 for a cape, hich is what im trying to add. so i dont understand why its saying that im missing 59 sprites when it should be 17.<br>
if it was 17 i could change the sprites i made to match and be those and you would think it would work, but 59?? soooo confused. and angry now.</p>
<p>got my item to come up in my inventory, even when i use a command to get it, but when i try to equip it, the client freezes… help please any1</p>
