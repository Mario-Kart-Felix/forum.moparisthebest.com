<p>This book explains the use of it quite well. It also explains bitmap-based graphics as well. First 50-70 pages are for beginners, you can read over certain points you’re not sure on, or not. Just start where you want idc.</p>

<p>colors for each thing?[/quote]<br>
i dont really care what color they r just make sure they come together fine im not looking for anything massive just anything decent will do <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
but maybe a black background showing stars and planets asteroids obviously grey and ship just make it look good <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
i forgot i also need bullets for my ship to shoot maybe just like a little beam or something</p>
