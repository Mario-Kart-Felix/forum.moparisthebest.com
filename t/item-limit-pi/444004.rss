    <title>Item limit? [pi]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/item-limit-pi/444004</link>
    <description>I have no idea how to fix this in any single way lmao.

I have been trying to add new items to my server for a while now and it was coming along pretty well, until i added items over a certain ID. Items up to 20084 are fine when added to itemDef and item.cfg work fine and dandy :). when i hit 20085 is where i have a problem.

The items when wielded keep there hold emote but do not have the correct image of weilding.

eg

item 20085 - abbysal vine whip

i have the vine whip equipped
 i put on a chaotic maul the items swap fine
i click the vine whip again
the hold emote of the whip is there but it keeps the image of the chaotic maul.

I can see no way around this. In config.java (server sided) there was this

[code] 	public static final int ITEM_LIMIT = 20500;
[/code]

i have tried changing it to numerous numbers and it still has no effect.

ANY help would be appreciated, i really need this fixed lol.
