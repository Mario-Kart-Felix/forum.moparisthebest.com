    <title>Elessar, the elven warrior-prince</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/elessar-the-elven-warrior-prince/16595</link>
    <description>Gather around me, young ones, Séregon the elderly elf king said. As they neared him, Séregon began his tale about the elven warrior-price. Long ago, many moons before our time, in the forest of the ‘Golden Bird,’ there lay an elf. His name was Elessar, ‘son of nature,’ he had been named by the mighty beasts of the forest. It was on the root of his favorite tree, the ‘Aldalóme,’ he started thinking about his past. Who am I? Where did I come from? A twig broke, quickly reacting; he unslung his oak bow and fitted an arrow with almost unthinkable quickness. Drawing the shaft far back, he carefully aimed towards the sound.

It was Aeár, the ‘protector of the forest’. Aeár was a tall, silver-eyed and golden haired elf. He wore a green-colored robe, and sandals of hard wood. He had lived in the forest since childbirth, and nature had supported him. Aeár was like a father to Elessar, it was he who had found him alone in the forest, taught him how to use the bow, and how to be one with nature.

Elessar quickly slung the bow over his shoulder, and greeted Aeár. When the moon had risen, and all was dark, Elessar had decided to talk to Aeár and find out if he knew anything about his past. After thinking for a while, he told Elessar that he knew he was of noble blood, then took a silver amulet out of his robe, and passed it to him. He said, “It belonged to your father, king Finwé. I was ordered to keep it safe until I thought you were ready…”

--------------------------
Aeár explained that he used to be Elessar’s father’s best friend, and that his mother had died trying to bring him to the forest for his safety. Elessar’s mother and father had been assassinated by Súrion, Finwé’s brother, and now he ruled the kingdom. After taking over the throne, Súrion had sent his armies to find and kill Elessar. They had been searching for ten years, but had no luck in finding him. He had made life hard on the elves; he made them do his bidding.

That night, Elessar had a vision.

[b]Well now there will be a vision about a battle, then a war with the king, etcetera... I can&#39;t think of what to write right for this topic anymore so if anyone wants to finish it off, feel free. You might want to change the part after the --------.[/b]</description>
