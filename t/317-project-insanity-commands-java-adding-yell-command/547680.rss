    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-project-insanity-commands-java-adding-yell-command/547680</link>
    <description>I actually need help with more than just a yell... Like I wanted to add a donator Island.. Maybe a staff area... A really good yell command obviously... Everytime I find a command to use for anything such as yell I add it.. I always get 1 error.. I&#39;m going upload my commands.java if anyone can add at least a yell command for me I will be very grateful! 

Thanks! &lt;3

This isn’t what the help section is for…<br>
We are here to help you where you’re stuck.<br>
We are not here to do everything for you.</p>
<p>If you get errors, show us the errors along with the code either on pastebin or by putting it in code tags.<br>
And telling us more information about your server helps too.<br>

<p>I said it would be appreciated… because I’m really bad at coding like Idk why I keep getting the errors</p>
<p>Well totally off topic of what I need help with I also want to know why when ever I use deathlypvpz v3 source or hybrid pvp v3 or anything above 317 I get a lag every 5 seconds like when I’m walking you can just see me lagging same with npcs… It’s really annoying been trying fix that for months…</p>
<p>As for the error I get: <a href="http://prntscr.com/544qi1%5B/quote%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://prntscr.com/544qi1[/quote]</a></p>

Proving why we are here to <span class="bbcode-i">help</span>. You don’t know what you’re doing. If we just fix everything for you, you aren’t going to learn.</p>
<p>From what I see, you have a bunch of commands outside of the class, and all the methods…</p>
<p>Here is how <span class="bbcode-u">your</span> file is structured.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">// imports

// Class declaration (public class Commands implements PacketType { )

// Process packet method (public void processPacket(Client c, int packetType, int packetSize) { )
//  &gt;&gt; select command method based on player rights

// Owner commands method (public static void ownerCommands(Client c, String playerCommand) {)

// Admin commands method (public static void adminCommands(Client c, String playerCommand) {)

// Mod commands method (public static void moderatorCommands(Client c, String playerCommand) {)

// player commands method (public static void playerCommands(Client c, String playerCommand) {)

// test commands method (public static void testCommands(Client c, String playerCommand) {)

// End class ( } )
// a bunch of other commands that shouldn't be there.</code></pre>
