              <p>It’s not a website it’s the actual ip adress. I thought it was a website at first too :p. But start up MoparScape and then on the login screen, look at the top left corner of the login screen. Click on file. Then click on new server. Then a box will pop-up saying “enter New Ip adress” enter what ever server you want and then login with any name and pass and enjoy :). Note: Some servers are down and will say Error Connecting to Server. Must be down. Click cancel and Start Server  to make your own. But if you do that you will be by yourself. So if a server says that it’s down, you’ll have to pick a new one.</p>
