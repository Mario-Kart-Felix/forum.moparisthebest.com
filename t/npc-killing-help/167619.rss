as you can see in this horrible picture... the spider is dying when it has a portion of it&#39;s health remaining... but sometimes, it is much worse. for example, a person might go up to kill a 60 hit point monster, hit a 20+ on it and it will die in one hit! but wait, this monster should have 40 hit points left. does anyone know how to fix this minor glitch? im using pimpscape by the way.</description>
