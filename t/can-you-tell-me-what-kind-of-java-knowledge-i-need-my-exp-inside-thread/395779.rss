    <title>Can you tell me what kind of java knowledge I need? (My exp. inside thread)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-you-tell-me-what-kind-of-java-knowledge-i-need-my-exp-inside-thread/395779</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been keen on starting java, let me give you a quick background.

I did java in high school, I know the basic commands. I understand object orientation, at least the basic part. I&#39;ve coded in a few different languages. I use C, I&#39;ve not used C++. I have made java code before, I&#39;ve even made my own RS bot&#39;ing scripts in java (but they sort of sucked, though I understood it... and it was based off of someone who made the bot and I was just a scripter). 
I&#39;ve worked with enough code to understand the basics. I have no issue working with arrays, variables, two dimensions...etc. The issue of coding the idea I want is not a problem.


My only problem is where to go with terms of knowledge with respect to games like runescape. I want to understand the client, I want to be able to create my own game from scratch. Not that I&#39;m going to do this, but if I understand how to make one from scratch, I can better understand the clients. I know absolutely nothing about server to computer communications besides it involving packets? 

I&#39;m reading online how to work with java, but I&#39;m really stuck on how to proceed. Where should I focus on? What did you do, or what do you know that can help me (Ex: maybe you know some things I can do to make my knowledge greater in this area of gaming?). I do this for a hobby and it&#39;ll stay that way-- but I&#39;ve got a lot of time on my hands for the moment.
Should I get a java book? I&#39;m going through oracle tutorials... but I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll prepare me for server communications and stuff like that. But at least I&#39;ll know more of the basics.


Hope that helps, can you help point me in the right direction? Thanks :)</description>

              <p>My suggestion is to make a very basic 2d game so you can get the feel of how touchy java can be when it comes to performace in games. Try something like mario or of the sorts, and work from there until you are comfortable with ut. Then try 3d. Remember, runescape classic is 2d on everthing except with 3d maps.</p>
