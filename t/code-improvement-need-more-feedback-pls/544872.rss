    <description>
So I wrote this a while back and I was wondering if any of you guys know how to either shorten it or make it more efficient / remove dead code or whatever you can to make it better. I tried a good amount but I&#39;m stuck here.

[code=java]   /**
    * Applies Damage to Npc
    * @param npc - The Npc to remove health from.
    */
    public void appendDamage(Npc npc) {
      Item weapon = p.getEquipment().getItemForSlot(Constants.WEAPON);
      int maxDamage = 0;
      int damageChance = 0;
      int extraEffect = 0;
      if (weapon != null) {
         maxDamage = 6969;
         damageChance = 6969;
      } else {
         maxDamage = 6969;
          damageChance = 6969;
      }
      int damageDone = 6969;
      if (damageDone &lt;= 0) {
         damageDone = 0;
      }
      int skill = Constants.BURLINESS;
      int skill2 = Constants.SHORT_WEAPONS;
      if (p.getAttackStyle() == 0) {
         skill = Constants.BURLINESS;
      } else if (p.getAttackStyle() == 1) {
         skill = Constants.PRECISION;
      } else if (p.getAttackStyle() == 2) {
         skill = Constants.GUARDING;
      }
      if (weapon != null) {
         if (WeaponUtil.getWeaponSize(weapon) == Constants.LONG_WEAPON) {
            skill2 = Constants.LONG_WEAPONS;
         }
      }
      if (damageDone &gt; 0) {
         p.addExperience(skill, (double) ((damageDone * 5) * Constants.EXP_RATE));
         p.addExperience(Constants.HITPOINTS, (double) ((damageDone * 6) * Constants.EXP_RATE));
         if (weapon != null) {
            p.addExperience(skill2, (double) ((damageDone * 5) * Constants.EXP_RATE));
         }
      }

               p.getMainInterface().sendMessage(&quot;The size of your weapon allows you to deal extra damage.&quot;);
            }
         }
         if (WeaponUtil.getWeaponType(weapon) == Constants.HACKER) {

<p>there are tons of things that players and npcs have in common: update flags, position, slot, etc.</p>
<p>look at this <a href="https://github.com/lare96/asteria-2.0/blob/master/src/server/world/entity/Entity.java" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/lare96/asteria-2.0/blob/master/src/server/world/entity/Entity.java</a> everything in that class is common to both npcs and players. so instead of declaring two identical fields in the player and npc class we can do it once in the entity class</p>
<p>and then while writing code you can do this</p>
<p><code>public void action(Entity e) {
    e.forceChat("Hi everyone!");
    e.animation(new Animation(1));
    e.move(new Position(3222, 3222));
}</code></p>
<p>and the method can take either a player or npc, because both player and npc extend the Entity class! if we didn’t have an entity class we’d have to make one method for players and the exact same one for npcs.</p>
<p>this is a small example, but this is so useful for things like combat. why? because you only have to write it once! and even better it supports player vs player, player vs npc, and npc vs npc since its entity based <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

Thanks lare, i do understand what you are saying however the game im making doesnt treat npcs like runescape. Npcs dont even show up on the map there arent enough similarities to require an entity class[/quote]<br>
OHHHHH you’re making your own game? thought this was rsps, my mistake</p>

In some sense. Only props that actually work. Look at how Hyperion (i think) handles it’s entities.</p>

No that makes no sense we are saying since NPC and player have a lot of the same characteristics make a class for example named Entity put some of those similar characteristics in there and then extend it in player and NPC and for characteristics that are different put them in the class.[/quote]<br>
Oh ok sounds good I’ll do that when I finish what I’m doing</p>

<p>No offence but it looks like you came into your game with no design and this kind of thing can happen. The beauty about object-orientation is for example you can use abstraction for an npc and player because since an npc and a player have so much similar characteristics you can just put it in one file and just extend or implement it in the player and npc file. If you don’t do this your going to end up re-writing code over and over which is just redundant.</p>

<p>Well yeah, it is from scratch and I was having a hell of a tough time getting the basics of a game down. I have a Player.java and an Npc.java but the problem is in my game the Player and Npc are two totally different things.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with implicit casting it’s when you start using a lot of explicit casting it can get bad. Also, are you using a P.I?

<p>Trust me when you re-write combat and it’s entity based you want to know polymorphism it saves you from using instanceof and casting all the time it also just keeps your code short and neat.</p>

<p>by oop they mean assigning these functions to the object</p>

<p>…but it is like that…</p>

</aside>
<p>p.attackPlayer instead of attackPlayer()</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>it seems like a lot of the code is written within the player file so i’d move them out<br>
[/quote]<br>
It’s not you derp. It may be proper OOP heres an example:</p>
<p>[code=java]public class Test {<br>
private Player player;</p>
<pre><code>public Test(Player player) {
    this.player = player;
}

public void test() {
    player.doSomething();
}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>Notice that he’s using an object to reference the player.</p>
<p>OT: Okay you have a general idea on objects sure but OOP is not about having a different classes. Languages that are not OOP can have different files to hold code.</p>
<p>Look at the headfirst book on OOP. It’s good for beginners.[/quote]<br>
That example you gave is how I normally do it.</p>
