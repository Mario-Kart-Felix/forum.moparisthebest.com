              <p>ok for the well thing, go to your client.java and press ctrl-f and type this <code>makeglobalobj</code> then once theres a huge list above it or below it it should say like <code>deletethatobject</code> something like that well u just copy and paste one of them then type ::noclip on ur server walk on the well type ::mypos for the coordinates then re-type the coords on the thing u copy + pasted juss change the cords to what u got by the well and boom compile restart its gone.</p>
<p>Here i’ll get the exact deleteobject code for you with the right coords.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">deletethatobject(3085, 3502);</code></pre>
<p>that should be the correct one, so just look for your delete that object thing and put at the bottom of the delete list <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>and don’t think this as it will work but i might have a command for your pray problem idk if it will work, it was just in my files, try copying this code near ur command codes.</p>
<p><code>if(command.startsWith("prayer") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 0){
sM("Attack: "+AtkPray+"");
sM("Strength: "+StrPrayer+"");
sM("Defence: "+DefPray+"");
sM("Range: "+RangePray+"");
sM("Magic: "+MagePray+"");
}</code></p>
<p>k thats not code i swear this is the real real code im 99.9% sure it is its so that the pray altar will charge points.</p>
<p><code>if(objectID == 10638 || objectID == 409 || objectID == 411 || objectID == 4859){
        if(playerLevel[5] == getLevelForXP(playerXP[5])) {
            sM("You already have full Prayer points.");
        } else {
	    setAnimation(645);
            playerLevel[5] = getLevelForXP(playerXP[5]);
            sendFrame126("Prayer: "+playerLevel[5]+"/"+getLevelForXP(playerXP[5])+"", 687);
            sendFrame126("" + getLevelForXP(playerXP[5]) + "", 4013);
            sendFrame126("" + playerLevel[5] + "", 4012);
            sM("You recharge your Prayer points.");
        }  
}</code></p>
