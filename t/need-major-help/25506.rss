    <description>Whenever I try to log into my server it says that I am already logged in and that it wants me to try again. I do that and it says the same thing. I decided to look into the character file to see if the problem was there. Two files popped up &quot;Twilight (which is me)&quot; and &quot;_.&quot; I&#39;ve never seen &quot;_&quot; before so I opened it up to look at it and it had the exact same information as &quot;Twilight&quot; (except for player rights.) So I deleted it and tried to log in again. This time it took a little longer but ended up saying error connecting to server. I tried once more and it said I was logged in still. I went back to characters and &quot;_&quot; popped up again, even tho I didn&#39;t try to log in with that. What&#39;s the problem!? Please help!</description>

              <p>“_” is a unnamed account, meaning that when you tried to log in, you logged in and out so fast it couldn’t reconize your name</p>
<p>I had the same problem… I dont know how to fix it, so i just made a new account</p>
