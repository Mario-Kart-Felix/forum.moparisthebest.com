    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sacks-no-idea-why/455855</link>
    <description>Ok so i just added a armour called Ganodermic and when i spawn it say i spawned two of the bodies they would stack up on top of each other. How do i fix this so they don&#39;t stack up. I think it could be client sided not to sure. It has a little 1 next to the item in the invo. Thanks guys hope you can help me.</description>
