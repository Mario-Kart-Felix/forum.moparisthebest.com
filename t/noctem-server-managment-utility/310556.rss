    <title>Noctem - Server Managment Utility</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/noctem-server-managment-utility/310556</link>
    <description>Hello, and welcome to my development of my Server management Utility called Noctem. Now when It&#39;s done, it will hopefully be the only utility you will need to edit your server. My goal is to first create a server base that will unify all of MoparScape, and this will be the only tool you need. It will allow you to edit almost every aspect of the server. The only restrictions will be the core classes. Right now, I just need some Ideas of some features to add. This is what I have right now:
