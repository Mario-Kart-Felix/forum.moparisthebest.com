    <description>hello, im using a server thats compatible with pwnscape v3 client. however i followed a guide to make a web client. Im was having some problems. firstly the ip address the jar is connecting to is always localhost even though in the gui.java its the correct one. secondly alot of buttons were missing in the jar version (like music, emotes buttons etc). Can anyone help me? is there like a guide for this type of server specifically or something? Is there another client that works with the pwnscape v3 server? ty</description>
