The error <span class="bbcode-b">error_game_js5io</span> is thrown because there was a problem connecting to the update server (this is if I’m remembering correctly - its been a while - so check the client). This means you have inputted an invalid address or the update server itself is causing the problem. Try double-checking the address for validity, or if the problem persists within the update server: check the source code yourself or contact the owner and explain the problem.<br>

You’re correct, and it also means that if you’re running it yourself, you must run the server before the client.[/quote]Which is what I said. That means there is a problem with connectivity with the update server, so that ‘also’ was not needed, as it was already implied within my post. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Read the sticky next time ok? You need to tell us other facts other than ‘running doesn’t work’ since if it is just that, we’d be saying ‘wut yur jdk’ and shit. Here is a list of things you can tell us to help you in the problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>What client are you using (some clients import a cache from another website but the requested url may be down)</li>
<li>Do you have your latest java updated?</li>
<li>What jdk version do you currently have</li>
<li>What does your run.bat have in it (some of you refer this as ‘code’ or w-e)</li>
<li>Did you set your classpaths?</li>
<li>Pictures could help</li>
<li>Were it is located in your files<br>
ect ect</li>
