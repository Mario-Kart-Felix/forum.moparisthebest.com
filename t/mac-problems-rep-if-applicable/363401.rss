    <title>Mac problems. Rep++ if applicable</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mac-problems-rep-if-applicable/363401</link>
    <description>Hey,

I just decided to have a little look on a private server via webclient. It downloaded the cache, and then came up with that black screen saying &quot;Sorry, an error has occurred whilst running runescape, please try one of the following...&quot;

I then downloaded the client and had the same problem.

Any suggestions?

Thanks

              <p>Okay thanks, that makes sence. Is it just worth running it in windows rather than on my macOS?</p>
<p>Files like “nullmainfilecache.dat” were downloaded to the folder that the .jar file is in…? Are there more cache’s that are downloaded?</p>
