    <description>Hybridscape.coms plans:

Forum (possibly just a link on moparisthebest.com for its own catagory) - i say this because this server is going to be very different from the rest on moparisthebest.com, so it wouldnt make sense to mix it into the jungle.

Php server control - sense the game servers will be all connecting to the one login server, as well as having their own sql tables.  it would make sense for them to be able to edit some of the stuff stored in the sql tables, such as characters of their servers admins and what not.  dosn&#39;t need to be too fancy :p

Online javadocs - speaks for itself.

Packet listing - sorta like rscds packet listing, i know i found this very useful when im working with the rsc server so maybe it would be useful to those working with the rs2 server.

Simple Serverlist which only shows online Hybridscape servers, and webclient that will work with the serverlist.  Webclient will connect to where the game server is hosted to get the cache rather than hybridscape.com.  this should save a great deal on bandwidth as well as allow the user to make cache modifications, if we do ever finish that tool.</description>
