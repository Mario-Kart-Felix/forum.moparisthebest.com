    <description>What were in your opinion the jumps in private servers that you saw in 2012? See something good? See something bad?

I thought the release of 2012 was Apollo for sure. I hope this next year we see something top it and we move towards better content development.</description>

In my honest opinion i don’t think PI will really die out anytime soon, the reason for this is that a lot of people are making profit by downloading a totally leeched project insanity based source from the downloads section and then changing a few basic things around then once that is done all they merely do is host it, buy a highly noticeable advertisement spot on sites like google and moparscape and just feast on the profits.</p>
<p>So i conclude that PI based servers won’t really die anytime soon, in my opinion if we wanted to stop people from using Pi based servers we would make a rule and have a couple of moderators strip the downloads and tutorials section of the forums to delete anything that is related to project insanity except for a cleaned version of it.<br>

We aren’t allowed to do this though.[/quote]<br>
Yeah I know that’s why we should refrain should posting anymore pi’s in the downloads section.</p>

You can thank the same old people for that. I feel bad someone that is here to learn and experience the era of private servers, rather than someone that creates an account to fix one problem that is usually simple and to the point. It seems that the community itself doesn’t know how to label these new members.</p>

This is true, I was also referring to both design and development. 90% of the members here are working with PI and don’t care about the design.</p>

              <p>cause everyone here sucks shit (including me), and the people that don’t suck don’t give a fu<span class="bbcode-s"></span>ck anymore</p>
<p>I mean the only <span class="bbcode-b">relatively active</span> people that can design a good server and know good design patterns are like sini, Lin, and David lol.</p>
<p>Anyone who I didn’t mention just isn’t active or has lost interest in rsps and doesn’t seem to care anymore. Plus, half the people that come through here, and even some active members on here don’t care about ‘design’ nor have any desire to learn about it.</p>
<p>I’m getting off topic I know, and I hate to say it but this community is beginning to bore me. I’m not really learning anything new here like I used too, and its a shame to say that I now learn more at Rune-Server than I do here (although I really do hate the type of people over there). Idk, what I’m saying right now might piss people off but its just how I feel.</p>
<p>I know I just completely derailed this topic but what do you guys think?</p>

<p>A cleaned and enhanced PI is better then the shit servers that come out of it yes, but it’s still far from fine.</p>
<p>I’d agree with the Apollo release, or maybe the full 530 HD client? That’s going to cause a lot more 530’s around.</p>

<p>It’s not that hard holding over 100 players and sure, if you want a successful base you need a balance of both but the focus on faster, and faster needs to stop. I could talk about ways to create a parallel model to update players?</p>

<p>idk, ive improved a lot in 2012. I went from barely knowing what enums were, to now learning about NIO. hopefully I can design my own framework by the end of 2013 :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Evelus died when I had a freak out since the work load was too great to handle alone. I’m doing a framework project now that’s been in development for the past month and a halfish. I’m more active because of break <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Thanks, also if you would like to state how you have improved (with RSPS) that would be awesome.</p>
<p>Haha, oh wow. How have I improved. Well, I look back at previous work, and I think “Wow some of this is good” and then sometimes I think “My god this is awful what was I thinking”. I got Java Guru in 2012, so, awesome year but I think I’m not very deserving of it until recently. I need to improve my design skills in 2013 and master design patterns. Learning the basic design patterns made my programs way more flexible, I suggest reading up on them if you are interesting in improving your skills.</p>
<p>I hope to release a major framework this year that is mentioned at the start of next year, that is one of my minor resolutions haha.</p>
<p>This year was disappointing. No major jumps forward really now that I think of it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
