    <title>Developing a Client Based Mini-OS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/developing-a-client-based-mini-os/356547</link>
    <description>If that title makes any sense. I&#39;m looking into programming a Client Based mini operating system. Basically what I mean by that is that I am going to develop my own GUI for a program that would ACT like an operating system. In no way really would it be an operating system, Just more of an Ease of Access program. And I&#39;m not sure if it is in the right section. Should this be in a help section or development team section? Please move if so.

I am in need of a few extra people to help. I need a graphic designer. Somebody who can create background images and graphics for wallpapers, Pictures, Logo&#39;s, etc...

If anybody could help me out? The more experienced you are the better. And if you could post a few pictures of other graphics you have previously made, that would help me pick who I would like to help me.

Now I know that I may seem pretty stupid posting this, I do not have any payment to trade for work. I can only offer credits in the project.
Again, Anybody willing to help would be greatly appreciated.

- Austin(Tino)

*EDIT* I just read the rules. I do not have my current work up on this post because I kind of want the project GUI and looks to be a surprise.

EDIT* To keep this Topic maintained. I will post 3 Program icons that I developed earlier this week. They were all custom made by me,  I kept the names original. Text Editor(TE), Internet Viewer(IV). Just because if they were other names people might get confused with new program names since they are unheard of. Of course There will be an option to change the names, add different programs. Change the icons. ETC. This project will not be done for months. I assure you this. Maybe years. And it won&#39;t even be a real operating system. Just a client program.

<p>I posted development David. You aren’t even in the argument. So why do you care? And as for n10si t.<br>
I am looking for a graphic designer because I can’t do the work that I required. I am not skilled enough. So stop acting like you know the answer, because you obviously don’t. Right from those 2 words, your as bad as Vain. You don’t like to read the context clues.</p>
<p>[quote=“Si Force, post:13, topic:356547”]From what I’ve seen on this thread is that you’ve stated that you are programming a Client based mini-os, but what you are asking for is people to design the graphics, which to my understanding has nothing to do with the “General Programming” section at all.</p>
<p>Unless you can provide some evidence that this has something to do with programming and not just hiring graphics people, I’ll have to move this over to mitb.</p>

<p>Thanks for the back up. And VAIN does need to read. He obviously hasn’t gotten to the part where Context clues come into play. I think that’s for the big boys in 4th grade.</p>

<p>You can request one there. Secondly, as this is just asking for a graphics designer, and no code/progress has been posted, it should be removed until you get the time to show some development. Until that time, I suggest you post your request in the General Section and MITB Graphics Section.</p>

              <p>If that title makes any sense. I’m looking into programming a Client Based mini operating system. Basically what I mean by that is that I am going to develop my own GUI for a program that would ACT like an operating system. In no way really would it be an operating system, Just more of an Ease of Access program. And I’m not sure if it is in the right section. Should this be in a help section or development team section? Please move if so.</p>
<p>I am in need of a few extra people to help. I need a graphic designer. Somebody who can create background images and graphics for wallpapers, Pictures, Logo’s, etc…</p>
<p>If anybody could help me out? The more experienced you are the better. And if you could post a few pictures of other graphics you have previously made, that would help me pick who I would like to help me.</p>
<p>Now I know that I may seem pretty stupid posting this, I do not have any payment to trade for work. I can only offer credits in the project.<br>
Again, Anybody willing to help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Austin(Tino)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>EDIT</em> I just read the rules. I do not have my current work up on this post because I kind of want the project GUI and looks to be a surprise.</p>
<p>EDIT* To keep this Topic maintained. I will post 3 Program icons that I developed earlier this week. They were all custom made by me,  I kept the names original. Text Editor(TE), Internet Viewer(IV). Just because if they were other names people might get confused with new program names since they are unheard of. Of course There will be an option to change the names, add different programs. Change the icons. ETC. This project will not be done for months. I assure you this. Maybe years. And it won’t even be a real operating system. Just a client program.</p>
