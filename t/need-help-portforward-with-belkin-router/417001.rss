Then comes the no-ip... I&#39;ve made the host as &quot;jalix.no-ip.org&quot;

*My IPV4 IS STATIC!*

I&#39;ve also went to, [url=http://www.canyouseeme.org]www.canyouseeme.org[/url] i&#39;ve checked the port &quot;43594&quot; and the error i&#39;m establishing is: Connection timed out

              <p>The first thing I would think of is that your ip wasn’t static, but you said you did that. IF it actually is static then did you check to make sure that your static ip is also set to 192.168.2.5 I remember back when i first made a private server that was my problem. I had my ip in the router set to 192.168.0.11 instead of 192.168.0.10. The only other thing I can think of is that where it says TCP if your router has the option of “Both” or TCP/UDP change it to that. Otherwise just create a second one is possible.    (RSPS1 43594-43594 UDP 192.168.2.5 43594-43594)    If this still doesn’t remedy the problem I’m not sure what the problem is… You could try from the beginning, and If you haven’t tried using this site for tutorials before it worked well for me <a href="http://portforward.com" rel="nofollow noopener">portforward.com</a> Sorry if this doesn’t help your problem. If it’s not something with your static ip, then I’m not sure why the port would be closed it looks like you forwarded correctly, but I don’t have a Belkin so I’m not entirely sure.</p>
