    <title>Webclient problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-problem/399651</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I have been working on making my webclient today. I did all the steps, jarred/signed it and all that shit. Then made an HTML file to run the actual webclient. When I run the html file from my computer the webclient loads fine in my browser.

So I then uploaded all my files to my web host including the cache and shit. But when I go to the actual webclient on the webpage it starts loading and then stays at a white screen.

Heres the link to my webclient: http://www.vintagepk.net/play.html (If that&#39;s considered advertising I&#39;m sorry)

Anyone know what could be causing this problem?</description>
