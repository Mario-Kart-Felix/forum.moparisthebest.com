    <title>Webclient Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-problem/432966</link>
    <description>Hello,

Recently I have made my own Project Insanity webclient, I have an auto-extracting cache which is ZIPPED correctly. Now, I have made it a .jar file and it opens perfectly in my desktop (downloaded version) but when I try and put it into a HTML and put it on a website it just get stuck on &quot;Requesting Title Screen&quot;.

Now, I don&#39;t know why it does this as it works on my computer as a .jar file when I open it. Please could you help me out!

Thanks, 

Zudore.</description>
