    <description>hey guys, im using CautionX&#39;s source and client [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=514473.0]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=514473.0[/url]

 the crowns on ::yell background is black, ive tried replaceing the crowns in the cache, but they arnt loading? and i cant find 2 crowns in the cache, client and i even checked in the source :L
ive used 3 different caches, and 5 different ::yell commands... nothing works so i know the problem is in the client files as i use the source on another client and the crowns are fine.. i think it could be uploaded VIA. a cache editor?... The cache editor i tryed just froze... i tried it atleast 10 times, (toms cache editor).
