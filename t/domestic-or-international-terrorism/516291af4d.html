        <p>A girl who visited their home for years said that within the last couple years, their whole family started acting different (they started wearing different types of clothes &amp; her mom talked about the government being behind disasters such as 9-11).  She also stated that their family was never really that religious, but within the last few years started to get into it.  That was on CNN, so it’s probably wrong anyway.</p>

But why does we care so much about this incident? People die everyday.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Ah yes, the old “bad things happen every day, therefor nobody should care” argument. The population of boston is ~625,000. This guy caused almost the entire city to stay indoors for a whole day; schools were closed, people didn’t go to work, the whole thing. His brother shot and killed a cop at the MIT campus (but wait, american cops=pigs to you, why should you care?), and then had almost the entire Boston police force searching for this guy. He was by all means a terrorist, and it’s not entirely often that America has a terrorist attack on it’s own land. Nobody’s lessening the fact that people die every day, because everyone knows people die every day, but this is more than just “people dying”.[/quote]<br>
Do people know how many people the Obama administration kills through the drug laws? No, so stop reporting too much on this, and educate people about the real dangers.</p>
