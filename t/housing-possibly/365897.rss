    <title>Housing Possibly?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/housing-possibly/365897</link>
    <description>I was wondering, as i walked through plague city, i saw all the empty little pathetic houses. they are crappy but yet, kind of cool. me and my friend thought up and idea that possibly we could develop this city into a kinda of gathering spot by selling houses. i know for sure the bare minimum i would need for this project would be

1. getting all doors working (i can do this no problem)
2. creating a command that when typed in takes you to Your House, so itd be diffrent for each player, but still the same command.
3. create a ranking type system that can assign automatically and save into your char file what number house you have. also it can recognize this and send it to the command and let it take you to your right house
4. possibly a way to sell houses...like a shop that sells the houses and then assigns that house to that player.

this is only an idea. please do not flame, i think it is a good idea though :D</description>

It explains everything that is needed. I’m not giving you any code you can do that yourself.</p>
<p>For number 1; When making the doors work make sure that only the player that owns the house can open the door unless the player puts his house on public (so others can come in)</p>
<p>For number 2; Make the player have a specific ID. This ID will link to a house then… When a player uses the command it will go to right house.</p>
<p>For number 3; This is exactly the thing I was talking about for number 2. An ID that links the player to a house.</p>
<p>For number 4; When a player buys a house, assign them the ID of the house they just brought… This ID will be used on the doors (to see if the player owns the house and allow them to open the door) and the command (teleport the player to the right house).</p>

              <p>I was wondering, as i walked through plague city, i saw all the empty little pathetic houses. they are crappy but yet, kind of cool. me and my friend thought up and idea that possibly we could develop this city into a kinda of gathering spot by selling houses. i know for sure the bare minimum i would need for this project would be</p>

<li>getting all doors working (i can do this no problem)</li>

<p>this is only an idea. please do not flame, i think it is a good idea though <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
