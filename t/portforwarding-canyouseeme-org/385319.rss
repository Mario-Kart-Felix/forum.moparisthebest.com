    <title>Portforwarding | CanYouSeeMe.org</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-canyouseeme-org/385319</link>
    <description>Ok so, I have a server and I have made loads before but I had help from people and yes they spoon fed me but I tried my best to learn, I have tried to portforward and I am sure it is done right but I am not sure, my friends can&#39;t connect to the server when it is online, the IP&#39;s are all right but for some reason they can&#39;t connect, it says that they can&#39;t connect. Can you help me please? I have teamviewer aswell.

CanYouSeeMe.org: I use this and check the ports I use for the server, they should be on 43594 or 43595 or 55555 but it says error connection timed out or something, someone please help me.

P.S I use uTorrent aswell.</description>
