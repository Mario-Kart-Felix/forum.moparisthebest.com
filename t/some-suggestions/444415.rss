    <description>[quote=&quot;The Wanderer, post:1, topic:435081&quot;]I am constantly browsing mopar on my phone and it annoys me that I cannot report posts with the mobile theme. Yes I switch to another theme to report a post, but that would defeat the purpose of having a mobile theme, wouldn&#39;t it? So yeah, would be a major plus if you could add that.

And the ability to vote on polls and add support for viewing list bbc.[/quote]
Suggested that a while ago and it didn&#39;t really get that much attention imo.  :(

I also feel that we should get more activity on the wiki. I&#39;m going to document a lot of the packets for 377 and any 317 packets that aren&#39;t documented right now, but I noticed that hardly anyone makes some contributions. Maybe if you added a badge for a member who has made a lot of contributions to the wiki, it would give an incentive for other users to contribute more.</description>

              <p>Well. I am going to keep this open (rather unorthodox, but either way) for now. We may not reply in it anytime soon, but I do want to investigate the idea further once we have the means and time to. We’re rather busy with other stuff right now, so there’s only so much we can do about the wiki (it tends to be on the back burner, unfortunately).</p>

              <p>I wouldn’t want it in the post user signature, I’d probably just want it somewhere in the main profile. I do not support board redirections to the wiki, I think it will cause too much clutter.</p>
<p>As for the mobile theme, that’s something that MITB realizes is an issue and just hasn’t gotten around to (or doesn’t know how to) fix.</p>

<p>It’s possible, but would require another modification and wiki integration (not sure how much/if at all the wiki is integrated). I can somewhat not proudly say I haven’t spent any time on the wiki. I think it’s a fantastic idea, though. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> And, in order to reduce clutter, it would only show up if the user has &gt; 0 contributions.</p>

<p>Couldn’t stress that more. Surely there is a plugin or something of the sort for wikis that would like to allow editing of pages through a more graphical way? Even a drag and drop interface would be better than what it is right now.</p>
<p>I can’t think of any more ways to advertise it other than the badge or what you guys have done already (announcements and tab). Only other incentive I could think of would be money, but I highly doubt MITB would want to pay users to create pages for the wiki (I also think that would kind of ruin it, since the wiki is made for people to share information, not make money). Anyone else think of anything?</p>

<p>Maybe have a redirect board as a child to server help section? That would surely get more people looking at and perhaps more people contributing. My only worry with that would be people creating useless pages asking for help, although I’m not sure if it would even be that large of deal.</p>

              <p>I agree with you on the mobile theme. It does need updating with certain features if it’s possible.

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/wiki">@wiki</a> badge, I don’t particularly know if I like this one. While I wouldn’t be against a badge like ‘Top Wiki Contributer’ or something of the likes, a badge for just contributing anything doesn’t appeal to me. Also there’s not really much more we can do to advertise the wiki. We’ve already posted announcements about it and made a tab especially for it. Do you have any ideas?</p>
