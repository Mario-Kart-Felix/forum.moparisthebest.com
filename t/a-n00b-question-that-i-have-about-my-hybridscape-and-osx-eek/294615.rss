    <title>A &quot;n00b&quot; question that i have about my HybridScape and OSX :eek: :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-n00b-question-that-i-have-about-my-hybridscape-and-osx-eek/294615</link>
    <description>Hello, i don&#39;t mean to spam or appear not to have read the stickys, but i have a few questions
1. first and formost i would realy appreciate if someone could tell me or direct me to a tut on how to give hp to monsters you create with the ::npc #### command or in the autospawn.cfg file. please include specific line i can &quot;copy and paste&quot; into needed class or java file, or a link to a tut.
2. This may be a bit simpler. I need to know how to Compile or &quot;build&quot; server sources once i have d-l&#39;ed them on mac osx (10.4.8 ppc) any help here would be AWSOME!!!

please don&#39;t say &quot;Get a pc!!!&quot; as i am 15 and w/o a job or source of income.

thx so much if you can help me!
 Update: i modified the npc.crg but they still have no hp. can someone PLEASEEEE help ME!?!?!!?!!?</description>
