    <description>[CENTER]Hey guys! Not sure if many people saw the public Vitality beta, it lasted about one week lmao. Quite a few reasons for this, the main two are:
[ul][li]Our vps company shut down[/li]
[li]We regret releasing the public beta, there were just too many glitches, and thus made it developer only.[/li][/ul]

.[/CENTER]

I understand that some people may just think we suck, but I really am trying haha :P We&#39;ve made it a closed beta, and are now coding it when we can. We use dropbox to code, but are open to new ideas. We&#39;ve got a forums with a small fan base of people waiting to try the server out. We are currently keeping it closed beta for the following reasons:

[ul][li]All the Jagex shutdowns, not worth trying to open a server at the minute.[/li]
[li]We want to make it much better[/li]
[li]We are fixing glitches[/li]
[li]We need more developers and a much bigger awareness of the server[/li][/ul]
