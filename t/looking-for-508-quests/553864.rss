    <title>Looking for 508 quests!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-508-quests/553864</link>
    <description>Hi!

I&#39;m trying to build a private server for me and some close friends (About 5-6 of us) and we want to have a few quests to complete in this server and have some great banter :P
Do you know where I can get some quests for my Davidscape server? I&#39;d be very grateful if you could provide us with some good quests, even those that come directly from Runescape itself. I&#39;d like at least 15 different quests in my server, if not more.
I kinda wanted to start an RSPS so that I could play privately with some friends, I didn&#39;t know the servers didn&#39;t contain any quests. Without quests, Runescape has no lore and it gets a little boring :(

Thanks in advance!  :D</description>

Are there any 400-599 versions of runescape that have a release with quests?<br>
