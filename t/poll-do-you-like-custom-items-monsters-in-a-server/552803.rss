<p>I’ve done that long time ago, finished 3 more new armour sets and weapons + more features.

<p>thats funny, because i made a 2007 chaos elemental in RSC form.</p>
<p>Well, I’m making sprites and textures for pk all day, but classickbds (ckx) hasn’t spoke to me in weeks.</p>
<p>I even made him a forum for his server.</p>
<p>If he doesn’t get back to me in another 3 weeks I’m going to modify the forum and give it or manage for someone else’s server. Sadly, I don’t have the sprites because my computer broke and ckx has the download links.</p>
<p>It’s all in his hands, he just doesn’t communicate very well.</p>
<p>Also, I’m not going to be makin. Sprites for anyone right now because of irl stuff.</p>
<p>Meh, in kinda over rsc anyways, I’m just gonna put noobscape v3 on a as card and leave, haha.</p>
<p>It seems like whenever I’m ready to quit I get new opportunities. Haha.</p>
<p>But I’m probably going to join slay pk again because I have the most affluence there right now (haha, more like burned bridges)</p>
<p>But I am still willing to hand over the forum I made, I’ll modify it to they specifications of your server.</p>

<p>Which server uses these sprites? :)[/quote]</p>

              <p>I think custom items/npcs are great if implemented in a more professional manor i guess saying as in when people just throw a bunch of random content together and create a big pile of shit then no i dont like customs, that makes me hate them, but when someone makes a new map adds some theme and maybe a story line and some new objects and rewards and just a few custom npcs just to show they went that extra step and created something unique and different then yes i love customs.</p>
