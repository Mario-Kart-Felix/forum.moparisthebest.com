    <description>[center][b][font=comic sans ms][size=2em]-The Living Free Server- IP:173.17.84.192[/size][/font][/b]
[/center]

Introducing the all-new LivingFree server! We are a VERY new cracked server, run by experienced server admins, and we are always welcoming new players! Our rules are very basic: Please speak English. No griefing, nor stealing. Respect the admins and your fellow players. Don&#39;t excessively breed animals. And that&#39;s it!  :D  
Our plug-ins are:
Residence
CommandsEX
PermissionsEX
BOSEconomy
Carz
Pitfall
Lift
DynamicShop
FatGiants


[size=14pt]The LivingFree server is all about adding what single player Minecraft has lacked: community! When playing on LFserver, you could easily find yourself playing for hours, enjoying the good company! So give us a try, and help us build up to be a greater server![/size]</description>
