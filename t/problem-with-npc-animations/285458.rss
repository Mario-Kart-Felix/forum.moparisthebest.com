    <title>Problem with NPC animations</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-npc-animations/285458</link>
    <description>Hi I have been working on a server, and I am currently working on Barrows, and I have set up there location, drops and all that stuff and I went to test fight them and when I attack them its fine but when they attack back there animation is something like they put there weapon all the way to the ground then shake their head no.

So my question is how do I change NPC attack animations?  :confused:

Also Im running a 508 server

Thanks,
Tian</description>
