Inspiration is back and better then ever! Join now and be a part of a server with tons of Players, Active PKing, Great Eco, Perfect Staking, and More!

[U][B]Players[/B][/U]


At Inspiration, we have are happy to say that we have a great community. With more and more players joining each day, you will feel right at home within the community. Joining members are praised, not bashed/flamed/picked on like some servers communities do. We believe that a happy, kind community leads to players having the most enjoyment and fun time on our server. Join today and make a quick introduction and see for yourself!


[U][B]Pking[/B][/U]

Inspiration has a flawless Pking system. Switches and clicks are perfect. We take pride on the fact to have an active Wildy that you can get into at all times of the day and easily get a fight whether you are a Pure, Hybrid, Dher, you name it. The Clan Scene on Inspiration is great, with Clan fights taking place almost every week. Join today and take a quick look at the Clan sections and see for yourself!

[U][B]Great Economy[/B][/U]


Inspiration likes to pride itself on the fact it has great Economy. No items are flooded in mass amounts, and Drop Rates from monsters are just right to keep players happy. If you are an avid trader, Inspirations markets are the place for you. With out special designed market places, in-game you can find what you&#39;re looking for in seconds, otherwise you can just head to our forum marketplace and let the offers stack up.

[U][B]Staking[/B][/U]


If the Duel Arena is your home on Runescape Private Servers, you will instantly fall in love with Inspiration. With our identical staking system with Runescape itself, you will have fun time winning and amassing massive wealth. All types of stakes work, and work in a fair environment where both players have no worries on outside factors effecting their staking (Glitches, lag, broken rules).


[U][B]Staff[/B][/U]

Inspiration has one of the best run Staff Teams around. We are dedicated to helping and meeting the needs of the players. We give players the utmost respect, and treat them the same way they treat us. If you need help, any part of the Staff Team will help you instantly. With our tiers of Staff, you can easily find who can help you with what. Do you need help finding something? Shoot a PM to our Server supports. Think someone is breaking the rules? Shoot a PM to our Moderators. On Inspiration, our Team conducts themselves in the best manner possible, to keep the players happy.

[U][B]Forums[/B][/U]


If you love having active, clean, fun Forums, Inspiration is the place for you. With many new members each day, all sections of the forums are insanely active, whether it&#39;s a discussion going on about the server, or a cool achievement finished by a player, you can always find something to do. We also have cool incentives for our active posters, like cool titles and custom avatars based on post count. This helps players distinguish themselves in the community and let other players see their dedication.
