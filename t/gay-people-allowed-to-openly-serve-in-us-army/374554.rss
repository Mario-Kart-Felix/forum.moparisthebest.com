    <description>The law, known as DADT, which prevented gay people from openly being in the US army has been repealed.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Ask,_Don%27t_Tell_Repeal_Act_of_2010

How did America&#39;s conservatives justify the blatant discrimination of this law anyway?</description>

A nice rule would be “Don’t sleep with eachother”.<br>
You don’t need DADT for that.<br>
Just like every other job.</p>

              <p>also <a class="mention" href="/u/frell">@frell</a>, huddling to stay warm should be irrelevant of someones sexuality to stay warm, unless you’re uncomfortable with your own sexuality then it shouldnt bother you, women and men huddle together to keep warm without the guy slipping his dick in the girl, so why not 2 guys and one who happens to be gay? i like the way you assume gays are raving sex addicts and just want to fuck stuff until thier dick falls off.<br>
p.s. this may have already been posted but i couldnt be arsed to read all the frell bashing, there was a lot not gonna lie</p>

I think if you’re in the military you should just be in the military.[/quote]</p>
<p>I totally agree. Actually, no, I don’t, but I’ll play along.</p>

</aside>
<p>If by <span class="bbcode-s">writing letters(oops)</span> showing affection you mean sexually harassing female soldiers then sure, <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,462888.0.html" data-bbcode="true">its been what a month?</a></p>
<p>But seriously, if your justification of such a law that gay people in the military will instantly start disregarding military rules and jump on each others ass the moment it is removed, then your views on such a matter are seriously disturbing. If it’s legal for straight people, it should be legal for gay people. If it’s ILLEGAL for straight people, it should be ILLEGAL for gay people, that’s the whole point of EQUAL rights, no one gets special treatment.</p>
<p>Oh, and if a group of soldiers are freezing to death and a straight soldier won’t huddle with a gay soldier for warmth because he’s too insecure with his sexuality that he’d rather die, then he shouldn’t be serving in the military, end of. The discrimination is already there, removal of the law wont change anything, except maybe give people the rights they deserve.[/quote]</p>

[/quote]<br>
That’s very silly, a lot of gay people work jobs with other gay people and they don’t automatically want to shack up with each other. Take an office job for example two gay guys work in cubicles next to each other, they don’t automatically go off to the store cupboard on their lunch break for a quick shag. Same with if a straight guy and girl are placed next to each other, they don’t go off and shag whenever.[/quote]</p>

</aside>
<p>If by <span class="bbcode-s">writing letters(oops)</span> showing affection you mean sexually harassing female soldiers then sure, <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,462888.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">its been what a month?</a></p>
<p>But seriously, if your justification of such a law that gay people in the military will instantly start disregarding military rules and jump on each others ass the moment it is removed, then your views on such a matter are seriously disturbing. If it’s legal for straight people, it should be legal for gay people. If it’s ILLEGAL for straight people, it should be ILLEGAL for gay people, that’s the whole point of EQUAL rights, no one gets special treatment.</p>
<p>Oh, and if a group of soldiers are freezing to death and a straight soldier won’t huddle with a gay soldier for warmth because he’s too insecure with his sexuality that he’d rather die, then he shouldn’t be serving in the military, end of. The discrimination is already there, removal of the law wont change anything, except maybe give people the rights they deserve.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s very silly, a lot of gay people work jobs with other gay people and they don’t automatically want to shack up with each other. Take an office job for example two gay guys work in cubicles next to each other, they don’t automatically go off to the store cupboard on their lunch break for a quick shag. Same with if a straight guy and girl are placed next to each other, they don’t go off and shag whenever.</p>

<p>Like when you huddle together to stay warm. If other troops know you’re gay no one will want to huddle. When you remove DADT other troops are going to become discriminative also.</p>

</aside>
<p>I will say like someone else have said before me. Why wait with something that can give less work, you don’t need to care about people being gay, and you get more people on the army.<br>
It is in a war you need less work and more people, not in peacetime.</p>
