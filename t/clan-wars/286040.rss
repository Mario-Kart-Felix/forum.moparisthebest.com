    <title>Clan wars?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clan-wars/286040</link>
    <description>Hello there..

I tried to make clan wars to work but I failed really bad.


i made a java file with the code and when i compile it says I need a class file. Well I have no idea how to make a class file. 


Do you have any advice? Or a clan wars tutorial? i used the search button and I couldn&#39;t find anything. I&#39;m not sure that if I make the class file clan wars will work.. It&#39;s worth a try.. 


Any help is well appreciated.
