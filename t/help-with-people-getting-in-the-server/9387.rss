    <title>Help with people getting in the server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-people-getting-in-the-server/9387</link>
    <description>Hey guys my friend splid has just let take over the run of his server although he still runs it sometimes i run it otherwise anyway. He told me to make a new ip. So i went on no.ip and made splidscape2.servegame.com that was the ip for the server so i thought. When i try give it to my friends they say they cannot get in i have no idea why is there anything else i have to do they cant even get in with my ip address not sure why but the only way they can get in is if i use hamachi and quite a few of my friends do not like using hamachi so i would rather not like to use hamachi if anyone could help me it would be much appreciated. All the best. Blaze</description>
