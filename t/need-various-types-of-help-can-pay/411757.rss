    <title>Need Various Types of Help (Can Pay)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-various-types-of-help-can-pay/411757</link>
    <description>Whomever helps my server will get their name included on my forums, of course, and in-game reward if they choose.
OR
We have $25 in donations so far. We can give this to any helpers.

Needed Update List (will update as completed)

1. Slayer Tasks and Drops (BADLY)
2. Monster Drops &amp; Rates (you can just tell us where to look and how to change, no Teamviewer necessary [I hope])
3. Need DClaws Spec. Ours actually currently has NO spec. If someone could add 4-hit Spec. we&#39;d all apprecticate (Remember, Reward)
4. Trade is glitched (you trade somebody then they trade u and the interface won&#39;t open.

I can also pay RSGP if insisted.

Thanks from DClawz Community in Advance!</description>
