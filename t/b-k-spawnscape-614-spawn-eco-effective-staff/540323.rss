What makes this server different than alot of spawn servers? 
- The staff are 95% always active.
- We care about what our players want.
- We care about updating our server.
- We listen to our players.
- We are active on the forums.

When you log on, you get a basic starter kit. As you make more accounts per-ip you get less per starter kit. There is safe pvp and dangerous pvp. In safe pvp,
you will not lose your items, although in dangerous you will.

Tired of going on Spawn servers where glitchers are always caught but never dealt with? Well not on my server, we deal with them immediately. Although loot glitching
is fun, we don&#39;t tolerate it. My co-owner and my self are looking for a good community that we can provide a great pking experience for. So if you would come join
us at [url=http://www.bnkspawnscape614.webs.com]B &amp; K SpawnScape 614[/url]


If you&#39;d like, register on our website to become an active member of the new community!
