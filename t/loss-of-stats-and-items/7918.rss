    <description>ok a problem recently arose in my server causing ppl&#39;s stats to reset and their items to be lost....i am so busy working on the server i have had no time to go see for myself but i can remember it happening to me as well...but in the workds of some 1 who has had it happen quite a few times........

nov68922: ok well
nov68922: it gets really laagy and then it laggs out
nov68922: we log back in and we see our stuff we last ahd but then it dissapears
nov68922: and we have lvl 3 shit empty freind list
nov68922: and its like brnad new guy
nov68922: happend to me and ross like 4 times

anyway i have seen many sources with an autosave feature that saves characters profiles every like 30 seconds...and auto restarts that reset the server every 30 mins to lessen lag and save the servers status.....well alot of the ones i have seen suck and i was wondering where some good ones might be....would they help with this problem....and is that what i should do to fix ths or is it an error in player saves coding?....any help would b appreciated</description>
