[B]The Upgraded Combat System[/B]
Runescape has had over a million updates but the most important updates are the combat related ones.. The change of the special or the emote when hitting something, RS has changed a lot from 07’ – 012’ And I am going to rip the best parts out of all the small updates they have been making since 07.. Lately Rs got upgraded to a new Combat system, thousands of players quit.. Now you may ask why? Well ya its very simple, it aint RS no more.. To many special/bonus/rare hits.. But even though the emotes and gfx are very good looking! Now also a reason why they stop playing is cus things which we have developed as players are not possible no more, one of these things is Bridding. Hybriding was a mix of all the combat styles we can use in game to play with the other, you can make people crazy with hybridding, mostly used with Magic &amp; melee. And That’s why bridding will be smooth as f*ck in my combat system!

Because that is not true at all. There's a lot more to RuneScape than just combat. There are seven skills that require combat: Attack, Strength, Defence, Constitution, Magic, and Summoning. Other combat related skills like Prayer, Slayer, and Dungeoneering can be trained without even attacking a monster and have been done before. The rest of the skills, and two more coming out this year, don't require combat at all. But good luck with this.
