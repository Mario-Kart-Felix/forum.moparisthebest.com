    <title>Building iOS apps?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/building-ios-apps/546848</link>
    <description>I have been asked by work to build two mobile applications, which I have never done. One, seems simple, the other, I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;ll just post the two, and some questions, any that you can answer, that&#39;d be awesome. 


[ol][li]Build a mobile application for iPhones that can be used as a &quot;strobe&quot; light or bike light. It should just have two flashing colors, that are vivid and easy to distinguish. Possibly an on/off button, but these are the only requirements.[/li]
[li]Monitor a child&#39;s use of a device. Scenario- A child must play 15 minutes of a math game, and then they can use any app they want for five minutes. In other words, I need a system that can detect how long an application has been open, and whether this is activity within the app. And notifications after 15 minutes that say, &quot;You can now play a game of your choice.&quot; and when in a game, &quot;Your time has run out!&quot;[/li][/ol]


So those are the two applications that I&#39;m expected to read and research. Here are some brief questions I have..

[ul][li]What languages will I be working with?[/li]
[li]Is there a friendly WYSWIG for building applications?[/li]
[li]What actions will I have to perform to actually get the app put on the app store?[/li]
[li]How long can I expect these two applications to take?[/li][/ul]


If there is anyone that knows a little more about iOS and building applications, it&#39;d be awesome if you could answer some questions. Thanks much, The Web Guy.</description>

<p>I was thinking of this, but it turns out that he wants it on the App Store for more people to see. There are math game applications on the iPad, he wants it to be able to monitor that the game is actually being played, and not just running for 15 minutes, then, allows an entertainment game to be played for five minutes in return. It’ll teach kids how to be responsible and monitor their own time, and also teach them that they need to earn stuff.</p>

<p>You can monitor system activity. In this case the way the OP can achieve what he wants is simply by monitoring proceses. If a new process is active he can keep track of how long it was alive etc. I’m not too sure about killing the process if he wanted to do that or locking apps (ios8 might let you do that though).</p>

I don’t think you can access that either. There are workarounds for finding all apps installed, and their may even be a workaround for getting the current window but they don’t work 100% of the time[/quote]<br>
Well… They’ve recently been talking about integrating apps together in iOS 8.<br>
<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/developer/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.apple.com/ios/developer/</a></p>
<p>I’ve never heard of any app having any form of control over the device (other than ones by apple, or jailbroken apps). I don’t think it is possible to even allow an app to block you from opening other ones (again, without jailbreak). But with iOS 8 the rules may be a bit different…<br>
Android is way, way more open about things like that. However, doesn’t mean they allow it all.</p>
<p>You also used to be able to use Adobe Flash to make apps (like that strobe light one, would take ~3 minutes in Flash). But apple kinda removed support for it. I think Adobe made it possible to &gt;still&lt; use it by integrating AIR to the apps that you’d develop, but I haven’t really looked into it.</p>

<p>I’m also pretty sure Apple won’t let you monitor other apps like that. You’d have to be on a jailbroken device to even get close to the functionality you want.</p>

<p>Yeah, this is what I told my boss. I was thinking of building it off the built in task manager (when you hold in the home button). But otherwise I’m not sure of how else I would do it.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/tyb97">@tyb97</a> - Thanks for the information, I’ll look at that link and talk to them about a developers license, thanks man.</p>

              <p>I’ve built Android Apps, which have certain similarities. For iOS a developer license is $100 each year, if I remember correctly, so you should probably talk to your supervisors about that, so they can setup an account paid by them, which you will work through. Applications in iOS are written in Objective-C, or Swift. Here is the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">WYSIWYG</a> that Apple has displayed and recommend on their site. As to how long the two would take, the first one should take you a week since you don’t have any prior experience, and then the second one could take another two, to a whole month conservatively.</p>

              <p>I have been asked by work to build two mobile applications, which I have never done. One, seems simple, the other, I’m not sure. I’ll just post the two, and some questions, any that you can answer, that’d be awesome.</p>
<p>[ol][li]Build a mobile application for iPhones that can be used as a “strobe” light or bike light. It should just have two flashing colors, that are vivid and easy to distinguish. Possibly an on/off button, but these are the only requirements.[/li]<br>
[li]Monitor a child’s use of a device. Scenario- A child must play 15 minutes of a math game, and then they can use any app they want for five minutes. In other words, I need a system that can detect how long an application has been open, and whether this is activity within the app. And notifications after 15 minutes that say, “You can now play a game of your choice.” and when in a game, “Your time has run out!”[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>So those are the two applications that I’m expected to read and research. Here are some brief questions I have…</p>
<p>[ul][li]What languages will I be working with?[/li]<br>
[li]Is there a friendly WYSWIG for building applications?[/li]<br>
[li]What actions will I have to perform to actually get the app put on the app store?[/li]<br>
[li]How long can I expect these two applications to take?[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>If there is anyone that knows a little more about iOS and building applications, it’d be awesome if you could answer some questions. Thanks much, The Web Guy.</p>
