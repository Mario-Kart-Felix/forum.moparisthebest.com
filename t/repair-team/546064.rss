    <description>With our release of RS-Reborn nearing, there are probably going to be lots of bugs to be fixed. Since I&#39;d like to be able to produce content fairly often, I&#39;d like to get around 2 people who&#39;s soul purpose is to just fix bugs.

For those who don&#39;t know, RS-Reborn is a remake of RuneScape. Unlike many others, we actually know what we&#39;re doing and plan to take this project very far.

If applying, please fill out the form below.
