    <description>Hey guys,


First of all, is it possible to disable the sound of rs via smart? I&#39;ve got all the sounds onto nothing yet I still hear my account does X things.

Is it possible to get/look/update the some of the non-working scripts in the MSI panel?


Also is it possible to make it log in X world? mainly it keeps logging me into the main busy worlds and it is packed as hell.


That is all for now,

Thanks.</description>

              <p>You should browse through the SRL reference (I don’t know the link, but you can find it on Villavu). Pretty much everything you ask for is either part of a function (like log in to world X), doable with the help of a function (disable the sound) or a great way to learn SRL (updating scripts).</p>
<p>In other words, roll up your sleeves because it’s time for some DIY.</p>
