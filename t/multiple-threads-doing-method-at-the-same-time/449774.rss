    <title>Multiple threads doing method at the same time</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/multiple-threads-doing-method-at-the-same-time/449774</link>
    <description>Alright, it&#39;s getting late here, and I really want to have an answer on this question.

Let&#39;s say I have 500 threads. And I want all those threads performing a method at the same time. How would I do that?
First I thought that I could just let all the threads sleep n amount of seconds, continued by the action, but I thought that those threads will eventually run asynchronously, not sure though.

Any ideas on how I would let all the threads run synchronously? I&#39;m not very experienced with multi-threading and thread synchronization.</description>

Thanks for that link.</p>
<p>[quote=“Jmood, post:11, topic:449774”]Having multiple threads execute the same method is the easy part, the hard part is making sure your code is thread safe. When multi-threading you should make sure you sync on all I/O operation or else you will end up with a dead lock or weird things happening. Graham has written an informative thread on r-s about thread safety.</p>

<p>A thread is like a mini process that you can use to do, for example, blocking tasks like input/output. If you don’t use them when you have to serve multiple blocking clients (or anything that uses blocking IO) you will have a delay which can cause serious problems.[quote=“sinisoul, post:14, topic:449774”][quote author=Native^ link=topic=552669.msg4049695#msg4049695 date=1342387007]<br>

<p>Why hasn’t anyone posted an example yet? Anyway, say you were running those threads from a thread pool and wanted them to synchronize:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public synchronized void doSomething() { }; //Until method returns will block

public void doSomething() { synchronized(this /* or another context of synchronization */) { } };</code></pre>
<p>Or you can use: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html%5B/quote%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html[/quote]</a><br>
I’ll look into that.</p>

              <p>Alright, it’s getting late here, and I really want to have an answer on this question.</p>
<p>Let’s say I have 500 threads. And I want all those threads performing a method at the same time. How would I do that?<br>
First I thought that I could just let all the threads sleep n amount of seconds, continued by the action, but I thought that those threads will eventually run asynchronously, not sure though.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how I would let all the threads run synchronously? I’m not very experienced with multi-threading and thread synchronization.</p>
