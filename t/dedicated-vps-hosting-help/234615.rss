    <title>Dedicated/VPS hosting help?!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dedicated-vps-hosting-help/234615</link>
    <description>Hey guys and gals,
Just wanted to ask a for a few opinions on buying a dedi server or a VPS.
I have almost completed my newest server and want to buy a dedi server or VPS from the start within the next 2 days, so because i have never bought this before im just wanting to ask...
-Whats specs am i looking for for a clean running server?
-What prices are reasonable?
-Whats sites can you reccomend?
-Any other info i should know before purchasing...

I have been searching around and found this site
http://www.vpsland.com/ezwin.html (tell me if im not allowed to post link)
and thought starting on the STARTER PACKAGE and working my way up when i grew would be a decent idea. If not, TELL ME! :P

Thanks
