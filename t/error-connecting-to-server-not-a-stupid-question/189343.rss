    <title>Error connecting to server? (not a stupid question..)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server-not-a-stupid-question/189343</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had my own server for about 2 weeks now and for some strange reason I came home today and the server was still running.. as usual... however when I tried to log into my server, it said &#39;error connecting to server&#39;
So I closed the runserver cmd thingy and relaunched it, but it still gave me a &#39;error connecting to server&#39; problem and it is happening to all of my players.
Its been working perfectly fine for two weeks, dont know whyit just stopped... I am using SilabSoft client btw.
thanks in advance.
Ps. Yes I did search but it was all a bunch of newbs, and none of them even got help..</description>
