    <description>[b][u]IMPORTANT![/u]: Never buy any Lightro projects, they are free![/b]
[b][u]IMPORTANT[/u]!: Lightro is a private server source developing team, not a private server developing team![/b]

--[b]About Lightro[/b]--

 --[b]Team Code of Conduct:[/b]--
 [i]1. I [b]WILL NOT[/b] sell any projects we have made. If we have made a project that is declared free by me (Nets), and you sell it, you [b]WILL[/b] get banned from the development team.
2. I [b]WILL NOT[/b] flame any newcomers in this developing team and/or on this thread.
3. I [b]WILL NOT[/b] listen to any announcements made by anyone but Nets regarding Lightro.
4. I [b]WILL[/b] follow [b]ALL[/b] of the rules from the following link on the forums, thread, and anywhere regarding this development team: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,195719.0.html.[/i]

--[b]Current Project[/b]--
[u]Lightro Version Learning - FREE Learning Source[/u]
[b]Information:[/b]

 This project will be named [b]Lightro Version Learning[/b]. It will be focused on being a server source that will help out new coders learn how to code more than any other server source ever did. It will have premium comments and suggestions, and even full tutorials on how to add things! Think about it, you don&#39;t know how to add something, and it will say it [b]RIGHT THERE[/b]! 

 --[b]Current Status[/b]-- 
Version 0.7 (NOT READY TO BE RELEASED)
Lightro Project Learning is looking good so far. I have a tutorial on adding menus and making administrators and moderators built in. I also have a kill command for the owner only, an announcement command for moderators and over, and I have prevented party hat spawning by deleting the cracker effect.
