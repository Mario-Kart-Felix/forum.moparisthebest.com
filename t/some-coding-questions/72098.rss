    <title>Some coding questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-coding-questions/72098</link>
    <description>Ok, I was just wondering...
I have been much away now, and now I have to ask some questions, and i hope anyone can answer.
I know I&#39;m such a noob after the big break. :P


1. How is it possible to make just a public int use fist fighting. All i need is the code for fist fighting. Then I fix it by meself.

2. Possible to use a public int at xp rate? (making 1 person get 4x xp rate and another one get 1x xp rate by the same weapon/fist fighting)

3. Possible to make talking interface with 4 options you can CLICK 100%?


Thats it...

Sincerly,
Marius

PS: I think I was a better coder before I took this big break. :P[br][size=1]Posted on: 27-03-2007, 17:55:31[/size][hr][quote=&quot;mariuswb&quot;]Ok, I was just wondering...
