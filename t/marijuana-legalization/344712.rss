    <title>Marijuana legalization</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/marijuana-legalization/344712</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been hearing one side tell the other side that they&#39;re wrong, and vice-versa. I honestly think marijuana should be decriminalized. All that the government has done is arrest innocent people, and waste over $1 trillion. Marijuana grow ops will never stop, they can&#39;t stop, they aren&#39;t going to stop. Why doesn&#39;t the government just give up? Hell, Obama did weed and cocaine in High School. A majority of the people in the white house have done weed. No one has ever died from weed, so what&#39;s the deal with it? It&#39;s helped me with my schizophrenia. It gives me the ability to talk about mature things without adding in immaturity. It raises me to a new, better level. So why should it be decriminalized? What do you think?</description>

They should legalise because in amsterdam the amound of people smoking weed has decreased since its been legal and thats because people get bored and realise that beeing high isnt that good, so this proves that yes most people will be stoned all the time buy after a few years most people wont smoke anymore. Also the goverment are making money out of people smoking weed why do you think they sell blunts and long rizzla in the shops? not to make big roll ups or blunt roll ups, BECAUSE OF WEED. They are making money out of something which we shouldnt be doing and thats funny so yess if other words it should be legal and yes the govement no that they carnt do anything to stop it because in a way they are kinda helping us out <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> THANKS</p>
<p>LUKE :p[/quote]No. Nearly everything about your post is wrong. Also, salvia is an incense, not weed. It’s also related to other incense like K2 and “Black Magic”, which cause schizophrenia so have fun with that. Might I also add that making it legal doesn’t change the way people feel about how much they smoke it. They smoke it because they enjoy it, not because it’s illegal. By the way, the government doesn’t intentionally dispense blunt wraps across the US for people to use on marijuana. The distributors do it for money, not to aid illegal activity… It’s a LOT cheaper to buy blunts and joints to roll tobacco in rather than buying a pack of cigarettes or cigars, and THAT is why they sell them.</p>

<p>“…the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races.”</p>
<p>“Marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity, criminality, and death.”</p>
<p>“Reefer makes darkies think they’re as good as white men.”</p>
<p>“Marihuana leads to pacifism and communist brainwashing”</p>
<p>“You smoke a joint and you’re likely to kill your brother.”</p>
<p>“Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.”<br>

Isn’t that “Reefer Madness”?</p>

<p>The tax thing is what i’ve always heard from everyone, even smokers. Its easy to tax tobacco because it usually needs a couple preparation steps before it can be sold to customers. But weed IIRC can be grown and smoked, so it would be easy to just buy seeds and grow your own instead of buying it from a store if its legal. And it would probably knock cigarette sales out of the country.</p>
<p>I dont think it makes you stupid or kills braincells or anything like that. I just think its a big waste of time.<br>
[/quote]I smoke a lot more cigarettes than I do weed.<br>
[/quote]Cool. Why, it’s stupid. Don’t give me you’re shit on “it’s addictive”. At 16, you’re young enough to stop, it doesn’t take that much will power.[/quote]</p>
<p>Drinking and smoking cigs hurt your body worse then smoking weed. And they waste so much money over your life span.</p>

<p>The tax thing is what i’ve always heard from everyone, even smokers. Its easy to tax tobacco because it usually needs a couple preparation steps before it can be sold to customers. But weed IIRC can be grown and smoked, so it would be easy to just buy seeds and grow your own instead of buying it from a store if its legal. And it would probably knock cigarette sales out of the country.</p>
<p>I dont think it makes you stupid or kills braincells or anything like that. I just think its a big waste of time.</p>

<p>Don’t kid yourself…I think the fact that apple products suck is a…fact.[/quote]Kid myself? Must I go into detail on how far Apple has come in today’s technological world? Yes, there are other competitors that you might feel are better, but Apple was there from the beginning. Many of these leading competitors you put your money on got their ideas from Apple. You’re incredibly ignorant if you go on with this argument. Steve Jobs is incredibly successful and has made a HUGE impact on today’s technological world and society.</p>
<p>Pertaining to the actual topic, marijuana has killed no one. There are no causes of death directly from marijuana. There is, however, mass amounts of crime due to dealing and gangs related to it. This automatically pends it to the blacklist. Also, saying that it’s a gateway drug isn’t technically true. Any drug can be a gateway drug in that case, it’s just a matter of what you’re willing to try first. Marijuana has no violent side-effects.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">HUGE MISCONCEPTION</span></span><br>
“Marijuana kills your brain cells”. The story behind that goes as follows:<br>
Scientists did a study, obviously in favor of the government, to prove the theory that THC has a fatal affect on your brain cells. It was called the Heath-Tulane Study in 1974. Ronald Regan announced that through elaborate studies from extremely reliable scientists, it’s been proven that marijuana permanently damages brain cells.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">HERE IS WHAT THEY DIDN’T TELL YOU:</span></span><br>
The subjects were monkeys, and the procedure was through a gas mask. Doctor Heath pumped 63 COLUMBIAN strength joints into the gas mask, within a 5 minute period for 3 months. They never gave them any OXYGEN. When you don’t have any oxygen, of course you’re going to lose brain cells. It’s funny, because in 2005, they actually did a study that showed results in improving brain cells rather than destroying them.</p>

<blockquote>"There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos, and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz, and swing, result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers, and any others.”
<p>“…the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races.”</p>
<p>“Marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity, criminality, and death.”</p>
<p>“Reefer makes darkies think they’re as good as white men.”</p>
<p>“Marihuana leads to pacifism and communist brainwashing”</p>
<p>“You smoke a joint and you’re likely to kill your brother.”</p>

<p>But keep it illegal. I enjoy watching our prisons get over crowded. I love releasing rapists and child molesters early because we need more room for non violent marijuana smokers. I enjoy the fact that I can make a fortune from selling it to your children. And an even bigger fortune by cutting it with potentially harmful substances to add weight to it. I take comfort knowing I can join a violent drug gang that deals with smuggling it to the USA from Canada. I couldn’t have any of this if it were made legal <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

You just have friends who can’t make marijuana part of their life and can only make it their life. I have friends like that and I have friends who smoke it seldom. I use it for chronic migraines, chronic motor tics, and anxiety and its the only that helps for the chronic disorders as I have either had bad side effects or allergic reactions to many pills I have been presribed. Marijuana is the safest drug out there and people need to start realizing it. When people have an illness and try pot, their opinion on the drug usually changes as mine did when my problems went away when I smoked.</p>

Wrong^^ its not legalized because the government cant tax it.</p>
<p>I have never tried pot and never will because i really dont care, but i dont think it should be legalized because i have many friends who started spending all their school breaks and weekends just sitting inside and smoking and if its legalized that influence will go crazy (imagine if Albert Einstein started smoking)<br>
[/quote]The government can easily tax it. They already do. There are legal marijuana distributors for medical reasons in <a href="http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881" data-bbcode="true">14 different states</a> at the moment. It’s called medical marijuana. You can either grow it yourself, or buy it from a distributor.</p>
<p>Also, if Albert Einstein smoked, it would have no “lower educated” result. It doesn’t effect how smart you are.[/quote]<br>
He would have spent time smoking instead of creating his theory of relativity. Its not how much knowledge you have, its how you use it.</p>
<p>You can get Marijuana seeds very easily and grow it yourself and sell it, the government cannot tax that unless its an official store.</p>
