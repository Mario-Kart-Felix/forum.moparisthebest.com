    <title>Obfuscator? Some problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/obfuscator-some-problems/489787</link>
    <description>Does anyone know of a free obfuscator that actually works? I&#39;ve tried all of the popular ones such a ProGuard, yGuard, JavaGuard and none of them seem to be working for me at all. They either give me errors when attempting to obfuscate, or they don&#39;t obfuscate the output at all.

I tried an evaluation version of a paid obfuscator called DashO, and it seems to work fine, all my classes were obfuscated and I was able to run the jar file, however some features didn&#39;t work, does anyone know why?

Are there any out there that work?</description>

              <p>I use proguard4.8 just fine. Are you sure you are setting it up correctly? The only settings that I had to put in are the input.jar and output.jar, along with the class to keep. It does the rest.</p>
