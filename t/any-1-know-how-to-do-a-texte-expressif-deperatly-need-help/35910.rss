    <description>I have french class and I&#39;m pretty good in french but I&#39;ve been absent a lot and was wondering if some one could help me out with this. Does any one know the basic format/outline of &quot;Un texte expressif&quot;? It&#39;s a type of essay or writing format close to &quot; Un Text du oppinion&quot; but not the same thing. If any knows the format and how I should write it please let me know. Thanks a lot everybody I desperatly need this answer. Take care all. ~~~ Snow ~~~</description>
