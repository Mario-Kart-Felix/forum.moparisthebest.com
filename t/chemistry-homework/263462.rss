    <title>Chemistry Homework</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chemistry-homework/263462</link>
    <description>So, 3 weeks into Chemistry and I have a shit load of work I need to catch up on.
Doing it all tonight and I&#39;m about half way.
Just stuck on two questions/Couldn&#39;t be fucked researching. :)

[hr]

Q16) [b]Propose[/b] how the following separations could be achieved :
[b]a[/b] iron filings from an iron filings-charcoal mixture.
[b]b[/b] sugar from a sugar solution.
[b]c[/b] small amounts of insecticide from a fruit.
[b]d[/b] oxygen from air.
[b]e[/b] red bloods cells from blood plasma.
[b]f[/b] water from sea water.

Q17) [b]Identify[/b] eight common but useful materials and [b]classify[/b] these as elements, compounds, homogeneous mixtures or heterogeneous mixtures. [b]Identify[/b] which of these materials are used in a naturally occurring form and which have been processed in some way.

[hr]

Any help is appreciated.
With Q16, things like Crystallisation, Chromatography, Distillation, Sieving and so on are the methods that I need to answer in.
With Q17, I already have 6, but I&#39;m not quite sure If I did it right. So, explanations would be great.
Moving onto my Physics homework while I wait, ahh.</description>
