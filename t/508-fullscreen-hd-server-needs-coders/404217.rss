    <title>508 FullScreen HD Server Needs Coders!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-fullscreen-hd-server-needs-coders/404217</link>
    <description>[center]Hello!
I got bored one day and thought to myself, HEY! I could make a private server just like I used to do back when I got bored like a year ago!
So now I am putting this idea back into action!
I can&#39;t really do it on my own though because I&#39;m not that good of a coder...
 
SO! I need a few people to code, make models and help me make this an awesome private server that people can have fun on and enjoy!
Once you join my team I will send you what I have on the server so far and we can code it up until I feel the server is ready to launch! Then I will buy a VPS so we can be up 24/7 and we&#39;ll see how it goes!

What I&#39;m Looking For
1. People I don&#39;t mind talking to
2. People who know what they&#39;re doing
3. People who won&#39;t abuse they&#39;re rights and be asses

My Goals for the Server?

Personally I like the new HD 614 servers so that&#39;s what I will be doing!
I&#39;m not sure how good my ideas are so I&#39;ll tell em to you once I hire you and we&#39;ll see where it goes

Staff:
Coder
1.
2.

Modeler
1.
2.

That&#39;s it, all I&#39;m really looking for are 2 coders and 2 moders, I&#39;m not going to put myself as a coder however because I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m that good lol.
