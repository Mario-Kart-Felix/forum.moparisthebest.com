If you want to go all out, and buy something worth over $140. Then you should get this as a gift! It does absolutely everything. First off, it can play very good Video Games, great graphics, Next it can have Videos(Just by adding them from the internet,LimeWire) Next, it can have Music too! And you can go on the Internet with this. And last but not least! ITS PORTABLE! Amazing. Your whole Magic Machine portable with you everywhere! 
Price:
NEW: $180-$200 (JUST FOR THE PSP AND CHARGER, NOT PACKET)

Yes, thats right, The Fashion Industry today goes far beyond with shoes, And probably the best shoes out are Air Force One Shoes. They went far! Around 281 Million Dollars spent in America from Air Force One shoes! Just to keep up with the fashionables ;)
Price:
General Store: $85.00
Discount Stores: $65.00

And if that does not help out, try out the Rolex Wrist Watches! Perfect for a Christmas present! They are very great with wearing. out of 100 People, probably 99 of them would love a gift like this! 
Price:
General Store: $200-$750
Discount Stores: $170-$600
