    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-pk-point-pking/433961</link>
    <description>I have a problem I&#39;ve been trying to make the code for when you kill someone, you receive an amount of pk points.

I&#39;ve massively failed whilst doing it... I&#39;ve been searching all over mopar for a tut/pi and I can&#39;t seem to find one...

Could any of you help me?

Sorry for the hassal...</description>
