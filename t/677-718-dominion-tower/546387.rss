    <description>Hello,

Does anybody know to fix this.

If i go and Play Dominion Towers Minigame and Gain a Dominion Factor of say 10,000. if i Log and and back in the Dominion Factor Sticks and its still at 10,000
But if i update anything on the server or just restart the server it resets back to 0...

If anybody knows how to fix this that would be great. ill post my DominionTower.java but i dont really know of anything else to post with it

[url=http://pastebin.com/TK3QZkx9]http://pastebin.com/TK3QZkx9[/url]

I had to put it on Pastebin because of the Character limit

Thanks

EDIT
-----------------------

Fixed it. I had used 
[code]public static int dominionFactor;[/code]
in the dominiontower,java to make it so that the dialogue for the dominion shop ive set up could read the amount

ive not put the int in player.java and removed the static. and added player. before dominionfactor

cheers anyway</description>
