    <description>What is the best political ideology?

Communism won&#39;t work because of human nature. I really don&#39;t understand how people can think it can work when it has failed numerous times. Sure USSR&#39;s economy boomed but the quality of life diminished incredibly.</description>

<p>communism isn’t a political ideology, and in the sense that people think of it as one there has never been a communist country before</p>
<p>on the subject of a communist state, in the sense that I understand it I think it can totally work, strict guidelines would need to be followed and I don’t necessarily think it can be done with a whole country but a micro-nation communist state would work I think</p>

              <p>The “Human Nature” argument is a poor argument. You should know that life under the Tsar wasn’t that good either, and I’ve heard no-one claiming post Stalin Soviet to be communist. For while Stalin and Lenin might both be communists, the state itself wasn’t transformed into a communist state. While you could call a state with that intent communist, USSR had for the most time not this intent.</p>
<p>I would make the case that Cuba is the world most successful country, on the basis of two things. Their way of life is sustainable, and they have the best living standard among such countries.</p>
<p>North Korea have a glorious future with its finding of valuable metals in their mountains. Their control over economy secures that the resources wouldn’t be pocketed by an American company. If they manage to fight of US invaders. (If they can avoid South Korea, that would be another Vietnam). Their new Kim in charge has shown promising signs, but not signs of stupidity, so their new riches might benefit the people.</p>
<p>To close this off, in Easy Germany and Romania, about 50% think life was better with Soviet.<br>

This high percentage should tell us something. If USSR and USA didn’t try to impress each other all the time, things could be much better.</p>

What is the best type of government for the people?</p>
<p>Democracy, Communism, Totalitarianism? Or some other form?<br>
[/quote]<br>
i don’t think any of those are forms of governments…[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t know. Bowser wanted me to make a topic so I made one.</p>
<p>Isn’t it obvious what I am asking?</p>
<p>Edit: Changed thread title.<br>
Edit2: This thread is retarded. I’m sure people will use their common sense to understand what is trying to be discussed.</p>
<p>Communism won’t work because of human nature. I really don’t understand how people can think it can work when it has failed numerous times. Sure USSR’s economy boomed but the quality of life diminished incredibly.</p>
