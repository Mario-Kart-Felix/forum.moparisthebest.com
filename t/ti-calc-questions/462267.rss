    <title>TI-Calc Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ti-calc-questions/462267</link>
    <description>I&#39;m starting TI-Calculator threads now for mainly the 83-84 versions.
I just want to get back to programming BASIC and making complex calculator programs again.

To start off I want to ask all of you who program or have ever used a program on a TI-Calc:
[b]
[size=14pt][i]What is/are the most advanced/complex things you can program/have heard of/or seen?[/i][/size][/b]</description>

<p>Also, you’re not correct, I’ll be more than happy to continue posting on this thread, because I enjoy writing programs for my calculators.</p>
<p>Furthermore, why don’t you actually address the points I’ve raised instead of telling me to go away? Is it because you realize that I’m right? Is it because you think ignoring the points others bring up and telling them to go away somehow proves your points and invalidates their? Or is it something else entirely? I would really like to know.</p>
<p>P.S. Who is this genius you speak of?</p>

<p>When I was in school we were limited to the 84, the 89 wasn’t allowed because it wasn’t allowed on the AP test or SAT, and the nspire definitely wasn’t allowed. In fact, any CAS or anything with a QWERTY keyboard wasn’t allowed</p>

              <p>Lmao since you want a reason so badly how about because I’m more familiar with the versions I said than I am with the Nspire…<br>
When I was in highschool the Nspire didn’t even exist. LOL</p>

<p>An example equation could simply be SinB / (a/SinA) = b</p>

<p>You have to be a little bit more specific <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
I haven’t programmed a math program, let alone did anything involving math, in ages.<br>
So if I’m correct… the user must input SinB and SinA and possibly ‘a’ and result with the answer ‘b’?<br>
Please list all the variables and their values so I can get to work on this program <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
