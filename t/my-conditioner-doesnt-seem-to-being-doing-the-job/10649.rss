    <title>My conditioner doesn&#39;t seem to being doing the job</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-conditioner-doesnt-seem-to-being-doing-the-job/10649</link>
    <description>What conditioner do you use? I don&#39;t really care about guys conditioner versus girls&#39;s conditioner. 

Women probably have the edge, because they have better conditioners lol. Know any good ones? (Talking to everyone here)

Oh and I&#39;m using Suave Conditioner. It makes the hair kind of soft, but not as soft as it should be. I also tried Pert Plus which sucks cause it is Shampoo and Conditioner mixed. Those brands never work for me. 

Thanks in advance.</description>

<p>And I just want my silky smooth hair back. I used to always have it, but ever since 2 months ago my shampoo isn’t working. I dont know, maybe my Shampoo is spoilt. That could be a problem lol.

<p>You should only need to condition once a month though.</p>

              <p>What conditioner do you use? I don’t really care about guys conditioner versus girls’s conditioner.</p>
<p>Women probably have the edge, because they have better conditioners lol. Know any good ones? (Talking to everyone here)</p>
<p>Oh and I’m using Suave Conditioner. It makes the hair kind of soft, but not as soft as it should be. I also tried Pert Plus which sucks cause it is Shampoo and Conditioner mixed. Those brands never work for me.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
