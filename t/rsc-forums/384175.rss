    <description>Anyone happen to have any pictures of the 2001 RuneScape forums? Been looking for some but I can&#39;t really find very many.

What I really need is a picture of the forums home... :(

No one? I know I&#39;ve seen a picture of the forums home awhile back, but stupidly never saved the picture and can not remember what I searched to find it...</description>
