    <description>Okay I re-portforwarded today after a storm that knocked out power and reset the router, It says my Default Gateway is the same (192.168.1.1) but it is also my preferred DNS server, my alternate DNS server is the one that was preferred before. Please Help</description>

              <p>Well my cmd path is messed up but I went to C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\<a href="http://Command.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Command.com</a> and I did it from there and all my DNS settings are the same as before but I can’t get it to host and the PFportchecker still says they’re open and while on my static ip I can use the internet. I just doesn’t seem to work. Also my browser thing is 192.168.1.1</p>

              <p>Go into cmd and type ip config/all look for the ipv4 settings then type this in into your browser “192.168.0.1” look for your DNS settings then put all the stuff in.</p>
