    <title>How To Get My Server To Run</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-get-my-server-to-run/225747</link>
    <description>Please help me get my server to run. I&#39;ve been trying to get it to run for about a week now. By the way I downloaded the server, which can be the problem. When I click Run-Server, it says its online, but when I try my ip-address it won&#39;t let me log in. The ip is Blitzkingdom.no-ip.biz. If you know the problem, and can get it to run properly, i&#39;ll give you admin. =) 


              P.S. My aim screen name is &quot;John Podzinski&quot;</description>

              <p>Try Compiling Server and try editing in a command and it might start up<br>
Or you might have a Server that is trying to delete your windows stuff<br>
Make sure no files have del.windows in them or anything such as that</p>
