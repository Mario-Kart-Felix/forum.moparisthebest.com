    <title>Can&#39;t buy items from ALL point shops [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-buy-items-from-all-point-shops-pi/555242</link>
    <description>This includes slayerPoints, votePoints, pcPoints, donatorPoints!

When i go to open the store I can check the price, and it will show the value in the right currency. But even if i have a sufficient amount of points when i go to buy the item, it does not appear in my inventory and i do not loose any points. What am i doing wrong?</description>

I was curious to determine if that is what is happening. Could of replaced the MenuInteractionItemOption1(Value <span class="bbcode-i">item</span>) to support the shop but missed the actual buy methods as well.</p>
