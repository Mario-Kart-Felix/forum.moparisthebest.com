    <title>RageScape Needs A CODER!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ragescape-needs-a-coder/437295</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I just opened up a server and I need a coding partner to help me. I&#39;m an average coder so I need someone that&#39;s really good. I&#39;m not going to let you do most of the work I just need help with certain things. I fixed a lot of stuff on my server but I still need help with some things. If you want to apply just follow this format and I will get back to you.

FORMAT:

Name:
Age:
Email/Skype:
On a scale of 1-10, what would you rate yourself as a coder. (1 as in terrible 10 as in amazing)
Coding Experience:

NOTE: Coders get Admin status.

Thanks for reading and please no negative comments :/. I know how the community is nowadays so please try to keep it to yourself thanks.

Sincerely, 

Rage</description>
