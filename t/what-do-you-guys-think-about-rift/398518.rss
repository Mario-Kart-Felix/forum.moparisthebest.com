    <title>What do you guys think about Rift?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-guys-think-about-rift/398518</link>
    <description>I want to know your opinions.

I made account, started a trial and then downloaded the client for 3 hours(They really should make it so you can play it while it&#39;s downloading like WoW), after it was ready I logged in, created a character, I liked how you could create a character that looks exactly like you, after creating a character and skipping the cinematic, I played a while and thought that the characters look pretty..gayish and not like they should look in a fantasy game, and the starting area(maybe the whole world?) was too grim for my liking. I never got out of the starting area, since the game was damn boring, quests and all were all the same, xp from quests were also horrible(For example, you got a quest where you have to kill 5 of some creatures which give 100xp each returning the quest will give about 200xp?)...

I didn&#39;t like it at all.</description>

<p>Could try this; <a href="http://www.wow-one.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.wow-one.com/</a><br>
Haven’t played either, but I’ve heard good things about the Vanilla one.</p>

I never bought WOLK, I still have WoW BC. I never got to experience that, but it’s good as it is aswell. It’s actually more addictive now.<br>
Last christmas I decided to subscribe to see what changes the Catalysm did and I played whole month, before I usually quit after 2 weeks because it got boring or something. and I’ve played so far, but I will stop now because its summer</p>

Just cause Rift is failed game doesn’t make me dumb…All of my friends who have bought the game(because there was no trial at first) quit the game within a day.</p>

              <p>So you can make the character to look exactly like you, and you thought it ended looking gay.<br>
So you think you are gay looking?</p>
<p>Doesn’t sound like the game’s fault.(jk)</p>

              <p>I want to know your opinions.</p>
<p>I made account, started a trial and then downloaded the client for 3 hours(They really should make it so you can play it while it’s downloading like WoW), after it was ready I logged in, created a character, I liked how you could create a character that looks exactly like you, after creating a character and skipping the cinematic, I played a while and thought that the characters look pretty…gayish and not like they should look in a fantasy game, and the starting area(maybe the whole world?) was too grim for my liking. I never got out of the starting area, since the game was damn boring, quests and all were all the same, xp from quests were also horrible(For example, you got a quest where you have to kill 5 of some creatures which give 100xp each returning the quest will give about 200xp?)…</p>
<p>I didn’t like it at all.</p>
