    <title>Yoshi&#39;s New Island</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/yoshis-new-island/541318</link>
    <description>I just got it the other day and it&#39;s pretty great. The gameboy advanced version was actually my very first video game so it has more meaning to me. It&#39;s pretty fun and almost exactly like the gba version except 3d, new bosses and new power ups. I also got pokemon y for free :) anyone else play it? What do you guys think?</description>
