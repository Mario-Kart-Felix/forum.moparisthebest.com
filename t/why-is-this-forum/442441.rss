<p>I’m not sure. I know that for awhile there people were taking out and adding random snippets of code into the original and consistently uploading them trying to keep the original alive. I will post the original if I find the link again.</p>
<p>There is even evidence dating back to 2004 that suggests early development of RSPS.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Found this on my old PC back when I was actively on kaitnieks etc, this is the first concept of a server that I know of from 2005. As you can see it’s completely far from complete. (Still having half of it as txt files and todo lists.)</p>

<p>I’ll look for the first functional design and post it.</p>
<p>Btw, if you see a similar post on R-S, I am Jeff, super_ and I had a discussion about this which prompted me to create a thread.</p>

<p>I totally agree. There are many communities dedicated to programming, but for some reason, I still stick to this one.  ;D</p>

Yes, but bringing new people into programming just adds on to the kids who give up, leech some server, then put it online.</p>

I’m not saying it isn’t fixable, Taharok agrees that there are things we could do to raise the excitement about Moparscape and RSPS development. Just think about this: how many potential people play RSPS, but don’t get into development because they aren’t sure where to start? Just a thought ;)[/quote]</p>
<p>You guys should do something to bring in more people or something. Raise the excitement for moparscape and RSPS!!</p>

In fact if you didn’t count the general discussion section and made a graph of the posts at Moparscape, I think the numbers would be down a lot.

<p>Personally I’ve noticed this forum is ‘enemies’ with R- Serv and R locus. Why? I don’t know, they all do the same thing. Like literally. But if you link to either of them it’s filtered to google.<br>
It’s ironic actually, because they have a no flame rule, and EVERYONE breaks that.</p>

<p>take this from one of the people who helped ‘create’ the revolutions over at RL: everyone there is pretty fucking retarded<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>There are a lot of alleged “retards” here. Calling them a direct retard is an insult to the actual mentally ill.[/quote]<br>
the implication of calling someone a retard does in fact imply they are mentally handicapped.<br>
when we say retard we mean retard.</p>
