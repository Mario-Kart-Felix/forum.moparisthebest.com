Welcome to Menacescape 508 beta. I released the beta, i know the server still new but i like it that members get the feeling and report all the bugs they find. I started this project on 1/14/09

The intergrating in the website + server will be released after beta, or a little before. I think it was better because i don&#39;t think alot of members likes to register so i thought let them play and everything until i finish beta.

To beta - You must use the client.

Download link : [url=http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?nny22kmxqzj]http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?nny22kmxqzj[/url]

The web client will be added soon so members can use that, the client will be needed until then. You don&#39;t add the Cache508 folder in the &quot;C:&quot;, it already inside the client so it will be loaded from the client folders.

Thanks.</description>
