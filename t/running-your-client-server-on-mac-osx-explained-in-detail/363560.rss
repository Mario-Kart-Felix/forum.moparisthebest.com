    <title>Running Your Client/Server on Mac OSX [Explained in Detail]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/running-your-client-server-on-mac-osx-explained-in-detail/363560</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, so I have heard a couple people have been having problems running their clients &amp; servers on Mac.
Today I will show you all how to run/setup your client and server for Mac.

[size=18pt]Client:[/size]

[b]1.[/b] Macintosh Computers come with Java pre-installed, so no need for setting up Classpath and Path.
[b]2.[/b] We will start by going to &#39;Spotlight&#39; shortcut: command+space.
[b]3.[/b] Type in &quot;Terminal&quot;, and open it.
[b]4.[/b] Type in &quot;cd&quot; when the prompt comes up.
[b]5.[/b] Go to your clients folder and drag the folder icon to the terminal window
[b]6.[/b] Press &#39;Enter&#39;.

What we have done so far is changed the directory to your clients folder in order to start running it.

There is now multiple ways to run and compile your client here are two:
[b]7a.[/b] Start by typing in the following to run your client: &#39;java client 10 0 highmem members 32&#39; and press enter.
[b]7aa.[/b] Type this in to compile your client: &quot;javac *.java&quot; and press enter.

[b]7b.[/b] Second way is way easier than above and is great for packaged clients:
Start by opening &#39;Textedit&#39; and converting your text from .rtf to .txt by pressing: &#39;command+shift+t&#39; and paste/type the following: [code]cd bin
java -Xmx512m client[/code] 
now for both you may replace the part where it says &#39;client&#39; with JFrame, Launcher, etc.
That code will run your client. Save it as &#39;run.bash&#39;. Remove the &#39;cd bin&#39; for unpackaged clients.

[b]7bb.[/b] Do the same steps as above but instead of pasting/typing that code input this one:
[code]javac -cp . -d ./bin/ ./src/*.java ./src/sign/*.java[/code]
this will compile your client if your client is packaged.
[code]javac *.java[/code]
the one above will compile unpackaged but with the bash file. Save it as &#39;Compile.bash&#39;

[b][DO THIS PART IF YOU HAVE MADE .bash FILES]:[/b]
Now that we have made .bash files all we have to do now is go into terminal and type: &#39;bash&#39; and drag your run or compile file into terminal and press enter.

[size=18pt]Server:[/size]
Running/Compiling your server is about as easy as running/compiling your client.

[b][NOTE]: IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU USE AN IDE FOR COMPILING YOUR SERVER![/b]

[b]1.[/b] Start by opening up Textedit and converting from .rtf to .txt (shortcut: command+shift+t)
[b]2.[/b] Paste/Type this code: [code]javac *.java[/code]
[b]3.[/b] Save it as &#39;Compile.bash&#39;
[b]4.[/b] Open up &#39;Terminal&#39; and set the directory to your server by typing &#39;cd&#39; and dragging your server folder in.
[b]5.[/b] Than type &#39;bash&#39; and drag your Compile.bash into &#39;Terminal&#39; and press Enter.

[b]6.[/b] Convert your Textedit format to .txt
[b]7.[/b] Paste/Type this code: [code]java server[/code]
[b]8.[/b] Save it as &#39;Run.bash&#39;
[b]9.[/b] Your directory should still be on your server folder.
[b]10.[/b] Type &#39;bash&#39; and drag &#39;Run.bash&#39; into &#39;Terminal&#39; and press Enter.

[size=18pt]Running Multiple Terminals At Once:[/size]
[b]1.[/b] This is a simple thing but just to make sure people know.
[b]2.[/b] Right Click &#39;Terminal&#39; (hopefully its on your dock, if not drag it there).
[b]3.[/b] Go to &#39;New Window&#39;.
[b]4.[/b] Click &#39;Basic&#39;.

[size=18pt]Opening Multiple Finder Windows:[/size]
[b]1.[/b] Right Click &#39;Finder&#39;.
[b]2.[/b] Click &#39;New Finder Window&#39;
