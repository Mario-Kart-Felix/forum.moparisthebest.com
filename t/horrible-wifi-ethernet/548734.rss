    <title>Horrible Wifi/Ethernet</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/horrible-wifi-ethernet/548734</link>
    <description>Does anyone know why a router with a 300mbps speed and a ISP with a promised 75mbps speed fails to download/upload past a 200kbps speed? I&#39;ve upgraded the firmware, turned off any devices that use WiFi, changes plenty router specifications, and even tried google for my help. My router isn&#39;t upgradeable to DD-WRT, which really sucks :mad:

My average download speed is around 70-110kbps and on a really really good day 200kbps. Would anyone know why a download/upload speed can be this horrible?

My modem is right beside the computer on a wooden stand with no other devices.</description>

<p>My ISP has given me this router just 2 months ago (ReadyNet WRT-500, 2.4GHz, 801.11g), and I have recently updated my firmware. My current connection speed is 150mbps, so I don’t understand AT ALL why in the world this connection could be so slow.</p>

<p>ReadyNet looks like some off brand routers (I’m judging by their website…). <a href="http://www.readynetsolutions.com/products/wrt500-wireless-n-router-with-tr-069/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.readynetsolutions.com/products/wrt500-wireless-n-router-with-tr-069/</a><br>
That’s what I found when trying to look for information in your router, but they really didn’t provide much. I also found a setup guide and the directory is in a wordpress folder… So I mean, they probably aren’t that good if they’re using wordpress… <a href="http://www.readynetsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/WRT500-QIG_140520_0900.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.readynetsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/WRT500-QIG_140520_0900.pdf</a> (They could have used it in the past and never updated the folder… idk but still).</p>
<p>I think your next step would be bitching to your isp about your speeds. That’s really the only way I get my shit fixed if it does go down.<br>

The way the website looks shouldn’t matter; the way the specs are should. The price of this router was $60, and that’s a pretty good price range for what the router offers.[/quote]<br>
If they cannot afford a ‘premium’ website (one not built off an existing engine… like wordpress) do you really think they can afford quality parts?</p>

<p>If you want to advertise out a product, you’re not going to want to make the source of the product (e.g. advertising on a website) look like complete shit would you? Either or, if you are having problems with the router or ISP itself, call them for like the fourth time being told lmao.</p>
<p>They obviously must have given you a defected router, or it simply was a mishap or something. I’m not sure what else to tell you besides to call them.</p>
