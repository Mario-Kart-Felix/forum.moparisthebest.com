    <title>Project 07 | Eco | 317</title>

    Project 07 has been in development since 2010. We started with a completely blank base with the revision of 317. Many features have been added, including almost every NPC. Our home is Edgeville, where you can trade, merchant, or simply hang out there. Every single dupe has been patched, so don&#39;t even try it. Advertising, flaming, or excessive spamming, will result in a mute, or ban.
    The countless hours that have been put into this server by our development team, has finally paid off, as we are finally releasing this server for everyone to play, as of 8/10/2013. We hope that we can gain a lot of popularity through out the years that we run.
    We are also currently raising money for a custom domain, and a higher quality VPS. We would all be very grateful if anyone donates. Donation prices will be in our forums. A price list will also be implemented in our forums.
    If you have any questions, please contact us in-game, or via our email.
        Thank you for visiting! Enjoy!
