    <title>Too many players help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/too-many-players-help/248117</link>
    <description>Ok I&#39;ve just dealt with it in the past but it&#39;s getting really annoying now. How do I fix the &quot;too many players&quot; error that seems to disconnect random people upon another player&#39;s login. I believe it has to do with a discrepancy between the server and the client sent/received data, and I believe it&#39;s a server-side fix. Anyone got a solution?</description>
