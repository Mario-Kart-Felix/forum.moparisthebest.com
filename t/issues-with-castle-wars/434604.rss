    <title>Issues with castle wars</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/issues-with-castle-wars/434604</link>
    <description>Recently I have begun development of a shard based server, and have been working on castle wars. However, I have some issues with the clicking of the staircase next to the zammy spawn. None of the other stairs on the server give me an issue at all.

If the player is standing in one of the spaces marked green, the stairs work, however in the red spaces the stairs don&#39;t work, and the player walks to the place right next to the bottom of the stairs (2372,3126 and height 1). Does anybody know what to do to eliminate this problem? 
The object&#39;s location is 2369, 3126. The player in the picture is standing at 2373, 3126, height 1.</description>
