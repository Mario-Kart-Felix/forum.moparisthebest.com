    <title>The Start Of Java-programming</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-start-of-java-programming/451689</link>
    <description>Hello guys,

Basically I&#39;m stuck in a dilemma, I&#39;ve been wanting to get into Java programming for almost 2 years but for some reason I can&#39;t seem to understand it. I&#39;ve read many tutorials on the forums to actually see if its sticking but its not at all. This is why I&#39;ve resorted in asking you all what I could do now? Do you know of any other places I can explore; even the basics I&#39;m not fussed, just anything. My dream would be to own my 317 RSPS with a thriving community, but my chances at the moment are pretty much slim to none. Any advice/help will be much appreciated.

Many thanks.</description>

<p>However he actually makes them in a professional manor, unlike most of the video tutorials I’ve seen, plus he also tries to explain it in terms that the average person without a ton of computer knowledge can understand.  It also seems better than buying a book, the 3 books I’ve seen (one belonging to me and the other two to a friend) just kind of expect you to know allot about programming prior to reading, witch the OP clearly doesn’t.</p>

Isn’t that what I recommended from the beginning? -.-  I learned 80% of what I know about both programming and <a href="http://VB.net" rel="nofollow noopener">VB.net</a> from the videos thenewboston was hosting on his channel for someone.</p>

              <p>Look at code snippets, both in the source and on here from tutorials.  I personally can’t explain how to observe code, you just do it.</p>
<p>I learned by just looking at code snippets, adding them in my source, and then I got curious to see what something actually did when I added it.</p>
<p>For example, look at this</p>
<p><code>if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase("slots")){
            int hasitem = 25000000;
            int slot = (Misc.random(100));
            int risked = (hasitem * 2);
            if (!c.getItems().playerHasItem(995, hasitem)) {
            c.sendMessage("You havent got above "+hasitem+" gp in your inventory.");
            return;
            }
            if (slot == 11 || slot == 22 || slot == 33 || slot == 44 || slot == 55 || slot == 66 || slot == 77 || slot == 88 || slot == 99) {
                    c.sendMessage("You pulled slotmachine and got "+slot+" You won "+(risked/1000000)+"M.");
                    c.getItems().addItem(995, risked);
            } else {
                    c.sendMessage("You pulled slotmachine and got "+slot+" You lost 25m.");
                    c.getItems().deleteItem(995, c.getItems().getItemSlot(995), hasitem);
    }
    }</code><br>
This is a command that adds a bare-bones ‘slot machine’ though commands.<br>
Knowing that the item code for gold is 995, you can infer that any parts of the code with 995 in it have something to do with adding or removing gold.</p>
<p>But I’m no expert in Java, so you could try watching these<br>
<a href="http://thenewboston.org/list.php?cat=31" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://thenewboston.org/list.php?cat=31</a><br>
He’s quite good at teaching the basics.</p>

<p>Buy a Java book, or torrent an e-book. Most of the youtube tutorials are bad, you can also try to create a simple program to kind of grasp the basics, i.e:<br>
Create a simple program that prints numbers and text on screen.</p>
