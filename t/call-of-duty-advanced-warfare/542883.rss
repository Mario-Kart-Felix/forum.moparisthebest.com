    <title>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/542883</link>
    <description>Who here liked Ghosts? I&#39;m guessing like one of you out of two hundred reading.
Well, Infinity Ward isn&#39;t making the next game due to their huge failure.[b] Sledgehammer is.[/b]
The game is being called Advanced Warfare, and from the looks of it, it&#39;s going to be a huge improvement from Ghosts, and will probably bring COD back into popularity.

What do you guys think about this? Is this going to be a big failure like Ghosts, or do you think it has potential?</description>

I’ve played a decent amount of DayZ and I can’t disagree with that, it’s got so many awesome features and it’s pretty powerful it’s just glitchy and almost unplayable at times with the shitty collision detection, frame lag, and other such things.</p>

[/quote]Yeah, Battlefield is definitely not a war simulator, ARMA is as close to a war sim as you’re going to get.

You can’t hold a beta 2 weeks before a release of a game and expect everything to be finished.  Hardline was pushed back for a 2015 release date, so I think EA is starting to learn their lessons about releasing an unfinished game.</p>
<p>I really don’t like call of duty, and probably never will unless they go back to the world war 2 setting.  Even if DICE made a WW2 game again, I’d play the fudge out of it.  The original BF games were fantastic (same with MOH and COD) when they were a lot more simple.  Hell, even the BC2 Vietnam pack was fudgeing fantastic.  I just think all this modern shit is stupid.  BF4 and BFH are probably going to be the last games in the BF franchise based in the near-future.  All the games after that will probably take place 50 years from now, which I think is an overused concept for a FPS.  Again, if DICE made a WW2 game with the latest frostbite tech, I’d buy the shit out if it.[/quote]</p>

<p>Nope. They take it in turns. Notice how the games are released alternately: IW, Treyarch, IW, Treyarch. This year wouldn’t be IW’s anyway.<br>

<p>In 2014 it has been confirmed that Sledgehammer Games are producing the 2014 title and will instead of the two year rotation between Infinity Ward and Treyarch, there will be a three rotation starting from Infinity Ward (2013), Sledgehammer Games (2014), and Treyarch (2015).</p>

<p>Personally, I only ever enjoyed MW2 (my first), which may have been due to the fact that it was the only game me and all of my friends played consistently (the others were on and off). I recall the good times of 2v5 beating a clan (FuN) in S&amp;D with my buddy while he always watched south park in the background![/quote]</p>

<p>On topic, why do people have to jump on the bandwagon for hating on the COD series for? They’ve all been decent and the main focus of course is going to be multi-player. However this release doesn’t seem like the standard COD multiplayer that I’ve come accustomed too, it seems to get more and more fast paced every game, still curious to see how it turns out. My favorite multiplayer modes from the COD series have to be WaW, MW3, and BO2.</p>

              <p>I always buy every CoD release regardless of how shitty it is, I always have since I started playing (started playing on GameCube)</p>
<p>I always get my moneys worth out of it and I get criticized for playing such a garbage game, which it is. But I enjoy it. Isn’t that why we play games, to have fun? Every Call of Duty thread ever that has always been that one person who doesn’t like it and has to say something. Who cares? We all play to have fun, if I didn’t like the game I wouldn’t buy it. I’m sure the majority feel the same.</p>
<p>Rant over; anyway, hopefully this CoD is actually enjoyable for more than 5 months, it looks promising. New developer, new story. They can take it down any path they want. I hope they chose the right one.</p>
