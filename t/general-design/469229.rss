    <description>What sort of design are we looking for? Pseudo code would be helpful; I&#39;ve never had to write something like this so I need a place to start :D

Are we going to just try and like extend the packet handlers, so if someone was writing a herblore plugin:
[code=pseudo]
//@authors bob, joe, josh
//@manager susan

public class Herblore extends GenericPlugin {
 
 VARIABLES AND STUFF 

 void register() { //all genericplugins have this
    scriptmanager.register(herbloreitemonitem, Hooks.ItemonItem) //adds a hook to the script manager
    scriptmanager.register(herbloreitemclick, Hook.ItemClick)
 }

 class herbloreitemonitem extends itemonitemscript { //could also use reflection and replace these classes with just methods
   @Override
   boolean run(Player p, itemid1, itemid2 etcetc) {
    //mixing potions and stuff
   }
 }

 class herbloreitemclick extends itemclickscript {
   @Override
   boolean run(Player p, itemid, slot) {
    //cleaning herbs and stuff
   }
 }
[/code]
Or did you guys have something else in mind

Basically then all we&#39;d have to do is add a new folder to the build path and dynamically load that folder on startup. I think this would be the easiest way at least, and wouldn&#39;t take very long to develop. However I could be completely misunderstanding what you guys mean when you say API! My understanding is basically the classes we would need to write the code above, and then also just give them easy access to some methods.</description>

<p>The only thing I can think of for that is something like a HashMap, or a Properties object for each player. Then they can set whatever extra values there. When the player logs out, those properties are saved as well.</p>
<p>Also, perhaps if a certain feature is used enough, that is stored in the Properties object, we could move it outside as an actual field.</p>

              <p>Yes that’s what I was saying. (the itemonitemscript is just what I meant by itemonitemaction) But in the case of items, there is nothing wrong with having multiple listeners for multiple items. However, in Osiris it looks like you only need to look for a primary item id also in this case. For example:</p>
<p>[quote=“zyle1992, post:2, topic:469229”]<code>
	ItemActionListeners.register(new GrindItemListener(), PESTLE_MORTAR);
	ItemActionListeners.register(new PotionMixListener(), WATER_VIAL, UNFINISHED POTIONS);
</code>[/quote]And then the PotionMixListener has the information about the rest. Basically just make sure that ONE of the items used is in that first list.</p>
<p>But yea that’s somewhat off topic I just mean general design <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Well, every handler should probably implement the appropriate ActionListener, so for items, have something like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class GrindItemListener implements ItemActionListener {

	@Override
	public onItemAction(final ItemOnItemAction action) {
		// do default checking, has item and such
		getGroundItem(action.getItemUsed());

<p>Then just register it in whatever scripting language we decide, like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	ItemActionListeners.register(new GrindItemListener(), PESTLE_MORTAR, CLEANED_GUAM, CLEANED_TARROMIN, ...);</code></pre>
<p>But then you run into multiple listeners for multiple items</p>
