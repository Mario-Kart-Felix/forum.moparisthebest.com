    <description>Problem with barrows

I&#39;m using DeltaScape source and am trying to make runescape style barrows.
I have set the barrow kills to save into the character file as they should so
that players rounds can save.

One problem is that after killing a barrow brother you cannot summon it again
how ever if you log out and back in you can summon it once again...

My code to stop that is this

[code]
if(objectID == 6821){
if (Ahrimkill &gt; 0) {
sM(&quot;You have already defeated Ahrim.&quot;);
} else
server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2025, 3557, 9700, heightLevel);[/code]

Is there something I&#39;ve missed out ?</description>
