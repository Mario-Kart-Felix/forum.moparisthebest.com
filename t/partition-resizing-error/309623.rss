    <title>Partition resizing error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/partition-resizing-error/309623</link>
    <description>i have a dual boot setup on my laptop. on one partition i have windows xp sp3 installed and on the other partition i have ubuntu 9.04

my winxp partition contains 80 GB and my ubuntu partition contains 40 GB. today, i tried to resize my windows partition to 60 GB and my ubuntu partition to 25 GB in order to create a 35 GB partition. i did all of this using paragon

so paragon told me to restart computer because win partition was in use, etc. so when i restart it boots into paragon and starts doing everything as it usually would. after a few minutes of running however, i receive an error message as follows: &quot;Some error occurred. File system has allocation errors due to cross linked files...&quot; then it exits paragon and restarts my computer, leaving the partitions as they were without creating new partition

help

[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 20, 2009, 02:38:50 pm[/size][hr]thanks for the lack of help, but i have fixed this through running CHKDSK on my windows partition. turns out, a trojan i was infected with a couple of days ago created files that pointed to data-clusters that were already in use, and thus fucking my FAT up

this can be locked now</description>
