        <p>again, then what exactly is the point?</p>
<p>[quote=“Vain_, post:35, topic:530060”][quote author=Davidi2 link=topic=648817.msg4362466#msg4362466 date=1379022933]<br>
I think the part Vain isn’t grasping when we think it’s a bad idea is that there’s a difference between abusing your power and using it incorrectly. Someone given locking power with an award doesn’t necessarily have to abuse their power to use it incorrectly, locking topics that maybe don’t need to be locked because they have bad judgement on that front. Does that mean they need to lose the award they earned because of it? No, it shouldn’t really. The problem with the suggestion is that there really is just no correlation at all between getting an award and being trusted/able to know what topics to lock in a board. The only arguments I see are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It helps reduce the workload on moderators.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it? If you give someone the ability to lock just because they are good at drawing or java, can you trust them to lock the correct topics all the time? No not really, and you end up having to have actual moderators double check the locks the person makes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It gives badges another purpose.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Do they need another purpose? Right now they do exactly what they are designed to do, and I don’t think there’s any reason to change the definition of a badge here.</li>
</ul>
<p>[/quote]1: badge wouldnt need to be stripped unless its purposely abused. if they misunderstand when a topic should be locked, a staff member can help them out. if they continually misusing it, they lose the lock option.<br>
staff wouldn’t have to double check anything. if someone feels a topic was locked incorrectly, it can be reported.</p>
<p>admins don’t double check when globals lock something<br>
and globals dont double check when sectionals lock something<br>
why would anyone have to double check an awarded user?[/quote]You’re overcomplicating it… now we have awarded users that can lock topics and awarded users that can’t lock topics too, that’s confusing to the average user and makes no sense when they just see someone with an award locking their topic. When you give people permission to lock you are giving them authority.</p>
<p>Again: what exactly is the difference between someone with an award and a random active member when it comes to locking topics in a section? Why should the person with the award be the one that has the power?</p>
<p>The point is, by doing this change you tie power to an award, and nobody wants to do that. Sometimes awards are given once someone has acquired authority, like the green and blue stars, it shouldn’t be the other way around.</p>

        <p>I personally do not see anything confusing with his suggestion, at all; and I agree with it.</p>
<p>Giving users’ with awards the ability to lock topics within their field (what they got the badge for) that are not relevant to the section. i.e: someone making a topic within Server Help regarding a download request, some user that has earned the Server Helper badge could lock the topic and tell the user that you can request downloads in the appropriate section.</p>
<p>I don’t see the big deal, if the user wants to help they can help, if they don’t want to help then they do not have to. The user received the badge for meeting requirements of that award, the award should <em>not</em> represent sectional moderator or any of the affirmative, the suggestion is aimed at lessening the workload of the staff. I know the global moderators do <em>not</em> moderate every section on this forum at any given time. Typically a “Server Helper” would be most active in the Server Help section, a Java Guru would be most active in the General Programming section, a Tutorial Author would be most active in the tutorial/snippet section.</p>

<ol>
<li>It doesn’t take someone with an award to know that a download topic doesn’t go in the server help section. Any active member knows this.</li>
<li>Not only that, but because they couldn’t move the topic (which sectionals could), it does create more meaningless work for the rest of the team.</li>
<li>“If the user wants to help” can be applied to any user, doesn’t have to be a badge holder.</li>
<li>I have a java programming badge but that does not mean I am very active in general programming (at least relatively, seeing as I am a pretty active member), nor does Arham visit tutorials more than the average user, and just based off your recent post history, the same probably applies to you and the help section.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why should a badge holder be given this power over any active user that also has the mindset to help?</p>

<p>2: you understand how many times people post “wrong section” and the user posts in the right section + topic is moved; now two topics needing to be merged + the shadow topic is there.<br>

<p>4: regardless of where the users main posting areas are. the amount of help it could provide is worth the suggestion, and is a whole lot easier than promoting new members to sectional[/quote]1. What? What does that have to do with having a badge? An awarded user doesn’t necessarily check more than a normal user. And again even then a sectional could do the same job.<br>
2. Correct, if people with badges had to lock topics and then get moved it would have 3 topics instead of 2. Which is why it’s better to just have sectionals move the topic rather than have it locked as well. Do you know how obnoxious it is to have to recreate a post you may have put some time into if you can’t see the BBC for it (you cant view the BBC for a post you’ve made if it’s locked)? Again, this complicates it for no reason.<br>
3. Yes, believe it or not power here is given once people are deemed worthy of holding it. That’s not too much to ask. However with my suggestion, those standards would be lowered quite a bit and made a lot easier. It’d pretty much be people offering to help moderate a section, and it’d only be a no if the person wasnt very active, had a bad history, or was new. Any average or above average user could have a shot at being sectional.<br>
4. I agree that there should be an easier way for topics to get taken care of (deleted, locked, moved, or whatever), but I completely disagree that tying it in with badges is the correct option.</p>

        <p>1: when i had my badge, i would report multiple topics and wait upwards of a few hours to have it dealt with ~ even with staff online.<br>
i know it is still the same (mostly for server help/tutorials; with the occasional in general programming board)</p>
<p>2: how would that be three topics? either the baged user says “repost in x section” and locks it; user can repost it. if a staff member wants to move it, he moves and unlocks. there’s no need to move it however, because the user was told to post in the right section. this goes along with the shadow topic suggestion. <span class="bbcode-b">the topic will remain in the wrong section, and show the user it is locked, and they can see why. it also still says it was posted by them. a shadow topic says the author is the moving moderator which can cause confusion.</span></p>
<p>3: why lower the standards of being a staff member? that sounds horrible.</p>
<p>4: so we should just add more sectionals ~what you said in your suggestion -&gt; that have more actions to use, ie punish, lock, delete, modify, etc ; and could easily be abused if given to the wrong person - its not hard to suck up for a while and ‘apply’ to be staff, then go apeshit. IE tarkoff.</p>

        <p>I do however think the whole idea ruins the concept of a ‘badge’. For example, someone is not given the Noble Prize and then has a duty to moderate all book-makers. Why? Because people are nominated to be moderators for a reason. You could give me a badge, but have me running around being the 12 year old I am. <span class="bbcode-i">When the power comes to you, you have no idea what you’ll do with it.</span> That’s at least my side of the argument.</p>
<p>Think about it, awards are similar to ‘prizes’. Giving powers from the ‘prizes’ are sort of strange to do. And not to mention, you do say that they still have to be approved by a moderator to see if the topic should be locked. Wouldn’t that still make the same workload applied onto moderators?</p>

Well, not trying to degrade your motivation but I just think the idea would fail. Not all badged members are mature enough to handle it… Also who said they have agreed upon moderating the forum?<br>
P.S badged members can be biased and not everybody who is appointed a staff position is fair. That’s you make sure you appoint all the right peoples.<br>
staff are chosen for a reason, its because they have shown their maturity and experience. (well some) Well, they do have credibility.<br>
Like arham said, if Lil Wayne gets a grammy… and him running the entire music industry… spells disaster.</p>

        <p>I understand your concerns for more staff but that’s why there are badges AND staff positions(as 2 different things). staffs with a java guru label and a staff label. The other have made good points. Appointed staff is less biased and less of a hassle(hand picked by the staff members). Because it would be easier to lure out the wolf out of the sheep pack. If a badged member so happens to not like a persons topic… just for the sake of not liking it. Then the person questions all the admins and moderators asking ‘why the hell is my topic locked?’ And before you know it… the staff gives the badge member a second chance and it will be a bigger workload for the staff.<br>
EDIT: Why do you want this change so bad anyways? (you don’t have a badge)</p>
