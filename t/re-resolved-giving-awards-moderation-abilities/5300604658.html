If it does, whatever, wont need a modification</p>

you’re stating LETS MAKE MORE MODS<br>
im debating on WHY MAKE MORE MODS WHEN WE CAN USE WHAT WE HAVE</p>
<p>you’re stating AWARDS SHOULD ONLY BE COSMETIC<br>
im debating GIVE THE AWARDED MEMBERS OPTIONS TO HELP</p>
<p>you’re stating SECTIONAL MODERATOR CAN BE OPT-IN AND ANYONE CAN APPLY TO DO IT<br>
im debating USE THE AWARDS TO BE THE OPT-IN RATHER THAN APPLYING</p>
<p>clearly you can comprehend what im saying<br>
[/quote]Do you not see the difference between talking about adding more mods and talking about users that can ‘lock topics’? You said it yourself they aren’t the same as sectionals. So even if we put your idea in place, I would still have my idea to add more mods, which is why it’s a different idea. There is no link between the two except the fact that in yours they share ONE power with sectionals. Also I only even said awards should be cosmetic in reply to you, my topic is NOT ABOUT AWARDS</p>
<p>Edit - was split anyways, nevermind. feel free to discuss your idea lol[/quote]how is it completely different? you want more mods when we can use who we have to do the same job.</p>
<p>also, as for your last comment; smf mods wouldn’t be needed?</p>
<p>&lt;Add memberground: by type “moderator”&gt;</p>
<p>edit permissions of group<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/bv927cp.png" alt width="161" height="81"><br>
to only allow users to LOCK topics</p>
<p>then apply the users to that memberground, then append them to the board, like you would any other sectional moderator.</p>

<p>allowing users who were awarded in that section to only LOCK topics in that section could lift the workload stress a lot.</p>

Why give them power when a couple sectionals will work.[/quote]if all the staff members/ex staff members admit to “doing a lot of work at first, then barely doing anything” why would we make more?</p>
<p>the staff list doesn’t need to be bumped up more and more, especially with having inactive staff members on the forums.</p>
<p>the award is given to people who staff feel worthy<br>
sectional is given to people who staff feel worthy + accept to be one.</p>
<p>why not automatically give the awarded users the ability to help with the workload of that section (bringing the need for sectionals down in number) and allow insight on said user becoming sectional/global.</p>
<p>the current state of moderators is staff boards, and someone just nominates a user, and all the staff vote/debate; correct?</p>
<p>this method would allow an easier way in determining who gets a shot at being mod.<br>
also, would strip their badge away after being promoted, and give the illusion of the award being hard to get as less people have it, giving more people the want to earn it.</p>

        <p>I think the part Vain isn’t grasping when we think it’s a bad idea is that there’s a difference between abusing your power and using it incorrectly.
