    <description>[quote=&quot;Arcik, post:4, topic:530056&quot;]I think we should have like after a thread gets reported x amount of times for it to automatically be locked then reviewed by a staff member. I guess that would make their lives easier? 

I think we should have different/more active staff members.[/quote]or have the &#39;awards&#39; actually be somewhat helpful in the community

web developer awards -&gt; ability to lock topics in the web dev section

tutorial authors -&gt; ability to lock topics in the tutorials/snippets section, and move topics to&amp;from as needed

server helpers -&gt; ability to lock topics in server help.

all programming badges -&gt; ability to lock topics in the programming section (could possibly be broken down to sub sections if said language ever got popular enough)


this would make the award meaningful, allow insight to see if above users are worthy of being staff, and lessen the work load of the actual staff members</description>

              <p>We have a staff team for this, which now comprises of a lot more sectionals. I don’t think an award qualifies anyone for a position of power (no matter how small) and if it did they would already be sectional (assuming we needed the extra member of course). That’s it really.</p>

<p>i honestly don’t see why everyone keeps saying it’s just the same as making them moderators. if a simple lock doesn’t help anything, why not prune all locked topics and lose 75% of the forums posts?</p>

<p>Let me ask you this: why should the awarded members be allowed to lock but not delete or move?</p>
<p>All 3 are easily reversible (recycle bin, re-moving, unlocking), logged, would help the staff teams ‘work load’, and not too dangerous. The only answer is “because that would make them seem too much like moderators”, which is the only thing this entire idea revolves around. You want people to have mod powers without having to show they are capable of handling them.</p>
