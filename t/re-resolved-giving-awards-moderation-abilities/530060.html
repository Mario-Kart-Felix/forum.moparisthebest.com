<p>I think we should have different/more active staff members.[/quote]be right back getting on my three accounts to report this thread <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>&lt;3 you just kidding</p>
<p>[hr]<br>
[hr]</p>
<p>Okay so I feel very similar about the staff…</p>
<p>I know I have had my…let’s use the word differences with the staff over the past two years and certain topics we will never agree with point blank.</p>
<p>However, I do see there being room to improve on the way the staff team works, how it operates, how it’s shown as a whole, and what who can do.</p>
<p>First off I don’t know what the staff board looks like, however from personal conversations I hear there is a great detail of information in there about what to do in certain situations, discussions about specific users, discussions about certain topics etc etc blah blah all that. Here is how I am thinking about it should be set up and it would be great if the staff could tell how it could be improved upon. Just because you aren’t the boss doesn’t mean you can’t make the big changes!</p>
<p>Staff board<br>
–F.A.Q. / etc<br>
–All staff lounge(I can only be under the assumption that sectionals have no need to have access to topics directly about users, but only about requests for sectional bans and etc. I don’t even see a need for them to have any major decision powers such as discussion on suggestions etc in private. I see the sectional position as an “in between” group. They tell the administration when certain players are stating this and for this reason, or they give suggestions on how their responsibilities/sections can be improved.)<br>
–Gmod +(user discussions/suggestion discussions are posted here for the administration and gmods to discuss with each other. gmods of course have access to the sectional group as well. )<br>
–Admin +(Any private admin discussions, html access for test messages, developer consoles, whatever else )<br>
–Trash?</p>
<p>I found this topic while searching for a current staff list I think it speaks for itself not sure fi this really true or not though either as nobody confirmed/denied it!</p>

<p>I believe it was Ruby who actually said something ( and this is paraphrasing) but that we need to “get the staff section active”</p>
<p>What should a staff member really be? What should their duties include?</p>
<ol>
<li>Sectionals. As stated above I see a sectional as sort of like an in-between person. They are responsible for gathering process improvements from the community for their section, to make reports about certain people when needed, to help moderate and to clean their section as seen fit, and to help get the gmods attention when needed in their section.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Gmods - gmods are like the big brother or the “pastor” of the sectionals. They have been in the game for a while now and are experienced enough to know what to do in what situations. They are responsible for looking over all actions done by sectionals and performing maintenance as seen fit to improve upon a sectionals actions. They are also responsible for supplying feedback to the administration to help keep the larger picture in mind.<br>
Admins - not much to say here they do what they want lol…but no seriously they develop, over look the forums as a whole, they are like the “IT Director” they do literally everything in their specific roles.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m pretty sure the way the power control works is already set up like this but if it isn’t I am listing it anyway so yeah… obviously sectionals can’t correct gmods corrections , and gmods can’t correct admins corrections. That’s about it there not much to say higher the rank the more baws you are.</p>
<p>About staff demotions…you know it’s hard to really and truly give an opinion on this. On one side of the coin you have a moderator such as… for example… reaper? He hasn’t been active since may however is an excellent veteran moderator and I am sure he will grace us once again one day. Can we say it’s fair that he loses his badge until he comes back? In a way, he did “earn” that position from being constructive in whatever he did to get the staffs attention. On the other side of the coin though it’s sort of like a private server who wants to be on a forum where there is going to be a ratio of like 7:4 replies in topics where 7 users and four of them are moderators of one kind or another. It just really depends on the way you look at it.</p>
<p>What sections really need sectionals? It’s sort of like setting up a payroll authority…except nobody is fortunate enough to get a paycheck(sorry!) The most four active sections I can think of that would ever need moderation would be server help ( none that I know of? ) , server adverts ( flame_ who does an excellent job! ), server downloads ( friddikins I think? ), and MAYBE general discussion as it has gotten kind of busy on there before and generally at least one noob will post in the wrong section on there. (I assume the admins monitor atm that section? )</p>
<p>Anyway sorry if this became too “tl;dr” style.</p>

<p>i never said someone couldn’t get an award due to attitudes. but you can’t be staff if you have a poor attitude!</p>
<p>only having the ability to LOCK topics is nowhere close to being the same as sectional, so perhaps you reread my pitch.</p>
<p>also, you shouldn’t blatantly say someone’s idea is retarded because you don’t agree with it. there’s no need to 1-5 staff members per section. especially since that’d be like all our daily-active users being mods</p>

I think we should have like after a thread gets reported x amount of times for it to automatically be locked then reviewed by a staff member. I guess that would make their lives easier?</p>
<p>I think we should have different/more active staff members.<br>
[/quote]or have the ‘awards’ actually be somewhat helpful in the community</p>
<p>web developer awards -&gt; ability to lock topics in the web dev section</p>
<p>tutorial authors -&gt; ability to lock topics in the tutorials/snippets section, and move topics to&amp;from as needed</p>
<p>server helpers -&gt; ability to lock topics in server help.</p>
<p>all programming badges -&gt; ability to lock topics in the programming section (could possibly be broken down to sub sections if said language ever got popular enough)</p>
<p>this would make the award meaningful, allow insight to see if above users are worthy of being staff, and lessen the work load of the actual staff members[/quote]tats good idea</p>

<p>im simply rebutting against your “1-5 mods per section”</p>
<p>this is a suggestion, and is called for community input/debate.<br>
if you cannot participate in the debate, don’t make suggestions.</p>

        <p>Your idea is completely irrelevant to my suggestion, I don’t say anything about other awards and if that’s what you took from my post you may want to re-read it. And I don’t see you rebutting anywhere about 1-5 mods per section? You just said ‘make awards meaningful’. And your idea doesn’t even affect what we would need in terms of staff if what you said is true about it being different than sectional, which is why I find it completely off topic.</p>
<p>Also your idea would require SMF modifications, so good luck with that.</p>

<p>clearly you can comprehend what im saying[/quote]Do you not see the difference between talking about adding more mods and talking about users that can ‘lock topics’? You said it yourself they aren’t the same as sectionals. So even if we put your idea in place, I would still have my idea to add more mods, which is why it’s a different idea. There is no link between the two except the fact that in yours they share ONE power with sectionals. Also I only even said awards should be cosmetic in reply to you, my topic is NOT ABOUT AWARDS</p>
<p>Edit - was split anyways, nevermind. feel free to discuss your idea lol</p>

As far as I know SMF already comes with a membergroup mod. Because badges such as server help and etc already come only on mcsp I am failing to see how there would be any conflicts with the current mod to change a membergroup permission to allow locking/unlocking his/or somebody else topic.</p>
