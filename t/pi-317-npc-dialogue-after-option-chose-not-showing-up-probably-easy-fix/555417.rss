    <title>[PI] 317 NPC Dialogue After Option chose Not showing up! (probably easy fix)</title>

    <description>Hey guys, so recently I started adding a few more NPCs into the game with intentions to add some dialogue that I would model my quest with. Here is what I have so far. I have dialogue that works fine, and options that work fine, but when I try to start dialogue back up from clicking an option, it doesn&#39;t show!
[SIZE=5]
[B]PROBLEM:[/B][/SIZE] In clickingbuttons, when the option from dialogue is chosen, everything works, except c.sendNPCDialogues(#, #) is not working and does not send dialgoue!


Here is my NPC that I spawned in spawn-config

[code]spawn = 252	3094	3471	0	0	0	0	0	Beggar	[/code]

Here is my dialogue cases for this NPC:

[code]		case 27:
			sendNpcChat4(&quot;Hey...&quot;,&quot;You&#39;re an adventurer, right...?&quot;,&quot;I may have something that you want...&quot;,&quot;Do you want me to tell you how to get it?&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Mysterious man&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 28;
			break;
		case 28:
			sendNpcChat4(&quot;So, the only catch is this:&quot;, &quot;The sword I will be giving you in the end&quot;, &quot;is very powerful, but only works&quot;, &quot;for those who have overcome a curse.&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Mysterious man&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 29;
			break;
		case 29:
			sendOption2(&quot;Tell me how to get it&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m not interested&quot;);
			c.dialogueAction = 11;
			break;
                case 30: //the case I want to appear when they choose the first option!
                        c.sendNpcChat1(&quot;Sounds good, I will tell you.&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Mysterious Man&quot;);
                        c.nextChat = 31;
                        break;[/code]

Then, in actionHandler to start the dialogue I have, under firstClickNPC: 
[code]
case 252:
		c.getDH().sendDialogues(27, npcType);
		break;
[/code]

The dialogue [b]works fine[/b], my only problem is, after they select an option, getting a dialogue to come back. Here is my clickingButtons for option 1 (&quot;Tell me how to get it&quot;) which gave me the ID of [COLOR=&quot;#FFFF00&quot;]9157[/COLOR]

[code]
case 9157: //tele to barrows tunnel
if (c.dialogueAction == 11) {
c.sendNpcDialogues(30, 252); //my next dialogue for the same NPC
}
//then the rest of the case, which I did not include
[/code]

The only thing about this is when it calls this case and the dialogueAction number, it doesn&#39;t send the dialogue. [b] I even tried putting a test there such as c.forcedChat(&quot;TEST&quot;); and even THAT showed up, but the sendDialogue doesn&#39;t show up.[/b] I also checked and 11 is not used as a dialogueAction anywhere. I know it is calling case 9157 @ dialogue action 11, but not sure why sendNpcDialogues isn&#39;t working.


If anyone could help me, it&#39;d be greatly appreciated. Will rep anyone who can help!</description>

<p>And yes, I see your “problem.”</p>
<p>It’s right here:</p>

<p>If you kept your code the same as what you originally posted in the first post, then this is your issue.</p>
<p>This would be why:</p>
<p><code>
if (c.dialogueAction == 11) {// The dialogueAction is 11. Therefore, it sends this dialogue
     c.sendNpcDialogues(30, 252); //my next dialogue for the same NPC
// Since there is no "break" or "return" here, the code continues to the next line(s). Since all your other code checks for other dialogues, it'll "skip" right to the bottom..
}
//AKA: this:
				c.dialogueAction = 0;// this sets your action back to 0.
				c.getPA().removeAllWindows();// and this closes any open window, including a dialogue. So your dialogue may be activating for a whole .05 of a second.
				break;</code>[/quote]</p>
<p>In the code I <em>just</em> posted, I copied the code after I took the dialogueAction == 11 statement out. I just was showing what was on there</p>
<p>I fixed it, though. Thanks for the help, man</p>

<p>Any problems with it that you see?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I added a forcedChat to see if the button was clicked and it was - the forcedChat worked but not the sendDialogues!</p>
