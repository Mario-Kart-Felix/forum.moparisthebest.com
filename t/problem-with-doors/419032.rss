    <title>Problem with doors</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-doors/419032</link>
    <description>i have all the code put in correctly, but my doors still aren&#39;t working like they should be.
i&#39;ve checked all the tutorials and threads, i did everything correctly, and they still don&#39;t work.
i believe i&#39;m working with a PI base, these are the codes that i have in:

doors.cfg -
[code]/**the door starts as closed
 South	 0 face =  		doorX -1 		face = -3
 East	-1 face = 		doorY -1 		face = 0
 North	-2 face = 		doorX +1		face = -1
 West	-3 face = 		doorY +1 		face = -2
*/
//door = xcoord	ycoord	height	face	shutoropen(0,1)    

//Lumbridge
door = 3234	3207	0	0	0	//regular door
door = 3244	3216	0	-2	0	//chapel big door

door = 2510	3380	0	-1	0      //this is the door i&#39;m trying to get to work
door = 2510	3380	0	0	1      //this is the same door, but in the open position

[ENDOFDOORLIST]
[/code]

and ActionHandler.java -
[code]case 1530:
		case 1531:
		case 1533:
		case 1534:
		case 11712:
		case 11711:
		case 11707:
		case 11708:
		case 6725:
		case 3198:
		case 3197:
			Server.objectHandler.doorHandling(objectType, c.objectX, c.objectY, 0);	
			break;
[/code]

As you can see, i have added a case for the correct door i&#39;m trying to use, 1530 (or 1531..but i have both added, and many other doors).  The bummer is that the doors worked earlier, and i stupidly changed a bunch of stuff and forgot to save a backup before hand haha.
Can anybody tell me what i&#39;m doing wrong?</description>
