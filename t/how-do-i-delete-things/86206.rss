    <title>How do I delete things</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-delete-things/86206</link>
    <description>How would I go about removing things? I would love to remove everything and build my own Runescape, just like that guy&#39;s alienscape. It looks amazing, how would I go about editing things like that.

Also if anyone knew how I could edit colors and edit names of items, that would be great.  

Perhaps I was a bit vague when I said things. I mean buildings.</description>
