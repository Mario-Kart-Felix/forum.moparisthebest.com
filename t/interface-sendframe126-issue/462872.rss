    <title>Interface. sendFrame126 issue?</title>

As you can see in the above image, there are multiple lines on each section of the interface.

I found the ID to change that section

But how do I make it carry on to the other lines like the one in the top right corner? Is there a certain method that makes it wrap round that box? Because when I&#39;m using sendFrame126, the text just carries on along one line. I was thinking it was a seperate id for each line but I&#39;ve been through about 40 different ids and none of them seem to be working.</description>
