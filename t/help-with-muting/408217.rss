    <title>Help With Muting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-muting/408217</link>
    <description>Hello!
I have successfully added music and sound effects to my server! I was wondering how I could add a mute button. I have downloaded a 317 deob, with 377 cache, with some edits (models, etc...). I am using a 317 game frame and I want to make a mute button. In Webber&#39;s client, you can view the id. So when I &#39;mouse&#39; over the off button I get the id 930. I hope that makes sense... here&#39;s a picture.



[IMG]http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/6062/id930.png[/img]


Now I have tried some ways to try to at least enable it. Like here&#39;s my code:


[code]		case 930:
		sendMsg(&quot;Stop no clipping!&quot;);
		break;[/code]
I put that just to see if I click on 930, it would say to &#39;Stop No Clipping&#39;. When I restarted (and compiled :D) and I clicked on the off button, it did nothing again. 


Now my question is, is there any way to mute the volume either by command or client button , or anything else?


I am using RichScape Source which is based off of Devolution v7/Dodian Source.


PS - Did I put the case 930, wrong? I put it by the yes emote which is id 168. Am I supposed to put it something else? Declare a void or something?


btw - I have both sounds and sound effects enabled. I would like at least sounds (city music) to be muted if chosen. Both would be nice though.


Thanks!</description>

<p>Ok once I do that, How would I enable it via button? or command? If your not busy, could you help me with the muting part? would I change this:</p>
<p><code>/**

                outStream.writeWordBigEndian(musicID);
        }</code></p>
<p>would I change the above to mute the city music? Just make it a negative somehow and declare it somewhere in client.java?<br>

No idea bro, try to play around with it, by counteracting it.[/quote]</p>
<p>Alright thanks for the help. At least I know what to do. Thanks! I appreciate it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
