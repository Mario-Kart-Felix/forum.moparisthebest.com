    <title>Jdk and Jre...wtf?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jdk-and-jre-wtf/288721</link>
    <description>I feel horrible for asking this but I recently got a new computer, and all the jdk and jre stuff I set for the servers are lost, and now I can&#39;t get them to work!

First off, I know for a FACT I have jdk 6 update 14, and jre update 14. My compiler (named build, but I think its a compiler) for my client I&#39;m trying to open says &quot;Cannot find the path specified.&quot;

This is what the compiler looks like (notepad):
[code]@echo off
Title (Name) Compiler
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_14\bin\javac.exe&quot; ./files/*.java
pause[/code]

In Environment Variables, this is my Path and Classpath:

Classpath: (is there a &quot;;&quot; missing after the 2nd bin?)
[code]C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_14\bin;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_14\bin[/code]


Path:
[code]C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_14\bin;[/code]

lastly, when I open the folder &quot;Java&quot; in program files, a file called jre6 is there. I don&#39;t know if that should be there, but you tell me. Thanks to anyone that helps.. Again I apologize for this question as I know it&#39;s been posted several times, but I&#39;ve searched and searched and tried several things and nothing is working.</description>
