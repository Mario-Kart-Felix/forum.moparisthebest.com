    <title>Mmm Log in Problem but not related to portfowarding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mmm-log-in-problem-but-not-related-to-portfowarding/221779</link>
    <description>When i first start up my server usually 1 person gets in but then others cant and they have to wait a few or a minute to log in and then later on it seems no one can log in anymore but the ones still in the server can play but when they log out and try to log in, they cant get in... is this related to my server.java or my client.java? Im using a czar base (allstartv2) and i can&#39;t seem to fix this problem. I tried to remove the ( foundz &gt; 3) part changing it to foundz &lt; 3 and removed it but its still the same problem... anyone know why is this or is it normal in czar bases?</description>

<p>i think theres a line of code somewhere in client.java that talks about the max number of connections, you could try changing that.</p>

<p>Trust me ive went almost thru the whole server.java and client.java for this problem i did change some stuff and seemed to help LITTLE but the majority is nothing changed in the log in process. I dont have a lock in my server.java and removed some stuff there that says you need some specific number of packets or w-e to accept. Anyone else who uses czar have any problems like this cause if not im thinking it is with my internet with this crappy comcast lol.</p>

              <p>if u ask me czar sucks… and well i wouldnt think its the max connections just becuz he said when sum1 logs out they cant get bak in… so if every1 logs no1 can get bak in… so i am guessing u have a lock on the server in ur server.java … check in there for it and remove it that way ur server wont ever lock.</p>
