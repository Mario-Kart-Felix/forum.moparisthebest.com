              <p>Hi.  I have had that problem before.  Its not that you have done anything wrong, its that you might not have the correct IP address.  If you are on a LAN (Local Area Network) you may have more people sharing your IP.  That can be fixed by simply calling your ISP and requesting your own IP.</p>
<p>Hope that helped!</p>
