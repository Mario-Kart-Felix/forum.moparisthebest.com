    <title>Player get black screen at logon help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-get-black-screen-at-logon-help/275538</link>
    <description>Hey. I used to never have this problem before, but recently I&#39;ve been getting a problem where if a new player joins the server, it will give them a black screen and they can&#39;t log out or play the game. This is what it shows.

[img]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/1420/blackscreenglitch.png[/img]

When I try and do a command to possibly teleport away, or if I use any command, I get this in my server window:

[code][client-11-nubnubnub]: playerCommand: starter
java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: -3
        at java.lang.String.substring(Unknown Source)
        at java.lang.String.substring(Unknown Source)
        at client.customCommand(client.java:11671)
        at client.parseIncomingPackets(client.java:23647)
        at client.packetProcess(client.java:18964)
        at client.packetSending(client.java:18917)
        at PlayerHandler.process(PlayerHandler.java:153)
        at server.main(server.java:53)
pimpscape Server [fatal] - exception
Game saved for player nubnubnub
ClientHandler: Client nubnubnub disconnected.[/code]

Can someone please help me? This is preventing new players to join my server......

EDIT: Now I just found out it doesn&#39;t black screen some people but it does for me and others. Also.. I can&#39;t use any commands. It disconnects me but some people can.</description>

runefreak10: Stfu flamers. Guy who needs help, what exactly are your problems with your ban command?<br>
Guy who’s smartass: He should just change sources.<br>
Smart man with 200 rep &amp; experienced who should have came in from the beginning before flame/spam occured: Rep don’t mean shit. So don’t speak. <em>Proceeds on with helping guy who needs help.</em><br>
Guy who’s Moderator: <em>warns guy with 10 rep and guy with 11 rep then continues on to leave without attempting help</em></p>

I’ve fixed the problem with the commands. But it still black screens me at logon. If I log in, I have a black screen but if I type ::train or something to teleport to train, then it fixes the black screen once teleported. How can I just fix it though…<br>

<p>In the login process, add something along the longs of this:<br>
code]if(absX == -1 &amp;&amp; absY == -1) {<br>
resetPos();<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p>That’s what I did, along with a resetpos command.<br>
Just add a method for the resetpos to set your x and y to your starting spot.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks, but I fixed my problem anyways. But I hate it how I make effort to help people on these forums and I get no replies to my help topics. So with that said, I back up your signature.</p>
