    <title>How Would you make?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-you-make/418982</link>
    <description>How can i make a game from scratch I mean because I was in geography and uhmm it randomly came to me to make a game that&#39;ll make some cash become very popular and get rid of WoW, RS and all the big names who think their better than us.

So my idea Was a game called FATAL™ thats where I made my user name for this forums and I thought This will be perfect for help on this project. I&#39;ve been looking for a terrain maker for this project so I can atleast start with making the floor. I have made a few weapons with, Meta but they look so crap and unproffesional so I might go into the Model&#39;s section and ask someone good at modelling to help me model some weapons. Well I thought of making something like a crossbreed, Sci-Fi , Medieval, and modern combat. This game will have two sides. One side The natives or Fatality, and the people that crash land on this planet on mistake and do not befriend the native&#39;s which cause a bad side and a good side.

The money will be based on Galactic coins, and the inventory will have 38 slot&#39;s and can carry item&#39;s there will also be a weaponry slot were you can carry your weapons in it for quick weaponry swap. The land will be like in the movie &quot;Avatar&quot; I mean think about it how epic will it be. So i need a how to and maybe some programmes to start me up.


Also I dunno if this belong&#39;s in this section :|</description>

Just ha and ha. First of all, if you manage to make a game with your current knowlegde wich you will not be able to do, you will NEVER, not even in your madest dreams, get anywhere NEAR runescape nor WoW.</p>
<p>Making a game is like bulding a building, it requires a lot of knowledge, discipline, accuracy, planning, time and money.<br>
You can’t build a skyscraper because you had an idea of making one.</p>
<p>Why don’t you start writing some hello world’s before making a game.</p>
<p>The only “game” you’re able to “make” are RSPS’s, wich basicly is copy &amp; paste.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>As most computer companies, Runescape was built by Andrew and his brother, Paul Gower.  The only 2 differences between FATAL and Paul is that FATAL seems as though he is lone-wolfing this project while Adrew was “assisted” by his brother. Also Runescape started out as a MUD then Graphics were" implemented early in development" making the MUD on release a Graphical MUD.</p>
<p>No offence FATAL but I do believe you should worry about either creating a single player game in whichever language you prefer. Then play around with sockets while creating a client from scratch. after the client is finished, then you should worry about implementing multiplayer capabilities.</p>
<p>Please excuse my horrible grammar, today is one of those off days.[/quote]I’m currently finishing a small game to get a budget for a larger MMORPGish game I have planned out and the first thing I have to do to that future project is networking. I don’t want to make a single player game and then convert it into multiplayer.</p>
<p>The networking would be too messy and possibly slow when you have to implement it later IMO.</p>
<p>It’s like getting stable networking, and then building the game. That way you won’t get unpleasent suprises.</p>
