    <title>508 cache directory :S</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-cache-directory-s/234672</link>
    <description>I made a topic in a forum but I didn&#39;t get pretty much help there.
I just copy the stuff here I need help with:

&quot;I have my own server and client. I want to send the client to my friends, but they have to download cache seperately. How can I do so that the Cache will be in my client files?
Not in C:\cache508\rs2 but in My Documents:\Client:\cache508\rs2 ... ???
FOR THAT I GOT MY ANSWER ... ALMOST!
This is in signlink.java
*/Do i have to use _ instead of space?
//{ &quot;c:/program files/messenger/508/508 RSPS/cache508/rs2&quot; };
//or
/*{ &quot;c:/program_files/messenger/508/508_RSPS/cache508/rs2&quot; };
IGNORE THE MSG ABOVE 


But if i put this:
{ &quot;c:/program files/messenger/508/508 RSPS/cache508/rs2&quot; };
and i send to my friends then they obviously download client to desktop probably .. 
then they must change the cache directory ... how could i do it so they doesn&#39;t have to change it.&quot;

Pls!</description>
