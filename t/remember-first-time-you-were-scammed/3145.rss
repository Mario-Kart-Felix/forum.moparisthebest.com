              <p>I was scammed for my first santa by 3v1l 4rch3r…yes I still remember his name- he musta been a really good convincer…Claimed he was duping so I’m like…ok -give him addy pick- He gives 2 back, give him a few oddball items that NO ONE really carried around.  Give him my santa which I had just bought for 200k…BAM he logs.  2 months later I come back to varrock where the rich people were always at and I was up to 1m or so(funny thing is that I gave 5 spinach rolls for a santa later that day ROFL no one had the warning on their pages that they werent worth anything back then :P) and I see him again…He had party hats, mask sets and santas out the ass- good scammer for avoiding fagex and getting the shit</p>
