    <description>hey so i was playing a server and before you log in you have to create an account BUT you do not create it on the website you create it on NEW USER in the client. it checks to see if the user is in use and then you make a password when you click next after that it finishes and says play now and it takes you to the login screen but its all in client with the login box and everything anyone know how to do this? is there a tutorial or anything?
