    <title>[Delta] Client null disconnection</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-client-null-disconnection/553254</link>
    <description>Okay, so I have been coding a new server the last couple of days(Acrylicx). I got to the point where I was ready to let a couple friends come and test so I could hammer the last of the bugs out.. Problem is no one could connect to my server, when they tried it said something along the line &quot;client null disconnected&quot; and their IP address. I was able to connect through localhost, but not my through my no-ip. Yes, I have successfully port forwarded. And yes, the port, and IP match up in GUI.java client-sided, and yes I have compiled. I suspect my error is either in client.java or server.java under the &quot;run()&quot; method. I suspect it may be a form of antileach even though the post said no antileach, but opinions and help would be much appreciated, I hope I can be running online soon.

Thanks,
