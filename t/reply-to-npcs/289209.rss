    <description>hello i forgot what the id for your players head is when you reply to an npc if you have it it would be helpful thanks, to be more descriptive in real rs when you talk to a npc it shows the npc&#39;s head to the left of text and if its a reply question or something it will show the players head to the right of text. the players head is what i need.</description>
