    <description>What are your thoughts on Human Genetic Engineering?

There are two types: [u]Somatic[/u] and [u]Germline[/u]

[u]Somatic[/u]
Treat or cure an existing condition; Will not affect genetic makeup

Example: Curing HIV in an individual, but can still pass HIV gene to offspring

[u]Germline[/u]
Targets genes in eggs, sperm, or early embryos; Passed down to offspring

Example: Choosing your offspring&#39;s eye color, hair color, height, etc.


Imagine a future where selecting your child&#39;s genes is the new normal, if you want them to be short or tall, have straight black hair or curly red hair, if you want them to have freckles, etc.

I&#39;m fine with curing a disease, but I think being able to choose your offspring&#39;s genes is slightly pushing the boundaries.</description>

Why should people die just so new ones can get born?<br>
And overpopulation isn’t a problem here. The biggest city in Norway have 623.000 people living in it, at least we have space so people don’t have to die. By avoiding to prevent anyone’s death, you are basicly killing them.</p>

On a local scale it may not be a problem… On a global scale it’s causing several problems<br>
More people = more production<br>
More production = more pollution<br>
More pollution = permanent damage on nature<br>
If there’s more people in like… 50 years from now then there won’t be any trees left to cut in Norway.<br>

<p>Though the possibility of space colonisation seems to become more possible as the years go by, i don’t think the mass production of materials and equipment would be available to everyone. In order to handle the population in a place where boundaries don’t exist, we would need an excess amount materials that we don’t necessarily have. Not to mention how you could handle the population with law enforcement, it seems almost impossible. Yes, we have new weapons we might use, but it just seems like with space exploration or colonisation, we will just become increasingly violent.</p>
<p>I’d assume the only way the aging gene would help is if there was a way to decide when it was reasonable for one being to leave when another enters. Causing a natural switch between death and birth would prove difficult, but there are factors in which people die willingly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, genetically changing the aging process would only cause further problems. Currently we complain about not living long enough, but that is because we don’t have that leisure to decide. If we are given the chance to do so, i believe that people may look at it differently. It would also cause problems with population and reproduction rates, think about it. If no one dies, but people are born, how will we sustain a healthy population rate? There are too many factors for this to be continued on, i’m not sure they will recognise the negative factors until it is too late.[/quote]</p>
<p>If it even becomes possible to slow down aging significantly, than no matter what legislation is placed on it, it can still be done by people with the know-how or the money.</p>

Sorry, I try to focus from now on, 'kay? What Amy said is pretty much what I tried to express, but had too vivid thoughts… Energy drinks, coffee, Coca cola are the things I am on. So far I don’t think these are illegal. Might be they should…?</p>

<p>I don’t think this guy has the ability to express what he thinks properly, or he may be on something illegal.</p>
<p>On the other hand, genetically changing the aging process would only cause further problems. Currently we complain about not living long enough, but that is because we don’t have that leisure to decide. If we are given the chance to do so, i believe that people may look at it differently. It would also cause problems with population and reproduction rates, think about it. If no one dies, but people are born, how will we sustain a healthy population rate? There are too many factors for this to be continued on, i’m not sure they will recognise the negative factors until it is too late.</p>

<p>What is the problem at that point? You are like let’s say the magical number of age, 420, and you meet this person you think is just perfect. (Perfection is actually something anything cannot achieve, because "Wow I can lift 300 Kg with my tongue! But hey…! What if I could lift 400 Kgs?! Then it goes on and on…) Anyway back at the topic, you have this person but when you suddenly get the thought of it… “How old are you actually?” You get answered “Something about 940 was the age I lost the count on… Well, you?” This is the moment, there is no indication of this person being this old, in fact this one looks really close your age! Is there any problem in loveing the brains off that being?! I can’t see any way of thinking this is not acceptable! However, at this point the definition of “ethically right” is very likely something completely other.</p>
<p>I also find the thought of biological immortality really a fun thing to think about. Let’s think it this way: You get your brain to disembark your body. “Yay! I can now use my super genetics to build me a new body from something! I’m a baby again! Baaah! Baah! Someone fetch me a nipple!” But hold on! The brain! It’s the same old P.O.S. you had in your last body! This is a human brain, it means it degrades with time and has long ago started losing it’s capabilities! “No probs, thou’! They have this new gene that rebuilds my brain!” Hmmm… A new brain… A fresh start with all the capabilities only rising! Hmm… “Hold on a second!! If my brain is completely new with new everything, isn’t that like I’m a new person with no memories from the past??” There is the problem I see! Well yes, if we don’t do the gene mods from like a “hydra” or “Turritopsis nutricula” but create a new kind of gene that preserves the current structure but just refreshes the vital parts, preserving the memories… Here’s yet another obstacle: How do we create one of these? We have no source on earth currently known to be of mid-high or better intelligence that has any feat even close to this! “Duhh! No problem! I count on these people!” Well I wouldn’t count they get this done in a long while! I think this might be the same era of time travel and compression of Uranus to a Kugelblitz! In other words not the time that I last in human form… Maybe I will be some creature that reminds us of a penisroach today? Maybe one of these Turritopsis nutriculas, but at this point, it doesn’t consern me in any way.</p>
<p>I could still go on with the thought of these “Let’s turn my child which isn’t born yet to Johanna Tukiainen!!” &lt;— I hope the person making this new monster will die a horrible death with lots of pain and tentacle-rape and maximal suffering!</p>
<p>-ArmorCroc</p>
<p>EDIT: MoparScape, really!? You force those roaches to sound even nastier… The implementation of “love” instead of “f*ck” is brilliant but… Aww come on! You’re doing like Jagex with their forced censoring back in those times! Stop it immediately! Or change the name “Uranus” to “Your Darkest hole” or something similar! I dare you!
