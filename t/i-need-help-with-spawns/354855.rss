    <title>I need help with spawns</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-spawns/354855</link>
    <description>I need help changing my new user log in spawn. I am editing the home place and put it in a different area. And I want new users to spawn there when they log in the first time. Where would I find the coding to change the x and y coordinates?

All help would be greatly appreciated!</description>

<p>Stand on the spot that you log in, and get the coordinates. Note them down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open up client.java and search for either the X or the Y coordinate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you find your match of BOTH of them in the brackets (####, ####, 0) or similar, then change these to the one coordinates you wish to use.</p>

<p>Laid it out a little easier… I presume you are using a 317?</p>

              <p>Do you know what I should search up? because there is a lot of coordinates. and I wouldn’t know which one is which.<br>
I know how to get coordinates and stuff. I already changed my ::home command. I just need to FIND the right patch of coding. But I have no clue, I never got to this part in programming before.</p>
