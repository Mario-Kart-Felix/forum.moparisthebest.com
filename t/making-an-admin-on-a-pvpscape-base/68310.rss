    <title>Making an admin on a Pvpscape base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-an-admin-on-a-pvpscape-base/68310</link>
    <description>       Ok, i know not very many people don&#39;t know this and I know it&#39;s a *DUH!*, but i would like to help out.
to start off you need to make the server and login. Next log out and go to your SOURCE folder,(should be in the private server folder on the C drive thingy) and open the CHARACTERS folder. Look for your username and open that file. open that up and look for were it says &quot;character-rights = 0&quot; now change the 0 to a 1,2 or 3.    --   AND REMEMBER! 1 = mod, 2 = staff, 3 = admin  --
ok now save and close that file. You might have to run your server again, but when you log back in you should be an Admin, staff, or mod!
THis was posted just because in the tutorial for some bases it says &quot;To make yourself a mod search for &quot;start of mod&quot; in the client.java file, and chang player rights to 1,2 or 3.&quot;
In the pvpscape base however, you [i]can[/i] find &quot;start of mod, but there is no, &quot;character-rights = 0&quot; or &quot;player-rights = 0&quot;.


Thanks, and please reply.</description>
