    <description>Hello guys,

I have a little issue with my fan. It keeps spinning like crazy and is making a lot of noise. On idle, it&#39;s fine. 
I&#39;ve only noticed it go berzerk when I do anything related to my GPU such as... playing a game or watching a video on YouTube. And I&#39;m talking trivial things such as oldschool rs. Never been an issue really. 

Task manager shows CPU and Memory to be fine and there are also no unusual applications, processes or services. 

Being certain that it&#39;s related to the GPU, question now is; How can I debug the issue I&#39;m having? How can I see what the computer is trying to do and why the GPU might cause the fan to spin more?</description>

              <p>I am very much certain it is not an issue with the actual card but a system issue. I don’t have this issue when on I’m using Ubuntu. Roll backing windows does not fix the issue. I will also not reinstall my OS.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

              <p>personally when my old gpu fan was above N% speed it would make a ticking sound, got it replaced<br>
you need to manually mess with the speed to see if thats causing the issue (you dont need to be in game and risk damage)</p>

              <p>is it the cpu fan thats noisy or the gpu fan? if its the CPU you could have an issues with the application of the thermal compound causing the CPU to heat up quickly however when playing games its pretty normal for the chip to heat up regardless if you are using a stock CPU heatsink and fan you could always upgrade to a better fan and heatsink</p>

I am definitely NOT going to change the settings manually. It’s spinning most logically because it’s heating up. It’s heating up most probably due to heavy work.</p>
<p>The question was to find the root cause and not a cheap fix. Which would definitely lead to more problems.</p>
<p>Sorry if I sound mean. Wasn’t expecting it.</p>
