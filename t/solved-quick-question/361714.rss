    <title>[solved]Quick question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solved-quick-question/361714</link>
    <description>Really weird to ask I know, but most of the people out there are having issues with the client. The server is running fine with just me on my own computer (connecting to 127.0.0.1), but when I enter my no-ip address into, it doesn&#39;t seem to work. :confused:
At first I thought that something was just wrong with the client, but I soon discovered otherwise. The client is able to connect to other servers I have on my computer (old czar age stuff), but isn&#39;t able to connect to this one using my no-ip address. Has anybody run into this issue at all, or do you know how to possibly fix? checked my server class, and it&#39;s running on port 43594, same as the client. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Here&#39;s a video I uploaded showing utorrent&#39;s port check working for other servers on my computer but not this one, to show that I port forwarded correctly.

Here&#39;s the code from client class.
[code]	public URL getCodeBase()
	{
		if(signlink.mainapp != null)
		return signlink.mainapp.getCodeBase();
		try
		{
			return new URL(&quot;http:75.128.206.13:&quot; + (80));
		}
		catch(Exception _ex)
		{
		}
		return null;
	}
	//public String server = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;[/code]
Been trying stuff for about 2 days so far, no luck.</description>

</aside>
<p>It’s a battlescape base actually, so the server’s ip is held in client class. And I think it’s a server issue, watch the youtube video I provided and you’ll see what I mean. It seems like something internally in the server (or somehow the server runs differently) is causing some kind of failure to open the port entirely. I’ve tried disabing my firewall and antivirus, no luck so I know it has nothing to do with that. there was another help thread on a different forum (that mopar doesn’t let me say what it’s called) where somebody else was having the exact same issue.</p>
<p>EDIT: I fixed it.</p>
