    <description>I want to make it so it shows the highest rank from each skill listed in a PHP file. I have done the HighScores tutorial of Deathschaos9.

I don&#39;t have the new HighScores Jagex one, I have the old one which is better.

I would like to know how to get the name and the level in there like this for example:

Overall: playerName(lvl)
Attack: playerName(lvl)

Thanks if you can help me. I would really like to learn with this.
