    <title>ASM has no constant pool?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/asm-has-no-constant-pool/293914</link>
    <description>Why doesn&#39;t ASM manipulate the constant pool? Is it something BCEL made up? Or, is there really a &quot;constant pool&quot; and ASM just doesn&#39;t have classes to manipulate it.</description>

              <p>ASM doesn’t use a constant pool. Rather than using indexes into the constant pool, ASM copies the data out of it.</p>
<p>It means that when you change the name of the class all you have to do is change a String, rather than find out which class definition the index is pointing to and then find the index of the name of that class definition and change that. Additionally all you are doing is changing a class name rather having the side affect of changing whatever else references that entry.</p>
<p>It adds a layer of abstraction which has a trade off in speed, but it is much easier and faster to program and debug.</p>

<p>As for ASM, I’m not entirely sure because I’ve never used it, but iirc you manipulate the ConstantPool through the same interface as the rest of the class rather than a seperate one.</p>
