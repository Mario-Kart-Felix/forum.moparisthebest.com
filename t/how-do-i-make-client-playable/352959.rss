    <title>How do I make client playable?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-client-playable/352959</link>
    <description>hello people, I am having a little problem with my client. I made a webclient using rs-ps.org and everything is messed up in there. So I think that the client will fix the problems.

Now when people login from the client, it just says error connecting to server, please reload client and try again. I change the GUI.java thing to my serverip and then this happens. When i change it to 127.0.0.1, it works.

Can anybody tell me how to fix this? thanks
