    <title>What Does &quot;Jar Signing&quot; Mean Exactly?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-does-jar-signing-mean-exactly/444473</link>
    <description>Hello,

I am terribly sorry if this is in the wrong section, But i just want to know what is Jar Signing? Does that mean that if i do &quot;Jar Sign&quot; my server will that allow other people to get onto my server without portforwarding or doing anything at all? Sorry about this i just wanted to know what it really means... I am running a 667-704 and i was about to Jar sign it but i was thinking maybe it might screw up my entire server i am really wanting for my friend to play on it, He just want&#39;s to play on it until i get completely done with it if anyone can help me out and if Jar signing really means that it will allow other people to play on it by just doing that and nothing else but that i would be glad to make you a mod i guess... Well that&#39;s it for now thanks guys!</description>
