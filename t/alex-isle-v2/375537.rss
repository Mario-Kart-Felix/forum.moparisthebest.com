    <description>Hi, I promised you I would release so here it is.
 
So I don&#39;t have any pictures but I might add it but it has everything on this: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,440269.0.html
 
Ok so i added dungeoneering like 6 months ago but it does not have the armours or weps or items.
You can add them if you want, to get to dungeoneering you go down the road and were you see the fountain,
the one to the right. Next to it is the cave to dungeoneering. Attack a npc to update the quest tab to see your level in dungeoneering.

I have added a brand new money making way, well for the server.
So in the emote tab you can click an emote and it will lead you to a chicken farm.
Then theres sent you a message how to do it and you will find out if you download.

Ok 1 bug fix you can fix witch i found out months ago but I had already decided to quit this project so I won&#39;t fix it but I will tell you the fix.
When you login and teleport, theres a major lag witch and there is a easy way to fix, and i recommend you fix. 
First go client.java
Search for Deleteobjects
And under there is were you delete object, know I want you to delete the code that is useless, example deleting object in 3200 3200 might be useless so delete around all except the ones you use.

Here is download: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17359665/Alex%20Isle%20V2.8%20Client%20and%20Source%20-%20Copy%20-%20Copy.rar

I don&#39;t want this anywere else released but ofcourse if you have done alot you can release as long as you give credits to me and other who released before me.</description>
