    <title>MySQL is this a bad way of approaching?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mysql-is-this-a-bad-way-of-approaching/426486</link>
    <description>I was working on a project and was wondering if you could quickly look over the database portion. The database server is expected to serve minimum 200 users and maximum of 650 users are peak time so I want to be as efficient as possible with my queries.

Would my query be appropriate for the following three tables or should I restructure the database to include user details with the users table (there are a lot more fields than what is shown here)?

(i haven&#39;t test this, its meant to be pseudo)
select articles.*, (select first_name from user_info where users.id=articles.author_id) as author, (select first_name from user_info where users.id=approvedby_id) as allowedby, from articles limit 25;

[table: Users]
id (primary key)
userName
userPassword


[table: user_info]      (data in this table has 1 to 1 relationship with users)
id (foreign key)
first_name
last_name
emailaddress


[table: articles]      (data in this table has/may have 1 to many relationship with users)
id (primary key)
title
message
author_id (foreign key) (this is a user id)
approvedby_id (foreign key) (this is a user id)</description>

              <p>Learn how to normalise. If you can have thirty fields in a table that all tell you something about the primary key alone (in other words, no functional dependencies and no transitive dependencies – 3NF) then there’s nothing wrong with a thirty field table. There’s nothing wrong with having a table that has a hundred fields if it’s in 3NF.</p>
<p>You have a 1:1 relationship between User_info and User, so you can mash those tables together and avoid the need for a join later on.</p>
<p>For the article table, you should move the message field out of the table.<br>
Consider this instead:</p>
<p>article<br>
id PRIMARY KEY<br>
title VARCHAR(255)<br>
message_id FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES message(id)<br>
author_id FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES user(id)</p>
<p>message<br>
id PRIMARY KEY<br>
message TEXT</p>
<p>The reason for this is that larger text fields are stored differently in the database. They aren’t stored with the rest of a relationship in the table.</p>

              <p>Personally, if I were to draw out an entity relationship diagram for this, I’d have Users as an entity. ‘first name’ and ‘last name’ would become a composite attribute and email address a simple attribute. Depending on if you’re using first normal form, you’d collapse first name and last name into simple attributes. The reason being is that both ‘user’ and ‘user_info’ have a total relationship.</p>
<p>Converting is as simple as creating a relation ‘Users’ with attributes ‘username’, ‘password’, ‘first name’, ‘last name’, and ‘email address’. This would get rid of the join which, in general, is pretty slow.</p>
<p>As for article, you say it “has/may have” which I’d need you to explicitly state it’s a weak entity type with 1:N relationship and whether it’s a total or partial relationship to help out further.</p>

<p>how many entities are in the user_info table?</p>

</aside>
<p>as many as there are in users table, 1 for each. I’ve split up these fields from the other table because they are only used in a small sub-section of the program (for organization purpose). I might be just using the join on these two table but thats why I’m not sure if splitting up the table and using join would be any beneficial compared to putting all the fields (columns) into one table.</p>
