[u][b]Rune-Battle Pkz Advertisement Thread[/b][/u]

[b]What Is Rune-Battle Pkz[/b]

This runescape private server has tons to offer you, we are a pking server with a decent pking economy. My Developer and I have been coding alot. No tutorials were used at all. We are a 24/7 server. Soon buying a vps, my coder is temporarly hosting the server on an intelcorei7 computer. So its 24/7 uptime guaranteed. Once we get some donations we will be purchasing a vps. 

[b]Server Features[/b]

- Pk Points Lottery System.
- Kill Streak System.
- Unique and new home, Falador. As alot of server&#39;s have Edgeville as home and gets boring.
- Tons of bosses and minigames.
- Shops that have pking items that you can start off with.
- Unique and great training areas.
- Spawning tab. You can&#39;t spawn amazing items and stuff. You spawn basically Tier 1 pking items, such as rune platebody/legs/helmet of neitznot etc..
- Domained Website/Forums.
- Donator rank with great features
- Skilling works, skilling locations teleport.
- Pking Areas, with pk locations teleport.
- 100% Working voting system, 50% credits to RuneTopList.
- Master/Zerker/Pure dialogues when you login, choose your stats!

[b]Our Goals[/b]

We want to become an active community, high playercount ingame and to be able to reach 1000+ votes on the toplists. We want to have great staff members who are always there to help and are dedicated. We also want to make sure that our players are happy to be with us. We always love to see and meet new players and welcome them.

[b]Why You Should Join Us[/b]

I honestly believe we are a unique pk server, we dont just offer Edgeville as home when you login, there are far too many servers with Edgeville as home. Our unique home attracts new players and people. We also have a pk points lottery system, which many server&#39;s dont have, we have a kill streak system. Which makes pking even more fun. You also have goals to set, get alot of pking points and then use them at the pk shop and get the strong armour! we just have alot features to benefit you guys. We also have a great Developer and an Owner who&#39;s named Anthony. Hes an Owner that actually care&#39;s about his player&#39;s, unlike other&#39;s who just ignore their private messages and ignore their people.
