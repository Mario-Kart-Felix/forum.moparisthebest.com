I’m really sorry for that…And I mean it, after I get the domain sorted out I will do my best to revive it.</p>
<p>Apparently the customer support isn’t the best on the new host either, because I was unsure how to configure the domain for the vps manually I had to contact the customer support, which was 8 days ago(15/01/2012). I’ve had 6 replies, each reply takes them day or two to write and the reply I get everytime is like 1-2 lines and the instructions given are unclear, but that’s what you get for cheap price I guess.</p>

<p>And guess who’s fault it is? That’s right! It’s kinda sad that you come here and post that shit when you fucked it all up in first place, and then you go all around and talk bullshit to people how bad owner I am and act innocent.</p>
<p>Isn’t it bit immature that you went online and tried to ruin the economy by spawning shitloads of hats and giving them out?..Good thing that not much are playing atm.</p>
<p>I bought a host from <a href="http://dewlance.com" rel="nofollow noopener">dewlance.com</a> and the domain too, it took 2 days to receive the domain, and after that I linked the domain with our VPS, but somehow the domain isn’t working, I opened a support ticket to ask them what’s wrong, but their support seems to be poor as hell. After I get everything working again, I will buy another month VPS from my own pocket and start advertising, updating etc. I think it will be a lot better now that Crooks is gone and replaced with professional advertiser/website programmer.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Bullshit obvious since people have told me that I should leave way long before we did not come along…</p>
<p>Bullshit since I haven’t logged in on RSCF… and Crooks is probably ‘carisa’ since she asked for my character to train… And if you still had my admin rank on that char… its your fault no one else.</p>
<p>And why would i give you the <a href="http://RSCF.com" rel="nofollow noopener">RSCF.com</a> domain if its on my namecheap account and we aint coming along? playing innocent for what? And why did I post about the domain? because if you state something like 24-48 hours and aint editing it… then its a false advertise.</p>
<p>Anyways /ignore thread,<br>
[/quote]<br>
It’s pathetic how you constantly act innocent to keep your reputation in this community, I feel bad for those who believe your lies.[/quote]<br>
You’re the one who is really sick here.<br>
What the fuck am I lieing about? Im telling you the situations… why would I take responsibily for something i haven’t done?</p>
<p>Also i don’t care about reputation, That’s what you did when you was 15 and trouser authority.<br>
Also you can’t stand a shit for what you’re doing and face the fact that you have taking too bad decisions.<br>
Well can’t be easy living in Finland 17 years old razorcutcut.</p>

<p>And guess who’s fault it is? That’s right! It’s kinda sad that you come here and post that shit when you fucked it all up in first place, and then you go all around and talk bullshit to people how bad owner I am and act innocent.</p>
<p>Isn’t it bit immature that you went online and tried to ruin the economy by spawning shitloads of hats and giving them out?..Good thing that not much are playing atm.</p>
<p>I bought a host from <a href="http://dewlance.com" rel="nofollow noopener">dewlance.com</a> and the domain too, it took 2 days to receive the domain, and after that I linked the domain with our VPS, but somehow the domain isn’t working, I opened a support ticket to ask them what’s wrong, but their support seems to be poor as hell. After I get everything working again, I will buy another month VPS from my own pocket and start advertising, updating etc. I think it will be a lot better now that Crooks is gone and replaced with professional advertiser/website programmer.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Bullshit obvious since people have told me that I should leave way long before we did not come along…</p>
<p>Bullshit since I haven’t logged in on RSCF… and Crooks is probably ‘carisa’ since she asked for my character to train… And if you still had my admin rank on that char… its your fault no one else.</p>
<p>And why would i give you the <a href="http://RSCF.com" rel="nofollow noopener">RSCF.com</a> domain if its on my namecheap account and we aint coming along? playing innocent for what? And why did I post about the domain? because if you state something like 24-48 hours and aint editing it… then its a false advertise.</p>
<p>Anyways /ignore thread,[/quote]<br>
It’s pathetic how you constantly act innocent to keep your reputation in this community, I feel bad for those who believe your lies.</p>

<p>You are supposed to run it via Run Client.bat, but if u are using different OS than windows, you need to run it via command prompt. Navigate to the RSCF folder and copy paste the line starting with “java -cp…” to the prompt.</p>

Its been up for few days, but since the domain is david’s I’m gonna have to buy another one, since we don’t get along anymore.<br>
So website is not avaible for now.</p>

[/quote]</p>
<p>that doesn’t work…and for someone who doesn’t have an account, wouldn’t that not work anyways? (need an account to play right?)</p>
<p>what happened to the original site and stuff? seems sketchy[/quote]<br>
If you already have an account for RSCFusion, you should be able to play just fine, but like I stated on that post, the website is going to be avaible in 48 hours. The domain I bought is still pending.</p>

It seems that there were some problems with MySQL, took about 3 hours to find out the reason, but it’s back online now. Go and enjoy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also P2P is going to be released soon.</p>
<p>EDIT: I bought ‘<a href="http://rscfusion.org" rel="nofollow noopener">rscfusion.org</a>’ domain, it will be active in 24-48 hours.[/quote]</p>
