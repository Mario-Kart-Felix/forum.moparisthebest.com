    <title>~report Button~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/report-button/379210</link>
    <description>i got bored and decided to make a new tool for RSPS its a report button that u place in client


all u do is open it up

click report and it well take you to your website 
atm when you click report it well take you to a website called hurtscape.tk


u can change that very fast.


Steps to change the website to your website address


open up
the folder:you well also need .net &amp; mircosoft basic to change the reporting website to your reporting website i made it so they cant see url or anything :P well onc you download .net and mircosoft basic visual you open up folder


You well see a button square shaped with blue and purple open it up (rember must need mircosoft basic to change url)

let it load wait around 2--5mins once its up
You well see a big blue box
then u well see how the program i made looks like right click on Report Button and go to View code:
you well see this:



Public Class Form1

    Private Sub Button2_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
        WebBrowser1.Navigate(&quot;http://hurtscape.tk&quot;)
    End Sub
End Class


Were it says &quot;http://HurtScape.tk&quot; Change that part into any website u want it to go to
so if u have a website and a chatbox for reporting or anything 
tpye it in it should looks like this


Public Class Form1

    Private Sub Button2_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
        WebBrowser1.Navigate(&quot;http://ReportAbusebuttontesint.com/&quot;)
    End Sub
End Class


well u can make the thing change into anything u want

i would recommend it for Report button
