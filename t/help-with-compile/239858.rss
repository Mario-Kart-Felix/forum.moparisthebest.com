    <description>Ok, i try to add a new case then go to the compiler. it comes up with this:

[code]

client.java:15292: orphaned case
               case 252:

client.java:17579: illegal start of expression
               public String passHash(String password) {

2 errors[/code]

So, i think that it must have been me adding the new case that caused the error. I delete the new case...

But then the same error! It was working before i added case, and now i dunno what to do. 
It doesnt make much sense, because i have not edited what it is talking about in the compiler.. Help please!</description>
