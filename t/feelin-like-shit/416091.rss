    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/feelin-like-shit/416091</link>
    <description>Hi mopar...

So for the past week or so, I&#39;ve pretty much, in an overall statement, felt like shit. I really haven&#39;t been giving a fuck to anything, and I&#39;ve been highly cynical about a lot of things. I&#39;ve never really felt like it, and I feel it&#39;s a little to much to say I&#39;m depressed. I just find that I come home from school, eat dinner, do my homework, then I&#39;ll maybe play guitar for an hour or two making up riffs that I forget by the next day. I&#39;ve pretty much stopped caring about games like runescape or minecraft, and while battlefield might be fun for an hour, I&#39;ll just get off. My only goal is to live for the weekend where I can have some margin of a good time, but lately I really haven&#39;t been hanging out with friends as much.

I&#39;ve been doing shit on stuff like tests, and I barely pay attention in class (for another reason too, but still). When I just have time to talk in class I guess stuff is ok, but when I come home I just fucking hate everything. Life just seems really slow and boring, and I just wanna live life to it&#39;s fullest before I drive myself into a pit of depression. Does anyone have any ideas of what I can do to get out of my shithole?</description>

Learn scripting languages and make websites , I can also work at like banking services because they seem to use ALOT of Java in their applets , I really like to program and that’s what I’m gonna do later on in my life.</p>
<p>I suggest you do something you like too , in a way it can actually produce somthing to you like money or knowledge.</p>

A lucid dream is when you realize that you’re dreaming and you can control what happens in it. Plus when you realize you’re dreaming, you become so aware so quickly.

But just like you the minute I get home this darkness just jumps on me and I feel awful and all I want to do is sleep to make it stop.

              <p>[quote=“Fridder, post:8, topic:416091”]I don’t give a shit about school either, and somehow my grades are all 85+.<br>
Last year, I didn’t do shit. I didn’t do homework, projects, … anything. I just sat my ass down and slept through most of the classes, and I passed with an 87. Must have been the quizzes/tests/classwork that I half-assed.</p>
<p>When your sick of feeling like shit, work out, take a shower, do your homework (optional) then sleep for a while. Or stay on mopar until 1am then attempt to do your homework but end up getting nothing done and continue looking on mopar.[/quote]</p>
<p>thats how i was through high school.</p>
<p>[quote=“CoonHunter, post:20, topic:416091”]To be honest, my day mood goes about the same.</p>
<p>I get up and go to work. When I’m done, I generally come home and sit in my room and just watch a movie, while pirating another. For example, I have 2 movies downloading as I type. The way I actually had this issue solved was me buying my street bike. The issue with this would be convincing your parents to let you get one. It took me 2 months to break my dad (asking daily, comming up with reasons every day, etc) while my mom said as long as I drive safe she doesn’t care. When people come to me with real problems like depression, or severe boredom leading to depression I actually suggest this.</p>
<p>Both of these are myn, while the street bike used to get far more attention, the clutch cable recently broke and a new one is getting harder to find. I bought my first motorcycle around 2 months after my aunt was killed. Riding a motorcycle is a great time to be able to clear your mind and only concentrate on the moment at hand. When going 60 on a cruiser or evern 130+ (i hit 146 so far) on a street bike (although not recommended for beginners) its just you and the moment. Nothing to hold you back, nothing to get in your way. Keep in mind that is a figure of speach. Things can hold you back, and stuff can get in your way. Anyways, if you decide on anything. I would suggest a Kawasaki ninja 250cc for a first bike. They are the most recommended bikes for beginners as they are small, and not speed demons.<br>

<p>i was thinking about getting a ninja 250 when i get my motorcycle license, a job save up for one.</p>
<p>OT: I was feeling like that for a long time and recently. my routine was similar. I think i was depressed b/c of my previous relationship. I’ve gotten way better having a girl at my college say hi to me daily has helped in the past couple months. that doesnt really apply to ur situation i dont think. but b4 that i was trying to find things to spark my interest and keep my mind off things that were making me feel that way. b4 my previous relationship i was feeling just like you(just b/c of the routine and line in general) and when my ex and i first got together everything seemed to be fixed but after we were over the feeling like shit was just amplified. Hope you find someway to stop feeling that way it sucks and ive been trying to start feeling better.</p>
