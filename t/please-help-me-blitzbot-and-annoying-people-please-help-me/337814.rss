    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-help-me-blitzbot-and-annoying-people-please-help-me/337814</link>
    <description> 1.) Blitz-Bot:Recently I&#39;ve been getting.. spammed, null-ed, and &quot;blitzed&quot;. I tried to hack the person back with the same program &quot;blitz-bot&quot; but it said it was rejected. They did not have my I.P blocked, I did not use the name &quot;SYIpkpker&quot; the other person hacked me with &quot;SYIpkpker&quot; and I have that named blocked in the list on names to not-allow to connect.


 2.) Dial-Up: I have a hacker on my server who uses dial-up &quot;PPP&quot;. So every time he restarts his computer he can easily get a new I.P, he has been trying constantly for TWO MONTHS! chasing away player&#39;s EVEN BANNING PLAYERS and he has no admin powers/etc. He log&#39;s in with diffrent account names, I just want to get rid of him. 

Please guys, I beg of thee and the mopar lords to bring mercy to my server lmfao :(</description>
