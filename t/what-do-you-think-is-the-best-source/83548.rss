    <title>What do you think is the best source?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-think-is-the-best-source/83548</link>
    <description>What do you think is the best source, I&#39;m deciding one I should use because I frankly just don&#39;t like testscape.  I&#39;m having codeing problems and somebody said &quot;it doesn&#39;t work on testscape&quot;  that was pretty much the last straw.  The version of testscape I had didn&#39;t even have the slayer skill it said the dude had removed it.  And you actually needed runes for spells to do damage (how cheap)  So pretty much what do you think is the best source (you can say testscape) If you know where to find one include a link on where to download the latest version of it.</description>
