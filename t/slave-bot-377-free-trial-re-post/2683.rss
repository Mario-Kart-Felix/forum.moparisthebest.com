<p>Just look at the mousepackets before and after, thier is a huge difference.  Your old aryan often does a whole moving procedure using old scar mouse functions in 150millisecs, which would appear as one huge mouse jump to jagex.  Not to mention if you did slow it down, the function is dectable.  hence srl moved on to using benland.  I modified the mousemanger, mousefunctions, accessormethods, minimap-off, added in gui abilities.  Used half of benland’s spine implementation.  His implementation had a issue out of box, threw on my own front to it, and fixed bug.  Keep in mind all these mouse procedure additions are only helpful when one is flagged serverside (player reported you).</p>
<p>eXemplar i agree with what you said about pplsuqbawlz.</p>
<p>As for why mr X hasn’t ddos’ed easybake, it would be a conflict of intrests for mr X.</p>

<li>My WMV codec appears to be working fine for me. I may be wrong, and I may not be.</li>
<li>You should be, considering someone with and IQ &gt; 120, and actually knows what hes doing with Java coded it.</li>
<li>How would someone be that retarded to buy something they can get for free, and are getting away with it? Wheres the given evidence that goes along with this statement? Oh, forgot, you never have evidence to give.</li>
<li>Either way, pointless topic on your part. The more posts in your thread there are, the more a leecher who doesn’t care to read is gonna think its better. If anything, thats where you get publicity from the posts. If everyone actually cared to read the posts, then I’d have to say ‘your’ bot would be one of the least popular out there.</li>

<p>Although, I do have to thank you GenoDemoN for giving me a good comical relief, after all, thats pretty much the only thing any of impsofts code is good for.</p>

Well, all of these arguements are pretty convincing, but, when i mine with the normal aryan my mminers get banned around lvl65 mining, I’mnow mining with slavebot and my miner is already at 72 mining and still not yet banned, that should be proof that there must be some difference…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Right now, I’ve been using the same 20 accounts I’ve had for 2.5 - 3 weeks and none of them are banned.  I’m just using Aryan.  Maybe they’re just not banning people as much right now with the whole “huge client update” they have panned.  Reason being maybe they are collecting data from known autoers to put it to use?  I have no idea.  Normally, my accounts last around a week - week and a half and this time They’ve gone around twice that.  I don’t know why, I just think it’s really weird.  About 15 of the miners are 75+ mining as they are mining addy.  I have mined only iron ore from level 15 to 75.  I have no explanation for it, I find it rather odd.[/quote]</p>
<p>they might know your accts are auoters and are just watching to see whwere the gps go.</p>

Well, all of these arguements are pretty convincing, but, when i mine with the normal aryan my mminers get banned around lvl65 mining, I’mnow mining with slavebot and my miner is already at 72 mining and still not yet banned, that should be proof that there must be some difference…<br>

<p>Right now, I’ve been using the same 20 accounts I’ve had for 2.5 - 3 weeks and none of them are banned.  I’m just using Aryan.  Maybe they’re just not banning people as much right now with the whole “huge client update” they have panned.  Reason being maybe they are collecting data from known autoers to put it to use?  I have no idea.  Normally, my accounts last around a week - week and a half and this time They’ve gone around twice that.  I don’t know why, I just think it’s really weird.  About 15 of the miners are 75+ mining as they are mining addy.  I have mined only iron ore from level 15 to 75.  I have no explanation for it, I find it rather odd.[/quote]</p>
<p>That seems reasonable enough…</p>

Lol, GenoDemoN… Pd has just confirmed everything I have said about slave bot, and yet you still deny it. What makes you think, that your word is worth more then the respect of most community members of just about every cheating site? Is it because “you” coded it? After Pd has made the facts so evident, you’re still ignorant to come to the facts that you indeed have been shown up. But heres the sad thing, GenoDemoN… Today anyone who can make command prompt echo a variable is being considerd a programmer, you aren’t even one of those people. I’m sure if I had a keylogger on your computer that the 3 most used keys would be ‘Ctrl’, ‘C’, and ‘V’. The day you earn your SCJP will be the day I’m instituted in an insanity ward. And from our discussion… Oo, so what? Your SCAR autofighter was great. Now your on Java, and the thing is, you’re not even the one coding any of it. So, if I were you, I’d either start coding some shit that actually worked. Or at least take credit for something decent.</p>
