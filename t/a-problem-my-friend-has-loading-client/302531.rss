    <title>A Problem my Friend has... Loading Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-problem-my-friend-has-loading-client/302531</link>
    <description>Whenever he tries to load my client, he gets &quot; &#39;java&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command.&quot;

Thing is, I&#39;m not hosting it, but my other friend is. I can get on fine, not sure about anyone else, but he can&#39;t.
Here&#39;s the client&#39;s coding (He has JDK6 update 16, and his path is set as [code]CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_16\bin;%CLASSPATH%;[/code]
It works fine for me when I try with the uploaded client files, perfectly infact, but he just has bad luck, I guess.)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 16, 2009, 02:55:03 pm[/size][hr]This also works with one of my other friends. So, any help :s?</description>
