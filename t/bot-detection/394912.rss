    <description>Even if we do everything server side, what stop bot makers from using the algorithms we develop to figure out how to skate around them?

Essentially, everything needs to be logged, and the only way to even have an idea someone was botting would be reports from players.  Which would require a group of people to go through the logs.

Also, who gets to see the logs?  Select people, or everyone?  I think allowing everyone to do their own investigation into botters would be interesting, and helpful.

Anyway, we need some ideas, and a plan.</description>

              <p>Now, in my eyes, the option where players could report people would be pretty good.<br>
But, not the way it was in rsc, but in the way it just got made in rs2 where you can right click and “report” a player that way.<br>
Now, seeing as this would bring up people spamming the report, but that can be avoided by just giving out reporting to certain people that have played for some time and haven’t broken any rules.</p>

              <p>I decided to bump this topic because I was going to make a similar topic <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Just had an idea pop into my head about 2 minutes ago. The bot detection would be client sided and deal with player clicking. Say player A clicks on an item on the ground and the item is behind the tree from the players point of view. So a bot would either rotate the camera and find the item… or it would know the item is there and right click on the tree and pick up the item. The client would notify the server every time an item was indirectly clicked, as explained through a game image/model. Has anybody ever thought of this or anything similar?</p>
<p>After thinking about it…I think this would fit the runescape 2 client more than anything… and after reading what I just wrote it sounds like shit. Just brainstorming…</p>
<p>On a more serious note : The latest rsc client records logs like this… click x, click y, current x, current y. So if a bot clicks and the mouse is more or not exactly at the point of click As for when and the duration of mouse recordings… no idea.</p>

              <p>RS2 sends mouse movements and clicks to the server to be analyzed if the the user is flagged, we can put that same functionality into the client/server and analyze the mouse movements/clicks on the server side at some later time to see if they look approximately correct.  That should stop just about all RSC style bots.</p>

<p>That’s the thing though, bot makers can easily look at the criteria we’re searching for, and avoid meeting that…</p>
<p>Also, you can’t check times like that, there are a number of things that make time between actions inconsistent.  For measuring things based on time between actions, you’d need to measure latency, and do some statistics on it…</p>
<p>I think logging things like mouse position, camera angle, etc. would be more useful, because bot makers need to switch their entire approach, and simulate mouse movements, key presses, etc.  It would be much easier for us to implement, and find patterns in things like that than something that is naturally inconsistent.</p>
