So, he told you he bought a Domain firstly by accident than I told him it wasn’t a vps and wrote a Support ticket for him to get his money back, then directed him to a certain vps to buy (which he bought on the spot). Then I was setting it up for him (Because he let me have access) oh &amp; that I added a lot of code\simple things to his server over the course of a day that he wanted me to add, because I felt like helping out. So, you don’t know what were talking about. Quit acting like you do, I’m not talking about is compiler\run.bat which is a easy</p>
