    <title>Adding new crowns. rights 2 and 3 are same crown?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-new-crowns-rights-2-and-3-are-same-crown/428376</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m trying to overhaul my crowns on my server. I&#39;m tired of the classic ones and I&#39;m adding a lot more.
I know player rights go something like this:
0 = Player
1 = Mod
2 = Admin
3 = Owner
4 = Donor/hiddin/blank
5 = Blank
6 = Blank
7 = Blank

I set it to this:
0 = Player
1 = Mod
2 = Admin
3 = Owner
4 = Coder
5 = Donor
6 = V.I.P
7 = Extreme Donor

And I modified every part of my client to have it like that. MODICON 0 is supposed to be Mod and it goes up by one from there. Ending at 6. That shouldn&#39;t be a problem though since that&#39;s how it is normally set.

But when I log in MODICON 1 is set to mod and Owner crown shows for both Owner and Admin. Can someone help?
EDIT: and to top it all off only 4 icons show..</description>
