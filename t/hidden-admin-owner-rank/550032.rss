    <description>I have been looking around google and such for a tutorial to do this for a 317 revision project insanity base source, but i couldnt find a tutorial, so if someone could be nice enough and give me a tutorial of how to add this rank for a 317 revision [PI] base that would be excellent :)</description>

              <p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:2, topic:550032”]Technically, the rank already exists.</p>
<p>There is no pre-defined “Ranks” in the server. Whatsoever. The modicons and all that, are done in the client.</p>
<p>So basically, if you want to make a new rank. Just give the player whatever rights you want them to have (as long as it’s a valid Integer). So like 4, 5, 1000, 21846, -1384, whatever.</p>
<p>Then you can assign commands and etc to it, by editing their respected files.</p>
<p>Example, you have the ::players command only for moderators (rights 1) and you want the “hidden admin” (rights 1111) to have access to it:</p>
<p><code>if(playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase("players") &amp;&amp; c.playerRights == 1) {
     c.sendMessage("there are " + PlayerHandler.players.length + " players online");
}</code><br>
Now you’d change that to:</p>
<p><code>if(playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase("players") &amp;&amp; (c.playerRights == 1 || c.playerRights == 1111)) {
     c.sendMessage("there are " + PlayerHandler.players.length + " players online");
}</code></p>
<p>Understand that this is not the “best” way to handle your commands, and you should look into a better system if this is similar to what you’re using.<br>
And also note that this was purely an example.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks a bunch this definitely helps. rep++</p>
