    <title>How difficult would this be?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-difficult-would-this-be/442340</link>
    <description>I&#39;m pretty new to coding and mostly been reading through tuts and using them to add to Project Insanity and make it better, which is nice but that really doesn&#39;t require much skill at all lol. My question is I would like to change the teleports in the book to portals. For instance I&#39;ll have a portal set up and when you click it, it brings up a menu with a few options and you click one and it teleports you. Is this something for more experienced people or could I pull it off?

Thanks</description>

<p>Not hard at all.</p>
<p>What you would do is code in a portal first off.</p>
<p>Then login as your admin and click the now coded portal. Assuming you set up clicking buttons right. It should show what clicking buttons ID the new portal is.</p>
<p>Then goto clickingbuttons.java, and find the switch statement, or the section with all the case XXXX: things. Add the ID you got above into it as a new case. for example say my portal was ClicingButtons ID 3493.<br>
it would look like this, kind of.<br>
case 3493:<br>
//Code here<br>
break;</p>
<p>That should get you started.</p>
