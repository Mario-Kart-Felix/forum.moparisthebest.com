&lt;blockquote&gt;Newtown, Connecticut (CNN) -- Dressed in black fatigues and a military vest, a heavily armed man walked into a Connecticut elementary school Friday and opened fire, shattering the quiet of this southern New England town and leaving the nation reeling at the number of young lives lost.
Within minutes, 26 people were dead at Sandy Hook Elementary School -- 20 of them children. Among the six adults killed were Dawn Hochsprung, the school&#39;s beloved principal, and school psychologist Mary Sherlach.
The shooter, identified by three law enforcement officials as 20-year-old Adam Lanza, also was killed, apparently by his own hand.
&quot;Stuff like this does not happen in Newtown,&quot; a tight-knit community of about 27,000 just outside Danbury, said Renee Burn, a local teacher at another school in town. In the past 10 years, only one homicide had previously been reported.

 How the school shooting unfolded Student: I saw bullets going past 3rd grader describes shooting from class
&quot;Evil visited this community today,&quot; Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy said.
How do we stop the violence?
Young students described being ushered into bathrooms and closets by teachers as the first shots rang out.
Third-grader Alexis Wasik said police and teachers barged into her classroom and told students to hide in the corner.
&quot;Everybody was crying,&quot; she said. &quot;And I just heard the police officers yelling.&quot;
One parent who was in the school at the time of the shooting said she heard a &quot;pop, pop, pop,&quot; sound around 9:30 a.m. In the room with her were Hochsprung, the vice principal and Sherlach. All three left the room and went into the hall to see what was happening. The parent ducked under the table and called 911.
&quot;I cowered,&quot; she told CNN&#39;s Meredith Artley. The shooter &quot;must have shot a hundred rounds.&quot;
Responding police officers helped evacuate the children, telling them to hold hands and keep their eyes closed to the carnage as they exited the building.
&#39;I hope my mom is ok&#39;: Tweets from the Connecticut school shooting
As reports of the shooting surfaced, frantic parents descended on a nearby firehouse where the children had been taken.
&quot;Why? Why?&quot; one woman wailed as she walked up a wooded roadway leading from the school.
&#39;It doesn&#39;t seem possible&#39; -- parents shocked by school shooting
Police declined to speculate on a motive Friday evening, citing the ongoing investigation. Lanza had no known criminal record, a law enforcement official said.
Three weapons were recovered from the school: a semi-automatic .223 Bushmaster found in a car in the school parking lot, and a Glock and a Sig Sauer found with Lanza&#39;s body, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said. The weapons were legally purchased by Lanza&#39;s mother, the official said.
The official said Lanza died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Lt. J. Paul Vance of the Connecticut State Police said that the medical examiner will determine the cause of death for the gunman, though he noted that police never discharged their weapons.
In addition to the killings at Sandy Hook, another adult was found dead at a second location in Newtown, Vance said. A law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation identified that person as Lanza&#39;s mother, Nancy, who was found dead at a Newtown residence. She was a teacher at Sandy Hook, sources said.
Meanwhile, authorities in Hoboken, New Jersey, were questioning Ryan Lanza, the suspect&#39;s older brother, law enforcement sources said, though they did not label him a suspect. Lanza&#39;s father, who lives in Connecticut, was similarly questioned, one of the law enforcement officials said.
The fact that so many of those killed were young children -- Sandy Hook serves students in kindergarten through fourth grade -- touched a nerve across the world Friday, from U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders expressing grief to regular folks reacting with horror on social media as the news unfolded. The overwhelming sentiment: Hug your kids closely.
Obama, a father of two girls, wiped away tears while delivering a statement about the shooting, saying, &quot;Our hearts are broken today.&quot;
&quot;The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old,&quot; he said.
Flags were ordered to fly at half-staff nationwide in tribute to the victims, and candlelight vigils were being planned across the country as Americans came together to try to comprehend the tragedy.
&quot;This is most definitely the worst thing we&#39;ve experienced in town,&quot; Newtown Police Lt. George Sinko said.
It is not yet known how the gunman entered the school.
Slain principal worked to keep students safe
Hochsprung, the slain principal, had recently installed a new security system to ensure student safety.
Under the new system, every visitor would be required to ring a doorbell at the front entrance after the doors locked at 9:30 a.m. and report to the main office to sign in.
Police began receiving reports of shots fired around 9:40 a.m. Friday.
With the death toll at 26, the Newtown shooting is the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, behind only the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech that left 32 people dead.
In 1999, at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, two students shot 13 people to death before killing themselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Its sad really, I mean high school shootings and such arent as sad to me, but when it comes to kids Its just horrible.</description>

</aside>
<p>His sacrifice is so great? you mean when he sacrificed himself to himself to save you from himself?</p>
<p>You’re incredibly unintelligent, not for your religious beliefs (though that does enforce my opinion of you) but because you’re so poorly spoken and narrow-minded that it’s impossible to try to communicate with you before you start throwing out your ‘almost-sentences’.</p>
<p>you’ve also pretty much ignored Zyle’s post. he stated that your god either ignores evil or allows it, both of which are pretty shitty, and you pretty much responded with “oh he does just not all of it” (correct me if I’m wrong). why does he not stop all of it? you can’t say “because his allowance of free will” because the “free will” you’re describing is not free will, it’s “do what I say or I will kill you”. If someone with a gun were to come up to you, point it to your head, and say “do what I say or I will shoot you”, is that really free will? I mean sure, you can choose to not do what he says, but in the end it’s a pretty raw deal.</p>

He didn’t want this (or all the bad things that happens in the world) to happen in the first place but he respect your free will and the decisions you make as your own (otherwise there wouldn’t be judgement). If some one want God’s help should ask for it and live accordingly to his will. That’s why i commented about government decisions, you can’t expect God’s protection  when the nation turn their back against him, but yet God is a God love, mercy and justice.</p>

<p>He didn’t want this (or all the bad things that happens in the world) to happen in the first place but he respect your free will and the decisions you make as your own (otherwise there wouldn’t be judgement). If some one want God’s help should ask for it and live accordingly to his will. That’s why i commented about government decisions, you can’t expect God’s protection  when the nation turn their back against him, but yet God is a God love, mercy and justice.</p>

<p>Everything has a purpose, the sperm wont become a baby by itself. You can’t and will never justify killing with that kind of argument.</p>

So then you would still kill the baby because of a chance, I guess you would never drive a car because you have the chance of dying in an accident. Also doctors say a lot of things that aren't right, there are second opinions and if the situation is real bad a cesarean procedure.
<p>It’s cause and effect, if you take action assume the consequences of them.</p>

              <p>in that case a single sperm is also a state of growing of a living individual, so would masturbation be considered a mass genocide of those “living individuals”?</p>
<p>and what if the fetus has a chance of killing the mother during childbirth, or in any of the development stages? should it just be “oh well, abortion is murder”?</p>

              <p>[quote=“Cole1497, post:134, topic:473354”]three-fourths of embryos never become babies, they’re made of cells that either become a tumor, baby, or nothing at all.</p>
<p>if miscarriages are okay because they weren’t intentional, manslaughter should be okay too[/quote]<br>
Well that’s your opinion about it I see, but i already expressed my opinion too and i don’t really think there is a need to repeat myself again, or you if didn’t understand it well i will try to explain it more clear to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>embryos are a state of growing of a living individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>miscarriages can happen naturally without her or other person intervention (else there is a problem).</p>
</li>
</ul>
