    <title>More Detailed Tutorial On How To Set Up A 601/602 Server + Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/more-detailed-tutorial-on-how-to-set-up-a-601-602-server-client/351831</link>
    <description>Ok I was looking through the comments on the &quot;First ever 601/602 server and client release&quot; or something like that, and it seems to me that many people were having diffuculty, especially with setting up the  602cache and XAMPP. So i&#39;ve decided to realease a more detailed explanation of how to set up 601/602 servers and clients. Please note I did not personally release the original post, I am merely trying to assist those who were having difficulty.


Step 1: Getting an extracting tool (if you don&#39;t have):

The first thing you will need to do is make sure you have winrar or 7-zip to extract files. In case you don&#39;t for some reason, here are the links:

7-zip: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/files/7-Zip/9.15/7z915.exe/download

Winrar: http://www.win-rar.com/index.php?id=970&amp;dl=wrar393.exe

Pick a file above, personally winrar will be more useful but I believe 7zip is easier to install for begginers. But this isn&#39;t necessarily a begginers tutotial so its up to you. After you download it, install it.

Step 2: Setting up the cache for a 602 server:

Now that you have an extracting tool, you will need to download the 602cache file to your desktop preferably. Here is the link for that: 

602Cache: http://www.mediafire.com/?ktzyymnkmdw

After you&#39;ve downloaded that to your desktop you will need to right-click and hit &quot;Extract to 602cache/&quot; if u have winrar, or &quot;Extract here&quot; if you are using 7-zip.

You will then have a folder file called &quot;602cache&quot; on your desktop. You must then open your start menu and on the right side, right around the middle it should say &quot;Computer&quot;, click that. There might be a lot of things like disk drives and removable disks, but ignore that, and find the main hard drive thing. Some computers will call it &quot;Local Disk (C:)&quot; and some will call it other things like hard drive or some kind of drive but will always end in (C:) and will always be towards the top, usually the first thing. For the sake of further tutorials I advise anyone&#39;s whose doesn&#39;t say &quot;Local Disk&quot; to change it to &quot;Local Disk&quot; (The (C:) will add itself). 

Now that you got that open, it should have alot of folders and whatnot. To make sure your on the right page, look for the folder called &quot;Program Files&quot; (DON&#39;T OPEN IT). Please note that some computers may say &quot;Program Files (x86)&quot;, some may say both. That is ok, we are just verifying that ur on the local disk. Now, don&#39;t open any of those folders, but drag your 602cache from your desktop into your Local Disk (C).

That&#39;s all! You&#39;ve set up your 602cache sucessfully.


Step 3: Obtaining the 601/602 server and client:

Download the client from this link: http://www.mediafire.com/?wjnmtwtw1zz

Download the server from this link: http://www.mediafire.com/?cntwml54xwz

Again, I recomend putting these on your desktop. Then extract them to your desktop, and to make things more managable, I advise you to put the 2 folders in a new folder calle &quot;601/602 Server  + Client&quot; or something like that. 

That&#39;s all for now!


Step 4: Setting up XAMPP and adding databases:

To add the database for players, packets, and time you will need to setup XAMPP. First of all, Download the XAMPP installer:

XAMPP installer link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/xampp-win32-1.7.3.exe/download

Install it, and then open the control panel. Unfortunately, I can not make a detailed description of installation as my computer is having a lot of errors with uploading pics right now, but hopefully i&#39;ll have that fixed and have a detailed tutorial for installation of XAMPP up by later today or tomorow morning. Until then, you can look up tutorials about installing XAMPP if your totally lost, or if it&#39;s just a simple question, post it and ill try my best to respond ASAP.

After you run it, all I can say is make sure its running MySQL and Apache in the control panel.

After you installed XAMPP, you need the databases, which are at the following link:

XAMPP Databases: http://www.mediafire.com/?diwylojzhjt

I know the file is called XAMPP.rar, but don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s just the databases. After you&#39;ve downloaded that (again I advice the desktop), extract it to the desktop. Now open that Local Disk (C:) like we were talking about earlier, and notice the folder now there called &quot;xampp&quot;. Open it, and then open the folder inside it called &quot;htdocs&quot;, and once your inside there minimize the local disk for a second. Now open the XAMPP databases on your desktop and continue opening folders until you reach &quot;test&quot;. Don&#39;t open it. Drag it into the &quot;htdocs&quot; inside the local disk.

Now go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/

The username is &quot;root&quot; and by default there is no password unless you set one up.

Now you have to go to the databases section and find the database called test. If you go under it in the section called &quot;players&quot;, there should be an example player named Hotyute. This is where all the player data will be saved. Same for items and packets. Now you can leave that alone for now.

CONGRATULATIONS ! That&#39;s it ! 

Now just open the server and run it. When prompted to debug, type &quot;yes&quot; and hit enter (for programming purposes). 

Now open the client, run through all those files (or use ctrl+f) and find &quot;run.&quot; 

The Game will load up, and please note that you can NOT log in with any name or pass. You must first register with the &quot;Create Account&quot; protocol located right above login. Member or non member doesn&#39;t matter, I think. 

Now log in! You can give rights and edit players and items through the XAMPP databases, and make sure the XAMPP control pannel is running.


Please note this tutorial is meant to break down the process for begginers, it may be a little over-simplified in some points but I did this to help the new coders. I hope this tutorial helps some people. Please post any comments, suggestions, compliments, or problems, and i&#39;ll try to respond quickly. Hope it helps.

*Note: I did not create this server and 100% of the credits for the actual databases, caches, client, and server go to hotyute, who originally released them on rune server&#39;s webiste.*

Thanks!

          <blockquote>
              <p>Ok I was looking through the comments on the “First ever 601/602 server and client release” or something like that, and it seems to me that many people were having diffuculty, especially with setting up the  602cache and XAMPP. So i’ve decided to realease a more detailed explanation of how to set up 601/602 servers and clients. Please note I did not personally release the original post, I am merely trying to assist those who were having difficulty.</p>
<p>Step 1: Getting an extracting tool (if you don’t have):</p>
<p>The first thing you will need to do is make sure you have winrar or 7-zip to extract files. In case you don’t for some reason, here are the links:</p>
<p>7-zip: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/files/7-Zip/9.15/7z915.exe/download" rel="nofollow noopener">http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/files/7-Zip/9.15/7z915.exe/download</a></p>
<p>Winrar: <a href="http://www.win-rar.com/index.php?id=970&amp;dl=wrar393.exe" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.win-rar.com/index.php?id=970&amp;dl=wrar393.exe</a></p>
<p>Pick a file above, personally winrar will be more useful but I believe 7zip is easier to install for begginers. But this isn’t necessarily a begginers tutotial so its up to you. After you download it, install it.</p>
<p>Step 2: Setting up the cache for a 602 server:</p>
<p>Now that you have an extracting tool, you will need to download the 602cache file to your desktop preferably. Here is the link for that:</p>
<p>602Cache: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ktzyymnkmdw" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mediafire.com/?ktzyymnkmdw</a></p>
<p>After you’ve downloaded that to your desktop you will need to right-click and hit “Extract to 602cache/” if u have winrar, or “Extract here” if you are using 7-zip.</p>
<p>You will then have a folder file called “602cache” on your desktop. You must then open your start menu and on the right side, right around the middle it should say “Computer”, click that. There might be a lot of things like disk drives and removable disks, but ignore that, and find the main hard drive thing. Some computers will call it “Local Disk (C:)” and some will call it other things like hard drive or some kind of drive but will always end in (C:) and will always be towards the top, usually the first thing. For the sake of further tutorials I advise anyone’s whose doesn’t say “Local Disk” to change it to “Local Disk” (The (C:) will add itself).</p>
<p>Now that you got that open, it should have alot of folders and whatnot. To make sure your on the right page, look for the folder called “Program Files” (DON’T OPEN IT). Please note that some computers may say “Program Files (x86)”, some may say both. That is ok, we are just verifying that ur on the local disk. Now, don’t open any of those folders, but drag your 602cache from your desktop into your Local Disk ©.</p>
<p>That’s all! You’ve set up your 602cache sucessfully.</p>
<p>Step 3: Obtaining the 601/602 server and client:</p>
<p>Download the client from this link: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?wjnmtwtw1zz" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mediafire.com/?wjnmtwtw1zz</a></p>
<p>Download the server from this link: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?cntwml54xwz" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mediafire.com/?cntwml54xwz</a></p>
<p>Again, I recomend putting these on your desktop. Then extract them to your desktop, and to make things more managable, I advise you to put the 2 folders in a new folder calle “601/602 Server  + Client” or something like that.</p>
<p>That’s all for now!</p>
<p>Step 4: Setting up XAMPP and adding databases:</p>
<p>To add the database for players, packets, and time you will need to setup XAMPP. First of all, Download the XAMPP installer:</p>
<p>XAMPP installer link: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/xampp-win32-1.7.3.exe/download" rel="nofollow noopener">http://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/xampp-win32-1.7.3.exe/download</a></p>
<p>Install it, and then open the control panel. Unfortunately, I can not make a detailed description of installation as my computer is having a lot of errors with uploading pics right now, but hopefully i’ll have that fixed and have a detailed tutorial for installation of XAMPP up by later today or tomorow morning. Until then, you can look up tutorials about installing XAMPP if your totally lost, or if it’s just a simple question, post it and ill try my best to respond ASAP.</p>
<p>After you run it, all I can say is make sure its running MySQL and Apache in the control panel.</p>
<p>After you installed XAMPP, you need the databases, which are at the following link:</p>
<p>XAMPP Databases: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?diwylojzhjt" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mediafire.com/?diwylojzhjt</a></p>
<p>I know the file is called XAMPP.rar, but don’t worry, it’s just the databases. After you’ve downloaded that (again I advice the desktop), extract it to the desktop. Now open that Local Disk (C:) like we were talking about earlier, and notice the folder now there called “xampp”. Open it, and then open the folder inside it called “htdocs”, and once your inside there minimize the local disk for a second. Now open the XAMPP databases on your desktop and continue opening folders until you reach “test”. Don’t open it. Drag it into the “htdocs” inside the local disk.</p>
<p>Now go to <a href="http://localhost/phpmyadmin/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://localhost/phpmyadmin/</a></p>
<p>The username is “root” and by default there is no password unless you set one up.</p>
<p>Now you have to go to the databases section and find the database called test. If you go under it in the section called “players”, there should be an example player named Hotyute. This is where all the player data will be saved. Same for items and packets. Now you can leave that alone for now.</p>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS ! That’s it !</p>
<p>Now just open the server and run it. When prompted to debug, type “yes” and hit enter (for programming purposes).</p>
<p>Now open the client, run through all those files (or use ctrl+f) and find “run.”</p>
<p>The Game will load up, and please note that you can NOT log in with any name or pass. You must first register with the “Create Account” protocol located right above login. Member or non member doesn’t matter, I think.</p>
<p>Now log in! You can give rights and edit players and items through the XAMPP databases, and make sure the XAMPP control pannel is running.</p>
<p>Please note this tutorial is meant to break down the process for begginers, it may be a little over-simplified in some points but I did this to help the new coders.
