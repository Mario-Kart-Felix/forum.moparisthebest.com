    <title>My Client &amp; Source. ******HELP*****</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-client-source-help/385868</link>
    <description>Im having problems with my client.
1. I start up my source. ( It says: Online. )
2. I go to my client&#39;s website address. Click sign in put my username and pass then the client loads. After loading my person pops up invisable with a random gamertag, then the client freezes.
3. After freezing all that stuff pops up 1. reset your browser. blahh blahh.

I just want to know how to stop my server from freezing. If you want to know the spacific server I downloaded from here i&#39;ll give it to you.

I have done absolulty every step that im supposed to. The server is a 317. I opend a gaming port in my moddum. I downloaded no-ip. I went in my computer and got my ip. Is there absolutly anything that i could have done wrong to make my server freeze when trying to loggin?? 

It absolutly works 100% when I play it from my comp.
But when I try to from that host site it freezes.
Is that site bad or something?

I&#39;m going to try to get a new source but here is what I think is wrong about that:
1. Will the client and the source be the same? If not does it matter???
2. If downloading then new source i have to 1st take my ip off the old one before putting my ip on the new, correct??
3. If a source is the same as in (317) but different in items from the client will that mess it up???</description>

              <p>Well i know that…<br>
That’s why im asking does “anyone” know of a <em>clean</em> client (+) source that you could give me a link to download?<br>
What i ment by that was: It’s not leached, It’s not buged or glitched, and its a amazing sever for a starter to download.<br>
I want the server to be able to put my ip in. I have a website and i want the server to be my game of the site. If absolutly anyone knows of a <em>clean</em> client (+) source THATS CUSTOMIZABLE with no bugs then please tell me. ( Please give link. )<br>
Or hey, you can give me a walkthrough of how you got your first server online. I had a server i downloaded from here online, its just im not a “good” coder yet and i didnt know how to fix that damn shop glitch so i got pissed and deleted the server. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> now i cant find it, and all the other servers i download are fin LEACHED!@@!!@@!</p>
