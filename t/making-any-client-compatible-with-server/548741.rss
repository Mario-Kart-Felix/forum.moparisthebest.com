    <title>Making any client compatible with server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-any-client-compatible-with-server/548741</link>
    <description>I understand that there&#39;s things that have to do with HexInts and stuff but I don&#39;t exactly know how everything works. Could someone give me a brief summary on how to make a client compatible with your server?

I&#39;m trying to get different 317/377 clients to work with my server, but I haven&#39;t figured out how to.</description>

              <p>You have to make sure the packets (And packet sizes) are correct on both ends, and you need to make sure your NPC/Player updating is the same on both sides (size wise. If you have 12 bits on one end, 12 bits will be on the other).<br>
(This is a PI, but an example)<br>
