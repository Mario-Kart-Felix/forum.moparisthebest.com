[size=10pt]SORRY FOR POSTING THIS HERE! I WASNT SURE IM NEW![/size] &lt;33

Welcome to Stadther Games! 

[size=14pt]Here is the website[/size] [URL=http://&quot;http://stadthergames.com/&quot;]http://stadthergames.com/[/URL]

Firstly, I would like to thank you for taking time to read my thread. Let me tell you a little about our company and what we do as a team. We focus on the matter of customer happiness, and also making new friends in a new community! Our staff consists of multiple people, here is our current staff list:

Tim S: Administrative Owner/Founder, Game Development,Graphics
Cory S: Administrative C.E.O, Game Development, Graphics
Hunter A: Administrative Assistant, Game Development
Carl A: Forum Moderator
Zackarie M: Game Development

What exactly is Stadther Games all about?
A: As a team we create PC games using a program called Game Maker. Some of our staff members use the original version, and some of us like myself use the Game Maker Studio with the HTML5 module. Using that module we are able to implement games directly to our website. As a team our goal is to provide games at a cheap price, and HTML5 games for free on our site!


I want to join the team please, how do I do that?
Joining the team consists of passing our training course which is available to anyone that requests it. If you do pass our training course you will get your very own certification, and a rank on the forums. Please be aware, that being apart of the team requires regular activity, an participation. Here are some of the requirements needed to join the team:

1) Must have Skype
2) Must be active with our staff

That&#39;s everything you need to now about joining our team, but that&#39;s not even the fun part! Imagine being able to create a platform game, with ray guns, swords, and even whips! All of this can be done in Game Maker, and we are here to help you learn how to do certain functions &amp; actions! I know, I know, everyone is waiting to see what I have ins tore for you today as far as media, well take a look for yourself:
