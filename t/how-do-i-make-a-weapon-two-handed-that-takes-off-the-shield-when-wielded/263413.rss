    <description>Okay well I have dragon claws and I want to make it so that when you wield it, it takes the shield of and says , you can not wield a two-handed weapon with a shield, but how and these are the codes I already have...

[code]    public static int more2handed[] = {7158, 1319, 6528, 14915, 13653, 13664};

    public static int more2handed() {
        return more2handed[more2handed.length];
    }

    public boolean item2handed(int ID) {
        if (ID == 1) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }[/code]

[code]            if (targetSlot == playerWeapon
                    &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerShield] != -1
                    &amp;&amp; (Item.itemTwoHanded[wearID] == true
                            || item2handed(wearID) == true)) {
                remove(playerEquipment[playerShield], playerShield);
            }
            if (targetSlot == playerWeapon) {
                SendWeapon(wearID, GetItemName(wearID));
                playerSE = GetStandAnim(wearID);
                playerSEW = GetWalkAnim(wearID);
                playerSER = GetRunAnim(wearID);
                playerSEA = 0x326;
                if (item2handed(wearID) == true) {
                    playerSE = 0x811;
                    playerSEW = 0x67F;
                    playerSER = 0x680;
                }[/code]

[code]                if (wearSlot == 5 &amp;&amp; is2Hander()) {
                    sendMessage(
                            &quot;Two handed item = You cant equip a 2hander with a shield&quot;);
                } else if (playerEquipment[playerShield] != -1
                        &amp;&amp; wearID == twoHanderz[I]) {
                    sendMessage(&quot;You cant equip a two-hand weapon with a shield&quot;);
                } else {
                    wear(wearID, wearSlot);
                }
            }[/code]</description>
