    <title>Not Gaining Any XP at All - PI - Pics Included -</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/not-gaining-any-xp-at-all-pi-pics-included/469122</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve been working on my server, adding little things here and there and today I decided to test a lot of things out by playing as a regular player and seeing what needs work.

But, first thing I do is train, and I&#39;m not gaining any xp, and I cannot for the life of me figure out why...

If anyone has any idea, please let me know what classes to post or whatever, I&#39;ll cooperate any way I can. I just hope that I don&#39;t get called a noob for something simple :D Thanks!

Also, getting this error when I run the server - [IMG]http://puu.sh/1rGkG[/img]</description>
