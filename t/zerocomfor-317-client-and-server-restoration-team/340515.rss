    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/zerocomfor-317-client-and-server-restoration-team/340515</link>
    <description>I am currently trying to bring back the prime era of the 06&#39; 07&#39; rsps. This is unofficial as of right now because it&#39;s just me and my client with an old ddsp3ced source. We will be using a cluttered butterscape client and I haven&#39;t found the &quot;perfect&quot; server so far (i have more experience with clients than of servers.)

What i need
[code]Server:
a new server source (preferably blank) that some one could start coding[/code]
[code]Client: nothing so far[/code]

here is my work (i have been doing this for 2 days)
