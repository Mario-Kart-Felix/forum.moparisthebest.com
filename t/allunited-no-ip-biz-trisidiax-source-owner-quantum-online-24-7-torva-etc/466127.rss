    <description>http://www.rswebclients.com/play/allunited for our webclient

Pics? got no pics, but still if you just click the webclient and just look around on the server you get a bigger picture :)

Owner-Quantum

We normally have around 8 players around but right now just 4 due to the fact that i am hosting at my house and cant keep it 24 7 because sometimes my pc shuts off for some reason. Not to the fact that i have a shit pc but because i have workers at my place for now.</description>
