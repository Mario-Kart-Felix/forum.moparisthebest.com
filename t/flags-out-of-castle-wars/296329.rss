    <description>Happened August 20, 2009 @ 2:00AM

I thought it was rather interesting, a couple people there were saying it was noclip, there was also a player moderator there who didn&#39;t report them but rather encouraged them.

I’ve actually wondered how castle wars works for a while. Are the battleground and waiting room sections actually within a single region, which means that people are declared ‘in-game’ by being within this region?<br>
It may well have been related to clipping, but this all depends on how the server maintains the group of players that are currently within the game.</p>
<p>For example, if they maintained the players by adding them to a collection of some sort (after teleporting them into the battleground part when the game starts) then the two guys holding the flags would have been subject to the same game mechanics that everyone else is subject to (ie, they’d be teleported back into the lobby after the game finishes, and if they had the flag equipped then it would be removed from them), despite being outside of the game area.</p>
<p>If however the game didn’t finish as written above (ie, everyone within the region was teleported to the lobby and so on) then leaving the region would exempt you from this ‘game over’ process, thus allowing them to keep the flags.</p>
<p>There’s really nothing wrong with the second solution because you can usually expect that clipping won’t be an issue, meaning the players could never leave without the game ending or the use of the portal in the respawn room.<br>
[/quote]<br>
But if they manage to get out via standard channels ie using the portal to leave then the portal will remove them from the shortlist of players who are currently playing thus allowing them to keep the flag because they wont get teleported to the lobby when the game finishes because they are no longer part of the game[/quote]<br>
Can’t usually get to the portal if you have the flag equipped, though. :o</p>
