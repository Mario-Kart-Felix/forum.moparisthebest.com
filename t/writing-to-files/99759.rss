    <description>Ok so i have this void:


[code]public void Savechars() {

	sendMessage(&quot;Updated On My Server! Just in case something&quot;);
	sendMessage(&quot;BAD happens, i&#39;ll have your stats here!&quot;);     
      BufferedWriter bw = null;
try {
	bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;stats.txt&quot;, true));
       bw.write(playerName+&quot; Skills:&quot;+playerLevel[0]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[1]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[2]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[3]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[4]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[5]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[6]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[7]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[8]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[9]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[10]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[11]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[12]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[13]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[14]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[15]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[16]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[17]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[18]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[19]+&quot;, &quot;+playerLevel[20]+&quot;, &quot;+playerRights);
       bw.newLine();
       bw.flush();
      } catch (IOException ioe) {
        ioe.printStackTrace();
      } finally {
        if (bw != null) try {
     bw.close();
        } catch (IOException ioe2) {
     sendMessage(&quot;Updated!&quot;);
        }
      }
}[/code]

and its suppose to write to stats.txt just incase something major happens i would have their stats there so noone would lie they have this high attk, def, range, etc. I would just look into the file and see the stats. 

well when i compile i get no errors, and everything, and i can use the command to save the stats,

but the problem im having is, if i use the command it keeps making a new line even with the same name. i want it to replace the current stats with the new ones, once their updated. get me?

For Example:

Let&#39;s say:

On May 21 I used the command &quot;save&quot; which triggers the void &quot;Savechars() {&quot;. and it succesfully wrote to stats.txt.

Then:

On May 22nd, i used the command again &quot;save&quot; which triggered the void &quot;Savechars() {&quot;, but it makes a new line with the updated stats, i want it to replace the existing one with the updated line of stats, so i would have to look through the whole thing.

Hope you understand me.</description>
