    <title>Virtualization across a few computers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/virtualization-across-a-few-computers/416553</link>
    <description>Or cloud computing. I want to know the drawbacks. I&#39;m seriously thinking about trying this idea unless there&#39;s a good reason not to.

Anyone remember Helmer, the 24-core setup in the IKEA Helmer cabinet? I&#39;d build something very similar if not the same thing just up to date. The big difference is that I would use something like Eucalyptus to create one computer scaled across all of them, having 24 cores and 96GB of RAM. I&#39;m interesting in what I would need to do to cut down on network time between the machines.

I want to do this because having many computers is not an issue for me, it&#39;s having many licenses to many programs for each one. Although, each rendering license can be bought as an &quot;unlimited core&quot; license that can be used on one computer with X amount of cores. They do this to stay future sighted.</description>

              <p>ffmpeg is free and open source, I’d suggest you try to consolidate your processing on that so you don’t have to go through all this ridiculousness.</p>
<p>But anyway, I’m guessing you are going for something like this:<br>
<a href="http://helmer.sfe.se/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://helmer.sfe.se/</a><br>
?  I think that is what you referenced in your first post.</p>
<p>I’d say just google around for other people that have done similar things and wrote anything up about them, like this dated article:<br>
<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Cluster-HOWTO.html" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Cluster-HOWTO.html</a></p>
<p>The only problem I think you might run into is running windows programs on it, I’m sure you can run Windows with KVM inside the cluster, but I don’t know if windows will support all that memory and CPU cores, and how well it will work.  For running Linux applications I’m sure everything will work perfectly.</p>

              <p>After Effects would be the only one that would have to be run via Windows. Other than that, The Foundry’s Nuke, Pixar’s Renderman Pro Server, Mental Ray, and ffmpeg.</p>
<p>The way everything works now is that we have many quad-core machines that each would need a quad-core license to render. We need as much power as we can get. The real motivator is that you have to buy a dual, quad, or unlimited license per machine.</p>
<p>With this, we would be running all those machines as one or two massive machines, thus only needed two unlimited core licenses.</p>

              <p>I know you can do it with Linux, I think as you said the major bottleneck is the networking between computers, but I’d think a 1Gbit connection or so would be plenty fast enough.  I’m not sure it is the answer to your problem though, what about a licensed program on a network share that can be used by many computers?  What programs are you talking about?</p>
