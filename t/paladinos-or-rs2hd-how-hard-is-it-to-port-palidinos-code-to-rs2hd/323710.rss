    <title>Paladinos or RS2HD? How hard is it to port Palidinos code to RS2HD?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paladinos-or-rs2hd-how-hard-is-it-to-port-palidinos-code-to-rs2hd/323710</link>
    <description>I do not play Runescape anymore (quit 2 years ago) but would like to make a server, without hosting it just for fun and to learn some Java. I want to know what are the advantages of Paladino or RS2Hd, or any others. It seems Paladino has a lot of tutorials around, if i go with something else, just how difficult is it to modify premade code? I have done programming before and i am not a complete noob at it, but im not a pro either.

Edit: Wow just noticed RS2HD uses MINA so it should be a lot more stable and able to hold a ton more players, so the  question now is: How hard is it to port code from tutorials for Paladino into RS2HD?</description>
