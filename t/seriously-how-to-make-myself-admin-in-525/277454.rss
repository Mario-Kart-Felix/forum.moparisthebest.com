    <title>Seriously, how to make myself admin in 525?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/seriously-how-to-make-myself-admin-in-525/277454</link>
    <description>Okay call me noob or quote me,I know how to do it in 508s and 317s where you just go into character logs, but I just downloaded Berky-scape and everything is way different, I went into &quot;io&quot; and changed his name to mine and still didnt work, i dont think the compiling is working tho because its saying this.

javac: file not found: *.java
Usage: javac &lt;options&gt; &lt;source files&gt;
use -help for a list of possible options
Finished!
Press any key to continue . . .

but his compiler was saying could not be found so i replaced it with my 508 one.

and yeah i think berky is 508 but its hd so w/e, im calling it 525.</description>

There’s really no point. Unless you crave for a pointless crown, I don’t really see the need. Every 525 you see has no admin commands.</p>
