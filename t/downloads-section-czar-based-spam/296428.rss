    <title>Downloads section: Czar-based = spam?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/downloads-section-czar-based-spam/296428</link>
    <description>Personally, I think there should be a new rule in the downloads section:

If your server is Czar based [b]AND[/b] you haven&#39;t removed at least 5K lines from it. [b]DON&#39;T POST[/b]

I also have other views.

E.g everything in downloads section should be deleted and future posts should be examined by mods first. By deleted I mean moved to say an archives or some shizz. If they can&#39;t be examined by mods first I reckon there should be either a post amount or rep amount needed to post a [b]server[/b]. 

If none of these can be achieved simply locking servers with incorrect credits, next to no adjustments or with more thank 20K lines in one file (E.g badly coded) will suffice for a time.

Don&#39;t even get me started about what handlers should be neccassary before a server is allowed to be released.</description>

              <p>Yeah. Devo 2.7 is good. So wL shouldnt be banned. But Czar is a crappy 317. Delta aint that good too. Im not saying to ban the 317’s but I’m saying what I hate.</p>

              <p>I myself have recently made Tasahm-scape which was my attempt at this. Everyone seems to like the things from Reapage-scape etc. So I made a Devolution 2.4 (Unpackaged) based server which had all the features of a Czar (Like the skilling area etc). I didn’t copy and paste these, except the objects (Which I loaded the correct way), I wrote them out using a void and switch statements which is the correct way. My hope was is that some noobs would download it and go ‘you can code without using 20 lines an object?’ WOW!</p>

<p>I also disagree with devolution and Iclarity being stickied.<br>
They are nothing compared to the stuck frameworks.[/quote]</p>
<p>They have features. The stuck frameworks are completely useless to people who have no idea how to code. They are never going to be used by them. Unless someone who knows how to do it (Unlike me) goes and adds some decent features to them they are just gonna sit there only being used by the people who are really good at this.</p>

              <p>Personally, I think there should be a new rule in the downloads section:</p>
<p>If your server is Czar based <span class="bbcode-b">AND</span> you haven’t removed at least 5K lines from it. <span class="bbcode-b">DON’T POST</span></p>
<p>I also have other views.</p>
<p>E.g everything in downloads section should be deleted and future posts should be examined by mods first. By deleted I mean moved to say an archives or some shizz. If they can’t be examined by mods first I reckon there should be either a post amount or rep amount needed to post a <span class="bbcode-b">server</span>.</p>
<p>If none of these can be achieved simply locking servers with incorrect credits, next to no adjustments or with more thank 20K lines in one file (E.g badly coded) will suffice for a time.</p>
<p>Don’t even get me started about what handlers should be neccassary before a server is allowed to be released.</p>
