<ul>
<li>99 Woodcutting</li>
<li>99 Firemaking</li>

<p>Botted like 20 hours a day, and both accounts were not banned before the 99 firemaking account got banned 13 days a week ago because I was having fun. Lol.</p>

              <p>They banned my skiller right when I got 97 firemaking. Thing is that I stopped botting for a whole month and got 97 firemaking by myself.</p>
<p>I did bot woodcutting though so that’s why I got banned. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
