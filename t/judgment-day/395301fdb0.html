<p>Obviously the christians who make these predictions haven’t read that no one except God knows when judgment day is. Not even jesus knows. So I dismiss any prediction of the end of days. Revelations describes the events of the endtime. So that is the only way to know when humans will meet there end. The only time I would believe is if we were in defcon 5(or which ever number is the worst one) but even then I know some ppl would survive that.</p>

<p>No. However, I could provide a number of things to persuade you that God isn’t real, but I won’t.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the Bible, after the flood is released, God tells Moses he will never massacre the human race is one foul blow again. And he sure as hell wouldn’t let his son do it.</p>

        <p>[quote=“xryz, post:50, topic:395301”]Your arguement that God doesnt exist is as weak or weaker than my arguement that he does. how can u detect a being that does not reside in this realm?</p>
<p>here is one thing. how is someone being a christian have any thing to do with(effecting) you? what do u have to lose at being a christian? ok lets say that both you and I live very successful lives. now lets say you were right, and I die, now i am dead, i am nothing, i no longer exist. now lets say God exists, you die, now u are going to hell b/c you were told that God exists and how to not go to hell yet you consciencely refuse to believe what you were told. so why are you gambling your soul? there is no reason at all. another gamble would u rather have a gun and never have to use it, than to not have a gun and need one for self-defense? point being it better to be safe than sorry, so if u lose either of those gambles you are screwed.</p>
<p>can see light? as far as i know u can see the source emitting the photons, and what light reflect off of, but u cant see light really, does that mean light doesnt exist? no. just b/c u see chris mindfreak do something in person does that mean he did it? no, it was a mere illusion. the point with the previous sentence is to say just b/c u have proof doesnt mean its real. if there was a deaf, blind person, how does that person know that the world exists? they dont, yet it still does.</p>
<p>if we find out that we in fact are the only planet with life and that there is no sign of lifes existence ever on any other planet, would u still believe there is no God? if you believe is ET life why do u believe in it and dont believe in God? there is no scientific proof that shows that it exists. you are entirely dependent on hearsay.</p>
<p>u want evidence? ok find a spirit filled church, practice the religion avidly, practice it like you mean it. meaning you have no side thoughts of it not being true, and that u make urself believe God is real; after a certaint amount of time lets say a year or more. if you dont get your proof from that then you can leave and live your life how u have been. why ppl believe is b/c you feel God when you are doing what you are suppose to, and worshipping him. if ppl didnt feel this why would they believe in him?</p>
<p>want more proof? look for true miracles. there have been ppl born blind and God made it where they could see. ppl get cancer and ppl pray then very soon they are healed and doctors can no longer find any signs of cancer. you are blind to all the examples that prove God exists. for real, but im not offended if you dont believe b/c I know im safe, and you are the only one in danger if you dont heed my warning.</p>
<p>all points being your logic to disprove God are all flawed. he cant be disproved until you have proof that he is just made up.</p>
<p>note: sorry there may be typos, as with all my posts, i usually dont reread what i write so i post after i type it up. also there are other things i believe i wanted to say but i believe i forgot what i was wanting to say as i wrote this post.[/quote]</p>
<p>Just saying, but what evidence do you have of this “realm” existing? i would like to see somthing.<br>
Also take one of the most spoken phrases out of the bible “the lord is my sheppard”. now think about that, What does it really mean?<br>
Heres my interpretation of that:</p>
<p>1: What are Sheppard?<br>
They are people, like you and i, who have followers, in this case the sheep.</p>
<p>2: what do those sheep do?<br>
They blindly follow this Sheppard, and know little about him, Thay do not know their what this sheppard might do to them, but they follow him anyway.</p>
<p>3: What does this Sheppard do with these sheep?<br>
He makes a profit from them, they do not know this, but he does (Just think of people like priests)</p>
<p>4: How much of a free live do these sheep have?<br>
Well apart from eating and sleeping, pratically none, i know, inside that they want to be free, prancing around on the hills, having a happy time, rather than be hearded up.</p>

Theres no gain in ever using them, the US and China know that both of them will never use nukes under any circumstances, but they keep them so the smaller countries who have a small amount and are willing to do so wont take the world hostage.</p>

[/quote]<br>
No. However, I could provide a number of things to persuade you that God isn’t real, but I won’t.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the Bible, after the flood is released, God tells Moses he will never massacre the human race is one foul blow again. And he sure as hell wouldn’t let his son do it.[/quote]</p>
<p>u mess heard this or are misquoting, he said he would never flood the earth like he did nothing about not wiping out the human race ever again. also what are these things that u speak of that would persuade someone to not believe?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/kingman.html">@kingman</a> yes you can be a christian without going to church. going to church doesnt make u a christian, in fact there are many ppl that attend church who are not saved. you must be baptized and accept jesus as ur lord and savior. you must choose ur church wisely and one that is spirit fill, doing Gods will or u will be lead astray, also if u dont go to church you are making yourself an easy target for the devil.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/shrogg.html">@shrogg</a> how do u expect me to prove this claim when is a concept far to complex for a human mind to comprehend? we have no way to know if there are things smaller than subatomic particles, what encompasses the universe, the list can go on and on; point being we would not have any technology in the next 1000+ years to detect realms. shepperd in this text they mean a protector, like a father, he watchs over us, and when just one person runs off he leaves the herd to go find them because each and everyone of us are equally important to him. he is our father, and we are part of him(his breath is living and every breath he takes is a spirit wanting to come to earth. [ that isnt really frm the bible but a part of an out of body experience pastor jesse duplantis had]).</p>

However, shepherd can be interpreted in other ways. In a way, the shepherd protects the sheep from the wolf - you can just assume Moses was the shepherd’s true, faithful dog who helps shepherd us. You are also thinking of this bluntly, but tell me this: would God really tell us he is protecting us only to be slaughtered? Why would you do that? I don’t really see that as something that helps your cause greatly.</p>

<p>@ xryz<br>
You said one needs to be baptized and saved to go to heaven but that isn’t true. You need to be saved to go to heaven. If you want to join the Lord’s table, you must be baptized. Baptizing just means that you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Saviour and you publicly announced it.</p>
