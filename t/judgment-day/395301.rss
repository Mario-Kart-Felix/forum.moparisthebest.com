    <description>I find it odd that no one in this flame-happy community has brought this up so I guess I might as well. Apparently the Christians are saying that May 21&#39;st is going to be judgment day, or for those of you who didn&#39;t grow up in the south with rednecks yelling bible verses at people even though they can&#39;t read, the day that Jesus will come to earth and yada yada we all screwed. Now they say that we will be able to tell by if (you guessed it) gay people get rights. Even thought im scared to say it (this is going to be fuuuunnnnn) discuss.</description>

<p>No. That is the day the world is supposed to end. Apparently, only a select few were raptured, excluding the guy who came up with the idea in the first place. It’s may 21st: Rapture, October 21st: the end of the world.</p>

i believe that the ppl that actually know what the bible says about the end time will know when the end time is near. the bible say what will be happening when that time comes, ppl just talk about stuff they dont know.</p>
<p>if u dont know Jesus died, then 3 days later he rose–he roamed the earth for months afterwards, and talked with his disciples. and he left the holy spirit for his followers. it says all that in the bible after his death if u would like to read that–, if u dont believe that then that is practically the only thing that separates Christianity from Judaism; belief-wise i mean they have a ton of different customs between the two. im pretty sure jesus is suppose to come from the east of Jerusalem not from korea.</p>
<p>also if the rapture did happen im sure u would know about it on the news when a large amount of ppl just vanish of the face of the earth(that would just make sense to me, even if there was just a small amount of worthy ppl). Like i said I believe in God, that Jesus rose, and in the end times but its going to take a lot more than ppl make predictions(that is how Mormons or some other denomination of Christianity started, someone know he was able to convince gullible ppl in to believing in a messed up, twisted version of Christianity) like these to believe the end time has happened or is very soon to happen. If ppl read the bible in revelations it tells you what to expect.<br>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Some of you may have already seen my thread about the prophet Vanga.</p>
<p>Here’s something similar to the topic i have found:</p>
<blockquote>Apocalypse: The Last Days
<p>Vanga calls us to look seriously the prophecies in the Bible: “What is written in the Bible will come true! Apocalypse is coming! You do not, but your children will survive to witness it!” But she says “there will be no catastrophes, nor flood. There awaits us atleast 1000 years of peace and prosperity.”</p>
<p>Described in the Bible the returning of God (Not sure if she actually says “God” because I used a translator, i think it’s “Father”) who will bring change to world peace and prosperity will become in the next generation after Vanga. According to her words it should be done in 20 years, somewhere in 2010. According to her, it seems that he has already come, but the changes it will bring will become visible only after time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another interesting thing:</p>
<blockquote>"The time has come for miracles and science will make major discoveries in the field of the intangible" Vanga predicted. It really will cause a "consciousness of humanity" for which she speaks. People will realize her words: "After our death we will have to respond to our matters "and will change the ways and thoughts to doing good. Humanity will understand that after death we continue to live in the spiritual world.
<p>"Scientists will discover many facts about the future of our planet and the galaxy/space. You’ll find data on the old sacred books. Many mysteries will be solved. "</p>
<p>Another Korean book with prophecies of a thousand years ago also predicted similar changes: Since the beginning of 21 century will dramatically change the direction of world opinion. Limit the scientific worldview and depletion of natural reserves, problems with the territory and population, emphasized unilateral development of science and technology relative decline of technological progress, desperate efforts of developing countries in an attempt to catch up with developed - these are factors that will change the destiny of humanity and according to Korean prophecies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new messiah will come from East (Korea). Nostradamus has said it also, tamara globa.</p>
<p>Tbh, i believe every single word of her because she has predicted so many stuff that came true and it just cannot be coinsidences, also has helped people getting cured by a lot of ways way before medicine was good like today.</p>
<p>You may see no God for now but life is full of surprises.</p>
