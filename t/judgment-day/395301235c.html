We have dead bodys on account for no pictures. Untill i see their dead bodys wrapped in toilet paper, i will not believe in these absurd storys!

<p>Moses wrote the torah. Moses also wrote the first 5 books of the old testament.</p>
<p>The bible was written by a number of different people over a span of 2000 years. Saying that “The one person who wrote the bible is schizophrenic” is completely ignorant.</p>

        <p>[quote=“xryz, post:123, topic:395301”]i believe that the ppl that actually know what the bible says about the end time will know when the end time is near. the bible say what will be happening when that time comes, ppl just talk about stuff they dont know.</p>
<p>if u dont know Jesus died, then 3 days later he rose–he roamed the earth for months afterwards, and talked with his disciples. and he left the holy spirit for his followers. it says all that in the bible after his death if u would like to read that–, if u dont believe that then that is practically the only thing that separates Christianity from Judaism; belief-wise i mean they have a ton of different customs between the two. im pretty sure jesus is suppose to come from the east of Jerusalem not from korea.</p>
<p>also if the rapture did happen im sure u would know about it on the news when a large amount of ppl just vanish of the face of the earth(that would just make sense to me, even if there was just a small amount of worthy ppl). Like i said I believe in God, that Jesus rose, and in the end times but its going to take a lot more than ppl make predictions(that is how Mormons or some other denomination of Christianity started, someone know he was able to convince gullible ppl in to believing in a messed up, twisted version of Christianity) like these to believe the end time has happened or is very soon to happen. If ppl read the bible in revelations it tells you what to expect.[/quote]</p>

<p>No. That is the day the world is supposed to end. Apparently, only a select few were raptured, excluding the guy who came up with the idea in the first place. It’s may 21st: Rapture, October 21st: the end of the world.</p>
<p>Don’t worry Harold, everyone makes mistakes, it’s not the end of the world.<br>
