<p>I believe that’s why they are called theory’s?<br>
Take a look at this "God’ thing, Where is there any evidence that he actually exists?<br>
And the bible never uses “and he may of said” instead it just states everything in the context of it being true.<br>
I think that is where science wins, they dont admit to the theory being real. they state some mathematical evidence and maby a few cases when the phenomenon my of occurred.</p>

<p>People 2000 years ago thought differently than people do now, And today in a modern, civilized society There are so many things that prove the bible to be, lets put this nicely (i don’t want to offend anyone more than i am) a load of shit.<br>
take evolution for example, It has been proven wrong on so many levels, yet people STILL believe in creationism? WHAT.</p>
<p>and anyway, wasn’t the bible written like, 700 years after it actually was ment to take place? so indeed, these are actually stories told and passed down through generations, just like a giant game of pass the lie to your children.<br>
Better yet, The bible is a “popular myth book”, there, that describes it, as myths are things that aren’t true, but aren’t false, Yes, their might be a bit of truth in it, but the blatant lies out weigh them.</p>

        <p>Your arguement that God doesnt exist is as weak or weaker than my arguement that he does. how can u detect a being that does not reside in this realm?</p>
<p>here is one thing. how is someone being a christian have any thing to do with(effecting) you? what do u have to lose at being a christian? ok lets say that both you and I live very successful lives. now lets say you were right, and I die, now i am dead, i am nothing, i no longer exist. now lets say God exists, you die, now u are going to hell b/c you were told that God exists and how to not go to hell yet you consciencely refuse to believe what you were told. so why are you gambling your soul? there is no reason at all. another gamble would u rather have a gun and never have to use it, than to not have a gun and need one for self-defense? point being it better to be safe than sorry, so if u lose either of those gambles you are screwed.</p>
<p>can see light? as far as i know u can see the source emitting the photons, and what light reflect off of, but u cant see light really, does that mean light doesnt exist? no. just b/c u see chris mindfreak do something in person does that mean he did it? no, it was a mere illusion. the point with the previous sentence is to say just b/c u have proof doesnt mean its real. if there was a deaf, blind person, how does that person know that the world exists? they dont, yet it still does.</p>
<p>if we find out that we in fact are the only planet with life and that there is no sign of lifes existence ever on any other planet, would u still believe there is no God? if you believe is ET life why do u believe in it and dont believe in God? there is no scientific proof that shows that it exists. you are entirely dependent on hearsay.</p>
<p>u want evidence? ok find a spirit filled church, practice the religion avidly, practice it like you mean it. meaning you have no side thoughts of it not being true, and that u make urself believe God is real; after a certaint amount of time lets say a year or more. if you dont get your proof from that then you can leave and live your life how u have been. why ppl believe is b/c you feel God when you are doing what you are suppose to, and worshipping him. if ppl didnt feel this why would they believe in him?</p>
<p>want more proof? look for true miracles. there have been ppl born blind and God made it where they could see. ppl get cancer and ppl pray then very soon they are healed and doctors can no longer find any signs of cancer. you are blind to all the examples that prove God exists. for real, but im not offended if you dont believe b/c I know im safe, and you are the only one in danger if you dont heed my warning.</p>
<p>all points being your logic to disprove God are all flawed. he cant be disproved until you have proof that he is just made up.</p>
<p>note: sorry there may be typos, as with all my posts, i usually dont reread what i write so i post after i type it up. also there are other things i believe i wanted to say but i believe i forgot what i was wanting to say as i wrote this post.</p>

        <p>Of course I agree with your viewpoint. I simply refuse to believe there is no God, because something must have created all this; it couldn’t have just started out of thin air. The hard part is, however, finding the right religion for you.

I mean, it’s a dilemma that’s been bothering me recently. How do I know that Islam, Christianity or even Judaism is the real religion that god wanted us to follow? Well I made it a goal for me to read all holy books I can, and I will hopefully be done with this in a short time so I can choose which religion to follow, but it’s just something that’s been bothering me for the past few weeks now.</p>

<p>i know. i feel the same way. i mean i would hate to be following my religion(believing that im am doing right) to find out that i have been lead astray, and going to hell, even though my intentions where to follow God and do his will. I would hope God being so merciful that he would see that we were misguided and that we truly were trying to do his will. also I would talk to God and listen to what he says, b/c we are suppose to talk to him daily, i mean reading which ever holy book you read, and listening to whichever sermons you listen to; you have to make sure everything you take in is truly what he wants. i know its hard to find the answer but the best thing i know is to know Gods voice an then talk to him.</p>

I say god doesn’t exist and ask for proof, you say you cant see him.<br>
I say you cant see that “gun” that im holding next to your head.<br>
O wait of course not because it DOSENT exist.<br>
[/quote]<br>
You can’t see air. You know it’s real.<br>
You can’t see what makes up outer space. You know it’s real.<br>
Make a better rebuttal than “I can’t see him so it doesnt exist”.[/quote]There’s multiple gasses in air you can see some of them<br>
Nobody ever said anything about what makes up outer space, We have “theory’s” and they are always changing.<br>
Religion is and always will be fake.</p>

<p>I believe rip4d is right. Nuclear war is the most logical result that could happen in even the next few years. Alqueda already has a new leader, maybe he just wants to use nukes and get this all over quickly.</p>
