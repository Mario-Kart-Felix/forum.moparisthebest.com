    <title>Webclient Website hosting Tips</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-website-hosting-tips/291483</link>
    <description>When picking websites. Most websites that claims they are free web-hosting, usually are! But do you get that website link that you wanted? ([i]ie.[/i] www.google.com, www.moparisthebest.com) No. You get one like these:


   [center][b][u]Freewebs/Webs.com[/u][/b]

[tt]www.your website name.webs.com
www.webs.com/your website name[/tt]

  [b][u]Geocities/Yahoo Webhosting[/u][/b]

[tt]www.geocities.com/YOUR SITE HERE[/tt][/center]

And so on. Now... you can search, hack, and pay but the lowest webhosting for that oh so desired website, is Godaddy.com. For 1.99/Month, you got a deal there. Now, I could blab oh on how many things godaddy.com DOESN&#39;T offer, and how you have to pay (oh no!). But Freewebs/Webs.com offers a builder tool thats easy to use, and very nice. Also, if you think you want to go better you can change your settings from builder to HTML mode, (NOTE: The editor is called WebsEdit). And that will save you some time making HTML crap. GoDaddy is nice. I&#39;ve never really tried Geocities, but I think the web editor is pretty easy. You can get a website domain by Webs.com (formerly Freewebs.com) by getting premium. These are the pricing:
[right][b]
Freewebs: 
[/b]
Starter - 4.19/Month
Premium/EnHanced - 8.33/Month
Pro - 20.83/Month

Advice: If you get a membership and premium, starter, or Pro. DO NOT get the year by year thing. You cannot cancel and you have to pay each month. And you aren&#39;t allowed to change your domain so choose wisely. Also, you will get free email addresses. So lets say, your website is www.colorfulsweater.com (this is my old website), your email will be, say, this: Max@colorfulsweater.com, or Moparscape@colorfulsweater.com. You will get 5 emails for Enhanced and 15 for pro. NO EMAIL ADDRESSES FOR STARTER.

[b]GoDaddy:
[/b]
[tt][b]1 Domain - 1.99/Month[/b][/tt]

Advice: This is not a easy 1,2,3. FREE webhosting website. This is you must buy it in order to get it. So, if you want free website I&#39;d go to : www.webs.com, www.geocitites.com, or  [url=http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=free+web+hosting&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8]&quot;free web hosting&quot;[/url][/right]</description>
