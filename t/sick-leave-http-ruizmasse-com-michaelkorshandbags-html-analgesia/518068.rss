The attack * allegedly by dark and Hispanic youths against a white woman - stirred fears of national violence in the city.The five men had been cleared by a point out judge last year after another man, Matias Reyes, who was previously jailed for other crimes, confessed towards the Central Park invasion. DNA evidence reinforced his claim.Just about all five served prison time.

As JetBlue flight 292 circled the Los Angeles area for three hours to lose off fuel just before attempting an emergency getting Wednesday, many of the people were watching your drama on TV screens at their seats.The plane&#39;s landing gear would not retract and has been stuck in the side to side position after the idea took off from Chad Hope Airport within Burbank, headed for New York.The Airbus A320 first circled the Extended Beach Airport, regarding 30 miles southerly of Burbank, so floor crews could look at the position of the items. Then came your circling over Los Angeles before an emergency landing with Los Angeles International Airport, with sparks flying from the nose gear. No injuries were reported among the 140 individuals and six crew members on board.Passenger Zachary Mastoon, 28, of Brooklyn, said he or she first learned there was trouble on board whenever &quot;Brad Pitt&#39;s face froze&quot; on his screen as he observed &quot;Mr. And Mrs. Smith.&quot;He instructed The Early Show co-anchor Hannah Storm, &quot;The pilot came upon and said, &#39;Ladies along with gentlemen, there is challenge with the landing products. It didn&#39;t fully retract, so we&#39;re inside constant contact with Burbank along with New York, and we&#39;ve been trying to figure out the best strategy.&#39; But I just figured it was 1 less step we would have to take when we got to New York. I thought we might just, well, the landing gear&#39;s already straight down, so we don&#39;t have to allow it to go back down.&quot;Christiana Lund, 25, merely moved to New York through the L.A. region, and had gone to pick up her vehicle, which was with her on the flight.&quot;I think people commenced watching it when we had done the low fly-by throughout Long Beach,In . she told Tornado. &quot;That&#39;s when I started watching. And for me, to start with, it was very scary to view: &#39;Oh, my God, we made the news!&#39; But after awhile, My spouse and i felt it was type of comforting just to know for sure we knew that which was going on. Just in case people on the plane weren&#39;t sharing with us everything that was happening, we had the news to adhere to.&quot;    no previous web site next    1/2  [url=http://ruizmasse.com/ralphlaurenoutlet.html]ralph lauren outlet[/url] 
Fans of the game Monopoly will have yet another choice to help make before landing in Park Place or even passing Go. The very first time in almost half a hundred years, a new playing part has been added to the widely used board game, reports News2 Reporter Morry Alter of Cbs television studios Station WCBS-TV in New York.Parker Brothers introduced Monopoly for the public in 1935, and Hasbro bought Parker within 1991. But those who want to game don&#39;t care about that stuff. They only like to play, and most have their favorite game item.With the introduction with the bag of money, you&#39;ll find 11 Monopoly game items. An informal poll simply by Alter shows that fellas seem to favor the vehicle. Gals don&#39;t identify one game item in particular, but the footwear, the dog, and the mount are among those pointed out. The other pieces include the top hat, your bell, the iron, your cannon, the wheelbarrow, and also the battleship. (Each game also comes with $15,140 in numerous denominations of fake costs.)How was the newest piece chosen? One million and a half Monopoly fans simplified nominees down to a field of three: the moneybag, your piggy bank, and the biplane. Between ideas that did not result in the final cut: your bag of golf clubs and the cat -- most likely to go with the dog.

A few sparks had to fly first, but in the end, reports CBS News Correspondent Came Levinson, Ford became the final of the big 3 automakers to cut an arrangement with the united autoworkers.Employees like Christopher darkish are relieved. &quot;I believe it&#39;s a good idea that they does. I mean I don&#39;t want to become off work at just about all,&quot; he says.Your labor agreement arrived 13 hours right after Friday&#39;s midnight deadline. It turned out a lag that gave workers from some plants an opportunity to walk out, at least temporarily.&quot;Ford electric motor company can be fairly greedy when they want to be. They have around $16 thousand in their account and i also feel like the workers should have some of that money,&quot; says UAW fellow member Willis Courtoise.They apparently started using it. The pact reportedly mirrors those negotiated previously with general motors along with Damlier-Chrysler. Those deals have been proved to include annual raises of 3-percent and a placing your signature to bonus for hourly workers.But money may not have been the key hang-up. In an attempt to save jobs, the union wished to derail Ford&#39;s plan to spin and rewrite off its parts division.&quot;It simply doesn&#39;t have the time, the supervision or the money in order to compete for both car customers and make the top parts in the world,&quot; says industry expert John Casesa.Including the Kia deal, about 475,000 autoworkers will now get annual raises over each of the next 3 years. But Casesa says it will not break the bank or have high of an effect on the economic system. &quot;I don&#39;t think this agreement with the UAW is expensive enough to restart inflation in the Ough.S.,&quot; he admits that.While the Ford contract talks went down to the wire, few people forecasted a lengthy strike. The key reason why, one industry insider says, is that occasions are just too great for either side to want to venture to war.

Researchers have reported one of the links between stress in the workplace and the hardening associated with men&#39;s arteries. Well being Correspondent Dr. Sawzag Hnida of CBS News affiliate KCNC-TV in Colorado reports.While a survey by the University of Southern California School of Medicine discovered that men appear to experience stress in this way, experts say women don&#39;t appear to have this problem whatsoever.How do you know if you&#39;re suffering from stress?
