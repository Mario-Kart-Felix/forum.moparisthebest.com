    <description>Sup playas! It&#39;s been a while. If anyone still reads these forums then this just might be the thread for you!

Do you like animes? Well you&#39;ve come the right place. Do you absolutely hate animes? You&#39;ve also come to the right place.

I have an answer for both types of people: [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan]Attack on Titan[/url]
Summary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For a century the surviving remnants of humankind have lived behind three concentric rings of immense walls which protect them against titans, marauding giant humanoids who seem to have no purpose other than to eat humans. Young Eren is dissatisfied with this, as he feels he is living in a cage and that humanity has grown too complacent. He is proven right when his town, which borders the outermost wall, is attacked and overrun by titans, who (among other people) eat his mother. This drives him to join the military, with whip-smart friend Armin and very capable adopted sister Mikasa in tow, with the ultimate goal of joining the Survey Corps, which forays out on dangerous missions to bring the fight to titans and assess humanity&#39;s hope of regaining lost territory from the titans. First, though, the second-ring city of Trost must be defended when the same immense, skinless titan who broke the gate at the outer ring years earlier appears and does the same there. As casualties mount during the desperate defense of Trost, a completely unexpected new hope emerges: a risky but powerful new weapon which could allow humanity to finally start taking the offensive if only it has the courage and trust necessary to exploit it. As Eren and company discover when they foray out with the Survey Corps, though, hitherto-unanticipated forces exist out in titan territory, and the biggest and most threatening of those may have everything to do with humanity&#39;s newest weapon.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

tldr; - it&#39;s a really well done anime. Jaw dropping visual effects (great art), very graphic for a tv show, the foreshadowing of the entire season is phenomenal, the story is very unique and lastly, it&#39;s considered the next best anime since Naruto and Bleach (lol).


Seriously. If you like cartoons/anime at all, I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it. Honestly, I&#39;m surprised there isn&#39;t a topic already about it. Who&#39;s pumped for season 2?</description>

The world they live in is so day-to-day and stressful that they are always winded up - that’s my take any way. Aside from the main characters who haven’t died, they make humans way to damn stupid and uncoordinated. One scene I remember when “Conny” tries to kill like a 9 meter titan and just straight up misses. They were training for 3 years. 3 years Tabbykiller. How do you just crash into a titan? I understand. Rewatching the 1st season you catch a lot more.</p>

<p>I like the way the entire series is drawn, the graphic style is unique. I think I really like it compared to not liking other animes would be that it’s so realistic. The entire concept of the rest of the human race inside a ~200 mile wall and within that wall are two other walls. Just a very unique concept.</p>
<p>Hopefully they don’t ruin the show in the second season, but so far the manga (what the show is based on) is really good.</p>

You know, just in case”.[/quote]The main giant “Titan” or known as the Colossus Titan wasn’t known about when the walls were originally built and designed. The walls were designed to keep Titans who were less than 60m tall out. The Colossus/Armored titan is why they got screwed over in the first place but before then, Titans that tall were unheard of. (Episodes 1 and 2).</p>
<p>You should watch the dubbed/subbed version online and finish the whole series, its great.</p>

<p>Do you like animes? Well you’ve come the right place. Do you absolutely hate animes? You’ve also come to the right place.</p>
<p>I have an answer for both types of people: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Attack on Titan</a><br>
Summary:</p>
<blockquote>For a century the surviving remnants of humankind have lived behind three concentric rings of immense walls which protect them against titans, marauding giant humanoids who seem to have no purpose other than to eat humans. Young Eren is dissatisfied with this, as he feels he is living in a cage and that humanity has grown too complacent. He is proven right when his town, which borders the outermost wall, is attacked and overrun by titans, who (among other people) eat his mother. This drives him to join the military, with whip-smart friend Armin and very capable adopted sister Mikasa in tow, with the ultimate goal of joining the Survey Corps, which forays out on dangerous missions to bring the fight to titans and assess humanity's hope of regaining lost territory from the titans. First, though, the second-ring city of Trost must be defended when the same immense, skinless titan who broke the gate at the outer ring years earlier appears and does the same there. As casualties mount during the desperate defense of Trost, a completely unexpected new hope emerges: a risky but powerful new weapon which could allow humanity to finally start taking the offensive if only it has the courage and trust necessary to exploit it. As Eren and company discover when they foray out with the Survey Corps, though, hitherto-unanticipated forces exist out in titan territory, and the biggest and most threatening of those may have everything to do with humanity's newest weapon.</blockquote>

<p>tldr; - it’s a really well done anime. Jaw dropping visual effects (great art), very graphic for a tv show, the foreshadowing of the entire season is phenomenal, the story is very unique and lastly, it’s considered the next best anime since Naruto and Bleach (lol).</p>
<p>Seriously. If you like cartoons/anime at all, I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it. Honestly, I’m surprised there isn’t a topic already about it. Who’s pumped for season 2?</p>
