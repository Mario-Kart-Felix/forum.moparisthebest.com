    <title>What would do the best?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-would-do-the-best/547819</link>
    <description>So what revision do you think would be the best to use for a rsps, for somebody with a decent amount of knowledge? So, please don&#39;t have documentation in mind. If you&#39;re going to say something like &quot;317&quot;, please also state if it should be original (no custom loaded data/pure cache), or if it should load a certain revision data (if so, which data).</description>

If you are a decent programmer I don’t think it matters what revision.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t think a programmer should work on a revision they don’t enjoy though. Because if you don’t enjoy what you make then what’s the point?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Other people might not enjoy the version you enjoy. If they don’t enjoy it, you won’t get many players. If you don’t get players then you’ll have less donators. Less donators means you won’t be able to pay for hosting etc. But you enjoy it, so you’ll use your own money because you enjoy it and probably think your advertising sucks unaware other people don’t enjoy it. You’ll use your own money to keep it up. Soon enough you have no money. If you have no money you can’t pay bills. If you can’t pay bills, you’ll have to give up all your personal belongings. Your girlfriend will leave you, lets face it, she ain’t messing with no broke nigga.</p>
<p>At the end of the day… is it really worth it?[/quote]dont let this happen. get direct tv</p>

<p>and also add content like barrows. I’d love a server where all you did were barrows runs and minigames in general, no quests. :)[/quote]<br>
Minigames that unlock quest rewards ;O</p>
