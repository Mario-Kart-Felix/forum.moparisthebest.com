    <description>600 Days to Mars?
A space ship with humans on board can get to the moon in about 3 days. (That is the fastest safe speed for humans to go for some reason).

The moon is 250,000Km away
Mars is 50,000,000 Km away

Do the math, 3(days) times 4(4x250,000 = 1,000,000) times 50 (so 50 million) comes up with the answer of 600.

600 Days in Space? Am I correct or wrong?</description>

              <p>moparscape4lifez, the region between Earth and Mars which would be traversed by a spacecraft is essentially free of matter. Yes, there are tiny particles around the place, but their effect on the shuttle’s speed would be negligible. I think you have forgotten that we have already sent unmanned craft far beyond the edge of our solar system - and they are still traveling at amazing speeds.</p>

<p>You don’t understand how much is 600 days thats nearly 2 years…<br>
for that humans gotta eat for 2 years so u gotta bring a shitload of foods<br>

<p>Wow you’re fucking retarded. If you’re trolling fuck off. If you’re just an inbred crack baby then sit down and be prepared to get educated.</p>
<p>There are ways to grow food in space. The Space Station has a facility to grow plants. You only need fuel for the initial take off, to control rotation and speed, and to return to Earth. Once the ship gets up to the correct speed the jets shut down, and turn on to control the direction. 2 years is nothing at all for a once in a lifetime opportunity. So no, YOU don’t understand.</p>

<p>dude are u fucking stupid. Who the fuck is going to eat tomato’s ok vegetables for 2 years… If i don’t have meat for 1 day… I get headaches its a common human treat all humans are carnivores even those ppl who say they vegetations still have meat sauce on their salads.</p>
<p>Anyways you think space is just a perpetual motion where u set something in motion and it will never stop… but you are wrong… you need alot of gas for it everything slows down… its the basic laws of physics omg… Well yah it takes much slower to slow down in space… so not that much gas is needed little bursts and all… but who is gonna fly in a gliding spaceship thats going at 100 mph …  you wont ever reach it in your lifetime.</p>
<p>But yeah… i guess u could take microwavables into a spaceship they can last forever frozen… and they hardly take up any space rofl.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>your a fucking retard A space shuttle travels way faster then 100mph. Complete guess but I think it is around 20000 around the earth. Anyways there is nothing in space it is a vaccum meaning that there is no friction. The only way for you to slow down is to be pull by gravity into an area which has some type of friciton… God I sound like a retard trying to explain this.[/quote]</p>
<p>omg dude listen to yourself your calling me retarded heheh…<br>
Sometimes i mess up no one is perfect <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> but</p>
<p>I completed physics with a perfect score and I knew everything they were trying to teach me before as common sense. There is always gravity from the pull of super gaints like sun and shit… the bigger a object is the more gravity (PULL it has) mars is like half the earth so the  gravity on mar is half it will do no harm to you!. But coming near something as big as the sun would crush you into a pancake before it bakes you…</p>
<p>You know a black hole could just be 1 piece of mass like a dust with a huge circumference that little piece of dust is right in the center keeps equal gravity all around the blackhole and thats why the gravity is soo huge that it would pull things on it unless you go faster then the pull of gravity onto a side of it so you will stay in perpetual motion of speed but it might slow u down who knowss cuz gravity always pulls thing down.</p>
<p>I said the 100 mph thing as a disadvantage not a advantage, read!</p>
<p>There is no such thing as perpetual motion everything slows down it just depends when that happens. u cant always travel 20000 miles per hour…</p>
<p>secondly learn what friction is… you can’t stop friction its when atoms bounce n rub against each other and create heat… all machines got it… you could slow down friction with COLD. Cold is the law of slowing down atoms but them atoms when they join into modules dunno spellings but whatever they just stand there and jiggling CZ smaller stuff bounces into em! most common example of friction is a when a high amount of electrons pass in your electrical wire it gets hot from all the packed up electrons  I know whatt imma talking bout cuz im going into nanotechnology field in couples of yearz gonna be improvin the world same way i did with private servers <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>There is no Gravity in space,  thus no friction. You get up to the speed you want in a straight course, you then can shut off the engines, and you will continue at that speed forever, until you decide to start the engines again.<br>

<p>I think even if there was no gravity there would still be friction. It’s because space is a vacuum.[/quote]</p>

<p>Afaik, the whole “larger mass = faster” only works in conjunction with gravity.<br>
Anyone feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.</p>

<p>Wow you’re fucking retarded. If you’re trolling fuck off. If you’re just an inbred crack baby then sit down and be prepared to get educated.</p>
<p>There are ways to grow food in space. The Space Station has a facility to grow plants. You only need fuel for the initial take off, to control rotation and speed, and to return to Earth. Once the ship gets up to the correct speed the jets shut down, and turn on to control the direction. 2 years is nothing at all for a once in a lifetime opportunity. So no, YOU don’t understand.<br>

<p>dude are u fucking stupid. Who the fuck is going to eat tomato’s ok vegetables for 2 years… If i don’t have meat for 1 day… I get headaches its a common human treat all humans are carnivores even those ppl who say they vegetations still have meat sauce on their salads.</p>
<p>Anyways you think space is just a perpetual motion where u set something in motion and it will never stop… but you are wrong… you need alot of gas for it everything slows down… its the basic laws of physics omg… Well yah it takes much slower to slow down in space… so not that much gas is needed little bursts and all… but who is gonna fly in a gliding spaceship thats going at 100 mph …  you wont ever reach it in your lifetime.</p>
<p>But yeah… i guess u could take microwavables into a spaceship they can last forever frozen… and they hardly take up any space rofl.[/quote]</p>
<p>your a fucking retard A space shuttle travels way faster then 100mph. Complete guess but I think it is around 20000 around the earth. Anyways there is nothing in space it is a vaccum meaning that there is no friction. The only way for you to slow down is to be pull by gravity into an area which has some type of friciton… God I sound like a retard trying to explain this.</p>

              <p>if humans go to mars by the time they are there, they will be useless, they won’t be able to stand up, their body mass will decrease greatly. due to 0 gravity. but there is a way, in the space craft engineers can make a artificial gravity similar to earth, using centerpital motion, meaning the interior of the space craft will be spinning, thus have acceleration to the center of the ship, causing the normal force and gravity. this can be done easily, and scientists are experimenting with sources of fuel for long tern trips, thus it is possible.  also university of waterloo (thats where i’ll be going) they have found developed a theory based on the quantum model of the atom, a possible teleportation. since an electron can be at 2places at same time ( though its not clear) according to one law is the momentum of an electron is known its position can not be.</p>
<p>anyways science is growing at a fast rate and i’m sure many of us here don’t even know half the discoveries that are been/being made. also few 100 years ago we looked up and said that is the realm of the gods ( or thats where heaven is) now we are exploring it and we still can’t find ne god, neway i am sure that we will travel the universe one day, if extinction doesn’t get us.</p>

<p>Ehrm… Once you are in space… thre is no friction so you cant stop once you start moving… so if you blast yourself at 1200mph into space and shut off you engine once you are out of the earth and moon’s gravitational pull you would continue to go that speed.</p>

<p>That’s why you use it’s gravity to your advantage by sling shotting around it. Thankfully the only mass large enough to effect the shuttles launch would be the Moon, and they’re already using that to get up to speed.</p>
<p>moparscape4lifez, you have no idea what you are talking about. The most recent Mars trip used the exact same method of travel I described. It is documented look it up. They only used fuel to realign themselves.[/quote]<br>
The best is to first go to Mars and then shoot up with real power there.<br>
Moon have only the 1/6 gravity that the Earth have and then you don’t waste to much power to get out from the gravity field and you get greater speed to Mars, the trip could then take less than 600 days.</p>

<p>You don’t understand how much is 600 days thats nearly 2 years…<br>
for that humans gotta eat for 2 years so u gotta bring a shitload of foods<br>
and also you need enough gas to get there so your spaceship gotta be as big as a empire state building</p>

<p>Ehrm… Once you are in space… thre is no friction so you cant stop once you start moving… so if you blast yourself at 1200mph into space and shut off you engine once you are out of the earth and moon’s gravitational pull you would continue to go that speed.<br>
