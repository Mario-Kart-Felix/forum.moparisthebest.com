    <description>[B]Latest Revision: 15[/B]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

P.S. To set this up, compile the source with netbeans, and include the mysql-connector jar. Sorry that there&#39;s no guide for this, there is at RaGEZONE, but it&#39;s not my thread, so I can&#39;t really re-make the thread here. I put the trackbacks to the original thread and guide :coolface:.

[B]HEY GUYS, I&#39;m hiring developers to continue this project of OdinScape! Considering I stopped developing for it for a while. Please apply by PM&#39;ing me! I hope to be seeing a lot of applicants! ;)[/B]

Hey there guys, I decided to release this source to you guys so that YOU guys can help make this source better, since the fact that this source development is dead, and only a once in a while thing for me now. So take this and make me proud. Show me you can get it far.

This is based off of EvilScape V.02, which was based off of a clean Pali 508, which was deleted the day after it came out due to the owner not wanting leeches taking his good source, THEN re-released and is still out there til&#39; this day. I&#39;m about to show that that there are some non-leechers out there.

[COLOR=Blue][B]Features:[/B][/COLOR]
[code]- Admins never get damaged.
- MySQL Support.
- Cached drops.
- Everything from EvilScape V.02 Source.
- If you were to code Player Commands, they wouldn&#39;t use &quot;::&quot;, they will use &quot;!&quot;.
- All player commands were removed, we HATE player commands.
- Full-Screen! (BUGGY).
AND A LOT OF MORE FEATURES, I&#39;M JUST TOO LAZY TO TYPE THEM ALL HERE :P.[/code][COLOR=DarkOrange][B]Revisions Information:
[/B][/COLOR][code]Rev 1:

Rev 9:

- Grammar fixes.

Rev 10:
- More cleanup, grammar fixes, and re-wrote some messages.

Rev 11:
