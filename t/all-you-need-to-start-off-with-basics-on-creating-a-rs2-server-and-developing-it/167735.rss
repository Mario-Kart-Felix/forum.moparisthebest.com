Requirements
Installing Java
Setting Environment Variables
Downloading WinRar
Downloading Client
Downloading Source
Setting-Up No-Ip and Hamachi
Getting No-Ip To Work

1. Requirements

To get your server working you comply to the following requirements:

256 MB Ram
Java Installed - Read Step 2
A Working Client
A Source

2. Installing Java

The latest version of Java is JDK 6u1
[URL=http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp]Download JDK 6u1[/URL]

When you click on the link this page will load up:
[IMG]http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/5779/javadownloadnz8.png[/img]

Click on Download next to JDK 6u1

Click accept and it should refresh the page to look like this:
[IMG]http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/9615/javainstallxe8.png[/img]

Tick the box then choose which way you want to download:
Offline or Online Installation

Well Done! You have installed the latest version of java!

3. Setting Environment Variables:
To allow your computer to run the server you need to set your environment variables

First open my computer, then right-click on my computer and click properties

Now click on advanced

This Is What It Should Look Like:
[IMG]http://img170.imageshack.us/img170/1814/enviromentvariableseo5.png[/img]

Ok near the bottom it says Enviroment Variables

Click on that, and a new window looking like this should open:
[IMG]http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/9301/newenvvxu3.png[/img]

Under [QUOTE]System Variables[/QUOTE] Click the New button and a new window opens up.

For the Variable Name Put: classpath
For the value put: C:\Program Files\Java\Java\jdk1.6.0_01\bin\

Now click OK

Now look for a variable in System Variable called path. Highlighting, by clickin on it once, and click EDIT.

Rename it: PATH
Replace the value with this: [QUOTE]%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\Sy stem32\Wbem;C:\Program Files\QuickTime\QTSystem\;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_11\bin[/QUOTE]

Click OK then Ok again and that&#39;s it
[SIZE=7][b]
FOR THIS TO WORK PROPERLY YOU MUST RESTART YOUR COMPUTER[/b][/SIZE]

4. Getting WinRar

To start off with your private servers you will need Winrar. IT is the base to downloading nearly everything to do with private servers.

[URL=http://www.download.com/WinRAR/3000-2250_4-10614813.html?tag=lst-0-2]WinRar[/URL]

5. Download A Client
To play private servers you need to have a client. Moparscape is the first, and basic client to use. I recommend that you use it, unless you want to use someone else&#39;s.

[URL=http://rs95.rapidshare.com/files/28641428/MoparScapeInstall.exe]Download MoparScape 3.2 With Aryan[/URL]

6. Downloading A Source
To make &quot;YOUR&quot; own private server you need a source to work it. Here are some common sources.
[URL=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=16KZIJK5]Pimpscape[/URL]

[URL=http://rapidshare.de/files/32630302/Project16_V.6.rar.html]Project 16 V 6[/URL]

[URL=http://www.sendspace.com/file/sqe9af]Testscape[/URL]

[URL=http://www.uppit.com/EB43J]Fr33sc4p3[/URL]

[URL=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=HAZSN579]Phonescape[/URL]

[URL=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=W8NCP0YC]Cheezescape 80[/URL]

Download one of the sources above. Open a folder where you want you&#39;re server to be and make a new folder and call it - Server
Using WinRar, extract it to the folder Server

5. Setting Up No-IP and Hamachi

Ok ill start off with hamachi, because im not explaining it. For hamachi go to:
[URL=http://www.portforward.com]Portforwarding[/URL] and follow the steps

[u]No-Ip[/u]

First of all you will need to go to [url=http://www.no-ip.com]www.no-ip.com[/url]

Now register an account.

Ok now go to the home-page and the top you should see downloads.
Click on it. It should look like this:

[IMG]http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/733/untitledip2.png[/img]

Now click on the tab &quot;Your No-IP&quot; and on the left navigation bar click Add
For the hostname put your server name, then choose what you want to 
be at the end: e.g. no-ip.info, no-ip.biz, servegame.com

YOU DO NOT NEED TO FILL IN ANYTHING ELSE! 
At the bottom click create host and you are done!

Well Done! You Can Now Host Your Server!

To host it, open no-ip and tick the box, and it should smile looking sorta like
this  :lol: 

Now, compile your server, then run it and it should say something like:

Starting Yourscape Server on 0.0.0.0 : 43594

NOW PEOPLE CAN LOG INTO YOUR SERVER w0000t!

Please post your comments!
Really i think i rushed this a bit
but here it is, any help just post 
here!

<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Chapter 1: How java works</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">In this chapter, you will learn the key vocabulary in Java, and how the most common things in java work, and how they are used. This will not dig very deep, it will just set you up so you can understand further chapters more easily.</span></p>
<p>In java, there are many confusing words that, well, confuse you. You may hear the terms, “class”, and “statement”, and “method”. Well, all of these words are some of the most commonly used terms in java, so you 'd better get used to them.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The class</span><br>
A class is a file that you create that can be run and compiled by the compiler. Usually a .java file is called a class, but one java file can contain many classes; but when you do that, things get complicated, so I will not go over this. A good thing that you may recognize is the client class (client.java), they are compiled from .java to .class files, because you cannot read the version of java that your computer runs. The compiler is a wonderful thing. It checks for errors in your java code, and makes java easier to program for you.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The method</span><br>
A method is a section of coding within a class that can be called upon with statements and other methods. Sounds confusing? By the end of this tutorial, you will understand. A method is basically a chunk of coding, that you can just put anywhere, and use repetitively by, “calling,” it. I will dig deeper into what calling is later in this tutorial.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The Statement</span><br>
Ah, the good old statement. A statement is usually a small chunk of code that can be placed within methods and classes. Statements usually call upon other methods to make their job easier. You can use multiple statements that call the same method. This is why java is so great. To do the job of many statements, you only need one method. A statement is usually used as a conditional, or: if this, then do this.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Chapter 2: Working with statements</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">In this chapter, you will learn how to make your own statements, and you will learn how they work.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">About the statement</span><br>
The statement is a line, or several lines of coding, that are most of the time used as conditionals (if, then). A statement can be used to call other methods, such as commands.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The “if” statement.</span><br>
An if statement is a statement that is strictly conditional. Here is the basic layout for it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(this) (then)</code></pre>
<p>The this is the conditional, and the then is what to do. Usually, in private server coding, the then part is used with braces, heres what it looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(this)
{
do stuff in here
}</code></pre>
<p>Those braces allow several methods to be used at once. Other statements that only use one method look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(this) then;</code></pre>
<p>Here is the command, a common use in private servers.</p>
<p><code>if(command.equalsIgnoreCase("commandhere"))
{
do stuff in here
}
</code><br>
Some “do stuff in here” things can be teleports, messages, adding of items, etc.<br>
The way of teleporting in private servers is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">teleportToX = xcoord;
teleportToY = ycoord;</code></pre>
<p>Where xcoord and ycoord are the coordinates that teleport you. You must put a ; at the end of it to show the end of the part of the statement.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The while statement</span><br>
The while statement is a statement that is used as a loop, there are other ones, but while is the best in my opinion.<br>
The while statement is used exactly as the if statement, but it is reused every 500 milliseconds.<br>
Here is the way it ususally goes:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">while(this)
{
do this
}</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Ways to use conditions within statements</span><br>
Ways to make conditions within statements like this:<br>
== means is equal to (within the computers memory)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>= means is greater than or equal to.<br>
&lt;= means is less than or equal to.<br>
.equals means that the actual things being used are identical<br>
&lt; means less than.<br>
means greater than.<br>
It will appear like this:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(this &gt; this)
{
do this
}</code></pre>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Chapter 3: Working with methods</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">In this chapter, you will learn how to create your own method, and call it within a statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The method</span><br>
The method is a chunk of code that can be used over and over again within statements. The most common method is the void, which is a method with no return type. To make sure you can use the void within statements and other methods, you must first use the word, “public”. A common method, the void, goes as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void name() 
{
all of your coding goes in here
}</code></pre>
<p>A void can contain statements inside of them. The () part is the parameters, which goes on into much more experienced coding, and I will not go into that in this tutorial. Maybe in future tutorials. Now inside your void, you can put in place all of the coding you want, and if you want to use that coding within a statement, or another void, you would use it as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">name();</code></pre>
<p>Thats all it takes to call your entire void. A void may be any size in length, its only limit is your skill and imagination. If you were to call a void inside a statement, it would appear as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(this)
{
name();
}</code></pre>
<p>This represents the conditional, and name represents the name of the void called.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Chapter 4: Using integers, and booleans</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">In this chapter, you will learn how to use integers, and booleans. You will learn their purpouse, and how they can help you.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Overview</span><br>
Integers and booleans are the most commonly used ways of storing data types in private servers. The integer will store a whole number within your computers memory, and the boolean will store a true or false statement within your computers memory.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The integer</span><br>
The integer is used to store a number in your computers memory, that can be used to define, or check if things are a certain number or not. To use an integer, you must first declare it with a name, and its value.<br>
Declaring an integer goes as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int name = value;</code></pre>
<p>You must declare your integer not within a method or statement, but anywhere else in a class to make it available to all methods and statements.<br>
We use public to make it available by other methods, and int to declare its type. Name is the name of it, and value is the initial value before it is changed.<br>
The most common thing you may see is playerRights, in which case 0 is a normal player, 1 is a moderator, and 2 is an admin.<br>
Using an integer in a statement goes as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(name == value)
{
name2 = value;
}</code></pre>
<p>Where name is your integer, and the value is checked by the if statement. name2 is the name of a different integer, in which you can change. The if statement will only work if the “name” integer is the correct value specified. Here is it more in detail, where name is used as human, and alien is used as name2.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(human == 1)
{
alien = 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>A boolean can better represent this. Which is why we are going on to booleans now.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The Boolean</span><br>
A boolean is used almost the same as an integer, but instead of numbers you would use true, or false.<br>
Like an integer, you must declare your boolean:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public boolean name = value;</code></pre>
<p>Where this time, value is set to either true, or false by default.<br>
Name is the name of your boolean, (like human, or alien).<br>
A boolean can be used in a statement as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(human)
{
alien = false;
}</code></pre>
<p>You don’t have to put an == true for a boolean that is true, but you do have to put an == false for a boolean that is false.<br>
Like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(human == false)
{
alien = true;
}</code></pre>
<p>The first statement will make it so if they are a human, then they are not an alien. The second one will mean if they are not a human, then they are an alien. You must first tell the server what a human and alien is within a method, otherwise it will have no effect.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Chapter 5: Working with classes</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">In this chapter you will learn how classes work, and how they relate, and how classes make java a unique programming language.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Making Classes</span><br>
Classes are usually single java files, but you can declare many classes within one java file; although I recommend you don’t. To make a class, you must first create a java file, named name.java. Name is the name of your new class. A class must have a main method in it.<br>
Now when you edit it, you must declare the class like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class name {
public void main() {
}
}</code></pre>
<p>Public makes it usable by other classes, and name is the name of your class.<br>
Inside the braces is where you would put your methods, statements, integers, booleans, and anything else that is considered java coding.<br>
Now, if you wanted to make a class so you dont have to code in your client class anymore, but you still want all the methods inside your client class, you would make what we call a subclass, or, a child class.<br>
Basically, all you would need to adopt all of the methods, statements, integers, and booleans is to put extends, and then the parent class. As follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class child extends parent
{
}</code></pre>
<p>Child is the name of your class, so put that there. And parent is the name of the class in which you wish to use all of its methods.<br>
In the child class, you can create a new statement, or method, identical to the one of the parent class, and override it by placing different code.<br>
To get a new class to work within a private server, you have to make it visible by the server class. I will not go into much detail about objects, but you need to know this to get it to work.<br>
To make the server class recognize it, and make it work while it runs, you must paste these two things with the same group in which the other classes are called:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">name = new name();</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public static name reference = null;</code></pre>
<p>Reference is used in more experienced coding, and you should just keep reference the same as your class name.<br>
name in both of these examples above is the name of your class.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Chapter 6: Common methods in private servers.</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">In this chapter you will learn the most common methods in private servers, and what they do.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">sendMessage</span><br>
This method will send a message to people in the text box, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sendMessage("message");</code></pre>
<p>it is used like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sendMessage("Hello");</code></pre>
<p>The word Hello will be sent to the player in their chat box.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">addItem</span><br>
This method is used to add an item, or a few, to a players inventory. It will only add a few of items if they are stackable, or noted.<br>
It looks like this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">addItem(ID, number);</code></pre>
<p>ID represents the item ID, which can be found in your item.cfg, and number is the amount of it.<br>
Here is how it can be used:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">addItem(995, 100000);</code></pre>
<p>If I am correct, 995 is the money item, and that will give them 100000 coins.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The Command</span><br>
This is used in an if statement.<br>
It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(command.operator("command"))
{
do this
}</code></pre>
<p>operator is usually equalsIgnoreCase, but it can be startsWith, and just equals.<br>
Here is what a command can look like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(command.equalsIgnoreCase("money") {
addItem(995, 1000000);
}</code></pre>
<p>Yet again, if I am correct, and 995 is the money item (I’m not sure), then that will give them 1M in money.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Chapter 7: Making NPCs</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">In this chapter, you will learn how to spawn NPCs.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Spawning</span><br>
So you want to make NPCs eh? Well, you’re at the right chapter. NPCs would be tedious, and incredibly hard to make if the makers of private servers did not use CFG files to spawn NPCs. Spawning NPCs requires a restart, but not a compile, because the server loads the NPCs every time it runs. Open your autospawn.cfg file, and look at it. You should see something around the likes of this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 580	2950	3387	0	2952	3390	2948	3385	1	Falador Mace Shop</code></pre>
<p>There are little squares in that code, because this website cannot show tabs. Anyways, spawning NPCs goes like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = ID(tab)xcoord(tab)ycoord(tab)height(tab)x1(tab)y1(tab)x2(tab)y2(tab)walktype(tab)description</code></pre>
<p>ID is the NPC id, x coordinate and y coordinate is where they originally spawn, the x1, x2, y1, y2 are coordinates in which they walk. I haven’t experimented around with walking ranges, so you’re going to have to figure it out yourself. The walktype should always remain 1, and the description is to help you know what it is, and it does not effect the coding of the NPC.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">A class with a method and statement</span></span><br>
To show you how classes, methods, and statements relate, I will show you a class that has a method that has a statement.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class givememoney extends client {
public void main() {
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase("money"))
{
addItem(995, 1000000);
}
}
}</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Private Server Information.</span></span></p>
<p>[<em>]They all crash, this means, they will crash while they are running, and they will require a restart, this cannot be helped.<br>
[</em>]They don’t have the most current runescape graphics, they won’t ever be so good.<br>
[<em>]None of them are complete, some magic doesnt work, and most sources are different, it takes years to get it perfect.<br>
[</em>]All sources are based off a few beginning servers, and have been upgraded upon and released.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Client.java</span><br>
Client.java is where you can basically control your source.<br>
Most of the stuff goes there.<br>
So for example if your source’s name is z0pszscape then click CTRL+F in your client.java and search for z0pszscape and change the name to whatever you like and keep searching till you can’t find a z0pszscape.<br>
So if you log on, the server’s name will be the name you chose.<br>
Ill teach you some basics of adding a command.</p>
<p><code>if (command.startsWith("food1"))
			{
		addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
                addItem(391,1);
			}</code><br>
Well this is easy just change the food1 which is the command name and change the 391  to what you want the item to be.And the 1 after the 391 for the amount of the item you want.<br>
To find item ID’s download the moparscape client and click “help” then you will see item ID’s, click that and then you will see a big list of item ID’s.</p>
<p>So client.java is mostly made of public and private voids and int’s ect…<br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Autospawn.cfg</span></span></p>
<p><code>//------NpcID---CoordX--CoordY--Height--RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2-WalkType-Descrption
spawn = 1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	TestNpcSpawn</code><br>
Autospawn.cfg is used like.</p>
<ol>
<li>Here u type what ID your NPC you want to add in your server.</li>
<li>Type in what the cordination X u want.</li>
<li>Type in what the cordination Y u want.</li>
<li>Here u type the hight of your NPC, most normal it is 0 u type here…</li>
<li>Here u can type what the MAX ranged X1 the NPC can walk</li>
<li>Here u can type what the MAX ranged Y1 the NPC can walk</li>
<li>Here u can type what the MAX ranged X2 the NPC can walk</li>
<li>Here u can type what the MAX ranged Y2 the NPC can walk</li>
<li>Type the name of the NPC u want…</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">How a object can teleport you with restrictions to use the object.</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">First Step:</span>Search for in client.java <code>/*OBJECT CLICK ONE*/</code><br>
You should see something like below.</p>
<p><code>case 2213: //Bank Booth
break;</code><br>
Paste this after the break; in one of the tele cases.</p>
<p><code>case 1234:  // Teleportation Name
teleportToX = 1234;
teleportToY = 1234;
break;</code><br>
Ok now change “case 1234:” (The 1234 to the Object ID you want, to teleport you.)<br>
Change the other “1234” to the coords you want the object to teleport you to<br>
And change the “Teleportation Name” to the name of the teleport.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Second Step:</span><br>
Ok this is the restrictions part.<br>
How about you wanted the person to have 20 attack before they can use the object to teleport you?<br>
Well then the case should look like this.</p>
<p><code> case 0000:
    if(playerLevel[1] &gt;= 20) {
    sendMessage("You use the object.");
    teleportToX = 0000;
    teleportToY = 0000;
	}
    } else {
    sendMessage("You need 20 attack to use this object")
    break;</code><br>
Now just change the “20” to how much you want the person to have the skill level to use the object.<br>
And change the “sendMessage” to what you want the message to be.</p>
<p>How about you wanted it to be admin only? or mod?<br>
It’s the same thing.</p>
<p><code> case 0000:
    if(playerRights &gt;= 2) {
    sendMessage("You use the admin only object.");
    teleportToX = 0000;
    teleportToY = 0000;
	}
    } else {
    sendMessage("Admin ONLY.")
    break;</code><br>
Now change the “2” in the playerRights in the case to the right you want the person to have to use the object.And Once again change the “sendMessage”</p>

<ol>
<li>Requirements</li>
</ol>
<p>To get your server working you comply to the following requirements:</p>
<p>256 MB Ram<br>
Java Installed - Read Step 2<br>
A Working Client<br>
A Source</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Installing Java</li>
</ol>
<p>The latest version of Java is JDK 6u1<br>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Download JDK 6u1</a></p>
<p>When you click on the link this page will load up:<br>
<img src="http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/5779/javadownloadnz8.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Click on Download next to JDK 6u1</p>
<p>Click accept and it should refresh the page to look like this:<br>
<img src="http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/9615/javainstallxe8.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Tick the box then choose which way you want to download:<br>
Offline or Online Installation</p>
<p>Well Done! You have installed the latest version of java!</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Setting Environment Variables:<br>
To allow your computer to run the server you need to set your environment variables</li>
</ol>
<p>First open my computer, then right-click on my computer and click properties</p>
<p>Now click on advanced</p>
<p>This Is What It Should Look Like:<br>
<img src="http://img170.imageshack.us/img170/1814/enviromentvariableseo5.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Ok near the bottom it says Enviroment Variables</p>
<p>Click on that, and a new window looking like this should open:<br>
<img src="http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/9301/newenvvxu3.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Under [QUOTE]System Variables[/QUOTE] Click the New button and a new window opens up.</p>
<p>For the Variable Name Put: classpath<br>
For the value put: C:\Program Files\Java\Java\jdk1.6.0_01\bin\</p>
<p>Now click OK</p>
<p>Now look for a variable in System Variable called path. Highlighting, by clickin on it once, and click EDIT.</p>
<p>Rename it: PATH<br>
Replace the value with this: [QUOTE]%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\Sy stem32\Wbem;C:\Program Files\QuickTime\QTSystem;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_11\bin[/QUOTE]</p>
<p>Click OK then Ok again and that’s it<br>
[SIZE=7]<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
FOR THIS TO WORK PROPERLY YOU MUST RESTART YOUR COMPUTER</span>[/SIZE]</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Getting WinRar</li>
</ol>
<p>To start off with your private servers you will need Winrar. IT is the base to downloading nearly everything to do with private servers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.download.com/WinRAR/3000-2250_4-10614813.html?tag=lst-0-2" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">WinRar</a></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Download A Client<br>
To play private servers you need to have a client. Moparscape is the first, and basic client to use. I recommend that you use it, unless you want to use someone else’s.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://rs95.rapidshare.com/files/28641428/MoparScapeInstall.exe" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Download MoparScape 3.2 With Aryan</a></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Downloading A Source<br>
To make “YOUR” own private server you need a source to work it. Here are some common sources.<br>
<a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=16KZIJK5" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Pimpscape</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://rapidshare.de/files/32630302/Project16_V.6.rar.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Project 16 V 6</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/sqe9af" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Testscape</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.uppit.com/EB43J" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Fr33sc4p3</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=HAZSN579" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Phonescape</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=W8NCP0YC" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Cheezescape 80</a></p>
<p>Download one of the sources above. Open a folder where you want you’re server to be and make a new folder and call it - Server<br>
Using WinRar, extract it to the folder Server</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Setting Up No-IP and Hamachi</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok ill start off with hamachi, because im not explaining it. For hamachi go to:<br>
<a href="http://www.portforward.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Portforwarding</a> and follow the steps</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">No-Ip</span></p>
<p>First of all you will need to go to <a href="http://www.no-ip.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">www.no-ip.com</a></p>
<p>Now register an account.</p>
<p>Ok now go to the home-page and the top you should see downloads.<br>
Click on it. It should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/733/untitledip2.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Now click on the tab “Your No-IP” and on the left navigation bar click Add<br>
For the hostname put your server name, then choose what you want to<br>
be at the end: e.g. no-ip.info, no-ip.biz, <a href="http://servegame.com" rel="nofollow noopener">servegame.com</a></p>
<p>YOU DO NOT NEED TO FILL IN ANYTHING ELSE!<br>
At the bottom click create host and you are done!</p>
<p>Well Done! You Can Now Host Your Server!</p>
<p>To host it, open no-ip and tick the box, and it should smile looking sorta like<br>
this  :lol:</p>
<p>Now, compile your server, then run it and it should say something like:</p>
<p>Starting Yourscape Server on 0.0.0.0 : 43594</p>
<p>NOW PEOPLE CAN LOG INTO YOUR SERVER w0000t!</p>
<p>Please post your comments!<br>
Really i think i rushed this a bit<br>
but here it is, any help just post<br>
here!</p>
