    <description>hi, i have been trying to change my teleport to home for a while now. when you click &quot;home&quot; it goes to an interface in the chat box and has 4 options, one of them is the home and i want to change that one to where my new home is. ive been searching for ages but all of it just tells you how to change the normal teleports without that interface in the chatbox.. if someone could help me that would be great.. thanks.

and also, i have changed the ip in client.java (client sided) and my freinds cant connect to it.. it says error connecting to server :/</description>

<p>clickingbuttons.java for the teleport</p>
<p>or it may just need fixing in the config.java</p>
<p>error connecting means that you are not ported right or your server is not on.</p>

              <p>Have you change the IP of your friends aswell?<br>
If you have bought a VPS then your friends IP should be whatever the VPS’s IP is OR a NO-IP.<br>
If you are running a server from home, then make sure your NO-IP is turned on and their IP’s match your NO-IP’s.</p>
