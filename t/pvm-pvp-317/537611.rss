    <title>PvM / PVP 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pvm-pvp-317/537611</link>
    <description>Hello, I want to make a PvM and a PVP type of server that is 317. I know that you guys are thinking that it&#39;s just another boring 317 server but I want to make this one unique. I want to make a bossing system that no other server has seen before. I want to make the server fun instead of just training and getting rich. I just can&#39;t do it alone. I will most likely not release the server to the public (change of mind may come). I just want to do this for the experience.

I AM LOOKING FOR NEW PROGRAMMERS
I want to work together with people who are not experienced. It is fun because we&#39;ll be learning and that is watch the project is also about. Having one professional programmer watch us every once in awhile would be helpful though. I also have very little experience in Java so I still have a lot to learn. 

If you&#39;re interested in joining, you will have to follow these rules.
1. Agree on our decisions.
2. Stay active (I&#39;m not talking about weekdays, i&#39;m talking about weekends.)
3. Work together for at least an hour. 
4. Have fun, chill out, relax, and laugh. 

Application form:
Skype:
First Language:
Age:
Are you experienced in Java:

I will be taking about 2-4 programmers. Nothing has been decided yet (no source, name, etc). If you&#39;re a professional programmer and will be willing to take some time to watch over us, use the same application as above. 

Sorry if this post is also bad, I just joined the forums. :D</description>
