    <description>[QUOTE=Zak Wins]Raw Envy has binded a R.A.T into his cache.. I would take caution downloading. The R.A.T is called &#39;GamePack.jar&#39; in the cache. Here is some proof: [img]http://i.imgur.com/sAETNCB.png[/img][/QUOTE]

Explanation of a Remote Administration Tool (R.A.T)

[QUOTE=Wikipedia]Many trojans and backdoors now have remote administration capabilities allowing an individual to control the victim&#39;s computer. Many times, a file (often called a client or stub) must be opened on the victim&#39;s computer before the hacker can have access to it. These are generally sent through email, P2P file sharing software, and in internet downloads. They are usually disguised as a legitimate program or file. Many clients/stubs will display a fake error message when opened, to make it seem like it didn&#39;t open. Some will also disable antivirus and firewall software. RAT trojans can generally do the following:


[ul][*]Block mouse and keyboard
[*]Change the desktop wallpaper
[*]Download, upload, delete, and rename files
[*]Destroy hardware by overclocking
[*]Drop viruses and worms
[*]Edit Registry
[*]Use your internet to perform denial of service attacks (DoS)
[*]Format drives
[*]Steal passwords, credit card numbers
[*]Alter your webbrowsers homepage
[*]Hide desktop icons, taskbar and files
[*]Silently install applications
[*]Log keystrokes, keystroke capture software
[*]Open CD-ROM tray
[*]Overload the RAM/ROM drive
[*]Send messageboxes
[*]Play sounds
[*]Control mouse or keyboard
[*]Record sound with a connected microphone
[*]Record video with a connected webcam
[*]Show fake errors
[*]Shutdown, restart, log-off, shut down monitor
[*]Record and control victim&#39;s screen remotely
[*]View, kill, and start tasks in task manager
[*]A well-designed RAT will allow the operator the ability to do anything that they could do with physical access to the machine. Some RAT [*]trojans are pranks that are most likely being controlled by a friend or enemy on April Fool&#39;s Day or a holiday. Prank RATs are generally not harmhful, and won&#39;t log keystrokes or store information about the system on the computer. They usually do disruptive things like flip the screen [*]upside-down, open the CD-ROM tray, or swap mouse buttons.[/ul]

Full details here - [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_administration_software]Remote administration software - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/url]

Removing the RAT:

First off we&#39;re going to search for MSCONFIG if you&#39;re using Windows XP, Vista or 7 and click the start-up tab and disable any unknown applications from starting on start-up, windows 8/8.1/10 user&#39;s will have to open the Task Manager and click Start-Up tab and again look for any unknown applications on start-up.

Next, we&#39;re going to delete visionarystorage located in user.home now supposedly this is hidden as a Javaw process, so we&#39;re going to kill/terminate all Javaw processes through Task Manager.

*[B][I]NOTE[/I][/B]: Make sure you have no RSPS Client open or Chrome/Firefox that may have things like RuneScape or Java based games running on them as this will end the process.

We&#39;re going to run a scan, using any of these following programs (these are what I personally use on various computers).

AVG - free.avg.com - general anti-virus software, serves an all round purpose however, does not do the job aswell as the two below.
 
Spybot Search &amp; Destroy - [url=http://www.safer-networking.org/dl/]Download | Spybot ©[/url] (stops and notifies you of Registry changes/any &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;malicious&quot; activity or changes, searches for rootkits, adware, spyware and malware

Malwarebytes - [url=https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/]https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/[/url] - searches for Adware, Spyware &amp; Malware

after your selected choice(s) of software has been installed, we&#39;re going to restart your computer into safe mode, details can be found here - [url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7]Starting your computer in safe mode - Windows Help[/url] (should work with 8/8.1 &amp; 10).

Run a secure scan, to be cautious in full detail, you could restore you computer to before December or [B][I]alternatively[/I][/B], back-up all import document, photos, videos &amp; music to the OneDrive or something similar and re-install windows, Windows 10 comes with a feature to fresh install from inside the OS it&#39;s self.

Yes, there&#39;s more advanced ways to make sure your computer is secure, but this is just a basic tutorial for those whom are worried they maybe infected.</description>

<p>It doesn’t <em>look</em> like it does on an initial inspection, gamepack.jar does not use that class at all, the launcher does to load gamepack.jar from the filesystem after it is downloaded.  Of course it could do it with obfuscated strings and reflection, but if it did malicious things with that on load I would have caught it with wireshark/defender/malwarebytes.</p>
<p>All I can really say with regard to the safety is at the moment I tested everything it didn’t do anything malicious to my computer.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:4, topic:549223”]I downloaded the gamepack.jar applet, and the Launcher.jar launcher.  The launcher simply does this:</p>
<p><code>wget -U 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1667.0 Safari/537.36' 'http://www.visionary317.com/aperto/Gamepack.Download.php?aperto_version=3' -O gamepackphp.jar
</code><br>
And runs the jar, it is the same as the gamepack.jar applet which is good.</p>
<p>I decompiled all of them and searched for anything it downloads, it <em>looks</em> like it just downloads the cache, from here: <code>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/34773511/Visionary_Storage.zip</code></p>
<p>None of these files contain any native binaries like .exe, .dll or anything that wouldn’t legitimately be found in a runescape cache or java jar file.  I uploaded all 3 files to virustotal and they were all clean.</p>
<p>Next I fired up windows 8.1 in virtualbox, installed firefox, java 8, and wireshark.  I recorded in wireshark and ran the applet, and also later the launcher.  I tried to log in to play but it said the login server was down.  As far as I can tell the only thing either one downloaded was the cache, which it extracted it my user directory.  I also checked for background processes before and after running them and didn’t see any new ones, and none named javaw.exe like the original post said.</p>
<p>I also updated and ran a full windows defender scan which found nothing, then I installed malwarebytes, updated the definitions, then rebooted in safe mode and run a full malwarebytes scan which also turned up clean.</p>
<p>So as far as I can tell, at the moment I tested all of this stuff it is clean.  It’s possible it waits to do bad things, or the bad things don’t work on Java 8 or Firefox or Windows 8.1 or something like that as well, so I can’t say it’s 100% clean, but I couldn’t find anything wrong with it so I guess I won’t remove it from the server status page for now.[/quote]<br>

<p>First off we’re going to search for MSCONFIG if you’re using Windows XP, Vista or 7 and click the start-up tab and disable any unknown applications from starting on start-up, windows 8/8.1/10 user’s will have to open the Task Manager and click Start-Up tab and again look for any unknown applications on start-up.</p>
<p>Next, we’re going to delete visionarystorage located in user.home now supposedly this is hidden as a Javaw process, so we’re going to kill/terminate all Javaw processes through Task Manager.</p>
<p>*[B][I]NOTE[/I][/B]: Make sure you have no RSPS Client open or Chrome/Firefox that may have things like RuneScape or Java based games running on them as this will end the process.</p>
<p>We’re going to run a scan, using any of these following programs (these are what I personally use on various computers).</p>
<p>AVG - <a href="http://free.avg.com" rel="nofollow noopener">free.avg.com</a> - general anti-virus software, serves an all round purpose however, does not do the job aswell as the two below.</p>
<p>Spybot Search &amp; Destroy - <a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/dl/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Download | Spybot ©</a> (stops and notifies you of Registry changes/any “odd” or “malicious” activity or changes, searches for rootkits, adware, spyware and malware</p>
<p>Malwarebytes - <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/</a> - searches for Adware, Spyware &amp; Malware</p>
<p>after your selected choice(s) of software has been installed, we’re going to restart your computer into safe mode, details can be found here - <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Starting your computer in safe mode - Windows Help</a> (should work with 8/8.1 &amp; 10).</p>
<p>Run a secure scan, to be cautious in full detail, you could restore you computer to before December or [B][I]alternatively[/I][/B], back-up all import document, photos, videos &amp; music to the OneDrive or something similar and re-install windows, Windows 10 comes with a feature to fresh install from inside the OS it’s self.</p>
<p>Yes, there’s more advanced ways to make sure your computer is secure, but this is just a basic tutorial for those whom are worried they maybe infected.</p>
