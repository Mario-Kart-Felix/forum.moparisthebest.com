    <description>People like blakeman8192, b00mer, graham, taharok, where did they get their programming knowledge from? Say I wanted to build a server base, I wouldn&#39;t even know where to begin. How did they actually copy RuneScape back in 317/474 or even now, are there books that&#39;ll teach me the 3d rendering and multiplayer networking? Or am I going to have to wait and take courses at uni.</description>

</aside>
<p>The obvious conclusion to come to is that in order to progress in any field of study, you definitely have to learn.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>: I suggest that you do not start with any ‘big’ project if you are trying to learn something, because you will often end up confused and frustrated. This applies to private server emulation; if you don’t understand any part of the language associated with the content, you will not know how to solve the problem at hand. A lot of people will beg to differ, because many members of this community were introduced into the programming field via rs2 emulation, and it is very possible to learn Java from only working with a private server.</p>
<p>Please understand that this post is extremely opinionated by myself, and the learning process for everyone is different based upon your individual experiences with problem solving in general. I may have lost you by now, but if I still have you attention, let me just say that I prefer not to break down something big, making it simpler, but building from the ground up, and keeping it as simple as possible. Simplicity is key, and has turned out to be the best way to learn something (at least for me).</p>

</aside>
<p>Well that’s how I was introduced to programming. I didn’t understand much but if-statement and ctrl+f was enough. Obviously I have to learn, but where? There aren’t any books or guides on how to make my own Hyperion or Apollo. Do I need to find books on model rendering? Or how multiplayer networks work? Shit I don’t even know what I need to know.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you are working on a private server, it shouldn’t be necessary for you to learn model rendering, although learning about networking could be beneficial, I’m not quite sure you would even touch on it too much. The thing you have to realize is that learning Java and working on a game in Java are two completely different things. You will need to study the protocol of the emulation you are using, but you will need to have a grasp on Java in order to do so.[/quote]</p>
<p>Seems like if I knew enough Java, I’d just have to do is spend enough time with private servers to do the same types of things influential programmers here did. Hmm, I was under the impression sources like Hyperion <span class="bbcode-i">were</span> the emulation coded from the ground up.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>: I suggest that you do not start with any ‘big’ project if you are trying to learn something, because you will often end up confused and frustrated.

<p>Please understand that this post is extremely opinionated by myself, and the learning process for everyone is different based upon your individual experiences with problem solving in general. I may have lost you by now, but if I still have you attention, let me just say that I prefer not to break down something big, making it simpler, but building from the ground up, and keeping it as simple as possible.

<p>Well that’s how I was introduced to programming. I didn’t understand much but if-statement and ctrl+f was enough. Obviously I have to learn, but where? There aren’t any books or guides on how to make my own Hyperion or Apollo. Do I need to find books on model rendering? Or how multiplayer networks work? Shit I don’t even know what I need to know.[/quote]<br>
If you are working on a private server, it shouldn’t be necessary for you to learn model rendering, although learning about networking could be beneficial, I’m not quite sure you would even touch on it too much. The thing you have to realize is that learning Java and working on a game in Java are two completely different things. You will need to study the protocol of the emulation you are using, but you will need to have a grasp on Java in order to do so.</p>

<p>At the time, we thought it was so difficult to do so, but in the end, it was easy. Same thing now.</p>
<p>We don’t remember that feeling when we were trying to read for the first time because we didn’t have much of a brain. Now that we have a brain, we see things as ‘hard’, but in reality, its just as hard as it way to learn how to read and write.</p>

              <p>People like blakeman8192, b00mer, graham, taharok, where did they get their programming knowledge from? Say I wanted to build a server base, I wouldn’t even know where to begin. How did they actually copy RuneScape back in 317/474 or even now, are there books that’ll teach me the 3d rendering and multiplayer networking? Or am I going to have to wait and take courses at uni.</p>
