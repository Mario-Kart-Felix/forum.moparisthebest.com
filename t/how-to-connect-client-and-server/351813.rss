    <title>How to connect client and server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-connect-client-and-server/351813</link>
    <description>Now , i got all my server done and stuff. But how do i connect my client and server ? I mean if i upload my client to the internet , a person downloads it , then when he runs the client and logs in he is in my server ?

That problem now solved. But now ,  i take no - ip duc , choose tools , and there open port check tools.

I do the test , and it says : 
Error: I could not see your service on xxx.xxx.xx.xx on port (43594)
Reason: Connection refused

That was when the server source server wasnt running , when its running then :
Error: I could not see your service on xxx.xxx.xx.xx on port (43594)
Reason: Connection timed out</description>
