    <description>hello im demonwars.

ive bin working on webclients for my server.

the webclient does not work and stops working at allocated memory.

ive done this:

MANIFEST:
[code]Main-Class: client
Class-Path: lib\hdlibs.jar[/code]

And the jar does not work on its self.
the bat says this:
[code]THIS BATCH IS FOR DEBUGGING THE EXECUTABLE JAR ONLY
DOUBLE-CLICK THE &quot;DemonWars.jar&quot; TO RUN IT
-
Generated by: JAR Maker (http://www.goldenstudios.or.id/)

[code]&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;My Applet Page&lt;/title&gt;

              <p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:2, topic:421248”]First off, the 508 LD client wasn’t resizable (as far as I know). Good luck modifying it to be so.</p>
<p>Secondly, with a webclient, you can’t have a dynamic resizable client (not counting just inputting x-y on start up, without some serious modification; and anyone willing to do this would probably not do so for free)</p>
<p>So that leaves a normal 508 LD fixed client and a 508 HD client (which I suggest you just do something like width:100% or something similar to get it as large as you can)</p>
<hr>
<p>This is actually what I am doing with the team I am on right now, it’s fallen upon me to get it all working (as I’m sure you know, there haven’t been many successful 508 developments, we intend to fix that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</p>
<p>I’m not going to spoon feed you for a few reasons. First off, I like people to learn things themselves. Secondly it’s actually what I completed yesterday, and I’m not sure I want the code to be released quite yet ;D</p>
<p>Here’s a brief summary though:</p>
<p>First off, you need to make sure the user has the cache. In a download-able client this is no issue. They can just download the cache inside the client download. However because of the nature of applets this is not reasonable – the applet would take ages to load and people would wonder what the hell was going on (and probably just abandon the page when it looks like nothing is happening) There are a few ways to handle this. One way is to put a cache downloader (downloads and extracts your cache archive – or one file at a time) inside the client. (Tip - Look around Signlink.java) This is preferable, as it means the user hardly has to do anything in order to play. There is also a way the client can download it directly from the server, but you wont be able to do that without some help from someone a tad more knowledgeable about the client than myself. It probably wouldn’t take too long to figure out, but I already had the cache downloader written so meh.</p>
<p>Secondly, the people that distributed the 508 clients modified the loading methods (which is where your error is) so that it created a JFrame instead of an applet. You need to re-create the init() method and remove the main method. <span class="bbcode-b">MAKE SURE YOU ASSIGN THE PROPER VALUES TO THE VARIABLES IN THIS METHOD AS WELL.</span> You can completely remove the need for those applet parameters if you statically set them in the method. When it calls a method to instantiate Applet_sub1 as well, the Signlink class it creates changes depending on the type of client (web or jframe) it expects to create. For example if you try to create an applet version, the way it loads the cache is going to be different. It’s hard to explain without spoonfeeding you the code, but that’s how it works. The hint for this part is [tt]client.java[/tt] and [tt]Applet_sub1.java[/tt]</p>
<p>Now you just need to jar it up (and in the case of the HD client, perhaps put the opengl libraries directly into the bin directory instead of loaded into the classpath) and sign it, and you’re ready to deploy!</p>
<p>I expect once my webclient is released it wont take long for someone to decompile it and just get it to work themselves (not that a webclient is too difficult anyway, but the 508 ones tend to be rare), so if you can wait you may not have to do anything really at all.[/quote]</p>
<p>how long have you bin on the forums?<br>
there is a 508 LD fullscreen/resizable client downloadeble.<br>
i already have it.<br>
its also custom sprite loading and all of that</p>
<p>EDIT: thanks for the explaination, but i go to friends everyday and i can only code in the evening and i have to keep the server up-to-date so ill just wait^^<br>
i use my 508 HD Custom Client, based on hotyute and thanks to noobs are ftw.<br>
its a completely different coding then the normal 508 HD and LD clients</p>
