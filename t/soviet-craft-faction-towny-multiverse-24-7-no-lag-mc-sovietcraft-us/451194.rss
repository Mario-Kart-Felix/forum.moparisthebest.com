    <description>[b]SovietCraft is a Survival/Faction based server with the players in mind. We’re always looking for prestigious players that set themselves apart from everyone else, we currently are accepting Staff Applications, and we’ll read them as they come in and when we have the time. 

What sets us apart from the other servers, is the fact that we put the players first. If a player needs help, we will help the player before we carry on with what we’re doing. We do not ignore players, and allow them to deal with their issues on their own. We listen to players, and are always accepting of new suggestions on how to better the server in any way! We strive for the player to experience the best of Minecraft on our server. We&#39;d love to see you online![/b]

Server Name: Soviet Craft
IP Address: mc.SovietCraft.us

Best of luck, and kindest regards,
