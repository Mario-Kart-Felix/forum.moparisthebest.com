    <description>i dunno, better make this non member tut for money.
then membs don&#39;t have probs lol.
---------------------------------------------------------------

go kill some cows, take the hides,
bank them and return, kill cows, take hides, bank them..(and on)
then goto world 1 and sell them 100 to 110 gp each, say:
&#39; sell hides 100 e &#39; or change the 100 to your price

go be a skiller and chop a lot of yews 
sell them for 200 to 250 each

go mine coal,
and afterwards sell to players who are buying
for 250 each.

lol, money making tips,
but probeble everybody would know already
but yeah, i&#39;ll don&#39;t say the dragon trick anymore  :rolleyes:
( i might do it, just becouse i&#39;m a pker myself? )</description>

<p>ok so you dont feel like spending your real hard earned 5$ to pay to play a internet game but you still want to money well thats ok because you have got this guide to guide you to riches.</p>
<p>METHOD 1, ok the first thing i recomend is to get your mineing up until you can mine gold, iron, or coal once u get your mining up then mine about 100 of gold, iron or coal and sell them to people in banks…but maybe you dont wanna sit in the bank all day saying selling 1000 coal _ _ _ea. well not to worry because i will buy it just go to <a href="http://www.rs2armor.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.rs2armor.com</a> and click “need a job?” then click apply then fill the form out correctly and within 24 hrs you will get a responce.</p>
<p>METHOD 2, ok say you dont wanna spend all that time mining all those ores well not to worry because thats not the only way to make money the next step to riches is to go to falladores gate (the one as your coming from drayner village) and kill highway men they have a 100% drop rate of droppping a cape… this mean they will drop a cape EVERY time you kill one, after you kill about 10 of them and you have 10 capes go to “aggie” (the witch in drayner village) and turn the capes into different colors (you will need certian ingredients for every color per cape)(aggie will tell you those ingredients)…after you dye all 10 capes go to varock or falladore bank and sell them from 100-1500 gp (gp=gold points…aka…gold)</p>
<p>METHOD 3, another way to make money as a non-member is to go to the crafting guild and kill cows take there hides and go to the falladore bank and bank all of them do this until you have about 100 or more of them then go to varock, al kharid, or falladore bank and SELL THEM FOR 100 GP EA</p>
<p>METHOD 4, one of the most profitable way to make money is to mine and smith this is a very good way once your able to mine and smith mithril or higher…heres what you do.,.,.,</p>
<p>1.get your mining to 55<br>
2.get your smithing to 50<br>
3.mine 20 mithril ore<br>
4.mine the nessecary coal to make mith ore into bars<br>
5.make the ore into bars<br>
6.smith the bars into the best thing you can make with mithril<br>
EX: say i have 50 smithing so i would make 20 mithril daggers but say i am able to make mithril platebodys then im going to make 4 mithil platebodys or attempt to make FULL mithril depending on the amount of bars i have</p>
<p>well thats mostly covers the GOOD ways to make money as a non-member…but  remember these are not the only ways there are several ways to make money these are the best 4.</p>
<p>Page 5</p>
<p>~^v^~Making Money As A Member~^v^~</p>
<p>There are ALOT of ways to make money as a member to many to write about so Iâ€™m going to write about the methods Iâ€™ve used.</p>
<p>METHOD 1, ok if youâ€™re like me and you hate working to get money then this method is for youâ€™re the only problem is for this money you need<br>
1 million gp+ or this method wont work very well… ok to start you must go seers village to get there you can walk or teleport to Catherby which is right next to seers village once you get there go to the bank and withdraw 1m gp or more then type the following “buy bs 150 ea” or “buying noted bs 150 ea” bs are bow strings.,., once you have run out of money then open up a new window and go to runescape and click on “discuss the game on the forums” then you will be directed to a new page on the top right of the page you will see “log in” click that and log in once you get there your will be directed to the page you where on at first once your there scroll down until you find “fletching” click on there then on the top click “make new topic” make one and as topic put “selling bs 180ea” the in the body part of the message put as follows</p>
<p>"<br>
Selling bowstrings<br>
Price: 180 each<br>
Place: seersâ€™ village<br>
World: (the world youâ€™re in)<br>
BS left: (put here how many BS you have left)</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Then wait for buyers the usually come pretty quick below is a list of how many bowstrings you should end up with per million you spend</p>
<p>M = Million</p>
<p>1M ------  6,667<br>
2M ------- 13,333<br>
3M ------   20,000<br>
4M ------   26,666<br>
5M ------   33,333</p>
<p>ECT…ECT</p>
<p>METHOD 2, the next way to make money is to fletch arrows this is great because arrows are at such a high demand when there in bulk (1k or more)â€¦ this is what you doâ€¦go and cut down 100 normal logs then get the ore of what kind of arrows you want to make (bronze addy mith rune steelâ€¦) then use the bar of what kind or ore your using (mith ironâ€¦) and use it with an anvil and make arrows heads(NOTE you need a certain fletching lvl for each arrow)</p>
<p>METHOD 3, another good way to make money is to kill dragons either baby dragons or normal ones (baby blue dragons are lvl 48 other drags can be from 111-276) killing these dragons and selling there bones is a great way to make money dragon bones (not baby dragon bones) sell for up to 2.8k each!! Sell these on the forums under miscellanies.</p>
<p>METHOD 4, another way to make money and my favorite is to make a â€œpureâ€ which is a low lvl account with a high skill such as an lvl 3 with 60 mage this can be done by not actually doing spells but enchanting at the mage arena in   al-karid do this until your lvl 3 with very high magic I suggest 55 or more then go and train your defense until you get to   15-20 def. then go into the duel arena and risk money I recommend 10k-100k depending on how good you are I recommend not fighting ANYBODY 20 lvls over you.</p>
<p>METHOD 5, thieving is another good way to make money first go to a place with lvl 3 men and pickpocket them until your thieving is lvl 5 then go to varock and steal from the tea stall until your lvl 20 thieving then go to west ardougne and there you will find  silk stall steal from there until your lvl 40 then go to varock and pickpocket guards do this until your lvl 47 then go to relleka (must have done fremnick trials) once there go find a chest and you will fins one eventually that says search for traps then search it and you will get stuff do this until 72 then go to ardougne and steal from the chest there and get the sharks bank them and repeat until your lvl 75 thieving then steal from the gem stall and or chest that you get sharks (72)</p>
<p>WARNING: OCCASIONLY BUT NOT OFTEN YOU WILL FAIL TO SERACH THE CHEST AND YOUâ€™LL GET POISEND SO BRING ANTIPOISION AND ONLY 3 ITEMS AND WHEN YOU STEAL FROM CHEST AND GET CAUGHT A GUARD WILL ATTACK YOU THE HIGHER LVL THIEVING STALL YOUR STEALING FROM THE HIGHER LVL GUARD THAT WILL ATTACK YOU</p>
<p>METHOD 6, ok for this method to work you need the following</p>
<p>45+ woodcutting<br>
10+ crafting<br>
55+ fletching<br>
44+ runecrafting<br>
55+ magic</p>
<p>if you donâ€™t have 44+ runecrafting then you can just buy the runes needed</p>
<p>ok this is how it works (buying will not make you any profit in this but you will lose money) start out by cutting 100 maple logs then use a knife and turn them into maple longbows (u) then  collect 100 flax and turn them into BS then use you BS with your maple longbow (u) â€˜s then craft 100 nature runes then get a fire staff and high alc all 100 of your now maple longbows then REPEAT.</p>
