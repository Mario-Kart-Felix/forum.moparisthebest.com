              <p>Don’t know if people know as this doesn’t look like this was updated, but we’ve moved up to 562. Using an empty 562 Source File, I think we might create a new page, or not… I’m not so sure… Current Developers are:</p>
<p>~~ Server Development ~~</p>
<p>-&gt; Makka<br>
-&gt; Connor<br>
-&gt; Me (wall-e)</p>
<p>~~ Web Development Team ~~</p>
<p>-&gt; Steven<br>
-&gt; Me (wall-e)</p>
<p>I believe spots are available too help on this, as we’re not really gonna give up on this project… just a few things I’d like to post though before people call our other source a leech / etc.</p>
<p>This is not “based” or a “base source” of Noszscape, Emberscape, or RuneSlay. We are using the most basic 562 that we could find, and working with it. So far, these are some of our updates… but as I said we might make a new Dev Page.</p>
<h1>=================================================================<br>
Update Log</h1>
<pre><code>[Makka - 18/6/11]
</code></pre>
<p>6:40am ~ Downloaded Runesource 562… Then added:</p>
<p>-&gt; Falador Home<br>
-&gt; Wiped shops &amp; shop handler (ready for re-write)<br>
-&gt; Fixed some shop glitchs. (buy one item and get a diffrent one)<br>
-&gt; Cleaned CommandsPacketHandler.java<br>
-&gt; Began adding ‘members only’ features (donator)<br>
-&gt; Fixed clipping from yaks to the water…<br>
-&gt; Added a new starter<br>
-&gt; Began adding ancients/lunar altars.<br>
-&gt; Added 25+ Npcs.<br>
-&gt; Made banker (ID - 494) bring bank interface on single click. (without clip glitch)<br>
-&gt; Added ‘tabbed banking’ also changed ‘bank of Runescape’ to ‘Bank of Microfire.’<br>
-&gt; New training area (White knights) found the correct annimations.<br>
-&gt; Added Jad, In real area. I’ll work on the waves at a later stage.<br>
-&gt; Just finished adding 1 click pvp!<br>
-&gt; Added Some shitty Runecrafting staff (dont know the correct name).<br>
-&gt; We now have Hand cannon special attack. <em>GASP</em><br>
-&gt; Added Overloads. (Still need fixing, But give 125 attack, str ect.)<br>
-&gt; Added voting hats ;O.<br>
-&gt; Fixed Personal Message glitch (player cant get a crown any more :))<br>
-&gt; Added Quick chat. EDIT: were like the 3rd 562 with quick chat?!<br>
-&gt; Added working following; Needs alot more work doing -__-<br>
-&gt; Added guilded altar for members, also you need a prayer level of 50 to use.<br>
-&gt; Fixed ‘Members’ Rank.<br>
-&gt; Began wrighting the new shops.</p>
<p>1am ~ Stopped coding. 19-20 hours of straight coding… Nice.</p>
<p>[Makka 19/6/11]<br>
9:30am - Got my lazzyyyy arse out of bed and began;</p>
<p>-&gt; Changed a few prices for items. (e.g rune plate was 0gp.).<br>
-&gt; Started writting new npc dialouges. (Mind my spelling &gt;.&lt;)<br>
-&gt; Added Economic range shop &amp; Armor shop &amp; Supplies shop &amp; Food shop :).</p>
<p>[Makka &amp; Connor 19/6/11]<br>
1:19pm - Began;</p>
<p>-&gt; Cleaned Npcs.Xml, Recieved 3 errors But fixed them.<br>
-&gt; Added pots to Food shop<br>
-&gt; Changed White Knights in NpcDefinition.XML.<br>
-&gt; Added wall-e too the Dev Team <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>[Wall-e 19/6/11]<br>
2:06pm - Started on some casual shit.</p>
<p>-&gt; Added Duel Arena mini-game with Makka.<br>
-&gt; Fixed up Trade Screenehz.<br>
-&gt; Working on Quick-Chat too appear for other players, along with the proper image. :p.<br>
-&gt; Added basic Soulwars base, and zeal rewards.<br>
-&gt; Started on Castle Wars.<br>
-&gt; Got the Quest Log working, clicking on the Quest Name now opens the correct interface, as well as 1 simple quest for test. ;]. (rhymer bish).<br>
-&gt; Working on Clipped-Following, Makka started on following but we removed for now, as we want to release this for play ASAP.<br>
-&gt; Made it so people don’t have to do a “command” to duel other players, you can now “Request” a duel, as well as staking and friendly.<br>
-&gt; Multi-Way PvP. The whole Wilderness is a Multi FFA (Free-For-All) Zone. As well as white portal is safe, but Multi, as well as red. I might make red portal Non-Multi though, so players can 1v1 without being pj’d and bitching to us.</p>
<p><em>Future Updates That Will Be Completed by June 20th, 2011.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Working Quest to access the Ancient Magiks.<br>
-&gt; Makka mentioned he wants a Defense level to be required too cast Vengeance, as Pures with Venge rape lol. xD.<br>
-&gt; Correct runes needed to cast Teleport Spellz.<br>
-&gt; I got a “basic” highscores layout on my Computer… though our website is still being sorted out with teh fuckin webhoster.<br>
-&gt; Gonna add some different “NPC’s” to be available for teh Slayer Skill.<br>
-&gt; Working NPC Communication Spell to talk to NPC’s through out Microfire that would be important. (Slayer Masters, etc.) (I got 99 mage on real rs and lunars and i still dont kno teh spell lmao…)<br>
-&gt; Veng other, if not working.<br>
-&gt; Plan on adding Clan Wars ^^.<br>
-&gt; Better Summoning.<br>
-&gt; Bolts/Arrows for Ranging should actually give a bonus? Lol? I Log on most servers and equip bolts and they have no bonus =S. Will add bonuses accordingly to the type of bolts/arrow.<br>
-&gt; Runes needed to cast any spell I guess… I Don’t know if players will like this though lol.<br>
-&gt; Bones too be used on Altar.<br>
-&gt; Changing Drop Rates.<br>
-&gt; Adjusting some Item Prices / Bonuses with Makka when he gets’ on.<br>
-&gt; Commands… Commands… and MORE COMMANDS =D. <em>cries</em>.<br>
-&gt; Players will have to Farm their herbs instead of being able to buy from shops… dunno up to makka xD.<br>
-&gt; More too come ;].</p>
<p>=================================================================</p>
<p>If Connor is still working on the 317 though, I’ll edit this post and just post like an inspirational gl or something. If he stays and we’re done I guess this can be deleted, as Makka will create a new Server Dev Page  :rolleyes:</p>
<p>(Sorry was watching Napoleon Dynamite while typing this lol xD).</p>
<p>If your interested in joining you can add makka or me on MSN for now.</p>
