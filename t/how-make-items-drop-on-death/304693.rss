    <title>How Make Items drop on death?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-make-items-drop-on-death/304693</link>
    <description>Ok, here is my problem; im using a dodian based source, have awesome drops and got npcs to attack and deal damage and all, but then it became annoying because its pointless coding that when players can just die and teleport back and start attacking the npc again with all there items.... I was hoping that someone can help me out by giving me ints for making players lose items on regular deaths :confused: 
thanks,
