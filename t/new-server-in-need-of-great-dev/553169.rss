    <title>New server in need of great DEV!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-server-in-need-of-great-dev/553169</link>
    <description>Hey guys, my friends and i are looking for an awesome dev to help bring some of our ideas to life in our 317 server. We are willing to pay if the services are adequate, and availability definitely wouldn&#39;t hurt your chances either! If you&#39;re interested in receiving more information, get in contact with us @ nicest00f on Skype.

Thanks for your interest and time in advance!
