    <title>Computer Shutting Down when Gaming</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/computer-shutting-down-when-gaming/418258</link>
    <description>Turned on Crysis 2, set graphics mode to Hardcore just to see it. Not the steadiest framerate (obvious for my specs) and after about two minutes my computer turned off. MOBO light was still on, but power button would not turn the computer on. Turning my PSU off and on didn&#39;t help. After about a minute I was able to restart. This made me think it might be overheating, but I&#39;ll provide temps later. I played it again, but with graphics mode on Advanced. I got to play for maybe 30 minutes and it did the same thing. This time, after getting past GRUB into Windows, the login screen was flickering. It was turning on and off consistently about four times a second. This was not happening during POST or GRUB, only starting at the login screen. I restarted, and the same thing happened. Although this time, it stopped a little bit after I logged in. I&#39;m wondering if my PSU is not enough anymore, or if I&#39;m overheating. 

My Specs:
ASUS P5KPL-CM
Intel C2E QX6850 @ 3.00GHz
2 x 2GB DDR2
EVGA NVIDIA GTX 570 HD SC
PSU 630W

I recently upgraded the GTX 570 from a GeForce 9800 GTX.

I have everything stock cooled and not overclocked. Using EVGA Precision, I have manually set my card to a fan speed of 65% (max was 85%). As far as I can tell, nothing is overheating. Using SpeedFan, it says that my CPU is a little too hot at 55C, but my CORE0 and CORE1 are really low at 30C. I also can&#39;t manually control my CPU fan. At idle, here are my temps:

SYSTIN: 43C
CPUTIN: 56C
AUXTIN: 65C
CORE0: 50C
CORE1: 50C
CORE2: 46C
CORE3: 49C
CORE0 (from SpeedFan): 30C
CORE1 (from SpeedFan): 30C
HD0: 39C
HD1: 41C
GPU: 48C

I do not have the temps of me playing Crisis 2 because I wasn&#39;t checking them. I am about to do that now though.</description>

              <p>From what I understand from electronics, it seems that as long as the volts and watts of the PSU is correct, the amps will be correct. Since voltage is constant, and watts is decided by amps times voltage.</p>
<p>But remember that the GPU isn’t the only thing that wants power.</p>
<p>So, if you could run the GPU in power save mode, you might prove or disprove that the PSU is the problem.</p>
<p>PS: You was aware of static electricity when you upgraded the GPU? And is it possible to run a test on the video memory (A friend suggested that it might cause such problems, and it make sense from where you said the problems appeared)</p>

It won’t turn on again unless I reset the power supply. I’m going to install the stable NVIDIA drivers, and upon a restart I will check to see if I can change the shutoff temps.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Starting to think this is a PSU issue. Card says:<br>
GTX 570 PSU Requirement: - Minimum 550W or greater system power supply (with a minimum 12V current rating of 38A)</p>
<p>I’m running this (maybe not exactly this but it is a Xion 630W:<br>
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817190017" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817190017</a></p>
<p>Doesn’t say anything near 38A. Any recommendations? I don’t know how to tell if it’s getting the correct Amps, or what to look for in a PSU that will supply what I need.</p>

              <p>The computer isn’t very hot, I think you need temps on 80-90 before the computer turns off. (My own experience).</p>
<p>Two thing I can think of: The beta driver has errors (It is a beta after all), or you screwed up when upgrading your graphics card.<br>
If not, I have no ideas.</p>
<p>From what I found, the new card uses 80-100 more watts, so the PSU might be a problem.</p>

              <p>I’ve only played Crisis 2 and Just Cause 2 since I’ve upgraded the GFX card. The room is pretty cold right now, at 68F. As far as the drivers go, I updated them to the newest beta NVIDIA drivers to play Battlefield 3, but I never got a chance to play that anyway.</p>
<p>I played Just Cause 2 for about ten minutes before quitting, so I’m not sure if it would crash when playing that.</p>
<p>I’m fairly sure it’s showing the correct temps, because EVGA Precision / SpeedFan / CPUID Hardware Monitor all show the same temperatures for each part, aside from individual cores. CPUID shows four cores each around 50C and SpeedFan shows two cores at 30C, but the CPU reading is the same for both.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I’ve been playing since I made this post that I’m updating now and I have some more numbers for you. I guess it’s been around 40 minutes and I didn’t crash, but I’m still not comfortable that I won’t.</p>
<p>Here’s the temps (only these temps changed, everything else stayed within 1-2 degrees of the original post of all the temps):</p>
<p>CPUTIN: Averaged 69C, max was 72C<br>
CORE0: Averaged 65C, max was 69C<br>
CORE1: Averaged 62C, max was 66C<br>
CORE2: Averaged 58C, max was 60C<br>
CORE3: Averaged 60C, max was 63C<br>
GPU: Averaged 59C, max was 64C</p>
<p>The previous crashes were not during any huge firefight, one during an in-game cutscene and one walking down a hallway. The max temps were only seen once, other than that it was consistently at the average temps.</p>

Would sitting in a colder room do any good? (Or sitting near a open window).</p>
<p>Does this only happen when playing Crysis?</p>
<p>Try updating your drivers, and let you PC rest a bit. (Hardware can cause temporary problems that disappear after some time off)</p>

              <p>Turned on Crysis 2, set graphics mode to Hardcore just to see it. Not the steadiest framerate (obvious for my specs) and after about two minutes my computer turned off. MOBO light was still on, but power button would not turn the computer on. Turning my PSU off and on didn’t help. After about a minute I was able to restart. This made me think it might be overheating, but I’ll provide temps later. I played it again, but with graphics mode on Advanced. I got to play for maybe 30 minutes and it did the same thing. This time, after getting past GRUB into Windows, the login screen was flickering. It was turning on and off consistently about four times a second. This was not happening during POST or GRUB, only starting at the login screen. I restarted, and the same thing happened. Although this time, it stopped a little bit after I logged in. I’m wondering if my PSU is not enough anymore, or if I’m overheating.</p>
<p>My Specs:<br>
ASUS P5KPL-CM<br>
Intel C2E QX6850 @ 3.00GHz<br>
2 x 2GB DDR2<br>
EVGA NVIDIA GTX 570 HD SC<br>
PSU 630W</p>
<p>I recently upgraded the GTX 570 from a GeForce 9800 GTX.</p>
<p>I have everything stock cooled and not overclocked. Using EVGA Precision, I have manually set my card to a fan speed of 65% (max was 85%). As far as I can tell, nothing is overheating. Using SpeedFan, it says that my CPU is a little too hot at 55C, but my CORE0 and CORE1 are really low at 30C. I also can’t manually control my CPU fan. At idle, here are my temps:</p>
<p>SYSTIN: 43C<br>
CPUTIN: 56C<br>
AUXTIN: 65C<br>
CORE0: 50C<br>
CORE1: 50C<br>
CORE2: 46C<br>
CORE3: 49C<br>
CORE0 (from SpeedFan): 30C<br>
CORE1 (from SpeedFan): 30C<br>
HD0: 39C<br>
HD1: 41C<br>
GPU: 48C</p>
<p>I do not have the temps of me playing Crisis 2 because I wasn’t checking them. I am about to do that now though.</p>
