    <description>this is the 3rd time these forums have been of no use. i am posting questions about the main server status page crashing for good. and you people dont respond to my posts. that&#39;s kinda fucked up. and also i dont give a shit if you ban me, it&#39;s happend before when there were no compitant people around to answer my fucking questions. this was my only place for refuge after learning that everything had crashed. SO, see ya later fuckers.
