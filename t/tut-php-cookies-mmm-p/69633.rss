    <title>[tut] php Cookies &lt; mmm :p</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-php-cookies-mmm-p/69633</link>
    <description>hello this is another one of my tutorials i am going to try and tell you a bit about php using cookies this is a short tutorial so don&#39;t worry :D yay and ill try and explain seen as ive seen alot of people asking how to make some things in php that need cookies or sessions to work. so here i go

ok well first what is a cookie?
well a cookie is something you eat mmmm but sadly you cant eat these :( this trpe of cookie is a small text doc that sits on your hard drive and it is set by websites to store info on your pc so when you go see that site again they know some stuff that maybe nice for you or it may be a cookie that lets the site know who you are 

so how do i set a cookie well you are jumping ahead a little there you need some things first.
[b]if you have a server and changed your host file then skip this[/b]
ok so first off go and get your self a web server if you don&#39;t have one i would say go and get this one
http://www.wampserver.com/dl.php
ok now you need to to and reed my other tut an how to change your host file here
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,76837.0.html%20url

now you can start yay!! 
so how do you set a cookie? well its easy!
it starts with a string which is setcookie then you need to add some other things in here is an example

setcookie(&quot;name of my cookie&quot;, &quot;what my cookie sayes&quot;, time()+3600*24*365, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;your site&quot;, 0);  

ok well the first part is the name of your cookie duu the second part of the cookie is
the body of your cookie whether it will be a string, session number, a bit of text, a user id what ever the next part is the time that that cookie will get deleted off of your pc or when it expires for all you posh people it is measured in seconds in a hour times 24 that&#39;s a day then times 365 that is a year that&#39;s how you do it to get 2 hours lets say you would put +3600*2 the next part is were will that cookie be available on your site the / mean all directories up and below it the next part is were is it coming from so that would be your site www.what-ever.com but to allow sub domains to use your cookies use .what-ever.com then the 0 part if you set this to &quot;1&quot; or &quot;true&quot; means only send the cookie the request happens over SSL (https) setting this to 0 or false will mean send this cookie on any request 
http or https

ok one thing a cookie must be set first before any content on your site that is a must!

to update a cookie create one with the same name like this

setcookie(&quot;name of my cookie&quot;, &quot;what my cookie sayes updated blablabla&quot;, time()+3600*24*365, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;your site&quot;, 0);  

to delete a cookie create one with the same name and set the expiry to the past which forces it to expire :D notice the - on the time instead of a +

setcookie(&quot;name of my cookie&quot;, &quot;what my cookie sayes updated blablabla&quot;, time()-3600*24*365, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;your site&quot;, 0); 

now then for the test to see if you know what you are doing

make a cookie that sayes hello your name

like this

setcookie(&quot;my_first_cookie&quot;, &quot;Hello N00b1 im DOING THIS YAY&quot;, time()+3600*24*365, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;www.mylocalhost.com&quot;, 0); 

now to call your cookie and echo it out

little info on how to call a cookie you just use  $_COOKIE[&#39;name&#39;] $_COOKIE is a super global array (big words i know)

echo $_COOKIE[&#39;my_first_cookie&#39;];

to put it together for you 

[code]
&lt;php
setcookie(&quot;my_first_cookie&quot;, &quot;Hello N00b1 im DOING THIS YAY&quot;, time()+3600*24*365, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;www.mylocalhost.com&quot;, 0); 
//easy eh..?
echo $_COOKIE[&#39;my_first_cookie&#39;];
?&gt;
[/code]

now then lets use cookies in a page to see how many times i have vistied www.moparisthebest.com
so you would first open yp your php tags

&lt;?php
//first off we would add one to a varible
  $visits = $_COOKIE[&#39;visits_to_moparisthebest&#39;] + 1
  
// create or update our cookie mmmm cookie
  setcookie(&quot;visits_to_moparisthebest&quot;, $visits, time()+3600*24*365, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;moparisthebest.com&quot;, 0);
  
  	// if we have more than one visit to moparisthebest.com obviousley...duu
  if($visits &gt; 1) {
		
	  echo &quot;you have visited moparisthebest.com $visits times W00t&quot;;
		
  } else {
    		// must be your first visit here OMG!!
		echo &quot;Welcome to the moparisthebest.com i cant beleve you have never been here before!&quot;;
		
	}
		
?&gt;

well that&#39;s a simple counter you could add some things like if you visit more than 100 times your l33t if you visit more than 1000 your a G0D

well that is all i can think of about cookies at this time if you want more or i have missed out something or even if you want me to help you on something then post here!
