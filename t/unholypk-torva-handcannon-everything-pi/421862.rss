    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unholypk-torva-handcannon-everything-pi/421862</link>
    <description>Well im kinda new to coding and I would LOVE to have a few pro&#39;s help me with my first real &quot;project&quot;.
I&#39;m using torvapkz base, its a PI.

Things I need:
[template]:
name:
real life name:
how do you want to be called:
MSN name:
skype (no webcam atm, sorry!):
proof of work:
time: (amount of time you are willing to spend on this)
computer stability:
orther things you might want to tell:
[/template]

Modeller(s) [0/2]
animation maker(s) [0/2]
source coders [0/3]
client coders [0/3]
hoster (can be me, but I can&#39;t portfoward as the password of my modem should be beneath it but it isn&#39;t) [0/1]
NOTE THAT NOT ALL OF THOSE PLACES HAVE TO BE TAKEN, ITS JUST THE MAX THAT I&#39;LL BE TAKING

planned projects:

more bosses
much pk area&#39;s
prices of items/shops/amounts of items in shops COMPLETELY BALANCED
100% pking, staking, trading etc without dupes (already has as far as I know)
voting with choiche of good rewards
100% working auto donating system, winch allows credit cards, wallie cards, paypal, IDEAL, and paybyphone services
orther, small things like giving torva healing and handcannon firing
A LOT of unique stuff, like unique self-made bosses, items (no black phats, or orther awfull recolorings of things, only really UNIQUE items that don&#39;t resemble rs items but recolored), self made minigames, and all that sort of FUN stuff!

For example, I already have an costum area in mind with new armour and weapons, new npc&#39;s, a new minigame, etc

pictures will come once I get em!!
