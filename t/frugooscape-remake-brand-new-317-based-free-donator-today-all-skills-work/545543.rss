    <description>[Combat] http://thugscape.enjin.com/
+ insta-kill throwing axe added (but not in shop) [Thanks to Disvirus for the motivation and idea to add it] --&gt; You have to make a way for players to access it. Original idea was to put it in member shop but I never got around to it. The item exists, but it&#39;s not in shops, and the price is 1 gp. You can change that
+ New hell run section (Hard training ground)
+ advanced weapon shop
+ Magic teleports (Varrock, lumbridge, falador teleport buttons) now give experience

[Event]
+ Dialogues for quest no longer interfere with other dialogues
+ Removed some teleport commands for realistic play
+ made npcs teleport you instead
+ New tutorial island (trapped on an island, more fun atmosphere)
+ added a dialogue for quest cape
+ Waldo npc, add in for hide and seek event. (Lmfao, I was high.) [The dialogue is already added, you just have to add the ints and rewards

[NPCs]
+ Fixed the npcs not dropping items
+ Added Strider npc which is a teleport npc for combat
+ Added Slifer npc (same concept as strider) for skilling teleports
+ 1 click interaction works
+ Added onyx drop from tzhaar npcs

[Minigames]
+ Beacon minigame is more automatic for players
+ Beacon rewards now give boosted firemaking exp

[Skilling]
+ Bonfires are now automatic (click fire address cube and it performs bonfires)
+ Construction bench added
+ Made leveling up give server points based on the levels you are at (EG; under level 40, gives 5 server points, above 40 gives 25 server points, above 100 gives 200 server points)

[Misc]
+ Changed 126/99 bug in skills tab to 126/126
+ Play time is steady now
+ Skrillaphat npc gives cape now
+ Shop buying glitches fixed 
+ Home changed to Grand Exchange (upon request)
+ Torva Effects added (Operate Torva Armour when wearing all pieces) [Healing occurs automatically after activated] --&gt; I wasn&#39;t sure how torva effect worked, sorry lmfao
+ Godmode now gives 188 (10+ bonus to max combat, appears as 700 in player list) Combat level and crazy hitpoints
+ Dropping items now works
+ Some new shops

Plus reading your reaction etc, i don’t think you’re a good owner anyways.</p>
<p>This so called ‘stripclub’ you made, is full of wrong places objects etc.<br>
In other words, it looks like crap…</p>
<p>Non the less good luck on this project.</p>
