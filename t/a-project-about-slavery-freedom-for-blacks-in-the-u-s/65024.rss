    <description>For anyone who wants to know, or just anyone in general. The reason I&#39;ve been asking for alot of homework help, etc. is because that I havent really done any work for over 2 years in school and I&#39;m starting to do better in school, and I don&#39;t want to screw it up.

Early Slavery
African slaves were transported to Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central &amp; South America, starting very early in the 16th century. Owners of land in the colonies in America started to meet their need for forced labor by having a limited number of slaves, and buying more European servants. In exchange for transportation across the Atlantic Ocean, the servants worked for the owner for 4-7 years.
 A few slaves from Africa were deported as early as 1619. With the spread of tobacco farming in the mid-late 1600’s, and the decreasing number of servants wanting to work in the 1680’s, which was increasing the number of slaves captured and deported in Africa. They replaced the Native American slaves, who were suspected to be vulnerable to diseases from Europe. “…a small number of white people were also enslaved by kidnapping, or for crimes or debts.”
 The Africans cane from many tribes, such as the Yorubas, the Lgbos, the Ashantis, and more. Eventually more than six hundred thousand slaves arrived in North America, Central America, and South America, against their will.
	United States was not the only harsh country. Slavery was also very brutal in Canada. Marie-Joseph-Angelique, objected to slavery and herself being sold. She burned down her owner&#39;s home in Montreal in protest. The fire spread and destroyed 46 buildings. Her sentence was to have her hands chopped off and then to be set on fire. This sentence was reduced to a hanging.
	The average price of a black male was about $27.00. This price was a very tempting bargain, seeing as how they made $1,000.00’s per year. The European laborer’s price was 70 cents per day. The slaves were cheaper than the European slaves for the time being. And the price of slaves were rising, mainly because the mortality rate was 50%, and the slaves died of diseases, poor hygiene, starvation, and dehydration. With all the slaves having to be caught and shipped, and with half of them dying on the way, the slave catchers weren’t getting as much money as they should, so they eventually raised the prices of slaves.
Late slavery to freedom
	The North got tired of slavery, and made it illegal in the Northern states. They tried to get rid of it in the South, but they did not succeed. The South believed that it was their right to choose if they had slavery legalized, or illegalized. Tensions rose drastically, even the politicians had fudes. With a new territory, many Northerners rushed into the state to vote for the abolishment of slavery in the new territory. As a result, the senate was packed full of proslavery representatives.
	As the tensions rose even higher, the South got fed up with the North and succeeded from the Union. All the territories in the new confederacy were their property, except for Fort Sumter. The South took over Fort Sumter, and at the moment the North did not do anything. But later on, the North took back Fort Sumter, and the South declared it an act of war, and this officially started the Civil War.</description>
