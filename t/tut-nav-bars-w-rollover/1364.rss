    <title>=[TUT]= Nav Bars w/ Rollover</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-nav-bars-w-rollover/1364</link>
    <description>[b]INTRO[/b]
This tutorial&#39;s version is: v1.0

By the end of this tutorial you should have:

[ul][li]Learned the use of Hotspots[/li]
[li]Learned the use of the onMouseOver function[/li][/ul]

Alright the programs I used to make this tutorial are the following:

Adobe Photoshop CS2
[URL=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,1187.0.html]Macromedia Dreamweaver 8[/URL]


[b]Table Of Contents[/b]

[ul][li]INTRO[/li]
[li]A - Making Your Image[/li]
[li]B - Creating The Rollover Images[/li]
[li]C - Creating A Basic Page In Dreamweaver[/li]
[li]D - Inserting The Navbar[/li]
[li]E - Applying The Rollovers[/li]
[li]F - Misc.[/li][/ul]



[b]A - Making Your Image[/b]

[ul][li]Open up your program of choice [mine in this case is Adobe Photoshop CS2]
[/li]
[li][URL=http://img83.imageshack.us/img83/592/navbarbasic5tt.jpg]Create your basic navigational bar [or column if you so please][/URL][/li]
[li][URL=http://img83.imageshack.us/img83/6590/navbar7fn.jpg]I personally hate really plain websites, so I&#39;ll spruce it up a bit.  This will also give me the possibility of a nice roll over function.[/URL] VERY IMPORTANT![/li][/ul]



[b]B - Creating The Rollover Images[/b]
Please note that this is not the coding that will do the rollovers, merely the images that the rollover function will call.
Also note that this is not the only form of rollover, and if you are not using Photoshop, you will probably need to just change the colour of your links or something to show a contrast between normal and with the mouse over it.

[ul][li][URL=http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/8008/navbarh3va.jpg]If you did a Navbar similar to my own, with bubbly text, simply reverse the Bevel to downward.[/URL][/li]
[li][URL=http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/7645/navbarf9sq.jpg]Continue making the rollovers until all your links have their own SEPARATE image.[/URL][/li]
[li]BE VERY SURE TO SAVE EACH ROLLOVER AS THEIR OWN IMAGE!!![/li][/ul]



[b]C - Creating A Basic Page In Dreamweaver[/b]
Please note that I am useing Version 8 of Dreamweaver, any older versions should still have what I am about to show, though if you do not have these options, go [URL=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,1187.0.html]here[/URL].

[ul][li]Run Dreamweaver and create a new HTML page [if you have a page already made, you can pretty much skip this section][/li]
[li][URL=http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/4162/tablespecs2sg.jpg]This is going to be amazingly basic, but create a table by going to Insert &gt; Table with these specs.[/URL][/li]
[li]Color the page however you want, it shouldn&#39;t really matter though.  I should hope all of you can make a better page for the use of this kick ass navbar :P[/li][/ul]



[b]D - Inserting The Navbar[/b]

[ul][li]I guess it might be necessary to say this one:  Goto Insert &gt; Image and then find where you image is located in relation to the HTML page.[/li][/ul]



[b]E - Applying The Rollovers[/b]
Here really there are two options, you can not do step D and just insert a Image Objects &gt; Navigational Bar [wish I had seen that before I typed this whole tutorial &gt;.&lt;, though you cannot as far as I know use only one image at a time], or you can follow my steps below.

[ul][li]Click on your image[/li]
[li]Goto Windows &gt; Properties to ensure that it is open.[/li]
[li][URL=http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/1550/maplocation0zy.jpg]Go down to where you should see something named &#39;map&#39;.[/URL]  Also, while you are on the properties bar, name your actual Image [right above map].[/li]
[li]Name your new image map[not really necessary, but it is suggested][/li]
[li][URL=http://img133.imageshack.us/img133/271/hotspot3ck.jpg]Use the tool below the name that looks like a rectangle with a star in the left corner and draw on your hotspots. [image is a hotspot that is drawn].[/URL][/li]
[li]Continue until all possible links are accounted for[/li]
[li]Now, click on a hotspot[/li]
[li]Go down to properties and link it to another webpage of your choice[/li]
[li]Now go up to Windows &gt; Behaviors[/li]
[li]Add a new behavior by clicking on the plus sign [looks like this: + ,].  Make the behavior Swap Image.  &lt;--IMPORTANT![/li]
[li]If you Do Not have Swap Image as one of your options,: goto &#39;Show Events For&#39; &gt; then a different browser/HTML version, or goto &#39;Get More Behaviors...&#39;[/li]
[li]Click browse and find the rollover image that relates to the current Hotspot[/li]
[li]Make sure &#39;Preload images&#39; and &#39;Restore images onMouseOut&#39; are checked!!!  Then hit OK.[/li]
[li]If for some reason your Dreamweaver does not automatically set the Swap Image to onMouseOver, change it in the Behaviors Window!![/li]
[li]Repeat the Hotspot linking/rollovering until all are accounted for[/li][/ul]



[b]F - Misc[/b]
You should now have a working Navigational Bar[or column] that is functional and works great!

If you&#39;ve found that I&#39;ve left something out, or my tutorial did not work for you, please post your errors and I will help you and make revisions.


Enjoy my first ever Tutorial :D</description>
