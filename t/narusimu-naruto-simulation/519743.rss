[b][size=18pt]Welcome to Narusimu.[/size][/b]


At last, after many months of development since the first time I&#39;ve had the thought of this project (September 2012), I present to you Narusimu.


The first and only 3D Naruto Simulation Game in the world. Not only that, it is also the first 3D Naruto smartphone game. The project has the goal of simulating the Universe of Naruto as accurate as possible in the form of a 3D MMO action RPG. It is currently being developed for web browsers and Android devices.


My name is Vreg. I am the only developer of Narusimu at the moment.

[i][size=15pt]About[/size][/i]
[hr]
Back in 2012, I&#39;ve wanted to play a free 3D Naruto simulation game. I am a big fan of the ways of Naruto&#39;s universe. I&#39;m talking about the politics, the economy, the landscape, the way chakra works,... Watching the show was not enough for me. I had found out that Naruto games were out of the question, so I had decided to make my own. I&#39;m a computer expert in many fields, so developing a game wasn&#39;t impossible. At the time, I had just started my senior highschool year and in Belgium there&#39;s this thing called a senior year integration project. This game I had in mind would be perfect for that integration project. And yes I&#39;m in highschool, but one more month and I&#39;m free from this hell.


So that&#39;s how this project started and became my senior year integration project. From September to December, most of the actual game development happened. From January to now, I documented the development of Narusimu for the integration project. The result was a book of 111 pages. Funny thing is, it only covered about 1/5 of the development. I also made some adjustments to the game and I made narusimu.com.


Obviously it&#39;s more of a project than a game right now, but that will change in time. Currently, the development team consists out of a one man army (me). That&#39;s why development takes time. Therefore, waiting until the game is finished before making a release, is very uninteresting. That&#39;s why I decided to release a new version of Narusimu after every couple of updates I make to the game. Most of these updates will be based on community suggestions. Suggestions can be about new content or about making changes to the existing project. Suggestions can be submitted in the Narusimu Suggestions board. If I like an idea or an idea gets enough community votes, it&#39;ll probably be put into development. It&#39;s safe to say that Narusimu is heavily dependant on it&#39;s community.


[i][size=15pt]Simulation[/size][/i]
[hr]
The goal of Narusimu is to eventually become an MMO action role playing game. Unlike in those Xbox 360 and PS3 Naruto games, where all you have to do is 3 minute fights, Narusimu&#39;s goal is to make the player feel like he&#39;s part of some alternative reality, the Naruto universe. I plan to accomplish this goal by recreating that universe as accurate as possible. E.g. in Narusimu, you don&#39;t have to press a button to perform a jutsu, you&#39;ll have to perform the right hand seal combination first. The hand seal combinations for jutsus are based on the actual combinations we&#39;ve seen in Naruto. That&#39;s just an example of how Narusimu is different from anything we&#39;ve seen before.


[i][size=15pt]Platforms[/size][/i]
[hr]
As mentioned before, Narusimu is only being developed for web browsers and Android. I want to do iOS development aswell, but I don&#39;t have an iOS enabled device and a Mac computer. It&#39;ll be up to the community to support me with donations, if they want to see an iOS version of Narusimu.


[i][size=15pt]Multiplayer[/size][/i]
[hr]
Narusimu has the goal of becoming an MMOARPG (action RPG). So naturally it is being developed as a multiplayer game. I have a server design that utilizes our webserver as some sort of master server and lets the players host the actual game servers. This saves me from costs but limits our game servers to the power of average PCs. Dedicated servers that can hold 1000+ players at once will require donations (see below).


[i][size=15pt]Donations[/size][/i]
[hr]
Narusimu does not generate any revenue. A project like Narusimu needs funding. It is simply not possible for the project to grow without money. That is why donations are essential for keeping the project alive and ensuring a bright future for it.


Here are a couple of examples on what donations will be used for:

[ul][li][b]Engine Upgrade[/b]
Narusimu is powered by Unity Engine. Currently I have $ 1 000 worth of licensing, this enables me to do development for Android, iOS and web browsers with Unity Engine&#39;s basic functionality. If we ever want to use Unity Engine with professional functionality, we&#39;ll need to upgrade the licensing. What&#39;s even more disturbing is that my licensing only covers development with the 3rd generation of Unity Engine. Unity Engine is on it&#39;s 4th generation at the moment. Making the engine upgrade would cost $ 5 625.[/li]
	[li][b]Multiplayer[/b]
If we ever want to consider real-time wars with 1000+ players, we&#39;ll need dedicated game servers. Unfortunately game servers are expensive, and expensive is an amount of money I don&#39;t have.[/li]
	[li][b]Google Play Store[/b]
Getting the Android version of Narusimu on the Google Play Store will cost money.[/li]
	[li][b]Apple App Store[/b]
Getting a future iOS version of Narusimu on the Apple App Store will also cost money.[/li]
	[li][b]iOS Development[/b]
Development for iOS requires me to have an iOS enabled device and a Mac computer. Unfortunately, those are 2 things I don&#39;t have.[/li]
	[li][b]Premium Hosting[/b]
The website and forum use free web hosting, this makes them slow and limited. If we ever want a fast website and forum, we&#39;ll need to get premium web hosting. This obviously costs money.[/li][/ul]


[i][size=15pt]Copyrights[/size][/i]
[hr]
I am well aware of the fact that some day I may be confronted with legal issues with the owners of Naruto. This is unlikely though, since I&#39;m not asking people to buy Narusimu. But even so, I&#39;m developing Narusimu in a way that it won&#39;t take too much effort to break all connections with Naruto and free Narusimu from copyright infrigement.


[i][size=15pt]Testing[/size][/i]
[hr]
Testing Narusimu can be done by anyone on the official Narusimu website.


[i][size=15pt]Trailer[/size][/i]
[hr]
I&#39;ve put a quick trailer together, demonstrating Narusimu as it is now. 


[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFGlwmvgvgc[/youtube]


[i][size=15pt]Website and Forum[/size][/i]
[hr]
Making the Narusimu website and forum were a huge pain. But they&#39;re finally finished and ready for you to check them out:


Narusimu Website: [url=http://www.narusimu.com]http://www.narusimu.com[/url]
Narusimu Forum: [url=http://www.narusimu.com/forum/]http://www.narusimu.com/forum/[/url]


[i][size=15pt]That&#39;s all folks![/size][/i]
[hr]
Thanks for reading all of this! I hope I didn&#39;t miss out on anything, I&#39;m looking forward to seeing the game grow.</description>

<p>[quote=“LilXCj, post:6, topic:519743”]There’s something I want to comment on how you will handle ninjutsu. You say that people will be using the appropriate hand seals which I assume, that for smartphones with touch capability, would be finger input combinations. In the early points of the show, ninjutsu hand seals were played down in their speed because everyone was genin. By the time the show progresses to shippuden, the entirety of hand seals nearly disappears because it is assumed that everyone’s hand seal formation time is too quick (because each seal is like a collection of chakra, as people become more experienced, the less hand seals they need) that it would be a waste of time animating. For a smartphone game, the beginning would be overflowed with grinding, much like traditional JRPG games run. While the idea seems great for web browser based gameplay, I have trouble seeing it work out as well on smartphones.</p>
<p>How will you address progression throughout the Narutoverse? Will you keep it linear or force the player to spend time practicing techniques in order to master skills (capped at certain chapters of the story to prevent overleveling)?</p>
<p>As current Naruto games stand, you progress through the story line via battle and avoid most of the development that the cast goes through by sending them through cutscenes or runtime events.</p>
<p>How will you handle the tutorial systems? Are you willing to give them everything on a silver platter or will you incorporate puzzles which force the player to think creatively in order to master the controls you give them?</p>
<p>The development looks nice, I like the concept and the current progress is enviable. Great job.[/quote]I’m glad to see such a constructive reaction.</p>
<p>About the seals:<br>
There are 12 basic hand seals and most jutsu need a fixed combination of those basic hand seals to be performed. While not always shown in the anime or manga, there is official data available on most jutsu and their seals. Masashi Kishimoto has written 5 books about the Naruto Universe, stuff you don’t see in the manga or anime. Those books have all the data we need for creating the best possible simulation. They’re not just about jutsu, they’re also about the Naruto Universe in general.</p>
<p>It is true, the more experience, the less seals. But that could also be incorporated into Narusimu. Mastering a jutsu would not stop with being able to perform it for the first time. Players would gain jutsu specific expererience, making their jutsu stronger the more they use it, to a point where they can perform it without seals. Before this would be possible, players would have to use a specific jutsu a lot with the seals, because experience won’t grow on trees.</p>
<p>For performing hand seals on smartphones, there are 3 buttons. Each one is responsible for 4 seals. Based on how you use a button, you can perform one of the 4 seals it represents. Therefore resulting in 12 seals total for 3 buttons. The smartphone version isn’t too far stretched from the web browser version. I haven’t released the Android app yet, but I can tell that it’s just as nice as what you can already test in your browser.</p>
<p>It’s kinda late (2:16 am) and I got school tommorow so I’ll answer one more question, the rest I’ll cover tommorow.</p>
<p>The idea is, that when you create your character, you get to chose the primary chakra nature. This enables you to master jutsu for that chakra nature. When you turn jonin, which won’t be something you can do in day, you’re given the option to master a secondary chakra nature. This will enable mastering jutsu from yet another chakra nature. Now since this is a simulation, I’m going to make it so that you can only learn a limited number of jutsu. Your character represents you in that alternate world, and you wouldn’t be able to master all fire style jutsu or all water style jutsu. You’d be able to focus on maybe 2 or 3 jutsu for each nature, learn how to combine them and use them efficiently. While you’ll be given a lot different jutsu to choose from, just like in Naruto, you can only advance in a few.</p>
<p>So why are there many jutsu if you can only master a few? Simple, because that would create diversity in people in the Narusimu world. Where’s the fun when everyone has the same abilities.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=18pt]Welcome to Narusimu.[/size]</span></p>
<p>At last, after many months of development since the first time I’ve had the thought of this project (September 2012), I present to you Narusimu.</p>
<p>The first and only 3D Naruto Simulation Game in the world. Not only that, it is also the first 3D Naruto smartphone game. The project has the goal of simulating the Universe of Naruto as accurate as possible in the form of a 3D MMO action RPG. It is currently being developed for web browsers and Android devices.</p>
<p>My name is Vreg. I am the only developer of Narusimu at the moment.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=15pt]About[/size]</span><br>
[hr]<br>
Back in 2012, I’ve wanted to play a free 3D Naruto simulation game. I am a big fan of the ways of Naruto’s universe. I’m talking about the politics, the economy, the landscape, the way chakra works,… Watching the show was not enough for me. I had found out that Naruto games were out of the question, so I had decided to make my own. I’m a computer expert in many fields, so developing a game wasn’t impossible. At the time, I had just started my senior highschool year and in Belgium there’s this thing called a senior year integration project. This game I had in mind would be perfect for that integration project. And yes I’m in highschool, but one more month and I’m free from this hell.</p>
<p>So that’s how this project started and became my senior year integration project. From September to December, most of the actual game development happened. From January to now, I documented the development of Narusimu for the integration project. The result was a book of 111 pages. Funny thing is, it only covered about 1/5 of the development. I also made some adjustments to the game and I made <a href="http://narusimu.com" rel="nofollow noopener">narusimu.com</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously it’s more of a project than a game right now, but that will change in time. Currently, the development team consists out of a one man army (me). That’s why development takes time. Therefore, waiting until the game is finished before making a release, is very uninteresting. That’s why I decided to release a new version of Narusimu after every couple of updates I make to the game. Most of these updates will be based on community suggestions. Suggestions can be about new content or about making changes to the existing project. Suggestions can be submitted in the Narusimu Suggestions board. If I like an idea or an idea gets enough community votes, it’ll probably be put into development. It’s safe to say that Narusimu is heavily dependant on it’s community.</p>

The goal of Narusimu is to eventually become an MMO action role playing game. Unlike in those Xbox 360 and PS3 Naruto games, where all you have to do is 3 minute fights, Narusimu’s goal is to make the player feel like he’s part of some alternative reality, the Naruto universe. I plan to accomplish this goal by recreating that universe as accurate as possible. E.g. in Narusimu, you don’t have to press a button to perform a jutsu, you’ll have to perform the right hand seal combination first. The hand seal combinations for jutsus are based on the actual combinations we’ve seen in Naruto. That’s just an example of how Narusimu is different from anything we’ve seen before.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=15pt]Platforms[/size]</span><br>
[hr]<br>
As mentioned before, Narusimu is only being developed for web browsers and Android. I want to do iOS development aswell, but I don’t have an iOS enabled device and a Mac computer. It’ll be up to the community to support me with donations, if they want to see an iOS version of Narusimu.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=15pt]Multiplayer[/size]</span><br>
[hr]<br>
Narusimu has the goal of becoming an MMOARPG (action RPG). So naturally it is being developed as a multiplayer game. I have a server design that utilizes our webserver as some sort of master server and lets the players host the actual game servers. This saves me from costs but limits our game servers to the power of average PCs. Dedicated servers that can hold 1000+ players at once will require donations (see below).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=15pt]Donations[/size]</span><br>
[hr]<br>
Narusimu does not generate any revenue. A project like Narusimu needs funding. It is simply not possible for the project to grow without money. That is why donations are essential for keeping the project alive and ensuring a bright future for it.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples on what donations will be used for:</p>
<p>[ul][li]<span class="bbcode-b">Engine Upgrade</span><br>
Narusimu is powered by Unity Engine. Currently I have $ 1 000 worth of licensing, this enables me to do development for Android, iOS and web browsers with Unity Engine’s basic functionality. If we ever want to use Unity Engine with professional functionality, we’ll need to upgrade the licensing. What’s even more disturbing is that my licensing only covers development with the 3rd generation of Unity Engine. Unity Engine is on it’s 4th generation at the moment. Making the engine upgrade would cost $ 5 625.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Multiplayer</span><br>
If we ever want to consider real-time wars with 1000+ players, we’ll need dedicated game servers. Unfortunately game servers are expensive, and expensive is an amount of money I don’t have.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Google Play Store</span><br>
Getting the Android version of Narusimu on the Google Play Store will cost money.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Apple App Store</span><br>
Getting a future iOS version of Narusimu on the Apple App Store will also cost money.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">iOS Development</span><br>
Development for iOS requires me to have an iOS enabled device and a Mac computer. Unfortunately, those are 2 things I don’t have.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Premium Hosting</span><br>
The website and forum use free web hosting, this makes them slow and limited. If we ever want a fast website and forum, we’ll need to get premium web hosting. This obviously costs money.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=15pt]Copyrights[/size]</span><br>
[hr]<br>
I am well aware of the fact that some day I may be confronted with legal issues with the owners of Naruto. This is unlikely though, since I’m not asking people to buy Narusimu. But even so, I’m developing Narusimu in a way that it won’t take too much effort to break all connections with Naruto and free Narusimu from copyright infrigement.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=15pt]Testing[/size]</span><br>
[hr]<br>
Testing Narusimu can be done by anyone on the official Narusimu website.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=15pt]Trailer[/size]</span><br>
[hr]<br>
I’ve put a quick trailer together, demonstrating Narusimu as it is now.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=15pt]Website and Forum[/size]</span><br>
[hr]<br>
Making the Narusimu website and forum were a huge pain. But they’re finally finished and ready for you to check them out:</p>
<p>Narusimu Website: <a href="http://www.narusimu.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.narusimu.com</a><br>
Narusimu Forum: <a href="http://www.narusimu.com/forum/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.narusimu.com/forum/</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=15pt]That’s all folks![/size]</span><br>
[hr]<br>
Thanks for reading all of this! I hope I didn’t miss out on anything, I’m looking forward to seeing the game grow.</p>
