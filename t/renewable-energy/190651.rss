    <description>If every town invested in 20 wind turbines.
If every roof was covered in solar panels.
If we packed all our garbage into a spaceship and sent it into the sun/to another planet?

Wouldn&#39;t it be a better world?

I would like to look into renewable energy more, but I cannot be bothered to scowl google.

What crazy ideas have you got that could make the world a better place?

For example: Legalising all drugs. [I sort of agree with this]</description>

No, not wash your clothes.<br>
You just go in the shower with your clothes on.</p>

              <p>Ye, I have one of those energy efficient bulbs and they take ages to ‘warm’ up.

Mythbusters accidentally proved it.</p>
<p>We are getting a few wind turbines near were I live, I just want to cover all the signs that say:<br>
[center]NO<br>
Wind<br>
Turbines<br>
Here<br>
[/center]</p>
<p>I want to cover the part that says no and add a please or take them down. I asked my dad what he thinks, hes kinda pissed off that Holland, Denmark, (Places like that or <span class="bbcode-b">near</span> it) Tried this stuff 10 years ago, and it didn’t work. I want to move to California, as much as I hate the fucking stupid half-arsed americans, Arnold Schwarzenegger and his country of ‘green’ living makes me want to go there. The car my mums getting near the end of march wouldn’t be allowed in California, its not efficient enough.</p>
<p>Down in Cornwall they have wind turbines… When I say have I mean A LOT.</p>

<p>I would like to look into renewable energy more, but I cannot be bothered to scowl google.</p>
