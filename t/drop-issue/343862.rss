Can someone tell me how to turn on drops, I know its in my client.java file in my source folder, but idk what to search and to turn from &quot;false;&quot; to &quot;true;&quot;</description>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (token.equals("drop")) {</code></pre>
<p>Something in the lines following it is telling the server to delete the item, rather than drop it.<br>
If you want, you can try to replace whatever that statement does with this…</p>
<p><code>				if (token.equals("drop")) {
					int id = Integer.parseInt(token3[0]);
					int x = Integer.parseInt(token3[1]);
					int y = Integer.parseInt(token3[2]);
					int amount = Integer.parseInt(token3[3]);
					for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5000; i++) {
						createItemAll(id, x, y, amount, globalItemController[i]);
					}
				}</code></p>
