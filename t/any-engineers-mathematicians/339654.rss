<p>you are 100% right :p, last time i took english was in grade 12. i admit it, i suck at english, since its not my first language, and i been learning this language for about 5 years.</p>
<p>however i do enjoy Shakespearean plays.</p>

waterloo is known for engineering, its far better than uoft. uoft is considered the best in canada overall because its the oldest[/quote]</p>
<p>lol not because its oldest, waterloo is only known for its co-op program, what makes uoft better? it supports and mainly focus it self on research, also uoft got something called PEY, that means you get to work 12-16 months cts, not 4 months back and forth, that means where ever you work you’d be there for year+ and they would trust you on bigger projects, if you go back and forth for 4 months you wouldn’t get to know you employer as much. i got into waterloo, chose uoft, cause its better, closer and well its in the heart of downtown, where waterloo well there is nothing much around. i am not saying uoft is way better, in some aspects it is and in some its not.</p>
<p>uoft <span class="hashtag">#8th</span> in world for engineering.<br>
