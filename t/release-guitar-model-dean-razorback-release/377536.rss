    <description>[size=24pt][b][u]Guitar Model[/u][/b][/size]
[size=18pt]Modeled by WhitesWolves[/size]

[u]Description[/u]
   This is a model i made a year or so back (it was actually my third model). It is a model of the Dean Razorback Dimebag guitar (a well known and respected instrument). i personally think that it&#39;s a very nice guitar with an outstanding design, i couldn&#39;t resist and had to model it, i was still very new to 3d modeling at the time so it took me roughly 10 hours (i fond memories of that time). The only thing it lacks are:strings, whammy bar(which is not necessary). These can be easily added.

[u]Reason for releasing after all this time[/u]
   Well after coming across what i consider an ancient relic, i decided i should give out to all you good people. i originally planned on releasing it on a server which me and a buddy had planned, but unfortunately it wasn&#39;t made.

    I hope you guys all put it to good use, i feel a little empty inside when i know this model hasn&#39;t ever been able to make it into a server. 



[size=24pt][u]Problem[/u][/size]
the only issue (well at least for some) is that this is a raw file saved in the format of mqo. (metasequio) it is shaped and ready to be put in-game, and if any adjustments are desired, it is possible to edit and improve it from metasequio (or other 3d modeling programs if you convert it to a different file type).

[size=24pt][u]Request[/u][/size]
I would deeply appreciate it if someone took a screen shot of them wielding the guitar, it would fulfill the little hole that it has left in me, and i would i be so happy.

By the way, i originally thought this would look good mixed in with the air guitar emote. just an idea for you outstanding coders!



well enough of the chit chat, here&#39;s what the actual model looks like:

Here&#39;s the link, i know the link url is weird, and when you go on there&#39;s some ad, but apparently you can skip it and get right to the download, it makes me 1 cent per 10 clicks, and since wildy in the real rs might come back, i thought i  might save up for membership with it and play again (to remember my childhood). i&#39;m not sure whether adding the add is against the forums policies, i&#39;m am not sure, if so, please inform me.
