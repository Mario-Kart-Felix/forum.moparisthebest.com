<p>disallowing games that aren’t created in Java to flourish on the forum isn’t going to point people in the right direction if they want a career in game programming where C++ is the primary language of choice. of course, let people use Java and actively promote it but don’t forget that the industry wants more.</p>

Java can have more of a part, but will it happen? again, if there’s more emphasis on Java then that’s fine however I don’t agree with complete censorship of games written in other languages simply because one person wants it that way. i also have a feeling that you don’t understand the gaming industry as a whole, just because java can have a bigger place in the industry doesn’t necessarily mean it will and i personally believe that C# will eventually become just as popular as C++ and Java will be left behind a bit (just look at the progress of language evolution and how much java7 didn’t add when it could have. compare to C++0x/11 and iterations in C#). tell me one thing, why does the game industry prefer C++ over Java? work it out</p>

        <p>I think people should probably learn that they can’t set store in the language itself as to whether a not a game becomes successful. The reason the industry is mostly C++ or C# isn’t because those are better language, it’s just because that’s the way the band wagon rolls. If you have a good game, the players don’t give a crap about what it’s written in, (though if you use a cross platform language, you can ‘technically’ have a larger player base) it’s all about the game play. So why are people using C++ instead of Java? I think it’s partially because it’s just more people that know the language. Java has just as much potential to create a good game and make a ton of money, you can talk to Notch if you disagree ;D</p>

<p>no, i think your reason is completely wrong. C++ has always been traditionally fast and Java, traditionally slow and as you’ll know, traditions are rarely removed (look at lisp being regarded as dark wizardry even nowadays) despite the facts suggesting that they should be gone. yeah, java may be a better choice nowadays but the fear of slow, shitty code that was so typical of java a decade ago is still instilled in many programmers and managers minds (knock knock, who’s there, … java). if you search around a bit, i think you’ll find that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the numbers of java programmers compared to c++ programmers aren’t as different as you think, so that point is moot. finally, how much has java been used in industry? not nearly as much as C++. companies rarely want to adopt newer technologies that aren’t as tried and tested as other technologies, which is a huge kick in the balls for java in certain industries.</p>

<p>The point is if someone introduced a project using a language YOU didn’t like personally, you’d fuck them over for it. There’s nothing personally insulting about it, I’m not calling you pig headed or an ignorant prick who doesn’t really have it what it takes.</p>
<p>Who gives a fuck if you know it all, obviously you don’t know it all because there’s no space in that brain of yours for courtesy and respect.</p>
<p>What? Because you are who you are means people can’t speak up about it? Talking about personal insult… giving others crap about using a programming language you don’t like wouldn’t be a personal insult?</p>

for some reason, i don’t think that java will ever grapple the throat of the games industry like C++ did but you have a point that certain projects are increasing the status of java, however, you have to look at minecraft and runescape and how they’re not industry battering in their own right. it’s not like both the games are impressive flaunts of java’s ability (yay, building blocks or yay, training woodcutting). you might have won portions of the indie crowd over because they look for intuitiveness, ease of development and accessibility (applets :D) and not raw ability and performance but the bigger mmo and fps games which require mega amounts of power to be squeezed out of every last inch of the hardware will probably always be written in C++ for as long as it’s popular in industry, even if one day Java can knuckle out the same performance consistently. for java to become highly used in the industry, it’ll need to seriously improve upon what C++ can do.</p>
<p>for laughs, i want you to try and imagine bad company 3 or crysis 2 written in Java.</p>

edit: mendorphins you haven’t read my post properly (dw Davidi2 did the same) and why are you bothering with all those personal insults against me. my ego is super fucking massive get over it<br>
[/quote]<br>
The point is if someone introduced a project using a language YOU didn’t like personally, you’d fuck them over for it. There’s nothing personally insulting about it, I’m not calling you pig headed or an ignorant prick who doesn’t really have it what it takes.</p>
<p>Who gives a fuck if you know it all, obviously you don’t know it all because there’s no space in that brain of yours for courtesy and respect.</p>
<p>What? Because you are who you are means people can’t speak up about it? Talking about personal insult… giving others crap about using a programming language you don’t like wouldn’t be a personal insult?</p>
<p>It makes people not want to be a part of anything because of the likes of you.[/quote]<br>
quit crying, you’ve completely misinterpreted my first post and now you’re just basing whatever you have to say on my personality. i suggest you quit crying and just leave the big boys talk about the big boys topics of discussion.</p>

edit: i agree with ziplock, Java only is just retarded when… being rly honest… Java doesn’t have much of a share in the gaming industry as other languages. you’d be best off just making it generic and letting people use whatever they want, provided it’s not just dumb simple GML or RPGMaker shite<br>
[/quote]I think you’re forgetting Minecraft and Runescape? It’s obvious that Java isn’t a problem when it comes to game design, it’s the fact that people don’t use it enough for it to be a real contender.[/quote]<br>
Javas relatively new also, all the big companies right now started back with c++, and why would they switch now?</p>
<p>Obviously the idea of the forum is to continue with the education of java, as it seems to be the most common on the mopar network, and its the easiest and very powerful. If people make games and then go back to rsps, they will have a whole new perspective on how to accomplish things. Believe me, you learn tons starting from scratch.</p>

<p>Where did I read that no commercial languages/programs are unwelcome because of their incompetence to the big brands?</p>
<p>We should welcome all and see the project for it’s goals and accomplishments, not be narrow minded.</p>

        <p>I can’t believe you’d support something as useless as game maker, the reason it isn’t used by profitable companies is because its very hard to customize and not flexible at all, every game made with game maker will look the same. Obviously if you use game maker you aren’t fit for making games.</p>
<p>Game maker allows you to push out games fairly quickly, and more intelligent people can make some pretty decent original games, but those people should have also switched to a real programming language or else they will hit a roadblock.</p>

<p>What? We’re not proposing it to be a SINGLE LANGUAGE branch of the community. If it would just be in C++ or just be in C# that would defeat the whole purpose of the argument. Knowing multiple languages is a great asset. USING multiple languages is even better. So I don’t see why it should be limited to JUST one language.</p>
