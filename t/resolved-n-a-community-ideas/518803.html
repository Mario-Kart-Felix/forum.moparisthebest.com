<p>Here you go Marchob:</p>
<p>-Quality Poster award (1-2 weeks)<br>
-Helper award (replaces Server helper, is temporary this way people have to constantly keep up helping to keep!)<br>
-Tutorial of the Month - there is no badge/award with this but your tutorial is put up in the news thingy in one of the cycles.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>There should be more staff activity. Just like on a rsps when people don’t see the staff engaging with the community then the players won’t stay. Well it’s the same way with forums. Let’s be honest…the only staff you ever see are ex-staff(david/elvemage), tom, silentcj, and maybe ruby/deathchaos.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>Themes, yes yes I know we all like the basic simple default look that we have but let’s be honest there should be at least one dark theme!</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>Community focused updates: Something I have noticed and I am not entirely sure why this is…but originally when Tom started doing announcements on site updates and stuff everybody really enjoyed/approved of them. The topics were longer and etc. Now though…well they aren’t as actively engaged as they were. Not as much feedback.</p>
<p>If there is one thing I learned from running a server…when you stop getting bug reports/feedback from the players something is horribly wrong!</p>

        <blockquote>-Quality Poster award (1-2 weeks)</blockquote>
Promotes spam, regardless of the rules put into place.
<blockquote>-Helper award (replaces Server helper, is temporary this way people have to constantly keep up helping to keep!)</blockquote>
As a general helper's cup? Refer to the Batman cup, although it is rarely used.
<blockquote>-Tutorial of the Month - there is no badge/award with this but your tutorial is put up in the news thingy in one of the cycles.</blockquote>
Or just have a tutorial nominated for the Featured Tutorials section.
<blockquote>There should be more staff activity.</blockquote>
I've seen plenty of 'staff activity' lately. I'm not sure what you're referring to, but if you mean the staff engaging with the community and taking suggestions, then I'm at a loss of response because that is exactly what [i]has[/i] been happening lately. If you have a quality suggestion, then post it in the very same spot this thread is located.
<blockquote>Themes</blockquote>
Blame my ignorance if I'm wrong, but I've been told that SQL injections are possible with interchangeable themes. Either that, or the admins simply don't find a reason for it.
<blockquote>Community focused updates:</blockquote>
What are you talking about? We've had quite a few quality updates lately, with one of them being the very board that you are posting in; which allows us to provide quality suggestions for the staff to review, and the community to discuss on. If you want to create a community project, then make a thread discussing just that.

        <p><span class="mention">@1</span>, Spam is only produced when rules aren’t enforced. As a former forum manager I have dealt with a lot of spam my ownself before (Ruby can vouch for that xD…) but you know whatfi You deal harsh punishments show them you mean business and you stay in business.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@2</span>, then maybe it’s time the batman cup is used like it is supposed to be used for? Make it temporary though.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@3</span>, The point of having it in the news section at the top is that it proves it is REALLY worth it. All a featured section are the actual literate tutorials.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@4</span>, really? show me 50 posts where a staff member has actually helped in server help (in the past month). They make “important topics” but you never see them be “part of the actual community” if that makes sense lol.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@5</span>, *shrugs and looks at ruby to ask him ? *</p>
<p><span class="mention">@6</span>, <img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/2j68f1x.png" alt width="640" height="480"> fairly large difference in replies on those topics wouldn’t you say? Besides them being locked why do you think that is?</p>

        <p>As I said before, regardless of if rules are strictly enforced, there will always be those select few who post ‘yeah lol’, ‘ikr’, etcetera. To have a reward for post count is just asking for people to build a fake ego and provide a reward for posting. This is a forums, and to communicate on a forums requires you to post. To have a post reward would be giving a reward for the biggest loudmouth.</p>
<p>The Batman cup is rarely rewarded because of how many people actually take the time to provide a serious explanation of an issue and to help a person solve a otherwise really frustrating problem. The server helper cup and batman cup are not on different ‘levels’ of helpfulness, rather the batman cup is known for being a renown overall forums assister.</p>
<p>I see no reason for there to be a ‘Sponsored Tutorial’ and a ‘Featured Tutorials’ section. There are approximately 10 featured tutorials in the Featured Tutorial section last time I checked, and they are all very elaborate and helpful tutorials. To have one tutorial marked as ‘better’ then the others for even a day is preposterous, because Featured Tutorials have to meet very high standards as is.</p>
<p>Show me 50 threads in the past month within the server help section that showed that someone put intelligent thought into their problem and deserved a person to spend as much as 15 minutes trying to guide them through something that they would not learn from. My philosophy for server assistance is that you need to have prior knowledge and have actually attempted to solve your problem before actually posting for help, otherwise you will not learn from the issue and end up just posting the same issue over and over again.</p>
<blockquote>@5, *shrugs and looks at ruby to ask him ? *</blockquote>
Saw it on a forum hacking website somewhere, and I'm not so sure as to how legitimate it truly was.
<p>If you take the time to read through the posts in those topics, it is simply because over time those replies would turn into spam or redirect of a different problem. If you have an issue or have a suggestion (before the introduction of the Community Suggestions board), then you should have private messaged an administrator beforehand. That topic with 1 reply is because it was meaninglessly bumped after ~4 years.</p>

<p>I think you misunderstand the post award. It isn’t for post count itself but the QUALITY of the post.</p>
<p>yes both awards in this day and age mean absolutely nothing quite honestly…hell I rarely even see the server helper actually in server help</p>

<p>with the current set up of server help you are not required to actually “help” but more or less “guide” them to the issue at hand so they can fix. Thus, not a spoonfeeding community which I personally support. If a responder needs to have “experienced the problem before” well … 90% of the threads won’t be answered. Why? Cause the intelligent people don’t use the crap.</p>

        <blockquote>It isn't for post count itself but the QUALITY of the post.</blockquote>
Why would this be necessary? There are plenty of users on this forum who are known for posting legitimate and knowledgable quality responses, and they have nothing under their name to make them stick out. If you want to be known for posting quality replies, then just do that. To have a badge that just creates a false air of superiority and super-saiyan ego is ludicrous.

I stated that wrong. I don't necessarily mean that the poster needs to have experienced the problem in the past, but that the user must at least have prior knowledge. I almost never assist those who have not taken the time to understand the problem at hand, especially when the compiler they are using says 'Variable not found.' At least read the problem that is directly in front of you first. 
<blockquote>the intelligent people don't use the crap</blockquote>
Whose to say that person A is intelligent and person B is just a patient person willing to learn and help as he goes? Plus, with the level of maturity and knowledge of basic grammar within that section, why would the 'intelligent people' go there to help?

As I said earlier, it could simply be a matter discussed upon the staff that we don't know about with a conclusion and reason reached, and that much we don't know. If the administration wishes to allow us to have interchangeable themes, then so be it. If not, oh well. I don't visit these forums for the eye-candy, I visit them so I can post.

<p>Sadly that’s the problem…that’s all the type of stuff you see in server help.</p>
<p>Maybe because they were once in that person’s shoes before? I tell you…you know that nolan guy on here? He posts occasionally. When I first met him in server help a couple of years back he didn’t know squat and now he isn’t the greatest programmer but he does actually attempt stuff.

I assume you have a job, or at least have knowledge of how business administration works. Do the managers invite you to their meetings or always ask for you input? No. They don't need to either; because if everyone had their fair share of opinions here then the place would look like a monopoly game board with My Little Ponies as the background.
<blockquote>Maybe because they were once in that person's shoes before?</blockquote>
And do you know how they got to the point that they are at now? By taking the time to learn.
<blockquote>Hence this thread babe &lt;3</blockquote>
So stop bringing that statement back up, lol.
<blockquote>I never said it had to be a badge  Maybe just a mention in a sticky thread or whatever. The entire point is to help bring back quality activity to the forums.</blockquote>
Why would a person deserve to have their name put into a sticky thread either? That's a waste of quality sticky post space, and to have a spot reserved for the "Elite Poster of the Month" would require a team to look through their posts and spend time that could be spent doing something otherwise more productive for these forums. No, I can't provide an example because I'm not an admin.

        <p>Who says staff have to go into the help sections and help? They are here to keep the forum under control and to take care of important matters when they arise.  There are those who have earned server helper for a reason (and perhaps there are more out there deserving of the badge) and it shouldn’t fall on the staff to go in there and answer questions that have been answered hundreds of times already.</p>

        <p>A huge problem with this community is the fact that so many members do nothing but argue. Sure, you have to discuss things to come to a evaluate something and come to a final decision, but people don’t realize that a lot of things put into a community that makes it stand out are the opinions of everyone, which are very likely to be judged because of an opposing opinion.</p>
<p>In regards to staff activity, I really don’t find it necessary for them to be involved in the community to a social point, although it would be nice to see that. They have duties that they are responsible for handling, even if this duty isn’t always applicable at any given moment, so as long as they are keeping the community clean in terms of rules being followed and enforced, I’m completely fine. Besides, I’ve been here for three years and I’ve only had formal conversations with staff members, or rather conversations relating to rules or something of the similar.</p>

        <p>Actually I do work in a business settings. In any quality field there is a “rotation” process. The managers gain feedback from the regular folks, the managers then meet in a nice air conditioned office sip their coffee etc etc and discuss these ideas normally in a similar type of setting such as a “CIT” meeting and look at the five steps of quality. However, the key point is to actually acknowledge to the employees which ideas were passed which ones weren’t and why not. To further improve the ponc then they have the regular folks to then go back and provide more feedback on how the failed ideas could be improved so that way expectations could be met as much as possible. This is a constant process of course and several ideas will never end but there is still some miscommunication. We are not told what ideas pass, which ideas failed and why, and normally the topic is locked or whatever instead of leaving open so we can help improve upon the idea itself.</p>
<p>And do you know that’s the problem with the server help section? We need some sort of motivator to make them learn. Maybe a spotlight for the few who actually take the time to learn? There would have be securities though to make sure it didn’t get abused.</p>
<p>I think you forgot what the original intent of this line was for babe &lt;3. We were discussing how server help needs to be improved not the ultimatum of how the community hasn’t helped to devalue the sector.</p>
<p>If somebody provides enough quality it will be seen by all. If the staff stay active like they <span class="bbcode-b">should</span> be in the first place then they will notice it and maybe have a hidden thread in their beautiful staff lounge area and discuss that wonderful poster who is providing quality posts with quality subjects. You aren’t thinking properly for some reason today…</p>

<p>Which leads me back to one of my points a lot of those members with that shiny badge stop or do little help afterwards of earning the badge.

Ok, and let's assume that this will work out. Who would be willing to volunteer their own time to help out these people who are willing to learn but don't have the patience to either read the Javadocs or just learn basic Java as is? One of my priorities when guiding a person through an issue is explaining what they could have done better, and giving them hints as to what went wrong.

Having 'server tutors' won't necessarily make the server help section any better. Feel free to private message me ideas though, because then I'd be glad to put it into the J-Program thread if the team agrees with it.

So you're saying that Phaze One should get a shootout just because he made the IRL pics thread? Or should Niall get a thread dedicated just to letting the community know that this poster makes quality posts in the debates section, even though anyone who posts in that board regularly knows that once he replies, the debate gets fired with new ideas? I fail to see a point for someone to be nominated for a 'Quality Poster' rank. I'm still open to talking about it though if you can throw more ideas at me. :P
<blockquote>If a quality poster takes the time to write a topic that is very very hot with active quality posting because of it then it would be leading the herd of horses to the trough.</blockquote>
So if someone creates a very heated and intellectual debate in the debates boards, then they should be awarded simply for knowing how to think and express those thoughts?

<p>My reference was not meant to imply a specific board. When you bring up the concept of quality posts, one can make the connection to the Intellectual Debates and Discussion board, where quality posts are received smoothly and given rebuttal.</p>

        <p>We can have as many suggestions as you can think of, but they are never guaranteed to actually fix anything. Most of these suggestions require the forums to be upgraded which was originally going to be my task, but I literally do not have the time for it (and won’t likely ever). It’s a sad reality, but if we want change, someone who is capable of fixing these forums (other than moparisthebest and myself) needs to step up to do it.
