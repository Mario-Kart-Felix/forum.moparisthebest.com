    <title>In-game NPC text help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/in-game-npc-text-help/94192</link>
    <description>Well, i have been wondering for a while now and never been able to figure it out. How do you make an NPC say something and is there a way to change what they say? and to get them to say like &quot;i 0wnag3 i is offline/online&quot; and &quot;the server owner is i 0wnag3 i&quot; &quot;co owner is...&quot; etc

i wanted to put:
the server owner is i 0wnag3 i
I 0wnag3 I is (online/offline)

Also, its a bit off topic but, how do i take all weather off?

thanks.</description>
