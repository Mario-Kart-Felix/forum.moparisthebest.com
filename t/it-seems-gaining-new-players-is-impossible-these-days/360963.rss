    <description>What the title says. Like what the hell? 2 years ago when I launched my first source ever, an allstar-scape base, and I posted it on the server status page, I gained literally 50-60 players within the hour, and that was without posting it on all of the other sites. Now, I&#39;ve posted my server on 4 different website&#39;s server status pages including this one and for the past 2 weeks my server only averages 5-7 players. Why has it become so hard to gain new players? Like what do you have to do to get more players? And it&#39;s not like there&#39;s hundreds of people logging in then just logging out. I mean barely anyone is ever logging in. What has happened to RSPS?</description>

<p>most of those RSPS players bought some brains and started to make their own servers ; this reduces the amount of RSPS players in 2 ways…</p>

<p>It should though, and that’s why well-made servers don’t get any players. Someone who does less work is getting more than someone else who did more work.</p>

<p>Why pay for a forum software, when you can just get a free one?</p>
<p>Also I remember back in the day when I had a server, I didn’t even advertise it once and I had 50+ online at almost all the time. Now with the server status pages, you have to either have created a server a year ago and put it up or you need to pay 300+ to gain people.</p>

If you want to have a server with a lot of players you’re going to need money to support them. I sure as hell wouldn’t pay for a dedicated server and a variety of other things out of my own pocket if I didn’t have to, would you?</p>
