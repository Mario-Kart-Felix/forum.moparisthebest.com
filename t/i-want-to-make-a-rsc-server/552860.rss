    <title>I want to make a RSC server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-want-to-make-a-rsc-server/552860</link>
    <description>I have a really cool design drawn up in full detail. This server would have a perfect economy and a full wilderness of pkers. I am not a coder so I don&#39;t know where to get started with this. If youre interested in helping point me in the right direction please email me tersch87@gmail. I am a business person and I may be interested in putting in working capital for marketing and coding. 

thanks a lot</description>

              <p>Not to ruin your idea but the RSC community is about 100ish people. From a business standpoint hosting a RSC server is a terrible idea, from what I’ve seen only about 50% of players buy subscriptions which mean you’d make like 250$ a month on your server. Then you would have to factor in server cost, paying a coder, etc etc… I’d suggest RS2 if you wanted to run it from a business standpoint.</p>
