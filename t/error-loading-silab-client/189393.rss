    <description>Error_loader_client - Unable to download client.
silabclient was unable to download the client file 


Login to your computer as an &#39;administator&#39; user, and then try loading silabclient again. This should give it sufficient access to create save client cache file. 


Or, create a new directory called C:\WINDOWS\.silabclient_store_32 or /.silabclient_store_32. If possible, set that directory to have full read+write permissions so that all users can write to it. silabclient should then detect that directory and use it for its files. 


Make sure to accept the java signature it looks like this: 


if the signature does not come up for you, some security software or parental settings may be perventing you from accepting it


Its the error i get, im logged on on an administrator account, and it didnt happen to me till today. Any advice or help on things i can do? Not done with my servers client, and the only desktop of silabs i can find is V4, and it doesnt load some items, so help?</description>
