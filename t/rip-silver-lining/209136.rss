    <title>RIP Silver Lining</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rip-silver-lining/209136</link>
    <description>[url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=58860]Silver Lining[/url] has passed away.

He committed suicide. I don&#39;t know the exact reasons, but he was obviously a troubled kid. Let me say though, I HATE people who fake their deaths, but this is not fake at all. I am being completely truthful and I am [b]not[/b] just making this up with him.

His sister logged into his MSN and was contacting people looking for answers to his death. Naturally we did not believe it due to the large amount of fake deaths that occur here. Mopman asked for their phone number so that we could call, and so we got it. I called the number and asked for Jordan (Silver Lining) and she said this was his sister. She said her mom would like to speak to me about his death. So she went to hand over the phone, and I instantly hung up because I was shocked that this was real. I had a long talk with his sister afterwards on MSN. 

I&#39;m not asking anyone to care, but be nice if you are going to post here. 

RIP

EDIT- Removed obituary due to fucktards spamming the guestbook.</description>

              <p>not to get psychology-like on your butt, However I bet his family, ESPECIALLY his sister are logging on in search for any answers as to why he could have and would have done this.  Why else would his account be logged into? And if you posted on his guest book to his obituary as to what community he was in I am sure they have been here to look for answers. I know that is what I would do if I was part of his family.</p>
