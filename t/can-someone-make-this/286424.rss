    <title>Can someone make this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-make-this/286424</link>
    <description>This script I believe is used to do with the color... Its a script for Puzzle pirates...

Its a gunning bot and i was wondering if anyone was skilled enough to make one
Its rather easy to explain
You have a board and 4 cannons.. to load a cannon ye must first put a red back followed by a white cloth I think followed by a cannon ball... but on pillages and war ect ye need to wash the out with water.. So I was wondering if anyone can make this script to have it start in this order ( Wash it out, red, white,black ) also.. this only loads 3 cannons if someone could be able to fix it and make it do ALL four cannons thanks :) 

The color of water is whitish blue so if its a problem please post :)


If needed.. I can post where ye can download the script as I cannot upload it :/ Maybe it will be easier to edit it then to make it altogether... also.. It says somethings down the bottom.. some hints.. ill post them next time and ask if ye cn help me/ tell me what I need to do :) Thanks!

              <p>Yes the script loads 3 cannons coz it is made to load 3 cannons ive gone thru it and im still in a process to fix it. try not to use it on servers ul b temp banned coz 3 cannon loaders with navy are monitored. i have programming experience but im new to scar, so i have to read alot to understand the already made script. its easy but incomplete il try to complete.<br>
Il try to fix it and post updates here and get some help too. im stuck with dtm presently i need to read more.<br>
