    <description>[b]WesT-LocaL&#39;s Ultimate Autotalker[/b]

Hey, this is av4 but im using the tag WesT-LocaL for my scripts. Ive created an older autotalker and decided it was time to upgrade and learn to use forms and some srl procedures.

[b]Features:[/b]
- Form: For an easy setup, its all very simple.
- Antiban Choice: You can choose to use the spamming and detectable fast talk or the more human like procedures with mistakes etc.
- Uses the F1-F4 keys

Any feedback is welcome

Id like to thank Ejjman and starblaster for ideas i used (but edited myself).</description>
