<p>They certainly have a point, but that does not negate from the stupidity show in the article. Here are some quotes:</p>
<blockquote>If you have Java installed on your system, and you browse to a compromised web site, your computer is immediately infected.</blockquote>
<p>I work with hundreds of compromised websites daily and the above statement is completely false.</p>
<blockquote>Think about it. Java is an old technology that you rarely use in your day to day browsing experience.</blockquote>
<p>I think millions of people will disagree with the sentiment that Java is an old technology.</p>
<blockquote>The problem is that there is a lot of work in keeping all your software up to date. First, you must download the software, then install it, and then most likely reboot. You are looking at 15 minutes minimum. Most people don’t have the 15 minutes, and even more people are unaware that it should be updated</blockquote>
If that is a lot of work, then the poster of this article has no idea what work actually is. It took me 4 minutes to update my Java when Oracle released the update.
<blockquote>So our recommendation is to just remove Java from your system. Even if you visit an old web site that requires Java, you can still install it again. A better idea would be to contact the site administrator and tell them to update to other technologies.</blockquote>
Stupid recommendation, considering he goes on to say you can still install it again. Proper recommendation would be disabling Java until the security problem is fixed. Out of date software should always be updated anyway.
<p>Like I said first, the article is full of dumb statements. They have a point in pointing out the (temporary) insecurity in Java, but that exists in all applications and software at some point.</p>

<p>The Department of Homeland Security recently recommended that everyone disable Java. We at PC Pitstop will go one step further and recommend that everyone uninstall Java immediately. Here is why Java is such a threat to your computer, security, data...</p>
