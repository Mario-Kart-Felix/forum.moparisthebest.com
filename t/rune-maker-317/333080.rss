     [size=12pt] As server progress and become more and more easy to run people lose the intrest in running them as real company. I mean sure its great to have a bunch of friends on a server you run, but why not do it with a little class? Well now my friend Jono and myself are making a server that is run and kept perfect at all times. No more unreliable sources that could shut down at any time without knowing it! We have legal documents to copyright our site and keep Jagex at bay. To see the Pre-View of the site click here: [url=http://www.exite-gaming.net/intro2.swf]Rune Maker Video[/url] Keep watching for when the site and server is released, it will be any day now. Updates will be supplied here when its live.[/size]</description>
