Chronic-X
We stand for quality, we have and always will. We try to minimize the downtime and create a lagg free environment. With all skills fully working and a completely re-designed combat system which is one of the most accurate out there to this day, we are happy to say that our players love Chronic-X. With the daily compliments we get ingame and on the forums, and with the suggestions posted, we keep Chronic-X growing and holding weekly updates.

We guarentee you will:
-Enjoy our new combat system to the max. A Completely re-designed combat system that is one of the most accurate of all private servers.
-Find yourself within an active PKing community.
-Find yourself being able to level all skills. Every skill is fully working (Wilderness Agility as well for example).
-Have an awesome time within our active community and staff.

Server features
We would like to globally name a few of our many attractions, if we were to name them all, the list would be too long! In short:
-Worldwide skilling (And a member skill island)
-Active Pking all around the server
-Plenty of bosses in wilderness and non wilderness
-Advanced Pk point system, the higher wilderness level -&gt; the more points
-Castle Wars
-Double Xp weekends
-::shop area for all your supplies
-::train area for beginner training
-Fight pits for fun dueling
-Safe Pk (dieing and you wont lose anything!)
-Active Wiki for all information
-Gaming to the max
