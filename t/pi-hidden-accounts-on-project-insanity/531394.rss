              <p>I don’t know where you got that information, but it’s wrong.<br>
The only way this would be true, is if you didn’t edit the server enough to remove the old owners work.<br>
Ex:<br>
In commands.java (src&gt;server&gt;model&gt;players&gt;packets) there may be a command like:<br>
if(playerCommand.equals(“spawn”) &amp;&amp; c.playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(“Owner Mark”)){<br>
//Do shit<br>
}</p>
<p>Then anyone with the name “Owner Mark” would be able to use the command spawn, but there’s many ways it could be spelled because you used .“equalsIgnoreCase”<br>
So just go through your files, and make sure that there aren’t any checks for old names, or rights that you don’t use, etc.</p>
