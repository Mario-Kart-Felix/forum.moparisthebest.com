    <title>Auto-save and/or timed event?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/auto-save-and-or-timed-event/43426</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve searched to no avail, and I&#39;m looking for an autosave feature for my server. My server crashes every 10-15 minutes when too many users online. If autosave is not included, that is fine, I would just like a code to make a timed event. Would be nice as well if it could be commented out for future use if I were to use it for other things. Anyways, a reply with a link or an actual TuT would be helpful, thanks!</description>

              <p>Like I said, I have looked for an auto-save and could not find one. You could be a little more helpful by posting the link rather than going on a rant about how everything I did was wrong… once again, I DID use the search feature and could not find it.</p>

              <p>Ok,first,if your server is crashing because of too many people,then go to the tuts section-because someone made a guide on how to limit peopleon your server-so theres less lag,so theres less crashes.For auto-save,someone has also made a tut on how to put it in.</p>
<p>Look in the tuts section.</p>
