    <title>When someone posts a RS2 advertisement... [UPDATED 3/3/10]</title>

    <description>When someone posts a RS2 advertisement, report and ignore. 99.9% of your guys&#39; responses to those topics have been against forum rules. You are breaking rules 2 and 12 when you turn around flaming an advertiser. The advertiser is only at fault for breaking 1 rule, yet you guys manage to break two at once. And since you obviously don&#39;t realize this, I will show you the exact rules you are breaking:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Rule 2:[/b]
Everybody is equal, don&#39;t treat people worse than you do others(E.G., don&#39;t isolate someone and flame them).
[b]Rule 12:[/b]
We respect each other and other communities. We do [b]not[/b] flame. There is to be no fighting on the forums.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And this is the rule they are breaking:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Rule 5:[/b]
Do not advertise without permission from a Global Moderator or an Administrator. Anyone advertising maliciously will be permanently banned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So seriously, quit it. The next time I see this happen, every person at fault will receive an infraction of 1 level higher than the advertiser. If the advertiser gets warned, every replier that flames him will receive a moderation, and so on. Any of you at fault of this are simply bad news for this community. We want positive attitudes, even in the face of those who break the rules. But no, you will no longer get a break simply because the topic op is breaking the rules.

My only piece of advice: report and ignore.</description>
