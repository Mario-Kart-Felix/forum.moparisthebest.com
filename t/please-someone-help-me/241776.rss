              <p>You perhaps should set Java to your CLASSPATH?</p>
<p>I am not too sure how to do it in Vista, but this is how to do it in Windows XP:</p>
<p><code>1. Right-click on your 'My Computer' icon, and select 'Properties'.
2. Once in there, choose the tab 'Advanced' and click on the button 'Environmental Variables'.
3. In the second box of information you see, select the one called 'Path', and click on 'Edit'.
4. At the end of the text already written, append a semicolon ( ; ).
5. You should go to your Java folder (JRE) and copy the path for the bin folder in there.
6. Now, after the semicolon ( ; ), append the path you copied in #5, and save this.</code></p>
