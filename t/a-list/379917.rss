    <description>A self compiled list of possible ways they detect real world trading.


[ul][*]Does the account giving/receiving gold use, or has ever used, a macro program?
[*]If no, are either of the accounts standing friends? 
[*]Do the accounts ISP/IP Addresses associate with that of a third-world gold farming company?
[*]Are there chat logs with conclusive evidence of real-world trading transactions?
[*]If no, do either players have any history of real-world trading?
[*]If no, do either players associate with friends that relate to the above information? (For example, one of the players have a friend who has extensive real-world trading history - Red flag point)
[*]If a player receives a large sum of gold, have either of the players interacted with each other before, or after the initial trade? (I.E Are they friends? Have they given gold before?)
[*]If possible, do logs show the amounts of gold traded before the initial trade? *** If a player shows a pattern of giving away gold to other players, this is an obvious red flag.
[*]Do/Have either accounts shared an IP address with each other?[/ul]

Sure, partyhats, santas, masks, and other holiday items may be watched, but u can’t follow gold. What if 1gp is added? Is that gold now completely different?</p>
<p>And I’m sure RWT use different IP’s for transactions CONSTANTLY. They’d get shutdown rather fast if not.</p>
