    <description>As of right now im trying to find the axe that is closest to the players level and i have no idea how to do that

a simple example would be 4 numbers

10, 15, 25, 35, and the player level is 30

how could i find out a way to analyze the 4 ints and find which is closest to 30

EDIT: since they are in order and you have the axe and the level the last integers returned must be the best axe. 

This is the code.

[code=java]
private static int[][] AXE_DATA = {
			//axeId, axe anim, axe level req, bonus stat
			{1351, 1, 879, 0}, //Bronze
			{1349, 1, 877, 1}, //Iron
			{1353, 6, 875, 2}, //Steel
			{1361, 6,  873, 3}, //Black
			{1355, 21, 871, 4}, //Mithril
			{1357, 31, 869, 5}, //Addy
			{1359, 41, 867, 6}, //Rune
	};


private static void handlePlayerAxe(Client client) {
		for(int i = 0; i &lt; AXE_DATA.length; i++) {
			if(client.getItems().playerHasItem(AXE_DATA[i][0])) {
				if(client.playerLevel[8] &gt;= AXE_DATA[i][1]) {
				axeAnim = AXE_DATA[i][2];
				axeBonus = AXE_DATA[i][3];
				client.playerHasAxe = true;
				}
			}
		}
