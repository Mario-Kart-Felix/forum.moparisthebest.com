    <description>Hello, most of you have notice I&#39;ve been gone for a while. While I can&#39;t lie, I have been a little lazy on my dedication. HOWEVER, I haven&#39;t had a computer until just last weekend for about a month or two. I&#39;ve been in and out on others computers, but it didn&#39;t make much of a difference.

Anyways, I&#39;ve been getting into dubstep a lot lately and have gotten into making some stuff. So far I have this:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa7YM9p-is8

I would appreciate feedback on [b]here[/b]. If you&#39;re going to post on youtube it&#39;s not like I can stop you. However, I will be checking this thread for your specific feedback, not youtube.</description>

<p>one question, at 0:25-0:40, i hear that in alot of other dubstep vids, not saying you copied this, but just a question, is that some kind of signature beat used in dupstep? Because i hear it alot in dupstep, but it sounds really good.<br>
[/quote]No I didn’t copy anything. I’ll check it out though</p>

<p>No, i know that, im just asking is that like a signature beat on dubstep? Because lots of dubstep songs have that type of beat, and its hawt &lt;3.</p>

              <p>[quote=“The Reaper X, post:1, topic:382414”]Hello, most of you have notice I’ve been gone for a while. While I can’t lie, I have been a little lazy on my dedication. HOWEVER, I haven’t had a computer until just last weekend for about a month or two. I’ve been in and out on others computers, but it didn’t make much of a difference.</p>
<p>Anyways, I’ve been getting into dubstep a lot lately and have gotten into making some stuff. So far I have this:</p>

<p>I would appreciate feedback on <span class="bbcode-b">here</span>. If you’re going to post on youtube it’s not like I can stop you. However, I will be checking this thread for your specific feedback, not youtube.[/quote]<br>
interesting combo, reminds me of deadmau5.</p>

              <p>The overall sound was pretty nice. While listening though, there were a few spots where the beats didn’t match up properly for the different sound effects, and I was like “Hmmm…”. Usually those ‘spots’ were only a few seconds. If you need me to I can give you the times of the video were it was like that, because if you fix those it will be perfect.</p>
