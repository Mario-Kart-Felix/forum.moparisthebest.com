    <title>Jump For Joy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jump-for-joy/518696</link>
    <description>&#39;Jump For Joy&#39; is just a small game I recently started working on, mainly for educational purposes.

The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible.
You have to jump from one bar to the other.
The speed the bars move down increases over time.

For the moment you can only play the offline version but there sure will be an online version (1 vs 1) out soon.

Other stuff to be added is a coin system, some obstacles, a better random-barposition generator, smoother jump etc

I&#39;m just getting into game programming, so once again, don&#39;t expect to much of this..

The game is being programmed in vb.net right now but I&#39;m going to convert it to rewrite it in C# and maybe in Java if I have time for it.

              <p>Just had a go at that. That’s incredible. Although some of the jumps are impossible from my point of view. And i dont like how i have to always re-open when i die. There’s also hitting your head on the roof xD but other than that it’s amazing! i couldn’t of produced anything close to this. You say for educational purposes you made it. Was this for college ?</p>
