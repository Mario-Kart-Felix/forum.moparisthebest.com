    <title>[Poll] Rsps Is Boring?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/poll-rsps-is-boring/386330</link>
    <description>Well, everytime I go on a RSPS it bores the hell out of me, and recently programming them or even thinking about them bores me. How do you people feel?</description>

If you have time pm me, I’ll show you a great server made a a member of this community that isn’t leeched, and reminds me of the old times; it’s just more pking based. I play this server whenever I’m done working on Rune Rebirth for the day.</p>

Idea; I sware all the RSPS Programming Gods (Graham, Blake etc.) should go together and make a private server, but not just a Framework, they should fully complete it and publicly host it.<br>
That would be amazing.<br>
[/quote]Haha the Runescape private server programming gods? They aren’t gods, just good at programming because they’re smart and took computer science or a similar degree at college. They only looks like gods in comparison to the rest of this community.</p>
<p>I don’t even like Runescape. I don’t think I could stand playing a private server either. But I enjoy writing private servers because they are a good introduction to game design and networking.[/quote]<br>
They are Gods in my eyes  :o</p>

True!</p>
<p>I find programming a server to be highly unboring. Thinking up  new creative features and learning new things every day? My idea of fun if you ask me. However, it is true most private servers now are all about the same thing… dupe shit, get dclaws, win.</p>

<p>You miss my point; you hardly see any advanced feature development because people don’t know how. If you care to argue that, post some examples of people that don’t know much about how the protocol works that have made advanced features.</p>

<p>And I am posting on what you post as you are a moron who frequently posts incorrect things that I feel the need to correct. That, and the fact that you’ve been a prick to me multiple times in the past.</p>

But it is related to the protocol, it’s about sending items on interfaces, sending configs etc. I guess you could say it’s more about frame methods, but that’s all part of it as well, and is still stuff most people don’t understand. Which was my point</p>
