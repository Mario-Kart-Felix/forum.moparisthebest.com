    <description>Hey guys, i am selling my fully coded server, my hosting and website making. What i will do is host the server, deal with the running of it, coding and webste creation, and the buyer can be the main owner! But why am i doing this? Because i&#39;m over owning a server, i&#39;d like to start with the developing side of things, so this is the perfect way to start for me! I can make a professional website (very professional) and host the server with a virtual private server 6 months paid in advanced. If you are interested add me on skype and we will talk further! nick.brown242. Also after i get paid i would be willing to pay for advertising and i will also advertise the server alot!</description>
