              <p>The color scheme IMO is really great, but I do have to agree with dd123c5 in the fact it does look a little like a blunt object (at least from this angle). All in all looks really good!</p>

              <p>I know because it’s the same for me, we’re comfortable with modelling so it takes us minutes where it might take others an hour. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>From one modeller to another, it seems as though you spent 20 minutes or less on the design and colours to start a thread. Maybe try something harder, new in design or spend as much time as you used to so you can get that end result.[/quote] cx you know me so well. How did you know i made a quick one? 10 minutes actully ^^ but fine ill put more time in my next one.</p>

Not all Greatswords in history have been POINTY! And as for the wire. i Stopped posting mine because its just a waste of time for me. I Keep all my wires very clean. I stopped after i got more advanced with modeling. Just a personal decision really. I just decided to post something. The traffic here isnt like it used to be. And i thought making a POINTY sword was just to cliche. There are tons of historical Swords that were made with Bluntness in mind vs sharpness. And besides it was fun to dabble ^^ just something different i guess.</p>

The coloring is really nice and the sword looks good too , But why is it cut off from the top?<br>
Also please post a wire frame of the sword if you could so we can rate your work properly</p>
