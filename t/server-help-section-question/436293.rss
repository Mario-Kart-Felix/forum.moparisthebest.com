    <title>Server Help Section Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-help-section-question/436293</link>
    <description>I know this is completely irrelevant to a question about server sided content, but I really believe there should be a staff member designated especially for client + server sided RS2 help sections because they are really messy. There are so many duplicate posts and spam that is isn&#39;t funny, so I was wondering if it would be possible to have someone start looking at these sections more, even though the community isn&#39;t as active as in the past.

Thanks, and once again, sorry for this irrelevant post.  :cool:</description>
