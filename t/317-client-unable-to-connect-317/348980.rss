    <title>[317] Client unable to connect? [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-client-unable-to-connect-317/348980</link>
    <description>Hello.

A while back I made a webclient for my server following Halflingsblade&#39;s guide (http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,432152.0.html). I got it to work perfectly with downloading cache and connecting to server and what not. Then I stopped working with my server cause I had to focus more on my school work. Now I&#39;ve started again and I somehow managed to corrupt my client so it didn&#39;t load properly. Instead of trying to find what was wrong and fix it, I just downloaded the clean client again and re-make my client.

This time however, it cannot connect to my server. It loads just fine and downloads cache and unpacks, but it can&#39;t connect to my server (Error connecting to Server, and no message to a connect attempt on my server cmd). This happens on my run.bat file as well, so jarring/singing isn&#39;t the problem. If I change the ip to localhost, it connects, but if I change it to my no-ip ip then it wont connect.

I have not a clue to why this is happening, but I&#39;m sure someone knows how to fix this? 

Thanks in advance  :D</description>

              <p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thank you for pointing out that it might be the port that was the problem  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
I checked it out and the my rsps port was set to wrong ip, probably because router has been accidentally disconnected lol.<br>
Thank you so much, would rep++ if you could  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

Change the port?<br>
Make sure the ip is working?</p>
