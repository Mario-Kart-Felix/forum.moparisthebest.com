    <title>[Subm] Untitled Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/subm-untitled-game/425295</link>
    <description>So, as I mentioned in the announcement topic, I would go and have a shot at it.
My idea is far from finalised, and I&#39;m unsure what I&#39;m gonna do exactly, and how I&#39;m gonna accomplish it.
What I do know is that it&#39;s gonna be a platformer / sidescrolling type of game, and unlike Budda, I do have jumping implemented :)

I&#39;ve worked on a few things so far:
- Input handling
- Screen handling (mostly switching and stuff like that)
- Viewport Scrolling
- Basic collision detection, which, as of yet, isn&#39;t working, mostly due to the way I did the player movement, which is far from ideal
- Dialog boxes (lol)

I&#39;ve been timelapsing most of it, and i&#39;ve got around 300 progress images in the timelapse folder, though I have missed timelapsing quite a bit from last night.
It mostly started out with me trying out a few features in XNA, and I&#39;ve started working on the actual game this week.
My only concern really is the graphics, I suck big time at doing graphics, so I&#39;m unsure what to do about that.

Now for an image which I mostly made as an update for the timelapse.
