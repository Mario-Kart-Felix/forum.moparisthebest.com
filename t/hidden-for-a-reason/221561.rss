    <title>Hidden for a reason</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hidden-for-a-reason/221561</link>
    <description>I was alching [hidden] because I can&#39;t alch slow enough so I go somewheres and alch where there are no people so I don&#39;t get band. People think just because there is an alcher or a theiver that they are the ones massing... So anyways, I was alching there and got banded. I shouldn&#39;t of gotten band just because I was hidden... I accidentaly massed because the server lagged and I got mad... But that is no reason to get band!

[size=10pt]The account that was band was called  &quot;Peanuckle&quot; [/size]
