    <title>Need the author and or title of this book quick!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-the-author-and-or-title-of-this-book-quick/269085</link>
    <description>I&#39;m bored as shit, and I feel like reading again. I&#39;ve got about 2 hours until the library closes, and I want to get a book today. 

So, the book I&#39;m looking for the book that fits the following destription: 

It was part of a series. 
It was a crime thriller. 
The main character was a woman whose family was killed. 
I&#39;ve read the first of the series, and in that book the killer was the main characters shrink. 
IIRC, the writer was quite new in the genre. 
This particular book was written around 2002 - 2005.
The murderer was trained to kill by his father in a basement.
The murders were videotaped.
The main character was part of a team of one other woman, and I believe two men.
The main character kills the murderer, after the murderer shot the other female team member.

I can reproduce a global time line of this book, although it&#39;s been about 2 years ago that I&#39;ve read it. But I can&#39;t remember the title nor the author. I do know that, at the time I read it, there was at least a second book in the series.

I know this description fits a shitload of books, but can you try to help me? I&#39;d appreciate it.</description>
