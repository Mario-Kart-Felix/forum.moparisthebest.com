<p>So, the book I’m looking for the book that fits the following destription:</p>
<p>It was part of a series.<br>
It was a crime thriller.<br>
The main character was a woman whose family was killed.<br>
I’ve read the first of the series, and in that book the killer was the main characters shrink.<br>
IIRC, the writer was quite new in the genre.<br>
This particular book was written around 2002 - 2005.<br>
The murderer was trained to kill by his father in a basement.<br>
The murders were videotaped.<br>
The main character was part of a team of one other woman, and I believe two men.<br>
The main character kills the murderer, after the murderer shot the other female team member.</p>
<p>I can reproduce a global time line of this book, although it’s been about 2 years ago that I’ve read it. But I can’t remember the title nor the author. I do know that, at the time I read it, there was at least a second book in the series.</p>
<p>I know this description fits a shitload of books, but can you try to help me? I’d appreciate it.</p>
