<p>[quote]But why should death really be the end?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You‚Äôre devaluing what we call ‚Äúlife‚Äù. Why would life be oh so important if there is something after it? Pfft.[/quote]</p>
<p>Life doesn‚Äôt become less important if there is an afterlife, just like your meal is no less important if there is brandy and cigars afterward. Yet the question is not on the meaning, or purpose of life, but rather of the continuation of life after the destruction of the physical body. Many people feel that life is not sacred, and does not have value, but this does not affect the afterlife or the perception of the afterlife in a direct way. So a monk may renounce his physical body and fast from all solid foods, but he may still hold a tremendous value in human life, and believe steadfastly in the afterlife, and seek to feed the hungry and clothe the poor. In the same way a progressive humanist may feed the hungry and clothe the poor and hold all human life in high esteem, though they are atheistic and believe in the destruction of the consciousness as well as of the body. Therefore, it does not devalue life to believe in the afterlife, and I would even argue in most cases it increases our appreciation for life.</p>
<blockquote>I have yet to discover what I am, I will briefly describe my feelings towards the subject and you can kindly let me know.
<p>I don‚Äôt believe in god.</p>
<p>The bible was written by a genius or geniuses. Truly a master of manipulation.</p>
<p>The afterlife isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúnew birth‚Äù or ‚Äúsecond chance‚Äù or ‚Äúheaven‚Äù, when you die you come to acceptance with the fact that your time is up and that you took part of what we call ‚Äúlife‚Äù.</p>
<p>Time and life don‚Äôt give a fudge. Life will find a way and time continues to move forward, with or without you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don‚Äôt disagree with your statement that time and life exist in objective reality, since that is self-evident. As far as what you believe, I cannot quarrel with that. I do take issue with the  statement on the authorship of the Bible. With a little research, one finds that the Bible has had many authors, Old and New Testament, and in fact represents only a small portion of the total extant writings on Judaism and Christianity. This canon or collection of books (Bible literally means ‚ÄúBooks‚Äù or ‚ÄúScrolls‚Äù) was collected and bound together to demonstrate the core truths of Monotheism or Yahwism and Christianity. I really don‚Äôt understand your characterization of the authorship as ‚ÄúManipulative‚Äù, and I wish you would explain in more detail.</p>
<p>You can of course trace the origins of Genesis through early Mesopotamian creation myths and Exodus through the oral poetic tradition of Israel etc‚Ä¶The Bible was created by thousands of scribes and authors and poets and speech writers and priests, it‚Äôs not the work of one man trying to manipulate you into believing something.</p>
<blockquote>There is no such thing as "sins". Feel free to do the dirty, in some situations its perfectly fine to kill someone (self defense) and other times you're judged for it? Cmon. Don't give me that nonsense.</blockquote>
<p>The concept of sin, as taught by Jesus, is intensely focused on the heart condition of the individual. If you can lust after your friends wife and not feel bad about yourself, if you can lie for your own benefit and feel fine as long as you don‚Äôt get caught, then that‚Äôs great! But Jesus taught that sin begins in the heart. The New Testament definitively puts to death the idea of legalism, and focuses on the heart condition of men. You can always make ethical arguments against the ‚ÄúAbsolute law of right and wrong‚Äù or the ‚ÄúPerfect justice of God‚Äù, but Jesus had a very simple teaching. Sin begins in the heart, and you reap what you sow. It is empirically evident that men hold themselves to a standard of honor and a code of moral purity which is indwelling in their hearts, and this is what leads to an understanding of sin and separation from the divine, and that they feel wretched and debased when they do not live up to this. As C.S. Lewis put it:</p>
<blockquote>Every one has heard people quarrelling. Sometimes it sounds funny and sometimes it sounds merely unpleasant; but however it sounds, I believe we can learn something very important from listening to the kind of things they say. They say things like this: "How'd you like it if anyone did the same to you?"‚Äî"That's my seat, I was there first"‚Äî"Leave him alone, he isn't doing you any harm"‚Äî "Why should you shove in first?"‚Äî"Give me a bit of your orange, I gave you a bit of mine"‚Äî"Come on, you promised." People say things like that every day, educated people as well as uneducated, and children as well as grown-ups.
<p>Now what interests me about all these remarks is that the man who makes diem is not merely saying that the other man‚Äôs behaviour does not happen to please him. He is appealing to some kind of standard of behaviour which he expects the other man to know about. And the other man very seldom replies: ‚ÄúTo hell with your standard.‚Äù Nearly always he tries to make out that what he has been doing does not really go against the standard, or that if it does there is some special excuse. He pretends there is some special reason in this particular case why the person who took the seat first should not keep it, or that things were quite different when he was given the bit of orange, or that something has turned up which lets him off keeping his promise. It looks, in fact, very much as if both parties had in mind some kind of Law or Rule of fair play or decent behaviour or morality or whatever you like to call it, about which they really agreed. And they have. If they had not, they might, of course, fight like animals, but they could not quarrel in the human sense of the word. Quarrelling means trying to show that the other man is in the wrong. And there would be no sense in trying to do that unless you and he had some sort of agreement as to what Right and Wrong are; just as there would be no sense in saying that a footballer had committed a foul unless there was some agreement about the rules of football.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Life is not a "test", there are no second chances. A second chance simply takes away from value of "life".</blockquote>
<p>There is no claim in Christianity that life is a test, or that the afterlife is a second chance. In fact, focusing on this fallen world as some kind of mortal SAT is a terrible misunderstanding of Christianity, and leads to all manner of confusion. Jesus taught that we are to be a light to this world, a light shining in the darkness. We are to elevate and heal this world as much as possible, not ‚ÄúGet through it‚Äù or ‚ÄúGet passing marks‚Äù. As to your second point, I responded to that at the top of this post.</p>
<blockquote>The sun provides our Earth with a wonderful deadly ray which our Earth has the right material to protect itself from. The sun fuels life, everything grows because of the sun. It causes skin cancer but also grows your fruits and vegetables. Thus we are a form of cancer constantly creating a fresh human so that we can battle the clock.</blockquote>
<p>You are essentially expressing the basic idea of atheistic materialism, which has no answer for the law of Bio-genesis, or of consciousness.  ‚ÄúOmne vivum ex vivo‚Äù ?</p>
<blockquote>Religious people dislike astrology, but yet if you show them the word "god" or "faith" etc etc written using stars, they automatically go ape shit as if its a sign. fudgeing typical.
<p>As for the universe, I think a lot of theories about it are completely wrong and I think with enough time, we can figure it out. We are only at the beginning stage, give it another 10,000 years and I am sure we might know a little bit more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A theory is never claimed to be true. That is why it is a theory. This is the scientific method, of course, which I wholeheartedly believe in. Science never says ‚ÄúWe know for sure that X is Y.‚Äù It says, ‚ÄúOur best method for understanding X is to model it as Y‚Äù. So scientific theories are not ‚ÄúProven Wrong‚Äù they are simply replaced by more accurate models and modes of understanding. It is a pragmatic approach to the universe, not an authoritarian one.</p>
<blockquote>So where does it look like I stand? Is there a name for it? No i am not atheist or a Scientologist. I simply think that people fail to realize that the bible is wrong, science is all fudgeed up and there is a solution if people put their heads together rather than believing something that has already been written and manipulates people.</blockquote>
<p>It seems like you‚Äôre reaching for black and white explanations, but reality is always shades of gray. Some statements in the Bible are historically inaccurate, perhaps simply because of a scribe mis-copying a character or oral tradition going wrong, but whether the entire moral teaching and overall message of the Bible is wrong really depends on the conclusions that you personally are drawing from it. If you read the Bible, and your take-away from it is ‚ÄúI should not eat shell-fish because it is against the Mosaic covenant‚Äù then that doesn‚Äôt make the Bible wrong. If you read the Bible and your take-away is ‚ÄúI should give my money away to the poor because Jesus said so‚Äù that does not make the bible right.</p>
<p>As far as your point on Science being fudgeed up, see above where I address the Scientific method; which provides a <span class="bbcode-b">model and a method</span> not an authoritative answer.</p>
<blockquote>Heres my issue (for some people) : If I ask you right now, "Hey generate a new theory about life, death, god etc" you can't. You have already been manipulated to the point where you're unable to function without a "lead" or a "book" and thus you're fudgeed.</blockquote>
<p>I completely agree. It‚Äôs very scary to see how easily people are manipulated. There are constant assaults on the minds of young people, brainwashing them into accepting mindless consumerism, religious fanaticism, and all manner of unreasonable bullshit. As a seeker of the truth, you always have to be ready to come up with a new theory to explain what you see.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not a Christian because of what I‚Äôve been taught, because of tradition, because of what I read in a book, because of societal pressure. I‚Äôm a Christian because I have had a <span class="bbcode-b">real spiritual experience</span>. I have no trouble saying that if I had been visited by Vishnu and had been told authoritatively by him that Christianity was false, I would believe it, but I have not had that experience, so I do not renounce my faith.</p>
<blockquote>There runs a strange law through the length of human history ‚Äî that men are continually tending to undervalue their environment, to undervalue their happiness, to undervalue themselves. The great sin of mankind, the sin typified by the fall of Adam, is the tendency, not towards pride, but towards this weird and horrible humility.
This is the great fall, the fall by which the fish forgets the sea, the ox forgets the meadow, the clerk forgets the city, every man forgets his environment and, in the fullest and most literal sense, forgets himself. This is the real fall of Adam, and it is a spiritual fall. It is a strange thing that many truly spiritual men, such as General Gordon, have actually spent some hours in speculating upon the precise location of the Garden of Eden. Most probably we are in Eden still. It is only our eyes that have changed.</blockquote>  :|

<p>I am taking what I observe and coming to a conclusion, you on the other hand are reading a book and day dreaming about it. There is no proof for what you have to say, only a book that has been constantly rewritten and changed to keep the manipulated‚Ä¶ well manipulated. But the book/transcripts have not been rewritten, how do you know? Have you gone back and found the original documents and have read the original words? Or do you trust a book and someone telling you that its legit to believe in it.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the same concept with the internet, I don‚Äôt believe everything that is on the internet is correct or ‚Äútrue‚Äù. Yet all this information is posted here. My claim, I don‚Äôt need the internet for. I can simply go outside and observe it. The internet has been constantly updated/revised since its existence. Similar situations.</p>

<p>The bible is not a scientific text. It‚Äôs a spiritual text, about the heart of mankind, it‚Äôs not about quantifying the universe, it‚Äôs about qualifying it. Now there is no real conflict between science and religion. Copernicus proved the earth was the center of the universe, and it wasn‚Äôt really a big deal for the Catholic church at the time. Later, they fought Galileo tooth and nail over his political points, because he wasn‚Äôt afraid to make the political Church (not the true, invisible and universal Church) look stupid. This illustrative of the wider point that you have political dingbats in every religion, in every country, and in every school, who will fight and fuss and turn anything into a bureaucratic nightmare (ever read Kafka?). Science can measure an atom, it can help us to span the stars or conquer mother nature, but in the end it does not give any meaning or nuance to life, and that is what the spiritual pursuits of religion can do.</p>
<p>As far as gender equality, there are no laws in the new testament except the perfect law of love under Jesus Christ. Christians need not accept every word in the Pauline letters as a creed, and they need not even assume that Paul the Apostle is absolutely correct in everything he says, though some churches will push that opinion on to you. The epistles are, rather, an illustration of the early church and an exposition of how a group of people solves their disputes and issues through the grace and acceptance of a benevolent deity. So when Paul speaks of homosexuals burning in sin for one another or women not being allowed to speak in Church, he is talking about specific problems that his community was going through. You can‚Äôt really take these passages out of context and expect all Christians to understand them. Unfortunately many Christians will do just that. They don‚Äôt understand the historical context of what they are reading, and so they cannot perform a proper exegesis on the text and understand what the author was saying and why they were saying it.</p>

<p>I am taking what I observe and coming to a conclusion, you on the other hand are reading a book and day dreaming about it. There is no proof for what you have to say, only a book that has been constantly rewritten and changed to keep the manipulated‚Ä¶ well manipulated. But the book/transcripts have not been rewritten, how do you know? Have you gone back and found the original documents and have read the original words? Or do you trust a book and someone telling you that its legit to believe in it.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the same concept with the internet, I don‚Äôt believe everything that is on the internet is correct or ‚Äútrue‚Äù. Yet all this information is posted here. My claim, I don‚Äôt need the internet for. I can simply go outside and observe it. The internet has been constantly updated/revised since its existence. Similar situations.</p>

<p>I actually agree with you.</p>
<p>I would never ask you to believe anything that is not confirmed by empirical evidence.</p>
<p>So I simply ask you to observe life. From whence did life arise? Life only comes from other life. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that either life is infinite or that the original thesis is wrong and that life must have been formed from something other than life. And, as proven by Louis Pasteur, life cannot come from matter. This means that there is either an infinite life force in the universe, or something other than matter or life exists. Either way, you are left with the inevitable conclusion that God exists.</p>

<p>Do you mean the first life on earth/universe? Then you are wondering how we went from molecules to cells? It took over a billion years for the first rna molecule that could replicate itself. The rest is just natural selection and evolution.</p>
<p>Now when did the first consciousness arrive. This is something we might never understand. Even simple life forms can show signs of anxiety. I tend to assume that our consciousness too is a product of evolution. That there are different levels and scales of consciousness, cognition etc. For humans in particular it was our greatest survival feature.</p>
<p>So again I end up thinking that when we die, it‚Äôll be just like before we were born. Non-existent in all forms.</p>
<p>Enjoy reading your posts as I‚Äôve had my own experiences.<br>
Good night, don‚Äôt let the machine elves bite.</p>
