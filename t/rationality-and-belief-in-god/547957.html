which does not really put a debate forth or anything, however I love the idea of debating the belief in God and the rationality in it… So let’s begin.</p>
<p>First we need to define God. I’m going to use the Western definition of God which is that God is a being who is all-powerful, all-knowing, and morally perfect.<br>
I also need to define two types of rationality… there is an epistemic rationonality and prudential rationality. Epistemic rationality gives the subject good reason to think the belief is true whereas prudential rationality just shows that holding a certain belief maximizes one’s practical interests. We will only be considering epistemic rationality in this argument but I will put forth a prudentially rational argument for the existence of God…</p>
<p>Premise 1: God either exists or he doesn’t exist.<br>
Premise 2: If God doesn’t exist, and we don’t believe in him, we lose nothing.<br>
Premise 3: If God exists, and we don’t believe in him, we lose paradise and gain eternal torment.<br>
Conclusion: Therefore, it’s better to believe that God exists.</p>
<p>We can see that this is a prudentially rational argument as it does not actually prove the existence of God, rather gives you a good reason to believe or act like he does to maximize one’s practical interests.</p>
<p>The second most well-known argument is the design argument which basically states that many complex things we know today did not just come about to exist but have been designed by designers. In that sense we can assume that God must exist as the universe is a complex thing and therefore must have had a designer. The more formal argument goes like this…<br>
Premise 1: The universe is a complex thing.<br>
Premise 2: Complex things have designers.<br>
Conclusion: It’s likely that the universe had a designer.</p>
<p>Now there are three well-known objections to the design argument I will cover.</p>
<p>The first is Hume’s Criticism. Hume says that we can infer that cameras and watches are complex things because we have had previous experience with them and can tell a well-designed watch from a poorly designed watch. However, we have not had any previous experience with the universe so we cannot state if it is or isn’t a complex thing as we cannot tell if it is well-designed or not.</p>
<p>I personally have an objection with the first objection because although we may not have experience with any other universes we can imagine universes that have been constructed poorly. If a universe was created in which the electromagnetic force was a lot weaker than the gravitational force then we would fall through the floor and I would say this is a pretty poor design.</p>
<p>The second criticism is does the conclusion actually show that God exists. God is supposed to be a morally perfect, all-knowing, and all-powerful being. All the design argument shows is that something intelligent created the universe as it just takes something intelligent to design something. This being does not have to be morally perfect and probably not all-knowing and all-powerful to create a universe. Therefore it does not show that necessarily God created the universe.</p>
<p>The third and last criticism is that complex things can arise from non-complex things through evolution. Complex organisms which contain many organic systems and processes have evolved over time from simple single-celled organisms. The driving force behind the creation of these complex organisms is also a simple force known as natural selection so one cannot say that just because something is complex it had to be created or designed.</p>
<p>So let the debate begin for a rational argument for the existence of an all-knowing, morally perfect, all-powerful being. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Define complex.<br>
"Premise 2: Complex things have designers."<br>
Can you prove it?[/quote]<br>
all-powerful - having power over all<br>
all-knowing - knowing everything<br>
moral - concerned with the principles of right and wrong behavior and the goodness or badness of human character<br>
perfect - having all the required or desirable elements, qualities, or characteristics; as good as it is possible to be<br>
complex - consisting of many different and connected parts</p>
<p>I believe that complex things do not need to have designers. That was my argument against it. Some people believe in the design argument and think that just because a complex thing exists that it must have been designed by something. I posted three arguments against why complex things do not support the existence of God.</p>

<p>Pascal’s Wager does not show why it is epistemically rational to believe in God, which is what I stated. It only gives reasons as to why it would be nice to pretend God exists. There’s no justification in it.</p>

"First we need to define God. I’m going to use the Western definition of God which is that God is a being who is all-powerful, all-knowing, and morally perfect."<br>
Your definition is meaningless unless you define all-powerful, all-knowing and morally perfect.</p>
<p>"Premise 1: God either exists or he doesn’t exist."<br>
True, but you need to take into account the different concepts of God.<br>
Premise 2: If God doesn’t exist, and we don’t believe in him, we lose nothing.<br>
What if God only accept those who don’t believe in him? And you lose several things by following a God that doesn’t exist, be it time or money.<br>
Premise 3: If God exists, and we don’t believe in him, we lose paradise and gain eternal torment.<br>
What if God punish people who are foolish enough to believe in him despite the lack of evidence?</p>
<p>"Premise 1: The universe is a complex thing."<br>
Define complex.<br>
"Premise 2: Complex things have designers."<br>
Can you prove it?</p>

all-powerful - having power over all<br>
all-knowing - knowing everything<br>
moral - concerned with the principles of right and wrong behavior and the goodness or badness of human character<br>
perfect - having all the required or desirable elements, qualities, or characteristics; as good as it is possible to be<br>
complex - consisting of many different and connected parts</p>
<p>I believe that complex things do not need to have designers. That was my argument against it. Some people believe in the design argument and think that just because a complex thing exists that it must have been designed by something. I posted three arguments against why complex things do not support the existence of God.</p>

<p>Whoops, guess I read your post wrong. I thought you were arguing something else. I’ve had about five hours of sleep almost every day this past week and I don’t think I function too well. While I don’t think it’s the right reason at all to believe, it certainly is better than nothing. Never mind.</p>

        <p>God is usually referred to as a creator. Anything can be a God.<br>
When it comes to terms, who’s our God? Some people believe in an almighty being, big bang etc.</p>
<p>The subject isn’t a debate on if God exists, it’s more towards a question on how we were created.</p>
<p>Atheists are just people who don’t like not knowing things.</p>

"all-powerful - having power over all"<br>
God can’t be all powerful since he can’t make something that is too heavy for him to lift. You need to make a meaningful definition of all-powerful before you say that God is all powerful.</p>
<p>"all-knowing - knowing everything"<br>
Do he knows the future? And how does he know what will happen in the future?</p>
<p>"moral - concerned with the principles of right and wrong behavior and the goodness or badness of human character"<br>
Right and wrong is a made up concept. Everyone who has some sense of what’s right and wrong is moral according to your definition. You can’t be morally perfect.</p>
<p>"perfect - having all the required or desirable elements, qualities, or characteristics; as good as it is possible to be"<br>
How do you know if something is perfect?</p>

<p>Feelings and thoughts doesn’t radiate any waves. Your body does radiate heat (about 100W), but that doesn’t mean anything. The gravitational forces caused by your body heat is nothing compared to the gravitational forces from your mass.</p>
<p>Just because two things share some of the same properties doesn’t mean it is the same thing. Both ideas and energy can’t be destroyed. That doesn’t mean that ideas share the same properties as energy. You can’t fuel your car with happy thoughts.</p>
<p>We can’t really say that energy exist, just like we can’t say that velocity exists. Potential and kinetic are properties of other objects. A flying cannon ball have energy because it is in a gravitational field and it is moving fast compared to the surface. It doesn’t mean that a cannonball has some inherit energyness.</p>

The belief in aliens isn’t special, it is believing that aliens doesn’t exist that is weird. It would be like thinking our moon was the only moon in the entire universe. There is life here, so why can’t there be life on other planets?</p>
<p>It is difficult to say what kind of life exist out there, but from a statistical viewpoint we are quite average. Some civilizations may think that strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is basis for a system of government, while other have managed to colonize other planets. We wouldn’t expect either to visit us, so we would have to look for them to find them.</p>

<p>Not really. He is using the threat of hell as a logical reason to believe in God. I did the same thing to point out it’s absurdity.</p>
<p>You’re saying we should believe in the flying spaghetti monster?</p>
<p>Last time I checked, you weren’t intimidated/threated by eternal burning and suffering for not believing aliens, with that being a logical reason to believe in them. This isn’t the same context. It’s a big universe and we know the conditions that can support life. That’s why they are searching for places that meet those conditions.</p>

<p>You don’t go to hell if you haven’t heard about Jesus. And yes, many Christians believe you and everyone else deserve to go to hell, it is just God’s love and sacrifice that prevents you from going there.</p>

<p>No matter what religion you follow, another religion will send you to hell. For Christianity, accepting jesus is the only way into heaven. That means jews will not be going to heaven. It pretty much goes to show that all organized religions are total bullshit. Believing god or not is another story that I wont judge people for.</p>

        <p>[quote=“The Wanderer, post:1, topic:547957”]The second most well-known argument is the design argument which basically states that many complex things we know today did not just come about to exist but have been designed by designers. In that sense we can assume that God must exist as the universe is a complex thing and therefore must have had a designer. The more formal argument goes like this…<br>
Premise 1: The universe is a complex thing.<br>
Premise 2: Complex things have designers.<br>
Conclusion: It’s likely that the universe had a designer.</p>
<p>Now there are three well-known objections to the design argument I will cover.</p>
<p>The first is Hume’s Criticism. Hume says that we can infer that cameras and watches are complex things because we have had previous experience with them and can tell a well-designed watch from a poorly designed watch. However, we have not had any previous experience with the universe so we cannot state if it is or isn’t a complex thing as we cannot tell if it is well-designed or not.</p>
<p>I personally have an objection with the first objection because although we may not have experience with any other universes we can imagine universes that have been constructed poorly. If a universe was created in which the electromagnetic force was a lot weaker than the gravitational force then we would fall through the floor and I would say this is a pretty poor design.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s not quite how Hume’s criticism of the watchmaker analogy is usually phrased. The meaning of Hume’s criticism is generally framed as, we know the complexity behind a watch and we know of watches to be man made because we can infer it from previous experiences of watches and of similar experiences with similarly complex items - we know the watch is man made because men make watches and similar things. However, don’t know anything about the complexity (see: 1) of our universe and we have no experiences with any other universe which means, as a result, we cannot infer anything about the complexity or the creation of the universe.</p>
<p>1:  We can know about the complexity of our universe but only in relation to OUR universe. We only know that our universe is complex based on our own experiences within the universe. As you point out, we can imagine a “less complex” (it’s not strictly speaking less complex but you get the picture) universe, and we can imagine a “more complex” universe (lack of heat death, anyone?), but all of this is <span class="bbcode-u">strictly</span> in relation to our universe and <span class="bbcode-u">cannot</span> be used to infer anything about any other universe. This is the gist of Hume’s argument against the watchmaker’s argument - universes cannot be compared to watches (and thus universes cannot be assumed to have a creator) because we can’t infer anything from our universe in relation to anything else.</p>
<p>For your consideration, I’ll leave you with a quote from David Hume on the matter:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.art-bin.com/art/oinqhum2.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">115.</a> But there occurs to me (continued I) with regard to your main topic, a difficulty, which I shall just propose to you without insisting on it; lest it lead into reasonings of too nice and delicate a nature. In a word, I much doubt whether it be possible for a cause to be known only by its effect (as you have all along supposed) or to be of so singular and particular a nature as to have no parallel and no similarity with any other cause or object, that has ever fallen under our observation. It is only when two species of objects are found to be constantly conjoined, that we can infer the one from the other; and were an effect presented, which was entirely singular, and could not be comprehended under any known species, I do not see that we could form any conjecture or inference at all concerning its cause. If experience and observation and analogy be, indeed, the only guides which we can reasonably follow in inferences of this nature; both the effect and cause must bear a similarity and resemblance to other effects and causes, which we know, and which we have found, in many instances, to be conjoined with each other. I leave it to your own reflection to pursue the consequences of this principle. I shall just observe, that, as the antagonists of Epicurus always suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled; your reasonings, upon that supposition, seem, at least, to merit our attention. There is, I own, some difficulty, how we can ever return from the cause to the effect, and, reasoning from our ideas of the former, infer any alteration on the latter, or any addition to it.</p>
