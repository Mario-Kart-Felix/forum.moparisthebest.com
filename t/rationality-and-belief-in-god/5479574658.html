<p>But it does - “god did it” or “god set the plans in motion”, and that’s enough for some people. They’re content with knowing how the universe was created - “god did it” - and they’re content with not needing to know why the universe was created because they shift that burden onto god, followed by “you can’t comprehend god”.</p>
<p>It’s not even Atheists who are the ones who need to know things, it’s scientists, and they don’t even claim to know things, they aim to seek knowledge - to seek understanding, and are constantly trying to disprove their own ideas. It’s as much of a pursuit of knowledge as it is a pursuit of improving ones self and the self of the collective.</p>
<p>P.S. Just FYI, the big bang theory only deals with the formation of the universe in the rapid expansion of space-time, the big bang theory does not cover anything before or the creation of the singularity that eventually expanded (and is still expanding) into the universe that we all know and love.</p>

</aside>
<p>And on this trippy note, there is no “before” the singularity, since time itself didn’t exist. If that’s not hard enough to wrap your head around, the thought of multiple universes kills my thinking power. Since there is no space outside of the universe, where do these multiple universes reside? What direction would you need to travel to them, it couldn’t be x,y,z. We know that the creation of our universe was possible, so there’s nothing to suggest the creation of other universes wouldn’t be possible. What if there’s something even bigger going on from there? (not in the literal sense)</p>

        <p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:11, topic:547957”]"all-powerful - having power over all"<br>
God can’t be all powerful since he can’t make something that is too heavy for him to lift. You need to make a meaningful definition of all-powerful before you say that God is all powerful.</p>
<p>"all-knowing - knowing everything"<br>
Do he knows the future? And how does he know what will happen in the future?</p>
<p>"moral - concerned with the principles of right and wrong behavior and the goodness or badness of human character"<br>
Right and wrong is a made up concept. Everyone who has some sense of what’s right and wrong is moral according to your definition. You can’t be morally perfect.</p>
<p>"perfect - having all the required or desirable elements, qualities, or characteristics; as good as it is possible to be"<br>
How do you know if something is perfect?[/quote]<br>
Perhaps then I’d say all-powerful is being as powerful as we can imagine. That would eliminate any paradoxes such as the one you proposed.</p>
<p>I don’t see any problems with someone knowing the future even if there are multiple futures as you could know all of the future possibilities.</p>
<p>Just for arguments sake say God actually did write the Ten Commandments and passed them onto Moses. These are the tenets according to God to live by. So being morally perfect would be maximizing these tenets in every action God performs. It is hard to know if something is perfect but if you know everything then surely you know what is perfect.</p>
<p>I feel slightly like Euthyphro trying to define a western God to Socrates. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I believe that unlike Socrates you do have a concept of what a western God such as the christian God entails so maybe you could give me the definition I’m seeking for.</p>

I believe in the Law of Attraction, which states everything is made up of energy and energy attracts like things. Your feelings and thoughts send off waves there for by thinking positive and always believing in yourself you can have what ever you want.The images you project in your mind is what manifests in the outer self. By knowing what you want and believing that you can have it, it will come because it will be attracted to you. You ask a scientist what made everything they will say energy. Ask a scientist what energy is made up of he/she will say energy can not be created, can not be destroyed, it is for ever in existence, and could do anything. Ask a priest who made the world he will say god. Ask a priest what is god he will say god can not be created, can not be destroyed, he is for ever in existence, and can do anything. Same definitions…What is everything including yourself made up of? Energy… You are your own god and create your own world.<br>
[/quote]<br>
We can’t really say that energy exist, just like we can’t say that velocity exists. Potential and kinetic are properties of other objects. A flying cannon ball have energy because it is in a gravitational field and it is moving fast compared to the surface. It doesn’t mean that a cannonball has some inherit energyness.[/quote]<br>
Things do have inherit energyness as you stated, it’s called rest energy. A diatomic molecule of oxygen that is vibrating has slightly less mass than two non interacting oxygen molecules because some of that energy is used up in its vibrational kinetic energy. I agree with everything else you said though.</p>
<p>So I pretty much agree with everything that’s being said so far. But is it rational to believe in God for those that do believe in God? I don’t think I can create an argument that says God does not exist because as other’s have stated before we have only been able to explain through science how the expansion of the universe started. We are nowhere close to knowing how space and time itself was created and where the singularity came from (branes anyone?).</p>
<p>I personally believe people can be rational believing in God if that is their choice. I cannot give an argument for the existence of my hand, yet I believe it is rational to believe I do indeed have a hand based on my perceptual experiences. People also claim to have religious experiences that cause them to change their beliefs so therefore I think it is rational for them to believe in a God based on their experiences. The only difference is that I personally do not think it is rational for me to believe in God as I have not had any religious experiences so therefore I do not believe in God.</p>
<p>[quote=“jme, post:26, topic:547957”][quote author=Niall link=topic=666861.msg4463077#msg4463077 date=1418597553]<br>
P.S. Just FYI, the big bang theory only deals with the formation of the universe in the rapid expansion of space-time, the big bang theory does not cover anything before or the creation of the singularity that eventually expanded (and is still expanding) into the universe that we all know and love.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>And on this trippy note, there is no “before” the singularity, since time itself didn’t exist. If that’s not hard enough to wrap your head around, the thought of multiple universes kills my thinking power. Since there is no space outside of the universe, where do these multiple universes reside? What direction would you need to travel to them, it couldn’t be x,y,z. We know that the creation of our universe was possible, so there’s nothing to suggest the creation of other universes wouldn’t be possible. What if there’s something even bigger going on from there? (not in the literal sense)</p>
<p>so fun :D[/quote]<br>
I don’t want to derail this topic but I totally agree with this haha. I cannot encompass how the actual fabric of space and time was created and I wonder if it will ever be understood. Also on the side of multiple universes I believe you would need extra time dimensions. I’ve always wanted to ask a professor, but a lot of people use string theory as a proponent for multiple universes as there could exist multiple dimensions besides the four we experience. However, I think to have multiple universes you would need extra time dimensions rather than extra spatial dimensions. Any event in this universe can be described by a point with coordinates (x,y,z,t) right? Well I think of multiple universes as kinda of being like slideshows. Each slide is a dimension that has those four dimensions (x,y,z,t). In order to travel to the other universe we have to travel in a fifth dimension, say w. However, are we traveling in space or time? In another universe people say I may exist and be a millionaire. I don’t think that in that sense we would be traveling spatially as there are two “me’s”. In order for two me’s to exist I’d have to go to a different time plane. Maybe you’ve read more about this and can enlighten me but it just never made sense that you could just add dimensions and have multiple universes to me. To me you need to add multiple time dimensions.</p>

        <p>I believe we should all at the least be practical with our belief in God. I definitely think religion and science should play out together in an acceptable fashion. I like to think of the phenomena in the universe as a reason to strive and grasp a science-based explanation of things that would otherwise be considered as miracles.</p>

        <p>I guess i’m one of those people who really could care less rather there is a god or there isn’t. Personally i usually stay out of these discussions but why not put my two cents in i’m sure people care right? no well i will explain why i don’t understand how an imaginary being in the sky or universe whatever has the power to create anything then allows his people to kill other people. now i have been told hail fire and brim stone preachers as well as hey god loves us all. He works in his own way.</p>
<p>I don’t believe there is a god nor does anyone else. If they do they are most likely a crazy prophet of some sort. I lost hope in the lord when i use to pray for him to help me. What this imaginary person gave me was a house fire. the death of my grand mother. the death of my dog &amp; cat. then allows my parents to become drug addicts all in 3 years time. So if there is a god he sure as hell doesn’t love my family. So if there was a god he is either irreverent or imaginary. He puts such “good”  where people see angels. or walk into the light and all the rubbish.</p>
<p>If your god loved his people in the bible why would he start a war in the end of days? how human is that just zap satan or who ever into a black hole or something if he is all powerful. remove all the nukes would be a good place to start if he isn’t a magician</p>

        <p>As a whole we are god. We shape everything around us as well as the sun’s gravitational force keeps Earth in rotation around it. Energy in itself can not be created nor destory’d just change forms and if this is true, which I believe it to be so, that same powerful energy that created everything in existence is trying to balance itself out and become whole again; Just like the battery in your laptop is circulating energy through your monitor to release light which is then interpreted by your mind which is powered by what you eat, how much you sleep, and excising your body. The ideas shown by religions are a reflection of ourselves or how we would like to live in our environment to try and shape a better existence but the problem with this was there was many conflicting ideas and the energy be hide those ideas are still trying to balance each other out.

        <p>There are some interesting thoughts here. I love reading Pascal, what was his book, Principes, I think it was called? And Pascals wager is not really an argument for Gods existence, as OP said, it’s simple pragmatism. If doing X is claimed to cause Y, and there is no evidence except tradition, and if  Y were to not occur then it means death, then is there any logical reason to not do X? Why risk (eternal) death? There is a great reason for some; to find truth, even if it means death.</p>
<p>And this is the position of mystics or spiritual seekers. They ask every appariton of the diety to prove themselves; the shaman communes with many Gods, but trusts none of them. Only in death is the final analysis complete for the Hero archetype, he is always seeking. This is why those who have had near death experiences make great shamans. But why should death really be the end?</p>
<p>If religion is the ritual which binds spirituality into culturally appropriate outlets, then Mysticism is the lonesome pursuit of the individual towards union with God. If an individual dies, physics tells us that none of the matter or energy inside of them is destroyed, only trasferred. We don’t know what consciousness is. Science can only describe the patterns of energetic impulses in the brain. Is it so hard to see that the mystic is simply listening to a much larger energetic phenomenon, a bigger pattern.</p>
<p>I’m a Christian, I love Jesus. That doesnt stop me from saying there is alot of truth to Buddhist philosphy, Taoist philosolhy, Suffi mysticism, Hegelian dialectics, and many other religious texts. These are elements of truth, only a part of the revelation. Did you know Jesus said to his People “You are all Gods”? He also said “The eyes are the mirror to the soul”. And he said “If you have seen me, you have seen the Father.”</p>
<p>If you can look at another human with love, you are witness to the very face of God. If you give a drop of water to him that thirsts, you are feeding the Lord of creation. Do you not see that this is truth? That to transcend yourself is to take part in the life divine?</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the hero archetype. Jesus doesnt cheat death to be reincarnated an infinite number of times, like the Hero or Shaman archetype, he conquers it. This is expressed in the Buddha myth; reincarnation is a prison. That is to say, matter is the prison  of consciousness. Escape is only possible through transcendence. This is described perfecly as the Heavenly Bodies of Christian tradition. We are not dissolved into absolute unity, as in the incomplete Buddha myth says, rather we are perfected and completed by union with God, and made into what we always were.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if finding proofs is a good way to understand how religion works, as a model of the universe. God is evidenced, not by his creation, but by his very partners in creation. Each man has a spark of the one true flame.</p>

        <blockquote>But why should death really be the end?</blockquote>
You're devaluing what we call "life". Why would life be oh so important if there is something after it? Pfft.
<p>I have yet to discover what I am, I will briefly describe my feelings towards the subject and you can kindly let me know.</p>
<p>I don’t believe in god.</p>
<p>The bible was written by a genius or geniuses. Truly a master of manipulation.</p>
<p>The afterlife isn’t a “new birth” or “second chance” or “heaven”, when you die you come to acceptance with the fact that your time is up and that you took part of what we call “life”.</p>
<p>Time and life don’t give a fudge. Life will find a way and time continues to move forward, with or without you.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as “sins”. Feel free to do the dirty, in some situations its perfectly fine to kill someone (self defense) and other times you’re judged for it? Cmon. Don’t give me that nonsense.</p>
<p>Life is not a “test”, there are no second chances. A second chance simply takes away from value of “life”.</p>
<p>The sun provides our Earth with a wonderful deadly ray which our Earth has the right material to protect itself from. The sun fuels life, everything grows because of the sun. It causes skin cancer but also grows your fruits and vegetables. Thus we are a form of cancer constantly creating a fresh human so that we can battle the clock.</p>
<p>Religious people dislike astrology, but yet if you show them the word “god” or “faith” etc etc written using stars, they automatically go ape shit as if its a sign. fudgeing typical.</p>
<p>As for the universe, I think a lot of theories about it are completely wrong and I think with enough time, we can figure it out. We are only at the beginning stage, give it another 10,000 years and I am sure we might know a little bit more.</p>
<p>So where does it look like I stand? Is there a name for it? No i am not atheist or a Scientologist. I simply think that people fail to realize that the bible is wrong, science is all fudgeed up and there is a solution if people put their heads together rather than believing something that has already been written and manipulates people.</p>
<p>Heres my issue (for some people) : If I ask you right now, “Hey generate a new theory about life, death, god etc” you can’t. You have already been manipulated to the point where you’re unable to function without a “lead” or a “book” and thus you’re fudgeed.</p>
