              <p>I took AP Computer Science this year and I am a bit disappointed. The tests are completely unrelated to the programming and our teacher’s goal is that we do well on the AP Test (which wouldn’t be bad if we were actually learning a lot of programming). It’s all Java in this class but it has been very helpful for a strong foundation to learn off. Now progress in class is slow and I wish I had some way to learn more faster on the weekend and stuff and just read something for a few hours. I’d rather challenge myself with a few hard programs and learn a lot in the progress instead of doing really easy ones we have to do and getting a good grade. I heard from past students that the next chapters step it up a bit so hopefully I’m ready for the challenge.</p>
<p>May actually take jme’s suggestion and lookup some java docs and stuff.</p>

              <p>Imo highschool programming will just mess you up worse, this must depend on the course and teacher. If they start you with visual basic, the course is just doomed. If you learn java or c# it likely would help you with rsps. But what they teach you in a semester you could have learned in a week with java docs.</p>
<p>I liked our school’s animation course. Learning Maya was the biggest benefit.</p>
<p>But since you are into rsps, gaming, computers and whatever, it would only make sense that you take the course. Surely the other courses don’t seem much more exciting.</p>

              <p>My friend took a course that was titled something similar, they mainly did a lot of 3ds Max and game engines, quite a bit of the Unity engine, ActionScript and JavaScript, mobile design and some basic C++ (asked him what a loop does and he had no idea, so must have been really basic).</p>
<p>Is there not a module overview you can look at?  They normally give you a broad understanding of what you’ll be learning.</p>
