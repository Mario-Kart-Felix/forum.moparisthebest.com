    <title>Penguins win the Stanley Cup</title>

    <description>Pittsburgh Penguins vs. Detroit Red Wings, the penguins took it 2-1. 

Amazing game, the last minute was one of the most intense moments I&#39;ve felt when it comes to Hockey. I love both teams, but I&#39;m glad Pittsburgh won.

Well anyways I&#39;ve been excited for this game all day and I&#39;m wasted as hell. Peace out

Thank god the Pens won (I’m from Pittsburgh so it would kinda suck if we lost to Detroit 2 years in a row).<br>

<p>Penguins are for fanboys.  Everyone jumps on the bandwagon because they have Sidney Crosby.  Detroit killed them last year, and they’re still the better team.  Kudos to the Penguins for actually winning, but Detroit is a much better team.[/quote]<br>
Hey, don’t say I jumped on the Penguins bandwagon.  The fact that I live 20-30 mins outside of Pittsburgh gives me a pass on that.  Crosby isn’t that great either.</p>

<p>I honestly don’t like Sidney Crosby much, I hate how people say “he won the stanley cup.” I like them for a weird reason, they are probably the first team I ever liked a lot, when I was young. So I couldn’t help but still kinda cheer for them. Detriot is a great team though and I love them too. I really thought that in the last 2 seconds they were gonna score I was about to shit myself. OT would have been intense as hell![/quote]<br>
If he won the Stanley Cup, then why did Malkin get MVP?  I would have loved to see Detroit win that game tbh.  The Penguins didn’t do nearly as much as they could.  In Pittsburgh we call that a “Bill Cowher lets run the clock out instead of trying to gain a lead” technique.</p>
