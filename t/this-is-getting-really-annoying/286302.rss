    <title>This is getting really annoying</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-is-getting-really-annoying/286302</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve had to download SCAR like 8 times, and SRL like 5 times because it hasn&#39;t worked every time.

But every script I use has a million errors. I&#39;ve looked at plenty tutorials, and have done each step exactly as said.
Only I get an error instead of it working.

Can someone help me?</description>

Most from this site, the most recent topics.<br>
Mining ones.</p>
<p>But also when I try to get the list of up-to-date includes from SCAR itself, it says “Error while obtaining Includes List!”<br>
Every time I’ve downloaded it, it says that.</p>
<p>I’ve also extracted/downloaded the list of includes that Starblaster posted.<br>
I changed the options on SCAR to get the includes from the file that I extracted the includes to.<br>
Still didn’t work.</p>
<p>The errors are just stuff like certain .txt files are missing.<br>
But that can’t be right because I downloaded them and redirected to that source.<br>
Before, it didn’t register certain coding.</p>
<p>I would just like to get a script that works.<br>
Preferrably Mining/Banking (Ore AND essence. Two different scripts) and magic casting.</p>

<p>Is the script you use a fairly new one? Old scripts don’t work anymore, because they use outdated includes.</p>
