    <description>Ok. this is getting ridiculous now and I;m sorry to waste your time asking these questions.

I recently had to uninstall everything to do with private severs, and now I&#39;ve got them back, the only thing wrong is the JDK working properly. I have installed it into programme files, and into a java folder, and still it says when I compile that I still need to install it? Why? I have it all there  :mad: .

Anyone have any ideas?</description>
