    <description>If I were to send many packets to an IP, would it eventually lag and go down?

Im trying to send packets pretending to ping the IP but I will not recieve them to know if they work.</description>

              <p>Depends on your connection. With just you sending packets to an IP is not most likely going to do anything (not to you, nor your victim, unless your victim has like a 56k connection), but if you have the access to let’s say a hundred PCs, and you ping an ip which has a normal connection (DSL/Cable) the host would probably, if he/she does not have iptables or some other firewall that is set to block almost all incoming connections.</p>
<p>All in all, just you pinging an ip is not doing anything.</p>

              <p>are you talking about sending packets to a private serveR?<br>
if so ask this question at <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a><br>
if your talking about any ip it depends what ip the server is on(i believe, im not an expert).<br>
And also on how big the packets are… if the server is weak and the packets are large im pretty sure you could take it down… but there is 1 in a million chance of that working (btw i could be talking complete bullshit right now, wait for someone else to post i think)</p>
