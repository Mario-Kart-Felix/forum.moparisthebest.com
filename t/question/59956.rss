    <description>ok, i am trying to change the location you are teleported when you die.

i read a tut about it and did what it said but it still teleports people back to varrock when they die.

what i do is go in the client.java and search for youdied.
then a little bit down it show the coords of where you should teleport when you die.
i put the coords in but it doesnt work.
it also sends them to the right place when they die from poison, but not from a player or npc</description>
