    <title>Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question/226405</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t been here in about 6 months. Just wondering what&#39;s been going on? And if Choob isle is still being circulated or not? I realize that people are trying to work with 503&#39;s but I was just wondering.


Thanks,
Adam


EDIT: Wrong section, I&#39;m sorry. If this could be moved to the Questions section, that&#39;d be wonderful.</description>
