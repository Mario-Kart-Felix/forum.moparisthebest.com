    <description>I was just wondering couldn&#39;t you use a long instead of an int for items so you can get much more of em like only 3.4 billion with int but over 4 quadrillion with a long? Does anyone do this or has done this?
also dose not Jagex use a long for storing the high scores because Suomi  is over 4 billion ?</description>

              <p>Yeh, its possible but as Native said you will have to change a lot of packets so the longs would display correctly.</p>
