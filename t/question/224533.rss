    <title>Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question/224533</link>
    <description>I know this isn&#39;t development and what not, but just need something answered for me, and I figured this would be the place to ask.

I&#39;ve heard rumors of JaGex selling RSC? Is this true, and if it is, can someone give me some incite to this please.

If not, then just simply say its not.

No flame required.</description>

<p>How is it?</p>
<p>TBH: I don’t think Jagex would ever sell RSC, even if you offered them a mill or two. If they wanted to make money off of it they could just re-open it purely as pay-only and still make a shit load… Seems like they just want the game to die[/quote]<br>
