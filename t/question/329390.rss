    <title>Question!</title>

    <description>Sorry for people who answers my question 100 times but. Look, i got a router, and 2 laptops and 1 computer uses the router in my house. My question is, will the internet go away - so that i can&#39;t browse - if i put on an static ip? And if it goes away, is it only on my pc or too the other computer and laptop? And the same for portforwarding, will it go away too? And is it easy to fix?</description>
