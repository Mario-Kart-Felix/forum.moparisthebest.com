    <description>How do I make it so whenever I update the client, I want them to download the new one. So what I want it to do is I want to do the ::update *time* command and then once it logs everyone out, when they try to log in with the old client, it says &quot;The *server name* client has been updated! Please download the new client at *forums link*!&quot;, and once they download the new one, they can log in with that.</description>
