    <title>Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question/406562</link>
    <description>Sorry this is just a quick question. I know it says that all bids for a sponsered server spot will be reviewed 10 days before the next month begins. Well it&#39;s now 5 days before August begins and it still says that my server has yet to be read or reviewed and will be done so within 24-48 hours. I was just wondering if it&#39;s just cause you guys are backed up and havn&#39;t gotten to mine yet?

The reason for me asking is because i&#39;m about to be really busy and don&#39;t want my bid to get reviewed while i&#39;m not around to attend to it.</description>
