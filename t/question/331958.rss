    <description>I need to make a rough ePortfolio for some school work, and at the moment I&#39;m using an IFrame to place my .pdf documents in to so they are viewable for the examiner. I&#39;ve now reached a point where I have 32 agendas and minutes of meetings I had which I need to show. Instead of making 32 pages for each of the different documents, is there a way where I can have a single page with a list of all the different documents and when the user clicks on one of the documents, the IFrame will load in the same page, without me having to create a different page for each document.

I hope that makes sense, and please post an easier solutions you may have

Thanks!!</description>

              <p>Just like unhandled said. I did this with a runescape navigator ages ago. Have a page with two frames, one being the link and the other frame the one you want your pdf to be shown in. Then you just have to define the src attribute in alink and it should pop up into to the pdf frame. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Ofcourse this is the simplest way and can be modified to your own needs.</p>

<p>You probably just want to change the src attribute of the iframe when somebody clicks on a link right?</p>
