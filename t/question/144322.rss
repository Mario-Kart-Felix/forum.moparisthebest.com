    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question/144322</link>
    <description>Do you people run your Linux along with your Windows? Like off a flashdrive or a disc? I keep hearing of people running windows along with Linux, they say it&#39;s better that way.

If you do, wouldn&#39;t Linux be VERY slow?

Do you need any more knowledge then windows to use Linux?

I&#39;ve been thinking of turning over to Linux seeing that there are A LOT more better comments coming from that side.

Your comments wont hurt as well ;)</description>

<p>This tutorial will explain how to install <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Ubuntu</a> or <a href="http://www.kubuntu.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Kubuntu</a> or even <a href="http://www.xubuntu.org" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Xubuntu</a> as a dual boot with your Windows Operating System.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What is Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu?</span><br>
Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu are all Linux operating systems. For more information go to their <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">main website</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What is a Dual Boot?</span><br>
A dual boot is when you have more than one operating system on your computer. An example of an operating system (OS) is Microsoft’s Windows XP, Apple’s Mac OS X, and Sun’s Solaris.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">If you do not want to go through the hassle of partitioning and putting the .iso file on a CD, there is hope! Try this, but note, <span class="bbcode-u">this has not been tried by me</span>, so I’m not sure of it’s success rate.</span><br>
To install, all you do is stay on your Windows OS, and then run an EXE file, follow the instructions, and finally install. Reboot, and you can use Ubuntu! Currently in the tutorial, there are dead links that should be pointing to: <a href="http://www.wubi-installer.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.wubi-installer.org/</a><br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">The Following are Required for this Tutorial:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://www.torrentz.ws/torrent/291126/Paragon-Partition-Manager-Pro-8-5-Retail" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Paragon Partition Manager</a> installed on your Windows OS.</li>
<li>You need to have at least 10 GB to spare for this tutorial.</li>
<li>The install CD of your Ubuntu Linux OS. For this tutorial, I used the Ubuntu Live CD and then installed KDE to get Kubuntu. To get that, go to Ubuntu’s <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Main Website</a> and download the correct ISO file!

</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note: There was some confusion earlier on this. When I say 1 GB that is equivalent to 1000 MB, so if they ask you any questions using MB, you will know what to do if I say GB. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The Tutorial</span><br>
So far this has had a 100% success rate! I tried it on both my computers and it worked on a Pentium 4 which is my new one, and my old one which is a Pentium 2. Ubuntu runs pretty fast on both of them! Just follow these steps and everything will work out fine. If you have a question on any of these steps, do not hesitate to ask. If it’s a prominent discrepancy then I will add more information to the step as to not confuse others. Estimated time of completion is about an hour to safely install Ubuntu as a dual boot.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is a very slim chance of anything going wrong, but the slim chance of something bad happening, I will have to ask you to please back up any files that are important on your computer!  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Better safe than sorry. Before I started this tutorial, I saved all important files to my 1 GB USB Memory Stick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download, install, and open Paragon Partition Manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resize your NTFS partition (normally your C:\ drive) by right clicking on it and clicking on Move/Resize partition. Allocate at least 10 GB and then click on Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now to create the Linux partition. At the top, click on Wizards &gt; Create Partition. Click on Next and then click on the unallocated space you created in the last step. Click Next again, and then make sure to format it as Linux ext3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resize the newly created partition and leave about 2 GB unallocated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create another partition out of the 2 GB unallocated and format it as swap. Here is a picture of my partitions. Focus your attention on the bottom 2 partitions in this picture because those are the ones I created to install Ubuntu.<br>
[center]<img src="http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/5274/ronspartitionszk0.png" alt width="" height="">[/center]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After you have finished, click on Apply at the top right. The changes should now take affect. If by any chance it gives an error, then just click on the “Restart” button which will restart and apply the changes on boot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have rebooted or the changes have begun – this may take a while – so make sure to go outside and have some fun or something.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[center]Once it’s finished your computer will be ready for Ubuntu! When it is, continue with this tutorial.[/center]</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Pop in your Live Install CD you made earlier, and reboot once again. Your computer should now load the Live CD. Once it does, select the option to use the Live CD and install. If loading the Live CD does not work, then press F2 when you reboot to enter your boot settings in order to set them to the drive your Live CD is in.</li>
<li>Once the Live CD’s Linux is up, double click on the Install icon on your desktop.  These next few steps are very important.</li>
<li>Follow the installation’s instructions up until the partitioning part!  once you get to this part, set the option to <span class="bbcode-b">manual</span> and click on next.</li>
<li>You will now see your drives, probably 3 or 4. Make sure that formatting your Windows drive <span class="bbcode-b">IS NOT</span> set! <span class="bbcode-b">ONLY</span> check the Linux ext3 formatted drive. Right click on the Linux ext3 drive and select “Edit Partition.”</li>
<li>Make sure the new space in MB is the same as how much you allocated to that drive. Make sure the format is also set to ext3 and set it to mount as “/” (root).</li>
<li>Follow the remaining steps and instructions of the Install and everything will be <span class="bbcode-b">Perfectly Installed</span>!</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone mind telling me in simple language how to multi boot? Do I have to reformat my whole drive(s)? And please don’t link me, I have a job and college and rarely have any time to sit down and read long articles with big words (I’m Russian). Thanks a lot guys <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

No, because virtual machines are horribly slow.  They also have no 3D acceleration.</p>

<p>Ummm, well, it is POSSIBLE to run Windows and Linux concurrently on one computer, but there isn’t much point in doing so. There is also multiboot, which allows you to select which OS you want to start when you boot your computer. In terms of knowledge, yes I would say there are a few things you will need to learn. Learning your way around the terminal in the main one.</p>

<p>Yeah I’ve heard of multibooting, sounds cool. Thanks for the reply <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
