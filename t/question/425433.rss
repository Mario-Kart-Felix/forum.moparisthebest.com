The only thing I can’t decide on is how someone could say that they get to have it instead of someone else. I guess I could say it’s just as much Toms as it is yours, if you know what I mean. I think we should wait and see what MITB has to say.</p>
<p>Tom may consider it hostile whether it’s against the rules or not, so it’s up to you guys if you want to risk it.</p>

              <p>The question is still valid.<br>
Remove Matty form the topic.<br>
Is it against the rules to grief a banned players property?</p>
<p>I would like to think yes and no.<br>
The property <span class="bbcode-u">should</span> become open and “claimable”. and who ever claims it can do what ever they want to it.<br>
In this case we can say Mattys stuff has been claimed and wont be touched.<br>
But it would be good to lay down the rules so there is no further problems in the future. like how to claim a banned property.<br>

<p>And there is a problem with doing that? Just because he isn’t the spreader of peace doesn’t mean you get to grief their property.</p>
<p>PS he’s had traps there for ages, just use your common sense.</p>

<p>Stop being an idiot with all these assumptions, I’ll be online when the server is upgraded to MC 1.0. It’s also only ugly to you and your friends, it isn’t considered ugly to me and you have no right to remove it.</p>
<p>If you touch my bunker I consider it griefing. You’re the one being petty go and play with your own property and not others.</p>
<p>I really hate having to come on threads and defend things like this, just let it be, matty may be banned but it doesn’t mean you get to destroy/do what you want to his property. I also didn’t speak to matty ingame for months and still remained active.</p>
<p>There is no “special link” between me and matty, it’s a flaw in human logic and all in your head.</p>
