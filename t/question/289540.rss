    <description>Asked this before and no one answered...Soooo, giving it a try one more time.

Was wondering how you changed the possible length of character names from 12 to say.....20....On a 317. My friend figured it out client sided, but whenever you talk....You name goes back down to 12 characters. We both think this part is server sided, so I posted here. Any help on where to search and what to search for?</description>
