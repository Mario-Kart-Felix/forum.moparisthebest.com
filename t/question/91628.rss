    <title>Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question/91628</link>
    <description>ok i know i&#39;m a noob and all at hacking and programming. but pretty experience with servers and OS crap. w/e. but when i came here, it looked like these clients such as Aryab (however you spell it) were used so you can get all the stuff you want for RS2 onto your account and then when you go on the real world it would ahve all the money and what not you had before. i mean is that what it is? when i downloaded it and all, it didnt really seem to work that well if at all.

i mean is it possible for at least one of the clients to download the character data of the specified username from runescape.com, then host it on the private server, they do what they need to do, and then have the character data uploaded to the user server at RS.com? i mean, thats what i thought this would be the only point of hacking it all right? idk..i&#39;ve tried more than one route here and either it doesn&#39;t work or i dont understand [i]what[/i] to do.

ya i know there probably was a tutorial. just maybe if i can have an overall description or just where to look specifically on the forums and if thats possible. thanks.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Back in RSC a massive exploit was discovered, which allowed people to basically “create” items. Of course, it was fixed soon, and lots of accounts banned, but still a lot of cloned phats remained. This, however, was because the server didn’t use to check if a certain packet it received was legitimate. A similar exploit, was the one that allowed people to attack banker NPCs.<br>
These exploits, however, are just based on server bugs (failure to check the legitimity of the content of certain packets), and they are very hard to find, especially without a proper packet sniffer / sender tool, and in fact it is well possible that Jagex managed to get rid of all of these exploitable bugs.</p>
<p>Note that a character uploading exploit has close to none chances of existing because the only character uploading is done from the Server to the Database, there is no server packet check that could fail. Besides, even if Jagex was on drugs, and they had overlooked an exploit (which here is kinda impossible anyway) we couldn’t discover it (without actually attacking their servers, which you better don’t do…), as it all takes place behind the scenes. A character uploading exploit is supposed to have existed in Blizzard Entertainment’s Diablo 2, but it’s just a rumour, and it would have been caused by a different reason.</p>
