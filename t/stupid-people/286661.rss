    <description>
Out of all the jobs I&#39;ve worked I&#39;ve never had so many people who just shouldn&#39;t exist.

At Blockbuster, when we close, I&#39;ve had this happen at least ten times. Someone comes up to the door, banging on it, demanding to be let in to watch a movie tonight.

Two nights ago, I had a kid open the little box that you drop movies into and scream his lungs out trying to get in.

Last night, I had this one guy top all of them off. Him (looking about 19 or 20) and two kids (both 10) were chilling leaning against their car outside. It was 9:01 (we close at 9:00) and I was locking the front door and this other guy had JUST walked in and I was like okay we&#39;re closed so if you have any last minute decisions I&#39;ll help you make them and he&#39;s like okay I&#39;ll leave and I was like no man you can stay I was just saying. So I go up to the front and start trading this guy&#39;s games in for him and I turn around and see one of the 10 year olds kicking the door and the other guy moving his mouth a lot with his hands in the air, so I say hold on and go to the door. I told the little kid he can&#39;t do that and that we&#39;re closed and the guy is like &quot;DUDE I TOLD MY MOM I&#39;D GET HER A MOVIE AND IF I COME BACK WITHOUT ONE SHE&#39;LL BE SUPER PISSED&quot; and I&#39;m like &quot;okay cool, we&#39;re closed&quot;. And he&#39;s like &quot;let me in I&#39;ll tip you&quot; and I say &quot;I am not opening this door for anyone.&quot; Then he says he&#39;ll come in through the exit door which isn&#39;t locked yet and I told him I&#39;d call the cops. So he asks if someone can get him a movie and he&#39;ll pay them on the way out and I say I am not pushing anything onto my customers and he&#39;s out of luck, we close at 9 every night but Friday and Sunday and then we close at 11, and we open at 10 everyday so he can come sometime then. I finish helping the last customers and he&#39;s still out there waiting and he calls the store and the kid I was working with picked up and after a little while he was like &quot;Sorry we&#39;re closed&quot; and hung up.

So later when I was counting the drawers the phone rings and I pick it up and it&#39;s that guy and he&#39;s like &quot;I just wanted to let you know that the punk kid on your staff with the color in his hair will no longer have his job by tomorrow, I used to manage a Blockbuster for three years and I know the staff at your store pretty well so let him know&quot; and he hung up.

I was so tempted to own that faggot, because he was forced to pick up a movie for his mom and looked no older than me, no way any of that could be true. 

But seriously. At least once a week or two some fool is banging on the doors, continuously calling, or trying to slip money under the door.

Then I realized, that doesn&#39;t really happen anywhere else, at least where I&#39;ve worked.

ITT: stupid people at your jobs.</description>

He’s a bartender… I didn’t think his job description was going into washrooms to find people shooting up heroin.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>If he finds someone doing that, he’ll have call the cops/tell the manager. It’s not just his ass that’s on the line, it’s the clubs ass too. They have to make sure noone does drugs inside their building.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thats right. If the licensing know that we are letting druggies in and allowing them to take drugs on our premises, They will revoke our license and my place will be shut down.</p>
<p>Its not Herion. its mainly Coke and other Powdered drugs. Sometimes you go up to check em and people have left most of the line on the top of the toilet. Ive Also found Pills on the floor at the end when were are clearing up.</p>
<p>Cant Stand drug takers. Especially when they bring drugs on our door. A members only club. Knowing fine well theres shit loads of signs up saying we will hand you into the police blah blah. And also knowing we can get shut down for it. And they still do it anyway. Fuck em. They deserve everything they get. There just selfish bastards who only think about themselves and there only little fix.</p>

I get alot of underage People coming into the club i work at. I ask them for ID and they say they have just shown the bouncers, No matter how much i explain to them that the bouncers are different then Barstaff They will wont budge. So i go get the bouncers and they say “No we havent checked there ID”, So they get kicked out.</p>
<p>Next you get the people Wrecked out there head, banging into people. Falling over chairs, And then expecting to get somethin like a double JD and coke. No way.</p>
<p>And finally. you get the people taking drugs in the toilets. When you catch them they kick off at you. its like, Mate You know its illegal, You know theres a high chance you get caught, You know you will get Barred from here, You also know that you will be put on Pubwatch (Meaning your barred from all the pubs and shops in the area) And also that you will be handed over to the cops. Yet you still chose to be stupid and do it on the premises.</p>
<p>Some people are so stupid in my area :@ There also filming some stupid BBC3 Program in my area atm to.<br>

Whoa snitch. You’d call the cops for catching them do drugs??[/quote]<br>
Of course he would, if he didn’t he’d be putting his job on the line for some stupid druggy, you’ve obviously never had a position of responsibility.</p>
<p>Although I myself do drugs, I’m not retarded enough to do them at a pub or club, I do them beforehand then go.</p>

              <p>Same. I also worked in a department store, as a grocery associate. We closed at 9, but never got to leave until about 10 pm each night because of last minute shoppers.</p>
<p>I can understand coming in at 8:55 because you need a bag of chips or a case of pop. But people would do their entire week’s shopping right at closing time.</p>
<p>And srt8 I know what you mean when they make it seem like your fault. I recently had a job where I had to go door to door selling dog and cat tags, as it’s a by-law in my city that every year you need to buy a tag for your pets, and have them registered with the city. Really it’s just a money grabber (the tags cost 50 cents for the city to buy, and they charge people 30 dollars for them), but people would yell at me and call me a fucking idiot etc, because I’m just doing my job. I just told them to contact animal control if they have a problem with it. But people would lie, scream, and cry at you because they have to pay 30 dollars for their dog. Sometimes I would tell them in the nicest way I could, don’t own a dog if you can’t afford it.</p>
