        <p>Out of all the jobs I’ve worked I’ve never had so many people who just shouldn’t exist.</p>
<p>At Blockbuster, when we close, I’ve had this happen at least ten times. Someone comes up to the door, banging on it, demanding to be let in to watch a movie tonight.</p>
<p>Two nights ago, I had a kid open the little box that you drop movies into and scream his lungs out trying to get in.</p>
<p>Last night, I had this one guy top all of them off. Him (looking about 19 or 20) and two kids (both 10) were chilling leaning against their car outside. It was 9:01 (we close at 9:00) and I was locking the front door and this other guy had JUST walked in and I was like okay we’re closed so if you have any last minute decisions I’ll help you make them and he’s like okay I’ll leave and I was like no man you can stay I was just saying. So I go up to the front and start trading this guy’s games in for him and I turn around and see one of the 10 year olds kicking the door and the other guy moving his mouth a lot with his hands in the air, so I say hold on and go to the door. I told the little kid he can’t do that and that we’re closed and the guy is like “DUDE I TOLD MY MOM I’D GET HER A MOVIE AND IF I COME BACK WITHOUT ONE SHE’LL BE SUPER PISSED” and I’m like “okay cool, we’re closed”. And he’s like “let me in I’ll tip you” and I say “I am not opening this door for anyone.” Then he says he’ll come in through the exit door which isn’t locked yet and I told him I’d call the cops. So he asks if someone can get him a movie and he’ll pay them on the way out and I say I am not pushing anything onto my customers and he’s out of luck, we close at 9 every night but Friday and Sunday and then we close at 11, and we open at 10 everyday so he can come sometime then. I finish helping the last customers and he’s still out there waiting and he calls the store and the kid I was working with picked up and after a little while he was like “Sorry we’re closed” and hung up.</p>
<p>So later when I was counting the drawers the phone rings and I pick it up and it’s that guy and he’s like “I just wanted to let you know that the punk kid on your staff with the color in his hair will no longer have his job by tomorrow, I used to manage a Blockbuster for three years and I know the staff at your store pretty well so let him know” and he hung up.</p>
<p>I was so tempted to own that faggot, because he was forced to pick up a movie for his mom and looked no older than me, no way any of that could be true.</p>
<p>But seriously. At least once a week or two some fool is banging on the doors, continuously calling, or trying to slip money under the door.</p>
<p>Then I realized, that doesn’t really happen anywhere else, at least where I’ve worked.</p>
<p>ITT: stupid people at your jobs.</p>

        <p>When I was a debt collector at National City Mortgage, I spoke to idiots on a daily basis. The best ones were when someone would be behind on their mortgage or starting foreclosure and they would start screaming at me asking why I was taking their house. They just couldn’t believe I was actually going to foreclose and take their homes. Finally I lost it and was like, “Yes sir, I’m personally putting you in Foreclosure and then I’m going to Texas to take your home from you and live in it.”</p>
<p>I felt bad for these people, but they got themselves in that mess.</p>

<p>And this one chick man.</p>
<p>There’s this summer pass right, for $15 ($5 more than what you’re paying for two movies) you can swap those two movies as many times as you want for free in the period of 7 days. The first swap gets you one free movie, and every swap after that gets you two more for free. Mainly for people that have a not-so-busy week or people who play games (the pass is cheaper than two game rentals, saving much more money in the long run).</p>
<p>So this chick has two movies right, and just brought two back, obviously a candidate, and I see her a lot in there. She also had one tiny candy item for &gt;$2.</p>
<p>So she says yes to the pass and I’m like you’re total is $17. She’s like wait what. I’m like candy, pass, tax. She’s like but one is free because on the Rewards (which she’s also on) is rent one get one free Mon-Wed. I’m like yeah, but you didn’t pay for either movie, you payed for the pass, therefore there’s none free. She’s like so it’s $10? No. It’s $17. You said yes to the pass which is $15, and you got the candy yourself. Either way, rent one get one free is only good for older movies, and you have two new movies. So she says she doesn’t have enough money (she has a credit card) and wants me to take the pass off and she’ll swap one movie for an older one.</p>
<p>So she leaves to find an older movie. Passes, aren’t really cancelable. You can cancel it, but it doesn’t cancel until the last day, from then on it ceases to exist. So even though it’s considered cancelled, it’s still on her account and any movie is going to go onto that and be free until the pass finally cancels.</p>
<p>So… I have to take one movie off the pass, find the cost of the original movie and candy, and do a negative credit so it’s not all free for her.</p>
<p>She comes back with an older movie and then wants to take the candy off and get another candy. Actually, she wants two ice creams, a drink, and another type of candy.</p>
<p>In the end, she ended up paying $5 for a movie, $8 on candy, totaling at $14 something. On top of that, every movie for the rest of the week will still be free for her, though we’ll have to negative credit for her to pay for them.</p>
<p>All for $3 which she “didn’t have.”</p>
<p>What a bitch. I hate the ones that agree to the shit and then go back on it, causes a shitstorm.</p>
<p>That reminds me of another story, of this old bitch. I sold her Rewards ($10 for a year, one free movie every month, rent 5 get 1 free, and rent one get one free Mon-Wed). That time and another time she got a free one each time, earning her her $10 back.</p>
<p>But she came back super pissed and said she didn’t want the program and didn’t mean to pay $10 extra for it. I explained she got two free movies, earning her the cost of the program back, and from then one for the next 11 months she’d just be getting free movies with no cost to them. She still wanted her money back.</p>
<p>What the fuck.</p>

        <p>When I worked as a bagger and then a cashier at meijers (a grocery / general merchandise store, like wal-mart) we had that exact same problem when we closed, but much worse.  The store is open 24 hours a day, 364 days a year, we closed at 7pm on christmas eve and there was always the poor saps pounding on the doors and windows, or trying to sneak in the exit doors because they needed that last christmas present.  They either didn’t realise or more likely didn’t care that everyone in there has families they want to get back to on christmas eve, so most of the time we never got out of there until 10pm or later.</p>

        <p>Same. I also worked in a department store, as a grocery associate. We closed at 9, but never got to leave until about 10 pm each night because of last minute shoppers.</p>
<p>I can understand coming in at 8:55 because you need a bag of chips or a case of pop. But people would do their entire week’s shopping right at closing time.</p>
<p>And srt8 I know what you mean when they make it seem like your fault. I recently had a job where I had to go door to door selling dog and cat tags, as it’s a by-law in my city that every year you need to buy a tag for your pets, and have them registered with the city. Really it’s just a money grabber (the tags cost 50 cents for the city to buy, and they charge people 30 dollars for them), but people would yell at me and call me a fucking idiot etc, because I’m just doing my job. I just told them to contact animal control if they have a problem with it. But people would lie, scream, and cry at you because they have to pay 30 dollars for their dog. Sometimes I would tell them in the nicest way I could, don’t own a dog if you can’t afford it.</p>
