    <title>Need some clarification</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-clarification/315956</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t really touched RS2 development for years now, but I remember it wasn&#39;t very far when I first ran a private server.. there was only Dummy training and item spawning, lol

Anyway, is there any servers available that use SQL management for things like files and save data? Have they come that far yet?

And what client/server number or whatever was it before the GE-type shit came out? Before all the trade balancing and that corny shit.

Thanks</description>

<p>Anybody else have any suggestions on a good all around server? It’s pretty mind boggling that after 2-3 years of being away from the RS2 Private server scene that they all pretty much still suck, or maybe it’s just coincidence that the first 5-6 servers I tried out are pretty bugged :[/quote]It’s hard to find a good source to use as most of them are shit no matter what client version you use. I think learning java more and making a server yourself for either 317, 508, 525 or 562(or 564, forget which one.) as they are the most popular at the moment.</p>

              <p>Does it really matter what client version had the trading limit and the Grand Exchange, it doesn’t affect your server because you don’t have to put in the Grand Exchange and remove PKing and “that shit”. Also there is SQL loading and saving, read the tutorial sections or use the search button. Thanks.</p>
