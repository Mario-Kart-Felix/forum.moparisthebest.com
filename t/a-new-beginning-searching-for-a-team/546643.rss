    <title>A New Beginning - Searching for a Team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-new-beginning-searching-for-a-team/546643</link>
    <description>Hello all,

I am looking to start up a server. I am currently searching for a team that will be in itself, successful and willing to work to achieve a goal.

I will be paying for a website, webhosting, and a vps once everything is settled in (Not right off the bat). I have a little knowledge in Java, but not enough to run a successful server on my own.

That is where you come in... I&#39;m looking for a team to help me out and be active.


The base and everything will be discussed within the team itself, once we get a few team members together.


You can contact me through skype at - &quot;Garrett3650&quot; if interested</description>
