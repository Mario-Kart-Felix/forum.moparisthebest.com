    <title>Help with compile issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-compile-issue/553230</link>
    <description>I read through a bunch of stuff about the compiler and certain things you have to change in them in order for them to get the correct path, I did all of those correctly. Now I have a problem where it says:

&quot;Note: client.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.&quot;


Which I read won&#39;t do anything or impact the compile, the problem I am having is nothing I am editing is going through. I tried giving myself owner powers and adding donator points to my account and they haven&#39;t gone through. I would really appreciate any help, I am new and trying to learn. It sucks being stuck on something that is probably very simple.

Thank you in advance</description>

Are there multiple variables for donator points? If so, make sure it’s the correct one. If that’s not the case, make sure that you are indeed adding the points (for instance if you have an if statement beforehand, print out to make sure that it is true.)</p>
<p>As for giving yourself owner, this shouldn’t be an issue with compiling unless you’re not editing the character files to change the rights.</p>
