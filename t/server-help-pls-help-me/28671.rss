Difficulty: 1<br>
Assumed Knowledge: Being able to follow instructions and search websites<br>
Server Base: All</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>Step 1<br>
Before you do anything you will need the latest edition of Java JDK.<br>
You can find this download HERE [glow=yellow,2,300]<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp%5B/glow%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp[/glow]</a><br>
Code:<br>
JDK 5.0 Update 9<br>
The Java SE Development Kit (JDK) includes:<br>
* the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)<br>
* command-line development tools, such as compilers and debuggers, that are necessary or useful for developing applets and applications<br>
Once you have found the download accept the license agreement then choose wat installation method you would prefer.</p>
<p>Code:<br>
Windows Platform - J2SE™ Development Kit 5.0 Update 9<br>
Windows Offline Installation, Multi-language ---------------------------------------- jdk-1_5_0_09-windows-i586-p.exe ---------- 49.56 MB<br>
Windows Online Installation (typical download size is ~33.7MB), Multi-language ------ jdk-1_5_0_09-windows-i586-p-iftw.exe ----- 245.76 KBNote: I suggest online installation</p>
<hr>
<p>Note: You should now have Java JDK Update 9 installed and ready to use. If not please go back to the beginning of step 1</p>
<hr>
<p>Step 2<br>
Now before we download a server, first we need a suitable program to modify the server.<br>
Here are my recommendations (FREE)</p>
<p>Notepad - This if the default program that most will have. Rating: 1/10<br>
TextPad - TextPad® 4.7.3 is a powerful, general purpose editor for plain text files. Easy to use, with all the features a power user requires. Rating: 8/10</p>
<h2>[glow=yellow,2,300]<a href="http://www.textpad.com/%5B/glow%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.textpad.com/[/glow]</a> USE THIS</h2>
<p>Note: You should now have Java JDK Update 9 installed and ready to use. If not please go back to the beginning of step 1<br>
Note: You should now have a suitable program for editing .java files. If not please go back to the beginning of step 2</p>
<hr>
<p>Step 3<br>
Now we have all the things we need to run a simple server, So let’s download one!<br>
Here are my recommendations (FREE)</p>
<p>TestScape - A simple source.   Great for beginners [glow=yellow,2,300]<a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=VC3TV8XY%5B/glow%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=VC3TV8XY[/glow]</a><br>
CheezScape 80 - The latest cheezscape source. Great for intermediate coders  [glow=yellow,2,300]<a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=8MF4EQBL%5B/glow%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=8MF4EQBL[/glow]</a><br>
Project 16 Version 6 Edit 7 -  An updated Project 16. Great for advanced coders  [glow=yellow,2,300]<a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7DO6EFY7%5B/glow%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7DO6EFY7[/glow]</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Note: You should now have Java JDK Update 9 installed and ready to use. If not please go back to the beginning of step 1<br>
Note: You should now have a suitable program for editing .java files. If not please go back to the beginning of step 2<br>
Note: You should now have a suitable server downloaded. If not please go back to the beginning of step 3</p>
<hr>
<p>Step 4<br>
So now we have a server and all the things we need to modify it. But before that, we need a program to open the file because most servers will be zipped into a .rar archive<br>
Here are my recommendations (FREE)</p>
<p>WinRAR archiver - a powerful tool to process RAR and ZIP files   [glow=yellow,2,300]<a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7DO6EFY7%5B/glow%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7DO6EFY7[/glow]</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Note: You should now have Java JDK Update 9 installed and ready to use. If not please go back to the beginning of step 1<br>
Note: You should now have a suitable program for editing .java files. If not please go back to the beginning of step 2<br>
Note: You should now have a suitable server downloaded. If not please go back to the beginning of step 3<br>
Note: You should now have a suitable program to extract .zip and .rar files. If not please go back to the beginning of step 4</p>
<hr>
<p>Step 5<br>
So now you have a server extracted and ready to use. But when you start it you get a weird error.</p>
<p>Can Not Find Specified Location<br>
Device is not ready<br>
javac is not reconized<br>
To fix this we need to edit two files.</p>
<p>Edit Compile.bat and replace the text inside it with:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@echo</a> off<br>
title yourservernamehere<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_09\bin\javac.exe” -cp . *.java<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_09\bin\java.exe” server<br>
pause<br>
Edit Runserver.bat and replace the text inside it with:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@echo</a> off<br>
title yourservernamehere<br>
java -Xmx1024m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.17-ga-bin.jar server</p>
<hr>
<p>Note: You should now have Java JDK Update 9 installed and ready to use. If not please go back to the beginning of step 1<br>
Note: You should now have a suitable program for editing .java files. If not please go back to the beginning of step 2<br>

Note: You should now have a server that compiles correctly. If not please go back to the beginning of step 5</p>
<hr>
<p>Step 6<br>
So your server should be up and running. Want to test it?<br>
Well open up [glow=yellow,2,300]<a href="http://www.MoparScape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">www.MoparScape.org</a>[/glow] and log-in to your internal IP.<br>
Note: This is either localhost or 127.0.0.1<br>
Note: Username and password can be anything you want.</p>

<hr>
<p>Step 7<br>
Step 7 is split into two parts.</p>
<p>A - Setting up No-Ip<br>
B - Setting up Hamachi</p>
<p>Step 7 - A<br>
First go to the No-Ip site and click [glow=yellow,2,300]<a href="http://www.no-ip.com/newUser.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.no-ip.com/newUser.php</a> [/glow] then register an account.<br>
Note: While registering for an account they send you a confirmation email<br>
Now once you have registered download the [glow,yellow,2,300]<a href="http://www.no-ip.com/downloads.php?page=win%5B/glow%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.no-ip.com/downloads.php?page=win[/glow]</a> and install it.<br>
Now open the program and enter the e-mail address and password you used when you signed up.<br>
Now go back to the No-Ip website and login.<br>
Once logged in click Hosts / Redirects then Add<br>
For the hostname type your servers name. For example MyFirstServerScape and then choose an ending of your choice. For example no-ip.info anc click the create host button.<br>
Now all you need to do is open up the [glow=yellow,2,300]<a href="http://www.no-ip.com/downloads.php?page=win%5B/glow%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.no-ip.com/downloads.php?page=win[/glow]</a> and right click then click Refresh Host List</p>
<p>Step 7 - B<br>
First download [glow=yellow,2,300]www.Hamachi.cc [/glow] and then run the program and it should provide a small tutorial on how to use the program.</p>

<hr>
<p>Step 8<br>
Note: This step is only for users with Windows Xp Service Pack 2<br>
Now we need to set windows firewall exceptions for the port that most people use to access private servers.<br>
Go to Start -&gt; Control Panel and then click Open Security Center then click Windows Firewall Which is at the bottom of the Security Center. Once the windows firewall page has come up click on the exceptions tab. Then lcick “Add Port” and Name the Port as your server and put the port # as 43594. Then click Ok.</p>

<p>Step 9<br>
Now all we need to do now is set port forwarding. As every router is different i cannot give you direct instructions. The best i can do is give you a site dedicated to helping you port forward.<br>
The site is: Port Forward [glow=yellow,2,300] <a href="http://www.portforward.com/%5B/glow%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.portforward.com/[/glow]</a><br>
