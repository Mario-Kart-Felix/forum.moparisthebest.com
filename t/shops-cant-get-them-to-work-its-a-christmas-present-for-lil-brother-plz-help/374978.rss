    <description>My little bro played a rsps for a while and got good at it, and he got scammed, hacked, duped, juped, pooped, you get the point! and i wanted to make him a rsps for christmas! i want have it done, by chrsitmas but a b&#39;day presnet would be nice for him! So i have this problem! I have a shop and it works fine but he doesnt sell anything! i&#39;ve tried to sell like buckets, swords, sheild, armour, phats and it doesnt work!
Grrrr stupid... shop error, (well its not working so i think its an error) Its driving me crazy!
 :mad: :mad: :mad:
Any this is what i have..... all i want is a shop that has phats.. its that simple. Yet its as hard as pullin a rabit out your ass!
Alli  want is the rare shop to work. 940 is an unique code and isnt bewing used! and 556 isnt a npc that is being used either!                                                                 
} else if (NPCID == 553) { //Aubury rune shop
					PutNPCCoords = true;
					WanneShop = 2; //Aubury Magic Shop
                                                                } else if (NPCID == 556) {
	                                                                PutNPCCords = true;
	                                                                WanneShop = 940;
                                                                } else if (NPCID == 554) { //Gilded Shop
					PutNPCCoords = true;
					WanneShop = 48; //Gilded Shop            

This is in Shops.cfg ( the &#39;shop =&#39; bit that usally goes in front of the shop code, make the run source going ape %$@!

940             Rare_shop          2	2	1048	100	1050	100	1038	100	1040	100	1042	100	1044	100	1046	100

and auto spawn! He spawns fine, you can trade him its just nothing appears! Ive used about 5 different codes! None work!

spawn = 556	3233	3215	0	0	0	0	0	1

Plz help me~!~!@!~!~!!~!1`~!!~!!!~!`1 (BTW im using Blanc or Blank client and Source + theres a god damn tool that comes with it called, Shopmakerv1.exe by jaywalker and it is simple and u hit in the data you want such as items + price, x and y, and npc etc. It generates the codes and you copy and paste into the correct location! And that doesnt work either. + i have watched 20+ videos, and tutorials on how to do it! BRRRRRRRRR help me and ill be very very very hjappy

<p>replace all those items with the items you wish to have in the shop the first number is what item you want and the second is how many of that item</p>
