    <title>My objects are totally screwed up?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-objects-are-totally-screwed-up/386101</link>
    <description>I added primals to my server.
The primals work.
But the primals replaced my object id somehow?
Because I used to have a wooden fence around my skilling area.
But now its floating primal armor?
Is the model just screwed up?
Is it not compatible with my client?
Can I fix it or do I have to delete the primal models?</description>
