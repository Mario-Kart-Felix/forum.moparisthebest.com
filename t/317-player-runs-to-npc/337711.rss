    <title>317 Player runs to NPC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-player-runs-to-npc/337711</link>
    <description>Whenever a player is attacking an NPC, and then does a teleport command ie &quot;::home&quot;, they will start to run through walls towards the direction the NPC was in. Can someone please help me with this. All it has to be is just taking some code out or modifying it? Correct?</description>
