    <title>Another one of those tough riddles</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/another-one-of-those-tough-riddles/95684</link>
    <description>I have seen people posting riddles but this one is the hardest I think. And it&#39;s not as easy as it sounds. Have fun  :)

Riddle:
If the man had seen the saw dust, he wouldn&#39;t have died.

Answer: The man died because he killed himself. He did it because he held a record for the shortest man in the world. A man cut his cain but because he was blind he thought he grew so he had no reason to live.

Hints:

1.He was blind (this is almost 1/2 the answer)
2.He had a cain.
3.He had a record for being the worlds shortest man (basicly the other 1/4)
4.He committed suicide
5.He was miss led</description>

              <p>Since the man was poor he had to live in an alley, and alleys are full of rats. Rats = bye bye cheese. The man had a poor education, thats why hes poor, so he couldnt realize that the rats were eating his cheese. Everytime he went back to the same alley with cheese, the rats ate it. He went days without eating, and eventually died.</p>
<p>But wouldnt he die of dehydration first?</p>

              <p>[quote=“nator123123, post:355, topic:69145”]Now for nicodk, and for some sense for everyone:<br>
There are many meanings to operate. Riddles, just need common sense. To operate. The doctor cannot operate his son, because he is injured. The doctor cannot operate his son, because he is dead. The doctor cannot operate his son, because he is too lazy. The doctor cannot operate his son, because it wasn’t his son. The doctor cannot operate his son, because the head doctor can only operate on certain spots, such as the head. Riddles are made for challenging the brain, therefor it can have millions, and millions of answers. You can bring that to the common riddle, ‘Why did the chicken cross the road?’. There is billions, maybe even googles of answers. Riddles are to tease the brain, in my thought, it makes the teller of the riddle feel good, as for he can make millions of answers for the riddle, and his pray has chances and chances, and if the teller is not the good riddle-teller kind, he can switch the answer over and over again. Riddles are just for fun, and they should stay that way.</p>
<p>You may not understand much or anything I have said, because everything you think of at first turns into a ‘maybe’ or an ‘about’.<br>
Also because maybe you are not understanding which type I’m using.<br>
ex for ‘The doctor cannot operate his son, because he is injured’.<br>
As I have told you, there are many meanings to operate, and in that current sentence I’m using the ‘Operating the boy’ as in ‘Operating the machine’.<br>
It can be hard to understand things.</p>
<p>Then on, Riddles Rock![/quote]<br>
