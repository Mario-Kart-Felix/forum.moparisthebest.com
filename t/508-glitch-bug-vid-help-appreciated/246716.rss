    [b]OTHER THINGS I WOULD LIKE HELP WITH!!![/b]


1. NPC&#39;s at home, if you ever played Dustscape 508, i would like npc&#39;s like the watchtower wizard at home to convert magics and the combat instructor, or a chef to give you free food

2. Vegence, when i click vegence or any other lunar spell nothing happens, would like veng and veng other fixed

3. ::yell to be added

4. Chaos ele to be added, i previously added but it had no hp, i added it to npc list but didn&#39;t understand the coding.

5. A coder to help me throughout my project,

6. Skillcape emotes randomly stopped working, i didn&#39;t edit any of the coding to do with this, it just stopped, would like this fixed.

7. Bounty Hunter loot symbol system, would like the bounty hunter skull to tell how much a player has on them to appear whislt in bounty hunter.

8. A membership system, meaning... alot of npc&#39;s in the server, all with drops, however, i would like member&#39;s only to be able to get certain drops and ::item to be removed

9. Training xp to be lowered, When using ::train you teleport the the TzHaar place shown on my vid, it takes around 5 hit&#39;s to 99 strengh etc. would like this lowered.

10. Godwars boss&#39;s to use more than 1 kind of attack and to be aggressive, along with their &quot;minions&quot;

11. Dark bow and Rune c&#39;bow to be fixed, as shown in the attached video you do not actually range with these items...

12. If help number 8 cannot be fixed then for certain items to only be obtained by doing certain things eg. Bandos Chestplate cannot be spawned; obtain this item by killing General Graardor. Same with gs&#39;s and whips, ddp&#39;s etc

13. Npc&#39;s not to drop even when you die, this is shown in the vid, found this Bazaar??

14. Sometimes when you teleport into the wilderness you will have an item deleted, would like this fixed.

15. NPC&#39;s to spawn slower, as shown in vid the npc&#39;s spawn instantly.

16. Another command such as ::starter which gives around 1m 100 noted lobsters and shortbow, rune scim, iron scim, monk robes, etc

[b]WILL POST MORE WHEN FOUND AND WILL STRIKE THE FIXED NUMBERS, ONCE AGAIN, THANKS FOR YOUR TIME (:[/b]</description>
