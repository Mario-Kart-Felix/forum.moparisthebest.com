    <description>Hey guys, i am just posting about this server because we would enjoy having ALL of you guys join us! This is a HUGE server with MANY different things to do! From pvping to rpging! From owning a town to shopping at trade town! We have 4 different servers fitted for all different types of people! 

Main builder server: play.savagerealms.net 
A little bit about this server: The main build server has towny, classes, and even an auction! There are portals to different worlds, we have PvP world (not the PvP server), RPG world (Not the RPG server), and build world! Main build has the most worlds fitted for all people. 

RPG server: rpg.savagerealms.net
A little bit about this server: This server is quite similar to the main build server but doesn&#39;t base itself on building, it is based on doing quests and beating dungeons! Get more money to buy more items! Live in a town if you&#39;d like! But if you decide not to live in a town, you could get stolen from! 

PvP server: pvp.savagerealms.net
A little bit about this server: This server is COMPLETELY based around PvP! PvP is on everywhere except for spawn! This server has factions! Create the biggest faction and rule them all! But before you can do that, you have to get to know people or have some friends come on with you because people will raid/destroy/take over your base if you are not well hidden or powerful enough! 

Survival games server: go to www.sr-sg.net to find out which server is available. (The I.P.&#39;s are 1.sr-sg.net to 10.sr-sg.net)
A little bit about these servers: The survival games are a LOT of fun! The plugins were all created by the people from savage realms! When the game starts, run to the chests to get food/weapons/ and even leather armor! Kill everyone in the game to win! When you kill people or win, you get silver coins, change the silver into gold and buy a new class! But always be watching your back or using your compass to find nearby players!
