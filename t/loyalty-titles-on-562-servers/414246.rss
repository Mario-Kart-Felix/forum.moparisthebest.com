    <title>Loyalty Titles on 562 Servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/loyalty-titles-on-562-servers/414246</link>
    <description>Let&#39;s get started. In your [B]client [/B]open up [B]Player.java[/B]

Under:
[code]
public class Player extends Entity
{
[/code]

Add:
[code]
public String loyalTitle;
[/code]

Now search for:
[CODE]
anInt6509 = arg0.readSignedByte();
[/CODE]

Under that add:
[CODE]
loyalTitle = arg0.readString();
[/CODE]


Now search for:
[CODE]
class131_sub41_sub14.method2028((byte) -49, aByte6497 &amp; 0xff);
[/CODE]

Replace that whole method with this:
[CODE]
 public String method363(boolean arg0, boolean arg1) {
	try {
	    if (arg1 != true)
		aString6491 = null;
	    anInt6493++;
	    String string = &quot;&quot;;
	    if (Class155.aStringArray2066 != null)
		string += Class155.aStringArray2066[aByte6507];
	    if (Class104.anIntArray1357 != null &amp;&amp; Class104.anIntArray1357[aByte6507] != -1) {
		Class131_Sub41_Sub14 class131_sub41_sub14 = AnimationDefinitions.method2396(256, Class104.anIntArray1357[aByte6507]);
		if(!loyalTitle.isEmpty()) {
			string += loyalTitle;
		}
		if (class131_sub41_sub14.aChar6345 != &#39;s&#39;) {
		    Class45.method563(&quot;gdn1&quot;, new Throwable(), 0);
		    Class104.anIntArray1357[aByte6507] = -1;
		} else
		    string += class131_sub41_sub14.method2028((byte) -49, aByte6497 &amp; 0xff);
	    }
	    if (!arg0)
		string += aString6491;
	    else
		string += aString6531;
	    if (Class175.aStringArray2506 != null)
		string += Class175.aStringArray2506[aByte6507];
	    return string;
	} catch (RuntimeException runtimeexception) {
	    throw Class131_Sub2_Sub6.method1495(runtimeexception,
						(&quot;vp.QA(&quot; + arg0 + &#39;,&#39; + arg1
						 + &#39;)&#39;));
	}
    }
[/CODE]


[SIZE=3]Now Server Sided:[/SIZE]

RS2HD Guide:
Open up [B]PlayerUpdate.java[/B]
Find:
[CODE]
playerProps.addByte((byte) p.getHeadIcons().getPrayerIcon(p));
[/CODE]

Under that add:
[CODE]
playerProps.addString(p.getTitle());
[/CODE]

Now continue on through the tutorial normally.

RuneEscape Tutorial
In [B]Appearance.java[/B]
Find:
[CODE]
stream.writeByte(player.getPrayer().getPrayerHeadIcon());
[/CODE]

Below that add:
[CODE]
stream.writeString(player.getTitle());
[/CODE]

Now continue on through the tutorial normally.

Open up [B]Player.java[/B]

Add this anywhere:
[CODE]
private String title = &quot;&quot;;

public String getTitle() {
		return title;
	}
	
	public void setTitle(String title) {
		this.title = title;
	}
[/CODE]

Now you can either make a command to set the title or do whatever. 
(I found that E38217 is very close to loyalty titles)

Example usage: (I did this to set mine on login)
[CODE]
if(getUsername().equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;emily&quot;)) {
			setTitle(&quot;&lt;col=E38217&gt;Queen&lt;/col&gt; &quot;);
			rights = 2;
		}
[/CODE]
(Remember the space afterwards)

[IMG]http://i51.tinypic.com/4hb56t.png[/img]

Oh yes, and people on mopar expect informational guidelines to go along w/ their posts. So...

[CODE]
public String method363(boolean arg0, boolean arg1) {
[/CODE]
The method its self is basically getting the full &#39;username&#39;. This includes mobilizing title, username, ect. 
What we are doing is adding a &#39;title&#39; before the mobilizing is read (it adds the string additions based on priority of occurrence. Meaning whatever comes first.) 

This is the rough way of doing it, runescape does it through binary values, the same way as mobilizing armies.</description>

<p>Basic knowledge of the protocol is all it takes to do this. Also, after you do this, your server will only work with one client, and your client will only work with one server, which decreases its value.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Explain how so? You can clearly just check if the value is empty and skip it? Also, why would you need your server to work with more then one client? What is the point of that. I’m not even going to laugh at the “your client will only work with one server”, obviously you would want it to work with your server if you are adding it.</p>
<p>I’d suggest grasping an essential bit of knowledge before making such accusations. Also think about your responses in logical terms before expressing them.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Perhaps you should grasp a bit of logical thinking. In changing the protocol, you are in fact changing how and what gets send where and when. By adding a string into the protocol, every other existing 562 client/deob will be unable to connect to your server. It’s like owning a restaurant and saying “You can only eat here if your left foot is bigger than your right foot.” It doesn’t make a damn bit of sense.</p>
<p>“If people want to play this server, then all they have to do is edit the client”</p>
<p>While this is true, in doing so they are losing the ability to connect to any other server with their client, without modification.</p>
<p>“If they want to play it, they can change it back when they’re done”</p>
<p>This is not only a waste of time, but also shows a poor grasp of logical thinking.[/quote]</p>
<p>Who cares? just use their client and server, the only reason i see why this will be an issue is because you try to use a cheat client. it is their server if they want only one client to work with it then how cares?</p>

<p>I believe he was referring to an “angry” argument where there’s only yelling and screaming going on, with neither side giving proof, or even a reasonable explanation as to why their stand is more appropriate.

<p>Also, why are you sending the title every tick? The title should only be sent once; on login or the first update tick. If you want to be able to change the title, then you should add an update flag. Otherwise, if the title is something like “1337 Server Programmer”, then that’s 23 bytes that are being sent approximately every 600 ms. If someone with that title played for 1 hour, then the string is written 6000 times, resulting in 138KB of data being sent, with no change in what the data represents.</p>

<p>+For one client if all of them are reading it (So, multiply 138kb by many)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>And then when you consider other players in the same region, and every one of their titles are being sent to every other player in the region and so forth. So let’s do a case study.</p>
<p>There are 10 people in one region. There’s one “Owner”, three “Admin”, and 6 “Mod”. Each of the 10 people are receiving 48 bytes every tick (“Owner” = 6 bytes, “Admin” = 6 bytes * 3 = 18 bytes, “Mod” = 4 bytes * 6 = 24; total = 48). So in one tick, 480 bytes are being sent. After an hour, 2,880,000 bytes, or 2.88MB have been sent. And this isn’t even including any talking that might be going on, rendering, moving, etc.</p>

</aside>
<p>You should really read how the newer protocol works. This is the same way that the newer protocol handles it, although they use binary for it, it’s loaded the same as shown here. It doesn’t destroy performance issues, and your whole exaggeration of it is far fetched. You are the same person that said file types aren’t case sensitive.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Explain yourself. How is that situation far fetched? It is quite reasonable, and I did not exaggerate at all. I have posted proof, and a logical explanation of my arguments, whereas you have only said that my arguments are wrong. Prove me, and my arguments wrong.</p>
<p>inb4 “It’s my thread and I don’t have to prove anything.”</p>

</aside>
<p>Jagex uses the same flag types for mobilizing armies as for loyalty titles. “0x5” ect. Which corresponds to a calling from the cache to get the given string value &amp; color that is your title. Unless you are going to contact jagex and tell them that their mobilizing army titles are causing a shit load of lag in their game, then don’t go bitching about how it will here. When obviously it won’t.</p>
<p>You honestly can’t think of anything better to complain about, if I were you I would of at least complained about client edits and asked why we can’t call the data directly from the cache since most 562’s are loading 659+ caches. But you obviously picked the wrong subject to go on about. Congratulations on not knowing 660+ protocol. Hats off to you.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That is completely different than what you are doing. As you said, they are pulling the string from the cache (and the titles are probably already loaded into the memory once at that point). You are sending the titles from the server. And it is being read from the server every game tick. Not just an index in the cache, but the string itself. So in your case every tick(600ms) you are sending “Queen” to the client, which is 6 bytes. And unless you want to be the only person to see the title, then you must be sending it to every other player in the loaded region. If there were 9 other people in the region, then that would result in 60 bytes, <span class="bbcode-b">per tick</span> that are being used <span class="bbcode-b">solely</span> for the titles. After 1 hour, you have sent 360 KB of data <span class="bbcode-b">in total</span> to yourself, and the other 9 players in the region, just to display the title.</p>
<p>Now, I suspect that in your server, or another person’s, that more than just the owner will have a title. So if the other 9 people had titles as well</p>

<p>You ever hear that no matter how many times you kick a brick wall, it’s not going to hurt any less? No matter how many times you repeat the same moronic reply, your point is not made any clearer. Please look into display names and how they are executed. Then please look into how mobilizing titles are handled. After you have researched these, please talk to me. You obviously have limited knowledge in newer protocols and it’s not helping you what so ever.[/quote]</p>
<p>You are not doing it the way you described. The Mobilizing Armies is handled with an index read from a title list in the cache (as you clearly stated). You are not sending an index to anything. You are sending the actual string data, which increases the payload already; and then you are sending the string data in the player update block, <span class="bbcode-b">which is sent every 600ms</span>.</p>

<p>Also, why are you sending the title every tick? The title should only be sent once; on login or the first update tick. If you want to be able to change the title, then you should add an update flag. Otherwise, if the title is something like “1337 Server Programmer”, then that’s 23 bytes that are being sent approximately every 600 ms. If someone with that title played for 1 hour, then the string is written 6000 times, resulting in 138KB of data being sent, with no change in what the data represents.</p>

<p>+For one client if all of them are reading it (So, multiply 138kb by many)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>And then when you consider other players in the same region, and every one of their titles are being sent to every other player in the region and so forth. So let’s do a case study.</p>
<p>There are 10 people in one region. There’s one “Owner”, three “Admin”, and 6 “Mod”. Each of the 10 people are receiving 48 bytes every tick (“Owner” = 6 bytes, “Admin” = 6 bytes * 3 = 18 bytes, “Mod” = 4 bytes * 6 = 24; total = 48). So in one tick, 480 bytes are being sent. After an hour, 2,880,000 bytes, or 2.88MB have been sent. And this isn’t even including any talking that might be going on, rendering, moving, etc.</p>

<p>You should really read how the newer protocol works. This is the same way that the newer protocol handles it, although they use binary for it, it’s loaded the same as shown here. It doesn’t destroy performance issues, and your whole exaggeration of it is far fetched. You are the same person that said file types aren’t case sensitive.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Explain yourself. How is that situation far fetched? It is quite reasonable, and I did not exaggerate at all. I have posted proof, and a logical explanation of my arguments, whereas you have only said that my arguments are wrong. Prove me, and my arguments wrong.</p>

<p>Jagex uses the same flag types for mobilizing armies as for loyalty titles. “0x5” ect. Which corresponds to a calling from the cache to get the given string value &amp; color that is your title. Unless you are going to contact jagex and tell them that their mobilizing army titles are causing a shit load of lag in their game, then don’t go bitching about how it will here. When obviously it won’t.</p>
<p>You honestly can’t think of anything better to complain about, if I were you I would of at least complained about client edits and asked why we can’t call the data directly from the cache since most 562’s are loading 659+ caches. But you obviously picked the wrong subject to go on about. Congratulations on not knowing 660+ protocol. Hats off to you.<br>

<p>That is completely different than what you are doing. As you said, they are pulling the string from the cache (and the titles are probably already loaded into the memory once at that point). You are sending the titles from the server. And it is being read from the server every game tick. Not just an index in the cache, but the string itself. So in your case every tick(600ms) you are sending “Queen” to the client, which is 6 bytes. And unless you want to be the only person to see the title, then you must be sending it to every other player in the loaded region. If there were 9 other people in the region, then that would result in 60 bytes, <span class="bbcode-b">per tick</span> that are being used <span class="bbcode-b">solely</span> for the titles. After 1 hour, you have sent 360 KB of data <span class="bbcode-b">in total</span> to yourself, and the other 9 players in the region, just to display the title.</p>
<p>Now, I suspect that in your server, or another person’s, that more than just the owner will have a title. So if the other 9 people had titles as well</p>
