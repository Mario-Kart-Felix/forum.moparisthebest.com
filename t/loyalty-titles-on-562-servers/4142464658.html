<p>Jagex uses the same flag types for mobilizing armies as for loyalty titles. “0x5” ect. Which corresponds to a calling from the cache to get the given string value &amp; color that is your title. Unless you are going to contact jagex and tell them that their mobilizing army titles are causing a shit load of lag in their game, then don’t go bitching about how it will here. When obviously it won’t.</p>
<p>You honestly can’t think of anything better to complain about, if I were you I would of at least complained about client edits and asked why we can’t call the data directly from the cache since most 562’s are loading 659+ caches. But you obviously picked the wrong subject to go on about. Congratulations on not knowing 660+ protocol. Hats off to you.</p>

<p>That is completely different than what you are doing. As you said, they are pulling the string from the cache (and the titles are probably already loaded into the memory once at that point). You are sending the titles from the server. And it is being read from the server every game tick. Not just an index in the cache, but the string itself. So in your case every tick(600ms) you are sending “Queen” to the client, which is 6 bytes. And unless you want to be the only person to see the title, then you must be sending it to every other player in the loaded region. If there were 9 other people in the region, then that would result in 60 bytes, <span class="bbcode-b">per tick</span> that are being used <span class="bbcode-b">solely</span> for the titles. After 1 hour, you have sent 360 KB of data <span class="bbcode-b">in total</span> to yourself, and the other 9 players in the region, just to display the title.</p>
<p>Now, I suspect that in your server, or another person’s, that more than just the owner will have a title. So if the other 9 people had titles as well</p>
<blockquote>There are 10 people in one region. There's one "Owner", three "Admin", and 6 "Mod". Each of the 10 people are receiving 48 bytes every tick ("Owner" = 6 bytes, "Admin" = 6 bytes * 3 = 18 bytes, "Mod" = 4 bytes * 6 = 24; total = 48). So in one tick, 480 bytes are being sent.

<p>Jagex uses the same flag types for mobilizing armies as for loyalty titles. “0x5” ect. Which corresponds to a calling from the cache to get the given string value &amp; color that is your title.

<p>You honestly can’t think of anything better to complain about, if I were you I would of at least complained about client edits and asked why we can’t call the data directly from the cache since most 562’s are loading 659+ caches.

<p>That is completely different than what you are doing. As you said, they are pulling the string from the cache (and the titles are probably already loaded into the memory once at that point). You are sending the titles from the server. And it is being read from the server every game tick. Not just an index in the cache, but the string itself. So in your case every tick(600ms) you are sending “Queen” to the client, which is 6 bytes. And unless you want to be the only person to see the title, then you must be sending it to every other player in the loaded region. If there were 9 other people in the region, then that would result in 60 bytes, <span class="bbcode-b">per tick</span> that are being used <span class="bbcode-b">solely</span> for the titles. After 1 hour, you have sent 360 KB of data <span class="bbcode-b">in total</span> to yourself, and the other 9 players in the region, just to display the title.</p>
<p>Now, I suspect that in your server, or another person’s, that more than just the owner will have a title. So if the other 9 people had titles as well</p>

<p>You are not doing it the way you described. The Mobilizing Armies is handled with an index read from a title list in the cache (as you clearly stated). You are not sending an index to anything. You are sending the actual string data, which increases the payload already; and then you are sending the string data in the player update block, <span class="bbcode-b">which is sent every 600ms</span>.</p>

<p>I believe he was referring to an “angry” argument where there’s only yelling and screaming going on, with neither side giving proof, or even a reasonable explanation as to why their stand is more appropriate. Yes, this is an argument in the sense that I am explaining myself in the <span class="bbcode-b">simplest</span> terms that I possibly can, while s/he is making no effort to defend h/is/er stance and is only saying that mine is wrong, while giving no explanation as to why.</p>

<p>Yes, both ways will work; but one will work better than the other. For example, there is a reason that the wheel is a circle, and not a square.</p>
