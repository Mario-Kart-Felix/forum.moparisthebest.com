    <title>Zipping files into single archives?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/zipping-files-into-single-archives/52482</link>
    <description>k. I have 2100 SNES roms that I want to zip up. I want them into diff archives (Mario.zip, Yoshi.zip)
But I don&#39;t want to manually zip 2100 roms. Is their a command line that I can use to zip these things up?</description>
