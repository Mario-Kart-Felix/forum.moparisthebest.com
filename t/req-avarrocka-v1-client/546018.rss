    <title>[REQ] Avarrocka V1 Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-avarrocka-v1-client/546018</link>
    <description>Been looking for this for a while. The links on the original thread don&#39;t work. If anyone has this, it would be much appreciated. I am aware of the April released client and that is not the one I&#39;m looking for. Thank you for anyone who is able to get me this.</description>
