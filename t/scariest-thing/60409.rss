              <p>hmmm, this one time me, my dad and his girlfriend and her kid and his friend all went for a bike ride in this one place, its like a trail, we all started going and i think my seat got messed up or something and me and my dad went back to the car, they kept going because they said they would, i don’t really remember much but i do remember that my dads girl friend saw this dude in the well wooded area and he said stuff like “wanna have sex” and shit and she was scared so she kept going and the kids were racing each other… they went WAY ahead of her and she ended up calling us and we picked her up and she was scared and the kids were gone… they biked like 10 miles then went onto a town and called his mom and we found them, it scared the shit out of me</p>
<p>there is also this site called <a href="http://gross.com" rel="nofollow noopener">gross.com</a> i think, it has like police reports about suicides and they have pics… like people who blew their face off with shotguns… its pretty scary (there is porn on the site, like a link, just to let you know)</p>

              <p>I have seen a few scary things. Not so much scary, just extremely disturbing. One time at a mud run, some guy just barely nicked someone’s car door and so then he comes out with a baseball bat and hit’s him over the head. He died in the ambulence. It made the most horrific sound ever when it hit him. Then my friend’s Uncle who is at least 350 pounds of pure muscle jumped in and clobbered the guy thankfully.</p>
<p>The other one which was not too long ago, and has made me want to stay away from big parties, is when someone came running down the stairs with a knife in his stomach at a party. I didn’t really see him too well until he collapsed. That was a pretty bad night. There has been too many deaths lately. 4 personal friends, and quite of people who I semi-knew.</p>
