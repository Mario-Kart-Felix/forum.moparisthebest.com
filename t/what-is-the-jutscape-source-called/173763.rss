    <title>What is the JutScape Source called?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-the-jutscape-source-called/173763</link>
    <description>There is\was a server called JutScape, which has a source I really want. I will describe it:

Farming Path in the trianing area
Ice barrage works on monsters, but needs runes
Rc altar next to bank at varrock
obby maul and granite maul attack like runescape
rune claws go into place, but you can use a weapon at same time.
Mouse toy gives like 9999999+
You must get a dragon chainbody from Kalphite Queen
Must get rares from admins
theres 3 portals i believe, one to barrows, one to a training area with drags and lessers that you can kill for bones for prayer, and 1 to a pking spot. I think one is red, and 2 are yellowish. I THINK those are the colors.

Anyone know? =)</description>
