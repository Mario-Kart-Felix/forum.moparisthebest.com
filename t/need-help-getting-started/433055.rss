    <description>Hello, im currently in afghanistan and internet is slow here so i decided to figure out how to get my own RSPS to play solo in my down time. I finally figured out how to get a server/client up and running...im currently playing around with runedream and Project Fr0z3n and was able to log in and start playing...but when I logg in i spawn in what I believe is edgeville, and after running outside the town I notice there are no NPC&#39;s and nothing is interactive...am I missing something? What do I need to do to get that fixed? Basically I just want to get this game as close to the original as possible and just be able to play solo in my off time. Also a tutorial on some really basic beginner stuff for setting up a server would be pretty cool. Ive done a lot of searching but the internet is terribly slow here so it takes forever to find anything and I&#39;ve had no luck.

Any help on this would be awesome and really appreciated thanks.


PS: although I&#39;m pretty new to java the whole server emulator thing isnt TOO new to me...ive played around making my own ragnarok online server and editing it a great deal, although this is very different.</description>
