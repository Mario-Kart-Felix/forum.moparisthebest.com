    <description>Hello Moparscape
I wanna learn more about coding, and what source should i dowload to start with?
And will it become a easier process to learning if i learned more about java before i went to the coding,
I have heard apollo / hypertion is good, but however i were thinking to find a blank project insanity and go from there.
Also, what basic things do i have to learn, before actually trying to code.
I don&#39;t wanna do Tutorials, that wont teatch me anything, that will only do it for me.
So, don&#39;t post the tutorials selection below, also do you think i will make a better process if i dowload a IDE?
I were thinking to buy a java book, is that worth it?

Thank you for your time.
Also, if this is the wrong selection please tell.</description>

              <p>If you want the easy way you might want to consider looking at some basic Java first: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/</a></p>
<p>After you start gaining some basic knowledge, you could try practicing it by making your own, simple programs, or even adding some things to your server. There is no such thing as a “good” source or a “bad” source for that matter, it highly reflects back to the programmer. Choose the base you are most comfortable with, take a look at the coding in each and see which one looks neater to you, and then go with the one you like best.</p>

              <p>I would go for Exion’s base. It was the first base I used and it was fine for what I wanted (PI btw). As for learning etc, you can just look at java books online. I’ve never actually used an IDE but I’m sure it’s better to start out using one so if you can, go for it. Good luck using java and developing <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
