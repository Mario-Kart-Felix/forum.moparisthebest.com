[CENTER][B][U][size=16pt]What is Relleka?[/size][/U][/B][/CENTER]
Relleka is a server that has been developed to achieve three  specific goals, to be unique, challenging, and above all fun. The server home is, of course, Rellekka*. Experience rates are challenging, allowing for more diversity among players. Coupled with this is a hard, nearly 100% player driven economy where the vast majority of items are either player made or obtained through drops. You won&#39;t find any gear shops here! This level of challenge creates something very rarely seen in many private servers today, a clear and overwhelming sense of accomplishment when either you finally get that skill you&#39;ve been working on to 99 or happen to finally get that lucky drop you&#39;ve been trying for.

*A tidbit of server history here, the city in RuneScape known as Rellekka is clearly spelled with two k&#39;s where the server name has only one, this was in fact an unintentional typo made early on in the server&#39;s development and has survived through it&#39;s release. The more you know!

[CENTER][B][U][size=16pt]What makes Relleka unique?[/size][/U][/B][/CENTER]
A unique feature of Relleka is that you will not find many teleports that bring you to various dungeons, instead, there is only one. From this one teleport you will begin in the first of a series of dungeons, with more being added all the time. Within these dungeons there is a clear progression of monsters that scale in difficulty the further you traverse into each dungeon. As you make your way deeper you will stumble across bosses of varying difficulty and style. Each boss has it&#39;s own scripted mechanics and unique drops for the player to learn and collect. Upon defeating the bosses found within any given dungeon, you will unlock access to the next where more bosses and other exclusive drops can be found. Progression is tracked via the quest tab which on Relleka is referred to as your “Challenge Journal”. Here you can track which bosses you have defeated and which you still need to defeat in order to unlock the next dungeon tier. In addition to these dungeons and bosses within, there are also world bosses that exist outside of these dungeons. With varying difficulty some can be easily managed by a solo player while others will require teams to defeat, again, with unique and exclusive drops to collect! While you slay your way through Relleka, you are bound to stumble on some key halves now and again. By combining two halves you can use the completed key to open a chest that could reward you with either skilling materials or even highly sought after clue rewards! Combat not your thing? Don&#39;t fret! Skillers are recognized too, having access to their own separate highscores table!

PvP is unique on this server too. Forget the wilderness, on Relleka PvP is primarily based in the desert. The ENTIRE desert is a PvP zone which also contains wilderness levels, but in a more unique way. Instead of scaling the deeper you venture into the wilderness, the wilderness level is instead based around hotspots. These hotspots can be thought of as ripples in a pond, with each ripple closer to the center being a higher wilderness level. Did I mention there&#39;s not just one of these hotspots? There are multiple found within the desert, with the center of each being important locations. One may be centered on some rune rocks, while another may be centered over an important dungeon entrance!

This server also features a custom loader for your client that will automatically pull client updates without requiring you to ever have to redownload the client, all for your convenience!


[CENTER][B][U][size=16pt]What is planned for the future of Relleka?[/size][/U][/B][/CENTER]
Expect more dungeons to be added regularly with new bosses and drops. Quality of life updates and aesthetic changes by player request often find their way into many of the patches and content updates as well. Many minigames are on the horizon are expected to make their way into the server as well. As for anything else, the player base has a huge influence on what&#39;s to come so if you have suggestions we&#39;d love to hear them!

              <p>Dungeon progression is great and rewarding, features may be limited presently but there’s never been a better time to start playing. Content is coming in stages, currently with Rune being the rarest armor in game, so now is the best time to get started if you are a player who enjoys being part of a server from the beginning! This server is going places, and I’ve known this owner for many years, he knows what hes doing, and I’m confident he will be able to provide regular updates and addition to the game as he says will.</p>
<p>Also, if you enjoy a challenging economy then you will love this server, no shop handouts, most items are either created or looted by players.</p>

<p>[CENTER][B][U][size=16pt]What is Relleka?[/size][/U][/B][/CENTER]<br>
Relleka is a server that has been developed to achieve three  specific goals, to be unique, challenging, and above all fun. The server home is, of course, Rellekka*. Experience rates are challenging, allowing for more diversity among players. Coupled with this is a hard, nearly 100% player driven economy where the vast majority of items are either player made or obtained through drops. You won’t find any gear shops here! This level of challenge creates something very rarely seen in many private servers today, a clear and overwhelming sense of accomplishment when either you finally get that skill you’ve been working on to 99 or happen to finally get that lucky drop you’ve been trying for.</p>
<p>*A tidbit of server history here, the city in RuneScape known as Rellekka is clearly spelled with two k’s where the server name has only one, this was in fact an unintentional typo made early on in the server’s development and has survived through it’s release. The more you know!</p>
<p>[CENTER][B][U][size=16pt]What makes Relleka unique?[/size][/U][/B][/CENTER]<br>
A unique feature of Relleka is that you will not find many teleports that bring you to various dungeons, instead, there is only one. From this one teleport you will begin in the first of a series of dungeons, with more being added all the time. Within these dungeons there is a clear progression of monsters that scale in difficulty the further you traverse into each dungeon. As you make your way deeper you will stumble across bosses of varying difficulty and style. Each boss has it’s own scripted mechanics and unique drops for the player to learn and collect. Upon defeating the bosses found within any given dungeon, you will unlock access to the next where more bosses and other exclusive drops can be found. Progression is tracked via the quest tab which on Relleka is referred to as your “Challenge Journal”. Here you can track which bosses you have defeated and which you still need to defeat in order to unlock the next dungeon tier. In addition to these dungeons and bosses within, there are also world bosses that exist outside of these dungeons. With varying difficulty some can be easily managed by a solo player while others will require teams to defeat, again, with unique and exclusive drops to collect! While you slay your way through Relleka, you are bound to stumble on some key halves now and again. By combining two halves you can use the completed key to open a chest that could reward you with either skilling materials or even highly sought after clue rewards! Combat not your thing? Don’t fret! Skillers are recognized too, having access to their own separate highscores table!</p>
<p>PvP is unique on this server too. Forget the wilderness, on Relleka PvP is primarily based in the desert. The ENTIRE desert is a PvP zone which also contains wilderness levels, but in a more unique way. Instead of scaling the deeper you venture into the wilderness, the wilderness level is instead based around hotspots. These hotspots can be thought of as ripples in a pond, with each ripple closer to the center being a higher wilderness level. Did I mention there’s not just one of these hotspots? There are multiple found within the desert, with the center of each being important locations. One may be centered on some rune rocks, while another may be centered over an important dungeon entrance!</p>
<p>This server also features a custom loader for your client that will automatically pull client updates without requiring you to ever have to redownload the client, all for your convenience!</p>
<p>[CENTER][B][U][size=16pt]What is planned for the future of Relleka?[/size][/U][/B][/CENTER]<br>
Expect more dungeons to be added regularly with new bosses and drops. Quality of life updates and aesthetic changes by player request often find their way into many of the patches and content updates as well. Many minigames are on the horizon are expected to make their way into the server as well. As for anything else, the player base has a huge influence on what’s to come so if you have suggestions we’d love to hear them!</p>
