    <title>Creating a teleporting timer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-teleporting-timer/244753</link>
    <description>Hi, I recently did the Lunar Interface tut and now I&#39;m working on making the spells work.  I want players to only be able to use the Home teleport every 30 minutes. Can anyone help me create a teleporting timer?  And I want it to save how long the player has on the timer if he logs out.  thanks in advance</description>
