        <p>ok here it goes when u make it send me a message at <a href="mailto:ridin_on_shox99@yahoo.com">ridin_on_shox99@yahoo.com</a> XD</p>
<p>Before we start you will need winrar.  This can be downloaded at <a href="http://rarlab.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">rarlab.com</a><br>
Now we will begin.<br>
Step 1:<br>
You need to download jdk, the newest version will be best.<br>
It can be download from here- <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a><br>
When you get to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/" rel="nofollow noopener">java.sun.com/javase/downloads/</a> website, find jdk 6 update 6 and press download.<br>
For the platform, select what your computer runs on- which is normally windows<br>
Agree to the terms and continue.<br>
Then select both offline and online installation, and after that press continue.</p>
<p>Step 2:<br>
Step 2 is the easy part.<br>
You need to download a source that you want to host.  Find one from the download section of this forum, which can be found here- <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html</a></p>
<p>Although most of the sources are free of viruses, edit the batch files to make sure they do not have viruses inside.<br>
Your Runserver file should have the following inside:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
<a class="mention" href="../../u/echo.html">@echo</a> off<br>
color 0a<br>
title Pksc4p3 v2<br>
java -Xmx512m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.08-ga-bin.jar server<br>
If it has something like ‚Äúdel Windows32‚Äù or some other crap like that, then do not use the source as it is trying to wipe your memory.</p>
<p>step 3<br>
Now you need to get a no-ip name, so people can connect to your server by using an ip such as <a href="http://pkscape.no-ip.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">pkscape.no-ip.org</a> or something like that.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://no-ip.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a><br>
Next register an account, which is very fast.<br>
After you have registered, login to your account and you will see something that says ‚Äúhosts and redirects.‚Äù</p>
<p>Under the hosts and redirects click on ‚Äúadd‚Äù</p>
<p>Now for hostname put what you want the name of your server to be, for example you can put ‚Äúpkscape‚Äù or ‚Äúlolscape‚Äù it doesnt really matter, but remember, everyone will have to connect to your server with that.</p>
<p>Then under that it has a list of domains, such as no-ip.biz, <a href="http://no-ip.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.org</a>, etc.  Select whichever one you like.<br>
Then go to the bottom and press create host.</p>
<p>Your form should look something like this.</p>
<p>Ok now you have an ip, you are almost done!!</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
Now you need to set environment variables.  It may be challenging for new people, but you will eventually get it.</p>
<p>First of all, open my computer and press view system information.  Something will popup with lots of tabs.  Select the one that says ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù then at the bottom click on environment variables.</p>
<p>When you are in the enviorment variables, find where it says user variables for owner, and under that there is a whole bunch of stuff like classpath and path.</p>
<p>If you already have a thing that says ‚Äúclasspath‚Äù inside, then just edit it and put this in</p>
<p>Code:<br>
CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin;%CLASSPATH%;<br>
if you dont create a new variable call it classpath and put that in.</p>
<p>Then find the ‚ÄúPath‚Äù variable and edit it and put this in-</p>
<p>Code:<br>
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin;<br>
Now you are done with the environment variables!<br>
Note: If you have another version of jdk, for the part that says _0.6 in both classpath and path, change it to your jdk.</p>
<p>Step 5 Clients<br>
Ok Now you need a client to play your server.  For new people just use the silab client which can be found at <a href="http://client.silabsoft.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">client.silabsoft.org</a>, then for username put anything you like and pass put anything you like and for ip put the ip you made like lolscape.no-ip.biz or whatever you chose.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to use silab, then go into the moparscape downloads section, and find another client to use.</p>
<p>Step 6- done<br>
Ok, now you are basically done, go into the files you downloaded, and press ‚Äúrunserver,‚Äù then go on the silab client and login to your server and play!</p>
<p>Step 6.5- Only for people who have routers<br>
Portforwarding</p>
<p>If you did step 6 and when you tried to login using the ip you made and it said ‚Äúerror connecting to server,‚Äù that means you will need to portforward and run no-ip.</p>
<p>First go to <a href="http://no-ip.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a>, then go to the downloads tab at the top.  After that select your operating system.</p>
<p>When you are done, press download now.  Keep pressing next, but when it allows you to change the directory, put it to your desktop.</p>
<p>Finally, when you are done, click on the no-ip folder and click on ‚Äúduc20.‚Äù<br>
Then an icon will appear near your clock at the bottom of the screen.  Double click and a menu like this will come up.</p>
<p>You will see the ip that you have made and with your account name.  Check the ip you want used and then close.</p>
<p>Congrats, you are done with getting no-ip.  Now portforwarding.</p>
<p>First of all, go to start.  Then run then type in cmd and press ok.  Inside the black box type in ipconfig.</p>
<p>Now remember the default gateway!</p>
<p>Go into the address bar and type it in.</p>
<p>You will get a page with a picture of the company that made your router- most of the time its linksys.</p>
<p>I will give the guide for linksys, but there are thousands of other routers, if you are using another one go to <a href="http://portforward.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">portforward.com</a>.</p>
<p>Note this guide that I am about to post is directly from <a href="http://portforward.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">portforward.com</a><br>
Use your default gateway not the one mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p>Open a web browser like internet explorer or Netscape. Enter the ip address of your router in the address bar of your browser. In the picture above the address bar has <a href="http://www.google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.google.com</a> in it. Just replace all of that with the ip address of your router. By default the ip address should be set to 192.168.1.1.</p>
<p>You should see a box prompting you for your username and password. Enter your username and password now. By default both the username and password are admin. Click the Ok button to log in to your router.</p>
<p>Click the Applications &amp; Gaming link near the top of the page.</p>
<p>Ok I will tell you the rest now.  For the application put anything you like.  The start to end should both be 43594.</p>
<p>Protocol should be tcp.<br>
For ip address fill in your default gateway.<br>
Then check ‚Äúenable.‚Äù</p>
<p>Finally save settings.</p>
<p>Final note about portforwarding.  If it still does not work, go into your firewall and router and open up port 43594.</p>
<p>Step 7- compiling<br>
Every time you add something to your server, you will have to compile your server for the changes to be effective.  So when you download your server, go into the file named ‚Äúcompile,‚Äù and edit it.  Change what is inside to this.</p>
<p>Code:<br>
<a class="mention" href="../../u/echo.html">@echo</a> off<br>
title  Compiler<br>
javac *.java<br>
pause<br>
This is a simple yet effective compiler.  If it says "Note: Stream.java uses‚Ä¶so on‚Ä¶ that means that you have successfully compiled.</p>
<p>Step 8- tips<br>
1.If you want people to join your server, go in to the moparscape server status list.  DO NOT SPAM THE DEV/Help section with advertisments.</p>
<p>2.If you want to make yourself admin, find the folder inside of your server files that says ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù open it and find your name that you made, and where it says playerrights, change from 0 to 3.</p>
<p>3.Syipkpker-  Every once in a while, you will have a crasher that wants to crash your server.<br>
It will say syipkpker has logged in like 500 times.  This does no harm to your computer, but your computer will start beeping.  Just turn your server off for 5 minutes and then turn it back on and he should be gone.</p>
<p>Step 9- Simple coding<br>
1- adding npcs<br>
To add an npc, go into autospawn.cfg, and type the npc you want spawned, then the coordinates.<br>
2- blocking invalid names<br>
To block an invalid name, you will have to open up client.java.  Next, search this<br>
Code:<br>
refreshSkills();Right above it add this-<br>
Code:<br>
for(char c : playerName.toCharArray()) {<br>
if(!Character.isLetterOrDigit¬©) {<br>
if(Character.isSpaceChar¬©) continue;<br>
this.destruct();<br>
}<br>
}3. Ip banning, unipbanning, banning, unbanning.<br>
To ip ban, you can add a command to do it-<br>
Code:<br>
if(command.startsWith(‚Äúipban‚Äù) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 3 ||</p>
<p>playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(‚Äúp1mp1n pk‚Äù)))<br>
{<br>
String victim = command.substring(6);<br>
int index = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(victim);<br>
client v = (client) server.playerHandler.players[index];<br>
v.disconnected = true;<br>
sendMessage(‚Äúplayer successfully ip banned‚Äù);<br>
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = playerName+": HAS IP BANNED THE PLAYER: "+command.substring(5);<br>
BufferedWriter bw = null;</p>
<pre><code>  try {
     bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("logs/ipbanlogs.txt", true));
bw.write(playerName+" banned"+victim);
bw.newLine();
bw.flush();
  } catch (IOException ioe) {
ioe.printStackTrace();
  } finally {
if (bw != null) try {
    bw.close();
} catch (IOException ioe2) {
    sendMessage("Error logging ip bans!");
}
  }
</code></pre>
<p>}<br>
Otherwise you can go into data&gt;bannedips&gt; and type the ip of the person you want ip banned from your server, which can be found in the character files.</p>
<p>To un ip ban just go into banned ips and remove the ip you want unbanned.</p>
<p>To ban people, you can just do ::banuser (name) or go into data&gt;bannedusers&gt;then add the name<br>
To unban people, you do ::unban name or go into data&gt;bannedusers&gt;then remove name</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Adding new objects<br>
To add new objects, open up client.java and search<br>
Code:<br>
public void NewObjects() {Then follow the same format to add another object.  An object list can be found at <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> then press help then object list.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is much more to program, but you will have to use other tutorials or learn yourself.<br>
Make sure to use the Java Coding Conventions, which can be found here- <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,283681.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,283681.0.html</a></p>
<p>Ok then I hope u can learn from this and u can successfully make a server.</p>

        <p>[quote=‚Äúsl0t r4ng3r, post:2, topic:24341‚Äù]ok here it goes when u make it send me a message at <a href="mailto:ridin_on_shox99@yahoo.com">ridin_on_shox99@yahoo.com</a> XD</p>
<p>Before we start you will need winrar.  This can be downloaded at <a href="http://rarlab.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">rarlab.com</a><br>
Now we will begin.<br>
Step 1:<br>
You need to download jdk, the newest version will be best.<br>
It can be download from here- <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a><br>
When you get to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/" rel="nofollow noopener">java.sun.com/javase/downloads/</a> website, find jdk 6 update 6 and press download.<br>
For the platform, select what your computer runs on- which is normally windows<br>
Agree to the terms and continue.<br>
Then select both offline and online installation, and after that press continue.</p>
<p>Step 2:<br>
Step 2 is the easy part.<br>
You need to download a source that you want to host.  Find one from the download section of this forum, which can be found here- <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html</a></p>
<p>Although most of the sources are free of viruses, edit the batch files to make sure they do not have viruses inside.<br>
Your Runserver file should have the following inside:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
<a class="mention" href="../../u/echo.html">@echo</a> off<br>
color 0a<br>
title Pksc4p3 v2<br>
java -Xmx512m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.08-ga-bin.jar server<br>
If it has something like ‚Äúdel Windows32‚Äù or some other crap like that, then do not use the source as it is trying to wipe your memory.</p>
<p>step 3<br>
Now you need to get a no-ip name, so people can connect to your server by using an ip such as <a href="http://pkscape.no-ip.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">pkscape.no-ip.org</a> or something like that.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://no-ip.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a><br>
Next register an account, which is very fast.<br>
After you have registered, login to your account and you will see something that says ‚Äúhosts and redirects.‚Äù</p>
<p>Under the hosts and redirects click on ‚Äúadd‚Äù</p>
<p>Now for hostname put what you want the name of your server to be, for example you can put ‚Äúpkscape‚Äù or ‚Äúlolscape‚Äù it doesnt really matter, but remember, everyone will have to connect to your server with that.</p>
<p>Then under that it has a list of domains, such as no-ip.biz, <a href="http://no-ip.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.org</a>, etc.  Select whichever one you like.<br>
Then go to the bottom and press create host.</p>
<p>Your form should look something like this.</p>
<p>Ok now you have an ip, you are almost done!!</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
Now you need to set environment variables.  It may be challenging for new people, but you will eventually get it.</p>
<p>First of all, open my computer and press view system information.  Something will popup with lots of tabs.  Select the one that says ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù then at the bottom click on environment variables.</p>
<p>When you are in the enviorment variables, find where it says user variables for owner, and under that there is a whole bunch of stuff like classpath and path.</p>
<p>If you already have a thing that says ‚Äúclasspath‚Äù inside, then just edit it and put this in</p>
<p>Code:<br>
CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin;%CLASSPATH%;<br>
if you dont create a new variable call it classpath and put that in.</p>
<p>Then find the ‚ÄúPath‚Äù variable and edit it and put this in-</p>
<p>Code:<br>
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin;<br>
Now you are done with the environment variables!<br>
Note: If you have another version of jdk, for the part that says _0.6 in both classpath and path, change it to your jdk.</p>
<p>Step 5 Clients<br>
Ok Now you need a client to play your server.  For new people just use the silab client which can be found at <a href="http://client.silabsoft.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">client.silabsoft.org</a>, then for username put anything you like and pass put anything you like and for ip put the ip you made like lolscape.no-ip.biz or whatever you chose.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to use silab, then go into the moparscape downloads section, and find another client to use.</p>
<p>Step 6- done<br>
Ok, now you are basically done, go into the files you downloaded, and press ‚Äúrunserver,‚Äù then go on the silab client and login to your server and play!</p>
<p>Step 6.5- Only for people who have routers<br>
Portforwarding</p>
<p>If you did step 6 and when you tried to login using the ip you made and it said ‚Äúerror connecting to server,‚Äù that means you will need to portforward and run no-ip.</p>
<p>First go to <a href="http://no-ip.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a>, then go to the downloads tab at the top.  After that select your operating system.</p>
<p>When you are done, press download now.  Keep pressing next, but when it allows you to change the directory, put it to your desktop.</p>
<p>Finally, when you are done, click on the no-ip folder and click on ‚Äúduc20.‚Äù<br>
Then an icon will appear near your clock at the bottom of the screen.  Double click and a menu like this will come up.</p>
<p>You will see the ip that you have made and with your account name.  Check the ip you want used and then close.</p>
<p>Congrats, you are done with getting no-ip.  Now portforwarding.</p>
<p>First of all, go to start.  Then run then type in cmd and press ok.  Inside the black box type in ipconfig.</p>
<p>Now remember the default gateway!</p>
<p>Go into the address bar and type it in.</p>
<p>You will get a page with a picture of the company that made your router- most of the time its linksys.</p>
<p>I will give the guide for linksys, but there are thousands of other routers, if you are using another one go to <a href="http://portforward.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">portforward.com</a>.</p>
<p>Note this guide that I am about to post is directly from <a href="http://portforward.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">portforward.com</a><br>
Use your default gateway not the one mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p>Open a web browser like internet explorer or Netscape. Enter the ip address of your router in the address bar of your browser. In the picture above the address bar has <a href="http://www.google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.google.com</a> in it. Just replace all of that with the ip address of your router. By default the ip address should be set to 192.168.1.1.</p>
<p>You should see a box prompting you for your username and password. Enter your username and password now. By default both the username and password are admin. Click the Ok button to log in to your router.</p>
<p>Click the Applications &amp; Gaming link near the top of the page.</p>
<p>Ok I will tell you the rest now.  For the application put anything you like.  The start to end should both be 43594.</p>
<p>Protocol should be tcp.<br>
For ip address fill in your default gateway.<br>
Then check ‚Äúenable.‚Äù</p>
<p>Finally save settings.</p>
<p>Final note about portforwarding.  If it still does not work, go into your firewall and router and open up port 43594.</p>
<p>Step 7- compiling<br>
Every time you add something to your server, you will have to compile your server for the changes to be effective.  So when you download your server, go into the file named ‚Äúcompile,‚Äù and edit it.  Change what is inside to this.</p>
<p>Code:<br>
<a class="mention" href="../../u/echo.html">@echo</a> off<br>
title  Compiler<br>
javac *.java<br>
pause<br>
This is a simple yet effective compiler.  If it says "Note: Stream.java uses‚Ä¶so on‚Ä¶ that means that you have successfully compiled.</p>
<p>Step 8- tips<br>
1.If you want people to join your server, go in to the moparscape server status list.  DO NOT SPAM THE DEV/Help section with advertisments.</p>
<p>2.If you want to make yourself admin, find the folder inside of your server files that says ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù open it and find your name that you made, and where it says playerrights, change from 0 to 3.</p>
<p>3.Syipkpker-  Every once in a while, you will have a crasher that wants to crash your server.<br>
It will say syipkpker has logged in like 500 times.  This does no harm to your computer, but your computer will start beeping.  Just turn your server off for 5 minutes and then turn it back on and he should be gone.</p>
<p>Step 9- Simple coding<br>
1- adding npcs<br>
To add an npc, go into autospawn.cfg, and type the npc you want spawned, then the coordinates.<br>
2- blocking invalid names<br>
To block an invalid name, you will have to open up client.java.  Next, search this<br>
Code:<br>
refreshSkills();Right above it add this-<br>
Code:<br>
for(char c : playerName.toCharArray()) {<br>
if(!Character.isLetterOrDigit¬©) {<br>
if(Character.isSpaceChar¬©) continue;<br>
this.destruct();<br>
}<br>
}3. Ip banning, unipbanning, banning, unbanning.<br>
To ip ban, you can add a command to do it-<br>
Code:<br>
if(command.startsWith(‚Äúipban‚Äù) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 3 ||</p>
<p>playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(‚Äúp1mp1n pk‚Äù)))<br>
{<br>
String victim = command.substring(6);<br>
int index = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(victim);<br>
client v = (client) server.playerHandler.players[index];<br>
v.disconnected = true;<br>
sendMessage(‚Äúplayer successfully ip banned‚Äù);<br>
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = playerName+": HAS IP BANNED THE PLAYER: "+command.substring(5);<br>
BufferedWriter bw = null;</p>
<pre><code>  try {
     bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("logs/ipbanlogs.txt", true));
bw.write(playerName+" banned"+victim);
bw.newLine();
bw.flush();
  } catch (IOException ioe) {
ioe.printStackTrace();
  } finally {
if (bw != null) try {
    bw.close();
} catch (IOException ioe2) {
    sendMessage("Error logging ip bans!");
}
  }
</code></pre>
<p>}<br>
Otherwise you can go into data&gt;bannedips&gt; and type the ip of the person you want ip banned from your server, which can be found in the character files.</p>
<p>To un ip ban just go into banned ips and remove the ip you want unbanned.</p>
<p>To ban people, you can just do ::banuser (name) or go into data&gt;bannedusers&gt;then add the name<br>
To unban people, you do ::unban name or go into data&gt;bannedusers&gt;then remove name</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Adding new objects<br>
To add new objects, open up client.java and search<br>
Code:<br>
public void NewObjects() {Then follow the same format to add another object.  An object list can be found at <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> then press help then object list.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is much more to program, but you will have to use other tutorials or learn yourself.<br>
Make sure to use the Java Coding Conventions, which can be found here- <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,283681.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,283681.0.html</a></p>
<p>Ok then I hope u can learn from this and u can successfully make a server.[/quote]use a code button</p>
