<p>Then why the fuck are we going to give you our money?  I mean, if it was a private server I played a lot and really liked, I’d gladly give a bit of money to it.  But tell me why you need the money more than say, AzuriteYT on youtube?  I enjoy his videos and he owes $5000+ in taxes, so why should I give you money for a half baked serer that won’t run for long when I could help one of my favorite content producers on Youtube get out of serious debt that hes currently stuck in?</p>

              <p>the $250 was not invested into trisidia, you are misunderstanding me, my VPN and website was bought for my 714, Im merely using an old server ive tinkered around with to get a hang of Hosting, which i do not know much about. Instead of calling me a leecher without hearing the story, possibly help me out. Yes I use guides to see if im on the right track, I cant learn anything without an example, I mean, i could of probably easily done the Grand Exchange without a guide, but im sure i would of left something out, using the guide as a reference makes for more productive work. Trisidia is merely a test, im getting the hang of all of this so im not just jumping into the ordeal blind. Now, I know enough about java i can skim a guide and have enough knowledge to understand it and get the concept. I started learning java from RSPS, that was years ago, Ive been trying to make a framework where everything is stored into a database, making organization streamlined and efficient. Ive surpassed the usefulness of an IDE. Navicat is going to be the new eclipse, as for proof? Go look in the server…theres plenty proof there, its running so stable, I have a login spammer which allows me to stress test the servers population stability, 300 players were logged in with absloutely NO lag, Id say thats one hell of an improvement from the original Trisidia, youd be lucky to get it running. Just because my post count is low doesnt mean i havent been lurking here for a loooong time. Hell i remember when 317’s first came out.</p>

              <p>How does hiring a professional team defeat the purpose of making a fresh framework? If anything, it will make the community smile down on you because they see actual effort is put into creating a private server.<br>
I can say I rewrote my packet handler as well. I can say I patched 133 memory leaks as well. But, without any physical or visual proof, your word means nothing. Show us how rewriting these and patching these impacts the game beneficially.<br>
Writing your own framework does not make you a leecher. This has been discussed multiple times in the past; writing a framework means you created your server from scratch. You’re just using a modified RuneScape client to connect to your server.<br>
It’s not like the ‘Post New Topic’ button dissapears once you get onto a computer. The effort put into an advertisement thread reflects the effort put into your server.<br>
Using a guide doesn’t help you learn unless at the end of the tutorial you understand all of the code and are able to modify it to your own liking. No, changing some values does not count as learning.<br>
You would be able to understand the flaming if you saw how ridiculous investing $250 into a Trisidia source is.</p>

              <p>^This coding an NPC was meaning creating movement boxes for each npc, allowing them to be attackable, interactions, Interfaces, etc. How about you try the server before you sit there and flame, assuming makes an ass out of you and me.</p>
<p>Also, id rather make my own source, not have some “professional team” do it, that defeats the purpose, and i chose this source for its challenge, it had 133 memory leaks (which i fixed) 3 dupe methods, the packet handler was inefficient and a$$ backwards. I mean, wtf is the point of trying when no matter what im a leecher? I mean if you really want to get technical how about we compare the proggies from the original trisidia source to mine? I can assure you people would love for me to release this source seeing as a lot of how the server handles connections has been re-written, making my source much more stable than its predecessor. Ill get to pics, media here shortly, i was only trying to get a head start from my ipad which isnt very easy to configure a forum post on quickly. And as a matter of fact, I have a 714 framework in progress, completely redone using databases and Navicat to edit, making compiling, adding content and executing updates so much better. This is only a small test compared to whats going to come, which is why im not putting so much effort into this servers media and advertisment.</p>
<p>And who the heck cares if theres a guide for it? Just because there is a guide doesnt mean it doesnt have to be done…yes i used a guide to incorporate the grand exchange into the server, That is one way people learn, getting the help of others, thats not leeching. I learn from other peoples mistakes, this source had a lot of them, making learning a new thing easier. I could understand the flaming if i got the most stable source, changed the home and client background and called it mine.</p>

              <p>Ok…would you like to see the VPN and website reciept?<br>
And second, its not a leech, I added 3 new ranks, auto donation, several new interfaces, 20 achievements, Smuggling bugfixes, SoF Gfxes, Proper curse Drains, dont get me started on cycling times, including proper Combat speeds, Oh and i dont believe that the original TrisidiaX source included a grand exchange, which u can look for yourself, before accusing someone of leeching, the only thing i left the same was shops, i didnt want to touch them because of how unstable this source is with spawn changes. Did i mention that it spawns 9000 npc’s? Cuz last time i checked Trisidia only coded about 2000…but yea…im a leecher…</p>
