Some of you may have seen the Oberon development thread, which can be found here: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,532583.msg3892722.html#msg3892722]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,532583.msg3892722.html#msg3892722[/url]
Unfortunately, progress halted once I got a new computer and lost all my server files. However, I&#39;ve gained access to a version of the source and I would like to continue developing this project once more. The main reason I failed to keep dedication in the past is because I had no development team, which is why I made this topic. I&#39;m looking for at least 2 more developers to help me increase the progress of Oberon.
[hr]

If you are interested, you might want to take a look at some of our goals:

[ul][li][b]Realistic as possible[/b] - I want to try to make the game playable, but also logical as to what occurs in real RS.[/li]
	[li][b]Few Bugs/Glitches[/b] - It is impossible to create something that is flawless, because the opinions of others always breaks down something into an error, so I will try my best to maintain server function in an orderly fashion.[/li]
	[li][b]100% F2P[/b] - Of course, you will be able to purchase some virtual goods, but all the content will be accessible to all players - please understand that people that pay for a virtual good will have easier access to the content than free players will.[/li]
	[li][b]Experience[/b] - This is the biggest factor in any game, and this includes things such as drop rates, leveling rates, and even the economy. A player will have to put time into their characters, therefore everyone will have a reasonable, yet challenging, experience and drop rate.[/li]
	[li][b]Community[/b] - I want players to come back to Oberon for not only the content, but the community. A bad community is bound to deflect players&#39; attentions.[/li]
	[li][b]Non-profit[/b] - After the official release, developers will not be instantly payed, but as server population and funds increase, they will. I&#39;m not looking forward to creating this project for my own profit, but solely to get a new and friendly community up.[/li][/ul]
I hope other developers agree with at least one goal I&#39;ve mentioned, but this is a world of opinion, so please discuss your view on this team.

[hr]

Last, but definitely not least, here is the application for a spot on the team:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]What position would you like to take?[/b] (Server Developer, Client Developer, GFX Designer or Website Designer)
[b]Why do you want this position?[/b]
[b]Do you have any form of proof that you are qualified to take on this role? If so, please demonstrate it.[/b]
[b]Do you have any form of communication besides this website? [/b](Skype, MSN, etc.)
[b]What time zone/region are you from?[/b]
[b]What schedule will you be able to provide? [/b](Day of the week, hours of that day, etc.)
[b]Why are you interested in joining this team?[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;


I&#39;m not going to be strict about the format you put it in, but make sure you have all of the questions answered to the best of your ability.

              <p>What position would you like to take?: <span class="bbcode-b">Other (Admin/Moderator - In Game and Forums)<br>
</span><br>
Why do you want this position?: <span class="bbcode-b">I’m great with socializing. I’m a christian and I witness to strangers. So I’m pretty good at anything social-like. I can help your online players with any questions they ask. Also, I can help run the forums and make sure everyone follows the rules. My only rule for that is, since I’m christian, I will no respond to any profanity(cursing) or anything perverted.</span></p>
<p>Do you have any form of proof that you are qualified to take on this role? If so, please demonstrate it.: <span class="bbcode-b">I had an unfinished project. It was somone’s released source, it also a 639. I was going to use it as a base. But I have problems with coding considering I’m a bit new at java coding. So I’m more interested in helping others with problems. I actually enjoy answering the questions of overs. Don’t ask why, cause I have no clue, lol.</span></p>
<p>Do you have any form of communication besides this website? (Skype, MSN, etc.): <span class="bbcode-b">I have Skype. My Skype name is <span class="bbcode-i">aaron.skinner4</span>.</span></p>
<p>What time zone/region are you from?: <span class="bbcode-b">Central Time Zone.</span></p>
<p>What schedule will you be able to provide? (Day of the week, hours of that day, etc.): <span class="bbcode-b">I’m actually homeschooled, and I’m going to my GED. So you wouldn’t believe how much free time I have on my hands. There will be some days that I’m not available because I have church activities. But mostly any hour of the day, and any day of the week. Except Sunday and Wednesdays. Like I said, sometimes I have church activities but I’d let you know ahead of time.</span></p>
<p>Why are you interested in joining this team?: <span class="bbcode-b">You don’t even know how much fun I have helping people. Lol. I’d enjoy answering their questions. I’d enjoy enforcing the rules. I’d enjoy making sure everyone has a great time and enjoyed their stay on your server.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">If you have any more questions for me, just ask and I’d be more then happy to answer them.</span></p>

Going to add you now and discuss a few matters with you. Thanks for the application.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/uncalled">@Uncalled</a>, are you trolling me or what? If not, I’d be happy to work with you. Also, the reason you want the position and why you would like to join this team are two separate things? You may want the position to learn, and to join the team just for fun?</p>

Thanks for the application, but I’m looking for someone that is already experienced in the era of what they wish to work in, rather than someone that is doing this for a learning experience.</p>

Some of you may have seen the Oberon development thread, which can be found here: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,532583.msg3892722.html#msg3892722" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,532583.msg3892722.html#msg3892722</a><br>
Unfortunately, progress halted once I got a new computer and lost all my server files. However, I’ve gained access to a version of the source and I would like to continue developing this project once more. The main reason I failed to keep dedication in the past is because I had no development team, which is why I made this topic. I’m looking for at least 2 more developers to help me increase the progress of Oberon.<br>
[hr]</p>
<p>If you are interested, you might want to take a look at some of our goals:</p>
<p>[ul][li]<span class="bbcode-b">Realistic as possible</span> - I want to try to make the game playable, but also logical as to what occurs in real RS.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Few Bugs/Glitches</span> - It is impossible to create something that is flawless, because the opinions of others always breaks down something into an error, so I will try my best to maintain server function in an orderly fashion.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">100% F2P</span> - Of course, you will be able to purchase some virtual goods, but all the content will be accessible to all players - please understand that people that pay for a virtual good will have easier access to the content than free players will.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Experience</span> - This is the biggest factor in any game, and this includes things such as drop rates, leveling rates, and even the economy. A player will have to put time into their characters, therefore everyone will have a reasonable, yet challenging, experience and drop rate.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Community</span> - I want players to come back to Oberon for not only the content, but the community. A bad community is bound to deflect players’ attentions.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Non-profit</span> - After the official release, developers will not be instantly payed, but as server population and funds increase, they will. I’m not looking forward to creating this project for my own profit, but solely to get a new and friendly community up.[/li][/ul]<br>
I hope other developers agree with at least one goal I’ve mentioned, but this is a world of opinion, so please discuss your view on this team.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>Last, but definitely not least, here is the application for a spot on the team:</p>
<blockquote>[b]What position would you like to take?[/b] (Server Developer, Client Developer, GFX Designer or Website Designer)
[b]Why do you want this position?[/b]
[b]Do you have any form of proof that you are qualified to take on this role? If so, please demonstrate it.[/b]
[b]Do you have any form of communication besides this website? [/b](Skype, MSN, etc.)
[b]What time zone/region are you from?[/b]
[b]What schedule will you be able to provide? [/b](Day of the week, hours of that day, etc.)
[b]Why are you interested in joining this team?[/b]</blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to be strict about the format you put it in, but make sure you have all of the questions answered to the best of your ability.</p>
