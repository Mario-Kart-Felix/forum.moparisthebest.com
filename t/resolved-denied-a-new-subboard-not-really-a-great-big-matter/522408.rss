    <title>[RESOLVED - DENIED] A new subboard - not really a great big matter</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-denied-a-new-subboard-not-really-a-great-big-matter/522408</link>
    <description>[s]I was thinking that we need a &quot;requests&quot; subboard for Web design/development (since I&#39;ve seen a lot of topics on people requesting web developers). It&#39;s not a great big thing, it&#39;s just a small thing that&#39;d make the forums a bit better.[/s]

[quote=&quot;Loveandpower&quot;]I would support [b]a direct tutorial section though and it could have required tags like [RUBY] [HTML] etc[/b][/quote]
I changed my suggestion. This idea would make the web development board a bit more clearer, and more organised. And it&#39;ll also help new people to find tutorials, instead of going through hundreds of pages.</description>
