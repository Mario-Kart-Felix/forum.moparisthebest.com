    <description>I&#39;ve been fiddling with Renagades Ultimate Fisher, in the fishing guild. It seems to (mostly) run the way it&#39;s supposed to, assuming I did what I was supposed to. I am new to scar scripting, so most of this is greek to me. I set my client to low detail and v-bright, and I am running on 32bit color. I also set the dock color, grass color next to dock, and bank floor color on minimap. The problem I am having is when the script goes to bank fishies, it clicks right above or to the left of the bank, outside of it. I am trying to get it to click inside the bank rather than run all the way around behind it. I tried to post the script in code tags, but too many characters, so here is a link to the same script.

If someone can help me get this fixed i&#39;ll pay some RS2 gold, don&#39;t wanna be a leecher XD</description>

<p>Well, if you knew how to code in scar then you might be able to fix it. E-mail <a href="mailto:Marcbauvil@aol.com">Marcbauvil@aol.com</a>  with the EXACT thing you have and i’ll take a look.</p>
