Ok first go into NPCHandler.java and search for <code>moo</code></p>
<p>After the last }<br>
Paste this in.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">					if (npcs[i].npcType == INSERT NPC ID HERE!) {
						if (misc.random2(50) == 1) {
							npcs[i].updateRequired = true;
							npcs[i].textUpdateRequired = true;
							npcs[i].textUpdate = "INSERT WHAT YOU WANT YOUR NPC TO SAY HERE";
						}
					}code]

<p>At the INSERT bits put in what it says…</p>
