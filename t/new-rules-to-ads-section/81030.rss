    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;1. No layout is required, but be sure to include all relevant information needed to play on your server
2. Post topics for your own server, nobody else&#39;s
3. If you want to advertise a website for your forum, do it inside your topic
4. Think before you post - if it&#39;s irrelevant, then don&#39;t post
5. No Hamachi
6. Don&#39;t ask about server status - This means asking whether the server is up or not&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In rule 5, does the mean were are not allowed hamachi servers? :|</description>

              <p>not at all lol, btw hamachi is the host…not the server :P, i think it means you dont have to put whether it has hamachi if you don’t,just as long as the required information is there for the server.</p>
