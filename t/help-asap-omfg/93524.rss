    <description>Alrighty , i added tons of new stuff to my server. And then  i start it up and try to log on and it starts to log on for like 2 minutes then logs me off.... the screen just shows The Interface and then logs out with a black screen... what did i do wrong? Do i have to restart?

Note: Before this happened i was screwing around with controls like monster hp , item bonuses etc.</description>

              <p>You may have an item in your inventory that mopar can’t take with it’s current cache, like an easter ring. Try making a new name and if you can log on, thats probly it and delete your charactor file, but if not, then its not the problem and you messed something in your code and thats why you always make a backup of your server code.</p>
