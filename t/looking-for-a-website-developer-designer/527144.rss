    <title>Looking For A Website Developer/Designer</title>

    <description>Hello Moparians,

I am currently searching for someone who is able to design websites and make them look good. I&#39;m not looking for any rookies right now, sorry. Although this is much to ask, because of the fact that you aren&#39;t being paid - I am hoping someone with some skill can help a friend out.

Sincerely,
Tragedy</description>

              <p>Oh yes, sorry I forgot to mention that. This is for a runescape private server. Also, thank you for volunteering. If you could PM me, that’d be great.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>

              <p>Hey, I wouldn’t mind helping you out, I’m not really looking for anything in particular such as staff, donator, etc.</p>
<p>I was wondering if this was for a runescape private server or what?</p>
<p>My skills are: HTML, CSS, Basic PHP (6/10) and Basic Javascript(6/10).</p>
