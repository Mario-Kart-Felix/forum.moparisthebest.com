<p>if you program well in Java, you can edit your client so when it sets up its connection with the server , it sends a String of data, and waits for a reply. the server will only start up when it receives the correct String of data (then, all other clients will not work with the server because they will not send the right information).</p>
<p>for instance, you could program your server so it only starts when the string “Correct_Client” is received. your custom client will then send the String “Correct_Client” to the server, telling it to start.</p>
<p>i’m not sure if i’m going in the right direction with this, so don’t take my word for truth. it could work, though, with some testing. :D[/quote]I honestly Lol’d at everything you said. Can be done, yet the OP is probably an idiot.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>.<br>
Assign your client a certain UID (signlink.java), then in your connect method make it so only clients with a certain ID can connect to the server,</p>
<p><code>
UID = junk; // May or may not be needed. It is included in most winterlove based servers.
if(UID == youruidusedinclient) {
out.write(#);
sendMessage(playerName+" has been logged out due to invalid UID.");
}</code></p>
