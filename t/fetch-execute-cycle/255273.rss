    <title>Fetch-Execute cycle</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fetch-execute-cycle/255273</link>
    <description>Can anyone help me with memorizing this? Apparently we are supposed to know the steps a processor takes to fetch and execute a stored program in my computing class. (Although nobody does...)
 
It&#39;s really fucking confusing. Need to know about program counter, address bus and loads of other stuff :s

              <p>That animated one is pretty good, I think I’ll show my teacher and the rest of the class. I think what is confusing me is the lack of information on how the program counter magically appears to tell the MAR what it wants.</p>
<p>We also have to know the components, I’ll draw them out hang on…<br>

<p>Thats what I copied from the board that my teacher drew, I have no idea what ALU or CIR is(circled in red, not attached to anything because i have no idea what they are, but apparently we have to know about them). Any insight? Also is the diagram all correct?</p>

              <p>David, I explained this to you on IRC a while back,</p>
<p>When the processor fetches and executes an instruction, it makes use of the registers.</p>
<p>The steps that the CPU follows for the assembly language instruction LDA A3 (Load the number at address A3 into the accumulator) are:</p>
<pre><code>1. First, the program counter is read for the address of the next instruction to be executed.
2. The contents of the program counter are copied to the memory address register.
3. The required address in main memory is found, and the contents of that are copied to the memory data register.
4. The program counter is incremented by one, since the old value has already been fetched.
5. The contents of the memory data register are copied to the current instruction register.
6. The instruction in the current instruction register is decoded. The instruction is "load the contents of memory location A3 into the accumulator".
7. "A3" is copied into the memory address register, and the correct memory location is found. The contents of A3 are copied to the memory data register, and then into the accumulator. The instruction has been executed.
8. The program counter is read for the next instruction to be executed...
</code></pre>
<p>edit:<br>
Take a look at this animated Fetch-Execute representaion<br>
