    <description>Hey, Ive Just thought that if im going to release a server i dont want the Owner to be easily Hacked right? Well, That can Happen because of the &quot;SavedGames&quot; File which Contains all the Characters Details Including the Proper Password, Rights, Pc Points, Spec, Jad, Assault, Donator, Skills, Items, Godwars and Loads More! :eek:  This is With all Servers on here but is there any way you can Delete This entire folder to Stop people making themselves Mods/Admins/Owners or Cheating but still be able to save Characters. Also is there any way how you can make it so you only need to run one batch file for the server instead of the source and client? I Have a 562 Server and The Base if Rs2Hd.

Thanks Very Much if you Reply and Thanks even More if it Works.</description>

The server and client are obviously two different Java programs so yes you will need two execute them through two different batch or bash sessions. Though you can Jar the client as it has a frame and graphical user interface, which will package it into one runnable file that won’t open a batch or bash session.<br>
[/quote]Well yeah, but you run the server on your machine, then your players run the client from a jar file. So you’d only be running one in that sense. Why does it really matter?</p>
<p>So ill Always have to Run The Source and Client?[/quote]</p>
