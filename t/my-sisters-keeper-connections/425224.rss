    <title>My Sister&#39;s Keeper connections</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-sisters-keeper-connections/425224</link>
    <description>Basically I&#39;m writting a personal response on &quot;My sister&#39;s Keeper&quot;, I can&#39;t think of any connections related to it. 

Basic summary:

My Sister&#39;s Keeper is about a younger girl created by scientists to serve a purpose as a near perfect match for her sickly older sister. Every time her older sister get&#39;s diagnosed with something she has to donate something. Now she has to donate a kidney to save her sister&#39;s life, but the younger sister doesn&#39;t want to because she if fed up of being treated like a pawn. 

Basically I need 2 media connections for this story, All I can think of is Harry Potter 5&#39;s where &lt;blockquote&gt;the prophecy tells them that neither can live while the other survives.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aside from that I&#39;m stumped.

Anyone got any other connections?

Keep in mind she was forced to donate blood, bone marrows, etc. Which is also forcing her to do things she doesn&#39;t want to do.</description>
