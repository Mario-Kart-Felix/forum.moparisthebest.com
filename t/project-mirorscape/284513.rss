[u][b]Important: 
This server is a 508 server
[/b][/u]

MirorScape will be a Runescape emulated server that looks and works just like Runescape. It has been in development for about 3 months. The Gray Hackerz Team (GHT) has been working on it and so far it has been going very well. But some people stopped and left while others have been working less and less. I have ran out of members of the GHT to help me so now I turn to the greater community of Moparscape. Later I will edit this post and go into more detail but it&#39;s 1:00AM where I&#39;m at and I have a 9:00AM meeting today.

If you would like to join the team please fill out the form below anything with a * is mandatory so if you don&#39;t &quot;have&quot; it, then get it.

Model Editor
Programmer
Environment Programmer
Artist
Game Designer[/code]

Model Editor: Makes the graphics of the game NPCs, Objects, Skins, Items, ETC...
Programmer: Programs the game (obviously) making NPCs, Objects, Skins, Items, and pretty much everything work.
Environment Programmer: No knowledge is needed for this, simply this job is for people to go around the game and place NPC&#39;s and Objects where they are in Runescape.
Artist: Makes graphics such as backgrounds and Titles (Needs to be good with photoshop)
Game Designer: Makes sure everything is being done correctly such as XP rates and placement of NPC&#39;s (Needs to have immense knowledge of Runescape)

Thank you for reading. Like I said more information soon.</description>
