    <title>Ebay question?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ebay-question/261322</link>
    <description>Ive been using a fake name on ebay to buy my stuff using prepaid credit cards, which I paid for. (Im doing this to prevent identity thief or fraud.). I am paying for the items im not using someone elses card or anything but im using a different name. I am using my own address though. I have this question because I need to return something. But I dont want to go in the post office and have them asking questions about why I am a man using a different name to ship something in a different womens name. Is this illegal?</description>

<p>I don’t think they ID you to ship things. Female name might look weird but if they ask its really none of their business. “My mom asked me drop this off while I’m out” etc. When I used to buy [illegal] drugs on the internet, it was always kinda awkward because I know all the people at the post office, they are friends with my mom. They never even asked why I was sending packages (I had to pay by cash in the mail) with someone elses name and they all know my real name.</p>
