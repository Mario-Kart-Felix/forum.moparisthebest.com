<p>-Nearly all servers are leeched and vaguely edited DeltaScape.<br>
-Tutorial section sucks ass. The tutorials are all boring and you’ve got better luck searching on r-s. Go ahead and argue with me, but the staff ruined the forums.<br>
-There’s this section.<br>
-Clients are all the same, and boring.<br>
-Oh, let’s not forget the server advertisement. Due to pure stupidity, you can only advertise on the server status, with the advertisement board still here.</p>
<p>It’s mainly gonna be the staff to argue with my second reason. You just sit and watch. They’re thinking of the forums and not the people, so they can give a shit less if people want it back or not.</p>

Yes, the tutorial section has been ruined. The staff ruin the forum anyway and, there was no point coming back as I guess you’ll leave soon like every good coder in the past.<br>

How was the tutorial section ruined?</p>
