    <description>ok...well i havent really been active at all since the big shutdown of kaitnieks.com..
i doubt mopar, or anyone, remembers me but i was about an average person there with about 200 posts...
i was interested to see where things have gone and i couldnt remember that site that kaitnieks was advertising when he shut down, so i searched for moparisthebest on google :P  anyways, can anyone could tell me briefly what has been goin on with private servers, clients, or any other big events?</description>
