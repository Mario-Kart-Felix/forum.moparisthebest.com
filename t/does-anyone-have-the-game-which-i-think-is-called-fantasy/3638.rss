    <title>Does anyone have the game which i think is called fantasy?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anyone-have-the-game-which-i-think-is-called-fantasy/3638</link>
    <description>after playing an old favourite &quot;jill of the jungle&quot;(thanks paul t and miss silabsoft), i remembered another dos game which i think was called fantasy.
i dont remember much about it but i remember you have a small group of characters, and you can pick from gnomes, warlocks (i think), thiefs, lizard men.. thats all i remember.
but you basically go around fighting monsters and stuff, i remember something about traps, and the thief can steal stuff off enemies.
everyones health is represented by a body, each body part goes from green to yellow to red to gone when damaged.
and if a character dies, on the fighting screen instead of the character theres a headstone.
also i remember something about a gnome bow, the best bow in the game.
and when you get enough exp to level up you pick skills to level.

thats all i can remember about the game for now, but if someone can post it for me so i can play it on XP i would really appreciate it.</description>

              <p>Lol, how do they even find these topics to bump… Do they deliberately click on the 20th page, find a thread and post on it?</p>
<p>Anyway now that it’s bumped, I did find the game. The reason why I couldn’t find it for so long was because it’s spelled “Phantasie”</p>
