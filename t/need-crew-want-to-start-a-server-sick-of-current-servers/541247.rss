The ones that wish to do so could and can if a server like this is made.  The ones who don’t have lower level accounts.  Did any of you have higher level accounts?  I know I didn’t have many 90+stats til after 4 years.  But i never cared if i had my good items to kill people and made good cash from it that’s all that mattered.</p>

<p>I learned by chatting with Reines and writing basic scripts. Eventually picked up a source and have done hardly anything compared to some of the experienced guys that have actually done the real development. It’s a great thing for people to teach others or point them in the right direction.
