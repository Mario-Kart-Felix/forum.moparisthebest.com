    <description>So what the issue is, is, after a certain amount of herbs picked, and seeds planted, the herb stops showing up in the farming patch.
The only way to see it again is to log out and log back in. 

So basically, you plant x amount of seeds and you pick about an inventory full of herbs before the herb stops showing up in the patch.

Only way to continue is to re-log, and ideas what this might be?
Perhaps an anti-bot or an anti-cheat function? I cant seem to detect a reason for this.</description>
