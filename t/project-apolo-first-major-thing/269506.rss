    <title>Project Apolo [First Major Thing]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-apolo-first-major-thing/269506</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been working on a base for quite some time. It&#39;s 382kb. I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t able to keep my goal of 250kb, but I wanted to add My Own Castle War&#39;s and Clan War&#39;s. Since they are so finely done, together they will take up about 350kb.


Completion:

Clan Wars- 17%

Castle Wars- 55%


My current project Is castle wars. I&#39;ve finished so much, but I want to match RuneScape In Development of cW, That Is why I say I&#39;m only done by 55% because there is so much more to add/code to match RuneScape Development 




cW Features:

Wait Timers- 100%

Saradomin/Zamrock Portal- 100%

Flag Taking- 100%

Working Potions/Barracades- 100%

Dungeon run through&#39;s- 75%

Stepping stones- 80%

Taking flag from other player- 99.9% (gotta find glitch)



I will post picture&#39;s When I get Idea&#39;s of the Development Plans. Ideas?</description>

I’m pretty sure you don’t have 100% castle wars. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
