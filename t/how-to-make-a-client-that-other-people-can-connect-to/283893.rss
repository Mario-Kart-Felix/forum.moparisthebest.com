    <description>How can I make a client that works, then give it to someone else and they can connect to the server also?

              <p>… Don’t know how to even edit a client? EGUI.java, Client.java, enter your i.p address, make sure you have portforwarded, and make ur server online, save n compile after u edit i.p address.</p>
