<p>anything is possible and i actually like this  :eek: but anyways check how items are banked the data is stored in char files but check how its stored in the java files look at the void and make somthing similar for pouches and make an int that says you already clicked pouch so when you click it again it gives your items back and resets int also check how items are removed from bank so ppl dont use pouches to dupe</p>

tax bags, a old server i had, had tax bags on it. The concept is that when you put a certain amount of $ into a tax bag it will become 1 of 4 things, Bulging, and like 3 different sizes, but what it does is you sell it to a shop for the amount of money you bought it for :3</p>
