    <title>RuneTopList Voting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runetoplist-voting/551386</link>
    <description>First off, I don&#39;t know if this is the wrong section for this or not, so please, if it is, do not hammer me with comments such as &quot;Wrong section,&quot; or &quot;god noob get a life and learn the sections,&quot; ect ect.. I have set up the runeTopList Voting script, but I have come across a problem. The script makes you put in the website callback for runetoplist, but considering that website is not online anymore, it is impossible. I know there is a way to take off this requirement, I just don&#39;t know how. If anyone could share their knowledge with me that would be excellent, because as of now, whenever my players vote on all of the links, it says &quot;Please vote on all links.&quot; Thanks for any help in advance.  :confused:</description>
