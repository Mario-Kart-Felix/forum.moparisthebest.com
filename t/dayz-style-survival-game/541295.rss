    <title>DayZ style survival game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dayz-style-survival-game/541295</link>
    <description>I love playing the DayZ Standalone alpha on Steam but the game crashes and constant glitching causing death do get to me. I wish to continue learning java programming and figure building a zombie survival game similar to DayZ using RSC would be fun to do. 

For those unfamiliar, DayZ is a game where players must survive the zombie apocalypse. Cans of beans, soda, tuna, shoes, gear, guns, ammo, and all sorts of other things are littered around in various areas for players to collect and consume to stay alive as hunger and thirst slowly drains player health. The game is a first person shooter but each server contains up to 40 players. There are no vehicles and players must hike across the landscape to get places. The further they go, the better item spawns usually. Some are bandits and force feed bleach to handcuffed new spawns (bambis) then shoot them, some are heros and try to help the bambis while fighting the bandits, and some are out there to play the chocolate rain song over the VOIP chat while running through cities in their underwear. Zombies spawn in various locations throughout cities and towns and will aggro when a player gets close enough. They will chase the player for a fairly good distance and are difficult to kill without good weapons. Players can trade items by drop trading only. There are no combat levels or skill levels, only hunger, thirst, disease, and other ailments. Zombies cannot infect players but they can kill them. If hit, a player has a chance of bleeding. If they bleed long enough, they will fall unconscious. Sometimes they wake up and sometimes they die.

[b]Things to do:[/b]

[ul][li][i]Delay the ground item timer significantly to allow dropped items to remain on the ground to remain substantially longer (4 hours instead of 5 minutes) - DONE[/i][/li]
	[li]Set zombie respawns to be 4 hours instead of average 30 seconds[i] (emptied pre-existing database table)[/i][/li]
	[li]Set item spawns to be 4 hours instead of average 120 seconds[i] (emptied pre-existing database table)[/i][/li]
	[li]Create a continent with towns, military bases, and cities[/li]
	[li]Set up the ability to use handcuffs on another player to prevent them from running away[/li]
	[li]Be able to loot other player&#39;s backpacks when they are handcuffed[/li]
	[li]Configure the range style of attack to utilize guns and ammo instead of bows and arrows[/li]
	[li][i]Disable trading and dueling all together - DONE[/i][/li]
	[li][i]Enable global pvp - DONE[/i][/li]
	[li]Create all new sprites for the game client UI, inventory items, ground items, worn items, player bodies, npcs, building walls, and roofs[/li]
	[li]Pack low poly 3D objects into the cache for shelving, cash registers, rubble, old cars[/li]
	[li][i]Set fishing, crafting, fletching, smithing, mining, cooking, and combat all to not gain experience as well as remove level requirements for everything. - DONE[/i][/li][/ul]
Keeping all relevant skills for survival but none will give any experience. Goal is not to level up but instead to gather, create, and fight for resources to survive. Resources will not be easy to obtain. Bots can be killed and stolen from.

All players are set at level 50 in all combat stats and it will not be visible to them, only known through the game mechanics. This lets full power fighting happen immediately. I need to see which is more playable (level 50 or level 99) as when I had level 125 stats in DARScape Classic, the RSC engine was not balanced. The 3 hit system is cool but fights should be difficult to win and take real skill on the player&#39;s behalf.

<p>I have the RSC map maker and could help you build towns on those sectors. But if you wanted to make new sprites (building walls, Roofs) to make those maps with, than I would be no help lol…unless you have some sort of tool that makes these new sprites… Sounds like a fun project and I would definitely play this!  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
