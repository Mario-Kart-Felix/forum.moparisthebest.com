    <description>Where do I edit in my client files to put my server online for others to play? I want to be able to upload it to uppit and have others play it... what do I change? I&#39;m already portforwarded, everything is set, I have a no-ip online, I just need to know where to insert my no-ip URL and how to make the server public for a download client. I need to know what to change in what files in order to put it online so if I upload the client to uppit.com and tell my friend about it, he can download it and also play it. Someone please help me with this step by step?</description>

<li>You cannot rep.</li>
<li>Find your client.java and edit it in there.<br>
The IP should be 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 just edit those.</li>
