    <title>Getting a monster to do 2 attacks, both of them random</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-a-monster-to-do-2-attacks-both-of-them-random/189305</link>
    <description>Title says it all except I&#39;ll explain the both of them random part. What I mean is, whenever the monster attacks, it is random on which attack the monster will do next. Like flipping a coin, head heads tails heads etc. If no one knows this, I would like to know how to make a monster do 2 attacks normally. I am trying to get the ket-Zek to do his mage and melee attack. I have the melee attack but the other attack isn&#39;t working.</description>
