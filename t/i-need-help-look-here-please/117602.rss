    <description>Ok i was trying out hellzend&#39;s client and i decided to go into client.java... i was going to see if i changed the ip from 127.0.0.1 to wakescape.no-ip.org, but when i try to connect i get an error connecting to server can anyone help me so it will connect to my server with-out having a running server running on my computer? 

So basically i want it so i can connect to my server without having to have my server runing on my comp.</description>

              <p>are you serious? dude… okay let me give you a networking lesson.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are two ip adresses that you have. the first is the one between your computer and your router. The other is between your router and the internet. No-ip basicly hides the ip from your router to you internet. So instead of, for example, 67.89.780.645 it would be example.no-ip.info. Understand?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You dont change that in your client.java you change it by going to <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> and getting a host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You dont change the ip address “127.0.0.1” to wakescape.no-ip.info… You change your internet ip. (you can find this out by either going to <a href="http://www.whatsmyip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">www.whatsmyip.org</a> or going to <a href="http://www.no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.no-ip.com</a> and it will be below your email when you login.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last of all… what your requesting is physicly impossible. Because the only way for you to login to your localhost is to have your server running. (if you dont want other people logging in then just dont advertise your internet ip.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And i hope that helps.</p>
