    <title>iTunes being retarded</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/itunes-being-retarded/464891</link>
    <description>Whenever I try to open iTunes, Windows detects an error and it stops working and a little box pops up saying that it has stopped working and I have to close it. Then, iTunes opens up after closing it and the same thing happens over and over again. I have tried just ending the process with Windows Task Manager but it doesn&#39;t affect it. Could anyone tell me what I could do to prevent this?</description>

              <p>You might have a proxy enabled via the control panel, I had that once and didn’t notice it for hours. If not, try uninstalling it an downloading the latest version, that always works for me.</p>
