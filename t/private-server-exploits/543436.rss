[ul]Sinisoul made me dig up some old code I used on projectrs06 so blame him for this thread.

[b]Please do not release dupes with any of the tools provided simply tell the server administrators about the game logic flaw[/b]


[b]Request for exploit searching:[/b]  If you run a 317 economy based server and wish to have it checked for bugs you can post here and I may or may not look at it when I have free time for a few days until I get bored. If you are running a higher revision you will have to wait until I take the time to update the java agent to find the newer packet structures. 


[b]Message to server owners:[/b] I can not speak for others but I myself will not be releasing any found duped items to the masses, if you do fix the problems and want me to come back onto the server to see if they are corrected please feel free to posts here.

[b]List of exploits:[/b]

[li][iurl=#b][s]2006revived - Bank X anywhere in the world[/s] [b]confirmed fixed[/b][/iurl][/li]

[li][iurl=#ep][b]Epicurus - Smith anywhere[/b][/iurl][/li]
[/list]



[b][anchor=a]2006revived - phantom flax picking[/anchor][/b]
This first image it a little misleading because I am abusing 3 issues at once. Not only am I picking flax that has already been taken but I am also banking it directly but lets ignore the banking part and focus directly on the picking issue. When you pick an object such as flax the client sends the server packet 252 in 317

Here we can see I am firing the following packet:

p1isaac(252) // object action packet
isp2(2646) //Y coord
ip2(3442) // X coord
sp2(2750) // flax plant


the issue at hand is that although the server does correctly check if the object is 1 tile from my location it does not check if the object is hidden or visible.

[anchor=b][b]2006revived - requesting to bank X amount of items outside of the bank [/b][/anchor]
When dealing with items servers need to pay special attention to the code so exploits like these are not possible once again 2006revived was the target. Here I am sending the packet to store X amount of flax into the bank. Although the server does check to see if I am using the correct Interface id and have the correct item in the slot it seems to be ignoring the fact that I am not standing at a bank stall.

p1isaac(135) //bank X amount part 1
ip2(0) // inventory slot
sp2(5064) // interface
ip2(1779) // itemId

now many would say &quot;but silab who cares if they can pick phantom flax seems rather useless&quot; but you have to remember in an economy based server event the slightest advantage can have negative effects. In the 10 minutes of making these posts I was able to successfully pick and store this flax:

[anchor=c][b]2006revived - semi bank anywhere with the deposit X function [/b][/anchor]

After being contact by one of the owners who said they fixed the bank anywhere packet I went ahead and tested it. Yes they did fix the blatent abuse of banking anywhere however its still exploitable with packet 208 It just requires a step before you can do it. If I go to a bank and lets say I wanted to deposit some flax I can click deposit X for flax then leave the bank and continue to send Packet 208 anywhere in the world

[b]abusing packet 208 is now confirmed fixed on 2006revived[/b]




[hr]

but that does not mean I&#39;m done having fun!

[anchor=e] [b]Casting combat spells on items [/b][/anchor]
I was granted temporary magic experience and items to play around with the magic system

p1isaac(237,) //use magic on item
p2(9,) // item slot
sp2(300,) // item id
p2(3214,) // interface id
sp2(1178,) //highalch spell

The above packet structure is what the client sends to the server when you highalch an item but what happens if we change that to lets say earth blast?



p1isaac(237)
p2(9)
sp2(995)
p2(3214)
sp2(1188) // earth blast spell

[img]http://i.imgur.com/wlHKRd5.png[/img]

no it does not destroy my item with 14 spell damage but what does happen is because the projectile has nowhere to travel i get credited with the spell experience and the cooldown is near 0 giving me easy access to rapid experience.

[anchor=f]Divine Reality - Accepting negative numbers for Amount X packet [/anchor]


Terrible things happen when a server accepts a negative value for Input X

<p>im pretty sure i’ve said this before but the isaac cipher class can be easily found by searching for a class with 2 integer arrays with the length of 256; as for the “client” class depending on which revision as 459+ you no longer hook the class with the run thread you can easily identify it as the one that extends the gameshell class and has a import for applet context. However I have to say if you are only planning on using the tool for exploiting random servers you will quickly become bored as most of the servers share common bases and you will be able to quickly identify which exploits work and which don’t for pretty much any server in existence.</p>

</aside>
<p>Thanks for help , and about the isacc , its not easy becuase i think its not in stream file right? you can fonund it!<br>
you need to search all files that have 256; length and that take much time ,</p>
<p>And about exploits , i am just learning and now i have ideas alot , i just get the config.js nearreality now and i am starting to find Exploits and yes about this !<br>
stream.p1isaac(103); //opcode<br>
stream.p1(61); // length<br>
stream.pjstr(“changepassword abc123\r[CHARACTER]\rcharacter-rights = 3\r[EOF]”); //Command</p>
<p>i dont know if you ever test it ? its almost work on all [pi] server if its not patched !</p>
<p>i hope you reply :d</p>

</aside>
<p>That wouldn’t work on Near Reality because that’s not how we store passwords. I’m one of the two developers for this server so if you do come across exploits<br>
I’d prefer you report them to me instead of fuel your own desires. I’m more than capable of reimbursing you anyways.</p>

you need to search all files that have 256; length and that take much time ,</p>

With how desperate you’re being, I honestly cannot think that you’re using this tool for it’s “intended purposes”. That being said…<br>
Silab and others have released tutorials on it… You should take a look on her website.</p>
<p>Here’s a tip: The Client_Class_name is the name of the Clients main class…</p>
<p>Don’t know what a main class is? You may want to read up on java more, as that’s one of your first things you learn.</p>

<p>My most recent find was with shopping:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">stream.p1isaac(117)// Packet
stream.isp2(3900)// Interface/Frame
stream.isp2(3511)// Item
stream.ip2(1)// Slot</code></pre>
<p>So if you go into a shop and buy an item, you’d notice it prints out the packet as above (buy 1 item). On the average 317, however, they don’t check if the slot you’re buying from. Meaning if a server sold 500k runes in slot 0, but only 1 abyssal whip in slot 10, you could do:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">stream.p1isaac(117)// Packet
stream.isp2(3900)// Interface/Frame
stream.isp2(4151)// Item
stream.ip2(0)// Slot</code></pre>
<p>And you could buy 500k abyssal whips. Only downside: it doesn’t cost the price of the item in the slot. So no whips for 1gp.</p>

<p>Is there no way to pack a stream class with the tool and simply make it latch onto the existing buffer? That way we wouldn’t need to find out the individual method names</p>

<p>How would you manage that… Even if you did pack a stream class so you didn’t have to get the names, how would you make the client use that stream class instead of the one it’s already using. This way it’s piggybacking off the already existing data…</p>
