    <title>Problem with starter</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-starter/240876</link>
    <description>OK so im using defaultscape  so that i wont have to mess around with alot of stuff. But i tried to add a starter, the command works perfectly. The starter i added give the right items, the right amount, and all that i want it to. The only thing that is wrong with it is that all i have to do to get another starter is log off and then do the command again.

Here is the code im using
[code]        if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;starter&quot;)) {	
            if (starter == 0) {
                addItem(995, 25000000);
                addItem(392, 1500);
                addItem(6528, 1);
                addItem(554, 2000);
                addItem(555, 2000);
                addItem(565, 2000);
                addItem(556, 2000);
                addItem(557, 2000);
                addItem(560, 2000);
                addItem(561, 2000);
                addItem(562, 2000);
                addItem(563, 2000);
                addItem(566, 2000);
                addItem(558, 2000);
                sendMessage(&quot;Totalpkscape Starter Package&quot;);
                starter = 1;
                savemoreinfo();
                savechar();
            } else if (starter == 1) {
                sendMessage(&quot;Sorry &quot; + playerName + &quot;, but...&quot;);
                PlayerHandler.messageToAll = (playerName
                        + &quot; needs to be kicked for trying to get an extra starter :p&quot;);

            }
        }[/code]
