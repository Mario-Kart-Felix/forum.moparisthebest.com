    <description>Hey i was wondering if i could get someone to do some Tutorials for me. Even though they are supposed to be simple, they completely throw me off. If you could be assed to help me out it would be great. If you have msn or something i could send you my client + whatever files you require to be able to help. Thanks for reading. Try not to flame me.  :)[br][size=1]Posted on: May 12, 2007, 02:43:09 PM[/size][hr]Guessing no 1. :(</description>

              <p>The tutorials are really simple. We can’t do every tutorial for you. Just follow the steps and you’ll do fine. Why are the tutorials so confusing anyway?</p>
