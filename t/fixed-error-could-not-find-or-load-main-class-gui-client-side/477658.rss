    <title>FIXED! Error: Could not find or load main class Gui (Client Side)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixed-error-could-not-find-or-load-main-class-gui-client-side/477658</link>
    <description>Hello,
I just got a new computer and want to continue developing my server on it. I took the servers files off my other computer and put them on this one, changed the Run.bat to my newest version of Java (i will put code below) and i get this error. &quot;Error: Could not find or load main class Gui&quot;
I have recompiled,and yes, i have a class and java of Gui.
Also, when i put the files back on my old computer, they loaded and worked perfectly.
Any help is appreciated
Thank you in advance.

[code]@echo off
title Client
cd ./Class/
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\java.exe&quot; -Xmx500m Gui 30 0 lowmem members 32
pause
[/code]

EDIT:
The webclient that I made loads perfectly fine on my new computer, but it still will not load the run.bat

EDIT 2
i fixed it. add &quot;-cp .;&quot; without the quotations before the Gui part of your run.bat
ex:
[code]title Client
cd ./Class/
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\java.exe&quot; -Xmx500m -cp .; Gui 30 0 lowmem members 32
pause[/code]</description>
