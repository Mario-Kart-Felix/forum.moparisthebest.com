<p>You can run a server on a VPS exactly how you run it on your computer. VIA eclipse, commandline, or etc.<br>
I’ve made a Run.bat generator (Not 100% done sadly) you can use located <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31065410/DoNotDelete/CompilerGenerator.jar" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Download a few pi sources and take the run.bat codes from them. Also just a helpful tip if you plan on pumping a ton of updates for your server out very soon do not buy a vps until you have a lot of it done because it will annoy the players.</p>

<p>Sadly, you’re mistaken. While people do not like being booted off their game (any game, really), they do like to know there are updates being done to it. RuneScape wouldn’t exist if they followed your idea. to “do all the work before” and release little to nothing after. As long as you get the majority of the typical updates done first, you shouldn’t have to worry about pushing updates. Also don’t be like some server owners, who <span class="bbcode-b">write code on the live copy (Aka the copy on the VPS)</span> and then update it that way. That can lead to your server taking a shit, mad players, and you without an explanation. Make sure you have a local copy (like on your own machine) that you can do testing and programming on. Only after it works there, would you send the update to the vps.</p>
