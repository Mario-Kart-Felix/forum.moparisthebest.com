    <title>The other idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-other-idea/399995</link>
    <description>Alright, so I&#39;m not a huge fan of the new plugin. But I think there is another way. Currently on a survival server it isn&#39;t that hard to survive all you need to do is mine a few blocks, gain access to coal and you&#39;re safe.

But I think this should be made harder. It can include:

The readding of creeper explosions
Possible increased spawn rate
etc...

This way it would just be like on the first map, people would work together and help each other instead of killing each other all the time to gain immense wealth. This would of course lead to the possible deactivation of Pvp. 

Some may argue a map reset would be in order, but it is still possible to be done if we all move close to each other.

Opinions?

EDIT: Added a poll.</description>

              <p>Re-adding creeper explosions is no problem and can be done easily (but keep in mind, if it is used to grief by luring or something else, it can’t be un-done by big brother).</p>
<p>I don’t know what if anything can be done about the spawn rate or difficulty, but I certainly wouldn’t mind looking into it.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/the">@The</a> map reset, you all know I promised I wouldn’t do this again, but I wouldn’t mind moving the spawn point someplace far off, and even enabling /spawn for a time so that people who want to can meet up to do whatever you want.</p>
<p>Are you also talking about disabling PvP?  I tend to prefer maybe allowing people who want to use the residency plugin to disable PvP in their own towns, so that towns can optionally become ‘pvp free zones’, and the rest would be like the wilderness.

<p>So basically, I wouldn’t mind doing the first few things, but I also think PvP and the residency plugin is a good idea.  (PS.  People don’t live far away from each other because PvP is enabled, they do it because of the griefers, which residency would stop)</p>

<p>Now you’re acting like a 5 year old, having an excuse all of the time. What the difference between buildings and items? Aren’t they made from those items? When you steal from someone you’re technically stealing a building because they can no longer build that building. Yes, MITB said no more map resets, we ALL understand that. Frankly, what you need to understand is that we need to be a community instead of living 2.147 billion blocks away from each other.[/quote]<br>
You overlook what we steal. When I go up to a chest, I take anything I find that’s over iron, stackable food, or wood. If I take anything else, it’s because I killed someone and they dropped those items. We built two rather impressive structures, using over 4000 glass. And do you know how much of that we stole? Maybe 2 stacks of sand. That’s only 128, not even 5%. And I moved away because I was tired of my house being burned down, because some members of this community find it rather amusing to pour lava onto ones house.</p>

Sick of losing your stuff? How hypocritical. You’ve been stealing from other people through “raids” and those people are “losing their shit”. Now you’re mad it could happen to you?</p>
