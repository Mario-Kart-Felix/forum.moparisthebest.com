    <description>Can somone teach me how to create handlers for a Czar/Allstar based 317?
I have a teamviewer if needed. 
And one more thing, I added a code (quite a bit a go) to do ::bank it worked perfectly until recently when it would lagg and restart you. Id look on the server cmd and it say index out of range -1 and all that other code following. Can i get help on that too?</description>
