    <title>I need a server - a very specific server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-server-a-very-specific-server/271926</link>
    <description>OK, here goes.

I need a server that&#39;s code-able (YES that&#39;s a word) but not too in-depth.

I need a server that starts out as just a blank server - I tried allstar-scape but that has loads of pre-defined stuff.

At the moment I use TestScape. For some reason it doesn&#39;t have a method to spawn objects. I need something that can.

Any suggestions? Any help would be appreciated.

[i]Mods, admins and anyone else who has any sort of power over me whatsoever, and possibly the ability to make me perish in a fiery hell - please move this if it&#39;s in the wrong parking spot.[/i]</description>
