    <description>[b][size=40pt]Project 377 Alpha[/size][/b]

Well, Project 377 alpha will be the the first [b]Public 377 Server[/b], it Will be one of the most 
basic servers ever constructed, only allowing you to walk. You will have to add every other 
function yourself. If you are not good with java, and or only know how to code pservers, 
this server isn&#39;t for you.

Remember, I have to go to school 10 hrs a day, so i will have limited time per day to work on this.

The Server will only be compatible with the 377 Client. Allowing full functionality with the client.
It will have a different interface than the modified 317s.

The Server will consist of Three parts.

[b] Part One: [/b]
Update Server, You can&#39;t fully bypass the server, so i am just rebuilding it.
[b] Part Two: [/b]
Sql, This is the servers main functionality, Consisting of classes such as &quot;client...etc..etc.&quot;
[b] Part Three: [/b]
The Configuration and the User database goes here, The configuration files are essential for the creation of stores.

I will use 3 coders, and 4 Testers, Depending on your java knowledge, I will give you a test to see if your elligable for the spot.
