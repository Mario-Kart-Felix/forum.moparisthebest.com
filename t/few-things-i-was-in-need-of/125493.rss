    <title>Few things I was in need of</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-things-i-was-in-need-of/125493</link>
    <description>I was wondering how I would make my own graphics/maps/characters, and how I would implement them into my game. Also, What should I do for making a client that will hold the game? How big should it be and crap?




Any help is appreciated, I really need to model maker thing and ways to put them into the game.


Thanks,
Adam</description>

</aside>
<p>Thats very simple.<br>
Just create a new ServerSocket and a Socket to accept clients for the server and a Socket client side to chekc for connections.<br>
Than just make it write methods that are interpreted by the client and server or write them to a Interface and implement it in both classes along with importing them.</p>

<p>All that depend on what you want your game to be like. When I mess around with 2d drawing, I usually use older sprites found from older gbc games and old RPG Makers.</p>

<p>You want to make a game that connects to a server right?<br>
Learn WinSock or WinSock2.<br>
Because there would be no reason for characters if it wasn’t a game and I believe you were making a Server game.<br>
For the pictures - Use paint method.<br>
Package Java.AWT I believe.</p>
