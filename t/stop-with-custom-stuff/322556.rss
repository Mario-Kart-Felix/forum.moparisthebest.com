    <title>Stop with custom stuff!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stop-with-custom-stuff/322556</link>
    <description>Stop posting your custom interfaces, emotes, or GFX&#39;s.


We have the meaning 317 because we use to not have custom weapons and armor, and we didn&#39;t have custom emotes.



By adding custom items and emotes and GFX&#39;S to your client, your taking up space.  Clients that are without custom interfaces, custom items and emotes can be as little as 15MB.


I see clients now that are 30MB-60MB.




If you truely want d claws then make a 525+

If you want godwars then use a 474+...

This is becoming just BS how people keep addin g useless junk to their server.  People call it &quot;keeping up to date&quot;, yet turning the good old days into runescape 2008 is just dumb.



I know Lin posted about this a little while ago with the interface problem, but this is getting way to out of hand.  Do you really think your players like downloading 40MB+ files every time you add a new item or emote?  I sure wouldn&#39;t.






So please...Stop wqith the damn custom stuff, it&#39;s becom ing to much of a problem.  Save your clients usage and player happiness.</description>

<p>It just adds a little “Spice” to your server.<br>

<p>Most do it just for something different, and especially if they designed that custom. It’s question awesome to see a piece of your own work in a game.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure you just got done saying it’s better to add in the cache than in the client.<br>

Yes custom are fine if they are in the cache. All custom items can be pack to obj.dat and obj.idx, those can be replaced in the cache with tom’s suite then you will have all you item’s without the ints in Class8. Understand?</p>

              <p>Kid, just go, you dont realise that some people dont want to make 525’s because simply it is not the WL setup. When someone makes a WL setup into a 525 then yes, more people will make it, but until then, no, they will keep updating there clients as they please. What you dont realise is the more customised the client is so the game-play is away from RS, the less they can go after us on.</p>

<p>We have the meaning 317 because we use to not have custom weapons and armor, and we didn’t have custom emotes.</p>
<p>By adding custom items and emotes and GFX’S to your client, your taking up space.  Clients that are without custom interfaces, custom items and emotes can be as little as 15MB.</p>
<p>I see clients now that are 30MB-60MB.</p>
<p>If you truely want d claws then make a 525+</p>
<p>If you want godwars then use a 474+…</p>
<p>This is becoming just BS how people keep addin g useless junk to their server.  People call it “keeping up to date”, yet turning the good old days into runescape 2008 is just dumb.</p>
<p>I know Lin posted about this a little while ago with the interface problem, but this is getting way to out of hand.  Do you really think your players like downloading 40MB+ files every time you add a new item or emote?  I sure wouldn’t.</p>
<p>So please…Stop wqith the damn custom stuff, it’s becom ing to much of a problem.  Save your clients usage and player happiness.</p>
