    <description>Hey, so first off.. I was playing around in my src\com\rs\game folder, trying to get rid of some of the things i accidentally changed that i shouldnt have.. When i had like 8 errors in my source&#39;s compiler.. So i couldnt fix them so i just got the source files that i downloaded first off and just replaced the ones showing errors, and now here is some errors that come up..
Im not to sure why they are there, they are the exact same files as were there when i first downloaded and they didnt show any errors then..

And also, in my client side, I get these errors when i compile. Not sure how to fix here either.

Any help on either of the two would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks a bunch.


EDIT: 
I realised that none of those are actually errors, the first one said &quot;compiled succesfully&quot; and the second are just warnings... 
I have also portforwarded and made a jar file for my client and downloaded it on my other computer but when i changed the ip in the source the compiler didnt work so that is probably why i couldnt connect on my computer downstairs..
But does it matter if the compilers say warning and show the stuff even tho they arent errors?

Thanks again.</description>

<p>Ok, so I got rid of the null’s that were causing the errors… this is all I get now.</p>

<p>And thats for the second one.  The first one i didnt do anything, because there are no errors, so I think it works to compile.</p>
<p>So basically im asking if the code I just posted is good? and same with the first one in he main post.</p>
