[b]READ THIS:[/b] [i]Sometimes in Matrix releases the screen is black at the first login, simply restart your client &amp; it will be gone.
this is a one-off thing. And won&#39;t happen to you again.[/i]

[size=14pt][b]What is the idea of this game, what makes it unique?[/b][/size][size=1em]
It&#39;s been 10 years, you&#39;ve been in jail since 2003 and your punishment is nearly complete. 
Since you were leader of the rebellion, everyone saw you as a respected leader; But during your prison years lots of them have been forgotten your name.

[/size][size=18pt][b]Prisonerz Trailer #1[/b][/size][size=1em]
[youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEwg2ATxRqk[/youtube]

[b][i]You got released out of prison.[/i] [/b]But on one condition; The human rights you always had, will be gone. Your respected leader title has been fallen, and is changed to a slaves one. but there&#39;s hope, you can train &amp; master your skills again, show people that the respected person you always were has been returned.

[/size][size=18pt][b]Starting up your life again.[/b][/size][size=1em]
There you are, on an island in between Karamja and Al Kharid: ♯Sʟᴀᴠᴇ Isʟᴀɴᴅ♯ which 
contains only the most fearest prison in ☬ Prisonerz ☬.

[b]A Dangerous World.[/b]
Ever seen the movie Django Unchained? it has the same idea: 
The world is tough, like in real life; you can attack anyone, anywhere you are: 
But this could have consequences, like if the security (players with a higher rank) ever will spot this,
you&#39;ll have to deal with punishments.


[b]Forms of Danger.[/b]
Like in the wild-west, there are people hired by other people to kill a specific player: Bᴏᴜɴᴛʏ Hᴜɴᴛᴇʀs
Bounty Hunters, are risking their freedom and are most wanted criminals in-game.

<li>Not to piss people off? The logout button is right there mate. We could use less of these disrespectful kids such as yourself.</li>
<li>Yes, I’ll take a “cab” (taxi) from Scotland, right over the water and to mexico just for you.</li>

<p>This server is not good. The staff is abusive and the players rage and flame, and threaten to hack your computer. The owner doesn’t even develop and abuses her power. Teleports players into the wilderness and kills them. They player base of 3-4 players are hateful and negative. And today I won 200m from a squal of fortune spin. They automatically say I duped the server, or hacked etc. And attempted to kill me. This server is now worth what it looks. It’s shit, abusive staff. And unfriendly players. I do not recommend this server.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, anything else to say sir? May I please explain to you why “these hateful players” are possible sayin’ that?<br>
First of all, the hell with the 200m you won. SOF is disabled all over the server, and there’s absolutely no way<br>
of gettin’ it. Now you’re saying players, <span class="bbcode-b">TREATHEN</span> to hack your computer? Wow… be original next time. And<br>
Third above all. The owner you’ve seen, is a an “owner” yes she has right to do whatever the hell she wants,<br>
but I can guarantee you: She’s ain’t abusing anything. She is the most trusted and mature person I know. Maybe you, should try to learn somethin’ from her next time. Instead of just calling it “abusive”. Also, if you checked out the rankings, you my friend, could have seen, that she is only the owner, not the developer buddy. I am. The hell with you, the server is just up for a couple days: you can’t expect a big server at all. We treat our players like brothers, be rude to them and learn<br>
to handle the consequences. There are enough players who can verify the staff is good to the players, and I am definitely gonna keep it like that.</p>

<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">What is the idea of this game, what makes it unique?</span>[/size][size=1em]<br>
It’s been 10 years, you’ve been in jail since 2003 and your punishment is nearly complete.<br>
Since you were leader of the rebellion, everyone saw you as a respected leader; But during your prison years lots of them have been forgotten your name.</p>
<p>[/size][size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Prisonerz Trailer <span class="hashtag">#1</span></span>[/size][size=1em]<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">You got released out of prison.</span> </span>But on one condition; The human rights you always had, will be gone. Your respected leader title has been fallen, and is changed to a slaves one. but there’s hope, you can train &amp; master your skills again, show people that the respected person you always were has been returned.</p>
<p>[/size][size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Starting up your life again.</span>[/size][size=1em]<br>
There you are, on an island in between Karamja and Al Kharid: ♯Sʟᴀᴠᴇ Isʟᴀɴᴅ♯ which<br>
contains only the most fearest prison in ☬ Prisonerz ☬.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">A Dangerous World.</span><br>
Ever seen the movie Django Unchained? it has the same idea:<br>
The world is tough, like in real life; you can attack anyone, anywhere you are:<br>
But this could have consequences, like if the security (players with a higher rank) ever will spot this,<br>
you’ll have to deal with punishments.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Forms of Danger.</span><br>
Like in the wild-west, there are people hired by other people to kill a specific player: Bᴏᴜɴᴛʏ Hᴜɴᴛᴇʀs<br>
Bounty Hunters, are risking their freedom and are most wanted criminals in-game.</p>
