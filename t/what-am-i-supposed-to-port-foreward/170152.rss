    <title>What am I supposed to port foreward?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-am-i-supposed-to-port-foreward/170152</link>
    <description>OK I have port forewarded before and I did it a few days ago, but I got a new computer so its all diffrent and I guess I didn&#39;t port foreward right. Do I portforewad my routers IP or the IP 192.168.******?And here is a pic of windows firewall:[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/7557/wfireho1.jpg[/img][/URL]
So don&#39;t say &quot;Oh just go to exceptions!&quot; because it doesn&#39;t have that...so where would I add port 43594 because I don&#39;t have it, thats why I posted the firewall</description>

you have to log into the router with the router’s IP which is generally 192.168.1.1, then go from there. There are <span class="bbcode-b">MANY</span> port forwarding guides around here (dunno why no one can do it, its a snap).<br>
[/quote]<br>
Lol I <span class="bbcode-b">HAVE</span> port forewarded before, but it was a while ago and I never bothered to look at it. My routers IP is 192.160.0.1 but I portforewarded 192.168.0.100…so which do I portforeward? I did the router…and I don’t think I can add port 43594 because windows firewall is gay…[/quote]</p>
<p>You need to portforward 192.168.0.100, and do you have vista? if you do you should throw your computer away and buy xp.</p>

              <p>You use yr routers ip, to find out what that is:</p>
<p>Start&gt;Run&gt;cmd&gt;Type in ipconfig and press enter&gt; It should be in there. But that might just be the 192.168.****</p>
<p>EDIT: Yeah it only does default… Sorry.</p>
