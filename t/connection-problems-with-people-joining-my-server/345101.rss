    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-problems-with-people-joining-my-server/345101</link>
    <description>Okay, so heres what happens. I run my server. People connect. It says something about Null disconnects. Also, It sometimes disconnects me and says &quot;your account is already logged in&quot; blahblah and it stays like that for about 30 seconds. And it says something about Invalid server. I cant post pictures because i&#39;m on windows 5 and cant screenshot anything.</description>
