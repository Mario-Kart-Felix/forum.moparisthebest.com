    <title>Some simple newb help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-simple-newb-help/79911</link>
    <description>Well lol, I have my own server (new to server building), and it works + running right now. But, I want to edit some files such as client.java, player.java, npc.java, and NPChandler.java. Well why these files? Is probably what you&#39;re thinking. I&#39;m trying to add the Jad Mini-Game to my server (http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,93492.0.html) so for example, in the client.java file, do I put it anywhere? Or at the end of a command? And I need to know EXACTLY where to put the coding. Thanks if you guys can help me out.</description>
