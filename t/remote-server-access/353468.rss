    <description>Hi,
I have a testscape server setup, and I am using no-ip.  I can connect to it locally on pc my server is running on, but I cannot remotely connect from any of my other computers. I configured my router, and even removed it and hardwired straight into my cable model, to be sure it wasn&#39;t anything with that, but I still cannot successfully connect remotely.  When I login remotely, I do see it hit my server, then after a few seconds I get a disconnected message.  It looks like this:

Starting testscape Server on 0.0.0.0:43594
ClientHandler: Accepted from c-24-3-166-108.hsd1.pa.comcast.net:4272
Client type: high memory version
UserId: 26340443
wood1master7 has signed onto server.
Game saved for player wood1master7
ClientHandler: Client wood1master7 disconnected from testscape.

Any help on what may be causing this would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.</description>

              <p>How do I run it normally?  I didn’t know I had different options in running the server.<br>
I want this to run online for all, but I don’t know what I have to do differently.<br>
