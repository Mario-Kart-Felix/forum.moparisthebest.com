    <title>[PI] EquipmentEditor.jar messes up? [Rep++]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-equipmenteditor-jar-messes-up-rep/363514</link>
    <description>I used EquipmentEditor.jar to change my custom items into leg pieces and when I do that, it seems the legs are really legs, but it stays under the weapon and above the glvoe area, so it became an extra piece of items. Any idea what went wrong?</description>
