    <description>Have a few problems with my server.

Two of the easier problems are this server didn&#39;t come with a working noclip command or a empty command.I tried looking on the internet and even in other servers but couldn&#39;t find either. If anybody has working commands for those they could post I would appreciate it.

Also, when I drop an item on my server, it doesn&#39;t appear on the ground. I would like to make it where dropped items show up on the ground, and if anybody knows how to, make it so after a certain price of an item it disappears after being dropped or the server does not let you drop it.

Hope everything I typed made sense and thanks in advanced.

EDIT: How would I remove the random event thing that pops up and tells you to choose a certain skill? It is very annoying.</description>

also just search for drop and see what you’ll get.</p>
