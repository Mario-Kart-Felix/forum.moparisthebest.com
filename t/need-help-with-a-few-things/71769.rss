    <description>[b][size=14pt]Need Help With A Few Things...[/size][/b]

1. I want to add mineable rocks with a level requirement and an item requirement such as a pickaxe. I already added the global objects tut so I&#39;m almost there.

2. Need to know how to make NPC&#39;s such as Jad hit higher than 2... I want him to hit more like 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s rather than 1&#39;s and 2&#39;s.

Actually that&#39;s it for now.. Please send me links for tut or tell me how to here.. I&#39;ll be checking back.</description>
