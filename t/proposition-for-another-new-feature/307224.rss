    <title>Proposition For Another New Feature</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/proposition-for-another-new-feature/307224</link>
    <description>Well since we&#39;re posting all these great suggestions that aren&#39;t ever going to be addressed, I figure I might as well add another to the list: thread-level moderation.

There should be privileges for people (or better yet, certain people, like CMs) who create threads that allow them to delete posts of others that are intentionally spam. Deletion would result in a small message left in its place stating that it was deleted by the OP, and a reason for deletion (which would be mandatory) would be listed. Obviously moderators would still be able to see the deleted posts, which would make the thread authors liable for their actions. Another feature could be added to prevent deleting really old posts; if the post is older than 2 weeks, for example, then it cannot be deleted by a thread author, because it is assumed he has had more than enough time to review it and determine its relevancy. This, obviously, would serve to prevent abuse on buried threads.

Ultimately the idea is to help move the burden of monitoring dumbass posts that people constantly make from moderators (who really don&#39;t give a shit) to thread authors (who actually do).

Go ahead and discuss, but [b]please don&#39;t troll[/b]. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s a feature that lets me force you assholes stay on topic.</description>

As I said on the IRC, this feature will lead to certain groups being able to freely moderate any topic they want, without regulation. This won’t lead to forum control, but rather to forum anarchy.<br>

<p>What I read from Mopmans post, was not fear of abuse. Or lack of trust. But more along the lines of how few people there are that would be in the usergroup in the first place. The amount of regular topic posters is minimal. And the amount of actual worthwhile topics is even smaller. We might see maybe 9 or 10 people tops get this ability. And considering how few that number is, they would be better suited as sectional moderators.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>even if we ignore the fact that that number is probably grossly underestimated, so what? if 10 people benefit then it will be worth it, because it doesn’t take much work to install (it already exists) and it actually helps relieve the burden of moderating from the moderators. that was one of the main points, try to follow along.</p>
<p>besides, hiding posts is much better than the shitty warning system that is already in place, both short and long term. if your posts get constantly hidden from everyone else because you’re always acting like a fucktard, then you’re probably going to either A) stop being a fucktard, or B) stop wasting your time posting like one.</p>

<p>“owning” it is taking a little far, wouldn’t you say? it exists on moparisthebest’s server, and he has complete control over its content and display. i don’t think giving a thread author some amount of added control is absurd, considering the fact that the content and subject is (usually) the author’s own creation. i mean, we don’t <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> to contribute…</p>

</aside>
<p>what the fuck, are you kidding me? i thought it was obvious that not only do you need trust to become a mod, you also need to care. i don’t give a fuck about other people’s threads (well, i sort of do if there’s spam, but not enough to remove it myself).</p>
<p>the real problem you have with this is that moderators should be the ones removing spam. but guess what, none of your moderators removed the 10 fucking posts of spam in this thread until i reported them all. this forum even has a report feature, which admits the fact that moderators can’t always see where people are spamming or breaking the rules. this feature is merely an admission that moderators can’t spot and remove spam <span class="bbcode-i">fast enough</span>.</p>
<p>now unless you’re going to remove all the posts i report immediately after i report them, let’s move past the discussion of whether or not this is a good idea. because it’s pretty obvious it is.</p>

if we trust these people enough why are they not mods<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>That is the issue I am starting to see. :/[/quote]<br>
but you are only trusting them to watch over their own thread, and if they do make stupid decisions doing it ie removing legit posts because they dont like the person then just remove their thread moderating priveallage, its not as if they can warn/moderate/mute so no real reprecussions will come of it</p>
