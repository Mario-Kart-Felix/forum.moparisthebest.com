    <description>Our beloved grandparents always have some fantastic stories to tell and I was talking to the sole remaining grandfather I have today. He was telling me about this one fond memory he had of my grandmother and I found it sort of funny. 

if you have any fond stories you wish to share feel free to as well.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Emmie Nichols was in the living room knitting with her mother when her father came in and asked for her and her eldest brother to fetch the bottles from the woodshed. 

Now, not many people knew this, but Mr. Nichols was a moonshiner. He did it as more of a general hobby then as a business. It was a tradition that was brought down from generation to generation as a Nichols.

So off the two children went to the woods. On the way back, with bottles and all in their wooden holsters they were walking back up the path when the county sheriff and his faithful deputy pulled to the  side of the road. Now the Nichols lived in a small one story house with only four rooms. The house lived on the corner of a road so the police stopped their car on the side of the house and saw the two children walked towards the house wielding wooden boxes with something in them.

The sheriff walked over to the two children while heading to the house. He smiled at the children and tipped his hat in greeting.

&quot;Mornin&#39; Emmie, your pa at home.&quot; 

&quot;Yes sir Mr. Barnes. He&#39;s be in the living room with Ma.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you Emmi...what you be holding there gal?&quot;

&quot;Oh this be my pa&#39;s moonshine Mr. Barnes sir. Pa asked me to take it to him for tonight deliveries.&quot;

&quot;Did he now? Well have a nice day little Emmie.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Long story short, my great granddad got ratted on by my grandmother for moonshining without even knowing it back in the 1940&#39;s. From what I was also told he never did really forgive her for that as he spent several years in jail for it.</description>

              <p>My grandma was telling me a story not to long ago about my grandfather. (He passed away when I was 3) Anyway, he used to work in a paper-mill, and one day he came across 650$ on the ground. Of course he did the right thing and tried to find out who it belonged to, assuming it was someone he worked with. Well, it turned out it was his bosses money and he got a promotion.</p>
<p>Was this story interesting? No. I don’t have any outstanding stories to share, although I wish I did. I have a pretty boring family.</p>

              <p>My mom and Grandma were telling me a story about something that happened to us a long time ago.  We were going to get something for my cousins birthday party, (it was late at night), and the store we were going to was about to close.  We went in the first doors, then they locked and the ones in front of us locked so we were stuck in the entrance to this store all night long.  At one point, there was a janitor on one of the floor waxers that you drive in, but he had ear buds in so he couldn’t hear everyone screaming at him to open the doors.  I was too young to remember it, but it was pretty funny when they were telling it to me.</p>

              <p>Our beloved grandparents always have some fantastic stories to tell and I was talking to the sole remaining grandfather I have today. He was telling me about this one fond memory he had of my grandmother and I found it sort of funny.</p>
<p>if you have any fond stories you wish to share feel free to as well.</p>
<blockquote>Emmie Nichols was in the living room knitting with her mother when her father came in and asked for her and her eldest brother to fetch the bottles from the woodshed. 
<p>Now, not many people knew this, but Mr. Nichols was a moonshiner. He did it as more of a general hobby then as a business. It was a tradition that was brought down from generation to generation as a Nichols.</p>
<p>So off the two children went to the woods. On the way back, with bottles and all in their wooden holsters they were walking back up the path when the county sheriff and his faithful deputy pulled to the  side of the road. Now the Nichols lived in a small one story house with only four rooms. The house lived on the corner of a road so the police stopped their car on the side of the house and saw the two children walked towards the house wielding wooden boxes with something in them.</p>
<p>The sheriff walked over to the two children while heading to the house. He smiled at the children and tipped his hat in greeting.</p>
<p>“Mornin’ Emmie, your pa at home.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir Mr. Barnes. He’s be in the living room with Ma.”</p>
<p>“Thank you Emmi…what you be holding there gal?”</p>
<p>“Oh this be my pa’s moonshine Mr. Barnes sir. Pa asked me to take it to him for tonight deliveries.”</p>
<p>“Did he now? Well have a nice day little Emmie.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long story short, my great granddad got ratted on by my grandmother for moonshining without even knowing it back in the 1940’s. From what I was also told he never did really forgive her for that as he spent several years in jail for it.</p>
