    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs2-server-advertisements-should-be-approved-by-a-moderator-and/446059</link>
    <description>I say that the RS2 Server Advertisements should be approved by a moderator for many reasons. Most reasons match [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,546726.0.html]Jmood&#39;s[/url] post. Others are also...


[ul][li]Neatness[/li][/ul]

Neatness is a factor we need to improve in our RS2 Server Advertisement section. I find 95% of the topics not neat or so. Can you take a look at http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,548786.0.html? Look at that horrid looking advertisement. If new members see it, people will think we aren&#39;t organized, and our reputation from our members will go down.

[ul][li]We SHOULD add a post count requirement[/li][/ul]

I suggest we add a post count requirement (like at least 20 - 50 posts) to prevent our members from viruses. I suggest the same for the downloads section.

I hope you take time to improve this.</description>

It’s difficult for moderators alone to make thorough decisions on each and every server. You’re essentially requesting that we spend all of our time moderating a new and hardly active advertisements forum, when the much more active server status page has next to no moderation. That page has been around longer than I have and it has worked for that long. The old server advertisements board worked just as well on its own. If an advertisement leads to malicious content, our mods will take care of it as soon as it’s detected by them or another member.</p>

I understand. I think I was just getting a little wild :s.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@Neatness</span> We could give an official layout… but I doubt anybody would use it. If a server wants to attract more players, then they’ll make their topic neat.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@postcount</span> I don’t particularly mind this idea, however I will say that it’s a members responsibility to run checks on whatever they intend on running. If they don’t trust it, don’t shouldn’t run it to begin with.</p>
