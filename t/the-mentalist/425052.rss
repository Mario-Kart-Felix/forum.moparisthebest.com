    <title>The Mentalist</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-mentalist/425052</link>
    <description>The Mentalist is a TV show based upon a character called Patrick Jane.

Patrick Jane is a CBI agent who solves crimes by being a &quot;Mentalist&quot;, which is someone that uses mental acuity, hypnosis or suggestion. This appears to be physic however he just uses normal every day situations to manipulate people into telling the truth or helping find the truth. He gained this experience from previously being a TV Psychic. 

His wife and child were brutally murdered after on his TV show announced that he was psychically homing in on a serial killer called Red John, this angered the serial killer leading to the death of Patricks family.

Its a quite enjoyable show with several layers, it is definitely worth a watch. It can get quite repetitive so I wouldn&#39;t suggest watching more than 2-3 episodes in a row.

<p>I agree with the vast majority of what you are saying, I don’t believe there is some “hypnotized state” whereby you can control people but I do believe its possible to achieve the heightened sense of suggestibility that allows people to be manipulated, and this can be amplified by things like television cameras, a big audience and a show. (or power/persuasion as you said).</p>
<p>I still don’t reckon Derren Brown does any fake hypnotism though (ie using actors or stooges) I think he is just relying on his skills and manipulation.</p>

              <p>I don’t know one bit about hypnotism. But I just find it impossible for anyone to become hypnotized legit. As you stated people only act hypnotized to play along, that’s why it is usually preformed on the opposite sex. Because a female would be less likely to be a douche about it than a male. In my point of view there are only a few types of hypnotism. Power over others (e.g. Hitler), Persuasion (e.g. Martin Luther King Jr) and Misdirection (e.e. Houdini). Feel free to argue because I know if I fucked up anything I typed just now I’ll be fucked in the ass like any other moparscape user.</p>

              <p>I don’t think you understand hypnotism, it isn’t some mind controlling state that makes people 100% under your control to do things. It’s hit and miss, but has been found to be extremely effective when television cameras are present as people feel urged to comply and go along with the show. It’s also used therapeutically in 1-1 sessions, it may not work with you or me, but if people want something to work it generally does as it just allows them to focus their concentration. There’s no mind controlling state, that’s just the showmanship dressing it up.</p>

Magic and misdirection are based on lies, doesn't mean its bullshit and it certainly doesn't mean hypnotism doesn't exist. Unless you have some compelling evidence to the contrary.
