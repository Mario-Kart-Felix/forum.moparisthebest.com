    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runserver-window-opens-and-closes-on-its-own-on-my-vps/252362</link>
    <description>I recently purchased a VPS, and whenever i run the runserver, it just closes really quickly. I try to resolve the problem by dling JDK 6 Update 11 but that didn&#39;t work. so, if anyone knows how to fix this problem please help :)</description>
