    <title>Buying and Selling X Amount</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/buying-and-selling-x-amount/543979</link>
    <description>Hey guys - I am opening this poll to see if I should add the Buy X and Sell X option to my server. I think this option would be extremely handy in some cases and save loads of time and clicks, but it will make the items that are available to buy with the X option less valuable. My server is very economically based and I am not sure if this will hurt the economy, or just be a benefit to my players and make the server more desirable. What do you guys think about this?</description>

<p>Only give the basics in shops. Don’t offer the best gear, the best skilling equipment, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t give large amounts of items; this makes it so players have to interact and trade and such to get more items and such (creating a better economy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On any “valueble” item in the shop put a cap on it on how many can be bought. Like RuneScape does with the GE. You can only buy X amount of an item every 4 hours, which varies per item.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But yes, add a buy X option. Buying 2000 runes at 10 at a time (or even 50) is annoying.</p>

I see what you’re saying. You should do the buy and sell X but have a max amount of items you can buy using it.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Player clicks buy X and types in 200000</p>
<p>Server sends message saying that the max items you may buy is 5000 (or something like that)<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Would the player only be allowed to buy 5000 items total, or could the player go back and re-type 5000 to get more items?[/quote]</p>
<p>5000 at a time, you can adjust this to whatever you want. Making the number lower makes it tedious to get large amounts therefore people will not want to waste time doing it and there will be less of the item in the world.</p>
