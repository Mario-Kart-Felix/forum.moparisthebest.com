    <title>Best source to start with</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-source-to-start-with/544297</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;m new in the Runescape private server development. I&#39;m currently studying Game Development and I&#39;m familiar with the programming languages Java, ActionScript, C#, LUA and have basic knowledge of C++.

What I&#39;m mainly trying to create is a RS server with:
- Exp rates that are the same as (or close to) the original RS;
- All classic skills available for all the members; (2007 version)
- Grand Exchange;

I would like to know which source would be best to start with, including the reason for it. I hope anybody knows a buggless source to start with.
I&#39;ve seen the list of 317 servers, but I&#39;m not sure which ones are the best in my case.

Looking forward to your replies.


Regards,

U say it’s based on RuneSource… but I have no idea of what that is/was. Was it a older version before it was called RuneScape?<br>

Ahh thanks for the link now I could read the topic and as far as I can see this is a good basic source that was extended into Asteria 2.0 by some other developer.</p>
<p>I also looked into Asteria 2.0 source files and it’s documented very well. This way it’s very easy to follow which functions are meant for what etc.<br>
As far as I could see, Asteria 2.0 didn’t had any bugs left if I’m correct? So I think it’s the best source I could start with.</p>
<p>Unless anybody else suggests a better bugless source, I’ll use Asteria.</p>
<p>Thanks for the information guys, really helped!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

              <p>I don’t mind the time and effort I have to put into it. As long as I can expand from a stable source. Th source PI ur referring to is bad for players u say, but which part of it is bad then? And why would you recommend it then?</p>
<p>About Asteria 2.0. Sounds promosing. Are there any known bugs in it? U say it’s based on RuneSource… but I have no idea of what that is/was. Was it a older version before it was called RuneScape?</p>

              <p>If you want a G.E. go with a higher revision than 317. You will never find a source that doesn’t have any bugs. If you want something with the lease amount of time go with PI(bad to have if you expect players). If you want something that’s even better than will strain your java skills go with Asteria 2.0(Very stable base, based off of runesource). The person that made that knows what he is doing. Forgive me if I’m wrong on anything community. Correct my mistakes.</p>
