Flawless? Hardly.<br>
It seriously looks like you took an obsidian knife and stretched it into these hideously shaped weapons. They are rushed, messy, and uneven. Take more time to work on them, because we prefer quality, not quantity.</p>
<p>Now remake these or make something that at least has SOME effort put into them.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Dude its better to start a rushed model and finish it later than make a model that people wont like even if it took really long to make it…<br>
keep up the work! Darque star[/quote]<br>

Flawless? Hardly.<br>
It seriously looks like you took an obsidian knife and stretched it into these hideously shaped weapons. They are rushed, messy, and uneven. Take more time to work on them, because we prefer quality, not quantity.</p>

Dude its better to start a rushed model and finish it later than make a model that people wont like even if it took really long to make it…<br>

<p>I would rather kill myself than look at someones model who has been rushed. That is why I’m not even commenting on these, they are very rushed, and all of the blades are the same, just used differently. I have not even commented in this section in a long time because of the fact, people are rushing models to get quantity, and not realizing, if you were to make this into a career, sure, it must be done fast, but they must be good.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just so everybody knows, the ‘I would rather kill myself’ is just a figure of speech.</p>

keep up the work! Darque star[/quote]There is a fine line between liking something and something actually being good. People could hate your model but gain respect for making such a good one. So since you have no idea what you are talking about, shut up.</p>
