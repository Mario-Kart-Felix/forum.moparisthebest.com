    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-port-forwording/92881</link>
    <description>mmk.. i went to the port forwording tut in tut section.
so i went to portforward.com and clicked on my router information that matched.
which was:
Ambit Router
ABOrion3000 as the one and only version thing i guess

then i went to the next page, but i dont know what to choose.
like what exactly, is moparscapes section?
so yeh.. if somone could tell me which of the thousand sections, files moparscape, that would be great,
