        <p>This is a very interesting and unique server. I enjoyed what little time I spent on it, but was unable to continue as my computer is rather sensitive and this server is too intensive on it to play it for any extensive amount of time. I wish the owner(s), the server and community the best of luck.</p>

<p>My opinion:</p>
<p>Then what is your motivation to keep this online and to keep up to date with the vps? Sure I can understand " I just want players to enjoy my game and that satisfies me. " But that will only drive you so far until later in life you will figure that your time is actually worth money. And that hosting/developing a game that will never accept 1 donation is unrealistic which will lead to you shutting this down which will also waist the players time and work in your game. In these forums people always blow out of proportion “HE SHOWED A LITTLE SHOP ABOUT DONATIONS! THE NERVE! HE IS JUST MONEY HUNGRY AND WANTS A QUICK BUCK!” That is not true what so ever. I agree there is a fine line between a decent amount of advertisement for your donation system and way to much advertisement where it becomes extremely annoying.  But there is nothing wrong what so ever about having a donation system because</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>you deserve a donation here and there <span class="bbcode-b">if</span> you produced a fun game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it gives players an assurance that a buck here and there will help the duration of how long your game stays online. Because if you make at least some money you are going to keep it online to see how much more you can get and it become time/cost effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you might have a job and might be completely fine on funds but paying for advertisements over and over and upgrading your vps and web hosts and e.t.c does add up and purchasing all of that just to get more players who you will never get 1$ from, because you will not take even one donation just will not turn out good. You are eventually going to get sick of purchasing all of this stuff and hosting it just so people can chill on your game for no return what so ever.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Just look at other top games. Find a way that you can balance the donation system so players have a desire to donate for it but at the same time where it is not a necessity for players who just cannot donate. (cosmetics is usually a really good way to go)</p>
<p>Maybe since this is your own game try adding expansions (in a sense) where you can unlock new lands and fight other types of monsters and do other quests and other fun activities for players to do that will not ruin your balance. It’s your own game you can think of some sweet stuff just use your imagination!</p>
<p>Your game looks fun continue the hard work and keep it up! I am excited to see your further development hosting your own game and see how everything turns out!</p>

<p>You know, you are amazing. Thank you so much for your comment (and I’m sorry for how little thought I had put into my last comment… that was… I don’t even know why I wrote that <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> it is true though).</p>
<p>I understand the concern. The thing is, I just… eh… I don’t feel something THIS simple deserves money; Yes it costs money to keep it up. The thing is… I’m a creator… I create things; I don’t want anything back… Often hobbies cost money; this is my hobby… and other than the hosting costs; the hobby is very cheap; it keeps me happy, expressed… and clear-minded.</p>
<p>It was in fact being hosted from my PC up until earlier today; I quietly switched over to a VPS and nobody noticed.<br>
This will come out cheaper than hosting it at home (because lol my PC is a monster, eats the universe in electric)… It will also make the server more stable and bring its uptime back to 100% (the pc died one morning while I was at work x,x was unable to fix until got home, dropped me to 99% uptime).</p>
<p>Anyways… I keep losing track of the topic:<br>
As stated above, its my hobby… people have expensive hobbies like stamp collecting or horse riding or mountain climbing… all of those cost way more money than my simple method of expression… I accept the little bit that this costs me.<br>
I know myself, I trust myself… The server will remain online.</p>
<p>–<br>
Last thought on the donation topic:<br>
I just… I don’t want to. I don’t want to become the very thing I despise right now… I don’t want entitled people. I want people to be the same as everyone else; all equal; playing, working together and discussing how best to beat this brutal game that’s got them trapped in Varrock.</p>
<p>That is why I removed PK from the server<br>
That is why I never added donations<br>
That is why I didn’t give everyone full bandos, 99s and 999m gp on login…</p>
<p>To keep everyone level-headed and friendly… And if you play here, that is what you will encounter… you will understand… discover… discuss and explore.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for your amazing comment, I wish you an amazing day. You deserve one.</p>
<p>-Fuzzout</p>
<p>Late edit:<br>
In one word: It’s passion that drives me. I just … I just want to create a world and watch people enjoy it, see what they do within and with it. I like being creative and my reward is seeing how others view it.</p>

        <p>Never experienced such a <span class="bbcode-b">unique</span> server before. It’s not unique because it would have some custom items… no. It’s unique because <span class="bbcode-b">the whole concept is different</span> than any other server. There is a bit of backstory, but mostly there are classes, abilities of these classes, different world approach, more aggressive yet more rewarding. I love it. Try it out people!</p>
<p>I give this server <span class="bbcode-b">9/10.</span></p>
<p>PS: Cut all plants you see. (Yes, you can cut the plants that are there just for decoration in RS or other servers!)</p>

[ul][li]Firemaking re-written; Normal logs create a fire, Oak logs create a healing field, willow logs yield gold, maple logs yield damage boost, yew logs create a teleport field, magic logs yield runes.[/li]<br>
[li]Smithing re-done; smelting requires logs of a certain quality to maintain the heat within the forge[/li]<br>
[li]Bars can only craft the armor components (chest,helm, shield, legs)[/li]<br>
[li]Dragon armor can be crafted by using a black dragonhide on a workbench (extra items required)[/li]<br>

[li]Interactive world[/li]<br>
[li]Custom-created Runecrafting, now with 100% more action and murder.[/li]<br>
[li]Custom-created way to obtain GS blades, Dragon Full helms and Dragonfire shields - Players must summon the Lava Forge from within the Wilderness volcano[/li]<br>

[li]Many different types of foods, effects and ways to obtain them[/li]<br>
[li]Removed prayer and in its stead is ‘Divination’ which is leveled by burying bones; the higher this skill the shorter the subclass cooldowns are going to be.[/li]<br>

[li]Interlinked multiple items, skills, subclasses so that they are continuously useful though-out the progression.[/li]<br>
[li]Implemented EDS - Epic Defense System - where your Defense Level, Buffs, Food, Subclass skills and Armor all together work to reduce damage. (if with 0 defense an attack hits you for 100; at 350 defense same attack hits you for 45)[/li]<br>
[li]Agility increases attack speed (by 0.5 at 99; 0.5 is half a second less between attacks)[/li]<br>
[li]Armor cannot be traded, thus making the server semi-ironman[/li]<br>
[li]Various classes have abilities that affect everyone on the server[/li]<br>
