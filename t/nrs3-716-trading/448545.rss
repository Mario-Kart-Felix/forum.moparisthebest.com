    <title>Nrs3 716 (Trading)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nrs3-716-trading/448545</link>
    <description>Many of you know who downloaded TimeNrs3 667 loading 716 server you realized the Trading was glitched.. if you have fixed it or know what the problem is, think you can find it? here is my Trade.Java file.. Basically what happens is when 2 players trade. one player will get glitched out of trade while the other is still in it.. only way for trade to work is by clicking the Trade in the Chat box..  IDK if this makes sense to you guys but if  it does download my Trade.java and let me know what the problem is or where it is! thanks!
