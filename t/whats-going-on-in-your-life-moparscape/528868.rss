    <title>What&#39;s going on in your life MoparScape?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-going-on-in-your-life-moparscape/528868</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t posted a topic in here for a while and I haven&#39;t seen a post-worthy topic in a while (jmo).

Anyways, what&#39;s happening in everyone&#39;s lives? You call talk about school, making new friends, hobbies or really anything you think is relevant to post.


I&#39;ll start off. I&#39;m starting college tomorrow (August 26th) at Tennessee Tech University and I plan to major in Computer Engineering. I&#39;m looking for a job where I live to pay for school and I hope I can find a good balance of school/job/girlfriend/hobbies if you have any suggestions on time management feel free to post. I haven&#39;t been hopelessly browsing the internet like I used to, I&#39;ve found better activities to do than to always sit at my computer. I haven&#39;t played any video games in months aside from a bit of UMvC3 and some classic Cod4.

Anyways, post away!</description>

<p>Good way of looking at it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Keep your head up!</p>
<p>I started working for Sprint Customer Care and it is the most mental fking job I’ve ever had… Customers call in all day and tell you how big of a POS you and and you agree with them…lol<br>
Getting married June 14th so I’m having too work some overtime in order to make sure we can pay for it plus the honeymoon. I told her McDonald’s would be a perfect honey moon but she said she would divorce me?<br>
In about 2-3 months we will be looking for a house with a bank loan so I’m pretty excited about that. I’ve been living in an apt for about 2 years and were growing out of it.<br>
Recently got the Xbox back so I’ve been playig some FC3, DP3 and a little of assasins creed 3… Other than that life is decent and living one day at a time.</p>

              <p>My crush broke up with me after a week… In the first part of this summer I was mainly depressed because of that, usually drinking my sorry ass up because of that.<br>
I learned a little more Java, C and Assembly this summer when I wasn’t depressed. I blocked the girl from fb because she said she still loved me but apparently didn’t hesitate to kiss a guy when she was on vacation in Turkey. Bought a book to get my driver’s license but haven’t really looked into it. I applied everywhere to get a job and I finally got one; I only have to work saturdays for 8 hours and I get paid €330/month. Today I’ve been having stings on the area of my lungs again, which means they probably partially collapsed (I smoked some weed with friends… shouldn’t have done that)… If I don’t show up next weekend I may lose my job and school starts again next monday so I’ll have to face that girl again (unless I’ll be in the hospital for my lungs… great)</p>
<p>So yeah… fun stuff</p>

Failed a few driving tests.  Didn’t get a few jobs I interviewed for.  Senior year of high school starts next week, but it looks like I just have easy classes. (Computer Science &amp; programming, BUsiness Management, World Literature, Building Wealth, Algebra 2 B, Spanish 1, and Ceramics.)  I’ll probably switch out Spanish for Honors Physics if they’ll let me because I already took that spanish class in eighth grade.<br>

Well if you want more, I work at a correctional facility now. My computer is broke and my bills are nearly caught back up. I could make a mile long list man, the only important price to me is I lost my gf who I was getting ready to pop the question to.<br>

<p>i called to follow up a week later for more than half, some called back saying the position has already been filled. i walked in two a few stores in person to see if the manager even considered my application and i kind of just stopped looking. i’m looking now at fast food places, i haven’t tried any. maybe even the local food lion down the street. i just need to get motivated again. my parents agreed to pay for insurance for one year until i can find a job, but i hate making them pay an extra $90 a month.</p>

<p>i didn’t even have to take a driving test for my license, i just walked in and it was even free. got a temporary license but have to go to court and pick up the hard copy pretty soon.</p>
