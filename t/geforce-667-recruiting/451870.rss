    <title>GeForce 667 Recruiting!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/geforce-667-recruiting/451870</link>
    <description>Hello, I am Katastrphy Owner of GeForce Project. I am recruiting a team for my rsps. Currently looking for someone with experience with java, mysql and coding in 667+. Currently using rscali v2 as base. i have a vps.

I am Also looking for someone that can do client sided also.

The map data is very messed up in some areas. I&#39;m also hoping to learn a bit of java from this myself. I don&#39;t like older revisions and love full screen which is why i&#39;m not starting with 317. Plus there isn&#39;t allot of good 667+ out there.

If you&#39;re interested please contact me via skype: dmxrb89</description>
