    <title>The use of WMDs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-use-of-wmds/459204</link>
    <description>When is it okay to use a weapon of mass destruction?
Should every country be given a weapon of mass destruction?
Should every WMD be destroyed?

Just discuss it here.</description>

<p>I only said the Japanese disaster since it was more recent and people may not have known about the Chernobyl catastrophe. Chernobyl was also handled badly, very badly by the powers that controlled it. If they were more careful with the boron rods it wouldn’t have seen the surge in power and done what it done. All it took was a momentary slip of the mind and disaster was imminent.</p>

<p>Yes, but the radioactive particles are taken in through water patterns, blown through wind and transported with food all over the world.</p>

</aside>
<p>so friggin what, 416,000 American soldiers gave their lives in WW2 and you’re acting like 10,000 people committing suicide for not wanting to be prisoners of war being surprising?</p>
<p>both of you seem surprised Japan would be willing to fight until the end as a country as if it’s some strange foreign concept but it bloody well isn’t, here’s a famous quote from Winston Churchill,</p>
<blockquote>Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.</blockquote>
<p>and I’m pretty fucking confident that if an invasion of the US ever occurred that very few citizens would actually surrender outright, especially to Japan</p>

Obviously no I think it could have been avoided. But the bombs had SO many reasons they were used, still not able to justify it but it had alot of reasons, one of the main ones was to dissuade Russia from ever going against us. And I do think warning them that they will see mass destruction and to surrender was a good idea, the dumb part was dropping the second. Waiting just a few more days they would realize what the first bomb actually did.</p>
<p>And you can’t compare a WORLD WAR to a small middle eastern conflict, everyone was bombing shit. France, London, Stalingrad.  No one will ever one up Hitler.</p>
<p>Though at the time im sure everyone just wanted to see the war over, unknown it would be constantly whined about 70 years later.</p>

Only Americans are stupid enough to use WMDs, that is why DPRK hasn’t used any yet.[/quote]<br>
WWII the germans would have used them before us if we didn’t stop them. Meanwhile we chose to bomb the factories building planes and ships in Hiroshima and Nagasaki so the Japanese couldn’t keep fighting after being warned.</p>
