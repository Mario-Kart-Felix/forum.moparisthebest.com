    <title>[Help] PHP/MySQL to flash</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-php-mysql-to-flash/517988</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not the best with php and MySQL.
What I&#39;m trying to do here is have users register on a site. After registering, they would proceed to play my flash game and login. The point of registering is to connect to a MySQL database while playing the flash game, and it saves your player data as you go on. I&#39;ve got it connected correctly, but I don&#39;t know how to make a login/register system :(

This is how something is inserted to the database:
INSERT INTO data (name, password, distance) VALUES ($username, $password, 0)
[The ID is auto-incremented, so it&#39;s not added into this]

When the person logs in via php, it needs to POST the username, and that it was a valid login.
This makes it possible for Flash to pick up the variable.</description>

Would be an example of secure code to use, [b]never[/b] trust user input. Not meaning to sound like a dick towards Bellend (pardon the pun :P) but I wouldn't want your site being vulnerable.

he asked for a way on how to do this, not how to make it secure. If i were to spend time securing the code i would be here for hours. Plus i'm not here to do the work for him.

a way for you to make sure people can't inject you is to just escape the string with this function "mysql_real_escape_string($STRING)"
that way the user input will not affect the process.[/quote]

Securing code isn't hard when you know what you're doing and decide to stop being lazy. The time it takes to secure a simple form is as long as it takes to write out the necessary function(s) in the code.

I agree with Ruby; don't post vulnerable code.

No, I know. I just wouldn't want someone taking vulnerable code and being injected for it. Also, no. You shouldn't be using any mysql_ functions at all. Take a look at [url=http://www.jamiehurst.co.uk/tutorial-introduction-mysqli-prepared-queries/]prepared statements[/url] which are a much more safer way of ensuring safety in your scripts. Like I said, nothing to be taken away from you it's just that your code was bad and vulnerable.

              <p>Ok, so insted of updating the Database directly from flash (and having to use a DLL service) you are best of just using php requests</p>
<p>so make a new webrequest in flash to a file like so: “<a href="http://www.sitename.com/requests/SavePlayer.php?name=" rel="nofollow noopener">www.sitename.com/requests/SavePlayer.php?name=</a>” + PlayerName<br>
PlayerName is a variable that your flash game will hold</p>
<p>then the php file will look something like this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;?php
if(isset($_GET['name'])) {
    $UName = $_GET['name'];
}else{
    $UName = "";
}

$Query = "INSERT INTO tablename (Username, Column2) VALUES ('$UName', 'Something')"; //this will set the query into a variable string
mysql_query($Query); //this will call the string as a query and run it into your database
echo mysql_error(); //this will print any errors if you have any...
