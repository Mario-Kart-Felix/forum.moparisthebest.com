So, you’re saying that there two id’s for one door, each either closed or opened?<br>
[/quote]Correct. One for the open state, one for the closed.</p>
<p>[quote author=xXSh0ckXx link=topic=672597.msg4498053#msg4498053 date=1446213404]<br>
For instance, we’re having the door id 50, which means it’s already open<br>
so closed would be 49? Meh.<br>
[/quote]I’m not sure, it depends on the object. But typically the one with the “Open” option will be the lower number.</p>

<p>Oh well, haha, I managed to use the same tile and same object but a different rotation. Pretty much independent of id’s (except the door id’s itself) and perfect for a system supporting all doors.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s possible to use a single object, yes. Doing it that way will typically leave your opened door facing backwards, or your closed one (Depending which id you used).<br>
But if you want it done to match runescape (aka “properly”), you have to use the second id as well (Because when open it gives a “close” option).<br>

Ah. You’re right, I forgot the options part.</p>

<p>Look into the class where object interaction is being handled, and then either replace the existing object with a new one which has a different rotation, or just modify the object so that it would change its rotation. That’d be one way.<br>

Believe it or not, runescape doesn’t keep the open door on the same tile as the closed door, or vice versa. I figured this out when I was working on doors for my POH.</p>
<p>The proper way to make doors work is like so:<br>
Get the door’s object id, and position (x, y, z).<br>
If the door is already open, the id it requires <span class="bbcode-i">should be</span> is 1 less than the door’s ID. If the door is closed, it should need the ID that’s 1 above the door’s ID. However, in some special cases this isn’t true.<br>
Once a player clicks a door, you move it 1 tile off (This depends on what way the door opens/closes), and then replace it with the new ID from above.[/quote]</p>
