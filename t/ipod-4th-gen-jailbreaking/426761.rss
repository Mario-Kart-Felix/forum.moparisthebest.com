    <title>iPod 4th Gen Jailbreaking</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ipod-4th-gen-jailbreaking/426761</link>
    <description>Is it possible to jailbreak 5.0.1 ipod.  I just got this one, and originally didn&#39;t plan on jailbreaking it, but after realizing how many of my apps on my other ipod were from Cydia, I want to.  

Thanks to anyone who helps.
