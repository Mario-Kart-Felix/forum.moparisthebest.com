[center][size=32pt][b]A little introduction[/b][/size][/center]
[hr]

[center][b]I have made numerous projects in the past and most have either failed because of my inability to continue a project because of my life in the past. Just stating this now because i know a fair few people on here. My last private server was around a year and a half ago (which also failed because of personal problems) and since then my life has changed drastically. I now have a full time job and a stable life. But what i dont have is 24/7 to code and build websites etc. So i would like to offer a chance to start a project and continue gradually over a time where we can put real detail and features into the server. I will be able to fund this server and pay for advertisements etc. (Can provide proof of this). I will also be able to code in my spare time if needed.[/b]

              <p>Bump for this. I’ve worked on a couple of projects with Munien back in the day. He is an extremely dedicated and capable developer with a strive for expanding his own knowledge, if he can’t do something, he’s sure going to figure out how. Excited to be back on a team with him.</p>
