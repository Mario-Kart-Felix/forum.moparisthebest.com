    <title>Joining a Team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/joining-a-team/399958</link>
    <description>[font=comic sans ms][size=10pt]Hi, im joining a development team, and this is what i can do, im a forums developer and i work with website making. I have experienced with website making just for 1 year, but i can make really nice forums and sites really good. Can show my work, but not putting links. I am not willing to join a noob team, i want to join a team that takes things seriously. Making forums and site takes me less then an hour to make, to make it perfect and add forum ranks and other things will take a full hour.

My name is Steven and im 14 year olds.

I have been making forums for many private servers long time ago and i used t own my own Rsps with 20+ players last year. As im also a rsps coder PI coder, i can code quest tab spawning pretty easy. And change many things into a source. But overall the best thing i can code is a 525 codeusa. I know many people as i am trusted.</description>
