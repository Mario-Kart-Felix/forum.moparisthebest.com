    <title>Help removing npc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-removing-npc/478168</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using the RSCA source. There is a &quot;shifty looking man&quot; behind the Edgeville bank and I wish to remove him. I searched NPCloc thoroughly several times and I am confident he is not there. Where else could the files on him be?

Also, does anyone have an object id list? Like trees, portals, benches, etc? I have this one, http://jamili.da3rx.com/rsc/objects.html, but it would be nice if there was one with pictures! If there isn&#39;t one then I might make one for the community.

EDIT: It was the event token npc and his id says 24 but is actually 802 in the NPCLoc file.

              <p>[quote=“vortex, post:2, topic:478168”]I don’t think anyone has made an objects list with any pictures, not that I know of anyway. But what would be really cool is if you dumped the actual models with their correct sprites/colours and had some JavaScript script to make them viewable in a browser.<br>
To get you started, here’s a wiki page on the OB3 format written by .S. (I can’t remember his forum name): <a href="http://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/index.php?title=OB3%5B/quote%5DYeah" rel="nofollow noopener">http://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/index.php?title=OB3[/quote]Yeah</a> I got dumps from imthenull and used a viewer in Javascript. Worked out pretty well :P.</p>

              <p>You could always make a command that just starts placing the objects in 1 spot and keeps changing it. Then, have a command that stops it and tells you the id of the current object.</p>
<p>If you still want to make a list, you could use the above along with a client that takes screenshots of the object when it changes (you should be able to write a script for an existing bot that does this).</p>
