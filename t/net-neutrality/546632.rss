    <title>Net Neutrality</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/net-neutrality/546632</link>
    <description>I just called my Senator and told him to support Net Neutrality. His representative said that he already signed the Net Neutrality letter and he IS a supporter of Net Neutrality.

What did you do, Moparians, to support Net Neutrality today?  :confused:</description>

<p>Internet fast lanes? How is that a good idea? Internet service might be thought of like a utility like Electricity. What if you use your electricity for a gaming computer? What if you use it for powering a light-bulb? The power company doesn’t tell you that you can’t use your electricity for certain products. Now the internet is a little different, because they may have “Peered” relationships with certain other networks that give them a much faster service to certain other networks. Major carriers may peer with eachother for faster inter-network speeds of cached data, on both networks. The issue at hand is very straightforward. Should we allow internet “Fast Lanes” that allow content providers to pay to have their service work faster than other peoples internet services? If you say no to net neutrality, you are saying NO to innovation, freedom, and access.<br>
