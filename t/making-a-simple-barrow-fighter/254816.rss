    <title>Making a simple barrow fighter</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-simple-barrow-fighter/254816</link>
    <description>Well I need to make an affordable barrows fighter. [Barrows fighter - an account that can beat a barrows run]

I was thinking of these stats

1strength
1attack
25/30defence[For mystic robes/dosen&#39;t take anytime at all]
43/52(60-70 LATER ON)prayer[For protection ofcourse]
62mage[Airwave to kill the npc]

I am guessing it will take me about 800k for 62mage 500-600k for the prayer [Mystic staff method for mage]

So I&#39;m trying not to waist more than 1.5-1.8mil on this account and only about 2 weeks to make it.

And I only want to waist around 200k in items before the first good loot [Not including blasts[w/ blasts 500k]]

If anyone has any better ideas please post</description>

There is a trick that you can use to get any of the melee brothers stuck on one of the rocks in the barrows, but I don’t recommend it. It’s supposed to be very hard to do. On top of that, barrows just aren’t the same anymore. You have to be able to do trips really cheap to get your money’s worth out of it, so your plan doesn’t seem economically smart at all. But otherwise, yeah, you should be able to do it fine, though you are going to get torn apart in the catacombs.<br>

Well, im gunna raise my def at 50 now, and when i go into the catacombs ill just wear full rune. But, every time there is at least 50k + drop in ruins or $ or other items, 50k per trip is enough to keep me going, even though it’s more likely to be around 100k in runes, usually minds[300 avrg.] chaoses [150+ avrg.] and deaths [50+ avrg.][/quote]</p>
<p>I usually burn through around 50-80 slayer darts when I go there, but that’s with 77 magic. Slayer dart is the bomb tbh, but only if you can take the hits from the brothers.</p>

              <p>Well I need to make an affordable barrows fighter. [Barrows fighter - an account that can beat a barrows run]</p>
<p>I was thinking of these stats</p>
<p>1strength<br>
1attack<br>
25/30defence[For mystic robes/dosen’t take anytime at all]<br>
43/52(60-70 LATER ON)prayer[For protection ofcourse]<br>
62mage[Airwave to kill the npc]</p>
<p>I am guessing it will take me about 800k for 62mage 500-600k for the prayer [Mystic staff method for mage]</p>
<p>So I’m trying not to waist more than 1.5-1.8mil on this account and only about 2 weeks to make it.</p>
<p>And I only want to waist around 200k in items before the first good loot [Not including blasts[w/ blasts 500k]]</p>
<p>If anyone has any better ideas please post</p>
