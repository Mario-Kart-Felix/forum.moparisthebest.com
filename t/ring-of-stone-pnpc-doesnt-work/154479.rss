    <title>Ring of Stone + ::pnpc doesn&#39;t work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ring-of-stone-pnpc-doesnt-work/154479</link>
    <description>The title is self-explanitary but here is the problem;


When someone wields a ring of stone on my server, they turn into a stone for about 1 second and then  change back.

[code]	public boolean wear(int wearID, int slot) {
		int targetSlot = 0;
		if((playerItems[slot] - 1) == wearID) {
		if(wearID == 6583) {
		npcId = 2626;
		isNpc = true;
		updateRequired = true;
		appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
}[/code]


That is the script (I got that of another source I previously used and it works fine.)


[b][u]::pnpc[/b][/u]


The same happens with ::pnpc (number). I type in the NPC ID and it changes to the NPC for about 1 secons and then changes back.

[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;pnpc&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 3) {
				try {
					int newNPC = Integer.parseInt(command.substring(5));
					if (newNPC &lt;= 10000 &amp;&amp; newNPC &gt;= 0) {
						npcId = newNPC;
						isNpc = true;
						updateRequired = true;
						appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
					} else {
						sendMessage(&quot;No such P-NPC.&quot;);
					}
				} catch(Exception e) {
					sendMessage(&quot;Wrong Syntax! Use as ::pnpc #&quot;);
				}
				 }[/code]

That is the PNPC script. I also got that of a source I used to use on my server but it doesn&#39;t work on my new one.

Any help on [b]fixing this[/b] would be great, thanks.
