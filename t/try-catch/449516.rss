          <blockquote>
              <p>using throws declarations is typically the behavior used whilst making an API since you want the user to handle unexpected cases. using throws instead of try/catching also allows the program to handle exceptions at different levels of the task being executed. for example, you wouldn’t want to try/catch every helper function for a parser since the overall parsing scheme would continue to execute after a most likely fatal error has occurred.</p>
<p>edit: also, your original post is somewhat correct, avoiding try-catch and throws is a good idea when you don’t need to use them since they’re expensive operations. you could simply error check yourself and return false, -1, or null to indicate a bad result.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Taharok, post:5, topic:449516”]You can’t avoid them, unless you are using [tt]throws[/tt] modifiers instead, which is probably not good practice. You should use [tt]throws[/tt] when you want scopes that are invoking your method to be aware of possible exceptions that may occur during it, and allow them to handle it appropriately. [tt]try{}catch{}[/tt] is used to handle those situations. Some methods may not want to handle the exceptions of methods they call, so they may copy the called method’s [tt]throws[/tt] declarations as to notify any methods invoking THAT method that there are possible exceptions that may occur.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you don’t want to just use a try{}catch(Throwable t){} or try{}catch(Exception e){} or something along those lines. It’s good practice to have a catch for each possible exception outcome, so you can handle each expected area of possible failure. Some exceptions can occur when the program is not executing properly (these are called RuntimeExceptions). A RuntimeException should not be preempted. They should only occur when something is seriously wrong and will be unexpected.</p>
<p>As far as design strategy goes, you may run into situations where you can either set a state or throw an exception (ie, set a state to ‘error’ or throw an IllegalStateException). It’s really up to you which one you use, but I tend to follow the rule that if other programmers are going to be seeing my code, I will use more exceptions than states. Another thing to consider is whether you want to interrupt program flow. Not all invoking methods may properly handle an exception your method is going to through (especially in the case of a RuntimeException), so by choosing to throw an exception versus returning false, null, or some other error-indicating value, you may be significantly changing the flow of the application because the exception may interrupt the execution of the invoking method.</p>
<p>So there’s plenty to consider when using exceptions. :P[/quote]<br>
These are the answers i’m always looking for, thanks Taharok <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
