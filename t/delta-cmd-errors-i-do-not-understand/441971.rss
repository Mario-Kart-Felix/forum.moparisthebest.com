    <title>[DELTA] CMD Errors i do not understand</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-cmd-errors-i-do-not-understand/441971</link>
    <description>hey guys 

i need some help with my server.. i followed a guide on adding hp/pray orbs to the client and i did it on a delta client that i am currently working on.

the guide can be found here : http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/tutorials/304159-adding-hp-prayer-run-orbs.html

The guide works out fine except for some functions that have been already added. So i decreased the number of errors by deleting the duplicate functions but the errors in the following image make no sense to me :( could someone please tell me what they mean and how to solve them?
