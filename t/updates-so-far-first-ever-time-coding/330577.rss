    <title>Updates so far! (First ever time coding!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/updates-so-far-first-ever-time-coding/330577</link>
    <description>Hey,
I&#39;ve just started coding ... and yes I barely know what I&#39;m doing  ... so don&#39;t flame me for what I&#39;ve done so far ... for me it&#39;s pretty good  ;)

I started off with pr0digyscape source (v1, with heaps of monster drops etc.)

So far I have added in:

Random monsters drop christmas crackers - and I gave crackers 100% reward chance, no &quot;The person you pulled the cracker with got the reward&quot; crap (only going to be a drop as a server opening &quot;event&quot;.
Fixed glitched slayer tasks!
Changed mod shop completely (more to come)
Added stats to yin yang amulet and meat tenderiser (yin yang is now 2% drop from battle mages)
Made requirements for yin yang 99 strength and 99 mage.
Fixed npc drop rates (will be lowered heaps later on)
Made corporeal beast drops more balanced (ratio of spirit shields/elixers to sigils.)
Increased damage of most monsters, especially bando genereal
Updated client files (backround is now noraml!! no stupid hard to see crap!!)
Fixed santa armour so it goes in correct spots.
Changed cracker rewards to include custom santas, santa armour and gold partyhat!
Clue scrolls now have more balanced rewards (no 3a every 3rd clue)
completed commands -- ::owneryell, ::adminyell and ::modyell! (and fixed up the length of ::yell so text isn&#39;t cut off)
made awesome ::omegaglow command for owners and ::adminglow for admins
also added ::stars for regular players
custom jail fully complete in dungeon (so people can&#39;t glitch themselves out or anything like that!)

2ND BIGGEST UPDATE!!! FULLY WORKING ADMIN ZONE!!! AT LLEYTA!! (took one and a half hours!!)
It took so long because it was the first time I&#39;ve ever done multiple npc dialogues
on the same npc. But got it in the end!
Also had to customise some items to be benefitted.
Also added santa who gives sleds (gives admins running speed advantage.)


added in quest starting npcs at home area (eg. merlin, sailor and king arthur etc...)
I also removed ::quests command, hoping to make quest cape actually have requirements so people have to work for it!
added in skull sword and shield as drops from skeleton (low chance, would take regulars around 120mins + for one)
added in ::commands and ::information commands



THIS IS FROM INTERNET
added new runescape whip and dharok axe models


AND PROBABLY BIGGEST UPDATE SO FAR!! (TOOK 2 HOURS IN TOTAL -.-) (FIRST CUSTOM I&#39;VE EVER DONE!)

ADDED HAND CANNON!!! (but only models were from internet :S) Had to add all the correct emotes myself which took one hour.
The rest was taken up adding it into server, 
adding a monster to drop it (archer at rock crabs) (2% chance, cause stats are +300 to everything), and modifying it.

So yeah, try not to flame, I know it&#39;s not that impressive but I don&#39;t really care. It&#39;s impressive to me  ;)</description>
