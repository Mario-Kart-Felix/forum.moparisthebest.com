    <description>Hey,
My Dad has just come back from Barcelona. He went to the Mobile Convention.
I picked up a leaflet saying...The I-Mate,Innovation By Design.By windows mobile!?  
So, There is a new i-Mate?Has anyone seen it?
Also About the I-Phone By Apple? That won&#39;t be sold Until June 2007[Thanks Parad0x..]Because it wasn&#39;t 3G.
Why are all these Computer Makes, Making Phones? Its Just Weird!
Btw, Don&#39;t try [url=http://www.i-mate.com][u]This[/u][/url] because its a Meeting Up Site..With Lesbians And Shit..
I&#39;ll Post some more when i now more.
Also, What phones do you have?
