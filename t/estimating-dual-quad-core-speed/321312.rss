    <title>Estimating dual/quad core speed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/estimating-dual-quad-core-speed/321312</link>
    <description>Okay I don&#39;t want an exact method of calculating this because there probably isn&#39;t one, what with multithreaded applications that make use of multiple cores etc, I just want to know how to work out the overall apparent speed of a processor within the nearest 2GHz.

I&#39;ve searched around for a while and asked people, but everyone says different. Some people say the total speed is the same as the speed of a single core, but overall is a little bit faster. Others say you multiply the speed of a single core by the number of cores, and a few people have said you multiply the speed by the power of how many cores there are - eg, 1.73^4 for a quad core processor at 1.73Ghz.</description>

              <p>^. never expect to get core*ghz of computing power cause there would be less than 99.9% of applications written that have dynamic threading and/or can scale as well as you’d think, dual core is great and is the standard for gaming, video/audio decoding/encoding &amp; server usage is great for anything more than 2, but not required.</p>

              <p>The number of instructions per second is what you should be interested in.  I know back in the day, Intel Pentium 4’s @ 2Ghz and AMD Athlon XP 2000+ @ 1.2Ghz, even though the clock speed was lower on the AMD it performed more instructions per cycle and therefore ended up being the faster processor.  Ghz isn’t everything.</p>
<p>In the case of multi-core CPUs, you can’t “estimate multi-core speed”, because it doesn’t work like that.  It all depends how the program is written, if it is written in a very linear way, even if you have 80 cores it will only run on 1 core, and be the same speed as if you just had a 1 core CPU.  Some programs can take advantage of many cores though, apache comes to mind since it spawns a new ‘instance’ with every client, theoretically if you had 80 cores and 80 clients they could each run on a separate core and be 80x faster than an equivalent 1 core CPU.  Of course in practice this isn’t the case because the CPU isn’t the bottleneck there, rather the network, RAM, or hard disk would be.</p>
<p>Bottom line is unless you are running a server, or very CPU intensive programs like graphics rendering (not games) then a dual-core CPU will be more than sufficient, if you get a quad-core you probably won’t use half of it at all most of the time.  And an 8-core would be a huge waste.</p>

This is the biggest myth in the world. Its all bullshit because processing power is not defined by clock speed or cores on its own, the architecture is much more important.</p>
<p>Basically there is the biggest gap between 1 core and dual core and the gap of performance decreases as more cores are crammed into one die.</p>

well the performances there are almost what  you’d expect, the single core is only about a minute shy of double the dual cores time, the dual core is almost double the quad core times</p>

              <p>i believe you would multiply the cores by the clock speed and this would give you an effective speed which is how they are soemtimes referred to as, so a quad core at 2Ghz has an effective speed of 8Ghz meaning it wouldnt neessarily perform the same as a single core at that clock speed</p>
