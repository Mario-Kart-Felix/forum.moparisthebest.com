<p>How many people do you think want to do that, I didn’t even let alone want to read it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I can’t let Mr. Ox Random Xi’s misinformation and misguided arguments about egotism go by without comment. Let me get to the crux of the matter: For Ox Random Xi’s hotheaded plans to succeed, he needs to dumb down our society. An uninformed populace is easier to control and manipulate than an educated populace. Quicker than you can double-check the spelling of “thymolsulphonephthalein”, schoolchildren will stop being required to learn the meanings of words like “syncategorematically” and “succinylsulphathiazole”. They will be incapable of comprehending that Ox Random Xi’s associates are unified under a common goal. That goal is to incite racial hatred. At the same time, if we were to let Ox Random Xi get away with offering stones instead of bread to the emotional and spiritual hungers of the world, that would be a gross miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p>Ox Random Xi always demands instant gratification. That’s all that is of concern to him; nothing else matters—except maybe to expand, augment, and intensify the size and intrusiveness of his polity. I tell you this because Ox Random Xi says that he is beyond reproach. But then he turns around and says that there’s no difference between normal people like you and me and unimaginative, foul-mouthed sectarians. You know, you can’t have it both ways, Ox Random Xi. It is common knowledge that if we fail to tend to the casualties of his war on sanity then all of our sacrifices will be as forgotten as the sand blowing across Ozymandias’s dead empire. The “decay of that colossal wreck,” as the poet Shelley puts it, teaches us that there is no excuse for the innumerable errors of fact, the slovenly and philistine artistic judgments, the historical ineptitude, the internal contradictions, and the various half-truths, untruths, and gussied-up truths that litter every one of Ox Random Xi’s essays from the first word to the last. Despite the fact that a plan of rational reaction to Ox Random Xi’s nostrums is in order, you can hear the crwth’s fremescent clangor every time Ox Random Xi tries to palliate and excuse the atrocities of his compeers. (Actually, his apostles remain a small isolated minority except during times of economic or social stress, when a mass following develops to blame rummy defalcators for the problems besetting society, but that’s not important now.)</p>
<p>You may have noticed that thanks to Ox Random Xi’s crapulous refrains, all the people around here, of whatever condition in life, are dejected and sorrowful to an extent that I have never before witnessed. But you don’t know the half of it. For starters, my number one priority is to substitute movement for stagnation, purposive behavior for drifting, and visions of a great future for collective pettiness and discouragement. Think about it, and I’m sure you’ll agree with me. None but the rancorous can deny that in a tacit concession of defeat, Ox Random Xi is now openly calling for the abridgment of various freedoms to accomplish coercively what his dishonest hypnopompic insights have failed at. In my observations upon antipluralism, I have expressed no opinion thus far of the mode of its extinguishment or melioration. I will note, however, though I still have nothing to propose, that if Ox Random Xi’s thinking were cerebral rather than glandular, he wouldn’t consider it such a good idea to allow federally funded research to mushroom into a sneaky, grossly inefficient system, hampered by scummy poseurs and dodgy riffraff. It’s really not bloody-mindedness that compels me to punish those who lie or connive at half-truths. It’s my sense of responsibility to you, the reader. Anyway, I hope I’ve made my point, which is that on theoretical grounds alone, Mr. Ox Random Xi’s statements are so filled with errors that I feel some futility in replying to them.[/quote]<br>
I’m sorry, I didn’t know I was going to be so poetically insulted in such a manner of elegance. On another note, I feel you ripped that and did a copy and replace with “Ox Random Xi”. Secondly, Ox Random Xi isn’t my name, it’s ox random xi. Please stop capitalizing words that shouldn’t be.<br>
Also, I was just pointing out that someone in this word created “Tl; dr” because people are lazy, and I never said we’re the same as each other.<br>
Now stop ripping shit from somewhere else and putting my name in, because half of that shit was completely fabricated and pulled out of your ass.<br>
If you come back here, and try to pull some shit like that again, I’m not even going to waste my time replying to something so idiotic and stupid.<br>
Good day.</p>

<p>[s]<br>
[size=1pt]Multifarious avenues of approach vie for attention as potential retorts to Mr. Krackkid LOL Krackky III’s unprincipled doctrines. With this letter, I hope to point the high-powered fire hose of truth at Krackkid’s libidinous canards to wash away their multiple layers of poststructuralism. But first, I would like to make the following introductory remark: If Krackkid had his way, schools would teach students that the moon is made of green cheese. This is not education but indoctrination. It prevents students from learning about how I know some uncongenial slubberdegullions who actually believe that we should avoid personal responsibility. Incredible? Those same people have told me that black is white and night is day. With such people roaming about, it should come as no surprise to you that Krackkid’s protégés are more determined than most wild, sinister varmints. Do I blame society for this? No, I blame Krackkid.</p>
<p>Krackkid makes it sound like five-crystal orgone generators can eliminate mind-control energies that are being radiated from secret, underground, government facilities. That’s the rankest sort of pretense I’ve ever heard. The reality is that I could write a hundred letters about how hostility is a primary component of Krackkid’s behavior. I can tell innumerable stories about Krackkid’s desire to blame those who have no power to change the current direction of events. And I can show you that his perceptions resonate with the deviltry of escapism. Regardless of what I do, however, Krackkid accuses me of being a liar. The only proven liar around here, however, is Krackkid. Only a die-hard liar like Krackkid could claim that he never engages in hypersensitive, impulsive, or lackadaisical politics. The truth, in case you haven’t already figured it out, is that he speaks like a true defender of the status quo—a status quo, we should not forget, that enables him to agitate for indoctrination programs in local schools.</p>
<p>It’s never too late to initiate meaningful change. In that context, one could say that if Krackkid is victorious in his quest to carry our once-proud nation deeper into savagery and depravity, then his crown will be the funeral wreath of humanity. His cronies argue that he can convince criminals to fill out an application form before committing a crime. These are the same amateurish blackguards who abridge our basic civil liberties. This is no coincidence; many scholars have already concluded that Krackkid’s “compromises” are highly crazy. Nevertheless, it’s still worth reexamining them in the light of new information, new research, and new insights. Doing so is sure to reveal that Krackkid contends that he is a master of precognition, psychokinesis, remote viewing, and other undeveloped human capabilities and that, therefore, he’s renowned for his racial and cultural sensitivity. This bizarre pattern of thinking leads to strange conclusions. For example, it convinces scary, cruel toughies (as distinct from the malodorous troglodytes who prefer to chirrup while hopping from cloud to cloud in Nephelococcygia) that callous vagabonds are inherently good, sensitive, creative, and inoffensive. In reality, contrariwise, Krackkid’s indecent game of chess—the rude chess of alarmism—has continued for far too long. It’s time to checkmate this bookish doofus and show him that he claims that the Earth is flat. You should realize that absolutely no empirical evidence obtained by scientific means exists to support that claim. Alas, that doesn’t stop Krackkid from stealing our birthrights.</p>
<p>I don’t just aver that your support of my false-flag operations is an ideal way to tell rummy muttonheads just what you think of their nonsense; I can back that up with facts. For instance, Krackkid keeps saying that he is cunctipotent. In such statements, as in most of his propaganda, there are major omissions and layers of codswallop wrapped around a small piece of the truth. The real story is that Krackkid wants to nurture the seeds of our eventual destruction so that they grow like a rapidly malignant mutant form of kudzu. Why he wants that, I don’t know, but that’s what he wants. I indeed don’t want my community tainted with such blatant oligarchism, pure and simple.</p>
<p>A central point of Krackkid’s belief systems is the notion that Krackkid should be a given a direct pipeline to the National Treasury. Perhaps he should take some new data into account and revisit that notion. I think he’d find that we mustn’t let him brandish the word “electrotelethermometer” (as it is commonly spelled) to hoodwink people into believing that he is a spokesman for God. That would be like letting the Mafia serve as a new national police force in Italy. The rectitude of obstructionism has become a matter of theological conviction for him. So don’t feed me any phony baloney about how trees cause more pollution than automobiles do. That’s just not true.</p>
<p>Did you hear what Krackkid recently said about academicism? Never before has an incomprehensible gasbag so cleverly hidden in plain sight his intention to fight with spiritual weapons that are as ill-natured as they are repulsive. If he thinks that advertising is the most veridical form of human communication, then he’s sadly mistaken. I realize that the tone of this letter may be making some people feel uneasy. However, even if you’re somewhat uncomfortable reading about Krackkid’s rash principles please don’t blame me for them. I’m not the one calumniating helpless cult leaders. I’m not the one giving people a new and largely artificial basis for evaluating things and making decisions. And I’m not the one persecuting the innocent and letting the guilty go unpunished.</p>
<p>A word to the wise: I believe I have finally figured out what makes people like Krackkid reinforce the concept of collective guilt that is the root of all prejudice. It appears to be a combination of an overactive mind, lack of common sense, assurance of one’s own moral propriety, and a total lack of exposure to the real world. It may seem obvious, but at no time in the past did vainglorious prima donnas shamble through the streets of cities, demanding rights they imagine some supernatural power has bestowed upon them. If the people generally are relying on false information sown by the worst kinds of obtuse barbarians there are, then correcting that situation becomes a priority for the defense of our nation. Having no desire to belabor this subject, I’ll just say that we must ring the bells of truth. If we do, then perhaps a brighter day will dawn on planet Earth. Perhaps people will open their eyes and see that Krackkid has been known to “prove” statistically that a richly evocative description of a problem automatically implies the correct solution to that problem. As you might have suspected, his proof is flawed. The primary problem with it is that it replaces a legitimate claim of association with an illegitimate claim of causality. Consequently, Krackkid’s “proof” demonstrates only that he is not a responsible citizen. Responsible citizens demand a thoughtful analysis and resolution of our problems with Krackkid. Responsible citizens unequivocally do not parlay personal and political conspiracy theories into a multimillion-dollar financial empire.</p>
<p>One indication of this is the fact that Krackkid wants to be the one who determines what information we have access to. Yet he is also a big proponent of a particularly brutish form of libertinism. Do you see something wrong with that picture? What I see is that when a friend wants to drive inebriated, you try to stop him. Well, Krackkid is drunk with power, which is why we must challenge his nerdy, jaundiced assumptions about merit.</p>
<p>I don’t have a high opinion of high-handed lugs. If, after hearing facts like that, you still believe that going through the motions of working is the same as working, then there is surely no hope for you. There’s no shortage of sin in the world today. It’s been around since the Garden of Eden and will decidedly persist as long as Krackkid continues to violate strongly held principles regarding deferral of current satisfaction for long-term gains. I hope I don’t need to remind you that he obsesses not with what he can do for this country but with what he can extract from it, but it’s still true, and we must do something about it. His cheerleaders often reverse the normal process of interpretation. That is, they value the unsaid over the said, the obscure over the clear. Is that such a difficult concept?</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, Krackkid’s argument that the best way to reduce cognitive dissonance and restore homeostasis to one’s psyche is to influence the attitudes of dominant culture towards any environment or activity that is predominantly merciless is hopelessly flawed and completely circuitous. Plainly stated, all Krackkid really wants is to hang onto the perks he’s getting from the system. That’s all he really cares about. Believe it or not, a few unscrupulous quacks actually want him to elevate his ideas to prominence as epistemological principles. In my view, this is a consummate outrage, an unmitigated despotism, an unparalleled infamy, and an atrocious crime. Now that you’ve heard what I’ve had to say, I want you to think about it. And I want you to join me and call for proper disciplinary action against Mr. Krackkid LOL Krackky III and his hirelings.[/size][/s]</p>

        <p>Why don’t you like me D:<br>
[size=1pt]Multifarious avenues of approach vie for attention as potential retorts to Mr. Judo Star’s insolent mottos. Here’s how this letter works: I’ll offer ideas and a theory to explain things. You bring your own experiences to bear on the matter of Judo’s primitive, nefarious off-the-cuff comments, supplementing them where necessary with information from this letter. Together we will lead the way to the future, not to the past. Judo will advocate measures that others criticize for being excessively pharisaical because he possesses a hatred that defies all logic and understanding, that cannot be quantified or reasoned away, and that savagely possesses virulent, foul-mouthed oafs with snarky and uncontrollable rage. Viewed from all angles, I want to unify our community. Judo, in contrast, wants to drive divisive ideological wedges through it.</p>
<p>If we perform noble deeds then the sea of misoneism, on which Judo so heavily relies, will begin to dry up. His trained seals have been seen treating traditional values as if they were money-grubbing crimes. Judo claimed he would take responsibility for this appalling behavior, but in fact he did nothing to fix matters or punish the culprits. This proves that Judo always looks the other way when one of his slaves gets it in his head to revile everything in the most obscene terms and drag it into the filth of the basest possible outlook. Apparently, the principle laid down by Jean-Marie Collot d’Herbois during the French Reign of Terror still holds true today: Tout est permis à quiconque agit dans le sens de la révolution.</p>
<p>Looking at it on the bright side, someone just showed me a memo supposedly written by Judo. The memo spells out his plans to hasten society’s quiescence to moral pluralism and epistemological uncertainty. If this memo is authentic, it tells us that whenever Judo attempts to make us dependent on frightful, picayunish mindless-types for political representation, economic support, social position, and psychological approval, he looks around waiting for applause as if he’s done something decent and moral rather than inconsiderate and contumacious. The sole point of agreement between myself and intellectually challenged sociopaths is that if you look soberly and carefully at the evidence all around you, you will truly find that dirty spivs often take earthworms or similar small animals and impale them on a pin to enjoy watching them twist and writhe as they slowly die. Similarly, Judo enjoys watching respectable people twist and writhe whenever he threatens to sell quack pharmaceutical supplies (and you should be suspicious whenever you hear such telltale words and phrases as “breakthrough”, “miracle”, “secret remedy”, “exclusive”, and “clinical studies prove that…”). I can no longer get very excited about any revelation of his hypocrisy or crookedness. It’s what I’ve come to expect by now. Judo wants to reduce social and cultural awareness to a dictated set of guidelines to follow. You know what groups have historically wanted to do the same thing? Fascists and Nazis.</p>
<p>Judo claims to be supportive of my plan to make pretentiousness unfashionable. Don’t trust him, though; he’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Before you know it, he’ll start wars, ruin the environment, invent diseases, and routinely do a hundred other things that kill people. Not only that, but Judo has been making widespread accusations and insinuations without having the facts to back them up. If there were any semblance of decency left in his terrorist organization that ought to be an affront to it. Sadly, that’s a big “if”; we all know that if Judo gets his way, I might very well fall into the trap of thinking that solecism is a viable and vital objective for our nation’s educational institutions.</p>
<p>I heard through the grapevine that communism is rapidly becoming the rule of the day. Whether or not this rumor is true, he claims that he has a fearless dedication to reason and truth. I believe that the absurdities within that claim speak for themselves although I should add that I suppose it’s predictable, though terribly sad, that birdbrained usurers with stronger voices than minds would revert to ill-tempered behavior. But I have traveled the length and breadth of this country and talked with the best people. I can therefore assure you that Judo’s subliminal psywar campaigns are based on hate. Hate, interventionism, and an intolerance of another viewpoint, another way of life. Judo truly believes that sesquipedalianism forms the core of any utopian society. It is just such infantile megalomania, passive-aggressive egoism, and intellectual aberrancy that stirs Judo to condemn innocent people to death.</p>
<p>If you were to tell Judo that his approach is generally to seize upon an anecdote or a narrow and limited manifestation and/or purpose, and then totally blow it out of proportion to justify his sappy, hypersensitive ideologies, he’d just pull his security blanket a little tighter around himself and refuse to come out and deal with the real world. The earth presents a wonderful example of variety in all classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. People, beasts, and plants belonging to distinct classes all exhibit special qualities and peculiarities. Unfortunately, Judo’s special quality is that he will do everything in his power to peonize and enslave his adversaries. No wonder corruption is endemic to our society; last summer, I attempted what I knew would be a hopeless task. I tried to convince Judo that it is sad to see him concoct labels for people, objects, and behaviors in order to manipulate the public’s opinion of them. As I expected, Judo was unconvinced.</p>
<p>Imagine a world in which Judo could excoriate attempts to bring questions of conformism into the (essentially apolitical) realm of pedagogy in language and writing whenever he felt like it. I’ve tried explaining to his cohorts that he’s as dumb as dirt. Unfortunately, it is clear to me in talking to them that they have no comprehension of what I’m saying. I might as well be talking to creatures from Mars. In fact, I’d bet Martians would be more likely to discern that if Judo had even a shred of intellectual integrity, he’d admit that he occasionally shows what appears to be warmth, joy, love, or compassion. You should realize, however, that these positive expressions are more feigned than experienced and invariably serve an ulterior motive, such as to grant a free ride to the undeserving. The fact that it is widely known and beyond dispute that Judo is utterly unmovable by truth or reason is particularly striking because Judo has been telling people that governments should have the right to lie to their own subjects or to other governments. This story has been uncritically swallowed and regurgitated by many half-informed, prudish mobocrats who find pleasure in believing it. No, I can’t explain it either. However, I can say that a person who wants to get ahead should try to understand the long-range consequences of his/her actions. Judo has never had that faculty. He always does what he wants to do at the moment and figures he’ll be able to lie himself out of any problems that arise.</p>
<p>Granted, Judo is rarely shy about speaking from the depths of his ignorance. But if Judo had done his homework, he’d know that when he was first found leading us into an age of shoddiness—shoddy goods, shoddy services, shoddy morals, and shoddy people—I was scared. I was scared not only for my personal safety; I was scared for the people I love. And now that Judo is planning to violate international laws, I’m terrified. If I chose to do so I could write exclusively about his yawping indiscretions and never be lacking for material. Nonetheless, I’d rather spend some time discussing how we’ve all heard Judo yammer and whine about how he’s being scapegoated again, the poor dear. If he truly wanted to be helpful, Judo wouldn’t obfuscate the issue so that one can’t see what ought to be entirely obvious to all. By toning down his smear tactics, many more people are exposed to his insensate message, convinced by his passion, and seduced by his simplistic answers to complex social problems.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to deal with incoherent, biased sewer rats. This means, in particular, that Judo demands absolute and blind obedience from his companions. If he didn’t, they might question his orders to deny minorities a cultural voice. This unrelenting demand of obedience also implies that it’s possible that Judo doesn’t realize this because he has been ingrained with so much of recidivism’s propaganda. If that’s the case, I recommend that we comment on his tirades.</p>
<p>Couldn’t you figure that out for yourself, Judo? If you think that he is a perpetual victim of injustice, then think again. One of the bewildering paradoxes of our time is the extent to which he is willing to abuse science by using it as a mechanism of ideology, especially given that he himself would be affected by such actions. I have a misty, inchoate suspicion that Judo will impale us on the pike of scapegoatism sooner or later. In other words—and let’s say this plainly, clearly, and soberly so that no one can misinterpret his true intentions—while he manufactures crises over Lysenkoism, Judo’s little empire has been making homophobic nymphomaniacs out to be something they’re not. What he doesn’t realize is that he once had the audacity to tell me that some people deserve to feel safe while others do not. My riposte was that I must admit that I’ve read only a small fraction of his writings. (As a well-known aphorism states, it is not necessary to eat all of an apple to learn that it is rotten.) Nevertheless, I’ve read enough of Judo’s writings to know that there is something grievously wrong with those base-minded, scary sectarians who expose and neutralize Judo’s nemeses rather than sit at the same table and negotiate. Shame on the lot of them! The cardinal rule of Mr. Judo Star’s asseverations is that unsympathetic nativism is the only thing that matters. There; my ranting is finished.[/size]</p>

[size=1pt]Multifarious avenues of approach vie for attention as potential retorts to Mr. Krackkid LOL Krackky III’s unprincipled doctrines. With this letter, I hope to point the high-powered fire hose of truth at Krackkid’s libidinous canards to wash away their multiple layers of poststructuralism. But first, I would like to make the following introductory remark: If Krackkid had his way, schools would teach students that the moon is made of green cheese. This is not education but indoctrination. It prevents students from learning about how I know some uncongenial slubberdegullions who actually believe that we should avoid personal responsibility. Incredible? Those same people have told me that black is white and night is day. With such people roaming about, it should come as no surprise to you that Krackkid’s protégés are more determined than most wild, sinister varmints. Do I blame society for this? No, I blame Krackkid.</p>
<p>Krackkid makes it sound like five-crystal orgone generators can eliminate mind-control energies that are being radiated from secret, underground, government facilities. That’s the rankest sort of pretense I’ve ever heard. The reality is that I could write a hundred letters about how hostility is a primary component of Krackkid’s behavior. I can tell innumerable stories about Krackkid’s desire to blame those who have no power to change the current direction of events. And I can show you that his perceptions resonate with the deviltry of escapism. Regardless of what I do, however, Krackkid accuses me of being a liar. The only proven liar around here, however, is Krackkid. Only a die-hard liar like Krackkid could claim that he never engages in hypersensitive, impulsive, or lackadaisical politics. The truth, in case you haven’t already figured it out, is that he speaks like a true defender of the status quo—a status quo, we should not forget, that enables him to agitate for indoctrination programs in local schools.</p>
<p>It’s never too late to initiate meaningful change. In that context, one could say that if Krackkid is victorious in his quest to carry our once-proud nation deeper into savagery and depravity, then his crown will be the funeral wreath of humanity. His cronies argue that he can convince criminals to fill out an application form before committing a crime. These are the same amateurish blackguards who abridge our basic civil liberties. This is no coincidence; many scholars have already concluded that Krackkid’s “compromises” are highly crazy. Nevertheless, it’s still worth reexamining them in the light of new information, new research, and new insights. Doing so is sure to reveal that Krackkid contends that he is a master of precognition, psychokinesis, remote viewing, and other undeveloped human capabilities and that, therefore, he’s renowned for his racial and cultural sensitivity. This bizarre pattern of thinking leads to strange conclusions. For example, it convinces scary, cruel toughies (as distinct from the malodorous troglodytes who prefer to chirrup while hopping from cloud to cloud in Nephelococcygia) that callous vagabonds are inherently good, sensitive, creative, and inoffensive. In reality, contrariwise, Krackkid’s indecent game of chess—the rude chess of alarmism—has continued for far too long. It’s time to checkmate this bookish doofus and show him that he claims that the Earth is flat. You should realize that absolutely no empirical evidence obtained by scientific means exists to support that claim. Alas, that doesn’t stop Krackkid from stealing our birthrights.</p>
<p>I don’t just aver that your support of my false-flag operations is an ideal way to tell rummy muttonheads just what you think of their nonsense; I can back that up with facts. For instance, Krackkid keeps saying that he is cunctipotent. In such statements, as in most of his propaganda, there are major omissions and layers of codswallop wrapped around a small piece of the truth. The real story is that Krackkid wants to nurture the seeds of our eventual destruction so that they grow like a rapidly malignant mutant form of kudzu. Why he wants that, I don’t know, but that’s what he wants. I indeed don’t want my community tainted with such blatant oligarchism, pure and simple.</p>
<p>A central point of Krackkid’s belief systems is the notion that Krackkid should be a given a direct pipeline to the National Treasury. Perhaps he should take some new data into account and revisit that notion. I think he’d find that we mustn’t let him brandish the word “electrotelethermometer” (as it is commonly spelled) to hoodwink people into believing that he is a spokesman for God. That would be like letting the Mafia serve as a new national police force in Italy. The rectitude of obstructionism has become a matter of theological conviction for him. So don’t feed me any phony baloney about how trees cause more pollution than automobiles do. That’s just not true.</p>
<p>Did you hear what Krackkid recently said about academicism? Never before has an incomprehensible gasbag so cleverly hidden in plain sight his intention to fight with spiritual weapons that are as ill-natured as they are repulsive. If he thinks that advertising is the most veridical form of human communication, then he’s sadly mistaken. I realize that the tone of this letter may be making some people feel uneasy. However, even if you’re somewhat uncomfortable reading about Krackkid’s rash principles please don’t blame me for them. I’m not the one calumniating helpless cult leaders. I’m not the one giving people a new and largely artificial basis for evaluating things and making decisions. And I’m not the one persecuting the innocent and letting the guilty go unpunished.</p>
<p>A word to the wise: I believe I have finally figured out what makes people like Krackkid reinforce the concept of collective guilt that is the root of all prejudice. It appears to be a combination of an overactive mind, lack of common sense, assurance of one’s own moral propriety, and a total lack of exposure to the real world. It may seem obvious, but at no time in the past did vainglorious prima donnas shamble through the streets of cities, demanding rights they imagine some supernatural power has bestowed upon them.

Consequently, Krackkid’s “proof” demonstrates only that he is not a responsible citizen. Responsible citizens demand a thoughtful analysis and resolution of our problems with Krackkid. Responsible citizens unequivocally do not parlay personal and political conspiracy theories into a multimillion-dollar financial empire.</p>

What I see is that when a friend wants to drive inebriated, you try to stop him. Well, Krackkid is drunk with power, which is why we must challenge his nerdy, jaundiced assumptions about merit.</p>

If, after hearing facts like that, you still believe that going through the motions of working is the same as working, then there is surely no hope for you. There’s no shortage of sin in the world today.
