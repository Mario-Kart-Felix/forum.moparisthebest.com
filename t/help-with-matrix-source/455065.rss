    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-matrix-source/455065</link>
    <description>So, i&#39;ve done how to run the Matrix source (omg that was hard L0L0L) for my video.

But, i still have some questions

What are the moderators commands and Admin commands?

I want this so badly because i dont know how to give support rank, and donator/extr donator rank, wich is needed for my video, and i really want to know the commands.

If you now any command, post is please like this:

Moderator - ::(command) - (info)
