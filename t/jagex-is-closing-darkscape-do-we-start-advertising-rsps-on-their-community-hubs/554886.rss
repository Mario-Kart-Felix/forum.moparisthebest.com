    <title>Jagex is closing Darkscape, do we start advertising RSPS on their community hubs</title>

    <description>So you&#39;ve all been holding this &quot;mopascep is ded, wat we doe&quot; conversation for a while now well see this is an oppurtunity.

Jagex is closing down darkscape servers. Darkscape community overall is fuc[b][/b]king pissed.
Darkscape community has decided to stick together and might be looking for an alternative.

If you think they&#39;ll be hard to convince, they seem pretty salty about jagex to me.

So here&#39;s what I was thinking: Finish the goddamn official server and let&#39;s advertise to bring these people here.

              <p>The 1-itemers hotfixes was kinda funny. I ended up having like 5 or 6 addy 2h’s at the start by using magic to lure a melee guard to the swamp area where everyone was doing the free prayer exp minigame. Was one of the first to get the Mystic Air Battlestaff and managed to sell it for 150k (before people realized the guy at the tower can upgrade it for you after the quest).</p>

              <p>I was maxed in Darkscape and I had a fantastic time on it playing RS3 content. Jagex shot it in the foot with the choices they made. RS is inherently a terribly, terribly, terribly designed video game. They tried to fix a lot the core issues in Darkscape and it ended up driving people away.</p>
<p>I’m sad but I’ll probably just end up playing the last month and have some fun.</p>
<p>It was 10000000000000000000000% better than Deadman thats for-fucking-sure.</p>
