        <p>Hello my name is Nick I am 21 years old!</p>
<p>I have been playing Runescape since 2005, Rsps since 2007.</p>
<p>I guess you can say I have the dream of recreating Runescape like everyone else does…</p>
<p>I am not a coder… I know nothing of java!</p>
<p>I took html back in High school for two years forgot that all by now.</p>
<p>But what I can offer to a development team is the financial backing for what it takes to create a server to Hold 1,000 players and to purchase the website programs what we need to get it running so we can start taking in money after it starts.</p>
<p>I would like to get 1 Java coder on the team, 1 Html and mysql coder to make the website stick.</p>
<p>I would only like the best to work on the project as I will not need 8 people on the team thats how the client, server gets leaked websites hacked our money is lost etc.</p>
<p>I know we cant talk money on here but expect you will be compensated for your time spent on the project maybe an option of partnership 50% split if 3 people 1/3 split on donations premium etc.</p>
<p>If you want to know how I will afford start up for the project I currently sell Vehicles buying and selling at insurance auctions. I may be able to share some insight on that for a trade in some lessons in java!</p>
<p>LIKE I SAID I WANT THE BEST AND IF I CANT GET THE BEST I WONT BOTHER AT ALL. LIKE I SAID I WANT US TO MAKE SOME KIND OF FINANCIAL GAINS FROM THIS NOT JUST PLEASURE. SORRY IF THAT BREAKS THE RULES. BUT I ALWAYS THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE PAYED FOR THEIR EDUCATION!</p>
<p>SORRY IF THE GRAMMAR WAS NOT GREAT HAD TO WRITE THIS FAST!</p>
<p>MY INSTAGRAM NAME IS NICKLOKLOK IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT I DO IN LIFE!</p>
<p>THANKS PM ME ON HERE!!!</p>
<p>MODS PLEASE DONT TAKE DOWN POST WHAT NEEDS TO FIXED AND I WILL CORRECT</p>
<p>ALSO I THINK THE SOURCE WE WILL USE IS ARIOS 498 AS IT IS THE MOST COMPLETE IVE SEEN AND THE TEAM SPENT 3 YEARS ON IT</p>
