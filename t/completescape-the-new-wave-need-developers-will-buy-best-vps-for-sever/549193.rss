    <description>Hello my name is Nick I am 21 years old!

I have been playing Runescape since 2005, Rsps since 2007.

I guess you can say I have the dream of recreating Runescape like everyone else does...

I am not a coder.. I know nothing of java! 

I took html back in High school for two years forgot that all by now.

But what I can offer to a development team is the financial backing for what it takes to create a server to Hold 1,000 players and to purchase the website programs what we need to get it running so we can start taking in money after it starts.

I would like to get 1 Java coder on the team, 1 Html and mysql coder to make the website stick.

I would only like the best to work on the project as I will not need 8 people on the team thats how the client, server gets leaked websites hacked our money is lost etc.

I know we cant talk money on here but expect you will be compensated for your time spent on the project maybe an option of partnership 50% split if 3 people 1/3 split on donations premium etc.

If you want to know how I will afford start up for the project I currently sell Vehicles buying and selling at insurance auctions. I may be able to share some insight on that for a trade in some lessons in java!

LIKE I SAID I WANT THE BEST AND IF I CANT GET THE BEST I WONT BOTHER AT ALL. LIKE I SAID I WANT US TO MAKE SOME KIND OF FINANCIAL GAINS FROM THIS NOT JUST PLEASURE. SORRY IF THAT BREAKS THE RULES. BUT I ALWAYS THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE PAYED FOR THEIR EDUCATION!

SORRY IF THE GRAMMAR WAS NOT GREAT HAD TO WRITE THIS FAST!

MY INSTAGRAM NAME IS NICKLOKLOK IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT I DO IN LIFE!

THANKS PM ME ON HERE!!!! 

MODS PLEASE DONT TAKE DOWN POST WHAT NEEDS TO FIXED AND I WILL CORRECT

ALSO I THINK THE SOURCE WE WILL USE IS ARIOS 498 AS IT IS THE MOST COMPLETE IVE SEEN AND THE TEAM SPENT 3 YEARS ON IT</description>
