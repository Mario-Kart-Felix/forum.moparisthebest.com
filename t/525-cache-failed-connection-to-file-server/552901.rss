    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/525-cache-failed-connection-to-file-server/552901</link>
    <description>I changed the cache link because I updated the cache, I zipped the file as your supposed to everything in the cache folder make sure your in root directory. I zipped it correctly. Extension is .zip, I uploaded it to dropbox. Copyied link to clipboard pasted in CacheDownloader.java
removed everything ahead from .zip so link ends in .zip changed the signlink to read the zipped file name everything I done was correct. I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s not working.</description>

              <p>I’m also having this problem… Did you change anything to your mediafire link afterwards or was it just a normal mediafire link? Like, no autodl link? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Fixed! for some reason dropbox was the issue, i uploaded my cache to media fire and changed link to that and downloaded cache and unzipped perfectly and loaded. If anyone else is experiencing this issue just use mediafire.!</p>
