    <description>&quot;Rule 4:
We only have one forum account per person, you can use the same account for MoparScape, Moparisthebest and Mopar Game Dev.&quot;

Rule needs to be strict again, why are we allowing people to have multiple accounts when we have a rule against it. People get banned, come back 3 months later like nothing has happened. Yet some users like Lewk, Amerika, and Telenim are exiled. While we allow other users to use multiple accounts interchangeably. Discuss, rant, rave, hate, ect, ect. All the people with multiple accounts will most likely bash this.</description>

              <p>Tom,</p>
<p>I can see where you are coming from. What if instead of just being able to delete it straight out it’s like a “request” type of deal. A person would select delete account. It would go to a verification process where then the staff in their leisure would check to make sure that this is the legit person. I mean the only people I can really ever see deleting an account would be a moparian of some kind not some new first time poster.</p>
<p>That being said, a lot of us already have mods added elsewhere(facebook/skype/etc) so I would have to say as well that a staff member could easily ask if the account was compromised recently.</p>
<p>I do understand as well though your argument and do have to agree that it can be a security risk if not properly done. Just to give an example, I was actually questioned about L&amp;P on so many different sites cause it was such a long history. My only comment I could say legitly was that I have been a gamer for several years now and my name is merely posted a lot cause that’s the name I have used since pretty much the beginning.</p>
<p>Luckily for me they left it at that. I do understand though that my certain situation is like a 1 out of 100000 case so yeah I do see where you are coming from.</p>
<p>Other ideas:</p>
<p>-ghost delete (for the first 90 days after deletion ). This would be a system where all posts/topics of that user are backed up somehow and shadowed for a certain period length of time. By doing this even if the person was actually hacked and the system failed you would still have the posts/topics that could be restored easily by a couple of clicks.</p>
<p>-delete verification system  -what this system does in a nuwtshell is to have several different security checks to be completed to make deletion possible.</p>
<ol>
<li>Send an email</li>
<li>Have to put in the random generated value</li>
<li>Sends a new value to a secondary email that is ONLY shown on registration. These secondary emails can be changed via messaging an administrator and have similar to RS a waiting period.</li>
<li>Enter new value from secondary email</li>
<li>Deletion is pending/on hold for an allotted amount of time to make sure/confirm that it isn’t a hacker.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both above ideas are just my thoughts on how a system could at least started on something like that. I didn’t mean to derail this thread by taking it so far off course sorry! I know the administrators also have more important items to do then design systems such as this and this was purely an idea I had. If I knew this idea was a two thumbs up idea and that it would actually implemented hell I’d even offer to help pay for an actual developer to make one or both of the systems. Something like this would probably be around a 200-300$ figure I’d assume ?</p>

<p>I fully support though there should be an option to delete your account. Maybe even take it a step further to “wipe” all posts/topics.[/quote]</p>
<p>The way we manage account deletion is not going to change, it isn’t a god awful reason at all. Allowing anyone to remove their accounts is a god awful idea on so many levels, take yourself for example your hacker would of just deleted your account and you wouldn’t be getting it back. People would remove their accounts out of emotional hype and then expect it back in the morning. You may argue that we should let people do what they want, but such a function would be detrimental to the longevity of the community. We currently take requests for account deletion, but our policy is to answer no.</p>
<p>As far as name changes go and some sort of automated system with a timer, that would require code which we’re unable to commit at this time due to reasons I’m sure you’re all familiar with. I won’t dismiss the idea, but we’re unable to even implement it until the forum has been upgraded.</p>

<p>You seem to like being a fussy little brat and stomping your feet in public, so I’ll stomp my feet in public too. You’ve used your signature to blatantly lie about your current punishment, and discredit staff members a lot over the past few weeks. You’ve been gurgling out drama all over the place and dragging shit all over the community carpet - Keep going and I’ll make your signature about being muted forever a reality.</p>
<p>Let me make this clear: All punishments can be verified by other staff at any time, staff do not get name changes whenever they feel like it (A grand total of 0 have been given name changes since I have been administrator), and finally if a staff member over steps their limit they can be held accountable by an administrator. Understand, Ambokile? Good.</p>

              <p>I believe that multiple accounts shouldn’t be allowed, but I do think that we should have the right to the following things:</p>
<p>[ul][li]The ability to change our username. (Of course, there would be a time limit between each change)[/li]<br>
[li]The ability to delete our account, or at least request an Administrator to do so.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Some people chose their usernames years ago and it is quite possible that it reflects an immature part of their past, so many people share the same interest in changing their username, and the only current way to do so is by creating a completely new account, which just so happens to break a rule. Also, I understand that we, as people, have the right to keep our accounts, even if we aren’t using them; however, I do believe that inactive accounts that haven’t posted or checked in since the date of registration should be cleared out so other active users could have the chance of using the usernames.</p>

No, but when everyone gets away with the rule then there’s no point having one.</p>
