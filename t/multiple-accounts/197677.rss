    <description>It has come to our attention that quite a few members on these forums are creating multiple accounts. You should know that having more than one account on the forums is not allowed, and you will be punished. This rule has been with the community since it started, and it should be respected and followed. 

If you have not done so already, please re-read [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,4.0.html][b]the rules[/b][/url] of the forums.</description>
