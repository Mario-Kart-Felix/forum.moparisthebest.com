    <description>Right all most every up to date server base has lock on grathics but only the crap gfx void you can set the height what streams would i need to use to set the height of the gfx for each grathic? for alchermy and elemental shield ect.. i have just made 100% perfect high alch and low with all fire type staffs and fire type combo runes =] w00h! but the lock on gfx is at ground height =[ can any body help?

i&#39;m not a new coder so not a retarded idiot thats going to ask you to right it out step by step, i don&#39;t think any one has lock on height set grathics yet i&#39;m not sure...</description>

              <p>Well tbh, you do sound like a retarded idiot thats going to ask us to <em>WRITE</em> it out step by step.</p>
<p>First of all i have something to say. Learn english. Wtf is a grathic?.</p>
<p>Wtf is a alchermy?</p>
<p>And tbh, most servers have perfect high alch. It has been posted as a tut… As for the first staffs. PMSL! Congrats? Almost every rickscape source has it. ;)?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void bodygfx(int id, int Y, int X)

for (Player p : server.playerHandler.players)
{
if(p != null) 
{
client person = (client)p;
if((person.playerName != null || person.playerName != "null"))

if(person.distanceToPoint(X, Y) &lt;= 60)

person.gfxhalfway(id, Y, X);
}

public void gfxhalfway(int id, int Y, int X)

outStream.createFrame(85);
outStream.writeByteC(Y - (mapRegionY * 8));
outStream.writeByteC(X - (mapRegionX * 8));
outStream.createFrame(4);
outStream.writeByte(0);//Tiles away (X &gt;&gt; 4 + Y &amp; 7)
outStream.writeWord(id);//Graphic id
outStream.writeByte(100);//height of the spell above it's basic place, i think it's written in pixels 100 pixels higher
outStream.writeWord(0);//Time before casting the graphic
}</code></pre>
<p>No i’m not taking credits for this, because i didn’t make it. I took it out of a source…</p>
<p>I’m not trying to cause a fight or anything, but really i get pissed off when you have these people who can’t even spell easy english words. You might say you’re not english… Still, learn it. Like you need to learn Java. I’m not perfect at Java, i can admit. But hey, i’m alright… When your posting on peoples topics, don’t assume, read their post.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
