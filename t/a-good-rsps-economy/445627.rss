    <title>A good RSPS - Economy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-good-rsps-economy/445627</link>
    <description>Hey MoparScape,

What do you guys thing a good RSPS, I&#39;m currently making one. It&#39;s going to be based off of 2006 RuneScape, but it isn&#39;t a remake like a lot of people start and never complete. It&#39;s going to have the RuneScape combat and skills 100% perfected. But it isn&#39;t going to have all the other things. I will eventaully add all of the RS F2P Quests but that will be as far as I go. Now what I need to know from you guys is [B]What makes a good RSPS[/B].

Here are some things I have in mind;

- x7 RuneScape Experience.
- A really good economy.
- Hard way to obtain really expensive Items.
- No massive bonuses for donators.
- No half-assed programming.

So, please tell me what you think makes a good RSPS so I can think about it.

Thanks.

Thanks,

Skyro. ;)</description>

I actually have to somewhat disagree with one of your statements and that’s the using smffy and other things to make your forums. I agree, using SMFFY is pretty pitiful because you basically throw it up, but I used Forumotion for about 5 months on my first server, it was great and it still is IF YOU USE IT RIGHT. You can actually make custom HTML pages along with CSS. That’s actually how I learned HTML and CSS. :3</p>
<p>So the long of the short, if you use those site right, they can be good. But if you don’t yea it’s shit…[/quote]<br>
I didn’t post that part, it was a massive quote train we made one day that I saved.<br>
Free forums are pretty pitiful, forummotion is okay at times, still suck though.</p>

Change max skill level to like 199 instead of 99. Change xp rate to like 1000 or more. Add awesome items for when you do get to level 199. If a lot of players get max cash stack quickly just make a new item that is worth 1m coins and have them exchangeable.<br>

Going from 1 to 199 takes a shitload of time even with a 1000x EXP rate.[/quote]<br>
Is why you make it 10000x.</p>

<p>An economy is good, but to a point. Not where dragon scimitars are like 500k that’s a bit excessive. But a good economy is essential for enjoyment of players.</p>

<p>Small details add up, i.e don’t skip adding something just because you won’t use it or never use it, and then say everyone doesn’t.  Also, try and give correct staff powers, i.e, don’t let moderators do everything, they should be able to mute and ban at most, and they should be hand-picked by administrators rather than posting a thread on the forums.</p>
<p>In fact, I find many servers with bad staff un-enjoyable, mostly because if a player moderator has a friend, they can pretty much abuse all they want.  That’s because anyone can write an application and suck up in game, but few can actually moderate shit.</p>

using the whole rsmap, all ways of travelling, quests :D, minigames, unique features, no rollbacks or dupes or shitloads of bugs, awesome combat, a good community might help, staff know what they should do unlike most retarded,abusive staff on those pi servers, stable,ddos protected, 99% uptime server,  and alot of very small things can add up and make your server stand out (i like the small things example: desert effects, cactus cutting, rug travel in al kharid) just brainstormed some shit, might not make alot of sense lmao</p>

              <p>ravekitty is right.</p>
<p>In order to make (and what I may attempt to do) a “really good economy” I would try and make like an economy handler, that changes as items are acquired. I think RuneScape has something like this, so does other sources. But then again having it at 1 price could be worth it in some ways, because people would sell to the general store before other players and most likely it wouldn’t be bought therefore basically being wiped out from the game (if your general store deletes things after a certain period of time). That may stall your ptp trading for awhile though…</p>
<p>No massive bonuses for donors is another great way to go. Have their little perks, but don’t make it like most servers out there today, $50 for Dragon (or) Set, $100 for Party Hats, etc, etc. In the server I’m programming at the moment, we’re going to have a few special features for donors, and those won’t necessarily be items. Majority of the items will be able to be accessed by non-donors too.</p>
<p>x7 XP probably isn’t the best way to go… I have an idea for this, but I’m not willing to share it in public <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> (Want it PM me…</p>
<p>People could give 2 shits if the programmings good or not… Look at the servers these days, almost all leeched HyBriD PvPs that lag out every 5 - 10 minutes, yet they have at least 40 players on at a time. So that’s not something that would most likely attract people. As long as you can get it not to lag with maybe like, 300 people online at a time, they’ll be happier than they would be on the one that holds 40 players and dc’s every 5 - 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Don’t make the ways to obtain really rare objects insanely hard. I mean, some people want a challenge (like me) on RSPS, but then there are some of them that make it too much of a challenge that it becomes ridiculous to even get some good items.</p>
<p>Overall, your ideas are fairly decent for making a good economy server. I hope I didn’t leave anything out! :S</p>
