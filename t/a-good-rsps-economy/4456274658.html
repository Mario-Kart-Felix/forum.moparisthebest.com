I actually have to somewhat disagree with one of your statements and that’s the using smffy and other things to make your forums. I agree, using SMFFY is pretty pitiful because you basically throw it up, but I used Forumotion for about 5 months on my first server, it was great and it still is IF YOU USE IT RIGHT. You can actually make custom HTML pages along with CSS. That’s actually how I learned HTML and CSS. :3</p>
<p>So the long of the short, if you use those site right, they can be good. But if you don’t yea it’s shit…</p>

Why can’t I turn RS into a bureaucratic nightmare? The whole food situation is a nightmare. Raw meat is sold without any form of control. Milk could have be stored with camel dung without you knowing it. And then we have the inhumane slaughter of cows and chickens. Overfishing is also a big problem in the game, since there is no control of the sustainability of the ocean and rivers. If we don’t do anything about now, it could soon be to late.</p>
<p>So if you want to make a good server, do the opposite of everything on the 100. point list, and regulate the food marked.</p>
