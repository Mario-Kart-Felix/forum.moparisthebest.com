    <description>Wanted to post this in Server help, it said not to in the rules...
I don&#39;t want to post in the dead topic &quot;All questions blah VPSes&quot;.

Would I be better off hosting on a computer with 4GB of RAM, purchased in 2008 or 2009? Really fast computer, it got a virus, not [i]as[/i] fast as before, but still fast. Should I get a VPS of um.. maybe 512MB of RAM or a 1GB? My server has 40+ on weekdays, sometimes 70 - 100 on weekends, rarely 90+. It&#39;s PI... Should I continue hosting with the 4GB of RAM one or pay $25 per month for a 1GB one? I might get Linux if I understand how to use it. Never used a Linux, never used a VPS. Also if you could recommend a VPS site that would help me, I heard VPSLand is shit, I won&#39;t buy from there.</description>

              <p>All right. I installed Ubuntu onto a disk. It took a few hours, I had to keep switching computers. MY computer would never finish downloading it. My laptop wouldn’t finish downloading it either. They both would stop 10 minutes into the downloading… Never finished. My mom’s incredible (or what I think is incredible…) computer downloaded it in 5 minutes. So I downloaded it then burned it onto 2 disks (1 extra in case I lose the old one). I went onto my brother’s computer (he doesn’t give a shit about it, my dad calls it a piece of shit and could care less if it gets a virus - just because it’s really slow (from 2001)) and uninstalled windows (I have a restore DVD in case I want to restore the computer back to windows) and put in the Ubuntu installation disk. It installed. I’m using the computer right now to type this message. I’m trying to install Java on it… but I’m having a rough time. Ubuntu compared to Windows on this computer is 1000x better. Windows would freeze a lot and make screeching noises from my computer… and it was loud as fuck. This thing is now silent <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> – Okay that was a bit off topic.<br>
What I’m trying to say is, I’m having trouble installing Java. I’m reading off of <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,367407.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this tutorial of how to run a server on Linux.</a><br>
I’m stuck on part 3. It says, “<span class="bbcode-i">As you can see at the Top there is a taskbar very similar to Windows Task Bar. You need to click on “Applications” then “Accessories” and Finally “Terminal”</span>” — Understand that part.</p>
<p>Next part: "<span class="bbcode-i">Before we download and install Java we need to make your the “Repository” (a place were a lot of cool programs are held) is up to date. First of all we need to check that the server settings are correct to do this we need to type:</span></p>
<p><code>sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list</code>" — Did that. Simple…</p>
<p>Next part: "[i]This will open gedit (Like Notepad) you need to make sure the following lines are included:</p>
<p><code>deb http://za.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ intrepid main restricted
deb http://za.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ intrepid multiverse</code>[/i]" – It says make sure they’re included. I don’t have those included. It doesn’t tell me what to do if they aren’t added. Out of common sense you’d add them. I did that, continued to the next part, got an error, tried installing Java off the website, turns out the installer doesn’t know how to be opened.</p>
<p>If somebody can show me how to do this over Teamviewer or something that would help a lot. Thanks.</p>
<p>Edit: I think I have Java installed. Don’t really know… I can’t open .JAR files for ‘Security reasons’. I don’t know how to run my server. I still need help, if anybody can help me make a .sh file that would help. I downloaded Wine.</p>

<p>Can you show me a download link? And would I be able to chose from Windows and Linux on startup?</p>

              <p>Wanted to post this in Server help, it said not to in the rules…<br>
I don’t want to post in the dead topic “All questions blah VPSes”.</p>
<p>Would I be better off hosting on a computer with 4GB of RAM, purchased in 2008 or 2009? Really fast computer, it got a virus, not <span class="bbcode-i">as</span> fast as before, but still fast. Should I get a VPS of um… maybe 512MB of RAM or a 1GB? My server has 40+ on weekdays, sometimes 70 - 100 on weekends, rarely 90+. It’s PI… Should I continue hosting with the 4GB of RAM one or pay $25 per month for a 1GB one? I might get Linux if I understand how to use it. Never used a Linux, never used a VPS. Also if you could recommend a VPS site that would help me, I heard VPSLand is shit, I won’t buy from there.</p>
