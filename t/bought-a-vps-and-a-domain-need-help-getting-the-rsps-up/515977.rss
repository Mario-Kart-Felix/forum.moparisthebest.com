              <p>You connect to the windows vps through remote desktop connection with the login details the company gives you. Then when connected download no-ip- login with your details, download java again the most up to date. Then transfer your files to dropbox or mediafire, download them on the windows vps. The domain would be for a website which if you have the software and html coding etc… go for it.</p>

              <p>I’m assuming the VPS is for the server, and the domain is with the webhosting plan (having HostGator for example). You use whatever software that you want to use (vbulletin, Mybb, SMF etc.) and upload the files to the cPanel or FTP.</p>
