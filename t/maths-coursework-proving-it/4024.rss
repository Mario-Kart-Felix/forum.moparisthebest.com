    <title>Maths coursework proving it</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/maths-coursework-proving-it/4024</link>
    <description>right so i have this year 10 coursework that i have to complete early because im going on holiday i have to find the t total using the t number.

so i have a 9 by 9 grid, 1-81 and here is an example of a t

|13 14 15|
     |23|
     |32|
so the t number is 32 and the t total (all of the numbers is added together) is 97 so i have found that the forumula for this is 5N-63 (n being t total) but my teacher says that i have to prove that this formula works using algebra but i dont understand how to prove it using algebra

thanks

[br][size=1]Posted at: June 18, 2006, 03:48:03 pm[/size][hr]nvm i got it now :) i just had to say 

|n-19,n-18,n-17|
        |n-9|
         |n |
so n-19+n-18+n-17+n-9+n= 5n-63 :)

but now i have to find the formula for any grid :S

i know that i will have to use the size of the grid in the formula but i dont know how[br][size=1]Posted at: June 19, 2006, 02:29:25 pm[/size][hr]rofl ive got that now, im just finding it hard to explain it/ prove it</description>

              <p>im also in year 10, im doing that same coursework, the forumla for any grid is  Ttotal=5N-7G</p>
<p>look with 9x9 grids, tnumber=20</p>
<p>(20x5)-(7x9)= 100-63 = 37</p>
<p>this is how you prove this<br>
( ) means a box with a number in it</p>
<p>t=tnumber<br>
g=gridsize</p>
<p>(t-2g-1)(t-2g)(t-2g+1)<br>
(t-g)<br>
(t)</p>
<p>this is</p>
<p>t+t-g+t-2g+t-2g-1+t-2g+1   therefore…</p>
<p>t+t+t+t+t-g+2g+2g+2g+1-1   therefore…</p>
<p>5t-7g       ta-da you’ve proved your rule</p>
<p>now do some testing and you should get around 6,6,6. to get anymore, you have to have vectors, which are really hard</p>
