    <description>(Project 16)
Ok I know how to use ::object ... to spawn objects, i also know how to keep them there by adding them to the WorldObjects.cfg
I dont want it to lag because every 500ms it does the add world object command, Which is in the process().

Where else could i put this command so that the objects show up, but doesnt show up every 500ms?

If this is confusing i couldt think of how to word it.. lol</description>
