    <title>667 - Timer on attacking NPCs/Eating food</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-timer-on-attacking-npcs-eating-food/448973</link>
    <description>There is some weird timer while attacking NPCs or eating food out of the inventory. It seems that you can only eat food every 1 minute 20 seconds, along with attacking NPCs, there is a timer for it. It doesn&#39;t say anything, it just doesn&#39;t let you eat and doesn&#39;t let you attack a new NPC after killing the other one.

I&#39;ve googled this, searched all the files for 80 (1m20s), 80000 (80s in milliseconds), and I couldn&#39;t find any results that looked like they may be the problem. I&#39;m not sure what file it would be in, so let me know if you need to see any of my files to fix the problem, I&#39;m decent with JAVA but not good enough to find/fix problems like this.

Any help is appreciated, to make people more obligated to help, I can offer a reward/compensation, I can&#39;t give money because it isn&#39;t allowed on Mopar, but I can exchange for Website/Forums design (I have degrees in HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL), or GFX (I have an &#39;eye for design&#39;, and I do art work on the side). Thanks everyone/anyone that has read this! Comment or Private message me if you are up to giving a fix or some solutions to fixing the problem. - The Web Guy / AJ</description>

<p>Found it before reading your post, but yes, it was somewhat similar to that.</p>
