    <description>My custom items always go to my weapon slot. No matter what!

public static int capes[] = {
        14139,

I know how to add them to the items.java i even went into the client files and chaged it from &quot;weild&quot; to &quot;Wear&quot;. I tried everything i could think off. WHY IS THIS NOT WORKING!!! UGHHHGHGHGHGHHHHH!</description>
