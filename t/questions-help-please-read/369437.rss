    <description>Hello, I have a few questions,

1. How Can i change my logout timer.

2.How Can I Pretty much remove donator from the donator shop and make it require tokkuls.


3.How Could I make it so you cannot open the chest unless you have 5 pk points.

4. Im not sure if this is server sided or client sided, but when i click my special bar, it doesnt glow, like it usually does just stays plain, so idk if im using special or not.

5.Ive added the command ::drunk But It makes me look like im hovering when i walk, heres the command code:
[code]
      if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;drunk&quot;) &amp;&amp; donator == 1 &amp;&amp; playerRights == 3) {
            setAnimation(848);
            playerSE = 848;
            playerSEW = 848;
            playerSER = 848;
            playerSEA = 848;
            playerEnergy = 999;

            sendFrame126(playerEnergy + &quot;%&quot;, 149);
            sM(&quot;you&#39;re Officially Hammer&#39;d.&quot;);
            updateRequired = true;
            appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
        } else if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;sober&quot;) &amp;&amp; donator == 1 &amp;&amp; playerRights == 3) {
            sM(&quot;You Sober Up&quot;);
            playerSE = 0x328;
            playerSEW = 0x333;
            playerSER = 0x338;
            playerSEA = 0x326;
            playerEnergy = 100;
            playerLevel[3] = getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]);
            sendFrame126(playerEnergy + &quot;%&quot;, 149);
            updateRequired = true;
            appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
        }
[/code]

And My Server Base is 317, if you could help me with any that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</description>
