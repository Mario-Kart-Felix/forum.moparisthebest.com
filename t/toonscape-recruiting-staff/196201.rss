    <description>Well wehhai ! Im the owner of the living ToonScape Server!

Im here to recruit members for my latest server, if all goes well.. might end up making it live on a vps. Well lets crack on.. heres the outline and details.

Outline
Well baisically ive been learning java programming for around a year or so, and ive been coding parts of servers such as objects, minigames, commands..up to long quests and remakes. but recently ive been studying clients quite alot and seen that there is SOO much to do to become a successful coder, so ive decided to put together a team and see how things go. these are the areas i need to cover with recruiting staff

[center][u]Quest coder[/u]

Well these roll&#39;s are VERY strict positions. There will be alot involved within your positions. there will be a number of features that come with these roll&#39;s such as website,forum,server moderator positions and extra features in and out of the game aspects. simply fill in the form below to apply.

[code]Name:
Age:
Preffered roll:
Experience in chosen roll:
Will you be commited:
Msn/Email:   (PM me or email me)
Anything else you need to know:[/code]

Simply fill in yes/no or explain your position for your chosen roll and i will get back to you ASAP, note: im not going to be a lazy owner, im on quite alot and will be dealing with everything. i just want to let you know, please dont bug me as much as you can, if you can hold off the questions untill a decent time to ask then thats great! Much appreciated guys!
