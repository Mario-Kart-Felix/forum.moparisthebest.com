Where do you think I could sell a tank design, my father has been teaching my engineering and how engines work since I was a little boy and over the years I made blue prints for a light weight combination of an ATV and a Battle tank that is twice as strong as the military currently uses in the USA and would be 5 times as light weight. Also I cut down the costs dramatically for the shell casing on its bullets. Kinda scared to just go to the government or a military base cause I don’t really trust my country to not steal it and kill me to cover up the theft.<br>
[/quote]There’s this show on Discovery Channel, a small company builds innovative vechicles for the military and they demonstrate it, and if the army likes it, they buy it.</p>
<p>So before you could ever get anywhere with your tank design, you should make a prototype first for demoing, maybe tape it and send it to the military. I don’t think that design only is going to get you anywhere. You should watch the show.[/quote]<br>
Oh… damn, I don’t think I could afford the 500k-600k USD for a prototype, maybe later on in life haha, but I do have extreamly detailed blue prints and I built 1/12 of the smaller engines for the traction wheels.</p>
