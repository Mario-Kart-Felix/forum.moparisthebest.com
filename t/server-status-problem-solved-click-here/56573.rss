    <description>Hi,
Since many people are asking about what happend with the server status page, and where can they now find a server status page, I made a topic which will for once and all answer! Spamming just slows the forum!
So :
There are 2 forums(websites) I know, that have a server status with many already put up servers. Its up to date and works. 
1: rs-server.net =here you can register and put up your own server for others to know about(answering another question about&quot; how do i advertise&quot;)
2: dodian.com = another server status page, which also has many servers listed.

Please,PLEASE donot spamm anymore about this!
I answered for the last time and please also other mods etc., do not answer it again, cause it will make it worse!
Thanks
