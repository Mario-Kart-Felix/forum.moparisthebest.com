              <p>[quote=“Hellfish, post:39, topic:8854”]A leap year (or intercalary year) is a year containing an extra day, week or month in order to keep the calendar year in sync with an astronomical or seasonal year. For example, February would have 29 days instead of just 28. Seasons and astronomical events do not repeat at an exact number of days, so a calendar which had the same number of days in each year would over time drift with respect to the event it was supposed to track. By occasionally inserting (or intercalating) an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. A year which is not a leap year is called a common year.</p>
<p>Leap years (which keep the calendar in sync with the year) should not be confused with leap seconds (which keep clock time in sync with the day).</p>
<p>The Gregorian calendar, the current standard calendar in most of the world, adds a 29th day to February in all years evenly divisible by 4, except for centennial years (those ending in -00), which receive the extra day only if they are evenly divisible by 400. Thus 1600, 2000 and 2400 are leap years but 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2100 are not.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this rule is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>* The Gregorian calendar is designed to keep the vernal equinox on or close to March 21, so that the date of Easter (celebrated on the Sunday after the 14th day of the Moon that falls on or after 21 March) remains correct with respect to the vernal equinox.
* The vernal equinox year is currently about 365.242375 days long.
* The Gregorian leap year rule gives an average year length of 365.2425 days.
</code></pre>
<p>This difference of a little over 0.0001 days means that in around 8,000 years, the calendar will be about one day behind where it should be. But in 8,000 years’ time the length of the vernal equinox year will have changed by an amount which can’t be accurately predicted (see below). So the Gregorian leap year rule does a good enough job.</p>
<p>In order to get a closer approximation, it was decided to have a leap day 97 years out of 400 rather than once every 4 years. To implement the model, it was provided that years divisible by 100 would be leap years only if they were divisible by 400 as well. So, in the last millennium, 1600 and 2000 were leap years, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. In this millennium, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 will not be leap years, but 2400 will be. The years that are divisible by 100 but not 400 are known as “exceptional common years”. A mathematical formula used for this calculation is called “Zeller’s congruence”, which is also used to determine what day of the week a specific date falls upon.</p>
<p>The Gregorian calendar is a modification of the Julian calendar first used by the Romans. The Roman calendar originated as a lunar calendar (though from the 5th century BC it no longer followed the real moon) and named its days after three of the phases of the moon: the new moon (calends, hence “calendar”), the first quarter (nones) and the full moon (ides). Days were counted down (inclusively) to the next named day, so 24 February was ante diem sextum calendas martii (“the sixth day before the calends of March”).</p>
<p>Since 45 BC, February in a leap year had two days called “the sixth day before the calends of March”. The extra day was originally the second of these, but since the third century it was the first. Hence the term bissextile day for 24 February in a bissextile year.</p>
<p>Where this custom is followed, anniversaries after the inserted day are moved in leap years. For example, the former feast day of Saint Matthias, 24 February in ordinary years, would be 25 February in leap years.</p>
<p>This historical nicety is, however, in the process of being discarded: The European Union declared that, starting in 2000, 29 February rather than 24 February would be leap day, and the Roman Catholic Church also now uses 29 February as leap day. The only tangible difference is felt in countries that celebrate feast days.</p>
<p>A person who was born on 29 February may be called a “leapling”. In non-leap years they usually celebrate their birthday on 28 February or 1 March.</p>
<p>There are many instances in children’s literature where a person’s claim to be only a quarter of their actual age turns out to be based on counting their leap-year birthdays. A similar device is used in the plot of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta The Pirates of Penzance.[/quote]</p>
