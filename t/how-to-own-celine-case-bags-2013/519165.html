        <p>Celine Luggage Phantom Tote Burgundy Suede Leather Bag. the Phantom Luggage series is the celine another classic and popular styles. The simple design and practical space. Let captured the hearts of countless women.Stunning and flawless Celine Phantom Luggage Bag. This is the “IT” bag for 2011 fall that everyone is talking about and the wait list is a mile long! For a dramatic look, this bag can be left open with the winged sides &amp; tassels or you can close the wings so it looks like the regular Celine luggage. Make of burgundy suede leather exterior, suede interior.The most common ceiling that contributes to  fire-resistance ratings in commercial and residential construction is the dropped ceiling. In the case of a dropped ceiling, the rating is achieved by the entire system, which is both the structure above, from which the ceilings is suspended, which could be a concrete floor or a timber floor, as well as the suspension mechanism and, finally the lowest membrane or dropped ceiling. Between the structure that the dropped ceiling is suspended from and the dropped membrane, such as a T-bar ceiling or a layer of drywall, there is often some room for mechanical and electrical piping, wiring and ducting to run. The only child of Fernand Destouches and Marguerite-Louise-Céline Guilloux, he was born Louis Ferdinand Auguste Destouches in 1894 at Courbevoie, just outside Paris in the Seine département (now Hauts-de-Seine). The family came originally from Brittany. His father was a minor functionary in an insurance firm and his mother was a lacemaker.[2] In 1905 he was awarded his Certificat d’études, after which he worked as an apprentice and messenger boy in various trades.[2] Between 1908 and 1910 his parents sent him to Germany and England for a year in each country in order to acquire foreign languages for  future employment.[2] From the time he left school, until the age of eighteen, Céline worked various jobs, leaving or losing them after only short periods of time. He often found himself working for jewellers, first, at eleven, as an errand boy, and later as a salesperson for a local goldsmith. Although he was no longer being formally educated, he bought schoolbooks with the money he earned, and studied by himself. It was around this time that Céline started to want to become a doctor.[3]<br>

While hard to execute (at least in place) a decorated ceiling has the advantage that it is largely protected from damage by fingers and dust. In the past, however, this was more than compensated for by the damage from smoke from candles or a fireplace. Many historic buildings have celebrated ceilings. Perhaps the most famous is the Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo.<br>
