    <title>Protocol swapping?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/protocol-swapping/394385</link>
    <description>I just would like to know if this is possible. Let&#39;s say if you had an edited client. The client could read a 317 and a 562 server. A friend of mine is wanting to create a world for a 317 and a 562 and he is trying to figure this out. Is it possible for a client to read both protocols?</description>

</aside>
<p>Short answer: Yes and no.</p>
<p>It will require a lot more processing to be done by the server.</p>
<p>You would have to add the 562 protocol to the 317 client, and the 317 protocol to the 562 client.</p>
<p>You will have to account for the differences in items, object, and npcs.</p>
<p>You will have to account for the differences in the maps. (eg. the fountain in varrock).</p>
