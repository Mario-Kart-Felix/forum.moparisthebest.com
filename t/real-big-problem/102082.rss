    <description>KK first of all im wondering if testscape&#39;s smithing works before editing server?

cause myn doesent work..
i never deleted anything that relates to smithing. tings i did delete are just small things like the monster drops in item.java&#39;s
all there npc&#39;s...
and a couple things that make you req over level 99 in a stat.
most of them i actually just edited to go under 99 instead..

what could be interupting it?

and is there any version of full smithing i can put in instead?..[br][size=1]Posted on: May 28, 2007, 03:55:16 PM[/size][hr]Still a [size=16pt]Real Big[/size] problem</description>
