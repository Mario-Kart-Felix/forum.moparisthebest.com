Because coming up with your original idea is too much for an MMO, right?<br>
I’m not stuck in the past, but it’s not like it’s hard to innovate in an MMO.  Most barely differ from each other beyond subject and that’s what made the game stand out, being a little bit different, at least a little bit. not much though.</p>
<p>Who says they wouldn’t be here, though?  They were doing amazingly until they made loads of stupid decisions, even bringing RS07 is stupid because it can’t thrive with a community as small as it is.</p>

<p>MMORGP are generally not meant to be a fast playing game (in terms of leveling).</p>
<p>If you don’t want to spend time playing and enjoying a game (what? i know it’s crazy right?) then i guess a MMORPG isn’t for you. Go play a console game or something</p>

              <p>If I’m right… The XP rate was 4xp per 1 damage. If you wanted to completely replicate it, which you would probably get more respect for, I’d keep everything the same. If you’re wanting to make this server online and playable, not many people are going to want to play a server with original XP rates. Up to you. But if someone wanted an extreme challenge with low xp rates, why not just go play OSRS?</p>

<p>I’d prefer if it were dynamic and changes throughout levels.  This means that the early game content isn’t made utterly useless after 4 clicks why ensuring the rate at which you level up isn’t too slow.</p>

</aside>
<p>This, or at least if possible different rates per skill. The rate of fm compared to fishing or slayer is stupid.<br>
[/quote]Both of these are bad ideas.</p>
<p>First of all, it’s already dyamic based on just the level. Early game content is useless even in the real game, you can usually get 10-20 in certain skills by doing quests or spending 20 minutes doing something. Changing that to 1-5 minutes isn’t a big deal.</p>
<p>Different skill rates is also dumb because some skills are supposed to be slower than others. If you change the XP rate you will f<span class="bbcode-u"></span>uck the economy up really hard, they are balanced for a reason. The only reasonable change would be combat stats being a higher xp rate together than skills (but you’d have to make sure for magic it only applies to combat spells, not all casting)[/quote]<br>
The issue I’m referring to is that items that aren’t Rune or better are never used.  What exactly is the point in leaving the tiered system of weapons as is if you go from Iron to Rune in a matter of a few hits?<br>
When I first started playing the game, I remember having mith and addy for a long time.  Of course, training pures made me make my training far more efficient since I also has loads of more time, but even then getting to Rune was an achievement.</p>
<p>That’s why I suggest a dynamic kind of xp system, at level one the rate could be as low as x1, and then increase at certain milestones.  This means that all of the games items still have some kind of worth for a while rather than being flat out pointless without making people bored of them as it did in RS07.</p>
<p>I suppose one could argue that people are too lazy to work with lower experience rates, even at lower levels, but then you also have to question what the point of remaking Runescape is if most of it’s content will go amiss anyway.</p>
