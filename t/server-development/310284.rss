    <description>Hello,

I am looking for a server and client that may be rare to find but if it is possible to get or is already out please reply to this.
I am looking for the original set up for runescape classic.
PVP verison - With server set up interface as simliar to the easy rsc.
No bugs, No errors, no add ons just the original.
Everything 100% working.

------------------------------------------------
I would like to know if it is possible to make the item list bigger, in another words, If I would like to make a Dragon full helm, Dragon plate, Dragon legs, Etc Could I add to the item list and have it so I can summons or set up a drop for it as well.
------------------------------------------------
Client size needs to me bigger with zoom in and out, also probably twice the size of a original client as in web client.
Client Would have a load image + Login Image changes beside the images and the size.
------------------------------------------------
I would like to set up a pvp 1 on 1 or clan vs clan area as well, Others have said that it would be know as the pvp tournment, I look forward to have this available.
------------------------------------------------
Along with Pking events, such as at the castle, etc.
------------------------------------------------
Also to make possible a another island, or dungeon or a place to just train etc
------------------------------------------------
Basicially I would like to make a server that maybe the same as runescape once had running but with more add ons such as the pvp tournments and other type of cool features.
---------------------------------------------------
Tools would be nice to create the items as well. with ant built in.</description>
