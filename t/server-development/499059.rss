    <title>Server Development</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-development/499059</link>
    <description>One of the most time consuming processes in programming is the actual development of the application you are making, in the case, a private server. There have been many hours dedicated towards developing these private servers, whether the outcome result to monetary gain or just education. All of the bases that can be downloaded have started from one original developer, so most of the development is due to refactoring the base and trying to turn it into something completely different.

With that being said, there are obviously many different bases out there to use, even if they aren&#39;t a true base, but a simple refactor. Do you think server development should be continued, or should original game development be pursued? When I ask this, I mean completely new projects being started from scratch, which also means completely new protocol; however, thinking of these projects as remakes dedicated towards RS2 emulation. 

I&#39;m not trying to encourage or discourage the development of private servers, but I would really like feedback to see which side this community pulls toward more.</description>

The reason being that your imagination can soar as far as the moon when you create your own game, as opposed to programming a private server, which you are limited to using the client’s gameframe, and can’t, per say, make it your own.</p>
