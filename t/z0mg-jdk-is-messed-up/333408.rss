    <description>my jdk was messed up because one of the compilers from one of the sources i downloaded deleted some of the files from jdk... and it says i dont have jdk... but heres the prob:
when i try to dl it says it IS installed and when i try to reinstall it it just comes back to the message &quot;its already installed&quot; and it wont reinstall or uninstall and i cant find the files at all on my computer which means I can&#39;t delete them!... therefore i cant compile... 

HOW DO I FIX THIS</description>

              <p>Assuming your running Windows XP, and that it IS a problem with the JDK installation, click “start”, “My Computer”, on the left-hand side, click “Add or Remove Programs”, Scroll down to Java Development Kit X.X.X_XX and uninstall it, then reinstall JDK, if it still gives you a problem, their could be a problem with the JDK path in your compiler.</p>
