    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/530-construction/553159</link>
    <description>I decided to make a short video to show off my progress on construction in the 530 server base. I&#39;m honestly feeling too lazy to type out what exactly it has, so if you have any questions just ask and I&#39;ll respond.

<p>Besides that great job David looks like you have done a lot of work.I assume the interfaces are already in 530 or?</p>

Wow, this looks amazing! It’s been ages since I messed with construction, so this really takes me back.<br>
[/quote]I love construction and hope that some day it might be complete enough in a server to actually be feasible to play. House parties were my shit back in the 500/600 era and construction was my second or third level 99 on real RS.</p>
<p>[quote author=Lin link=topic=672075.msg4494828#msg4494828 date=1441152566]<br>
Will you be adding this to the official server or is it a side project?<br>
[/quote]I originally started it as part of the official server a long time ago, and you can see v0.X on the old repo. (doesn’t have the grouped hotspot support like the curtains/rugs and has lots more bugs)</p>
<p>I have no idea if it’ll get added to the new version of the server, that’s up to sini I guess. I’ll probably push the new version out sometime, but if it has to be converted to lua then I probably wont take the time to do that.[/quote]Yep, I can second that. Construction was my favorite too. Even grinding levels was fun, and it was always stressful dropping 500k on a room, only wondering if you might want to move it later. In regards to the official server, I’d probably be willing to implement it if you provided your code, since I already told sini I’m helping with skills.</p>

              <p>What I mean is that the custom map regions are meant to be completely independent; you shouldn’t ever even be able to try to load a new region while you are in one. For example in my construction custom region it’s actually only 9x9 chunks, and there’s a 2x2 chunk buffer of empty space around the whole thing to ensure the player never calls the region reload by moving. Obviously in actual Runescape they probably have better ways to make sure it’s never reloaded unintentionally, but if you try to reload the map while in a custom region without completely starting over you’re going to have a bad time</p>

<p>Strange…<br>
Because when I send a chunk that would be on/near the player (can’t really determine the ‘center’ of 8x8), it would place the chunk a (sometimes great) distance away from the player.<br>
It never really “centered” the player in the region like you’d expect.[/quote]The region is 13x13, the center being the x = 7 y = 7 (with one ‘unit’ being the 8x8 source tile)</p>
<p>I’m not really the person to ask about for details on the construct region packet for each revision though, in my server the way I handle it is by teleporting the player to my empty location (4000x 4000y), building the region (which uses the players location, it may be capable of doing it differently to avoid one of the two teleports), and then teleporting the player to the specific location inside the new region.</p>

I had a question though… On my server/client I was having a hard time putting the player in the region properly. I ended up having to teleport the player to one part of the region, construct it with the packet, and <span class="bbcode-i">then</span> move the player to the garden. Did you run into an issue similar to this, and if so how did you overcome it?<br>
[/quote]Pretty sure that’s how you’re supposed to do it; the construct region packet centers around the player and then you move them where you want them to be afterwards.[/quote]<br>

(doesn’t have the grouped hotspot support like the curtains/rugs and has lots more bugs)</p>
<p>I have no idea if it’ll get added to the new version of the server, that’s up to sini I guess. I’ll probably push the new version out sometime, but if it has to be converted to lua then I probably wont take the time to do that.</p>
