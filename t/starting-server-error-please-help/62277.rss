    <title>Starting Server Error. PLEASE HELP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/starting-server-error-please-help/62277</link>
    <description>[glow=red,2,300]Dilemma[/glow]: When I run moparscape the red bar begins to fill but before it gets hardly anywhere the entire window closes. I tried opening moparscape via the website and same thing happened. I have used moparscape and this was just a problem that surfaced seemingly out of nowhere. I was using it one day and then when I tried to get on later that day this error began. This is what it says when I run the batch file and the window closes: 

You lost connection while downloading a needed file.    
Please download it manually from:   
http://www.moparisthebest.com/cache/cache.zip
and extract the file to your c:/windows/.mpr_file_store_32/
folder. Then restart MoparScape.
Fatal error, exiting.
Press any key to continue . . .

Ok. I went to the site, downloaded this cache.zip file. extracted it and everything. Still didn&#39;t work. So then I deleted everything about moparscape from the computer and redownloaded it and redownloaded the cache file, still no success. This brings me to my hypothesis. Due to my account on the computer being limited, I logged into an administrative account and I ran moparscape. It worked perfectly. But since I&#39;m not allowed to use the administrative account I wish to try and fix this problem amongst my account. I believe that the reason is because [b]when I run moparscape, it tries to access my c:/windows/.mpr_file_store_32/folder and with me being a limited account it automatically blocks access to download to this folder.[/b] So is there any way to alter the source to where moparscape gets the source, because i have a .mpr_file_store_32/folder in my program files, (which i do have access to) and i think if i can let moparscape get the information needed from that file then i think it would work. So please anyone with any input would be appreciated. 

[b][glow=blue,2,300]Thank-You[/glow][/b]  :cool:</description>

              <p>well thanks for replying anyways, but I do have java. my main issue is the computer rights i think. moparscape can’t access the .mpr folder because its in the windows folder, which is because my computer accounts is a limited user.</p>
