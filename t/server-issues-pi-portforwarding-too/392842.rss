    <title>Server Issues [PI](portforwarding too)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-issues-pi-portforwarding-too/392842</link>
    <description>Hey, ok so I portforwarded a year ago succesfully, and now it doesn&#39;t work... (I accidentally deleted it...)
I have used Portforward.com and followed the tutorial, I go to canyouseeme.org to see if it can see me, it says yes, but when someone tries to login it says &#39;Error connecting to server&#39;, is there something I did wrong? 
My router asks for a Service name, and Server IP, what do I put for the server ip? My IPv4 or the IP I see on whatsmyip.org or what? It&#39;s really frustrating for me.. I don&#39;t know what to do :(

(something I posted on another forum)
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hey guys,
I&#39;m using the Exion client (PI), and I&#39;ve changed the ip to my no-ip, but it still only lets me log in, none of my friends.
Could it be a problem with my port? (canyouseeme.org said it was open)
My server? (runelocus.com said it was online)
Or is there something wrong with my webclient?
Maybe the IP was supposed to be changed in another folder other then client.java.. (doubt it...)
I just don&#39;t know whats going on.. I got a new desktop a couple weeks ago, could this have effected anything? (I host on my laptop, and always have)
I would really appreciate it if someone could add me on MSN (keatrm103@gmail.com) so we can have a real conversation, or PM/post here any instructions you could give.

Really appreciate it,
Keat&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

              <p>Yeah…<br>
Ok so I’m using Netgear WNR2000 v2 Router, when you add a port forward it has this you have to fill out:</p>
<blockquote>Service Name: (i put my no-ip here cuz i can)
Service Type: TCP/UPD or TCP or UPD (I choose TCP/UPD)
Start Port: 43594
End Port: 43594
Serve IP Address:(this is what seems to get me..): I put "192.168.3" which is my computers IPv4 address.
I think the last part is wrong.. but when I try to put my ip I get from whatsismyip.com it says you cannot use LAN addresses.</blockquote>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME!
