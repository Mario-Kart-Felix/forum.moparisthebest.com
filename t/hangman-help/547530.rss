    <title>HangMan Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hangman-help/547530</link>
    <description>Hello once again! 
In class we were to make a more advanced and better working hangman game in Java with Arrays, for loops, and such.
I have gotten almost everything working besides 2 imperative things.

I cannot seem to figure out how to prevent cheating when the user inputs the same letter over and over again to build up on the points.
This is code I have tried to use to prevent from users entering the same guessed letter over and over again to gain points.
I have declared an array.
[code]char[] gussedLetter = new char[26];[/code]
Then I used this for loop.
[code]for (int j = 0; j &lt; wordAnswer.length(); j++) {
				if (guess == gussedLetter[j]) {
					System.out.println(&quot;Sorry! You have already gussed this letter!&quot;);
				}[/code]
I think I am on the right path but just cant seem to figure it out because I get the output of..
[code]Sorry! You have already gussed this letter!
Sorry! You have already gussed this letter!
You have gussed a correct letter!
t _ _ t 
Please enter in your guess!
Correct Guess Count: 2	 Incorrect Guess Count: 0[/code]   

My other problem is that how can I end the game if the user loses? I got it were if the user wins the game will end.
But whenever I try to fix this problem it still outputs &quot;Congratulations, You have gussed the word!&quot;  

Here is my whole class.
[code]import cs1.Keyboard;
public class Game {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int correctGuess = 0;
		int wrongGuess = 0;
		int bodyParts = 0;
		char guess;
		boolean foundIt;
		System.out.println(&quot;Welcome to Hangman!&quot;);
		System.out.println(&quot;Please enter a word for the other user to guess!&quot;);
		String wordAnswer = Keyboard.readString();
		char[] gussedLetter = new char[26];
		char[] chars = wordAnswer.toCharArray();
		char[] blanks = new char[wordAnswer.length()];
		
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; blanks.length; i++) {
			blanks[i] = &#39;_&#39;;
		}
		
		System.out.println(&quot;You have 6 attempts to guess the word!&quot;);
		do {
			for (int i = 0; i &lt; wordAnswer.length(); i++) {
				System.out.print(blanks[i] + &quot; &quot;);
			}
			System.out.println();
			System.out.println(&quot;Please enter in your guess!&quot;);
			System.out.print(&quot;Correct Guess Count: &quot; + correctGuess);
			System.out.println(&quot;\t Incorrect Guess Count: &quot; + wrongGuess);
			guess = Keyboard.readChar();
			foundIt = false;
			
			for (int i = 0; i &lt; wordAnswer.length(); i++) {
				if (guess == chars[i]) {
					correctGuess++;
					blanks[i] = guess;
					foundIt = true;
					gussedLetter[i] = guess;
				}
			}
			for (int j = 0; j &lt; wordAnswer.length(); j++) {
				if (guess == gussedLetter[j]) {
					System.out.println(&quot;Sorry! You have already gussed this letter!&quot;);
				}
			}
			if (foundIt == true) {
				System.out.println(&quot;You have gussed a correct letter!&quot;);
			}
			else if (foundIt == false) {
				System.out.println(&quot;Sorry! That is an incorrect guess. Please try again!&quot;);
				wrongGuess++;
			}
		} while (correctGuess &lt; wordAnswer.length() &amp;&amp; wrongGuess != 6); 
			System.out.println(&quot;Congratulations! You have solved the word!&quot;);
		
		

	}

}
[/code]

              <p>I never tried your code, so I could be wrong. But if you try that out yourself, you’ll see if it’s what you’re after. Although, it’s something like that I meant.</p>
