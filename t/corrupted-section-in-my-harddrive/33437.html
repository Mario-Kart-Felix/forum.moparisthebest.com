        <p>Hey,</p>
<pre><code> I recently re-installed windows from a crack found in the tutorials section. But, the format directions didn't work, so I figured what ever, I can just delete the files manually when the new Windows is installed. So, I went to C:\Documents and Settings\, and then clicked on the user from the old version, and tried to delete it. But, when I tried it wouldn't let me. So I figured oh, that's cool, it's probably just read only. So, I unchecked that in the properties, and went back, deleted it, but it said it couldn't. When that happens I usually just delete all the files I can, and then I would find the file that I was unable to delete, and then write a kill script or something for it. Anyways, now when I even CLICK on the folder, access is denied. Some of you might be saying, oh who cares, it's just a folder. Well, some of the people who are saying that don't have 18.5GB hard drives.. And now I only have 3.52GB because all of the files are still in that user folder. Anyone have any solutions for my problem?

<p>I think I’ve had this problem before. Maybe you should try making a new user that has the same name as the old user.</p>

<p>Like Leader said, you would have to make a new user, but then, well…do this</p>
<pre><code>                       [center][b]-DEFAULT-[/b][/center]
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make a new <span class="bbcode-b">COMPUTER ADMINISTRATOR</span>, <span class="bbcode-b">NOT LIMITED.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restart computer and when rebooted, log on the new account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try deleting the folder from that account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that doesn’t help, maybe try logging in safe mode and deleting it from there.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">-SECONDARY, BUT FORCEFUL-</span>[/center]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Boot computer, press the F*(F1, F2) button corresponding to that which activates system restore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go through destructive system restore(you may want to save your files before doing so).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try installing windows again.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>OK, that was just a makeshift tut…But I think it may work(the default). If it doesn’t work, post back here and I will try to help…And if it does work, glad I could help <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>P.s. Why are you <em>re-installing</em> windows? you mean upgrading?</p>
