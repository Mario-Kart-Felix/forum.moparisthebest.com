    <title>Do you think sleeping is a waste of time?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/do-you-think-sleeping-is-a-waste-of-time/522177</link>
    <description>A huge part of our day (for most people) is generally sleeping. In my own personal opinion, I believe sleep is a waste of time and I try to avoid it as much as possible (usually resulting in failure), although I do generally get 8-10 hours of sleep. I&#39;ve been interested in the idea of sleeping less, yet more efficiently, without any luck so far. 

There are tons of different methods of minimizing sleep, but every single method works differently according to the schedule of the person using it. Anyways, before I get off into a different subject, I was wanting to see if anyone thinks sleep is a waste of time. If you would, also include how much time you usually sleep every night (or day if you are a vampire), or even post a schedule/method you use for sleeping.</description>

              <p>Yes it’s a waste of time, in my opinion. Some people love sleeping, some people sleep extra amounts (up to 12 hours a day) simply because they’re lazy. Then there are other types of people, who don’t have that much time to sleep, due to work or daily activities. The way I see it, I get what sleep I need to operate (which, for me, is usually 6-7 hours/night.) If I sleep more than that, it’s simply a waste of time, where you’re not doing anything, and when you could be using that time to do something progressive.</p>

It is really hard to force yourself to do something, especially if there are no consequences if you don’t. Do you feel rested and ready for the day with only 2 hours of sleep, or do you have to get up that early due to work?</p>

<p>Well given what I know about the bodies sleep process, I set 6 alarms spread in 15 minute intervals for 90 minutes. I set the alarm 90 minutes before I wanted to get up so I could get up when my sleep cycle was in the lowest state. I only had 6 hours sleep last night and I feel great today.</p>
<p>I have to minimize sleep this week (uni work etc), next week it’s back to 9-10 hours a night!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m just curious (and sorry for the late reply), but how did the naps work out for you? Also, do you think you could explain it it more detail, because I really don’t understand your interval system.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Well when you sleep you aren’t in a constant state of sleep. Your body alternates between REM, and light sleep.</p>
<p>Here’s it in a nutshell:[quote]<br>
The Stages of Sleep<br>
Non-REM sleep</p>
<p>Stage N1 (Transition to sleep) – This stage lasts about five minutes. Your eyes move slowly under the eyelids, muscle activity slows down, and you are easily awakened.</p>
<p>Stage N2 (Light sleep) – This is the first stage of true sleep, lasting from 10 to 25 minutes. Your eye movement stops, heart rate slows, and body temperature decreases.</p>
<p>Stage N3 (Deep sleep) – You’re difficult to awaken, and if you are awakened, you do not adjust immediately and often feel groggy and disoriented for several minutes. In this deepest stage of sleep, your brain waves are extremely slow. Blood flow is directed away from your brain and towards your muscles, restoring physical energy.</p>
<p>REM sleep (Dream sleep) – About 70 to 90 minutes after falling asleep, you enter REM sleep, where dreaming occurs. Your eyes move rapidly, your breathing shallows, and your heart rate and blood pressure increase. Also during this stage, your arm and leg muscles are paralyzed.[/quote]<br>
If you’re awoken in any other stage but N1, you fall back to sleep very very easily (lay there for 30seconds-1 minute). Whatever one out of the 6 alarms I wake up that I feel alert and awake, I get up. If my alarm goes off, I feel really groggy, I turn it off and fall back asleep.</p>
<p>My experiment worked exceptionally well. I was able to survive on minimal sleep for that week. I don’t think having “minimal” sleep is a good thing, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. Considering I get 9-10 hours a night regularly, 1 week of slight deprivation wouldn’t kill me[/quote]<br>
I really would like to try this out, and just to make sure I completely understand what you mean, let me attempt to give you an example explaining how I would like to manipulate your method:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Go to sleep at 12:00.[/li]<br>
[li]Set 6 different alarms starting from the last 90 minutes before I would like to wake up.[/li]<br>
[li]Let’s just say I’ll set my alarm to 6:00 AM.[/li]<br>
[li]This means I will have 6 different alarms within the last 90 minutes leading up to 6:00 AM.[/li]<br>
[li]Wake up during the alarm that I feel the most alert and awake.[/li][/ul]<br>
I’m not exactly sure if this is what you mean or not. Also, when you said you got 6 hours of sleep, I’m just going to assume you went to sleep at 12:00 and scheduled yourself to wake up anywhere from 6:00 - 7:30 (which includes the six 15 minute intervals). Is this right, or do you set the alarm intervals between 4:30 and 6:00? (I’d assume you meant the 6:00 - 7:30, so you would get at least 6 hours of sleep).</p>
<p>Thanks for explaining the stages, though. I guess that explains why I feel terrible after taking a short nap and it seems like the nap lasted forever.</p>

i do something similar for school so i dont feel like crap when i get up.<br>
basically set a few alarms and have em go off every 15 minutes and do that an hour before you get up. each time an alarm goes off you feel less tired. so after the last alarm you feel pretty good so you can jump right outta bed</p>

Well given what I know about the bodies sleep process, I set 6 alarms spread in 15 minute intervals for 90 minutes. I set the alarm 90 minutes before I wanted to get up so I could get up when my sleep cycle was in the lowest state. I only had 6 hours sleep last night and I feel great today.</p>
<p>I have to minimize sleep this week (uni work etc), next week it’s back to 9-10 hours a night!<br>

I’m just curious (and sorry for the late reply), but how did the naps work out for you? Also, do you think you could explain it it more detail, because I really don’t understand your interval system.[/quote]<br>
Well when you sleep you aren’t in a constant state of sleep. Your body alternates between REM, and light sleep.</p>
<p>Here’s it in a nutshell:</p><blockquote>The Stages of Sleep<br>
Non-REM sleep
<p>Stage N1 (Transition to sleep) – This stage lasts about five minutes. Your eyes move slowly under the eyelids, muscle activity slows down, and you are easily awakened.</p>
<p>Stage N2 (Light sleep) – This is the first stage of true sleep, lasting from 10 to 25 minutes. Your eye movement stops, heart rate slows, and body temperature decreases.</p>
<p>Stage N3 (Deep sleep) – You’re difficult to awaken, and if you are awakened, you do not adjust immediately and often feel groggy and disoriented for several minutes. In this deepest stage of sleep, your brain waves are extremely slow. Blood flow is directed away from your brain and towards your muscles, restoring physical energy.</p>
<p>REM sleep (Dream sleep) – About 70 to 90 minutes after falling asleep, you enter REM sleep, where dreaming occurs. Your eyes move rapidly, your breathing shallows, and your heart rate and blood pressure increase. Also during this stage, your arm and leg muscles are paralyzed.</p>
</blockquote><br>
If you’re awoken in any other stage but N1, you fall back to sleep very very easily (lay there for 30seconds-1 minute). Whatever one out of the 6 alarms I wake up that I feel alert and awake, I get up. If my alarm goes off, I feel really groggy, I turn it off and fall back asleep.
<p>My experiment worked exceptionally well. I was able to survive on minimal sleep for that week. I don’t think having “minimal” sleep is a good thing, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. Considering I get 9-10 hours a night regularly, 1 week of slight deprivation wouldn’t kill me</p>

<p>Well, if our bodies were able to sustain being fully awake for 24 hours of every day then we would continually be able to burn calories at a faster rate.</p>
<p>Imagine what we could accomplish if we did not need to sleep, or only slept when our body contained a lack of homeostasis. 24 hours of work, research, entertainment, etc. Sleeping would become a hobby or activity one could enjoy, rather than dread or find distasteful.</p>

I think you are forgetting that I also asked people to post information on their sleeping schedule. I’m glad you decided to change your reply from ‘useless’ to ‘waste of time’, because I never intended for anyone to think that sleep is useless, which is just an absurd idea in the first place. I hope this thread does not die, because seeing other people’s sleeping methods can be very useful information to people like me.</p>

Recently my sleeping pattern’s have been bonkers.</p>
<p>One week I’ll get around 45 hours of sleep (yes, 45 hours…)<br>
the next I’ll get 15 if I’m lucky.<br>
Some days I get 2 hours, others I get 10. It’s not actually fun, and it’s very hard to keep track when you’re up for 2-3+ days at a time. It isn’t exactly the best.<br>
While I don’t like sleep, I also don’t like the groggy feeling of being tired, which comes from lack of sleep and so on…<br>
[/quote]<br>
Not sure if you meant the 45 hours to be a lot, or a depressed amount of sleep, but I generally get around 4-6 hours of sleep a night during the school year, or 28-42 hours of sleep a week, usually depending on what I had to do that day, which is usually related to my job or just not wanting to sleep.[/quote]<br>
45 is a lot for me normally…</p>

              <p>Well given what I know about the bodies sleep process, I set 6 alarms spread in 15 minute intervals for 90 minutes. I set the alarm 90 minutes before I wanted to get up so I could get up when my sleep cycle was in the lowest state. I only had 6 hours sleep last night and I feel great today.</p>
<p>I have to minimize sleep this week (uni work etc), next week it’s back to 9-10 hours a night!</p>
