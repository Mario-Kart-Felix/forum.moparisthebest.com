    <title>Winning in flower games</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/winning-in-flower-games/382387</link>
    <description>After the return of the wilderness and free trade, many of you may have seen people playing something called flower game all around RS. The basic idea behind this is that there are six colours: red, purple, blue, yellow, orange, white, black, 2x multi. The person hosting the flower game shouts &quot;Flower game x[insert number]&quot;, the number behind the X being the bet to win ratio. Say that you place a bet of 10k with x3 multiplier: if you win, you will get paid 30k. 

Today I logged on RS with a 5m bank and hosted a flower game for about 20 minutes, and managed to clean this one guy. All in all, I won 28m GP in mere hours. I realize that most people can&#39;t be bothered with hosting a game of their own, which is why, even if you play, there&#39;s a way you can win. I said in the previous paragraph that there are eight colors: red, purple, blue, yellow, orange, white, black, 2x multi. Out of these eight, black and white are extremely rare, which is why eliminating them would make no difference. After this we&#39;re left with six colours, two of which are multi, meaning that there are two flowers: one has the colors red-blue-yellow and the other one purple-light purple-light blue. Since most people are incredibly stupid on RS, they count the multicoloured flowers as one. Because there are six colours and two of them are multi, by placing any bet and choosing multi all the time, you are bound to win, since the odds to win are 2/6 compared to the 1/6 of the other colors. 

P.S. I just tried it for myself and it works pretty well. Took out 10k from my bank and I&#39;m up to 350k after 10 minutes (I placed very small bets, 10/20k). 

Have fun  ;D</description>

<p>The problem in this game lies in trust… i was hosting a few games this after noon and i oversaw some guy get scammed out of 10m… some host was advertising 1m bet for santa (~1/7 chance of winning it, seriously high odds)… hooked this guy in, he lost a few times and ended up spending 10m before “winning” the santa… then the host logged out.</p>
<p>I cried a little for him,</p>
<p>Its for this reason that when the host does get a player they tend to bet lower than 100k because of the trust issue, which makes the game pretty pointless - i could make that much merching sharks in ge</p>

I bet red every time and after about an hour of small bets(10k-30k), I had over 1m in my inventory. I never really thought of guessing multi because of the 2/6 chances, but I seem to have great luck guessing red anyways.</p>
