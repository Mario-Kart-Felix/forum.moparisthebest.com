Guide :<br>
Register … then log in.<br>
Once logged in Click “Add”.<br>
Choose ur No-ip Name and how you want it to be (eg. <a href="http://No-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">No-ip.org</a> , No-ip.info)<br>
Then go to the bottem of page and go Click “Add”.<br>

Open up The No-ip Duc. and You will see somthing like this<br>
