    <title>Need help getting client to work for others</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-getting-client-to-work-for-others/404040</link>
    <description>I set up a server and posted the client. I can log into the server with ease but I tried to get my friend on and it always said &quot;error connecting to server&quot;. I was wondering if I had to link the client to the server or something since nobody else will be downloading the server. I set up no-ip for it and even but the ip into the file in the source folder. Please help!</description>
