    <title>Port Forwarding Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwarding-issue/393492</link>
    <description>I am unsure as to why this is happening. I have had many friends, Mendorphins, and Loveandpower try to help but nothing seems to ever work. I have set up a static ip just as a portforwarding tutorial instructed, I set up my router to portforward correctly. Everything seems to work out great. I download the pfportchecker, and even that says 43594 tcp and udp ports are open on my computer. But then I open up no-ip and use the canyouseeme port checker and it continues to tell me connection has timed out. I dont understand how 2 portcheckers can say 2 different things. I uppit a client to my friend to see if we can get him connected and nothing ever works. Im sure it has something to do with my porting. If anyone knowa the Windows 7 OS and would like to T.V. with me to help figure this mess out, it would be greatly appreciated :) thanks</description>

              <p>I kinda was thinking about the same thing. Are you talking client sided or source sided?</p>

              <p>This happened to me.<br>
The port on your server is different from what you are forwarding.<br>
I suggest: Find what port your server is using, and port forward that,<br>
OR<br>
Find the port your server is using, and go through and change every number of the port it was using to your portforwarded number.</p>
<p>Ex: For me the default port on my server was “5555”.<br>
What i did: I went through, searching port, and ip, to find it.<br>
Then, searched for it everywhere in client’s gui and client.java’s and source’s client.java as well.<br>
Changed to the port i was forwarding,<br>
Uploaded and it worked great!<br>
Hope this helped. (:</p>
