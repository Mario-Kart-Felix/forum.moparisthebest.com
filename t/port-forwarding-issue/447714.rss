    <title>Port forwarding issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwarding-issue/447714</link>
    <description>Okay so here&#39;s what I have done:
1) I turned off my firewall just in case it was on the way.
2) made a static ip address for my router so that it does&#39;nt change.
3) I connected with my router and port forwarded the port 43594 (667/711) server.
4) I used TCP port opener program that I downloaded from CNET.
5) I opened the port 43594 in it.
6) I went to canyouseeme.com and checked if the port was open, and it gave me a positive result meaning it was open.
7) I downloaded no-ip, logged in and put a check mark beside the host and it showed that it is running.
8) I ran the server files on that pc.
9) I then changed the ip in loader.java and client.java to that from no-ip
10) I tested the server on another pc with a totally different router, but the client is stuck at 1%.
Although it showed in the TCP port opener that my pc is trying to connect with the other pc.
Anyone got any idea how I might fix that problem and run the client?
Thank you for you cooperation :)</description>

<p>It’s these kind of programs that you won’t be able to connect to the server.<br>
Im sorry its the truth, you can use another pc (different ip) to connect to your server though. I would not recommend it but you can do it</p>
