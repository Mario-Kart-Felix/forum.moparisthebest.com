    <description>Hey guys, I made this banner for some kid and sold it for 9$. He seemed to like it. Tell me what you think.

<p>there’s absolutely nothing wrong with using gimp or ps for animation. sure there are better alternatives to using them, because other programs sole priority is animations, not image manipulation. but it doesn’t mean it can’t be done.</p>

I don’t understand why people make animated banners with GIMP and Photoshop. I understand they have the capabilities to do so, but they’re inefficient. I would use After Effects anytime I would make flash banners, and they typically would turn out quite well. Not near as choppy as when using the other programs.<br>
[/quote]photoshop animation is only choppy because people don’t take time to add the effects properly. they either have a too quick frame rate for the animation they used, or a too slow one. or perhaps they just move the text like 20 pixels each frame.<br>
[/quote]Yes, I figured that, as my Photoshop GIFs were never <span class="bbcode-i">too</span> choppy. Nonetheless, it is nowhere near as to what After Effects can create.[/quote]ae is more advanced, so obviously it can create better effects. i mean, it has support for c4d scenes as layers, whilst ps doesnt. anything done in ae can be a lot better than ps, but a ps animation isn’t bad just because it’s not ae.</p>

<p>given time, an animation made in ps can exceed one done in ae</p>

              <p>You can easily get the program for free. Learning After Effects is just like learning GIMP or Photoshop for the first time. Either way, I have also used Sony Vegas to create animated banners as well. After Effects just allows me to create more detailed animations in my banners. I suggest you use programs like that for animated banners. It’s a fun deal learning After Effects, I had a great time learning how everything works. Now I have a great time using it and making little projects with it.</p>
