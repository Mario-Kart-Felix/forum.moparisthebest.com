    <title>Running my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/running-my-server/109076</link>
    <description>Howdy, i have got my pimpscape source, added the perfect compiler, and i have set up a no-ip, i have port fowarded (I think it is done right), i have moparscape on my computer, i havejdk 6u1. I have all this, and i assume that my server is set up by now? 
But my question is, how do i log into it? I have tried just clicking &quot;start server&quot; on mopar client, and then logging in. But it only led me to the defult hybird scape. i tried typing my no-ip into the ip section, and it had error, i tried my computers IP adress and it just said error. (I DO HAVE THE RUN happining in the perfect compiler when i try it.)
Ca anyone please tell me how it is done?

P.S ( last year some time when i one all this private server things it was as simple as after getting no-ip and running the bat, and then clicking start server on morpar client, an logging in. and i would log into it.)</description>
