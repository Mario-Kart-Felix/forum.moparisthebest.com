        <p>Doubting evolution is like believing the earth is flat</p>
<p>Ironically, the Bible describes the earth as round and hanging in space—long before this could have been directly observed (<a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nkjv/Job 26.10" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Job 26:10</a>; <a href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/nkjv/Isaiah 40.22" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Isaiah 40:22</a>). The appeal of this claim is that it stereotypes creationists as stuck in the past, since the common assumption is that people once universally believed the earth was flat before science “proved” otherwise (which wasn’t the case—only a few bought into the idea that the earth was flat). But even if this were true (<a href="http://www.creationresearch.org/creation_matters/97/cm9711.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">it’s not</a>), direct, repeatable observation shows us the earth is round and orbiting the sun. Evolutionary stories about fossils are not direct observations; they’re assumption-based beliefs.</p>

The lord created us so he could TEST  us. So he could test us whether we would enter the hell, or the heavens above. And if he stopped the massacer of the creations he made, he would have had no purpose in creating us all if he were just going to save us, am i not correct?</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/dragonfire.html">@dragonfire</a> if there is no god, then how come good things that are miracles happen? you want us to think MAN did that on our own?, or just base that are luck? Yes LOADS of bad things happen, like murders…fires…etc, but thats because of humans…and for Americans we got fatness to blame on mc Donalds…</p>

</aside>
<p>if god was this all powerful being why would he remain on the sideline and watch the destruction of his own creation?<br>
also: being fat is because of poor personal choice, not some fast food restaurant.</p>

<p>The lord created us so he could TEST  us. So he could test us whether we would enter the hell, or the heavens above. And if he stopped the massacer of the creations he made, he would have had no purpose in creating us all if he were just going to save us, am i not correct?<br>
[/quote]Based on your religion, yes you’re correct. If it were trialled in court people would laugh at you. No one has proof for anything.</p>
<p>I have no problem with strongly religious people, except when they express their beliefs so valiantly and open as if they were writing a novel. Get to the point without the pretty details, because the non-believers don’t have the stomach for it.</p>

But he doesn’t just remain on the sideline, he performs miracles everyday.<br>

I don’t really give a damn what you people say can’t be ‘proven’ because it has been proven enough for me.[/quote]You’re freaking out, chill. I’m just suggesting. Someone could have seen the same damn thing and said “Omg there’s a scientific discovery to be made here” rather than, “I’ve just seen a miracle”. It’s a matter of who was there first and who tells the better story. And to be honest, scientists usually have records and evidence of most of their stuff while the religious half carries nothing but their word.</p>

<p>I have <span class="bbcode-b">seen</span> these things with my own eyes. I don’t really give a damn what you people say can’t be ‘proven’ because it has been proven enough for me.<br>
[/quote]You’re freaking out, chill. I’m just suggesting. Someone could have seen the same damn thing and said “Omg there’s a scientific discovery to be made here” rather than, “I’ve just seen a miracle”. It’s a matter of who was there first and who tells the better story. And to be honest, scientists usually have records and evidence of most of their stuff while the religious half carries nothing but their word.[/quote]</p>
<p>this is the exact reason people believe in science not religion.</p>
