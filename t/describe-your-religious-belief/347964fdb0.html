        <p>[quote=Exhibit A]What would happen if we get down on our knees and pray to God in this way:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Dear God, almighty, all-powerful, all-loving creator of the universe, we pray to you to cure every case of cancer on this planet tonight. We pray in faith, knowing you will bless us as you describe in Matthew 7:7, Matthew 17:20, Matthew 21:21, Mark 11:24, John 14:12-14, Matthew 18:19 and James 5:15-16. In Jesus’ name we pray, Amen.</span></p>
<p>We pray sincerely, knowing that when God answers this completely heartfelt, unselfish, non-materialistic prayer, it will glorify God and help millions of people in remarkable ways. Will anything happen? No. Of course not.</p>
<p>This is very odd. Jesus makes specific promises in the Bible about how prayer is supposed to work. Jesus says in many different places that he and God will answer your prayers. And Christians believe Jesus – according to this recent article, “54% of American adults believe the Bible is literally true.” In some areas of the country the number goes as high as 75%.</p>
<p>If the Bible is literally true, then something is seriously amiss. Simply look at the facts. In Matthew 7:7 Jesus says:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Or what man of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!</span></p>
<p>If “every one who asks receives”, then if we ask for cancer to be cured, it should be cured. Right? If “our Father who is in heaven gives good things to those who ask him”, then if we ask him to cure cancer, he should cure it. Right? And yet nothing happens.</p>
<p>In Matthew 17:20 Jesus says:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">For truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.<br>
If “nothing will be impossible to you”, then if we ask to cure cancer tonight, cancer should disappear. Right? Yet nothing happens. Note that if we take the Bible less-than-literally here, the statement “nothing will be impossible to you” becomes “lots of things will be impossible to you,” and that would mean that Jesus is lying.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">In Matthew 21:21:</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.</span></p>
<p>If “you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer”, then if we ask to cure cancer tonight, cancer should dissappear. Right? Yet nothing happens. Note again that there is not a non-literal way to interpret “you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer”, unless you replace “whatever” with “nothing” or “little.”</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The message is reiterated Mark 11:24:</span></p>
<p>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.<br>
If God says, “believe that you have received it, and it will be yours,” and if we believe in God and his power, then what should happen if we pray to cure cancer tonight? It should be cured. Either that, or God is lying.<br>
In John chapter 14, verses 12 through 14, Jesus tells all of us just how easy prayer can be:</p>
<p>“I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.” [ref]</p>
<p>Look at how direct this statement is: “You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.” This is the “Son of God” speaking. Have we taken him “too literally?” No. This is a simple, unambiguous statement. Have we taken his statement “out of context?” No - Jesus uses the word anyone. Yet Jesus’ statement is obviously false. Because when we ask God to cure cancer tonight, nothing happens. We see the same thing over and over again…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">In Matthew 18:19</span> Jesus says:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</span></p>
<p>In <span class="bbcode-b">James 5:15-16</span> the Bible says:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up. If he has sinned, he will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">In Mark 9:23</span>:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">All things are possible to him who believes.</span></p>
<p>In <span class="bbcode-b">Luke 1:37</span>:<br>
For with God nothing will be impossible.</p>
<p>Nothing could be simpler or clearer than Jesus’ promises about prayer in the Bible. Yet, when we pray to eliminate cancer, nothing happens. And keep in mind that this is Jesus talking here. These are not the words of human beings. These are not the words of “inspired” human beings. These are supposedly the words of God himself, incarnated in a human body. Jesus is supposed to be a perfect, sinless being. And yet, it is obvious that Jesus is lying. What Jesus says is clearly incorrect.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.godisimaginary.com/gif/jesus-perfect-truth.gif" alt width="320" height="195"></p>
<p>Jesus is supposed to be God. God is supposed to be perfect. When Jesus speaks, he should speak the truth. Yet when we look at what Jesus says about prayer, <span class="bbcode-b">he is clearly lying.</span></p>
<p>If you would like additional proof, gather a million faithful believers together into a giant prayer circle. Have them all pray together in Jesus’ name that God cures every case of cancer on the planet tomorrow. Pray sincerely, knowing that when God answers this completely heartfelt, unselfish, non-materialistic prayer, it will glorify God and help millions of people in remarkable ways. Now, we certainly have two or more people gathered together, and they have asked in Jesus’ name, and we have not one but a million faithful believers who, by definition, have faith and believe. We have fulfilled every one of Jesus’ requirements.</p>
<p>Will Jesus answer the prayer now? Of course not. Your prayer will go unanswered, in direct defiance to Jesus’ promises in the Bible. In fact, if you pray for anything that is impossible, your prayer will always go unanswered.</p>
<p>If you are an intelligent, rational human being, all of the examples mentioned above show you that the God of the Bible is imaginary. What Jesus says about prayer in the Bible clearly is not true.</p>

[/quote][/quote]In that quote, they lie to the reader. They manipulate the Word in as many ways as possible to try to prove God doesn’t exist. Cancer is very materialistic in itself, as are most things people pray for now adays.<br>
Go to church, the miracles that faithful people get will astound you. But the modern day non-believers turn a blind eye to anything that might relate to something they cant explain.</p>

God is the creator of all. how do u think humans were created? not by SCIENCE. but by God. im not trying to say, that Islam is better than all religions, im saying its common sense who the creator is. some people may believe otherwise, but thats their choice</p>
