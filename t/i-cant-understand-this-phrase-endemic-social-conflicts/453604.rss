    <title>I can&#39;t understand this phrase: &quot;endemic social conflicts&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-cant-understand-this-phrase-endemic-social-conflicts/453604</link>
    <description>[size=14pt]The whole sentence is: &quot;The primary reason for these French failures was internal disunity caused by [b]endemic social conflicts[/b].[/size]

I have search the definition of each word, and tried to put the meanings together, but I am still having trouble figuring out what that means.</description>
