    <title>[PI]Problem with modified quest[PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-problem-with-modified-quest-pi/397072</link>
    <description>Okay, so today I added a new quest to my rsps. Its called the &quot;Nut Hunt&quot;. There is a Monkey&#39;s Uncle asking you to pick 1000 monkey nuts from down the manhole. But.. You know when you start a quest. It would usually not tell you what to do again and it would have a different dialogue. Well.. You can just keep doing my quest over and over again. It gives you the items and deletes the 1000 monkey nuts noted. But I don&#39;t know how to make it so after you have spoke to him once, you can&#39;t make him say that again on the same account.. Instead it would say, &quot;Hey! Aren&#39;t you supposed to be hurrying with those nuts!&quot;. Please help.

EDIT: [img]http://i55.tinypic.com/2je8xom.jpg[/img] This is my quest tab
How do I change the name of &quot;The Knight&#39;s Sword&quot; to something like this.
