    <description>How would you change teleports in project insanity? Like I want to enable a bosses command for the falador teleport icon, and so on for the other 2 spellbooks, that will teleport someone to 5 different options they can choose like, King Black Dragon, Kalphite Queen, Chaos Elemental, Bork, and Barrelchest.

I know I have to do something with ClickingButtons.java and config.java, but what do I have to do? Please give me an example and explain thanks very much!</description>
