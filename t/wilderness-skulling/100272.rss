    <title>Wilderness ! Skulling!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wilderness-skulling/100272</link>
    <description>Hi , im just exploring my server to see what it has and i went to the agility place at the back of the wildy, went down a ladder i&#39;d found and instead of in the bottom right corner, it says Valentine with a skull above it, it said (once i was down the ladder) Level: 56 and went down to 55 as i went south etc. I was wondering how i could have it like that for all the wildy, and also if its even possible to &#39;Skull&#39; when you attack someone and it goes off when you log out. 

AND, how do i make safe zones , because i have volcomscape and its pking around varrock but i want it to be safe everywhere apart from the actual wildy, and i want a command to take you to edge where you can realistic pk :) 

Thanks! -- Val.</description>
