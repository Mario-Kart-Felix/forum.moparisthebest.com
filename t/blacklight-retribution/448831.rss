    <title>Blacklight Retribution</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/blacklight-retribution/448831</link>
    <description>This game is surprisingly a good FPS, it&#39;s a. F2P model which would initially put me off and I agree the in game prices for things to buy is fucking retarded not to mention this whole stupid renting system and the fact that you don&#39;t ever actually keep anything unless you pay ( from what I&#39;ve experienced so far) but the game itself is a solid shooter, it plays really well.

 It also has a boatload of weapon customisation down to things such as muzzle and the stock. It allows you to build your perfect weapon from parts, the bad thing is the parts have to be rented or paid to be permanently unlocked and parts for guns are way too over priced imo. Overall though if you play for fun and get a good build going you can just re rent them everyday if you play a good few games. 

Normally you have to grind loads for stuff but you can earn enough points to rent a good gun for a day in a single game if you play well, and if you are playing more than 2 games a day that&#39;s easily done. It&#39;s worth trying, it&#39;s not an arena shooter, more the modern type of shooter, no regenerating health as well which is good!</description>

              <p>Played this game, very unique and had a blast for a whole two weeks.</p>
<p>During the beta they gave away free Z thingies to buy stuff, and I tested out different builds.  The most fun I had was buying all speed armor with the cloaking device perk and the Desert Eagle.  Sort of like the Spy on TF2.  Sneak and sprint around the whole map and just headshot kids, or twoshot them nonetheless.  Shotguns worked as well but not as fast and had less range just in case you got caught far away.  Allowing your secondaries like handguns and shotguns to have scopes was pretty badass and bad at the same time.</p>
<p>If you just wanted to have the rambo play style, full armor build with a shield and SMG with incendiary ammo worked best for just skirmishing any player you see.</p>
<p>Playing Warface atm, I like CryEngine a lot better than Unreal Tournament’s.  It strays from the “F2P Feel” and felt kind of spoiled that it was free.  It was gorgeous and had a great system, unlike those bigger free titles such as A.V.A or Soldier Front or Combat Arms.  It plays a whole lot like Call of Duty without that “missing feeling” that other F2P titles fail to have, and has amazing object mechanics.  The maps are extremely detailed which I like.  You play A.V.A or Combat Arms and there’s little buildings with unnecessary crates or barrels everywhere with random hay, no environment, just a ground.  Blacklight Retribution is also on a higher level of object placement and map design, but still falls off a bit to Warface.</p>
<p>No automatic health regeneration on Warface either, but they do have Medics and Engineers which can restore other player’s (as well as their own) health and armor, respectively.</p>
<p>Just wait your two weeks, and if you’re still talking and blasting about it, looks like you found your game.</p>
