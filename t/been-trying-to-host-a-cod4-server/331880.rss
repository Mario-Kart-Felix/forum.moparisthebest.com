    <title>Been trying to host a cod4 server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/been-trying-to-host-a-cod4-server/331880</link>
    <description>kso, as you may have read I&#39;ve been developing a call of duty 4 server.

shit&#39;s fucking retarded though. Let me explain my problem:

People try to connect, doesn&#39;t work. Yes, ports are forwarded, no firewall.

here&#39;s the weirder thing, I can connect through 127.0.0.1, though not my IP address, and when I try to check if the port is open on some website like Is this port open, it says it&#39;s open. And I get a connection attempt from their website.

so
wat
