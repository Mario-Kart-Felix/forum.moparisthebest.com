    <title>My main was banned also &quot;o well&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-main-was-banned-also-o-well/2011</link>
    <description>Ive never really posted in this forums just kinda read topics and such, today my main (level 77) (989 total) was banned! I also mis-entered my appeal by pressing enter.  :mad:  But i want to inform you guys that ive been auto&#39;ing on my main for about 5 days now, and its pretty impressive that they caught me that fast. I was using Aryan /flax() script only too. Anyways, this is just a small warning, i think jagex is up to somthing cause someone on the forum got banned and 2 RL friends i know got banned today also. I think im going to quit runescape for a while, i think i might do the same thing as the other guy on here that got banned (Making lot of bots in free2play) Good luck to you all on scripting/macroing, this website helped me alot, especially the script tut&#39;s and such, also a shout out to Mopar, NICE server Client and Aryan updater You PWN Jagex! You guys might find me on Uber server. *Auto&#39;er 4 Life*  --Polaris

Still, i was making LOTS of cash, for the 5 days that i did auto i made 4.5m (Sold roughly 45000 flax)(About 9k flax a day)</description>

<p>Also, if you didn’t know, most of us have had many lvl 3’s banned. Getting banned for Aryan is not IF, but WHEN you get banned. Always look at it that way. If you value an account, never auto it or interact with your bots in any way.</p>

Thanks, i understand scar/aryan lots more!  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> So Jagex basically can see those varialbe changes in Aryan.

Lol, the only problem i had with /flax() was that it didnt bank anyother items except flax, i also tryed /imp_flax() but that one had some location problems (Walking in circles in flax field)</p>

<p>I wouldnt have macro’d on my main but he was the only one that was a member, and i didnt really see a way to get flax without being a member, or any kind of quick cash without being a member. I didnt really feel like spending another 5$ to get that acc banned either, but from now on i guess people should <em>ONLY</em> use scar on mains <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:">.

              <p>Ive never really posted in this forums just kinda read topics and such, today my main (level 77) (989 total) was banned! I also mis-entered my appeal by pressing enter.  :mad:  But i want to inform you guys that ive been auto’ing on my main for about 5 days now, and its pretty impressive that they caught me that fast. I was using Aryan /flax() script only too. Anyways, this is just a small warning, i think jagex is up to somthing cause someone on the forum got banned and 2 RL friends i know got banned today also. I think im going to quit runescape for a while, i think i might do the same thing as the other guy on here that got banned (Making lot of bots in free2play) Good luck to you all on scripting/macroing, this website helped me alot, especially the script tut’s and such, also a shout out to Mopar, NICE server Client and Aryan updater You PWN Jagex! You guys might find me on Uber server. <em>Auto’er 4 Life</em>  --Polaris</p>
<p>Still, i was making LOTS of cash, for the 5 days that i did auto i made 4.5m (Sold roughly 45000 flax)(About 9k flax a day)</p>
