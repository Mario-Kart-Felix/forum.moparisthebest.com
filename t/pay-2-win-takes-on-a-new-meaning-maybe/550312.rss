Why would they even think about this. I understand it&#39;s only a satisfaction survey, but obviously if they&#39;re polling the idea, they are considering adding it to game.</description>

You’re giving them too much credit. If there’s money to be made they’ll do it, they’re just getting their feet wet. Jagex isn’t making these decisions, it’s their investors which have the majority say since andrew left. They did similar shit to maplestory.</p>

<p>Still, I would not support any kind of “promotions” as those. The treasure hunter is already a money grinder… What else could they add?</p>
