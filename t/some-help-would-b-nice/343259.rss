    <title>SOme Help would b Nice</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-help-would-b-nice/343259</link>
    <description>hey i need some help (0bviously lol) :D
Okay anyways i wanted to add some stuff to my server to make it nice =] so this is what i need:
I was wondering if somebody has a tut on clan wars, so i can put to my server. I have a 317 server btw.
Also how to make npcs talk, and how to put custom items in my server. i looked at many tuts but whenever i spawn my item it looks like some guy took a shit..... Last thing is: i want a command which i find hard to make,
::allstafftome 
which would mean that all the staff members of my server would teleport to me, not any normal players.

Thank-you and i appreciate your time :D
P.s: I&#39;m a first time coder :D</description>
