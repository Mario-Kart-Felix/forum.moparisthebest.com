    <title>How to add working defense?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-working-defense/256838</link>
    <description>well my server is a very old source (jordiescape), and its pk only source for me...
At this source, def realy doesnt matters...
u cant, as example, wear guthan and be safe of melee atacks cuz it gaves the def, i know how to edit it
at item.cfg, but it doesnt realy protects you, as it supposed to do.
if anyone have a code or something to fix it, ill be glad to thank you, please help me, byes :D</description>
