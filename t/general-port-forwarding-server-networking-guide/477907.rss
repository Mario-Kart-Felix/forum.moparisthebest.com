    <title>General Port-Forwarding/Server Networking Guide</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/general-port-forwarding-server-networking-guide/477907</link>
    <description>I know there have been a few tutorials out for port-forwarding, but what makes this one different is the fact that it should cover any router type, old/new. And also, it gives more tips for a secure connection. This guide is made to help, and I&#39;m here to help as well, post a comment if you&#39;re having any trouble following this guide.

[size=12pt][i][u][b]Table of Contents[/b][/u][/i][/size]
[i]I. What is the main purpose of port-forwarding? 
II. How do I port-forward?
III. What do I do after port-forwarding?[/i]

There is also a good tutorial for port-forwarding put out by [b]sk8rdude461[/b], which uses a different method than this tutorial. You can check it out [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,590760.0.html]here[/url].

[size=14pt][u][b]I. What is the main purpose of port-forwarding?[/b][/u][/size]
As a connection comes in from elsewhere on the internet, your router reads what port it&#39;s using, and a few other pieces of information. Port-forwarding tells your router to send any incoming ports of.. (Specified by user) to be sent to your computer, so it can provide the services that are being requested. Generally, private servers use the port 43594, or sometimes 5555. It can be whatever you want, you just need to make sure you port-forward the port that your server is listening on.

[size=14pt][u][b]II. How do I port-forward?[/b][/u][/size]
[b]Step 1:[/b] [u]Log in to your routers settings..[/u]
- Open your favorite internet browser and in the URL bar type, &#39;192.168.1.1&#39; if that doesn&#39;t work, try either &#39;192.168.0.1&#39; or &#39;192.168.1.2&#39;. It should prompt you for a username and password, by default the username is usually &#39;admin&#39; and the password is also &#39;admin&#39;. If that doesn&#39;t work, try &#39;password&#39; for the password, as some routers have this as their default setting. If neither of those two combinations work, the predefined password is sometimes printed on your router somewhere, look around and see if you can find it. If not, try logging in with the username &#39;admin&#39; and the password as whatever your Wi-Fi password is (if you&#39;ve set one.) If none of these possibilities work, try talking to the owner of the router (possibly your parents.) I should probably add that if you live in an apartment, they probably wont let you port-forward, as it&#39;s a security problem.

[b]Step 2:[/b] [u]Navigation to port-forwarding menu..[/u]
- After you&#39;ve logged in to your router, look in the menu/navigation area, sometimes there is a link straight to port-forwarding. If not, look for an &#39;Advanced&#39; link, or &#39;Gaming and Applications&#39;. One of these variants should work, if not, try to find it listed under something else. You should be presented with a screen that has text boxes and drop down menus, or, sometimes radio buttons. If you&#39;re at this screen, proceed to the next step in this tutorial.

[b]Step 3:[/b] [u]Getting your IPv4 address, and finally, port-forwarding..[/u]
- Now, you&#39;ll need to go to Start &gt; Run and type in &#39;cmd&#39; (Windows XP). If you have Windows 7, type cmd in the search area provided in the start menu.  A black box/window should come up, this is command prompt, he is your friend. Type in &#39;ipconfig&#39; and find the listing that says &#39;IPv4 Address . . . &#39; to the right of that (same line) you should see a string of numbers and periods, something along the lines of, &#39;192.168.1.#&#39; the pound symbol being any number. It can be something else, but either way, take note of this, as you&#39;ll need it to port-forward. Next, go back to your browser and to your router settings window, type in the IPv4 Address where it asks for it (on some routers you&#39;ll need to click, &#39;Create custom application&#39;. For port type in whatever port your server is listening on (generally, 43594.) And select TCP, if it only gives the option for TCP/UDP, this is fine also. Then click &#39;save&#39; or &#39;edit&#39; or &#39;ok&#39; whatever the progression button may be. Now, most routers, you&#39;re done. However, go back to the router port-forwarding screen and sometimes you&#39;ll need to tick a small box by the entry you just added, to enable the port-forward.

-- This concludes section II --

[size=14pt][u][b]III. What do I do after port-forwarding?[/b][/u][/size]
Now that you&#39;re done, you&#39;ll want to change the IP Addresses in your client to whatever your EXTERNAL IP Address is, please note, this is not the same as your internal IP (IPv4). If you don&#39;t know your IP, simply go to http://whatsmyip.org/ and it&#39;ll let you know what your current IP Address is. I would also like to say, No-IP is not needed in setting up a server, at all, whoever started the thought that it&#39;s required, go burn. It&#39;s a third part application for taking your numeric IP address (such as 11.22.33.143) and assigning it a text representation (such as myserver.no-ip.org) which is un-needed people can connect to your numeric IP Address just fine. The thought of No-IP is that it will disguise your IP Address from &#39;hackers&#39;. However, this is useless, a hacker can easily log into your server, open command prompt, and type &#39;netstat -n&#39; and look for the IP associated with 43594 (your IP). Or, take your No-IP address and type &#39;ping yournoip.no-ip.org&#39; which will then display the true numeric IP of your server.

Thanks for checking out this tutorial, I may possibly be adding pictures later, let me know what you think. And remember, if you have ANY problems, or if this tutorial doesn&#39;t cover your router, comment below, or private message me. Thanks! - The Web Guy</description>

<p>Those are long and bulky, and give a lot of useless information. And sadly, some of the terminology on that site, people cannot understand. I’ve made this for the noobs who constantly post, 'omg, error connecting to server?!" in the server help section, as this is very simple, and easy to follow. Along with sk8rdude461’s tut.</p>

As a connection comes in from elsewhere on the internet, your router reads what port it’s using, and a few other pieces of information. Port-forwarding tells your router to send any incoming ports of… (Specified by user) to be sent to your computer, so it can provide the services that are being requested. Generally, private servers use the port 43594, or sometimes 5555. It can be whatever you want, you just need to make sure you port-forward the port that your server is listening on.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">II. How do I port-forward?</span></span>[/size]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Step 1:</span> <span class="bbcode-u">Log in to your routers settings…</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Open your favorite internet browser and in the URL bar type, ‘192.168.1.1’ if that doesn’t work, try either ‘192.168.0.1’ or ‘192.168.1.2’. It should prompt you for a username and password, by default the username is usually ‘admin’ and the password is also ‘admin’. If that doesn’t work, try ‘password’ for the password, as some routers have this as their default setting. If neither of those two combinations work, the predefined password is sometimes printed on your router somewhere, look around and see if you can find it. If not, try logging in with the username ‘admin’ and the password as whatever your Wi-Fi password is (if you’ve set one.) If none of these possibilities work, try talking to the owner of the router (possibly your parents.) I should probably add that if you live in an apartment, they probably wont let you port-forward, as it’s a security problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 2:</span> <span class="bbcode-u">Navigation to port-forwarding menu…</span></p>
<ul>
<li>After you’ve logged in to your router, look in the menu/navigation area, sometimes there is a link straight to port-forwarding. If not, look for an ‘Advanced’ link, or ‘Gaming and Applications’. One of these variants should work, if not, try to find it listed under something else. You should be presented with a screen that has text boxes and drop down menus, or, sometimes radio buttons. If you’re at this screen, proceed to the next step in this tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 3:</span> <span class="bbcode-u">Getting your IPv4 address, and finally, port-forwarding…</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, you’ll need to go to Start &gt; Run and type in ‘cmd’ (Windows XP). If you have Windows 7, type cmd in the search area provided in the start menu.  A black box/window should come up, this is command prompt, he is your friend. Type in ‘ipconfig’ and find the listing that says 'IPv4 Address . . . ’ to the right of that (same line) you should see a string of numbers and periods, something along the lines of, ‘192.168.1.#’ the pound symbol being any number. It can be something else, but either way, take note of this, as you’ll need it to port-forward. Next, go back to your browser and to your router settings window, type in the IPv4 Address where it asks for it (on some routers you’ll need to click, ‘Create custom application’. For port type in whatever port your server is listening on (generally, 43594.) And select TCP, if it only gives the option for TCP/UDP, this is fine also. Then click ‘save’ or ‘edit’ or ‘ok’ whatever the progression button may be. Now, most routers, you’re done. However, go back to the router port-forwarding screen and sometimes you’ll need to tick a small box by the entry you just added, to enable the port-forward.</li>
</ul>

<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">III. What do I do after port-forwarding?</span></span>[/size]<br>
Now that you’re done, you’ll want to change the IP Addresses in your client to whatever your EXTERNAL IP Address is, please note, this is not the same as your internal IP (IPv4). If you don’t know your IP, simply go to <a href="http://whatsmyip.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://whatsmyip.org/</a> and it’ll let you know what your current IP Address is. I would also like to say, No-IP is not needed in setting up a server, at all, whoever started the thought that it’s required, go burn. It’s a third part application for taking your numeric IP address (such as 11.22.33.143) and assigning it a text representation (such as <a href="http://myserver.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">myserver.no-ip.org</a>) which is un-needed people can connect to your numeric IP Address just fine. The thought of No-IP is that it will disguise your IP Address from ‘hackers’. However, this is useless, a hacker can easily log into your server, open command prompt, and type ‘netstat -n’ and look for the IP associated with 43594 (your IP). Or, take your No-IP address and type ‘ping <a href="http://yournoip.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">yournoip.no-ip.org</a>’ which will then display the true numeric IP of your server.</p>
