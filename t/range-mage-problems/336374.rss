well when someone create an acc... it will be added in the inventory 5k bronze arrows.. and when some one wield it and shot in some npc&#39;s, the arrows in the inventory will never lose...
example :
I have 5000 arrows in my bag, i shot 100 in npc&#39;s, but it stays in 5000 arrows... and theres another problem...
my members says that is annoying buying arrows and runes 1 each of the time... i wanted to put the &quot;X&quot; for them to buy whatever the number of runes and arrows they wanted... how do I fix that ?
