    <title>PI Dupe - No Tutorial Found For The Particular One!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-dupe-no-tutorial-found-for-the-particular-one/363827</link>
    <description>Well there is a dupe i found while fixing up my server today, it&#39;s a trading dupe for Project Insanity, there isn&#39;t a tutorial for this trading dupe that I could find. Here is how the dupe is being processed.

Take 1 Noted Item, any Noted Item.
Next trade a player.
Put the item into trade.
Now right click the item your have in trade, and select, &quot;Remove X&quot;.
Then type in, &quot;1&quot;.
Now Hit enter.
This places 1 of that item in your inventory and still leaves the other noted item in the trade, giving you 2 items, and you can continue doing this. 
If there is a tutorial for fixing this in particular, sorry for posting this, but please help me out. The only for for fixing a trade dupe i could find was one that including using a store in the dupe. If there isn&#39;t a tutorial, please help me out, this is very important.

-Thank you for your time.</description>
