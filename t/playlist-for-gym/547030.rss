    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/playlist-for-gym/547030</link>
    <description>So i downloaded a time ago a playlist from youtube so i can listen to while at the gym from youtube:

[youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B789lus-JE[/youtube]

But after few weeks , it&#39;s not as good as it was before and i&#39;m tired of hearing it all over and over.. 
So do you have any 1 - 2 Hours of electronic music or pump up music suggestions that you have heard?

I&#39;d appreciate it!
