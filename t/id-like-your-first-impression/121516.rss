    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/id-like-your-first-impression/121516</link>
    <description>I&#39;m doing a small survey, and since this forum has visitors from many countries and places, I thought it would be ideal to post it here.

If you are willing, [b]I would be curious to know your first impressions about the people in the images below.[/b]
I don&#39;t need any long explanations or anything, but would just like to know what you would initially think of you saw either of them walking down the street or something.

I was offended by your post because I believe in freedom of speech. I think it is stupid to not say your opinion (one must of course justify it well) because you feel that it <span class="bbcode-i">might</span> offend someone. However, just shouting random things like “NUKE SWEDEN!” is obviously not appropriate. In my opinion we have to able to openly discuss anything. This includes drugs, the law, terrorism … you name it.</p>

With regards to that, they aren’t the first group to be labeled as bad. They certainly won’t be the last either.</p>
<p>If you are interested in history, then you will be aware of what happened with communism. Everyone hated the Russians and the Chinese, much like a lot of people hate muslims now. That hate is usually an outward manifestation of fear felt by a person (much like you will see a person’s eyes move to the right when they try to recall something, or upwards when they are thinking). That fear, for most people, is indeed media induced.</p>

              <p>To be honest lothy, say if it was the Australians instead of the Muslims?<br>
Say it was a way of culture in australia for some people, but not for the whole of australia, i mean just like in iraq, Pakistan and other surrounding country’s a very small amount believe in the culture of doing what the suicide bombers do.</p>
<p>But yeah imagine it was the Australians doing that, but you are completely innocent and don’t follow this culture of the suicide bombers, but as you are Australian you get stereotyped for being a suicide bomber, you would hate that.</p>
<p>But if you want to think that way about Muslims/other religions then do so, but keep it to yourself because honestly i imagine a huge majority of Muslims are going through a whole lot of crap other this because of the real offenders.</p>
<p>I know here in england, a shop near me run by a muslim couple constantly got abuse thrown at them, things like “go back to your own country terrorists” things like that, eventually the shop (they also lived above the shop) got petrol bombed.</p>
<p>So like i said, you wouldn’t like it if you was being labeled as something because of something, say another Australian done.</p>

And i dont think he says “Rubbish” stuff.<br>
“Why do Sikhs wear turbans?” did not say why do they wear them i said when they can take it off<br>
and if this thread will be all racism and will make bigger problem then…AM OUT…</p>
<p>What about People getting impression if someone says “Muslim” then you think of terrorism?<br>
and Bob am sorry if that was offensive to you…I really say it again i respect any religion .[/quote]</p>
<p>Well then, as I said in my other post, the turban is a part of our dress.  We wear it all the time in public (whether we wear the full turban or a “mini” one), and only really keep it off at home and when sleeping.  Sikhism teaches respect of all religions - we are taught of the equality of all people regardless of religion, race, sex, etc…</p>
<p>Any kind of violence between Sikhs and Muslims (which does exist in places like London, I believe) reflects the people, not the religion.  Just like you cannot attribute the actions of terrorists such as Al-Quaeda to the teachings of Islam.</p>
<p>Again, I don’t know where you’re getting that about Sikhs taking off their turbans only when they kill a Muslim.  And again, I invite you to find me some information about it.  But I have told you what I know…and I am quite confident that what I know is what Sikhism actually teaches.  I took offense to that one statement of yours, but if I can correct your belief I will be more than appeased.</p>

But let’s say you did go to buy one. You pick one up, and go to the checkout. You don’t know whether it’s good or not unless you open the box and test it.</p>
<p>I act the same way towards muslims at times (and people that look like muslims). At the end of the day, I’m the sort of person that would rather be alive, instead of taking the risk and trusting someone who is potentially a ‘bad product’.</p>
<p>As for it being a ‘racist’ thing to do… Well, try telling that to the families of the victims of the Bali bombings, or the bombings in England.</p>

<p>Before I say anything else at all to you, I would like you to find any kind of mention of that on the internet…anywhere.  Making such a comment, in my view, requires some kind of basis.</p>
<p>There’s no need to remove your posts, but I still do find it offensive for it is entirely untrue, primarily because I am Sikh.  I have grown up as a Sikh, learning the teachings, and I have never heard of such a thing.  The turban and uncut hair maintain our identity.  Seriously, 99% of the people in the US who keep that appearance are Sikh and not Muslim.  The turban was introduced for two reasons: it keeps our hair tidy and clean, and it disregards the cast system that existed in India during Sikhism’s founding.  Besides that, it is obvious to say that wearing a turban makes you stand out.  Thus, it is a constant reminder to abide by the teachings of Sikhi and to follow the rules of society, for one’s actions represent not only yourself but the entire Sikh community.</p>
<p>Honestly, in the US where there are such few Sikhs to begin with, the impression you leave on people is quite important for that determines how they will view all other Sikhs in the future.  For that reason alone, I find that extremely offensive.  And I invite you to show me evidence contrary to what I have said, and to back up your claim.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support, Fr33sc4p3, and thank you for that link.  But I must correct you in one sense: Sikhism is a relatively new religion, founded in 1463 (if i remember correctly).  Our identify (including the turban) was given to us on April 13th, 1699.  Islam began in the 7th century, I believe, so it is far older.  However, whereas a turban is a part of a Sikh’s dress, turbans are worn by an extremely small percentage of Muslims, and is primarily used to indicate wealth, power, or class.</p>

Sikhs have been around much longer than Muslims considering the Muslim religion is one of the newest, they had the turban before the Muslim religion even existed.</p>

<p>Completely understandable that you would find such generalizations offensive…I mean out of 1.2 billion Muslims in the world, its amazingly closed-minded to assume that all Muslims are terrorists.</p>
<p>But I have to ask you, what in the world do you mean by: “i just want to say about the Two indians above there that they are from the sieck religion and they are minding them selves …although and i am saying this because am sure of they WIll never take the thing off they’re head untill they kill a MUSLIM.”</p>
<p>If I interpret it correctly, I find that one comment <span class="bbcode-b">hugely</span> offensive…<br>
[/quote]<br>
am sorry if it was offensive to any one here but i just wanted to tell you that because it’s a “fact” and if you ask them they will say what i have just said and if it was an offensive then all religions are offensive to others?? am just telling what they really say and i <span class="bbcode-b">Respect </span> they religion ot any other religions.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re saying that if you speak to any Sikh, what they will tell you is that their desire is to kill a Muslim?  Can you please explain that you mean, and what kind of ground you have to make such a statement?  I don’t mean to be attacking you at all, I just wish to know…</p>

Well thank you for your responses so far…granted, some of them were not exactly what I was looking for but it helps nonetheless <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  I will see if I can keep this topic going just a tad longer and ask you all:</p>
<p>[b]If you had to guess, what would you say the nationalities (ie. country of origin) are of these two men?[/b}</p>
<p>Also, some of you seem to be mixing up your rights and lefts so lets go for white beard/black beard this time <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
[/quote]<br>
I’d say that the guy with the black beard is from either Iraq or Israel. The white bearded guy is probably from a similar region.[/quote]</p>
<p>And i thought you was smart <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
