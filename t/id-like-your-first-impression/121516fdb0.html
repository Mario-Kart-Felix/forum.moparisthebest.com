Say it was a way of culture in australia for some people, but not for the whole of australia, i mean just like in iraq, Pakistan and other surrounding country’s a very small amount believe in the culture of doing what the suicide bombers do.</p>
<p>But yeah imagine it was the Australians doing that, but you are completely innocent and don’t follow this culture of the suicide bombers, but as you are Australian you get stereotyped for being a suicide bomber, you would hate that.</p>
<p>But if you want to think that way about Muslims/other religions then do so, but keep it to yourself because honestly i imagine a huge majority of Muslims are going through a whole lot of crap other this because of the real offenders.</p>
<p>I know here in england, a shop near me run by a muslim couple constantly got abuse thrown at them, things like “go back to your own country terrorists” things like that, eventually the shop (they also lived above the shop) got petrol bombed.</p>
<p>So like i said, you wouldn’t like it if you was being labeled as something because of something, say another Australian done.</p>
<p>(Sorry for my bad wording i was typing fast and not thinking much about it lol)</p>

Well You are again saying you act towards “Muslims”  … why only “muslims”?<br>
not other religions? am just wondering?..<br>
[/quote]<br>
Because Muslims have been automatically labeled as terrorists after 9/11, of course.  This was another reason for posting this thread…its obvious that people still believe Sikhs to be Muslims.  We have the same kinds of issues that you guys have…not to mention that we stand out a tad more as well.[/quote]<br>
With regards to that, they aren’t the first group to be labeled as bad. They certainly won’t be the last either.</p>
<p>If you are interested in history, then you will be aware of what happened with communism. Everyone hated the Russians and the Chinese, much like a lot of people hate muslims now. That hate is usually an outward manifestation of fear felt by a person (much like you will see a person’s eyes move to the right when they try to recall something, or upwards when they are thinking). That fear, for most people, is indeed media induced.</p>

        <p>Oh, absolutely, I was just talking to Fr33sc4p3 about this actually.  Even during WWII, the Japanese living in America were persecuted and were placed into camps.  But one would imagine that with such widespread media and news access, it might have been possible to get people to abandon their stereotypes.  But they do seem to make it worse.  I mean, from this thread alone it is clear that people still maintain stereotypical beliefs.</p>
<p>But lothy, for stating yourself that its all media induced, you don’t seem to have much faith in your own words judging on your previous post…I mean, if the fear has been unfairly and unnecessarily spread, why do you feel it?</p>

        <p>The people who are posting “Ahhh terrorist run!!!” is inappropriate and racist. It is their culture and they deserve just as much respect as you all do.</p>
<p>Think of if that was you, and you knew people were talking about how you looked and dressed. I am certain that there are Muslims that do join these forums, what do you think they would say if you said something rude? If you guessed them feeling bad and flaming you possibly, you are correct.</p>

I was offended by your post because I believe in freedom of speech. I think it is stupid to not say your opinion (one must of course justify it well) because you feel that it <span class="bbcode-i">might</span> offend someone. However, just shouting random things like “NUKE SWEDEN!” is obviously not appropriate. In my opinion we have to able to openly discuss anything. This includes drugs, the law, terrorism … you name it.</p>
