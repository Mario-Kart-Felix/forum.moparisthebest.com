choice5(&quot;@or3@You currently have &quot;+pkpoints+&quot; PVPP.&quot;,&quot;I want to buy 1m!  (52)&quot;,&quot;I want to have the right to hold the Godswords! (2500)&quot;,&quot;I want to have the right to hold dragon claws! (7000)&quot;,&quot;Next page.&quot;);
				break;
			case 1338:
choice5(&quot;@or3@You currently have &quot;+pkpoints+&quot; PVPP.&quot;,&quot;I want to have the right to hold black claws!(coming soon) (4500)&quot;,&quot;I want to have the right to hold a leaf-bladed spear! (6000)&quot;,&quot;I want to have the right to hold a cutlass! (39500)&quot;,&quot;I want to buy bandos. (20000)&quot;);
