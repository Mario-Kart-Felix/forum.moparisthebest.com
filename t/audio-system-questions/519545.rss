    <title>Audio System Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/audio-system-questions/519545</link>
    <description> I have a general question about connecting my two sets of speakers.

I have a four speaker setup in my room, just a standard kind of mediocre JVC system with outputs that looks like this:

So basically it&#39;s a stereo with four speakers, connected by speaker wire (it took me several years of research to figure this out, FYI). Now I like the way it sounds in general, but it could use a bit more thumpy and solid bass and needs a crisper high end as well. I have some computer speakers, these ones to be exact:
http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-980-000382-Z313-Speaker-System/dp/B002HWRZ2K

Basically I want to connect these two systems, so the sub will work with my stereo and the two little speakers can be up on the sides of the room for surround. I don&#39;t know if this is possible since the stereo doesn&#39;t appear to have a headphone output and it only has the output for speakers. Is this an easy thing to do with a little soldering or is it a crazy idea that&#39;s not worth it? Can I connect a regular stereo to computer speakers so it makes a functioning setup, even if the stereo only has speaker wire outputs?

Thank you for your time!</description>
