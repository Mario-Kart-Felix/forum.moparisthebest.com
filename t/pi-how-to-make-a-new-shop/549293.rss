    <title>[PI] How to make a new shop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-how-to-make-a-new-shop/549293</link>
    <description>Hello here is another easy tutorial that I think many new RS developers get stuck on. Ok so in this tutorial I will be showing you how to make a brand new shop in 3 easy steps

Files that will be edited:
shops.cfg
Actionhandler.java
spawn-config.cfg

Ok so lets start by opening up your shops.cfg this is located in:
Data &gt; cfg

Now we have opened up this file you will see all your shops. 
[code=java]shop = 94	Dicing_Store	2	2	####	####[/code]	

Ok so we need to add a new one of these so scroll to the bottom of the file (you don&#39;t have to put it at the bottom) and then add a new line of this following code:
[code=java][code=java]shop = ####	####	2	2	####	####[/code][/code]

Explanation:
[code=java]shop = ####[/code]
This is your shops primary key for the shop this cannot be the same as any other shop in your shops.cfg for example if you have a shop called shop = 1 and you make another called shop = 1 it will not work.

[code=java]####[/code]
This is what your shop will be called when you open it. this will be shown in your shop interface along the top this could be anything you would like it to be.

[code=java]####	####[/code]
These are for the item and the amount of that item that will be put in the store.

#### = Item id #### = Amount of the item in the shop

/*NOTE*\
In creating more items in the shop you cannot use your regular &quot;space bar&quot; on your keyboard you will need to use the &quot;tab&quot; button on some and most keyboards it will look this |&lt;-----
                                                                      -----&gt;|
Example:
[code=java]shop = 94	Dicing_Store	2	2	15084	1000	2996	1000	5608	1000	5156	1000	5157	1000	5158	1000	5159	1000[/code]

Save and we are done with shops.cfg

Now open up your Actionhandler.java you can find this file by searchign for it or going to the directory 
src &gt; server &gt; model &gt; players

Now we are in your actionhandler class file search for:
[code=java]switch(npcType) {[/code]

Under that add:
[code=java]		case ####:
			c.getShops().openShop(####);
			break;[/code]

Explanation:
[code=java]case ####[/code]
This is the npc id. change the #### to the npc that you would like to use as your shop keeper.

[code=java]c.getShops().openShop(####);[/code]
This is the shops primary key that we created earlier. Change #### to the shop id you used.

Example:
		[code=java]case 756:
			c.getShops().openShop(94);
			break;[/code]

Now we have to put the NPC into your game/world

open spawn-config.cfg this can be located at &quot;Data &gt; cfg&quot;

Ok now we are in spawn-config.cfg you will see lots of npcs. Ok so we need to create are own line add:
[code=java]spawn = ####	####	####	####	0	0	0	0	####[/code]

Explanation:
[code=java][code=java]spawn = ####[/code]
This is the NPC that will spawn in-game you will need to change the #### to the NPC that you used in Actionhandler.java.

[code=java]####	####	####[/code]
These are to coords where your npc will spawn ingame.
#### = X coord #### = Y Coord #### = height.
 
[code=java]####[/code]
this is the description of your NPC it doesn&#39;t have to be anything good as it just is easier for you to find it. This will not show up in-game.

Example:
[code=java]spawn = 765	3333	3333	0	0	0	0	0	l3l_new_shop[/code]

Save and compile and we are done.
