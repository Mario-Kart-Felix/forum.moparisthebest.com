    <title>718 Server development</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-server-development/548424</link>
    <description>Hello. I&#39;m Cerulean and I&#39;m currently attempting to start a v718 RSPS. It seems that with my lack of experience and skills in Java, I&#39;m a bit lost with some of the server. I&#39;m looking for a developer/coder to help me with most of the Java related aspects of the server. I&#39;m willing to pay, and we can work on the pay as we go along. I&#39;m willing to agree on a fair price depending on your experience and skills, and what you can help me do. You can reply to this post, message me, or add me on skype.

Thank you!</description>
