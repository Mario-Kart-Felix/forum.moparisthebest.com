    <title>Anyone interested in flying some internet spaceships?</title>

    <description>I recently started playing Eve again... anyone wanna join me?

PM or post here if you want a 21day invite (the one on the site is 14 days). If you subscribe from my invite I get free playtime, so I will send anyone who uses my invite ingame money to get them started as a thankyou.

Hit me up ingame if you need any help with anything at all.

Common Misconceptions (Inspired by eXemplar)
* [i]Wahhh Eve is really boring.[/i] - Don&#39;t be misled by the tutorial. To combat Eve&#39;s reputation for being too hard, they made the tutorial really easy (and boring as fuck). If it bores you that much, just don&#39;t do it all. The basics are worth doing for knowledge, and the rest is definitely worth doing for the free stuff you get (even ships), but if you&#39;re really bored, just leave it.
* [i]Wahhh Eve is really hard.[/i] - Nah, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s a deep and complex game, but if you don&#39;t give a fuck about weapon falloff and transversal velocities and whatnot you can get along just fine without giving a fuck.
* [i]Wahhh it will be ages before I can do anything.[/i] - Untrue. Because of the realtime skill system, it is true of course that you will never catch up in pure SP with the old timers, unless they quit. But you don&#39;t have to. Eve&#39;s skill system works kind of like RS&#39;s, without combat levels. That is to say, there is a bunch of little skills you train, and no &quot;main level&quot; restriction. If you want some pvp, we could get a couple people in a basic rifter fit in like 2 days and go do some pirate action or w/e. It actaully takes LESS time to do fun stuff than other MMOs.

Persuade persuade bother bother. I wanna fly with some of my MITB niggaz.</description>
