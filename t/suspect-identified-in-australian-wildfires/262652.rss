    <title>Suspect Identified in Australian Wildfires</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suspect-identified-in-australian-wildfires/262652</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;MELBOURNE, Australia (Feb. 16) - The only person so far accused of lighting one of Australia&#39;s deadly wildfires was named publicly Monday as officials urged a nation outraged by the alleged arson to let justice take its course.
Brendan Sokaluk, a 39-year-old who reportedly once served as a volunteer fighter, has been kept at a secret location by police since his arrest last week in connection to blazes that swept Victoria state because of fears for his safety.

The confirmed death toll from the Feb. 7 disaster crept to 189, and would rise further, police said.
Brendan Sokaluk&#39;s case went before a court packed with media and onlookers Monday, but he chose to stay in police protective custody rather than attend.
He was detained Friday and charged with one count of arson causing death and one of lighting a blaze now known as the Churchill fire. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years on the first charge, and 15 years on the second. He was also charged with possessing child pornography, which carries a 5-year maximum sentence.
Extremely hot, dry and windy conditions fanned dozens of fires into raging infernos that reduced entire towns to ashes, destroying more than 1,800 homes and displacing 7,500 people.
Raising the official death tally for the first time in four days, police Deputy Commissioner Kieran Walshe said the process of confirming victims had slowed because some remains were too damaged to identify them as human.
Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon said it was possible some victims would never be identified because &quot;perhaps you don&#39;t find very much of that person.&quot;
Detailing a previously announced, high-level inquiry in to the disaster, Victorian Premier John Brumby said it would have the broadest terms possible, examining all aspects of the fires&#39; causes and the preparedness of emergency services to respond. An initial report is due Aug. 17.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
