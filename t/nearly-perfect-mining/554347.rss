    <title>Nearly perfect mining!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nearly-perfect-mining/554347</link>
    <description>Alright, I just figured I would show off my latest update to mining, and I&#39;ll probably release this within the next week or so because I think I&#39;m finished with private servers in general. This may or may not have been done before, but every tutorial on mining I searched through made me sad because they were no where near runescapes mining. 


This was wrote to a Dawntained source, but can easily be converted to any source with a bit of editing.


[b]This mining features:[/b]
Every rock in runescape works, including newest I&#39;ds
Every rock has its correct grey rock id (besides rune apperently, i&#39;m fixing that now though lol)
A random chance to get a gem while mining any rock
Gem rocks give you gems
Tells you when you are mining a rock, what ore you obtained from the rock, and if you got a gem!

ignore the random number on the video, I was debugging something!

I misspelled feel, not sure how I managed that. Probably because I was rushing lol.

<p>Last thing: If the timers for the rocks to come back are like-runescape, everyone is going to hate it (Unless the server is explicitly a remake). The point of playing a RSPS is to get away from the grind of runescape. If I want to wait 15 minutes for 1 rune rock to respawn I’ll just go on RS.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>If you watched the video, you can see that the timers aren’t the same as runescapes. Of course I wouldn’t personally make anyone wait 22 minutes for a rune rock. Also, this isn’t for any specific server, I’m not hosting one, ill be releasing the code shortly (most likely) and people can set it up for their server any way they would like lol.[/quote]<br>
I watched bits of the video, didn’t stick through it all (Why? it’s mining, no need to watch you mine every rock lol)</p>
<p>As for releasing the code, I hope you aren’t using a bunch of arrays for this.</p>

I doubt this is as perfect as you think it is.</p>
<p>For instance:<br>
What’s stopping me from using Rune Agent to just tell the server I clicked a rock that was didn’t exist?<br>
What happens if a player teleports during mining?<br>
What happens if they spam click a rock?<br>
What happens if they click multiple rocks within the same vicinity (there are area’s on the map where 2 rocks are close to 1 tile)</p>
<p>But good job on achieving this, I guess. I know it’s an accomplishment for a beginner, and I’m not trying to sound like “omg you’re not good”. Just, I highly doubt it’s perfect.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Teleporting stops mining, you can’t spam click rocks, clicking another rock while mining resets all fields to give you the correct variables, not sure about Rune Agent, though <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>About Rune Agent, though. If you are willing to go through the trouble to use Rune Agent to mine a rock that isn’t there (and if it works), I’m gonna say go for it. The only thing you will be bypassing is the grayed out rock i guess?[/quote]<br>
If you use Rune Agent (this would just be one possibility), you could rig it to mine the same exact rock over and over and over, by simply just telling the server you clicked an active one, even if there is a dead one in it’s place (Or none at all).<br>
This happens mostly due to the fact that most people don’t load the cache (At minimal, map data) in their server (As seen in 600+ revision servers). Because no one loads the map data, there’s nothing to use as a reference for what does, and doesn’t, exist. So by default, the server assumes any object clicked is a valid object - which 99% of the time is true. The other 1% is people using rune agent and cheat engine.</p>
<p>On one server I tested Rune Agent on (Owner gave me permission), I was able to mine rocks from anywhere on the map, and also bank them. That was literally infinite mining without stopping.</p>
<p>Last thing: If the timers for the rocks to come back are like-runescape, everyone is going to hate it (Unless the server is explicitly a remake). The point of playing a RSPS is to get away from the grind of runescape. If I want to wait 15 minutes for 1 rune rock to respawn I’ll just go on RS.</p>
