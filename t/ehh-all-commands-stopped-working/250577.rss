    <title>Ehh.. All commands stopped working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ehh-all-commands-stopped-working/250577</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been doing some editing today, and everything was fine. But recently, my commands and action buttons stopped working. No teleport or pickup commands work, and nor do their respective action buttons. 

I find it strange, because upon compiling, I get not one error. If anyone can tell me why it&#39;s doing this, I&#39;d appreciate it.

Reapage source, btw.</description>
