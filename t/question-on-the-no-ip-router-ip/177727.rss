    <title>Question on the no-ip router ip</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-on-the-no-ip-router-ip/177727</link>
    <description>Yes I know there is a a tutorial on how to make a server on the tutorial section but I have a problem that no one will answer on there. Since mostly it is people that are still making servers and no one that actually knows how to make a server, I&#39;m asking it here. This is my problem: 

  On another thread, a guy said that the no-ip router ip should be your default gateway but for some reason, the router/proxy/NAT ip always changes to a different one. I have linksys if that makes a difference. I want to change it to my default gate way and I tried to change the ip on the modify add/remove host page but it keeps changes back to the other ip. :\ help?</description>
