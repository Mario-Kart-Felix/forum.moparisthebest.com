    <title>Somthings wrong with advertisement place?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/somthings-wrong-with-advertisement-place/262206</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, im kinda new to forums.

I went to the status advertisement page thing.  And i went to the bottum and registered my server.

And it said it would put it on there if it passed....and i noticed that someone that i dont know signed on my server so im guessing that was the guy that passes my server.  And then i read at the bottum that the page updates so i waited for that, and it still wasnt there :(   Any clue why? its 508 btw.....that isnt against the rules is it?</description>
