<p>bombing countries with different values simply isn’t enough, now you want to fine the parents in these countries for raising fat kids! (hint: look at the text on the mcdonalds sign)</p>
<p>go and read mitbs post, obesity isn’t the only health risk children face</p>
<p>ps its not about shooting down the idea of you wanting kids to be healthy, its about you wanting to fucking fine the parents for something which can very much be out of their control</p>
<p>pps also, care to explain your first post? "They can’t punish the ones who know how to portion control, god damn. Its the parent’s problems. " which ones are being punished? it doesn’t make sense if you think the parents, or the school are being punished</p>
<p>final ppps babies born to overweight/obese mothers tend to have health problems later on in life, smoking and drinking while pregnant can cause harm to the baby, but fuck abortions right, who needs them?</p>

<p>If someone is too dumb to learn that eating so much that they become obese by the time they are 15, they are never going to be of any functional use to society and they deserve to eat themselves to death.</p>
<p>Don’t make laws banning food, ban advertisement. Put more stringent laws into action surrounding social welfare so fat jobless fucks will at least get off their arse and work for their food. It’s your life, do what you want. 12 years of over-eating wont damage you substantially, brainwashing will.</p>

<p>Thanks mom! (goes to run into the other room unaware that the eating habits his mother is teaching him could kill him)</p>
<p>Im guessing you’re for abortion too, aren’t you?</p>
<p>Also by fat I mean obese[/quote]Like I said, you don’t understand the principles of how this country should work, but you will argue for the country.  I keep having to say the same things and you’re not understanding, so…</p>
<p>Perhaps you can tell the people who put fluoride in our water and aspartame and HFCS in our foods that they can’t do it because then parents will have a harder time “doing their job”.  Kids aren’t supposed to be skinny anyways.  They need some fat to grow into.  Most of the time a person is overweight because of a medical/psychological condition anyways.</p>

<p>perfect example.</p>
<p>To let a child who doesn’t know any better practically start killing himself with horrible eating habits has to be child endangerment.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why do you assume that if a person is fat they eat too much?  They could also have some sort of disorder or disease, and not everyone is made to weigh the same, what is your definition of ‘fat’?</p>
<p>So you want a law about how fat a parent can allow their child to get, because it could endanger their health?  What about a law about how long a child can watch TV? or play video games? or be on the internet? or how long they can exercise?  how about how much sleep they get?  Just about everything can be dangerous to your health if you do too much or too little of it.  The danger here is when you can’t just legislate one and forget about the others, and they should all remain choices for the individual to make.</p>

<p>It doesnt matter, the child doesn’t know how dangerous being overweight can be, and if the parent is not helping that child it could cost the child their life. This does not make me a jackass.</p>

<p>No, fining their parents. Depending on how much they are overweight they should pay a $100-500 fine a year.</p>

<p>over the pond cigarettes are taxed through the roof, shops make very little money from selling them(5-7% profit compared to 20-40% on groceries), you’re not allowed to smoke them in bars/hotels/restaurants/public indoor places and the term used for cigarettes is fag[/quote]</p>
<p>Just to note, here cigarettes are taxed heavily as well, and in many states including Ohio where I live, you aren’t allowed to smoke in any restaurants, bars, or any other public areas either.</p>
<p>However, smoking is different than eating ‘unhealthy’ foods, since smoking near others forces them to inhale dangerous second hand smoke, where as what you eat doesn’t affect anyone else.  If someone wants to eat themselves to death that is their choice, no one else has the right to choose for them.</p>
