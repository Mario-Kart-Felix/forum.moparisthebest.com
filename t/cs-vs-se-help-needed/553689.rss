    <title>CS vs SE , help needed?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cs-vs-se-help-needed/553689</link>
    <description>Like what is the difference between both? I read that SE is obviously specialized in writing software , programs , and such. But i don&#39;t really understand what a CS major exactly do? 
I researched a bit , but no one has a straight answer , all i could conclude is that you do a bit of everything? I don&#39;t get it.

And also which do you think is better to choose? or can i go with both? I really have no idea what to expect out of either.

Help from your experience would be nice. Thanks.</description>

              <p>What the Biebs said pretty much summarizes the differences. This differs by institution, but in my experience you learn more mathematics than someone in SE does due to the nature of studying algorithms and data structures rigorously. When it comes to finding jobs, they are considered pretty much the same job. The only difference becomes apparent if you have a master’s or PhD where you might be working more specifically on CS vs. SE topics for research. In my own experience, all my professional jobs have been as a software engineer, even though I’m in CS. Same job.</p>

              <p>It varies a lot between institutions but in general there’s a lot of overlap between the two. Computer science focuses more on algorithms, data structures, and some lower level stuff like C and computer architecture. Software engineering also involves programming, but is more focused on things like development methodologies, architecture and design. So an advantage to taking SE is that you’ll be more prepared for the workplace in general, but will be lacking knowledge about more technical stuff. If you took CS you’d have a better understanding of how computers work and be able to write more specialised software, but might not be aware of the importance of TDD and mess up a big project.</p>
