    <description>Anyone have ANY clue at all how to by-pass the SEP blocking? I&#39;ve tried several different things. I have access to pretty much nothing.. if that makes any difference at all. I&#39;ve tried making a cp.bat with notepad and getting CP to Ping a websites IP, tried entering the IP into the address bar. Still does nothing.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>According to yahoo answers</p>
<blockquote>The ECOT computer has programming that does not allow you to explore the web. That is one of the things about ECOT - sites are limited. ECOT does remote formatting of the computers to update software and fix problems. Any time you shut off the computer, it will revert back to saved programs. 
<p>If you want to explore the internet, go to the library or find a different computer. If ECOT detects that you have changed the computer, they can ask you to return it. You are tampering with school property.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could try sticking in an Ubuntu live CD, if you’re lucky, they won’t have a BIOS password/set CD to first boot device.</p>
