    <title>A thought of mine</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-thought-of-mine/108934</link>
    <description>Well we all know here at moparisthebest.com know how annoying those damn noobs can be who post &quot;HEW DO I DO TEH MOPARSCAPES HAX?&quot; well what punishment do they get? usually lately ive seen nothing, their posts are locked and they are told to go to moparisthebest.com.

I was thinking perhaps we should have a proper punishment for this, such as a &quot;stupid crown&quot; which they have to wear for ages, like the &quot;Warned&quot; or &quot;muted&quot; signs people get.

I dont know... just a suggestion.. what else can we do to stop the noobs from posting? i&#39;ve tryed being nice and i dont know how long i can keep it up, but yeah..... lol.</description>

Well sure they can sort it out, but there isn’t a problem with us suggesting stuff.[quote=“1337h4x, post:16, topic:108934”]and make the “Click here if you are interested in RuneScape Private Servers” redirect to wowomg[/quote]<br>
Best idea ever.</p>

I suggest we make this the first time you enter the site MITB you won’t enter the site but you will get a choice , something like this :</p>
<hr>
<h2>If you are interested in Java programming…click here | If you are interested in Runescape pv-servers…click here<br>
|</h2>
<p>First option will redirect you to MITB and second option to Moparscape obviously.<br>
This way i’m pretty sure less or no people will come on MITB and ask questions about Moparscape.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>More like:</p>
<p><a href="http://moparisthebest.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Click here if you are interested in RuneScape Cheating</a> | <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Click here if you are interested in RuneScape Private Servers</a>[/quote]<br>
yea whatever its just the idea im talking about not about how its going to look like.<br>
And by the way its better to cut away the “Runescape cheating” part cause this will atract noobs too.<br>
anyway it’s not a bad idea is it?</p>

I’ve been trying my best to do that for 5 months, it hasn’t payed off.  Eventually, it got really bad and the spam just kept mounting up.  I think everyone’s just given up on it.</p>
<p>Anyway, on-topic, I agree with Bob.  We shouldn’t be mean to people.  Simply telling them to go to MoparScape is a better idea.  Not branding them for a simple mistake.</p>

              <p>Fair enough… but i really do think a warning should be given for any post like that, i mean i got warned for posting a silly picture (Sure i should have known better) but so should have the noob.</p>
<p>A warning… along with a PM explaing about it will be liften in 7 days, and the reason why, and the right site to go to (e.g. <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a>)</p>
<p>I mean its better then just letting them get off scot free? And how in the world did they pass the test to get in here?</p>

              <p>I’ve only given moderations if people continue to ask on these forums once we have redirected them.  Typically, the people who are asking are new members who can’t be bothered to read anything (unfortunately).  But we even have to remind some of the better members of the rules…people turn out different, and I’m sure that although 90%+ of those members will simply leech and not contribute a thing, some will turn out to be fairly active and helpful members of the community.</p>
<p>Thus, I don’t really agree with that kind of degrading message…maybe we could start doing warnings (dunno yet though), but I don’t agree with a stupid crown.</p>

              <p>Well we all know here at <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> know how annoying those damn noobs can be who post “HEW DO I DO TEH MOPARSCAPES HAX?” well what punishment do they get? usually lately ive seen nothing, their posts are locked and they are told to go to <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>.</p>
<p>I was thinking perhaps we should have a proper punishment for this, such as a “stupid crown” which they have to wear for ages, like the “Warned” or “muted” signs people get.</p>
<p>I dont know… just a suggestion… what else can we do to stop the noobs from posting? i’ve tryed being nice and i dont know how long i can keep it up, but yeah… lol.</p>
