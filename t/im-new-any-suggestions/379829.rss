    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-new-any-suggestions/379829</link>
    <description>so, here i am. a newb to RSPS&#39;s. not a newb to Java.
well, i&#39;m here to learn more about Java and RSPS&#39;s, and i already learned a lot the last few days. now i want to seriously start editing a base server and creating some cool stuff, but i get stuck. i&#39;ve already downloaded like 10-20 servers and bases, but i still can&#39;t decide. some of them don&#39;t have any .java files (only .class) and some don&#39;t have a client. another one&#39;s compiler gives an error.

now i want to know, what would be best to do? what version? i used to mess around with 317, but what would be best, and for what one would i find most usefull tutorials?
and which server would you recommend me? easy to edit, a lot to change, easy to add your own stuff, and it must also have some tutorials for it. i liked the deltascape source alot, because there are a lot of deltascape and 317 tutorials around, the only problem is, i would like to have it HD (or at least skillcape emotes) and i want them to have as much stuff as the mdoern RS has got now. so, would it be better to go to 508 or 614 or something?


i hope someone can help me out and give me a suggesion what source i could download best. :)</description>

<p>Your server sends the “packets” over, so it tells your client to play graphics, set the animation for a weapon, etc.</p>
<p>I’m not the best guy to explain this, you might want to head over to client help and ask over there.</p>

yh, i decided to try out hyperion, and if yo had read some of the posts in the thread, oyu might see my questions about coding for hyperion. if you could aswer some of these, thst would be helpful <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

You can check the packets sent on the sticky in the server help section[/quote]so, then, will the methods of 317 resembl 508’s?<br>
and i still don’t get when you have to add soething to your client. i ave programmed online games before, and i know a lot bout serversided and clientsided stuff, but in RSPSs it seems like you barely even do something to your client files. almost erything is done serversided and in the server’s client.java</p>

<p>great idea. just like i learned other OO languages. stripping other files, trying to understand and ut together your own first creation. thnx!</p>
<p>but, is there a file somewhere around wth all stndrd methods?<br>
[/quote]<br>
umm client.java?<br>
that’s the problem with most 317 sources, unorganized.[/quote]</p>
<p>i mean, something as rspscodes has all ID’s of emotes/items etc. but i need something where i can find all methods such as addng text to the chatbox, adding xp, doing an emote etc.</p>
<p>and also, since i know NPCs suck in 317 because they are always looking the same direction, end they sometimes just stand still, is there an easy way to create your own area with items and NPCs looking the wy you want t when using hyperions?</p>
<p>and last qestion: could i rip and get ideas from codes from othr 508 servers that do not run hyperion? i mean, is there a big difference between those servers? do they have their own methods or somethng? beause i cant figure out whats the dfference between things like delta/hyperion and all those other things. i think i sound noobish now.</p>
<p>however, i already learned alot more because of you posts <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>(sorry if im being an annoyng newb. i know its hard to be patient if some noob asks you a lot about stuff that sound hella easy to you. i have experience wih that. but evryone needs to start somewhere (: )</p>

              <p>yes, sorry for being lazy. i could’ve find that link myself, but now i’m sure i have the right one.</p>
<p>i already followed a lot of tuts, so now i wanted to do something harder. that’s just how i am.</p>
<p>and should i get hyperion now? cuz i really don’t get it to work. im downloading a blank 508 source now, and i will try to find some tuts and mess around a bit. i’ll try to find it myself, but if someone has a link to a usefull 508 tutorial for newbs, don’t hesitate to post</p>
<p>thns anyways, ytuio9</p>
<p>ok, i’ve got hyperion now. and i’m dead. so dead. i don’t get what the fck i have to do to make a decent server of this. it really is NOT noob compatible. lol.<br>
any other 525/508/495 base server where i have to do a lot of stuff myself, but do NOT have to write half of the game myself? :’’)</p>

              <p>Deltascape isn’t stable and It is too full of extra, useless content that people just hate it bad.</p>
<p>If your goal is to learn Java, you should head to the Oracle website and check their Java tutorials out; they’re really good imo.</p>
<p>After that, you should start out with Hyperion. It is definitely harder to code and has little content, but on the long run it will be stabler and you will learn more than you would have learned if you had started out with a deltascape that has lots of stuff added in.</p>
<p>I don’t usually like linking to other sites, but here’s your link to a 508 server base…</p>

<p>Please learn to use <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a> next time.</p>

              <p>ok. i heard alot of negative comments about delta? can someone tell me why? because it seemed pretty easy to use to me, and there are alot of tuts for it, too.</p>
<p>and i just managed to setup a vanilla 317 server with netbeans. i might not be THAT new to Java, but i seriously have nu fking idea what i’m doing :’)<br>
i might sound noobish now, but i’m missing those .java files that the base servers already have. i think i’m a bit too noob to already create my own server without even having a base, lol.</p>
<p>and i tried to setup the hyperion server with eclipse. i know a bit how to use eclipse, but i didn’t manage to get that running. eclipse always seems to give me thousands of errors. my eclypse is also slightly diff than the one in the tutorial, so i can’t find what i’m doing wrong.</p>
<p>if really hope someone with a bit experience and patience could help me with choosing the right base for a newb and tell me what kind of things i could try myself to learn more about it (i hope i don’t sound to newbish now. when i said i’m not new to java, i don’t mean i’m an expert. but i do know enough about it to write a simple code and i could understand any sort of code…)</p>
<p>and do you have a blank source of a 508+? and with a blank source? is that really blank? so i have to add almost ANYTHING myself? because i don’t mind adding stuff like skills or w/e, but it should not be too hard and i need base. just to practice.</p>

<p>no.</p>
<p>[quote=“debeste95, post:1, topic:379829”]so, here i am. a newb to RSPS’s. not a newb to Java.<br>
well, i’m here to learn more about Java and RSPS’s, and i already learned a lot the last few days. now i want to seriously start editing a base server and creating some cool stuff, but i get stuck. i’ve already downloaded like 10-20 servers and bases, but i still can’t decide. some of them don’t have any .java files (only .class) and some don’t have a client. another one’s compiler gives an error.</p>
<p>now i want to know, what would be best to do? what version? i used to mess around with 317, but what would be best, and for what one would i find most usefull tutorials?<br>
and which server would you recommend me? easy to edit, a lot to change, easy to add your own stuff, and it must also have some tutorials for it. i liked the deltascape source alot, because there are a lot of deltascape and 317 tutorials around, the only problem is, i would like to have it HD (or at least skillcape emotes) and i want them to have as much stuff as the mdoern RS has got now. so, would it be better to go to 508 or 614 or something?</p>
<p>i hope someone can help me out and give me a suggesion what source i could download best. :)[/quote]<br>
If you are, as you say, not new to Java, then Hyperion might be best for you. If you’re going to code 508+, look for a blank source and start coding stuff you want in. Also look at the packets, they teach a lot.</p>
