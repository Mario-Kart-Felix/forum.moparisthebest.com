<p>I never said not to focus on arrangement. It was just my suggestion to begin by learning your way around the software instead of diving in head first.</p>
<p>btw, my new dnb song is kickass</p>

<p>[quote=“Rictoo, post:7, topic:425620”]Sounds like you’re still getting acquainted with the software. If I were you, I’d focus more on achieving certain sounds you have in mind rather than create a full length song. Just play around with different VSTs, effects, etc for a while. That way, when you’re ready to make a real song, you’ll have the experience and knowledge necessary to make it sound decent.[/quote]I had just installed it, actually.  I don’t want to work with VSTs just yet.  I want to start creating things from scratch.  I’m definitely focusing on just working on different elements though, good suggestion.</p>
