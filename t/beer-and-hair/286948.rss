    <title>Beer and Hair !?!?</title>

    <description>Is beer really good for your hair? Counter Intelligence beauty expert Catherine Main answers your most pressing beauty questions.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Q. Hi Catherine,
I was watching the Ellen show last week and they were talking about shampooing your hair with beer to create volume. Is this true; does it work?
-- Sandra, Ottawa

Hi Sandra,
Yes, you heard correctly. It is a fact that beer is a great product to treat your hair. Just as yeast helps bread rise in the oven, the yeast found in beer causes the hair shaft to swell; therefore, creating more volume and fullness. In addition, the protein found in the malt and hops of the beer will coat each strand, healing the damage and adding overall body. The sugar will also help tighten the cuticles and add extra shine. Before you start pouring a bottle of beer over your head, I have a few tips: First, I would suggest using less than a 12 oz. bottle of flat beer. In this case, less is more and you don’t want to waste perfectly good beer. After you have finished shampooing, massage the beer for 2 minutes onto the scalp to enable it to be absorbed; then rinse and follow with a conditioner to eliminate the beer smell.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
