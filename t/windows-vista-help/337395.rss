    <title>Windows Vista Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/windows-vista-help/337395</link>
    <description>Well.. I&#39;m using one of my old computers, and it&#39;s not a bad computer tbh... and I was wondering if there is any [b]CORE[/b] ways I could speed it up.

No, don&#39;t tell me all the obvious stuff like changing virtual memory and screen resolution, Windows Colors and Style.

I mean programs or anything that will make it run at least 25% more faster with programs; Yes, My computer is set to Run best for Programs so please, don&#39;t suggest that.


Anyways, I hope you can help, I tried Google and there just obvious stuff that anyone without a brain would know.


Hope you can help.
