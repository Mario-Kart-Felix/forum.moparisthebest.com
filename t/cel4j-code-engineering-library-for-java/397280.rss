    <title>CEL4J - Code Engineering Library for Java</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cel4j-code-engineering-library-for-java/397280</link>
    <description>The last year (or years) I have been writing a library to handle binary and source code for the language Java in a diversity of ways. For example, you can read a file with the file extension .class and obtain its information by simply calling a few methods. Or you can create a tree-like structure of source code, traverse it and perform different operations on it. An example would be to reformat the code (&quot;beautifier&quot;).

The library is called CEL4J and is an abbreviation for Code Engineering Library for Java. I have plans to support other languages than Java in the future. Not only Java. And I have also started to work on a new API for EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form). You&#39;re supposed to be able to read text with this EBNF-API and create a tree-like structure from this text.

Why I am writing this topic in the first place, is because I&#39;d like to get feedback about what else someone might want to add to a library like this. Of course, if you test it, that would be great too! The version is still at 0.x, so I won&#39;t take backwardscompatibility into consideration if I have to update major parts of it at some point after this initial (alpha or beta) &quot;release&quot;. The release will contain the source code, a Jar file and Javadocs. The code is licensed LGPL.

Notice, however, that there are lots still to be done. It&#39;s not a full release. Some of the things may seem like a must-have. This is the case with reading from a data stream and building an AST and / or CST (using the Source API). But I have not had time to finish that so far. Although I do plan on adding it in the future. A lot of comments are also missing. But it takes time, considering the library contains roughly around 56.000 lines of code (including the comments).

              <p>krackkid: Yeah perhaps. Well, after all, if you search for CEL4J on Google , that website is one of the first results you’ll get. I didn’t check that earlier, so I wasn’t really aware of it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Anyway, I have now also added this project to Sourceforge, but not updated the “public” version so far. Not because I havn’t done anything since I wrote this topic. Because I have! Now you can parse pretty much any Java construct (via the Source API). I can parse every single production rule, but some of them still have bugs and thus won’t work as expected in all cases - so I won’t upload the current version just yet. The parser is a Backtracking Parser (a form of Recursive-Descent Parser (a Top-Down Parser) for LL(k) grammars, but with an arbitrary lookahead (I guess we can also call it an LL(*) Parser)).</p>

<p>sinisoul: If you downloaded it, you will be able to see the source. Then you will also be able to find the code to parse the .class file. It’s very simple, actually. To answer your question more accurately; yes, I did parse the bytecode on my own.[/quote]</p>
<p>Alright I commend you then. Good job; I trust you enough to not look.</p>
