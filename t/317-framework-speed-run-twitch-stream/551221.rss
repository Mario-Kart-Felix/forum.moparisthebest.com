    <title>317 Framework Speed Run - Twitch Stream</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-framework-speed-run-twitch-stream/551221</link>
    <description>[url=http://twitch.tv/sinisoul]Check out the stream here[/url]
[url=http://github.com/Hadyn/speedrun]Check out the repository here[/url]

[b]Done for today![/b]

The stream starts at 7 PM Mountain Time and will continue until 3 AM Mountain Time. Occasional breaks will occur, but it will not be interrupted.

After the stream is finished I will link the broadcast. I will talk about practices I uphold while programming, and history of the protocols and other information people may find interesting. I will also incorporate facets of Andrew Gowers original scripting system and how it is essential to take into consideration when designing modern frameworks.

Edit: I streamed for 4 hours straight and was experiencing some fatigue. I will be back soon to continue this for another 4 hours just to see how far it gets, then obviously 8 more increments until the basics are done :)
