    <title>RSCDv25 original release</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rscdv25-original-release/546967</link>
    <description>Does anyone still have the original release of RSCD v25? I have a few variants that purport to be RSCD v25, but I&#39;m unsure which is the real one (without any alterations by people after reines&#39; release).
I&#39;d like to know though.


Are there any distinguishing features? Package names? Anything like that?


One seems to use the package format org.rscdaemon.*, has a quest package (org.rscdaemon.server.quest), and comes with a sprite editor.
Another uses the same package format but doesn&#39;t come with a quest package.


Then there&#39;s another one using com.rscd.* for the package format, and comes with this TODO list:
&lt;blockquote&gt;- Following
- Stop walking to someone elses tile?
- drag ammy teleports
- Need to &quot;know&quot; the map serverside too, validate walk paths and make sure straight line for spells/range - stop walking through walls
- large piles not disappearing as they should
- Removing wall objects needs coded
- Drinks - wine, tea etc - Poison and zamarok potions too - Grog
- Add remaining spells (except npc ones for now)
- Check skulls are working properly
- CookingDefs are missing wine, fancy pizza types, choc cake, lava eel
- Need a tiny wait between eating/drinking etc
- Add smithing
- Friend list still fucked
- Ores/Logs/Fish etc should have &quot;weight&quot; values in their Defs
- A new thread with a server socket listening for admin commands (only bind to localhost for security?)
- Finish weapon aim/power/etc
- Harvest all ladder coordinates
- Check for missing objects
- Create all item spawn points
- Remove duplicate telepoints, objects, items etc
- Need a throttle on commands
- The username to long function in php creates invalid values for usernames over 8? chars, needs a different approach.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Notably, the client included in this release is the regular RSC client - not the RSCDaemon client (with the green colourscheme).
Also, the last modified date on many of the files in this release was June 2007.


Halp me guys, someone here will know. I&#39;m also happy to share all of these as I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if existing links anywhere are dead (these files came from a backup DVD I made in 2008, ).</description>

<p>Reines never released rscd, it was PR4Y who leaked it.</p>
