    <title>What happend to the classics</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-happend-to-the-classics/447516</link>
    <description>Ok, so we all know runescape rsps&#39;s and rs to be quite modern with all their fancy new torva and curses, but what happened to all the 508 rush pk&#39;s and the 508 pvp drop servers, and... well... runescape... what a let down... ever since they took the wildy down its never been the same... for example the eco&#39;s crashed, you cant buy anything without a nub selling it for 10m more than its worth... the only good thing about rs now is the fact that they added a teleport system to each town/city with no cool down, back in the day people used to cry over loosing 1m, now you get people in GE asking for it... 

What should happen?
they should restart rs, keep the base of today but reset everything, make drops harder, focus less on the graphics are more on the fixes, change there shitty slow new website theme to something more classical like the RS2007 site, AND STOP MAKING IT SO MUCH LIKE WORLD OF WAR CRAFT...
this new combat bar is 100% the same as world of warcrafts combat bar except their xp bar is our adrenalin bar...

The conclusion i have found when reviewing all this info is that the new makers of rs are just in it for the money, unlike the original owners who did it for the players, as you can see, adverts on rs have quadrupled membership prices have nearly doubled, wheel of fortune spins, loyalty points... all this new shit that&#39;s directed at 11 year old kids who dont know what to spend their pocket money on...

so, i want to hear some of your views on what rs has to be shamed for, after all... they dont get there nickname &quot;Fagex&quot; for nothing :)</description>

<p>These changes are for the better, it may be a shocker to hear this but Jagex needs money to continue on with runescape, without money runescape is gone.</p>
<p>The updates are good, all people do is bitch how how they liked old ruenscape better and they want jagex to make it like it was in 03 or 06 or some shit. If Jagex didn’t ever update the game then you would be playing the EXACT same shit for 10 years, whats the point in that?</p>

What i mean by top-heavy is that it’s one of few games where people from all level-ranges generally hang out in the same areas, and in many cases train various skills together, be it individually or through the various popular minigames.</p>

<p>Belland: Are you serious? Is making the interface efficient the same as copying ALL MMORPGs? If anything Jagex has improved on the old display from MMORPGs.

By showing you the weakness you are saving people some time, as everybody would just look it up anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ahh finally a person who does have some sence of maturity…<br>
And no, making that interface makes the game WOW because of the facts…</p>
<p>WoW Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>3D, Massive Worlds</li>
<li>More than combat skills to level</li>
<li>Trade System</li>
<li>NPC dialogues</li>
<li>Combat bar<br>
ect…</li>
</ul>
<p>RS Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>3D, Massive Worlds</li>
<li>More than combat skills to level</li>
<li>Trade System</li>
<li>NPC dialogues</li>
<li>Combat bar</li>
</ul>
<p>Now i know what your going to say “every mmo has these”, well yes… but that’s like saying that FPS’s for example are all the same because of there fetures<br>
ammo display, guns, hit markers ect…<br>
well no… Every game is different because the makers of it make something for the game to be distinct about…<br>
so why is RS going to be So similar to WoW, well its because of the fact that there is nothing different…<br>
the features are 99.5% the same…</p>
<p>ok right someone post back with a feature that’s not the same… then il begin to agree with your DEBATE…<br>
[/quote]Play some other MMO’s and then come back. RS is one of maybe 4 or 5 MMO’s that specifically ARE NOT WoW-clones. Some notable things being: A more vibrant economy, hybrid skill/level based progression system with no skill caps (classless), RISK - losing items (to an extent), very little player-funneling (zone-running) and virtually no top-heavy player distribution.</p>
<p>Sidenote <span class="hashtag">#1:</span> Most, if not all of the features WoW has were used in Everquest several years before its release, all they did was polish them.<br>
Sidenote <span class="hashtag">#2:</span> Non-combat skills in WoW are a secondary thing, in RS there are tons of people who EXCLUSIVELY play the game for non-combat, you cannot do this in most other mmo’s.</p>

<p>What defines a MMORPG:</p>
<ul>
<li>XD, Massive Worlds</li>
<li>More than combat skills to level. (You should have some crafting professions)</li>
<li>Trade System (You can’t have an economy without trading)</li>
<li>NPC dialogues</li>
<li>Combat interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not about that every MMORPG have it, it is about that every MMORPG must have it to fit the genre.</p>

              <p>Well bro, after that comment I just laugh at you.</p>
<p>Just because you think its turning into WOW doesn’t mean their copying. All they are doing is making there game better and on par with the other MMO’S. If you really think WOW is better, which it looks like you do because that’s all you fucking mention, then fuck off to WOW and stop complaining.</p>
<blockquote>LOL?!? your an idiot... you think its just me who lost intrest in this game? half of fucking youtube agree's with me... in fact... no i take that back, i didn't loose interest, i still like the game, but its like dharok amour... when you first get it, its brilliant and strong... but as time go's on it degrades and then you have to repair it for it to improve again... and yeah it was exiting in the classic days where i shit my self to loose 25k to a goblin, but that's what made the game fun... risk... now i laugh at loosing 10m in a duel and just think 'oh, nvm il just get another 10m' and yeah i did find the game more fun back then because everything was new, but that statement contradicts your point... you just said that i dont like the game because its not new to me, but you say the world map his huge now? and more content is going to be added / is already added? please think about what your saying before you make your self look so stupid... im not the ignorant one you are... im just making a discussion pointing all the bad thing out and stating how they could be improved, your turning this into an argument... and yeah they are making it like wow, example:
<p><img src="http://phpgame.bugs3.com/wowbar.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
This is wows bar, it dispaly all attacks availible with the xp, and the opposition info in the green context menu…<br>
now look at this:<br>
<img src="http://phpgame.bugs3.com/rsbar.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
rs’s bar with all attacks displayed<br>
<img src="http://phpgame.bugs3.com/rsbar2.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
context menu/interface with opposition info</p>
<p>Sorry what’s that, the new updates not like wow? if you cant see the the 95.5% resemblance then you really need to consult an optician about your vision…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-Half of YT don’t even play RS, WTF are u on?<br>
-Barrows have always degraded, why are you complaining. If you dislike repairing, don’t use it.<br>
-Don’t blame Jagex for the way money has turned out in this game because they have no part of it, It’s the players.<br>
-Half of that doesn’t make sense. GJ<br>
-All he is doing is discussing his opinions yet you go raging because there completely the opposite.<br>
-WOW didn’t make everything sorry to tell you.</p>

<p>Oh my… really… just really… ohhhh my fucking god… -_- <em>facepalm</em><br>
This is a discussion board… did you not read the title before entering?</p>
<blockquote>Are you really going to make threads bashing a game you don't enjoy anymore due to a few updates that didn't appeal to you? and what will you get out of it?

This is like saying "why does every one complain about flamers, there not going to stop just because people rant at them" OBVIOUSLY NOT, that's not the point in a discussion... we complain because THERE'S SOMETHING TO FUCKING COMPLAIN ABOUT... like im complaining about you now... does this mean your going to suddenly join my views? NO, but im still complaining at you? and yeah they might be a business, but DOES THAT STOP ME FROM MY VIEWS? just lessen to what im going to say, and lessen hard you pathetic 9 year old child who think's he knows it all... once you get some friends, Yes FRIENDS add that word to your dictionary... you will realise that there might be something in life that you dont like.... yeah hard to imagine right? and someday you will make a conversation on the topic with your FRIENDS... this is called SOCIALIZING.... (&lt;- talking to another form of the same spices)...
<p>for example… people in working class counties complain at their governments because they give benefits to people who dont need them, and cut peoples pensions down…<br>
now ranting on about the government wont change their mind… but people still do it? are you starting to get the idea now?</p>
<p>Ohh and FYI i dont hate Runescape, in fact i play it today… i just dont like some features/or most of what they have done to it…</p>
<p>also… you say that this update will be good in the long run?.. how do you know? its not even been released… it might destroy the game even more…</p>
<p>Now… if you want to add something to this DISCUSSION without being a sarcastic little basterd, please do… i dont mind people sharing there views or disagreeing with me, but when you direct your argument at me, il come right back at you in spite…</p>

Blame the people who started the whole gambling scene, not the game.

What I meant to say is, you get sick of playing the same game all the time no matter what kind of changes come, that varies by different people.

This is a discussion thread and there must be atleast some arguments between the members, not everyone thinks the same as you and would like to share their thoughts.
<blockquote>Sorry what's that, the new updates not like wow? if you cant see the the 95.5% resemblance then you really need to consult an optician about your vision...</blockquote>
Yes, because WoW is the almighty god of all MMORPGs right? Almighty WoW thought of everything. Even if it looks similar to it, what is bothering you so much about it?

Who said i was expecting them to do anything? it was my opinion of what would make the game better…<br>
and yeah so what if there a business, the customer is always right… and yeah they can evolve like every other game, but why destroy it just because your spoilt for cash? for example, the average player count each day in 2007 was about 150k and its the same today… so really what have they achieved? in fact they have lost players as about 75k of them today are botters… people dont play games because they look good, they play games because they are good… but from the posts i have seen on this topic its quite obvious that most of you didn’t start playing until the revision 508 or you would know this…<br>
[/quote]1. They are not making it like World of Warcraft.<br>
2. There’s nothing wrong with the game (except the presence of bots for now), stop grinding skills/pking for a second and do some quests, kill some stuff for drops and you will see the game is worth something, the world map is huge at the moment and I’m pretty sure it will keep growing giving us more stuff to do.<br>
3. Most of us here did start before the 508 revision, some even from the first RS2 days. You only miss the old times because that was the time where you first found the game and everything was new explorable where even the slightest bit of GP would make you cry of happiness, with the time passing by you grow out of the game and it gets boring. People like you are too ignorant to realise that it’s not the game, it’s just you who lost interest.[/quote]</p>

<p><img src="http://phpgame.bugs3.com/wowbar.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
This is wows bar, it dispaly all attacks availible with the xp, and the opposition info in the green context menu…<br>
now look at this:<br>
<img src="http://phpgame.bugs3.com/rsbar.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
rs’s bar with all attacks displayed<br>
<img src="http://phpgame.bugs3.com/rsbar2.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
context menu/interface with opposition info</p>
<p>Sorry what’s that, the new updates not like wow? if you cant see the the 95.5% resemblance then you really need to consult an optician about your vision…</p>
