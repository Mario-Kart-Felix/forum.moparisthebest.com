        <p>Well bro, after that comment I just laugh at you.</p>
<p>Just because you think its turning into WOW doesn’t mean their copying. All they are doing is making there game better and on par with the other MMO’S. If you really think WOW is better, which it looks like you do because that’s all you fucking mention, then fuck off to WOW and stop complaining.</p>
<blockquote>LOL?!? your an idiot... you think its just me who lost intrest in this game? half of fucking youtube agree's with me... in fact... no i take that back, i didn't loose interest, i still like the game, but its like dharok amour... when you first get it, its brilliant and strong... but as time go's on it degrades and then you have to repair it for it to improve again... and yeah it was exiting in the classic days where i shit my self to loose 25k to a goblin, but that's what made the game fun... risk... now i laugh at loosing 10m in a duel and just think 'oh, nvm il just get another 10m' and yeah i did find the game more fun back then because everything was new, but that statement contradicts your point... you just said that i dont like the game because its not new to me, but you say the world map his huge now? and more content is going to be added / is already added? please think about what your saying before you make your self look so stupid... im not the ignorant one you are... im just making a discussion pointing all the bad thing out and stating how they could be improved, your turning this into an argument... and yeah they are making it like wow, example:
<p><img src="http://phpgame.bugs3.com/wowbar.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
This is wows bar, it dispaly all attacks availible with the xp, and the opposition info in the green context menu…<br>
now look at this:<br>
<img src="http://phpgame.bugs3.com/rsbar.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
rs’s bar with all attacks displayed<br>
<img src="http://phpgame.bugs3.com/rsbar2.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
context menu/interface with opposition info</p>
<p>Sorry what’s that, the new updates not like wow? if you cant see the the 95.5% resemblance then you really need to consult an optician about your vision…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-Half of YT don’t even play RS, WTF are u on?<br>
-Barrows have always degraded, why are you complaining. If you dislike repairing, don’t use it.<br>
-Don’t blame Jagex for the way money has turned out in this game because they have no part of it, It’s the players.<br>
-Half of that doesn’t make sense. GJ<br>
-All he is doing is discussing his opinions yet you go raging because there completely the opposite.<br>
-WOW didn’t make everything sorry to tell you.</p>

        <p>Belland: Are you serious? Is making the interface efficient the same as copying ALL MMORPGs? If anything Jagex has improved on the old display from MMORPGs.

<p>Sorry? Did you read my post… or did you just get thrown really hard at a brick wall as a baby?<br>
if you would have attempted to read on, you will find you just agree’d with my statement… this is a discussion board… that means you have a debate WITHOUT getting into an argument, which near 100% of the people on this post provoked…</p>
<p>So i realize now that i cant discuss anything on this forum as most of the people on here dont have the will to not argue…<br>
therefore making this topic post pointless and irrelevant…</p>
<blockquote>Well bro, after that comment I just laugh at you.</blockquote>
Well "Bro" i have to laugh at you -_-, only 9-12 year olds use the term bro (or some really fucked up kid that has the mental age of 9-12)
your post further concludes my point, this there not a person on this forum older that the age of 16 that i can talk to with out some childish response?
i though this was more of a java development dedicated to the game RS2, not some kids forum were we all worship "RuneScape"...
<p>Grow some balls and get out once in a while… you will see the earth is bigger than just runescape’s 2D map…</p>

<p>Ahh finally a person who does have some sence of maturity…<br>
And no, making that interface makes the game WOW because of the facts…</p>
<p>WoW Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>3D, Massive Worlds</li>
<li>More than combat skills to level</li>
<li>Trade System</li>
<li>NPC dialogues</li>
<li>Combat bar<br>
ect…</li>
</ul>
<p>RS Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>3D, Massive Worlds</li>
<li>More than combat skills to level</li>
<li>Trade System</li>
<li>NPC dialogues</li>
<li>Combat bar</li>
</ul>
<p>Now i know what your going to say “every mmo has these”, well yes… but that’s like saying that FPS’s for example are all the same because of there fetures<br>
ammo display, guns, hit markers ect…<br>
well no… Every game is different because the makers of it make something for the game to be distinct about…<br>
so why is RS going to be So similar to WoW, well its because of the fact that there is nothing different…<br>
the features are 99.5% the same…</p>
<p>ok right someone post back with a feature that’s not the same… then il begin to agree with your DEBATE…</p>

well no… Every game is different because the makers of it make something for the game to be distinct about…<br>
so why is RS going to be So similar to WoW, well its because of the fact that there is nothing different…<br>

<p>What defines a MMORPG:</p>
<ul>
<li>XD, Massive Worlds</li>
<li>More than combat skills to level. (You should have some crafting professions)</li>
<li>Trade System (You can’t have an economy without trading)</li>
<li>NPC dialogues</li>
<li>Combat interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not about that every MMORPG have it, it is about that every MMORPG must have it to fit the genre.</p>

<p>perhaps, but from my perspective of playing post 2010, i found the game to be entirely different in its player-base. my reply was directed more at the ‘top-heavy’ and ‘people still skill’ comment. my observation was that there were far more elites (high combat/high wealth) than noobs. furthermore, most of the people i bumped into didn’t train skills. they’d be in the 120+ range with something like 50 mining…</p>

perhaps, but from my perspective of playing post 2010, i found the game to be entirely different in its player-base. my reply was directed more at the ‘top-heavy’ and ‘people still skill’ comment. my observation was that there were far more elites (high combat/high wealth) than noobs. furthermore, most of the people i bumped into didn’t train skills. they’d be in the 120+ range with something like 50 mining…[/quote]From my own experience of having played somewhat actively for the past 3 years, my statement is still accurate. What i mean by top-heavy is that it’s one of few games where people from all level-ranges generally hang out in the same areas, and in many cases train various skills together, be it individually or through the various popular minigames.</p>

        <p>World of Warcraft isn’t the first game to use an action bar, and as we can see, won’t be the last either.</p>
<p>These changes are for the better, it may be a shocker to hear this but Jagex needs money to continue on with runescape, without money runescape is gone.</p>
<p>The updates are good, all people do is bitch how how they liked old ruenscape better and they want jagex to make it like it was in 03 or 06 or some shit. If Jagex didn’t ever update the game then you would be playing the EXACT same shit for 10 years, whats the point in that?</p>

        <blockquote>Well "Bro" i have to laugh at you -_-, only 9-12 year olds use the term bro (or some really fucked up kid that has the mental age of 9-12)
your post further concludes my point, this there not a person on this forum older that the age of 16 that i can talk to with out some childish response?
i though this was more of a java development dedicated to the game RS2, not some kids forum were we all worship "RuneScape"...
<p>Grow some balls and get out once in a while… you will see the earth is bigger than just runescape’s 2D map…</p>

<p>So by your logic, i’m between 5-8. LOL, like I said, use a brain for once in your life.<br>

Grow some balls? Oh wait, that’s right… i’m 5-8 years old. My bad.</p>
 <blockquote>Sorry? Did you read my post... or did you just get thrown really hard at a brick wall as a baby?
if you would have attempted to read on, you will find you just agree'd with my statement... this is a discussion board... that means you have a debate WITHOUT getting into an argument, which near 100% of the people on this post provoked...</blockquote>
<p>Really? What you type is just pure immature, young teenagers say stuff like this proving that you are around 10 years old.<br>
This is a discussion board, not where you rage at someone else’s opinion that disagree’s with you. You also started the argument, maybe you should calm down and go outside.</p>
