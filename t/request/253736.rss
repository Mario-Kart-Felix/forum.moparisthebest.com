    <description>I am lookin for a small signature. Size 384x160


I want it to be about smoking weed and drinking beer. A green color scheme with weed and heineken. I do not want a solid background. The want the background to be a medium green and the text to be black. A glassy look would be appreciated. I want my name (&quot;igetst0ned&quot;) in a black color, somewhat stony and more closed and subtle.


Thanks to anyone who participates</description>
