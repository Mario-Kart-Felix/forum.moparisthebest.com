    <description>[b][u]below is the conversation i had with him/her[/u][/b]


JACK says:
hi?

Fate says:
Hello

JACK says:
who are you?

Fate says:
I know this is awkward

Fate says:
but can you possibly wait 10 minutes

Fate says:
all shall be explained ok?

JACK says:
no problem

Fate says:
just tad busy now i promise i will tell :)

Fate says:
Ok back sorry about that

Fate says:
Ill explain now

JACK says:
ok

Fate says:
Well im here to basically ask you if i can have your services

Fate says:
You see, if your a rs player you should know about SixFeetUnder correct?

JACK says:
no i dont what is it?

Fate says:
He was the first player to discover the first dupe

Fate says:
Anyways more to the point

Fate says:
Hes developed a program called SF-Scape

Fate says:
its semi private, you wont have heard of it

Fate says:
Hes offering tests on a new script

Fate says:
And ive been sent around to ask rs players who i know fully well cheat

Fate says:
IF you&#39;d like to know more about the program just tell me

JACK says:
ye i would

Fate says:
Ok ill get you a link now

Fate says:
ITs contained in a .rar file

Fate says:
You extract and run the program

Fate says:
[b](this is where he sent me link to rapidshare ive removed it to prevent any curious
people from going on there downloading what it was and possibly getting scammed)[/b]

Fate says:
their you go

Fate says:
It has a built in authent system with your own programmed id by ip

Fate says:
so we can monitor your test

JACK says:
good try lol but im not an idiot

JACK says:
you like scamming?

Fate says:
Im not a scammer.

Fate says:
want the sf scape information?

JACK says:
yes

Fate says:
Sf-scape developed by SixFeetUnder/bumis/g0ne is a delphi based runescape
macro. This bot was based on the private version of Autorune developed
by apd/raw/josh. 

Why is Sf-scape undetectable?

Simple, the way people were banned from runescape for using macros is
that the time between each click was the same, to render that issue
ive designed it to click randomly, it will not always click on a npc,
it might pm a friend asking how he is? or what hes up to etc. Another reason
people we detected as using a macro is the amount of time there account 
was logged into runescape. To render this issue, Sf-scape will log in for 15 hours
a day at random times of the day/night. 

What special features does this macro have?

Well, to be fair, it doesnt have special features, just unique ones
such as pm reply, and public chat reply. It has over 4000 auto responces. 
If it has a reply, it will simply say &quot;sorry no time to chat must be off&quot; and run 
3 load screens away, then go back. 

Fate says:

Pking - It has a built in pkbot. On the minimap, it only shows people who can attack you.
Green dot for lower levels, yellow for same level Red for higher levels. For those ddser&#39;s and rangers
it also has a fancy little feature that when you go from anywepon to a DDS on switch it will
automaticly be ready to special. while fighting If you have a mele wepon in yor
hand, it will turn on and off the best prayer you have, giving you another little advantage.
Fate says:
And the pking is what you would be testing.

JACK says:
well sorry to disappoint you but im not going to do it

Fate says:
Thats fine

Fate says:
Thanks for your time anyways

Fate says:
Have a good Day/Night, dependant on your timezone

[b]im pretty sure he got my email from this site and could target any of you next, so just be careful and don&#39;t fall for it unless you want your runescape items stolen[/b]

[b]so watch out for aceoffate@gmail.com[/b]

[/quote]<br>
no i didnt scan it tbh i didnt want to go any where near it[/quote]<br>
I’ll scan it for you. I have 3 firewalls and Kaspersky Anti-Virus with Norton Anti-Virus. So i will not allow it to connect through to the internet and send other information. I will send a Jotti’s scan with my very own virus scanners. Please send me the download link and i will have a proper scan.</p>
<p>Thank-you!</p>
