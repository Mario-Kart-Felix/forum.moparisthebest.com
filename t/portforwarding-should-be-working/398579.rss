    <title>Portforwarding - Should be working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-should-be-working/398579</link>
    <description>I have tried everything, I am desperate to try and get this to work, I have no idea why it will not work because I have followed many different tutorials and done exactly what I am supposed to do.

<p>You see, there is this program named Hamachi, it allowed different users to connect to each other.<br>
Firstly, use u torrent and do a port check ( 3rd option in preferences )<br>
Download Hamachi &amp; your first experiance with it will give you all the knowledge you need.</p>
<p>FREE*[/quote]</p>
<p>hamachi = epic fail, if you cant manage to portforward dont bother posting a server</p>
<p>OT: google a program called simple port forwarding, thats what i use for all my portforwards it will do it all for you you just choose your modem model and the ports you wanna forward</p>

<p>Hamachi sucks… If he wanted to use it he would be asking, but hes asking for portforwarding help, not about Hamachi. Go somewhere else.</p>
