    <title>Changing the color of objects (trees)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-color-of-objects-trees/549208</link>
    <description>Greetings all!

I create bots for RSPS&#39;, and I find it would be a hell of a lot easier if I could change the color of certain objects, such as a tree.

I use Pascal language (with Simba program) to create color oriented bots, and although I can use DTM&#39;s and other functions to help find if I&#39;m clicking the right object, it would simplify all my code if I could change the color of a whole tree to lets say red, and have the bot search for that color.

tl;dr

How can I change the color of objects such as trees, ores, etc.?

Thanks!</description>
