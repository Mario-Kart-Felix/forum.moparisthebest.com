    <title>Connection Error - Retrying in [] (Detailed)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-error-retrying-in-detailed/389904</link>
    <description>Hello Moparscape. I&#39;m quite new to these forums, and quite to RSPS hosting, however, I&#39;m pretty old in the Runescape world. Anyways, I have a major problem that I&#39;ve been working a day+ on to try to fix, but can&#39;t.

Everytime I open my html, the java loads, however, the client says &#39;Connection Error - Retrying in [Seconds]. I&#39;ve googled this and looked pretty hard for an answer. I cannot find one. I follow Ric&#39;s Webclient tutorial for 317 servers. It works good, except for this problem. I have portforwarded both UDP and TCP prt 43594. My download link is correct, and it is a direct download. My server ip is the corrent no-ip. I&#39;ve been wasting my time trying to fix this problem. If anyone could please help, it would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks!</description>

<p>Alright then it’s a cache problem. It’s probably because t’s looking for the cache in directory A, when it downloaded in directory B.</p>

<p>Is the ‘C’ in “Connection Error” uppercase or lowercase?</p>

              <p>Welcome to the forums!</p>
<p>I’ve had this problem before. I would be on a client, and it works fine (meaning there is nothing wrong with variables etc). I would then try a different client and I would get this error. I always believed it to be something to do with the cache, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p>I’m sorry that I couldn’t be much help. Bumps this up if anything.</p>
<p>Do you have problems running other clients/webclients?</p>
