    <description>Hello i have a problem in the vexillumRS source
i posted a topic about this before but no help...
so... problem is :
problems in login [sometimes]
and random dc&#39;s
and sometime [random times] it dc all players and who logins after that also dc it[and says &quot;You already logged please try again after 60 seconds&quot;.

I think its server nulled, but how that can happen without even any1 playing tested it for soem time the game is online i only one connected , and it just happens...XD

no its not SYIPKERS, Not getting DDOSED, nothing like that just happens from the server..

Any suggestions, i know someone who fixed it [ProtocolRS] but they wont help me ... so ... help?
