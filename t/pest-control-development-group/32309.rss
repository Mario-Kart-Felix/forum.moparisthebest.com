    <description>Welcome to the thread of the pcdg. I am too lazy to type it out so it&#39;s now called the pcdg.

Here we are looking for GOOD, SERIOUS coders to help us with making pest control.

Any coder that joins us MUST have the endar client.

We have not decided which source to use yet, we are taking suggestions.

Current coders:

-sk8ter
-OPEN
-OPEN
-OPEN

Also, coders must have msn.

Post here to apply with proof that you are good.

Once I accept you, add my msn (it&#39;s at the left).

Anybody not accepted that adds me on msn and wants to join will be blocked.

After we are finished it will be decided whether to make a tut, put the source for download, or keep it private.

But mostly, we&#39;re just here to have fun!</description>
