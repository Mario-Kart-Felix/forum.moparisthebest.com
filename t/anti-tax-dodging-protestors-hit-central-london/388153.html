<p>A plutocrat called Philip Green runs some of the biggest retail stores in the country, his empire includes Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Miss Selfridge and British Home Stores.<br>
Yet, Philip Green employs an army of accountants to help him dodge tax. In recent years this has cost the British taxpayer £295 million. To put this into perspective, it could pay for the salaries of 20,000 NHS nurses.</p>

<p>So we hit him where it hurts, in his pocket. We had a sit-in in the flagshop Topshop store in Oxford Street. We closed it down to business on that busy Saturday and handed out leaflets to damage their reputation and encourage our rulers to close the tax loopholes.</p>
<p>Vodafone dodged £6 billion worth of tax. To put this into perspective, cuts of welfare are valued at £7 billion.<br>
So we did the same, sit-ins at the Oxford Street Vodafone store.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/18/article-1339844-0C873C54000005DC-124_468x316.jpg" alt width="468" height="316"></p>
<p>Our government tells us lies that There Is No Alternative and We’re All In This Together. They destroy out welfare state while allowing rich oligarchs to pay little or no tax.<br>
We believe everyone should pay their fair share of tax.</p>
<p>Even the Chancellor George Osborne is a tax dodger. The company he inherited from his dad pays accountants to make him avoid £1.6 million worth of tax.<br>
23 of the 29 members of our government’s cabinet are millionaires. How can they possibly understand the normal man or woman on the street?</p>

        <p>This is fine, as long as it is realized that ‘tax dodging’ is only part of the problem.  The other part is that many government officials get paid far too much, and couldn’t care less about overspending our tax dollars (because it’s “other people’s money”).  Near me, for instance, the city of Franklin has something like a $200,000 hole in it’s budget to fill, and I looked up the top city employee’s earnings in 2005 and 2009 (when most people lost their jobs, or are earning far less than they did before), the city manager for instance went from earning $65,000 in 2005 to $99,000 in 2009, how the hell did he get a $34,000 raise during a recession?  If you add up the raises from 2005 to 2009 from the top 10 employees, there is your $200,000 deficit!  They should drop those people to their 2005 salaries, and if they don’t like it, there are plenty of people around here without jobs that would be more than happy to work for that amount of money.  I’m sure this same thing is happening everywhere else as well.</p>
<p>I think the solution is to have voters decide how much to pay elected officials, not the elected officials themselves, there is no other job in the world where you get to set your own salary!  Also, the kind of person that would work as a senator for example for $45,000 would have a lot more common sense, and represent the people much better, than a person who would only work as a senator for $200,000.</p>

<p>Obviously we’re arguing for a change in the law.<br>
Also just because something is legal doesn’t make it moral. These companies are freeloading off our society. The government would send police and the fire brigade to protect them if they needed it but they give nothing back.<br>
Some companies, like John Lewis or The Co-op are quite decent and pay tax in line with both the letter and the spirit of the law.</p>
<p>OK moparisthebest sure, lets try to fix both problems. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>Haha sign says owes the nation 300 billion, if he legally avoided paying taxes then he doesn’t owe you anything. I dodge taxes every year through various loopholes and I bet a majority of the people protesting have dodged a certain tax in some small way or just didn’t pay their taxes at all. But they apparently think its only bad when big business do it even though these big businesses employ a shitload of people. Its the peoples fault that this is possible anyway, maybe if half of fucking society would pay attention to elections and who they put into office they could have avoided this whole situation but no, Its only when the shit hits the pan and people organize to bitch about the problem, which the majority of the time resolves nothing.</p>

        <p>[quote=“mwiebelhaus, post:6, topic:388153”]Haha sign says owes the nation 300 billion, if he legally avoided paying taxes then he doesn’t owe you anything. I dodge taxes every year through various loopholes and I bet a majority of the people protesting have dodged a certain tax in some small way or just didn’t pay their taxes at all. But they apparently think its only bad when big business do it even though these big businesses employ a shitload of people. Its the peoples fault that this is possible anyway, maybe if half of fucking society would pay attention to elections and who they put into office they could have avoided this whole situation but no, Its only when the shit hits the pan and people organize to bitch about the problem, which the majority of the time resolves nothing.[/quote]I love people who can’t debate and just throw assumptions in every direction!</p>

        <p>I read a funny article in the Telegraph trying to make out like the protests were terrible and were hindering business. True, but give some damn attention to the tax dodgers. It only mentioned them being “accused of tax dodging” once.</p>
<p>mwiebelhaus, I don’t like much about how the world is ran, but if we have to pay taxes then so should the businesses and everyone should be doing so proportionally. Dodging it is what helps cause the horrendous recession we just had. The human race’s biggest downfall is greed. Greedy corporate types who’ve got such a bent perception of reality they think money matters, or maybe they think it buys happiness. It’s something I’ll never understand.</p>

        <p>If the rich can find ways to evade excessive tax then you can too. Perhaps you just aren’t crafty enough.</p>
<p>Enough of that though. The same thing exists here too, with richer members of society (namely James Packer as far as I know) paying considerably less tax than people in blue-collar jobs.</p>
<p>It’s probably worth mentioning that most of the people who complain about this kind of thing tend to believe in the pie theory (that is, the world has a fixed amount of wealth in it, and for someone to have more, somebody else must have less).<br>
Paul Graham elaborates on why this is a fallacy:</p>
<blockquote>I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else. Many people seem to continue to believe something like this well into adulthood. This fallacy is usually there in the background when you hear someone talking about how x percent of the population have y percent of the wealth. If you plan to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you're planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.
<p>What leads people astray here is the abstraction of money. Money is not wealth. It’s just something we use to move wealth around. So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to trade with other people for things you want, there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world. You can make more wealth. Wealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.</p>
<p>Suppose you own a beat-up old car. Instead of sitting on your butt next summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition. In doing so you create wealth. The world is-- and you specifically are-- one pristine old car the richer. And not just in some metaphorical way. If you sell your car, you’ll get more for it.</p>
<p>In restoring your old car you have made yourself richer. You haven’t made anyone else poorer. So there is obviously not a fixed pie. And in fact, when you look at it this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What these protesters are doing is taking it out on this guy for being a winner. He’s playing the game, and apparently he’s flogging the shit out of it.</p>
<p>I’m trying to decide whether this is an incidence of tall poppy syndrome. After all, he’s not doing anything illegal really. He complies with the laws just like all of those protesters presumably do.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a class="mention" href="../../u/greeny-2.html">@Greeny</a>: If money doesn’t matter then why are people protesting against this guy for keeping a worthless commodity to himself?

        <blockquote>So we hit him where it hurts, in his pocket. We had a sit-in in the flagshop Topshop store in Oxford Street. We closed it down to business on that busy Saturday and handed out leaflets to damage their reputation and encourage our rulers to close the tax loopholes.</blockquote>
Seems pretty spite-driven to me. If you want to protest a law then make your way to parliament house with picket signs.
<p>This was targeted spite in my opinion. In short, ‘Rage rage rage this guy owes the government money rage rage rage let’s try and undermine his bottom line today so that, in terms of opportunity cost, it was ever so slightly less advantageous to avoid paying that tax’.</p>

<p>Money shouldn’t matter, is perhaps better phrasing.</p>
<p>My only argument could be that in an “ideal” world, we’d be rid of most of the useless shit in the world and concentrate on important things like science and space travel. (Especially considering most governments have cut the latter from budgets, even though it’s probably the most important thing the human race will EVER DO).</p>
<p>I find it atrocious, and devastating at the same time. I also feel helpless in the fact I was born into this world and wont actually be able to do anything about it. Am I alone?</p>

<p>If it wasn’t for religion amongst other things we’d be far more advanced. The human race could have been in order by now but it failed, and it failed miserably. My major concerns come from the fact the general public have no desire to explore our universe and to expand. OK so it maybe a little early to consider actual space travel. However, we need an agenda for it, since now space programs have all been scrapped.</p>
<p>We have our priorities backwards, people only care about TV, the entertainment industry, God, Money, their jobs and Steve Jobbs because we’ve got no focus. No-one appreciates the world outside of the faulty perception.</p>
<p>How many people each day take into consideration the size of the universe?

The human race can’t even get its house in order. Just look at the middle east, and Africa.<br>
The last thing the human race needs to worry about, at least in the politically correct world, is the space-faring age.</p>
<p>Of course, on the other hand, if politically correct first-world countries decided to stop giving a shit about the third world tomorrow then the people in Africa can starve, the people in Libya can be bombed, and the world can keep spinning on a tilted axis.<br>
The rest of time and space won’t even notice.</p>
<p>As a race, humanity is reaching the height of its decadence. The only thing the people of the world care about is talking, rather than doing, and red tape. Lots of red tape.<br>
The good news is that I’ll probably be dead by 2100.<br>

<p>If it wasn’t for religion amongst other things we’d be far more advanced. The human race could have been in order by now but it failed, and it failed miserably. My major concerns come from the fact the general public have no desire to explore our universe and to expand. OK so it maybe a little early to consider actual space travel. However, we need an agenda for it, since now space programs have all been scrapped.</p>
<p>We have our priorities backwards, people only care about TV, the entertainment industry, God, Money, their jobs and Steve Jobbs because we’ve got no focus. No-one appreciates the world outside of the faulty perception.</p>
<p>How many people each day take into consideration the size of the universe?

<p>I don’t know much about this specific case, but there are a lot of cases where the CEO (or major shareholders) dodge income taxes. The money they earn end up in Switzerland or the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>Nobody is getting laid off because of them actually having to pay taxes. If every company has to pay taxes, you don’t lose anything of your competitiveness and won’t have to fire people. Dodging is actually a way of getting an unfair advantage over company’s that play fair.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/greeny-2.html">@Greeny</a>: You’re absolutely right. It’s frustrating to see how people fill their days with watching the X-factor, discussing the X-factor, and spending a shitload of money on the X-factor (by voting). There’s a lot of potential wasted by people doing shit that doesn’t matter. Today, happiness is defined by the goods you own. Not by the use they have.</p>
<p>Some of those who actually try to understand that there’s more out there than just our planet quickly return to their caves because it’s too much to grasp. We need more Carl Sagan, less Simon Cowell.</p>
<p>On a slightly related note: How fucked up is it, when a Dutch bank that received massive state support (€10 billion!) and hasn’t payed back everything yet, decides to give it’s top management a bonus (€1.25 million for the CEO alone)? Thanks to pressure from the customers the bank decided not to give the bonuses, too bad it had to come that far.</p>
