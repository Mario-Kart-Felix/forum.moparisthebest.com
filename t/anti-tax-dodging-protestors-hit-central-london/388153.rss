    <description>This is an totally original story. I&#39;ve just come back from protests.

A plutocrat called Philip Green runs some of the biggest retail stores in the country, his empire includes Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Miss Selfridge and British Home Stores.
Yet, Philip Green employs an army of accountants to help him dodge tax. In recent years this has cost the British taxpayer £295 million. To put this into perspective, it could pay for the salaries of 20,000 NHS nurses.

So we hit him where it hurts, in his pocket. We had a sit-in in the flagshop Topshop store in Oxford Street. We closed it down to business on that busy Saturday and handed out leaflets to damage their reputation and encourage our rulers to close the tax loopholes.


Vodafone dodged £6 billion worth of tax. To put this into perspective, cuts of welfare are valued at £7 billion.
So we did the same, sit-ins at the Oxford Street Vodafone store.

Our government tells us lies that There Is No Alternative and We&#39;re All In This Together. They destroy out welfare state while allowing rich oligarchs to pay little or no tax.
We believe everyone should pay their fair share of tax.

Even the Chancellor George Osborne is a tax dodger. The company he inherited from his dad pays accountants to make him avoid £1.6 million worth of tax.
23 of the 29 members of our government&#39;s cabinet are millionaires. How can they possibly understand the normal man or woman on the street?

Our American friends also have a group.

I understand they occupy Bank Of America and Verizon because they pay zero ($0) tax.</description>

<p>There’s no need to bring taxes up, there’s a need to enforce tax laws. Basic government finance: Taxes come in, expenses go out. Differences between the two are dealt with via the financial markets. The US knows how to use these markets!</p>
<p>You should read this article Frell: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/business/economy/25tax.html?_r=1&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=ge&amp;st=cse" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/business/economy/25tax.html?_r=1&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=ge&amp;st=cse</a></p>
<p>Please understand this: We (the European members of this forum) aren’t always right either, and I for one sometimes like to argue with you just for the sake of arguing. But also understand that you’re being fed lies. I don’t know who it’s doing, but someone is.</p>

<p>You guys are so quick to think that as soon as a company gets tax cuts the CEO’s are going to give themselves raises and just pocket the extra profit. What actually happens is the money goes to Health insurance for employees, retirement programs for employees, shareholders, reinvesting into the company, and research and development.</p>
<p>Of course, you guys don’t have to worry about the first two, so the extra money can go to the government so it can provide those things.</p>

<p>So what? Throw out some minimum wage jobs and help the starting generation of workers. That allows more pay/positions for management that goes to the people who are actually applying themselves and have a career with the company.</p>

<p>What is GM going to do? Move all it’s production lines to Mexico? If Americans are so proud of their own car brands, would they take it when GM does that? I doubt it. American car brands stay alive because of the ‘made in the USA’ tag.</p>
<p>Besides, this basically is saying to the small business ‘you either grow or pay taxes’. Not every businessman wants to grow into a huge corporation. The day there are only huge corporations left (ie a plutocracy) I’ll retire to a cave.</p>

              <p>[size=10pt]2/3 of American Corporations Pay No Federal Taxes[/size]</p>
<blockquote>Bank of America hasn’t paid a nickel in federal income taxes for the past two years, and in fact raked in an additional $1 billion in tax “benefits.” The bank is enjoying these profits after accepting $45 billion from taxpayers, which the company then got to count as a deduction when they paid back the money.
[..]
This is why two-thirds of corporations in America pay no federal income taxes. If they were forced to, we're told, the whole country would suffer. Jobs would be lost, salaries slashed. Thank heavens we’ve avoided such calamity by allowing corporations to shape legislation in their favor.
<p>In 2010, Bank of America handed out $2.2 million in campaign contributions to Congressional representatives and PACs (36 percent went to Democrats, 64 percent to Republicans). By throwing around that much cash, huge companies like BoA have a big say when it comes to crafting legislation that permits them to escape paying taxes, according to US Uncut organizer J.A. Myerson.</p>

<p>You don’t have any savings? If not, then I partially agree with mwiebelhaus. This crisis is caused by a bubble in the housing market, and I won’t put all the blame on banks. People seem to forget that banks want to make profit too, and just like car dealers they don’t always tell the complete truth.</p>

<p>Its called living about your means, and its your own fault if you were to stupid to not budget properly and not plan for the worse.</p>
