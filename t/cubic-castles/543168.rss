    <title>Cubic Castles</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cubic-castles/543168</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been playing this game which has been in beta for about a week now, Cubic Castles.

It&#39;s a 3D platformer/sandbox MMO in which you can build your realm or visit others. You can create everything in your realm, buildings or trails for others to complete.

It may look like another minecraft clone but really, it isn&#39;t.
Just give it a try, it&#39;s not even 25MB.

This is being developed by three former PopCap developers in C++ from scratch. They are really active and listen to the (small) community of beta-players to fix and update the game almost daily.

At the moment it&#39;s Windows and Mac compatible. It&#39;s also coming to Linux, Android and IOS.

              <p>They’re going for a big playerbase right now! Due to some advertising today there were 60 players online at once, which is a record up to now!<br>
Any of you here know soms communities to promote games like this? Or another way to address lots of people?</p>

If Cubit Store is a microtransaction system then FUCK THAT.<br>

The cubit store is a store in which you can buy the blocks which you can also mine, the clothes and tools which you can also craft and extra realms!<br>
You pay with cubits, the in-game currency<br>
You’ll receive cubits by mining but you can also buy cubits</p>
<p>Buying cubits is really not necessary, it’s more of a way to support the devs![/quote]<br>
Ok that’s more like it :P. So long as there is an equally obtainable amount of ways to get those cubits, then I have no problem with them selling. Honestly if Jagex had done that with Runecoins the game would have been better suited to deal with microtransactions. Obviously now they have more ways, but it still doesn’t involve playing the game to achieve those coins. I may check this out, thanks!</p>
