    <title>A virus that&#39;s undeletable (An alert to watch out for)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-virus-thats-undeletable-an-alert-to-watch-out-for/91478</link>
    <description>Not too long ago, my uncle emailed a bunch of people saying Microsoft just discovered a new virus that can&#39;t be deleted yet. It can steal any info from you, and just mess your computer up. They said it was recieved by an email, hotmail, etc... And the title is &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; With an attached file. DO NOT OPEN IT!!!! It holds the one virus that can&#39;t be deleted. So keep an eye out for it, and immediately delete it.

Send this to everyone you care for, or notify them of it!

              <p>lol well i had a few viruses that i thought were un removeable, they linked themselves to winlogon and explorer.exe, so if i was booted i windows, i couldn’t delete them… explorer one was easy to get rid of, winlogon one i had to get a special program to edit eveything, change my regestry about 50 times, and a bunch of other stuff before i could remove it</p>

              <p>Hmm… Old? Hoax? That sucks, I guess I just spammed <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> Curse my uncle… &gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>Feel free to delete then, I guess. But I’ll quote my Uncle’s email.</p>
<blockquote>*****   I M P O R T A N T W A R N I NG   *****
<p>Anyone-using Internet mail such as Yahoo, Hotmail, AOL, and so on.<br>
This information arrived this morning, Direct from both Microsoft and<br>
Norton.<br>
Please send it to everybody you know who has access to the Internet.</p>
<p>You may receive an apparently harmless e-mail with a Power Point<br>
presentation “Life is Beautiful”. If you receive it DO NOT OPEN THE<br>
FILE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, and delete it immediately.<br>
If you open this file, a message will appear on your screen saying<br>
“It is too late now; your life is no longer beautiful.”<br>
Subsequently you will LOSE EVERYTHING IN YOUR PC, and the person who<br>
sent it to you will gain access to your name, e-mail, and password.<br>
This is a new virus which started to circulate on Saturday after-noon.<br>
AOL has already confirmed the severity and the anti-virus software’s<br>
are not capable of destroying it.<br>
The virus has been created by a hacker who calls himself “lifeowner”.</p>
<p>PLEASE SEND A COPY OF THIS E-MAIL TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS and ask them to<br>
PASS IT ON IMMEDIATELY!</p>
<p>THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY SNOPES.<br>
EVEN IF IT IS A HOAX, BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY!</p>

<p>Anything as old as the virus you mentioned (if it were real) would be covered by the latest virus definitions. But the McAfee Threat Center is a good place to find info about the latest and most dangerous bugs: <a href="http://www.mcafee.com/us/threat_center/default.asp" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mcafee.com/us/threat_center/default.asp</a></p>
