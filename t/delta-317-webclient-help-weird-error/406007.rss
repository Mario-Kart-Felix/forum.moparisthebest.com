    <title>Delta 317 webclient help - WEIRD error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-317-webclient-help-weird-error/406007</link>
    <description>ok so i used ric&#39;s webclient tutorial, had to do a little extra modifications in some places but i used it for the main cache downloading and extracting.
the client is unusually organized with java files in the main folder, class files in a folder named bin, and sign and java zoom folders in the main folder. i jarred the main folder into a  jar file which works when the cache is in the c:/ drive, but when it has to download the cache instead of NORMALLY saying like
------------------------------------
|||||| cache downloading - 20%      |
||||||                                         |
------------------------------------

instead it does something like  :confused: :confused: :confused:


------------------------------------
| cache downloading - 12365%       |
|                                               |
------------------------------------

for a second it has some random number over 1000 as the percentage, then it stops and gives me a connection error

it works when its not jarred, and i jarred it correctly. it also works when the cache is in the c:/ drive. has anyone experienced and error like this before? help is appreciated</description>
