2.Why does the server crash most every 30 minutes?<br>
Becuase this will prevent it lagging later<br>
THE GUIDE HAS BEEN UPDATED FOR 3.1! THE PICS ARE THE SAME BECAUSE THE STEPS ARE THE SAME, BUT I CHANGED THE LINK!</p>
<p>Ok, because I have seen loads of questions about the same things, I decided to make an up-to-date guide to MoparScape.<br>
<em>NOTE</em> - This Guide (Currently Wink) Does Not Cover Private Server Creation!</p>
<p>Step 1. Go to “C:/Program Files/Java” and see if you have a folder named “jre1.5.0_8”.</p>
<p><em>IF YOU DO, THEN SKIP TO STEP 5, OTHERWISE CONTINUE BELOW</em></p>
<p>Step 2. Download the latest JRE from this link: <a href="https://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" rel="nofollow noopener">https://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a></p>
<p><em>IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING YOUR OWN SERVER, THEN DOWNLOAD THE LATEST J2SE DEVELOPMENT KIT (JDK)</em></p>
<p>Step 3. Once the download you selected is done, follow the very simple instructions to install. The installation may take several minutes.</p>
<p>Step 4. Restart your computer if prompted.</p>
<p>Step 5. Download the MoparScape Private Server Client from this link: <a href="http://rapidshare.de/files/31495394/MoparScape31.zip.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://rapidshare.de/files/31495394/MoparScape31.zip.html</a> (Scroll Down, Then Click “Free”)</p>
<p>Step 6. If you do not already have it, download and install WinRAR from the official RARLabs link: <a href="http://rarlabs.com/rar/wrar36b8.exe" rel="nofollow noopener">http://rarlabs.com/rar/wrar36b8.exe</a></p>
<p>Step 7. Right-Click MoparScape30.zip (or the current version at the time you read this), and click “Extract Files…”.</p>
<p>Step 8. Specify where you want the folder to be located, then click “OK”.</p>
<p>Step 9. Find the folder that MoparScape was extracted to, and open it.</p>
<p>Step 10. Double-Click on “runMoparScape”.</p>
<p>Step 11. Wait until the cache is automatically downloaded.</p>
<p>Step 12. If you would like to play on your own basic HybridScape, click “Start Server”.</p>
<p><em>NOTE</em> - If you choose to start the HybridScape Server, you will be playing by yourself on an empty version of RuneScape. Your Friends CAN NOT connect to this.</p>
<p>Step 13. Find a server that you would like to connect to that is online, by using a Status Checker, such as RS-Server’s, located here: RS-Server Status Checker <em>NOTE</em> - This Screenie Is OUT OF DATE, do not go by it!</p>
<p>Step 14. In the MoparScape window, click “File” at the top-left.</p>
<p>Step 15. Click “New Server”.</p>
<p>Step 16. In the window that pops up, enter the IP of the server you would like to connect to, and click “OK”.</p>
<p>Step 17. Make up a Username and Password, then log in!</p>
<p>~Hamachi~</p>
<p>Hamachi is a program that allows you to connect to some servers that you would not be able to otherwise.</p>
<p>If you would like to connect to a server that requires Hamachi, download the Hamachi Client from the Official link: Hamachi</p>
<p>Hamachi has a built in Step-By-Step Tutorial that will explain EVERYTHING you need to do to connect to the Server.</p>
<p>~Trouble-Shooting~</p>
<p>Q: My automatic Cache download isn’t working/is having errors, how can I fix it?<br>
A: Manually download the Cache from ~HERE~, then extract it into the “C:\WINDOWS.mpr_file_store_32” folder.</p>
<p>Q: When I try to play, it only gets through X Mb, then stops/I am having the “Error Connecting - Retrying in 60” error, how do I fix it?<br>
A: Same as above, this error normally occurs when you have a bad internet connection, or dial-up. Try closing all programs that use the internet, to get the maximum power out of your connection, then try again.</p>

Question Where can I find server IPs? And how do I use them?

Answer The server IP list is here. Go to file&gt;&gt;New Server&gt;&gt; and enter the IP.


Question I get a 'java not recognized', or 'exception in main error'. What's wrong?

Answer You might not have the latest version of java, or more interestingly, you may have the latest version of java but your computer is not aware you have the latest version of java. Here is a noob-friendly guide to installing java and declaring it's existence to your computer:

Question Why doesn't this door open? And this fish get eaten? And this spell cast...and...?

Answer Moparscape is a private server client and server. Private servers hav been programmed from the ground up by us, the cheating community (more specifically, WinterLove, who created the server). The features private servers have, they have because they have been painstakingly created.  If you want to add things to your Moparscape server, look in this section of the board:

Question What's a Runescape client/server?

Answer The Runescape client is the user interface end of the program, and makes requests of the server. The server delivers the information to the client. So the client generates the graphics whereas the  server tells the client what graphics to display. The client prompts you for a username, whereas the server checks that username against a database and tells the client whether or not it is a real account.  Runescape bots are usually heavily modified clients that automatically do things.

Moparscape is a client and a server packaged together.


Question I attacked a monster and Moparscape froze. How can I fix this?

Answer Make sure the monster has HP, as attacking an HPless monster will freeze your game. You can change monsters HP by looking in "NPC.cfg" with a text editor (Such as notepad, or if your cool, textpad).

Useful Moparscape Commands:
You can find these and more yourself at line 685 in clienthandler.java

::item
This spawns an item. A full list of items is in "Items.xml" in your hybridscape folder. For example "::item 1319 1" spawns a rune 2handed sword. The first number is the item ID, the second number is the number of items.

::emote
This command makes you preform an emote. For example "::emote 3". You can many kinds of emotes. They are quite interesting to say the least.

::pickup
You may use this command like the item spawning command, except the items appear in your inventory. For example "::pickup 1319 1" picks up one rune two hadner.

::mypos 2
Displays your postion, height, map region, etc.

::tele
This command can teleport you to somewhere. Usage is "::tele X Y". For example "::tele 3213 3425" teleports you to varrok center.

::goup
This moves your character up.

::godown
This moves your character down.

::npc
This command spawns an NPC. The full list of NPCs is in "NPCs.xml" in your hybridscape folder. For example "::npc 420" spawns a zombie.

::pnpc
This command changes you to an NPC. For example "::pnpc 500" turns you into a jungle warrior.

::pass
This command changes your password. For example "::pass bonefish" changes your password to bonefish.

Ok.
Why people keep on asking for item codes I don't know. But again here it is.
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,20363.0.html
Now, Please read the rules and read this guide!
[TUT]
I/O can be VERY useful if you want to carry information over from one session of running your Java program to another. I assume you at least have some knowledge of Java, as I will not go into the basic stuff. We'll start off with reading from a file. We have to import the I/O package:

[code]import java.io.*;[/code]

Next, put together your class and add this to it:

[code]public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
	{
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("File.txt"));
	}[/code]

Let's just throw an exception, since we haven't gone into exceptions yet. Now that we have what we need to read from a file, lets actually read from it. I use the readLine() method to read (For no particular reason - I'm just used to it.), and every time you execute it, if you execute it again it will move down to the next line automatically.

[code]String all = "";
String line = "";[/code]

Let's declare two Strings, one to hold the current line and the other to store the entire file. Now to read from the file:

[code]while((line = br.readLine()) != null)
		{
			
		}[/code]

Now, that block of code pretty much says that line is equal to whatever br reads from the file, then it makes sure it doesn't equal null (The file is empty or were at the end.) Now to do something with that:

[code]while((line = br.readLine()) != null)
		{
			all += line + "\n";
		}[/code]

That will run through the file, storing every line in the String line, then when it finds that the file has ended (line = null), it will exit the loop. That's the end of the file reading, now for the fun part. Writing to a file. We start off the same way as reading, import java.io.*, create your class, then continue. For reading we used the BufferedReader class and for writing we will use the PrintWriter class.

[code]PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("File.txt"));[/code]</code></pre>
