    <title>2 Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-questions/425091</link>
    <description>I have 2 questions to ask, so lets begin,

1. I have been working on a PI for the past while now, but I feel that when I put this up my players will not enjoy it, because it is older, (i like older but it seems rsfags do not), so I need something loading like a 508+ cache, and something that is a stable base, not bugged to death like insidna-X, any suggestions? (I am probably gonna be asked to do a Hyperion and other such things, I have messed around with them, but I want a PI, don&#39;t tell me other wise)

2. I have been trying to work on getting my cooking to run, but this line here,
[code]
if (c.playerCooking &gt;= f.getReq()) {
[/code]
Does not let me cook sharks, which have a req of 80, but it lets me cook shrimp, with a req of 1, if I switch the symbol, it does the same, but vise versa, oh one more thing, anyone got a good cooking formula? Mine is horrible..</description>
