    <description>[center][size=17pt]Questions[/size]

[b]~~~[u]Teleporting Problem[/u]~~~[/b]
When ever i seem to teleport in my new server (because my old server had a lot of errors/viruses/lag) it seems it wont teleport me When ever i try to teleport it will take me to my location but somehow it will keep me little but i want to stay big instead of having to log out constantly because of some error (it gets very annoying)
[u]Example[/u]:

~~~[b][u]Summoning[/u][/b]~~~
OK , I Absolutely hate summoning in my server it lags the hell out of every one in my server , i have tried for ages looking for tutorials on removing this but i have seen none. does any one know how to remove the full thing please port your links bellow if its the link to the tutorial.

 
~~~[u][b]IP Ban[/b][/u]~~~
i have a thing i made in my server.java that makes them ipbanned but not in the way yours will work because if u normally ip ban some one it will let them on in a new acc but i can only do m new code in a text doc so I&#39;m gonna need the ipban code for this to totally rock so if u have the ::ipban code post it bellow but u have to know that most of your ones that you will post will be wrong and it only kicks them so i need the actual ipban code.
