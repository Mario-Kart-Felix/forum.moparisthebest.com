    <description>I am in a sagemcom Sky router and struggling to port forward.

UPDATE - I think whats throwing me more is that in my router there is two internet protocol, ipv4 and ipv6, any help will be much appreciated!

Okay before anyone has ago at me, i have tried searching all sorts of tutorials on portforwarding and tried as best as i can to do it but nothing seems to be working, so what I&#39;m after is someone who maybe can teamveiw or skype and look? I&#39;ve been at it for  2 days now, i&#39;ve done the services for the ports 43594 and added them into my firewall rules, but when i check it on canyouseeme.org it says connection refused. Any help appreciated!! my skype is jason.b451 thanks :D 

EDIT - I&#39;ve changed things round in my router and the error message i get now is connection timed out on canyouseeme.org, anyone know whats causing this?</description>

              <p>Did u also open server port on your firewall? both out and in.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes it does not show it, but when u put server run, it works fine. For eg. <a href="http://canuseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canuseeme.org</a> cant see my vps’ being all portforwarded and running unless server is online.</p>
