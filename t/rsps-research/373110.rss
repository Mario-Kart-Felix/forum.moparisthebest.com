    <description>So I want to do a little research to distinguish what the majority of people consider to be an appealing server.

If you would be so kind as to fill my short survey out, I can then tally up all the results and base my server around that.

[i]Note: if an answer doesn&#39;t completely meet your standards, then please select the next most satisfying.[/i]

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Which of the following XP rates appeals to you the most?[/b]

A: Normal RuneScape XP (1x) - (so you&#39;d get 4 XP for every 1 damage)
B: Double RuneScape XP (2x) - (so you&#39;d get 8 XP for every 1 damage)
C: Low rate (10x) - (so you&#39;d get 40 XP for every 1 damage)
D: Medium rate (100x) - (so you&#39;d get 400 XP for every 1 damage)
E: High rate (1,000x plus) - (so you&#39;d get 1,000 XP plus for every 1 damage)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Do you prefer a variety of items included in the game (junk also) or just the good stuff?[/b]

A: I prefer thousands of items so there&#39;s always something different.
B: I prefer just the necessary weapons, armour, food and rares.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Do you like the map to be used and accessible all around the world, or just a few places, like teleports?[/b]

A: I like to explore the map in search of new training areas and secrets.
B: I like to teleport to a handful of places and just get on with it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Do you prefer a skill to be temporarily unavailable or in use but limited means of training available?[/b]

A: Unavailable until it is ready.
B: Just release it, I don&#39;t mind repetitive stall clicking.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]If something isn&#39;t complete, say for instance an NPC&#39;s walking, attacking and death animation, should it be added?[/b]

A: I don&#39;t mind the glitched heads and stretchy legs.
B: I&#39;d rather not see it until it&#39;s added properly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Do you mind if things are mixed up a little bit? (Items, NPCs and some other things used for stuff other than what they are really intended for in the real RuneScape.)[/b]

A: Things should stay in their relative boundaries.
B: Something new and different, so long as it ain&#39;t stupid.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Which of the following?[/b]

A: Some items and areas unavailable to normal players. Members and/or Donator only.
B: Free for all. No ranks, no members, no restriction.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Do you care about presentation?[/b]

A: A good server always has a one line welcome message, spelling and grammar is correct, NPCs don&#39;t walk through walls, objects are arranged neatly and not cluttered.

B: Tightly-knit homes and lifeless looking NPCs all facing in one direction doesn&#39;t bother me. I don&#39;t mind every skill to be trained in one area and a bank in every corner for ease.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Tradition?[/b]

A: Traditional Wilderness.
B: &#39;PK boxes&#39; for quick PK&#39;ing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Prefered Server? - Give name and number, ie. &#39;Hyperion 317&#39;.[/b]




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is all that springs to mind at the moment, more for personal use than anything and would be muchly appreciated if people took 10 minutes to give me the feedback I&#39;m looking for. 

I&#39;m looking for about 100 people to complete the questions.

Either copy the quote and emphasise the answers you choose, or merely type in the letters as a reply. It&#39;ll be fine.

Thanks for reading.</description>

<p>Doesn’t matter, but if you want stable it seems you already have the idea. As long as it doesn’t lag and is nicely worked with, it works for me.<br>

Probably =P. Of course you will always have the one person who wants to do a survey…They don’t want to make their server too unappealing to people  :P.</p>

<p>A: I don’t mind the glitched heads and stretchy legs.</p>
<hr>
<p>Do you mind if things are mixed up a little bit? (Items, NPCs and some other things used for stuff other than what they are really intended for in the real RuneScape.)</p>
<p>A: Things should stay in their relative boundaries.<br>
Just add new customs ^^</p>
<hr>
<p>Which of the following?</p>
<p>B: Free for all. No ranks, no members, no restriction.</p>
<ul>
<li>You could have a donating page on your site. But people don’t tend to like restrictions… Unless you want to make some customs you made for mods to be unavailable to your players who are not mods?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Do you care about presentation?</p>
<p>A: A good server always has a one line welcome message, spelling and grammar is correct, NPCs don’t walk through walls, objects are arranged neatly and not cluttered.</p>
<p>B: Tightly-knit homes and lifeless looking NPCs all facing in one direction doesn’t bother me. I don’t mind every skill to be trained in one area and a bank in every corner for ease.</p>
<p>I agree with half of each of these.</p>
<ul>
<li>I do not mind where you have your home/ where you put your shops.</li>
<li>Having the command ::bank eliminates the need to have a ‘bank in every corner’ too if you would consider that.</li>
<li>I <span class="bbcode-i">would not</span> like skills to be trained in one area however.</li>
<li>Grammar / Spelling is good to have, but doesn’t really impact gaming performance too much…unless it really is not understandable.</li>
<li>I don’t mind NPC’s walking through walls, long as I can get to them. Having ::noclip would make sure that if they went to an area you really could not get to, you could use it, and get to where they are. Aber, <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> people ( not sure who ) do not like ::noclip, so maybe NPC’s walking through walls is not good. Unless you have the bug in the server where you can attack the NPC’s with mage…then the NPC’s could attack the person back…and go through a wall even to get to them. I am not sure on this one…do what you feel is necessary.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-i">‘objects are arranged neatly and not cluttered.’</span> Place things where you want them  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> , it does not matter that much. Long as people can get to it, it is fine.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Tradition?</p>
<p>A: Traditional Wilderness.</p>
<hr>
<p>Prefered Server? - Give name and number, ie. ‘Hyperion 317’.<br>
Only The Best 317— I’d like to see what somebody can do with it =P<br>
Hyperion is much better though.</p>

Emps-Scape. I loved the sound mainly. And how the combat is exactly how 317 was. It just made me nostalgia is all. Don’t play private servers much.</p>

<p>This is all that springs to mind at the moment, more for personal use than anything and would be muchly appreciated if people took 10 minutes to give me the feedback I’m looking for.</p>
<p>I’m looking for about 100 people to complete the questions.</p>
<p>Either copy the quote and emphasise the answers you choose, or merely type in the letters as a reply. It’ll be fine.</p>
