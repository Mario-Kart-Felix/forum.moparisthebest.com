    <title>Photography contest</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/photography-contest/536067</link>
    <description>So the General Discussion section isn&#39;t getting much publicity at the moment. There isn&#39;t much new topics being brought up. So seeing as some people here are interested in the photography arts, I was wondering that maybe a few members including myself can hold a photography contest. Somewhat similar to the old modelling contest. 

[u]The winners reward?[/u]
 Well I do not think that any staff member would approve some sort of badge because it is completely irrelevant to this website. We&#39;re open to suggestions I guess. Maybe the satisfaction of a virtual handshake from the judges?

[u]What will we be assessed on?[/u]
 You will be mainly marked on the theme, techniques and editing skills. By techniques I mean the use of depth of field, rule of thirds, lines, framing, focus, contrast etc.

[u]How will this work?[/u]
 You will signup using the information provided below. You will then be given a week to take raw photos with no editing, submit them before or on the due date. You will then be given 3 days to edit the images. Hint hint, I think surrealism would be the best approach to get the judges attention, though, if you do not already know what this is then don&#39;t bother.

[b]Signup Exemplar:[/b]

[ul][li][b]Your name is:[/b] Mason McLeod[/li]
[li][b]The theme I will pick is:[/b] Time Travel[/li]
[li][b]Experience with photography:[/b] Student[/li]
[li][b]Camera:[/b] Cannon EOS 1100D[/li][/ul]


[b]Signup Template:[/b]
[code]
[b]Signup Form:[/b]

[ul][li][b]Your name is:[/b] INERT HERE[/li]
[li][b]The theme I will pick is:[/b] INSERT HERE[/li]
[li][b]Experience with photography:[/b] INSERT HERE[/li]
[li][b]Camera:[/b] INSERT HERE[/li][/ul]

[/code]

Reason why I posted this here first is to gather an idea of how much people would participate. That and to hopefully gather a few suggestions.

A bit of work I have done myself.

Unfortunately my best work was left at school. I should see about getting em back.</description>

perhaps a “community event” rather than a competition would be more fitting for the first for events</p>
