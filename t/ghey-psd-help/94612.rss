    <title>Ghey PSD...Help? :-\</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ghey-psd-help/94612</link>
    <description>Mmmk, so last night i was making a sig, and it was looking good, but i had to get off so i saved it as a psd. And now i can&#39;t open it, it says &quot;Could not complete your request because the file is not compatible with this version of Photoshop&quot;. I can open other psd&#39;s, but not this one, it doesn&#39;t really matter because i got the stock from my pack, but i don&#39;t want it to happen if i do an awesome sig then i forget what i do if i want to make a tutorial.

So, thanks in advance. -Kaza.</description>
