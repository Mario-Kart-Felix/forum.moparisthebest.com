    <title>Instant Error On Every Client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/instant-error-on-every-client/234768</link>
    <description>Ok so it starts off like this, i look for a server to go on, found 2 servers that looked good with heaps of good info and so on, but they required a client to play, so i downloaded the client, opened it, typed user and pass, and an INSTANT and i mean hardly a milisecond, just pops up &#39;Error connecting to server&#39;. so i looked at the mopars server status page again and waited till it updated to see if tht server was down or not, the answer was NO it was still on, but i still yet get errors rapidly like that... so i tried my second found server and the SAME THING happens. but the odd thing is, a server, Flamepkz has a client WHICH I CAN go on easily without getting those errors! so is there like, something i gotta edit in the run.bat files in the clients that i have a problem with? if so, please do say so.</description>
