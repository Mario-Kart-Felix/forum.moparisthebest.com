    <title>How do i add commands?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-add-commands/415359</link>
    <description>i have the hybrid pvp server and i dont know how to add a command like ::home or something like that. i guess this client doesnt have any commands like ::home but whenever i tried to add some to it under the source files and then under client.java i cant seem to get it to work. I have team viewer so if you know how to do it we can teamview. or if you know how just leave a comment. thanks</description>
