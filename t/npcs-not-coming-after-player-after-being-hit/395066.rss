    <title>NPC&#39;s not coming after player after being hit?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npcs-not-coming-after-player-after-being-hit/395066</link>
    <description>I have an NPC walking around, and after i hit him and then click one block away he doesn&#39;t come after me, how do I change this? This is very essential for my server!

Jad will ALWAYS fight even if you walk by him, so I can&#39;t copy and paste the code from him, I need it so only when you attack a monster he&#39;ll come after you and fight you.

This is making me very angry, i&#39;ve been searching for two hours...</description>
