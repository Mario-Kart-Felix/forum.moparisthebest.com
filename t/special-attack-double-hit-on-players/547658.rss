    <title>Special attack double hit on players</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/special-attack-double-hit-on-players/547658</link>
    <description>When I use a special attack that is supposed to show multiple hits at the same time (dds, d claws, msb) it does not display both hits, but it does the damage for both hits.

Whenever I use special attacks on NPC&#39;s, it shows all of the hits.

This lead me to believe that the problem was in the attackplayer method, so after comparing it to the attacknpc method, and trying all kinds of things even copy and pasting PI&#39;s attackplayer method and I STILL have the problem.

Any help is greatly appreciated. I think I have narrowed it down to the handleHitMask method but I could be wrong.</description>
