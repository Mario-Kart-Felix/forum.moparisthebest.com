    <description>Hey I have a few questions about the larger client and the sprites and the chat location as well as the location of where popups are located on the Larger client screen.

Ill number then so that when you can answer the questions you can start by stating the number to the question.

[b]For the Larger Client:[/b]

1. What are the sprite numbers for the~
         -Bar on the Bottom (Chat History/Quest History Etc...)
         -The Bar on the top (Inventory/Map/Stats Etc...)

2. Where would I look to change the [b]Amount[/b] of lines of previous chats on the screen? (Don&#39;t just say mudclient or something. [b]Explain[/b] to me where to look)

3. Where would I look to change the [b]Location[/b] of where the chat starts EX: Usually it starts on the bottom of the screen but with the enlarged client it starts in the middle (Don&#39;t just say mudclient or something. [b]Explain[/b] to me where to look)

4. Where would I look in order to change to l[b]ocation on the screen for where a popup would show up[/b]. EX. when I type the simple ::online command, it shows up in the upper left corner of the screen instead of the middle of the screen.

5. I know I saw a recently posted Tutorial as to how to edit Client Images/Buttons. If that link can be reproduced it would be great :P

ReportHandler Quick Question.

6. I followed the guide from http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,403414.0.html and this is the error I received. Look Below.

<p><span class="bbcode-b">3. = </span> Search for <code>chatHandle = gameMenu.method160(7, 324,</code> The number ‘‘324’’ is what you change lower it it goes up higher it it goes up, pretty simple.</p>
<p>To fix the right click on the big client you can easy search for (510) and (315) Change these numbers to whatever your client size is.<span class="bbcode-i">( You might didn’t ask for it)</span></p>
<p>What goes on the box in the onlinelist i quess you could make an box method for it.</p>
