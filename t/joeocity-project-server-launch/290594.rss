    <description>[b] I WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR IS THAT THIS IS NOT A ADVERTISEMENT TO COME PLAY ON THE JOEOCITY SERVER[/b]

[center]This is the release of the joeocity project server][/center]

The joeocity project is a project for minor coders like myself to join together and pool there knowledge. This was only a team of 5 that made this server but it is very complex but goes back to the basic. Here are some of the key features.

-Completely Built off of hybridscape source
-New game engine 
-New ban email system connected to email server
-Will be host with multiple server
-Able to handle multiple worlds and share users
-Very adaptable and flexible for change
-Anti Exploit System
-Able to add grand exchange as soon as I convert the GE source
-New user and IRC intergrated system
-Much More!

The Server is dated to be up and running in a few weeks but beta testing will start soon. I am not asking for testers so please do not ask.

Things that are still in need of work-

-Engine and Base Server (Finished)
-Players Storage (80% done)
-Email and IRC server (Finished)
-Main Control Server (50% done)


I will post more once the source is finished.
