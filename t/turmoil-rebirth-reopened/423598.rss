Patience: (lot or little?) A lot.<br>
Do you give in to others? No, if someone tries to make me mad I just ignore then or troll them back<br>
Do you fall to bribes easy? Nope<br>
What could you help improve on the Server? Well, since I was recently a Moderator of your server (I’m Techno), I could improve a lot of things and make it like it used to be.</p>

<p>Also, I don’t think you will find many people wanting to join this unless you do show pictures.  Or AT LEAST some information about the server.<br>
It does not take that long.</p>
