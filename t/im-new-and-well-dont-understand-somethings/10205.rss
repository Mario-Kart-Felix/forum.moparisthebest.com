    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-new-and-well-dont-understand-somethings/10205</link>
    <description>Ok yes I am new just started today and I would like to make my own server and already have the downloads and all done just dont know how to import things...of course I thought i could use my like HTML brain but this is used my Java and I dont know that...yet...anyways

Can someone please answer my questions?

1. How to you have your server online and how do you well....get on it?

2. What is client.java? i see some codes and says Open Client.Java and well I dont know what that is so...What is it and where can i find it?

3. Where can you find a easy understanding Java Tutorial?

4. How does the whole putting monsters and everything where you want it work?

I&#39;m sorry about asking I am just dont want to sit here stressed and not get anywhere when i could be learning something new! I would really like to start up this server for well...mostly for my family to play on and I told them about it and they are really excited and pumped so...I dont want to let them down... 

Thank You!</description>

              <p>1.) Look for a turioul</p>
<p>2.)After you download a source then there will be a sub title called client</p>
<p>3.)I will send you a good site and it has really good turiouls and other stuff about private servers, but don’t want leaches and noobs to start coming to it.</p>
<p>4.)open the npc, then make it so it has hp and see its id number. go to autospawn and set it somewhere.</p>
