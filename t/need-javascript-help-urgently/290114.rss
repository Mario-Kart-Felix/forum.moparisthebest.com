    <description>Hey guys it me, wow been a while since I&#39;ve been on MITB.

I&#39;m making one of my teachers a photography website and need some help.

Check out these sites to understand what I want:

- http://html1.photobiz.com/html_gallery.cfm?menu_itemID=162273&amp;load=html
(This is the site I&#39;m basing mine off of.  I can&#39;t just steal the javascript because it uses an external file.  I want an image viewing script as close to this as possible, if not exact same.  See the thumbnails on the right, then the option to click next and it loads more images, the next button and loading more images is what I&#39;m having trouble with.)

- http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/thumbnail2.htm
(I&#39;ve got this free javascript script and it&#39;s almost perfect.  The only problem is once I go over like 7 pictures it starts stretching my website out.  So basically if it had the &quot;next&quot; option which loaded the rest of the pictures like that first site I gave you then it would be perfect.)

- http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/cmotiongallery2.htm
(This one would work for what I want since it will scroll through all the pictures, but...  I place it in the right column of the table, and can&#39;t figure out how to make the pictures open in the left column of the table.)

Any help is greatly appreciated!


[b]EDIT:[/b]  in response to [u][i]Server-Unknown.net&#39;s[/i][/u] post
[quote=&quot;Server-Unknown.Net&quot;]You could use pagination instead, but you seem like fresh meat on the table to what you are wanting. So best thing would be to get some personal help from someone here to help you reformat things, or.. paying someone. I doubt you&#39;ll pay, so just look for help, like post a script and ask people how to get such and such over on that side and there. Ya you kno what i mean, do you? I hope.[/quote]

If you haven&#39;t picked up on it by now, I want a picture viewer in javascript, which performs as close to this website as possible.  
http://html1.photobiz.com/html_gallery.cfm?menu_itemID=162273&amp;load=html (notice how it has a maximum of 7 thumbnails then provides the next button.  Click on it and see what it does for yourself.  And it open up the thumbnails original sized image to the left when clicked.)

So...

1. Edit the code &amp; script from this URL to include the option to click &quot;next&quot; which loads the rest of the thumbnails.
http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/thumbnail2.htm

2. Edit the code from this URL so that I can specify where to open the image once clicked on.  I want to have a 2 column table and have the thumbnails in one column and when clicked open the large image in the other column.  Or just two 1 column tables on the same page with the thumbs in one and the large images in the other, you get it.
http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/cmotiongallery2.htm

3. Write me a script that shows the images like this site does.  The thumbs on the right side with the &quot;next&quot; &amp; &quot;back&quot; options that loads more thumbs, and the images open up in the table on the right side when clicked.  http://html1.photobiz.com/html_gallery.cfm?menu_itemID=162273&amp;load=html

4. If you can find a free script that already does what I want, please direct me to it lol.

There you have it, 4 options, you choose which one.  Anyone kind/experienced enough to help?</description>

If I had enough rep to rep++ you then I would.  And no I don’t know any JS, just how to implement it into a website lol.  But I’m an intermediate with HTML, and I’ve coded for Runescape with Java and Pascal.  So I know the basics of everything and can figure most of the stuff out when reading JS code.</p>

Well I googled pagination and I can’t tell if it would do what I want or not.  To tell the truth it slightly confuses the hell out of me lol.<br>
And alright re-read my first post and I’ll give you guys some options to what I want.  And you’re right, I don’t want to pay lol.<br>

<p>You could use pagination instead, but you seem like fresh meat on the table to what you are wanting. So best thing would be to get some personal help from someone here to help you reformat things, or… paying someone. I doubt you’ll pay, so just look for help, like post a script and ask people how to get such and such over on that side and there. Ya you kno what i mean, do you? I hope.</p>

<p>If you haven’t picked up on it by now, I want a picture viewer in javascript, which performs as close to this website as possible.<br>
<a href="http://html1.photobiz.com/html_gallery.cfm?menu_itemID=162273&amp;load=html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://html1.photobiz.com/html_gallery.cfm?menu_itemID=162273&amp;load=html</a> (notice how it has a maximum of 7 thumbnails then provides the next button.  Click on it and see what it does for yourself.  And it open up the thumbnails original sized image to the left when clicked.)</p>
<p>So…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Edit the code &amp; script from this URL to include the option to click “next” which loads the rest of the thumbnails.<br>
<a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/thumbnail2.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/thumbnail2.htm</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit the code from this URL so that I can specify where to open the image once clicked on.  I want to have a 2 column table and have the thumbnails in one column and when clicked open the large image in the other column.  Or just two 1 column tables on the same page with the thumbs in one and the large images in the other, you get it.<br>
<a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/cmotiongallery2.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/cmotiongallery2.htm</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write me a script that shows the images like this site does.  The thumbs on the right side with the “next” &amp; “back” options that loads more thumbs, and the images open up in the table on the right side when clicked.  <a href="http://html1.photobiz.com/html_gallery.cfm?menu_itemID=162273&amp;load=html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://html1.photobiz.com/html_gallery.cfm?menu_itemID=162273&amp;load=html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can find a free script that already does what I want, please direct me to it lol.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There you have it, 4 options, you choose which one.  Anyone kind/experienced enough to help?</p>
