    <title>Need Help Getting My Server Up And Running</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-getting-my-server-up-and-running/42844</link>
    <description>EDIT

I download the official PhoneScape source and I will adopt it as my own for KaineScape.

Just 1 problem. I went through and edited compile.bat and runserver.bat and ran them and the runserver is still saying Phonescape. Plus, I have the DUC v2.2.1 (from the no-ip site) running with my host server

kainescape.servebeer.com  &lt;-- I put that in under New Server
43594     &lt;-- I put that in under New Port

I punched in a username and password I wanted and hit the connect button and it gave me the old error message, server may be down, yada yada. I clicked the little smiley face on DUC V.2.2.1 so it&#39;s smiling instead of wearing glasses and tried it, still the error message.

[size=14pt]The only thing I did not do in the guide was the router IP thing as I do not see any &quot;gaming&quot; button and I cannot find my routers IP.[/size]

What am I doing wrong?</description>

<p>I got my router IP and punched it in on internet but it came up as login failed. I got windows xp and I’m under the Owner status. Maybe I have to switch to Administrator?[br][size=1]Posted on: January 02, 2007, 01:47:31 PM[/size][hr]Nevermind, I am an administrator…it is my laptop.</p>
<p>What do I do now? It keeps saying user login failed whenever I try to login to my router…is there a backdoor access method like a program file or something?</p>
