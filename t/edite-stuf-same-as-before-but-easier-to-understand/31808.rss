<p>//------NpcID—CoordX–CoordY–Height–RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2-WalkType-Descrption</p>
<p>npc id = monster or npc id i suggest looking in runelocus for ur monster id u want to put<br>
coordX=the Xcoord of the npc sample=X:3111<br>
coordY=the Ycoord of the npc sampe =X:3111 Y:3042<br>
height=how much will the monster height be i suggest to keep it as default so u dont mess up ur server…<br>
rangeX1/x2/y1/y2=The place of the npc in format range x1 and other… i suggest u keep also default so u dont mess up ur server…<br>
WalkType=how u want the npc to walk 1=a little 2= a bit more 3+= how u want them to move a lot or noy.</p>
<p>sample of one in my autospawn</p>
<p>spawn = 100	3053	3491	0	0	0	0	0	2	goblin</p>
<p>so if u want to change for example ur monster location just change 3053 and 3491 to the Coords of ur monster will be …</p>
