    <description>is it possible to re-generate a certain chunk or set of chunks?

I got bored and experimented with eyes of ender in w1, i stumbled upon the exact location of where a stronghold would be (given the world was generated after 1.1)

I tested this area with the same seed in SSP and it turns out the stronghold would be generated not far at all (800 blocks) from old w1 spawn

It would be cool to regenerate this area and have a stronghold in w1</description>

              <p>Good point. But in w2 the chunks wouldnt change i wouldnt think. As for w1, the amount of people still living in w1 is a very small number.</p>
<p>And for the stronghold chunk, its fortunate that there isnt anything built on top of or really close to it so im positive it wont interfere with anything.</p>

              <p>Don’t know about regenerating specific chunks - even if we did it’d probably cause drama anyway. If you took it for example then everyone would want one generating.</p>
<p>Only if we regenerated the entire map, which has its own set of problems, not least how big W1 is.</p>
