    <description>Hello guys, ive just changed my java in the classpath and path but i forgot to save it was it was before i changed it is there any possible way i can get it back?

and also now ive changed it i can run my server but not my silab client,      i tryed the webclient and it comes up with this,



Error_loader_client - Unable to download client.
silabclient was unable to download the client file 


Login to your computer as an &#39;administator&#39; user, and then try loading silabclient again. This should give it sufficient access to create save client cache file. 


Or, create a new directory called C:\WINDOWS\.silabclient_store_32 or /.silabclient_store_32. If possible, set that directory to have full read+write permissions so that all users can write to it. silabclient should then detect that directory and use it for its files. 


Make sure to accept the java signature it looks like this: 


if the signature does not come up for you, some security software or parental settings may be perventing you from accepting it.
  

and my client on my computer says, 


C:/User/Josh/my received files/client/silab/silabclient&gt;java&gt;xmx521m -jar silabclient. jar 00 highmem members 0 java is not reconginzed as an internal or external command
