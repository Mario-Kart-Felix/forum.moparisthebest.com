    <description>I&#39;m seriously tired of Mopar not listening nor implementing the communitys suggestions.Mopar has reached a level where it needs fixing no,or we can say bye to what it once stood for.

We as a community [b]must[/b] take a stand and get our voices heard.

1. Moparscape is a complete joke,complete hopeless idiots seem to dominate our forum with stupid questions like &quot;How can i connect to servers?&quot;.I say just change Moparscapes name,redirect it and just forget about it.

2.Regs MUST be closed,the influx of morons is getting way to strong and must be stopped.

3.The staff must be looked at again,this is moparisthebest not kaitnieks,the current staff don&#39;t contribute at all and ban whoever challenges them.Well i consider that complete bullshit.We need active staff,that contribute and are from all different timezones so one is always on.

4.Any moron threads must be taken care of by answering and locking.If they need help they can contact us over msn.

5.Suggestions must be heard.Mopar is ignorant as ever and isnt listening to us as a whole.


Thats about all.</description>

<p>Everyone can see this happening, except no one wants to do anything about it. I think that Mopar should make special categories on <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a> for the specific people that do not spam and go to <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> for learning and entertainment. The Categories need to be split on <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a>. <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> and <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a> do need to be split finally. It will prevent the spammers from Moparscape to come over here and destroy Moparisthebest as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terrible move and is probably never going to happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course the staff needs to be looked at. I do like the idea of making moderators of all different time zones, keeping the forums nice and tidy. Sectional Moderators are seeming to take a long time to choose. <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a> is turning into absoulute trash now. Something needs to be done and needs to be done swiftly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the first part is already being done. The second part should be pms because not all of the staff are always on MSN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He does a great job. I will probably keep looking through this topic and see what ideas are best to choose from.</p>

</aside>
<p>It IS Mopar’s forum.  And as far as I can tell it has not changed from “what it once stood for”.  It’s one of the last bastions of ‘real’ RS Cheating still standing against the long night of scam and ignorance.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Agreed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Krichevskoy said, if you close registration you sign the death warrant of the community.  People will lose interest (and have been) and move on with life.  If you close registration who will replace them?  Idiots can always be excised - far harder to replace quality members if they quit and registration is closed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can  you cite any examples of staff acting in that fashion that were not immediately addressed by mopar?  I surf the Community boards and that’s about it anymore, so I’m out of touch with ‘current events’ in the forum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isn’t this being done already?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s also the administrator and is paying for this place out of his own pocket, I believe.  If you were contributing towards the site’s expenses then maybe you would have some room to complain if you felt justified in doing so.  If not, why bellyache?  Just leave if you don’t like it.  Go enjoy the luxuries of <a href="http://Sythe.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Sythe.org</a>.</p>

<p>Closing registration is a bad idea, as Kirchevskoy said. Finding good staffers is extremely difficult, as is answering/locking all the shit threads.

<p>No. In past RS cheating, any community that has closed its registrations and not had some SERIOUS and FOCUSED work going on among its pre-closing members has died. This site does not meet that qualification. After all, clueless newbies aren’t the only people registering - some of the old school cheaters might decide to come back (or even, <em>gasp</em>, a knowledgeable programmer who’s only new to RuneScape), not to mention any educable newbies.</p>

<p>Yes, though if I were on staff I would say private messages instead of MSN.</p>
