    <title>US gets involved with stopping Australia&#39;s Censorship Scheme</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/us-gets-involved-with-stopping-australias-censorship-scheme/336966</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;GOOGLE Australia has voiced its concerns over the Rudd Government&#39;s controversial mandatory ISP filtering plan directly to the US State Department.

One of the internet giant&#39;s biggest worry is the filter&#39;s scope, which it believes to be too broad.

It is understood the matter was raised just over a week ago with representatives from the State Department.

The filter is meant to block content rated Refused Classification (RC) that includes, but is not limited to, child sexual abuse imagery, bestiality, sexual violence, detailed instruction in crime, violence or drug use and material that advocates terrorist acts.

Google and various internet experts believe the RC list could also potentially contain legitimate material.

The revelation comes following a report in The Australian on March 29 that the State Department had raised the filtering issue with Australian government officials.

Communications Minister Stephen Conroy&#39;s spokeswoman this week confirmed that Australian and US officials have discussed ISP filtering.

The US government is against internet censorship -- a view reinforced this week by the country&#39;s ambassador to Australia, Jeff Bleich, who said he believes child pornographers can caught without resorting to mandatory internet filters.

Google Australia&#39;s head of public policy and government affairs, Iarla Flynn, said the company has both privately and publicly aired its views to various parties, including the US State Department.

Mr Flynn could not elaborate on those discussions.

&quot;Our primary concern is the scope of the filter. We think it&#39;s too broad because RC goes well beyond child sexual abuse material and has a whole number of grey areas,&quot; he said.

&quot;For example, it would seek to block material promoting or providing instruction in any crime and that would capture videos showing how to do graffiti ... in certain circumstances graffiti can be a crime, (but filtering) that to us seems excessive.&quot;

Mr Flynn said the boundaries of the proposed filtering were &quot;very vague&quot; and had the potential to go further through scope-creep.

&quot;Euthanasia is a crime, therefore material which talks about or promotes euthanasia can also be captured within the scope of this filter,&quot; he said. &quot;On an issue like euthanasia -- which is politically and socially controversial -- we think governments should be very, very slow to be blocking access to information on a subject like that.&quot;

Online free speech advocate Irene Graham has said that RC includes material deemed to &quot;offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults&quot;.

The depiction of actual sexual activity between consenting adults involving lawful fetishes could also be classified as RC content and blocked by the filter.

The Classification Board decides what publications, films and computer games can be sold in Australia; there is no category for the internet.

State and federal attorney&#39;s-general decide on the guidelines for RC markings based on &quot;community standards&quot;.

Senator Conroy has maintained that ISP filtering is one of many weapons in the government&#39;s cyber-safety armada.

His spokeswoman could not say if the minister agreed or disagreed with the US Ambassador&#39;s comments, but she reiterated the government&#39;s stance: it does not support RC content being available on the internet.

&quot;RC material is already prohibited on Australian websites,&quot; she said.

&quot;Under Australia’s existing Classification regulations this material is not available in newsagencies, it is not on library shelves, you cannot watch it on a DVD or at the cinema, and it is not shown on television.

&quot;As we have consistently said, ISP-level filtering is just one part of the government’s $125.8 million cyber-safety policy, which also includes education, research and international cooperation. Importantly, the policy (provides) $49m for law enforcement by providing 91 additional Australian Federal Police officers to the Child Protection Unit.&quot;

Under the government&#39;s policy, RC material hosted here or overseas would be added to the filtering blacklist based on a public complaint to the Australian Communications and Media Authority.

&quot;The policy does not apply to X18+ material and no material other than RC-content will be blocked,&quot; she said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

TL;DR: Australian government is trying to censor the internet, and the US government has started to apply pressure to stop it.

Firstly, I&#39;d like to thank the US government. Australia clearly isn&#39;t above abuses of power by its government -- hell, we haven&#39;t even heard of &#39;rights&#39; down here when it comes to things like freedom of speech and the freedom to self determination. 
So thank you for getting involved.

Secondly, I can&#39;t believe that this shit is still going on. Most Australians take [b]everything[/b] sitting down, are completely undereducated when it comes to things like this, and have no desire to change either of these two traits. What a fucking joke.</description>

<p>Nobody is arguing for <span class="bbcode-i">absolute</span> freedom, we are only arguing for enough freedom so that we can live in a democratic society.</p>
<p>Moparisthebest couldn’t you argue that every democratically elected government fears its people because they might lose the next election. All it needs to work is a well-educated and sceptical-minded population capable of making an informed vote.<br>
I understand Australia has forced voting, so you get many people making <span class="bbcode-i">uninformed</span> votes to avoid the fine. Perhaps this is the source of Australian dictatorship?</p>

              <p>I disagree with speljohan when he says no country is truly free, any country that has the right to own and use weapons by a constitutional amendment must remain truly free by definition.  This is because the government would never do anything so oppressing or unfair to cause the people to revolt, overthrow the current government, and replace it with a new one.  Governments like Australia however don’t have this fear, as a bunch of people without guns aren’t anything to fear against your well armed army and body guards.  As far as I’m aware, only the USA has this right as a constitutional amendment, which I would say makes it deserve the title of ‘the leader of the free world’.  Of course correct me if I’m wrong and another country has this right.</p>

<p>The term Free World is a politically-charged propaganda term that was used during the Cold War to refer to the Western Bloc. Even more broadly, it was used to refer to all non-communist countries.

<blockquote>The Leader of the Free World is a colloquialism, originally used during the Cold War, to describe the president of the United States. The term implies that the United States president as leader of the principal democratic superpower of the time was, by extension, the leader of all of the world's democratic nations. Although it had a Cold War origin, it is still being used in America to describe the United States president today.[1] [b]In addition, the term is sometimes used satirically when either the United States or its president engages in behavior that other nations disagree with or disapprove of or vice versa[/b].</blockquote>

              <p>Jesus Speljohan, we NEED some good ol’ fashioned US policy here when it comes to freedom of the internet.</p>
<p>Take a hint: most internet users in Australia don’t want their internet censored by a government that maintains a secret blacklist (which means no way of knowing what’s being censored, no means to appeal because nobody can confirm or deny a URL’s presence on the list, etc).<br>
Those that didn’t like the US getting involved had that opinion because they were either arrogant or too proud. There’s nothing wrong with needing a helping hand when you can’t do something yourself, and if it takes some redneck from Kentucky to put our government straight then so be it.</p>

<p>If shit were to hit the fan in China and the citizens banded together and asked what gives the government the right to censor their internet, the Chinese government will merely point at Australia and say “filtering internet is all the rage – they even do it in democratic countries now”.
