    <title>Looking For Website Developer(s)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-website-developer-s/441462</link>
    <description>Well recently my friend and I have started on a new rsps. We decided that we didn&#39;t want to make a free website so we went ahead and are buying a domain for $7.48 per month. The problem is, neither of us know what we are doing with it. There are Automatic Website Builders in the control panel but there pretty confusing. Were currently using a domain from &quot;http://www.hosting24.com/&quot;. 

This is all i got so far :
http://www.optimusx.net/

If Anybody can help us, they will be guaranteed a staff spot on our server.</description>

              <p>I didn’t mean to name steal? i was watching transformers and thinking of a name at the same time and i was like, “hey why not OptimusX” cause the word “optimus” means the best. Probably just a coincidence.</p>
