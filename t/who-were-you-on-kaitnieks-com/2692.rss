I was pyro 910. Only because i either think Pyro was taken Or that i thought pyro was taken so just went with one that wouldnt have been taken. Most people dont remember me. But if you look in your scripts folder and find one of the only workign ess miners out there. It will have my name at the top<br>

<p>I remember that script.[/quote]</p>
<p>ahhh what a noobie piece of work it was looking back on it now. Lol i didnt even know booleans so i just used strings with the words. ‘ok’ or ‘no’. all i wanted to do was just get it out there without knowing full scar or anything. And suprisingly it actually worked.</p>

<p>Tried scripting Scar. Gave Up. Made one Aryan script, my chicken killer with banking. I remember it was put in a giant script pack &lt;3 I was so honoured, other than that i was just a genral leecher although i did help a lot with people on the Aryan forums. By god do i miss that site, everyone was so friendly and it was always a laugh. Glad to see many of the greats still visit here. I believe i was in the rank of 32,00th odd for my first account but i cant remmeber the name, old pker, got banned. Heh, and to think i admired Sexrex, pffft. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
