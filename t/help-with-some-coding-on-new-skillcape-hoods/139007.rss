    <description>before you go saying that I don&#39;t have it in the right place in item.java, go home. If you notice when you fix the hoods and put them so your hair doesn&#39;t show it affects the characters jaw, the reason this is happening is because when you either put the hood in fullmask or full helm, it interprets that the hood should cover your whole face and is not showing the jaw. There has been many global object issues like this in the past, please help, I&#39;m no good at global objects and if you can help I would like to ask permission to post this as a tutorial to help others ( you will receive full credit)</description>

              <p>Have you added the hoods ID to both mask and helm? or just one because that may be the problem.People told me i had to add it to both when i tried to fix that ^^</p>
