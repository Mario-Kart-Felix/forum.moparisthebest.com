    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs-2006-remake-the-good-old-times/403406</link>
    <description>okay so everyone is probably like, woo another runescape remake that will not make it, but the differnce between us, is we take certain coaders and place them in a certain area, so lets say for example you apply and get the job, well then we will put you in a area, for example, lumbridge, now you are responsible to making that area exatly like it was in 2006, including monsters, and shops and what not.

now i know many people are going to say what about media, but i have none yet we are still in the research stage, but we do have a blank client and source that we are using, so far we are currently looking for the prices of all the items that they use to be, here is our list (in the post below because it exceeds the maximum number of characters)
