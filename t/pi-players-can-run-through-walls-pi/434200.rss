    <title>[PI] Players can run through walls? [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-players-can-run-through-walls-pi/434200</link>
    <description>Hello, I have a PI source that I&#39;m messing around with and I&#39;m wondering if anybody can help me solve this problem. The source is pretty much done except that when a player attacks a monster or player, it will allow the player to run through anything in his/her way until they finally attack the monster or player. Is there a way to make it so they still have to run around obstacles in their way to attack?

Any help is appreciated.</description>
