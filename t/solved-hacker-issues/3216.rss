    <title>[SOLVED] Hacker issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solved-hacker-issues/3216</link>
    <description>Edit: PROBLEM IS RESOLVED! THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR HELPING. No one really did, but lol I fixed the problem. Turns out there was a number of services, but anyways.... Please don&#39;t bother posting, I&#39;m done with this. Had to repeat myself 3 times, the issue has been solved. Thanks. 

Note: My ISP wasn&#39;t doing scans. It was a virus. I&#39;m not hacking don&#39;t worry, even though I really wanted to lol. I called my ISP and they didn&#39;t do anything.

Hey. How do I fuck over a hacker?

This hacker, who&#39;s IP is 70.27.220.34, keeps &#39;trying&#39; to hack my fucking computer. He&#39;s not getting in, but he&#39;s tried 3 times and is annoying the hell out of me. 

I really want to piss him off. Can someone show me how to DDOS or Hack into his computer and delete his fucking hardrive. I HATE HACKERS. I wanna just punch him right in the face and knock his nerdy glasses off his ugly face.

Please dont give me a link to &quot;just fucking google it&quot;, because I&#39;ve been to enough hack sites where I automatically get pinged 20 times a second or get a virus or whatever.

Call your ISP.  They’ll contact his.<br>

<p>Best idea here, this’ll be fast and all the other ideas will just get you in trouble and you’ll be as bad as the hacker.[/quote]<br>
The other plus side to this is that, if the offence is great enough, you may get some money in damages <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Like I said before, contacting my ISP didn’t do shit. But I found out that when I open BitTorrent, someone is looking at all the IP addresses connected to them, and is using the program to obtain people’s IPs and then hacking them or at least trying to, through BitTorrent.</p>
<p>What I did was completely disable TCP incomming, I think. I disabled a lot of shares on my computer and a bunch of services from services.msc that contributed.</p>
<p>Now even if the guy gets through using TCP, it will bounce off the computer. Yay.</p>

<p>You’re right. The ISP didn’t do anything about it. Ugh… If they did , they woudl be getting millions of calls a day lol. Or at elast 1000s.</p>

<p>Either way, why are you getting attacked? Get zone alarm, or sygate or something… Maybe you have a trojan on your computer? Try scanning your computer and all that stuff…[/quote]<br>
Ihave 3 firewalls like I mentioned above… including a software firewall. Though you still get “attacked”, that’s the purpose of the firewall, to block attacks lol.</p>
<p>The reason I’m getting attacked is that some moron who wants to get credit card information is trying to get into other people’s computers. That’s 99% of the reason anyone gets hacked nowdays. I can’t wait until web 2.0 comes out and we get some very secure protocols, so secure, hacking would be ‘nearly’ and/or supposedly impossible.</p>
<p>I was hoping there was a hacker on this forum, who could just bother the guy that hacked me, but I geuss not lol. Oh well, He’s gone now. It just bothered me that he got through 2/3 firewalls.</p>
<p>No keyloggers/viruses were installed on my computer, except for when I downloaded a hack like an idiot. I shouldn’t have lol, wasn’t smart.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help.</p>

<p>Yeah, 90% of the proxy owners either dont give a hell, or dont keep logs. And the ones that do you wont get a hold of them in less than two weeks. Never seen anyone get caught who was using a proxy chain. So yeah, you can try talking to some dude in canada, who will direct you to an ip in Romania who most likely wont speak english. And after you’ve wasted your life for a couple of days you can go cut yourself.</p>

<p>Either way, why are you getting attacked? Get zone alarm, or sygate or something… Maybe you have a trojan on your computer? Try scanning your computer and all that stuff…</p>

<p>Note: My ISP wasn’t doing scans. It was a virus. I’m not hacking don’t worry, even though I really wanted to lol. I called my ISP and they didn’t do anything.</p>
<p>Hey. How do I fuck over a hacker?</p>
<p>This hacker, who’s IP is 70.27.220.34, keeps ‘trying’ to hack my fucking computer. He’s not getting in, but he’s tried 3 times and is annoying the hell out of me.</p>
<p>I really want to piss him off. Can someone show me how to DDOS or Hack into his computer and delete his fucking hardrive. I HATE HACKERS. I wanna just punch him right in the face and knock his nerdy glasses off his ugly face.</p>
<p>Please dont give me a link to “just fucking google it”, because I’ve been to enough hack sites where I automatically get pinged 20 times a second or get a virus or whatever.</p>
