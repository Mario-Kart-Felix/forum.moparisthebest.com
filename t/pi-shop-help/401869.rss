    <title>[PI] Shop Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-shop-help/401869</link>
    <description>Hey, I am running a server that is a PI and am having a problem. Everytime I add shops they are there and all but when I a buy from them it doesn&#39;t work. Than, I click value, and it says this item costs 0 points. It is not pk points or any other form of points in the server. This is driving me crazy!!!!  :mad: I was hoping one of you can help me as it causes lots of problems and I cannot add shops so people cant recieve basic items such as iron scimmy. :(

If anybody can help please reply ASAP. My server with the problem is online and you will be treated well on it if you can help me fix this problem. Thanks!</description>
