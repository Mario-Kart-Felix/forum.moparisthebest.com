    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-hoster/197691</link>
    <description>Unfortunatley, I am not going to be able to support the abbysalscape server soon so I am looking for a trustworthy hoster, but note, you will not be able to code I will give you a file with the abbysalscape CLASS files, and a runserver file, wich will still enable you to host. However, You will have access to people&#39;s accounts. YOU MUST BE A SENIOR MEMBER! this is for security. and you must also be able to host a server almost 24/7. please reply soon.
