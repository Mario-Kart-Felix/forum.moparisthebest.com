We’ve been giving loads of stuff to Africa for a long time now, including laptops. And we also help the treatment of aids there.[/quote]<br>

<p>I don’t know, maybe the government thinks we’d rather know these stats in currency rather than 10,294 bottles of water and 5,235 egg sandwiches. As you say though, they probably just did it to show off how much money they’ve spent rather than the help they’re giving.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason is, they didn’t just fly over to Haiti and dump $100m on their doorstep.</p>

I love how the US is putting 10,000 troops there, just getting ready to intorduce a 51st state.</p>

<p>Troops are there to stop rioting and if you seen any videos you know how hectic it is over there<br>
they also sent a fleet of many medics. It actually looks like the USA is the only who cares or at<br>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/unhandled">@unhandled</a> you really think the current war is about oil?[/quote]<br>
If you wish to level roots with these aspects of the US war then perhaps consider why there are <span class="bbcode-i">riots</span>?<br>
USA’s presence is not taken lightly by the people of Afghanistan. Hence they riot until they will get what they want. I truly feel for Afghanistan, it’s a nation that’s been torn by 2 powerful nations only for their personal gain. Leave Afghanistan and the Middle East and see how these “acts of terrorism” decrease. The image of Islam has been tainted by mediocre minds of Americans who do not quite understand concepts and facts.</p>
