    <description>Hello moparscape, 

Ive been trying to create a webclient lately but im having trouble
i know how code pretty well but ive never coded a client im only experinced with the source
i tried making the webclient with both client and Gui (and yes i made sure that there were undercase and uppercase letters).


The real problem is i keeping getting an error on my website it says exeption: cannot find main class: client
and the same thing goes when i tryed the Gui it says execption cannot find Gui

i tryed deleting all my class files and then compile then make the jar and post it on website but still same thing....

Can anyone Please help?

Thank you and sorry for spelling mistakes
please comment how i can fix or pm me please!

<p>Did you specify the correct folder containing the .class files when jarring? And are you sure your main client manifest is client or gui?</p>

</aside>
<p>yes I entered the correct folder and yes the main class client /Gui is correct there is no other class file in the client that could be it</p>
