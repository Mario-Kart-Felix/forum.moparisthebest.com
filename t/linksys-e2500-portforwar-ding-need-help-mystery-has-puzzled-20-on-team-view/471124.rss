    <title>Linksys E2500 Portforwar​ding - Need Help - Mystery has puzzled 20+ On Team View</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/linksys-e2500-portforwar-ding-need-help-mystery-has-puzzled-20-on-team-view/471124</link>
    <description>I am having a bit of trouble and am looking for the help of any expert. I have been everywhere, called everyone, and team viewed with many people. No one can seem to figure out my problem. I am trying to portforward ports for online gaming.

 
•The two particular ones are runescape private servers, port 43594, and minecraft, port 25565.
•I have a linksys e2500 router
•I am currently with S&amp;T telecommunications for my internet service. I have called them to see if they block any protocols or ports by default. They sounded pretty clueless but assured me that they do not.
•My OS is Windows 7

 

I have followed portforwarding tutorials on how to forward these ports, followed tutorials on how to add exceptions into my Windows 7 firewall, and so on. I have pretty much exhausted all options. I have went to canyouseeme and every time I get the error code &quot;Reason, Connection timed out&quot;

If anyone has any new ideas or would like to aid in figuring out this mystery which has stumped me and many others, feel free to give it a shot 

 

Thank You</description>

<p>you can try using simpleportforwarding. It’s a tool that does the “dirty work” for you. I personally use it. it can be found <a href="http://www.simpleportforwarding.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. Just download, install. Run. change the router to yours, enter the router login info. Set a custom port. Run. Then use the built in port checker (in tools menu) to see if it worked. Also, don’t forget to check your firewall settings.</p>
<p>Need any help with it? ask.</p>
