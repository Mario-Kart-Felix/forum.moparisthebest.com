              <p>I am with sk8rdude. I played for 4 hours. DO NOT PLAY THIS SERVER!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>constant roll backs (maybe 3 times an hour) There is a chance you will lose items and skills. I lost (50m, dh axe, dh helm, dragon chain, dragon helm, 2 whips, and dragon gauntles) I reported all of the cases to owner “Beale” and he will not help because it did not happen to everyone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attack animations and death animations are horrible. Looks like you are fighting blobs and it is just hideous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eco is horrible. In V1 of Wrathscape you got a 15m starter. Now it is 50m. And alot of the monsters drop 1m cash each drop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay2Win and Vote2Win, Beale spams all the time to donate 10, 15, 25$ for donating ranks. Or you can donate 10$ for your own private house… It is literally non stop and annoying. Why would we donator when you do not help players and you act like a jerk to everyone?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugs, Tons of bugs you get stuck all of the time (especially in slayer tower).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bosses are to OP, Most of the bosses 1 hit you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is exactly what Moparscape User “Tree” posted in his video review about it. All that is changed is a few areas are different and home and stuff. But all the negatives are still the same and have not been fixed or edited. Only have gotten worse. (Especially the 50m starter and 1m constant drops from killing goblins)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I beg to anyone who is reading this… DO NOT PLAY THIS SERVER! He is just after the money.</p>
<p>Here is trees video review from version 1. Trust me guys… Version 2 is not better!</p>
<p>If you are going to play, atleast wait til he comes out with Wrathscape V150, he does very little to each version he comes out with. So it <span class="bbcode-b">might</span> be fun by version 150.</p>
<p>P.S (To Beale) 2 of your beta testers told me while you were afk that they were quitting ( because you lied to them about there accounts or something?) They told me to let you know they were done.</p>

This is exactly the kind of cancerous people that infected the rsps community and now we’ve ended up with this big piece of shit we got today. I used to log into mopar and see atleast 3 servers worth logging into, because people actually put time and effort into their creations. Sk8r let you off easy, and provided intelligent constructive criticism. What he really should of told you is that your “server” is a complete piece of shit, and a waste of time for you and everyone that would join it. It just makes me think, seriously like what the fück do you people even think anymore while posting this garbage…</li>

You see, that’s the exact reason why I don’t help you.</li>

<p>Why should I even think to help a person that’s going to act like that? Explain that to me.<br>
Exactly. You can’t.<br>

Yes, I’m a server helper. That badge really has no meaning outside of the “Server Help” section. Hence it’s name.</p>
<p>And, I’d like to point out that I’ve helped plenty of people in the <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,48.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Server Help</a> section (A lot more than you have, too). Again, which is why I got the badge.</p>
<p>I’m allowed to be a human being, and talk freely. There is no rules or stipulations that came with the badge (And if there were, I sure as hell wasn’t informed).<br>

<p>You posted an advertisement on the website, I gave an honest reply. It’s your choice to do whatever with it. However, how you responded shows that you won’t be a very fit owner. And I’m glad I stopped playing.[/quote]</p>
<p>Sk8r has helped a ton of people, doesn’t mean he has to; the badge doesn’t obligate him to automatically help everyone, especially if they’re complete morons. He gave you constructive criticism and you’re acting like a little shit (scary to imagine how that reflects upon you as a server owner.) Nice review, btw. <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,669619.0/topicseen.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,669619.0/topicseen.html</a> Hopefully you take some notes from that video and strive for improvement, but I doubt it.</p>

<li>
<p>The first image on your homepage is a donator shop. Obviously you guys really, really want donations.<br>
You shouldn’t even be promoting that. Promote donations as a whole, not just 1 (EXTREMELY UNFAIR) feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client has an error when downloading the cache. It fails to check some url, and then downloads from another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no “challenge” in the server as everything is provided in shops. Dragon? Yep. Frost dragon bones? Yep. Slayer charms? Yep. Supplies needed to get 99 in skills? Yep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fading hitmarks have black boxes around them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your combat is terrible. If I hit npcs right, they don’t retaliate.</p>

<li>
<p>NPCs can walk through walls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where is the economy? There needs to be ways to make money <span class="bbcode-u">other</span> than just skilling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server is beyond laggy.</p>

<li>
<p>There’s sooooooooo many bugs.</p>

The whole staff thing is situated as of now and we are proceeding to add tons of stuff to make this server even better. sorry for any inconvenience as far as everything goes but thank you for the feedback. expect to see you playing soon.<br>

              <p>Server review:</p>
<p>Server itself is ok, eco is a bit wacky. Its super easy to get gold, which makes the economy virtually nonexistent. Multiple bugs here and there. My account is permanently muted and they can’t figure out how to undo it. Server accounts were all reset a week or two after I joined due to a staff member abusing power. Everyone else was punished because of it and unfortunately a handful of players quit. My only complaint is the way things are done here. Only staff member that has a decent idea on how to run things is the guy posting this thread, Paul. I feel the staff is a bit to tense with bans, mutes, and jail. They take offense to many things here, which is silly. That’s their choice. Server could be good if the owners took time to decide who should be on staff, instead of resetting and making brand new players a part of the staff. I may not know the whole story, but this is my experience.</p>
