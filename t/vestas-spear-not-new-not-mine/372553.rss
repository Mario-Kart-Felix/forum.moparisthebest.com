I’ll let it be if you can show me some intelligence. Right now you in my eyes you look like someone who knows nothing about animation, or even say modeling, and you leeched someone else work of putting a Vesta’s spear into a client, hoping that people would say THANKS I WANTED THIS. Well those people who are too lazy to use the search button don’t deserve this.[/quote]<br>
This. I’d prefer if stuff like this was posted in client hacking. This section is for models NOT MADE BY JAGEX. We’ve been lucky to have not seen a skillcape in weeks. But unless you have a homemade model, please don’t post here. I wanna see if I can get a mod like CJ to approve this.</p>
