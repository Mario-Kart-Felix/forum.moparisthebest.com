    <description>guys blackworm had dissabled MD5 password hashing on his server and checking for true strings he has hacked multiple msns i urge you if you were at all affliated with runevortex to change ALL of your passwords RS or not if you dont belive me i had to run a restore of my msn list from 2 months ago i will have a newer one restored in a week or so.

plesae if you were at all asscociated with RV change your passwords if anyone here needs proof ill post a screen shot of a convorsation with Dark night about this this is not old news and the sit he is redirecting to he still owns its just a different site not for RS cheating thanks to curt he no longer has his files to browse through and he hopefully dosent have a back up.
