    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shutting-down-computers-on-a-network-winxp/105882</link>
    <description>To shut down computers on any network, you just need access to the command prompt and an account with admin privileges, or the ablility to run programs as an admin. 

1. Go to Start - Accessories - Command Prompt. Right-click and select Run As

2. Type in an admin username and password (skip this if your account is an admin account)

3. In the command prompt screen, type shutdown -i 

4. This brings up a dialog that lets you shut down any computer on the network, as long as you know its name!</description>

<p>Nah, I ain’t worried about the credit. It pisses me off when I have to keep spamming shutdown -a to the command prompt all the time…</p>

              <p>Well, the thing is, I only found out because our school’s default student account (for students who don’t have an account or whose account is broken), is an <em>admin</em> account! So I found that whenever I need admin privileges, all I have to do is log into it. Not smart, not smart.</p>
