    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/your-worst-hardware-disaster/368530</link>
    <description>Post them here, kgo.

My worst is I accidentally tried to boot a computer with a stick of ram in the wrong way, there was two notches on the stick and somehow thought I got it in because the latch went in - turns out those sticks had two notches and one end was half sticking out. Not that bad really, but I am pretty damn orsm.

The worst thing that&#39;s happened that wasn&#39;t my fault was when a cockroach crawled into the psu and blew up - smelled pretty bad.</description>

I once tried to install XP on my Vista machine, with dualboot. (You know why.) Then the computer froze in the middle of the partitioning prosess. I restarted it, but didn’t get past the BIOS.

I have no idea how it really happened. It just froze in the middle of the process. And the BIOS wouldn’t format the drive either.</p>

              <p>I accidentally scratched some thermal paste off my cpu and it was idling at like 80C. Not much of a disaster since I reapplied some more and screwed the fan on 9999 tight; afterwards all was fine.</p>
<p>Not computer related, but one time I was really bored so I thought it would be a great idea to get my guitar cable: connect one end to output and the other in input of my amp. This resulted in the amp to simply stop working however it was relatively new so I brought it back to the shop and gave me a better amp as a replacement <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>[quote=“bootnecklad, post:11, topic:368530”]I have a couple. I shall add to this post when I think of more.</p>
<p>Was carrying up a HDD up the stairs once, Remember kids: Don’t run up the stairs. A nano-second later after starting to rush the HDD slipped out my hand and fell half way down the stairs, my head went down and my back become hunched every time I heard and felt the thump of it bouncing off the stair… Turns out it worked fine. Weird thing is, its a 15 year old HDD. Go knows what its been through before I touched it.</p>
<p>A while back I was disassembling one of these: <a href="http://www.retroisle.com/amstrad/pcw/Pictures/images_pcw/PCW9512/PCW.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.retroisle.com/amstrad/pcw/Pictures/images_pcw/PCW9512/PCW.jpg</a></p>
<p>I was taking the CRT downstairs, but it was just the tube, the stairs wasnt the problem this time! It almost slipped out hands three times but once I got to the back door, I opened the door and knocked the gun and then shit myself as I heard this loud hissing, practically threw it out the back door and slammed the back door waiting for it to explode/implode… That scared the FUCK out of me, the sudden HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS…[/quote]</p>
<p>I have an old 40 gig hard disk that says ‘warranty void if exposed to shocks in excess of 350 gs’</p>

              <p>The only ‘disaster’ I remember was when I bought a new phone. I had a memory card that I bought with my previous phone, and decided that it would fit in my new one. So without thinking about it I put the card in my new phone. I was surprised when I found out that it was too small.</p>

              <p>I have two that I remember. Once when I was little, spilled coke all over my laptop, started smoking. I got a new, improved one for free from HP though.<br>
The other was when I had a ATi Radeon HD 2400 Pro. I only had a CRT monitor, but I had gotten a vr920 to try it out. It was pretty cool, I was playing fs9 and I told my dad to try it out. As he was flying I was plugging the CRT in to fly while he watches through the HMD. Bad idea. He got shocked, the graphics card got fried, and the magnets within the VR920 that enable headtracking to work got fucked. Luckily I was able to return the HMD (I pretty much planned that anyways, it was cool but <em>way</em> too expensive) + get a new graphics card free due to warranty.</p>

              <p>Not really computer hardware but I bought a headphone amp and the twats who sent it gave me the wrong plug size which I didn’t realise until I was about to plug it in. A few blue arks etc, slight burning smell.</p>
<p>Other than that the only other hardware damage would be while I was trying to unplug a sata cable, it was one of those crappy $0.10 china cables with the button you have to press down to release(which don’t release at all), yanked the bloody plastic bit to hold the cable off the motherboard. Mobo boots slower but other than that no damage.</p>
