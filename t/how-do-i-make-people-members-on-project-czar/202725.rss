              <p>You Should Be Able to do this by typing, ::makemem(username)</p>
<p>If you are a retard for an example you would type<br>
::makememretard</p>
<p>Then Kick Yourself Twice.</p>
<p>If you want to edit the command…</p>
<p>Go to your server, then open the file client.java in notepad…</p>
<p>CTRL + F Then find something like…ifcommandstartswith(makemem);</p>
<p>edit the makemem to w.e and umm yeh save…compile…restart…works…</p>
<p>Np?</p>
