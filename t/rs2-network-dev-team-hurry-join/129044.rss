              <p>wow i finally found one of ur posts reaper i checked pms and it said error board removed so i found this one so ill post here and tomorrow when i wake up all add it to that freewebs site <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><code>User: Juvenile
First Name: Shaunn
Age: 16 very close to 17
Position: server tester
Why: i play games alot and would like to help test
Experience I have: i build servers for runescape and knight online (private servers) and i think its fun to code them so now i will just have fun playing games instead.
Example: my knight online server (JVKO), i coded for my friends Knight online server (Vko) and i have done many other knight online servers on my own that i shut down JVKO was my most recent and it ended up going down until i get about 100$ usd to bring it back up with new database and client
More Proof (optional):
Other that will help me get picked: as said before i want to take time away from coding on knight online servers and playing knight online servers and try something new.
How much time can I spend a day: 6+ hours
Country I live in: USA</code></p>
