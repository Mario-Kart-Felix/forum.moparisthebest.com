    <description>The following is aimed at the staff.
[code]Staff – If this is breaking the no illegal program rules please allow me to find a free compiler.[/code]


This is a tutorial on how to compile your code into a executable file, (.exe). I&#39;ve noticed a fair few people have been asking me how to, so I thought I would make a tutorial on how to; this is a pictured tutorial with everything pretty much explain. I will provide a sample code if you want to try this tutorial. Now, to get started, we will need a type of compiler; and that compiler is called a “Native Compiler”. There programs of these compilers differentiate, and a lot of these programs need to be paid for, so I will supply a program. The program I will supply is called NativeJ. It has a relevant name don&#39;t you think? Below is the download link.

&lt;blockquote&gt;http://rapidshare.com/files/43480571/natja_home.rar&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#39;t think I need to run on about how to install it. Now we need to run the program, so click your installed program, and you should come to a main page and a new project wizard. It will look similar to the following picture.
[IMG]http://img201.imageshack.us/img201/2688/nativejrunwd8.png[/img]

As you can see, it is asking for us to specify a project name. If you click browse, it will asking where you would like to save your project. I like to make a folder on my desktop with the name of the project and do all my project work in there. It makes it a lot better then having the files all over the place. So, go ahead and specify your project directory. Then, click next. Simple right? After you have clicked next, you should see something like the picture below.
[IMG]http://img518.imageshack.us/img518/5267/next1ck8.png[/img]

Now, you can probably gather, it is asking you to specify the name of your executable file which will be created. Note: Make sure you leave the “.exe” part at the end. Of course, with out the quotation marks. So, say I wanted my file which is created called “Program”, in that field, I would supply an answer of “Program.exe”. If you&#39;re happy with your executable file name, click next. Remember, you can make last minute changes. After clicking next, you should see a picture like the following.
[IMG]http://img402.imageshack.us/img402/794/iconpartlw3.png[/img]

If you have realized, or is you haven&#39;t, it is asking us to supply the wizard with the icon that will be used on our executable file which is created. If you don&#39;t supply a icon, it creates the default icon. I like the default icon, it looks like the picture below.
[IMG]http://img181.imageshack.us/img181/4666/deficonwr7.png[/img]
I don&#39;t mind the look of it. But, if you wish to change to your perference, go ahead. Now if you&#39;re happy with your icon to be used, press next. And you should see the next frame, looking something like:
[img]http://img504.imageshack.us/img504/3489/next2ad2.png[/img]

As you can probably gather, it is asking us to supply our main-class of our application. You should know what a main-class is, but, if you don&#39;t, it is the text after your class line. Example:
public class Main {..
In this case, Main would be our main-class. Get it now? So if you enter in your main-class into the wizard and press next, you should come across a new screen. It should look similar to the following picture.
[IMG]http://img516.imageshack.us/img516/4970/next3eu1.png[/img]

Now, if can read or see, you&#39;ll notice that the wizard is asking whether our program is a Console Application or a Graphical Application. If you are unsure on what yours is, it is basically.
[b]Console Application[/b] – A application that works with your console. It usually is the applications that use System.out.println and does not use a Graphical User Interface(GUI). A simple console application looks similar to the following:
[code]public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(“Hello World”);
	}
}[/code]
Notice how it prints the line inside a console program?

[b]Graphical Application[/b] – An application that uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It usually uses the swing or the AWT package. A simple Graphical Application looks similar to the following:
[code]import javax.swing.*;        

public class HelloWorldSwing {

    private static void createAndShowGUI() {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;HelloWorldSwing&quot;);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

        JLabel label = new JLabel(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
        frame.getContentPane().add(label);

        frame.pack();
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                createAndShowGUI();
            }
        });
    }
}[/code]
You may notice it imports the swing package. The other optional package is AWT.
So, if you have decided what yours is, click next, and you should see a frame similar to the picture found below.
[img]http://img168.imageshack.us/img168/6466/next4dq2.png[/img]

What that is, is it&#39;s asking us to supply the wizard a jar file. So, you&#39;ll need to jar your program, and add it too the list, by clicking add + in the wizard. So once you&#39;ve supplied your jar file to the wizard, click next and you should see a frame like the following picture:
[img]http://img128.imageshack.us/img128/6281/next5ow9.png[/img]

What that is saying, is that you have completed the wizard, and you are now ready to compile your code natively. So, click finish, and you should come to the main screen. It will look the following picture.
[img]http://img55.imageshack.us/img55/4529/next6dr5.png[/img]

This is the place where you are able to make your last finishing touches, or edit a few things. Why they have the whole wizard I&#39;ll never know. But, if you&#39;re happy how your settings are, click Generate Executable, it can be located up near the top. Or, in easy terms, look at the picture below.
[img]http://img441.imageshack.us/img441/1633/next7td8.png[/img]

When you click Generate Executable, a new window will open up. It will look something like this if it was successful. 
[img]http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/3743/next8mj3.png[/img]
Otherwise, you stuffed up somewhere.

Sorry if this seems a nooby tutorial, but I merely created it out of boredness, and to help people who want to create .exe files with their programs, instead of jars. And please, don&#39;t flame me. Because simply, I do not care. I&#39;d like too see people start posting tutorials in Java Programming a bit more, instead of the craze with the progress of  “Java Games”. I might be the only one who wants too see more tutorials and more activity in the Java section. So, here I am, out on the field. Who&#39;s with me?

Regards,
#38.</description>

<p>Now, you can probably gather, it is asking you to specify the name of your executable file which will be created. Note: Make sure you leave the “.exe” part at the end. Of course, with out the quotation marks. So, say I wanted my file which is created called “Program”, in that field, I would supply an answer of “Program.exe”. If you’re happy with your executable file name, click next. Remember, you can make last minute changes. After clicking next, you should see a picture like the following.<br>
<img src="http://img402.imageshack.us/img402/794/iconpartlw3.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>If you have realized, or is you haven’t, it is asking us to supply the wizard with the icon that will be used on our executable file which is created. If you don’t supply a icon, it creates the default icon. I like the default icon, it looks like the picture below.<br>
<img src="http://img181.imageshack.us/img181/4666/deficonwr7.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
I don’t mind the look of it. But, if you wish to change to your perference, go ahead. Now if you’re happy with your icon to be used, press next. And you should see the next frame, looking something like:<br>
<img src="http://img504.imageshack.us/img504/3489/next2ad2.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>As you can probably gather, it is asking us to supply our main-class of our application. You should know what a main-class is, but, if you don’t, it is the text after your class line. Example:<br>
public class Main {…<br>
In this case, Main would be our main-class. Get it now? So if you enter in your main-class into the wizard and press next, you should come across a new screen. It should look similar to the following picture.<br>
<img src="http://img516.imageshack.us/img516/4970/next3eu1.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Now, if can read or see, you’ll notice that the wizard is asking whether our program is a Console Application or a Graphical Application. If you are unsure on what yours is, it is basically.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Console Application</span> – A application that works with your console. It usually is the applications that use System.out.println and does not use a Graphical User Interface(GUI). A simple console application looks similar to the following:</p>
<p><code>public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(“Hello World”);
	}
}</code><br>
Notice how it prints the line inside a console program?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Graphical Application</span> – An application that uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It usually uses the swing or the AWT package. A simple Graphical Application looks similar to the following:</p>
<p>[code]import javax.swing.*;</p>
<p>public class HelloWorldSwing {</p>
<pre><code>private static void createAndShowGUI() {
    JFrame frame = new JFrame("HelloWorldSwing");
    frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

    JLabel label = new JLabel("Hello World");
    frame.getContentPane().add(label);

    frame.pack();
    frame.setVisible(true);
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            createAndShowGUI();
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]<br>
You may notice it imports the swing package. The other optional package is AWT.<br>
So, if you have decided what yours is, click next, and you should see a frame similar to the picture found below.<br>
<img src="http://img168.imageshack.us/img168/6466/next4dq2.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>What that is, is it’s asking us to supply the wizard a jar file. So, you’ll need to jar your program, and add it too the list, by clicking add + in the wizard. So once you’ve supplied your jar file to the wizard, click next and you should see a frame like the following picture:<br>
<img src="http://img128.imageshack.us/img128/6281/next5ow9.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>What that is saying, is that you have completed the wizard, and you are now ready to compile your code natively. So, click finish, and you should come to the main screen. It will look the following picture.<br>
<img src="http://img55.imageshack.us/img55/4529/next6dr5.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>This is the place where you are able to make your last finishing touches, or edit a few things. Why they have the whole wizard I’ll never know. But, if you’re happy how your settings are, click Generate Executable, it can be located up near the top. Or, in easy terms, look at the picture below.<br>
<img src="http://img441.imageshack.us/img441/1633/next7td8.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>When you click Generate Executable, a new window will open up. It will look something like this if it was successful.<br>
<img src="http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/3743/next8mj3.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Otherwise, you stuffed up somewhere.</p>
<p>Sorry if this seems a nooby tutorial, but I merely created it out of boredness, and to help people who want to create .exe files with their programs, instead of jars. And please, don’t flame me. Because simply, I do not care. I’d like too see people start posting tutorials in Java Programming a bit more, instead of the craze with the progress of  “Java Games”. I might be the only one who wants too see more tutorials and more activity in the Java section. So, here I am, out on the field. Who’s with me?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
