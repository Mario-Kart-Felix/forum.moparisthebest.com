    <title>[508] NPC Death &amp; Attack Animations</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-npc-death-attack-animations/262018</link>
    <description>I am a little nervous posting this with all these locks going on, but I am going to follow the question format so hopefully this does not get locked. :|


Anyway, as some of you may know I am creating a 508 godwars. My problem is, I have added Ogres to the bandos killcount, but when they attack and die, their body spreads out all over the place and makes them look deranged.

I have tried editing the NpcCombat class getDeathAnim() and getAttackAnim() methods, but it really took no effect at all. Of course, I was using the basic attack and death animations from a 317 server, and I have been wondering if the animations are completely different with different graphics.

Here is my code:

getAttackAnim:

[code]		else if (n.npcType == 115) {
			return 128;
		}[/code]

getDeathAnim:

[code]		} else if (n.npcType == 115) {
			return 131;[/code]


Here is the list I got it from, this is for 317.

[code]giant emote!

127  = walk
128  = slash with sword
129  = block
130  = stand
131  = dead
132  = mage atk like god spell
133  = tele shrink
134  = tele re-Grow[/code]


There could be many things wrong here, ranging from Giant attack animations being different from ogres, to the animations being different on 508s then 317s(my guess).

Any help is truly appreciated.

And if you don&#39;t know what my question is, I am asking if the animations are different, and if not what am I doing wrong.</description>
