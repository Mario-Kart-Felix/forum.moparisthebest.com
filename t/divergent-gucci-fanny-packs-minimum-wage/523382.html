In fact, says one INS agent, ?"Three of the five were people who had, several years ago, engaged in an extra-territorial attack over a tourist hotel within Cuba.?"Alpha insists those individuals were unarmed. These days, one of the most radical thing about Alpha dog is its rhetoric. It makes daily problems on Cuba with shortwave broadcasts. The walls involving Alpha’s Little Havana headquarters tend to be lined with photographs of the glory times, when operatives tried out – with little good results – to undermine the particular Cuban economy. But everything is now a diminishing memory.?“It’s a remnant Of the past,?” says Teacher Suchlicki. ?“Right now they are left above, they’re older, they just don’t have the power that that they.?” But for the previous warriors, time has was still.
