    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;ve never been a good JAVA programmer but I recently realized I have an unused Mac Mini in my basement. It has 2GB RAM, a Core Duo processor, and I have amazing internet. I have 54 mbps up 54 mbps down. Also, I have a spare web host that I use and I&#39;d be happy to make vBulletin/phpBB/SMF forums and a Joomla/Drupal CMS. Also, I&#39;m proficient at Photoshop and Dreamweaver. All you would have to worry about is programming. I will of course set up a dropbox on the mac. If Mac OS is an issue I was planning on dual booting Debian or Windows Server 2008 or perhaps another Windows OS. The Mac Mini is entirely unused and would be used 100% to host our server, 24/7 of course.

Here&#39;s my speedtest: [img]http://www.speedtest.net/result/1365321847.png[/img]

So, if you want to know more about me and want to make the server, MSN me at the following address.
[email]ryan_nojunk@yahoo.com[/email]

[U]Please only inquire if you are an experienced, proficient programmer and a normal, easy to talk to, and not totally a dick. [/U]

Thanks,
Ryan</description>

              <p>Not trying to be a bitch or anything here, but if your hosting a server off your own computer and off your own internet, it will be very easy for you to get ddosed. Part of the reason I closed my 614 server was because one kid kept ddosing me.</p>
