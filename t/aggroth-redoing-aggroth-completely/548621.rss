    <title>[Aggroth] - Redoing Aggroth - Completely</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/aggroth-redoing-aggroth-completely/548621</link>
    <description>[b]Hello Mopar.[/b]

Since i&#39;ve had alot of free time on my hands right now, i decided to kind-of redo Aggroth a bit.
Over 20K views is on Aggroth V2 now, so i guess people really like Aggroth.
I did too... Which is why it sucked that i had to stop.
I will be redoing everything from a clean Netty PI now.
I will post daily updates.

[b]Unique Skills[/b]
[spoiler]
[b]Respect[/b]
[spoiler]
This skill is called &#39;Respect&#39;.
You can gain respect EXP by helping npc&#39;s around Aggroth.
Currently one area is finished.

Storyline:

Area one:

A mean king has conquered a small desert city in Al-Kharid.
His guards are ordered to keep an eye on his workers, who are mining the roads, and the rest of the city.
They are working in a desert, and what&#39;s better then a cold beer when you&#39;re thirsty and tired, right?
The guards have more beer then they need, so your task is to kill the guards to gain their beer.
Killing guards will give you 500 respect experience.
When you gain a beer, (1:5), you can give the beer to one of the hard workers.
Because they know you, and respect you, you will gain 10.000 respect experience.
