Heres my first try at it with MS paint, I am new to managa on computers though LOl I can scetch him out if i wanted to, but on a computer it is very dificult! YEAH! Took me 3 straight hours just to get the screen right. and about 1 hour to fix the keyboard because I had it spaced out to far so I have to shorten it.
