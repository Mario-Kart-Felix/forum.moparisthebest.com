    <title>Server Staff and Testing Required</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-staff-and-testing-required/555024</link>
    <description>Hi there, I&#39;ve decided to upload a server I&#39;ve been working on.
I didn&#39;t create it or it&#39;s client, I just edited it. Donations won&#39;t be accepted and credit is given where due.
This server is just for fun at the minute, but maybe in the future I&#39;ll fix it up properly.

The main focuses of this server and selling point would be that it&#39;s of course PK based, but Drop Parties will be hosted regularly and players can also host there own.
The server has working PVM including a variety of bosses, and minigames.
Staffzone seems to be unavailable, but donators island and ownerzone are working.
Owner zone will be available to Co Owner and Head Admin.
Please feel free to download and test drive. There are no players at this time, but I&#39;ll help out as best I can :P 
Many many thanks.
Your Gracious Host - NiallSpoon
