              <p>Huh, i donâ€™t get what you mean change the no-ip. to 0.0.0.0 and when you have port foward the server you can change it to what ever your new ip is <a href="http://www.runelocus.com/?action=rspstut" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.runelocus.com/?action=rspstut</a></p>
<p>Is a great guide there how to portfoward your server.</p>
