    <title>Connection Error?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-error/333410</link>
    <description>Hi, so i just started a server and my port forwarding works and everything is set to run. So i started the server and checked if it was online using RuneLocus server checker and it says its online. The problem i have is that when i try and connect using a client this is what it says in the server CMD: 

Connection from 192.168.**.***       &lt;&lt;&lt; I have hidden my ip address.      
Connection reset
java.net.SocketException: Connection reset
     at java.net.SocketInputStream.read&lt;uknown Source&gt;
     at client.fillinStream&lt;client.java:9855
     at client.run&lt;client.java:18634&gt;
     at java.lang.Thread.run&lt;uknown Source&gt;
ClientHandler: Client null disconnected &lt;192.168.**.***&gt;

It does this three times then on the client it says &quot;error connecting to server&quot;
If you know how to fix please let me know! Thanks</description>
