    <title>Connection Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-error/553218</link>
    <description>Hi, I am very new to private servers and am sorry if this is a common/easy problem to fix but whenever I log into my server it instantly says &quot;connection lost&quot; and logs me out.
Both the server and client seem to be running fine until this happens. Here is a picture of what the server does when I log in:

I am using the source and client from a 2006 rs remake here:

Any help is highly appreciated. Thank you for your time.</description>
