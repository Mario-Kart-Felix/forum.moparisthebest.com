    <title>Connection Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-error/162579</link>
    <description>I have a problem on my server, its very annoying, and it affects everyone on it. :mad:

I run my server 24/7 on my computer, with the occasional restart of the computer. But, I have a major bug in my server.

Whenever I run the server, people start connecting, and usually after a minute or two, I get this error..

[CODE]Unable to start port listener on port 43594 - Make sure port isn&#39;t in use.[/CODE]

It&#39;s not exactly like that, but something like that. Anyway, I know what the error means! I&#39;m not an idiot, I&#39;ve been using private server for almost a year now, and I know a lot about the private servers.

I don&#39;t run anything else on the computer that run on that port. On average, I&#39;m usually running:

Firefox
Smart FTP
MSN
iTunes
Private Server w/ Auto Restarter

That&#39;s about it. I know none of those programs are taking up the port of 43594. I even tried other ports, but to no avail.

I&#39;m guessing it has something to do with my auto restarter, but maybe not. 

When I get this error..

[CODE]Unable to start port listener on port 43594 - Make sure port isn&#39;t in use.[/CODE]

People are still playing on the server! But, if someone would happen to log off and try to get in, it wouldn&#39;t allow them to.

So I set my auto restarter to about 10 minutes because of this. But that usually creates a problem. When my restarter kicks everyone out, sometimes the error comes back immediately, not letting anyone log in for the next 10 minutes.

I think that&#39;s all the information I need to let you guys know about. If I forgot something, or if you have any questions, just post them here, and I&#39;ll reply ASAP.

Thanks! ;)</description>

or try and change the port to 5555<br>
(in server.java) and you will need to prtforward again <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>or check your exceptions tab in your firewall, make sure nothing else is 43594 port</p>
