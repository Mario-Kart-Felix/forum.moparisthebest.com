    <description>ok guys so i have 3 pcs and ive made 2 of them run servers on different ports and my server accesses same character file, this makes it so i have 2 worlds but only problem with this is you can log on your character on both worlds at the same time creating the capability of purposely rolling your character back any ideas on how to make it so you cant log if your character is in use on another world?</description>
