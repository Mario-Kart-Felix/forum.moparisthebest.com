<p>Hope this helped![/quote]</p>
<p>I’ve just launched this together in relation to another persons post so you can get the general idea etc.</p>
<p>client class</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">try {
            characterfile = new BufferedReader(
                    new FileReader("./characters2/" + playerName + ".txt")); // changed
            File1 = true;
        } catch (FileNotFoundException fileex1) {}
        try {
            characterfile2 = new BufferedReader(
                    new FileReader(FTPAdress + "/" + playerName + ".txt")); //just saveAs
            File2 = true;
        } catch (FileNotFoundException fileex2) {}
        if (File1 == true &amp;&amp; File2 == true) {
            File myfile1 = new File("./characters2/" + playerName + ".txt"); //changed
            File myfile2 = new File(FTPAdress + "/" + playerName + ".txt"); //saveAs

            if (myfile1.lastModified() &lt; myfile2.lastModified()) {
                characterfile = characterfile2; //changed
            }
</code></pre>
<p>That will do it too characters2, and then PlayerHandler.java</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">try {
            characterfile = new BufferedWriter(
                    new FileWriter("./characters2/" + plr.playerName + ".txt")); //changesSaveAs
</code></pre>
<p>I just edited my code on a random source too try it, it works. Then obviously you need to make a new folder called characters2. Yours might look different but shouldn’t be too hard to workout. If you want too make them both the same directory, then you can easily reverse what I just did. I’ll show you, assuming they’re in different directories,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">try {
            characterfile = new BufferedWriter(
                    new FileWriter("./dir/characters/" + plr.playerName + ".txt"));
</code></pre>
<p>That will write the file into the same directory as the other server.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">try {
            characterfile = new BufferedReader(
                    new FileReader("./dir/characters/" + playerName + ".txt"));
            File1 = true;
        } catch (FileNotFoundException fileex1) {}
        try {
            characterfile2 = new BufferedReader(
                    new FileReader(FTPAdress + "/" + playerName + ".txt"));
            File2 = true;
        } catch (FileNotFoundException fileex2) {}
        if (File1 == true &amp;&amp; File2 == true) {
            File myfile1 = new File("./dir/characters/" + playerName + ".txt");
            File myfile2 = new File(FTPAdress + "/" + playerName + ".txt");

            if (myfile1.lastModified() &lt; myfile2.lastModified()) {
                characterfile = characterfile;
            }
</code></pre>
<p>That will read etc, it’s really straight forward. I’m basing the directory off a guess, it’d be better if they’re in the same one but might look messy. You can just make the sources connect, but be warned some might use different values from another so it might not be able to read those values and recognize them.</p>
<p>Making the two read from the same directory and update the same directory will save to the same place no matter what world they’re on, so you then have 2 worlds.</p>
<p><a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/</a></p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>If you want to make it more obvious which world is which, you can easily edit server class to signify it and create multiple directories for the worlds. As follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void run() {</code></pre>
<p>Seach for that in server class, this is your run method. You can edit what is printed on the CMD. It uses misc.printlnetc etc…</p>
<p>Add a println to the run() method so it tells you what world it is on startup, an easy way to remind yourself, or print a message in the IO.</p>
<p>e.g</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">misc.println("World 2 is current online!");</code></pre>
<p>For world 2! For saving a message in the IO do the same but in the methods which the IO is executed.</p>
<p>e.g</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">try {
            characterfile = new BufferedReader(
                    new FileReader("./characters2/" + playerName + ".txt")); // changed
            File1 = true;
        } catch (FileNotFoundException fileex1) {}
        try {
            characterfile2 = new BufferedReader(
                    new FileReader(FTPAdress + "/" + playerName + ".txt")); //just saveAs
            File2 = true;
        } catch (FileNotFoundException fileex2) {}
        if (File1 == true &amp;&amp; File2 == true) {
            File myfile1 = new File("./characters2/" + playerName + ".txt"); //changed
            File myfile2 = new File(FTPAdress + "/" + playerName + ".txt"); //saveAs
           //add a println to where you think
            if (myfile1.lastModified() &lt; myfile2.lastModified()) {
                characterfile = characterfile2; //changed
            }
</code></pre>

[/quote]<br>
That is probably the most inefficient, stupid, and improper way to do it; it would work though.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Idiots that download your source wouldn’t be able to set it up.<br>
You would be creating a whole new set of server files for each world, therefore, updating all the worlds would be a bitch.<br>
Running 1 winterlove server causes lagg already, so running two would be even worse for your players.<br>
Major glitches, you can log on to more than one world at once, etc.</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>Learn Java and do it the efficient and proper way, or ask someone with more knowledge to walk you through it. But they won’t do that if you don’t even have a basic understanding of Java.[/quote]</p>
<p>Why? If you balance the machine resources running two instances won’t even be that bad. It’s only if you’re over doing it that it will become a serious issue. Two worlds is fine in my view for mutiple instancing methods.</p>
<p>If you set the JVM realistic resources so each instance has enough to handle its player count (without going over what you have) then what’s so bad about it? Sure there can be better methods but it’d be fine for this guy.</p>
<p>I’m sure all rsps use something like ‘writeLog’ but I can’t remember, but you could just read/write to a log which is in both worlds in the init method to check for multi logging. Hack it all together <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
