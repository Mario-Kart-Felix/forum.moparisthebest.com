              <p>The point of having multiple servers on multiple hosts is so 1, you lower your costs. Why would you buy a vps with higher specs, when you can buy two lower grade vps’s for less money… 2, what if you get DOS or DDOS having both both servers on the same host with be taken down faster then having them on multiple hosts.</p>

But with one server, that can hold more than 4k players, you can host 2 worlds imbedded inside, of course with some restrictions of each player in different worlds talking to each other.  That would be stupid to run multiple servers though, cause then you would be using 2x much as CPU and memory, when you can just have it all as one, but obviously it has to be stable enough<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>What do you mean 2x as much CPU and memory… Running the worlds on a single host will cost you far more then running on multiple hosts that are lower grade… I don’t see why you would waste your money on a big dedicated server with 16 cores and 32gbs of ram to host a few worlds, when if your server is good enough to run on a duo or quad core with a few gbs of ram which would cost you far less then having to buy a bunch of pre build dedicated servers, unless you want to buy everything and then buy space at a data center…[/quote]<br>
Why would you go through the trouble of buying multiple vps’s to run multiple servers?  It would 2x as much CPU &amp; memory if your running two servers on one VPS.</p>

<p>You would have to do client hacking for the 4000 - 5000 players which is stupid to do when the limit is their for a reason, so multiple servers doesn’t equal reduced lag, what it does equal is more money wasted on a higher spec computer since most fucktards that host think you need a 16 core box with 32 gbs of ram to host. When if you did things right you would only really need either a duo or quad with a few gbs of ram, or even you could set up a cloud with multiple higher grade boxes and then host them that way…</p>

Apparently… you are obsessed with using more than one period to end a sentence… as if you are rambling and pausing in real life, and you can’t go back and change what you typed… And it does take a rather long amount of time, probably 3-5 hours… which is a long time if it’s not your server you’re working on…</p>

Then what the hell is the point of having two servers? That’s just like having one with two groundlevels. An equal amount of lag.<br>
The point of multiple servers is [usually] to reduce lag on the first one.</p>
