    <description>I was browsing google and found iClarity [b][size=50pt]508[/size][/b]!!
And then... I cummed myself.

Well heres the post:

EDIT: Unquoted so it&#39;s easier to see.
[center][SIZE=7][COLOR=RoyalBlue]iClarity[/COLOR][/SIZE]

[SIZE=5][COLOR=Orange]Introduction[/COLOR][/SIZE]As you probably know, iClarity 317 was a huge success, as loads of people used it as their base. As a result of this me and PrimaDude wanted to take it to the next level; we decided to create a 508. Primadude already, in the past, created a 508 server, which is what we are going to use as a base this time. We are going to remove most of the current content (E.g minigames, skills etc) and re-write them to replace with newer and better ones. We decided to use the 508 revision because it has a wider range of things we can do, and instead of &#39;hardcoding&#39; all the graphics, animations and items, we have them already done for us. We hope you will all enjoy watching this progress to become one of the best 508&#39;s developed, and we hope you join us to play it once it is in Beta/finished :).[/COLOR]

[SIZE=5][COLOR=Orange]General[/COLOR][/SIZE]
[COLOR=&quot;LemonChiffon&quot;]The server will not be based around Player Killing, as it there is much more potential when we use the full load. iClarity will still have near-to-perfect Player Killing, but also you need a sense of achievement, which is why we are using the full-Runescape world and nearly all skills to create what will become possibly the greatest 508 ever made.
The experience rate will be set to Runescape&#39;s exp, but will be multiplied by a separate integer to make it very easy to change the rates (E.G. 4x, 10x, 100x). We will decide at a later date what the XP rate will stay at, however, it will not be too fast, nor too slow. iClarity&#39;s economy will be a big factor of it&#39;s success; it won&#39;t be bad like most of the current servers you see (which you can buy rare items from shops); it will be properly done, for example, you will have to earn rare/high level weapons/armours from high level monsters (Such as GodWars, Abyssal Demons etc).[/COLOR]

[SIZE=5][COLOR=Orange]Minigames[/COLOR][/SIZE]
[COLOR=&quot;LemonChiffon&quot;]There will be various mini games such as Fight Pits, Pest Control, Duel Arena, custom made ones, and more, so you will never get bored.[/COLOR]

[SIZE=5][COLOR=Orange]Skills[/COLOR][/SIZE]
[COLOR=&quot;LemonChiffon&quot;]We will have basically all skills apart from Summoning, Construction, Hunter, Farming, this will be a major aspect to the game since it&#39;s a very important way how to make money besides slaying monsters.[/COLOR]

[SIZE=5][COLOR=Orange]Bosses[/COLOR][/SIZE]Looking for a challenge? Then iClarity is for you. iClarity will contain very hard bosses to beat; you will have to use teams, tactics and all your strength to slay these beasts. If you succeed in slaying these monsters, you will not always get a good drop, but there are VERY good drops to be gained if you stick at it. Some examples of bosses are the King Black Dragon, Kalphite Queen, Godwars bosses, and many many more..

[SIZE=5][COLOR=Orange]Updates[/COLOR][/SIZE]
- Cleaned out old Summon-Pkz base(made by PrimaDude)
- Re-wrote combat([COLOR=MediumTurquoise]melee[/COLOR]), Found a dcing bug, and fixed that
- Got sounds for near enough everything
- Got all combat items speeds.
- Got most animations
- Vengance done[/COLOR]

[SIZE=5][COLOR=Orange]Media[/COLOR][/SIZE]When you die and you have got either a Fire Cape, Metal Gloves, Torso, Defender it stays on the ground its not much but yeah
