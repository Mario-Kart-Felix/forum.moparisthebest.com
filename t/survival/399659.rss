    <description>I don&#39;t support this new plugin in anyway, or any editing of pvp. But if you&#39;re going to do this and as David described make people help each other survive, and think like we&#39;re all in this game together then I think survival needs to be made more challenging. This is one of the very core reasons why myself and a few others consider raiding, and pvp.

To survive all one needs to do is mine 30 blocks, get coal and make a few torches and boom, you&#39;re safe from mobs. It isn&#39;t survival it&#39;s just plain easy and gets boring. I think actually surviving needs to be made more difficult, which means people would actually want to work together because it would be harder to survive. Right now it&#39;s incredibly easy to survive and you don&#39;t need anyone else&#39;s help at all, you can be a long independent raider. 

I think this needs to change, it would surely make up for the plugins and changes people want. It just readds that edge to the game that pvp and raiding has. I don&#39;t want to jump the gun and go off suggesting ways, so what do you think? And what would you suggest?</description>

<p>On another note, the adding of the protection plugin would worsen the current situation, it certainly wouldn’t stop me raiding people. If I intended to raid someone who had protected there area I would probably go for a highway man approach.</p>
<p>Just like on runescape, they would patrol between two cities or a highly resource rich area. If you think about it, this plugin could <span class="bbcode-b">help</span> raiders because it would allow someone to starve another of resources.</p>

              <p>Yea I meant we should probably move it when I said it should be public <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>But to be honest, to me it sounds like changing it around would be kinda pointless with the same map, because it’s all already been done (IE people been stolen from, unbalanced power etc)</p>
<p>It would also be the perfect opportunity to put that anti-xray mod (and maybe a new speed hack mod?) in to make the game even MORE balanced…</p>
<p>Also, what’s so bad about a reset? (Besides the fact that you promised you wouldn’t) Shouldn’t it be a vote like everything else?</p>

<p>I don’t care about configuration/plugin changes and stuff, but as you guys guessed I am 100% against a map reset, if things around spawn are too messed up, we can move spawn, that isn’t a problem.  But as before, many don’t want a map reset, many might want one, but the ones that want one can go someplace else, the ones that don’t can’t move their creation to a new map.  I’ve always said and promised I wouldn’t reset the map unless no choice was given like the last time (when it was corrupted), so I’m not going to reset it (like I said, a spawn relocation would be OK though).[/quote]I’m all up for moving the topic. As for more moving spawn if its really necessary we can build a city somewhere and move it there.</p>
