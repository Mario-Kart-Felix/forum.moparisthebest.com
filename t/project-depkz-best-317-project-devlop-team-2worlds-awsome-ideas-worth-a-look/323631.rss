    <description>All my other ones were deleted as requested now here is the final Thread i will make for this topic. 


Be for i start i would like to say thanks to all my supporters be for. and i will be coding a bit more i am changing to a 317 server so it will be much more friendly and easier for my self to code. there will be a lot of changes in this project. 1st of if you click the forums can you please set me up a new one the person that made it did an awesome job but did not make me admin. even though it was my server lol. this will probably have 2 worlds. one world F2P and the other one P2P ( you don&#39;t have to pay ) there will be a donation option on the game. like if u want to buy a rare example phat they will probably have 3% rate drop and you can only get it from the general guardian. this is not a pk only server. the starter will be about 5mill to get you started.
