    <description>not totally sure if this is server side or client side because the animations are defined server side so sorry if this is in the wrong section

im currently using RuneLive source and have come across a big issue with the npc animations, a lot of the animations are incorecct for the npc&#39;s i know the source has a lot of new animations however im begining to think that the animations were replaced while only some np&#39;s were and now the animations are incompatible because the npc&#39;s walk strangely and gargoyles just look like a ball of grey mess lol

i checked the animations in npc handler with a PI source i have and they are the same, so i think the issue is is that its loading new animations for old npc&#39;s, i could be wrong tho lol (probably am) any help on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated :)
