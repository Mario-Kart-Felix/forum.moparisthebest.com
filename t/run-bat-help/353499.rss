    <title>Run.Bat Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/run-bat-help/353499</link>
    <description>I made my own DL client + Source.
But I had problems with my computer and a lot of files got deleted.
Between those files i lsot the run.bat for my client.
So I have no run.bat at all or the link where I got my client because I made it myself and I never posted it up or uploaded it anywhere.
Does anyone have any idea how to make a brand new run.bat for my client.
Thanks a lot.</description>
