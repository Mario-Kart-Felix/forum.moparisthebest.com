    <description>I know you all probably get this a whole ton, but I added the 742 cache to my source, and I&#39;m looking on wondering how to fix the Nulled Npc&#39;s. Is this a client issue? I&#39;m trying to learn all of this, and learn how to fix. Could you possibly post a client (Not the no-regret client, it uses over 90% of my cpu for some reason) that has this fixed? Or if this is what I&#39;m thinking, the OP code issues, pm/post those? I&#39;d really love it if one of you could help me out. Thank you very much
