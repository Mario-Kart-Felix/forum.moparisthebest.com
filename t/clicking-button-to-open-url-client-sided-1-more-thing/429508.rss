    <title>Clicking button to open url (Client SIDED) + 1 more thing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clicking-button-to-open-url-client-sided-1-more-thing/429508</link>
    <description>First, I&#39;d like to state I&#39;m not stupid. I know this is supposed to be server sided.
Or you can add a client sided command.
My problem is my client/server doesn&#39;t support opening webpages by command (server sided that is) If someone could link a tut that&#39;d be cool too
I want to make it so when you click an interface it opens a webpage, but client sided

other thing:
Is it possible to make my loader a .gif?</description>

I know what I’m doing to a point. What I was trying to achieve is to make a server-sided command, ::allvote, when I type it in it would have everyone’s client open the vote screen, unless they were in combat or in wild.[/quote]</p>
<p>If you want to do hat, i would suggest looking into opeming web pages in java. I think theres a method in javax.swing.JEditorPane that might load a URL.</p>

              <p>I didn’t mean like that. I meant like, the server won’t send the url’s to the client for it to open the browser.<br>
you know the command like this:<br>
if(command.equalsignorecase(“vote”); {<br>
sendMessage(“<a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.google.com</a>”, 12000);<br>

<p>Or what ever.<br>
I’m at school and not thinking about this. I know the sendMessage isn’t the correct thing.</p>

So, if I understand correctly, you want to change the default loading bar to a rotating circle?</p>
<p>I’m not quite sure how that deals with URLs…</p>
<p>As for opening links through the browser, I personally wouldn’t implement any system like that. You could be playing a server one day, not knowing that you can’t use commands, and when you go to try one, your browser opens up an unwanted webpage.</p>
<p>You would also have a (slight) problem in determining which internet browser to use (not all computers have Internet Explorer, or Firefox, or Chrome, or Safari, etc)<br>

So, if I understand correctly, you want to change the default loading bar to a rotating circle?</p>

<p>As for opening links through the browser, I personally wouldn’t implement any system like that. You could be playing a server one day, not knowing that you can’t use commands, and when you go to try one, your browser opens up an unwanted webpage.</p>

If I understand you correctly…you want to make it so when you click on the image while the webclient i sloading (aka applet/jar) you want it to send you to a certain url?</p>
<p>This is pure assumptions here because my web knowledge is horrible…but there should be a way to make a webpage open up by visiting the page.  I am not honestly sure you may want to ask that in the general programming area.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I think I got you confused lol.<br>
I want to change my loading image to the one above.</p>
<p>As for the vote system. I want to make it possible to make it so when you click an image in game it would open a client, like if you were to do ::vote.[/quote]ah okay I see now</p>
<p>well for the vote thing. There is a guide somewhere on how to make a command that takes somebody to a site for example ::forum would take you to your forums there is a guide for this you would just add that line into the clickingbuttons.</p>
<p>so…</p>
<p>case blah:<br>

<p>For the loading image R-S had a tut for the loading image</p>

              <p>First, I’d like to state I’m not stupid. I know this is supposed to be server sided.<br>
Or you can add a client sided command.<br>
My problem is my client/server doesn’t support opening webpages by command (server sided that is) If someone could link a tut that’d be cool too<br>
I want to make it so when you click an interface it opens a webpage, but client sided</p>
<p>other thing:<br>
Is it possible to make my loader a .gif?</p>
