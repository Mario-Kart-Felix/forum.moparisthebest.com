        <p>This board is relatively inactive and misused, which is disappointing because I’ve seen some (read: few) pseudo-intellectual discussions take place, and they were atleast thought provoking. Let’s get an <span class="bbcode-i">actual</span> intellectual discussion going; not some mundane debate about a black-and-white topic, but at the same time not some esoteric bullshit either. I digress.</p>
<p>I’ll switch focus to the discussion on hand, life. I’d like to hear everyone’s opinion on life. While this may seem relatively simple, I think it’s a good way to get Moparscape started with intellectual discussion- mostly because it doesn’t require any background knowledge to discuss. I’ll throw around a few example questions which you guys could respond to. Don’t feel like you need to answer these specific questions, if you have something relevant to contribute, by all means, do it.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>Why are we alive?</p>
<p>Are living organisms more important than nonliving objects?</p>
<p>If the entire human population was decimated, would it ‘matter’, on the grand scale of the universe?</p>
<p>Do living (or even nonliving) objects have any intrinsic value whatsoever? What’s the ‘point’?</p>
<p>Every living organism eventually dies. Assuming there is no afterlife, what is the point of living if we are condemned to die?</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>I’ll fire up the discussion a bit myself, also. In my opinion, life has no intrinsic value or meaning. Life was most likely a mistake, there’s nothing all too special about it. A human life, an animal’s life, or a bug’s life all have the same value-zero. If the entire human population were to disappear, the universe would not notice or care.<br>
You don’t have to agree with me, in fact I encourage that you disagree and debate this with me, I’d like to get something interesting started on this board.</p>
<p>I’ll mention, it would be good if you all could <span class="bbcode-b">not bring religion into this debate</span>. If you’re religious, that’s great for you, <span class="bbcode-b">you’ve already found your answer to all of these questions</span>. Unfortunately, bringing religion into this discussion will not work. This is for a few reasons.</p>
<p>[ul][li]It is impossible to debate religion, there is no way to prove or disprove it.[/li]<br>
[li]The discussion would turn into an atheism vs religion debate, which are <span class="bbcode-i">not thought provoking in the slightest</span>. Having a debate between two sides unwilling to change their mind is useless, anyway.[/li]<br>
[li]It turns into mindless bashing of the other person’s point of view, which is extremely boring to read.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>EDIT: I’d just like to add, I know that the questions are fairly one-sided. If you have better questions of or about life, ask them in the thread and we can have a discussion.</p>

        <p>Q: Why are we alive?<br>
A: Because we aren’t dead yet.</p>
<p>Q: Are living organisms more important than nonliving objects?<br>
A: Define important-</p>
<p>Q: If the entire human population was decimated, would it ‘matter’, on the grand scale of the universe?<br>
A: The universe have no goal or purpose, so nothing matters.</p>
<p>Q: Do living (or even nonliving) objects have any intrinsic value whatsoever? What’s the ‘point’?<br>
A: Define value.</p>

A: Nobody owes you a purpose for our lives.</p>
<p>6: The questions you’re asking make no sense if you exclude religion, as all of them are of religious nature.</p>

All of your questions do have religious nature and you said to leave religion out. You said asumming there is no afterlife, what is the point to life? There is no point to live. The only point to living is to die as Bowser said.</p>
<p>Why are we alive?<br>
There is no point to being alive. We are just alive and there is nothing else to it. You do not need some point in life you are simply alive and soon you will be dead.</p>
<p>Are living organisms more important than nonliving objects?<br>
As bowser said, define what you would say important is? I think that gasoline is really important as it fuels most of our machines and in nonliving so therefore is extremely important than say a bird. However birds are extremely important in the ecosystems of our world. Therefore, I’d say everything is equally important if you consider importance basically what role it plays in the universe.</p>
<p>If the entire human population was decimated, would it ‘matter’, on the grand scale of the universe?<br>
I don’t think losing 1/10 of the worlds population would matter at all. No matter if you talk about the grand scale of the universe or just the Earth. The Earth will still orbit the Sun and everything will still go on.</p>
<p>Do living (or even nonliving) objects have any intrinsic value whatsoever? What’s the ‘point’?<br>
What point? There is no point and living objects are no different than nonliving objects in the sense that we have some importance to life. We are just atoms that are bonded together that function as a whole.</p>
<p>Every living organism eventually dies. Assuming there is no afterlife, what is the point of living if we are condemned to die?<br>
There is no point of living. Why do you need a point to live?</p>

<p>I meant something along the lines of providing me with better questions to ask. I shouldn’t have to define words for you, but here you go. <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=define%3Aimportant" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Important</a>, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=define%3Aintrinsic+value" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">intrinsic value</a>. The questions are simple, and they are rather objective, I don’t know why you had so much trouble answering them. I don’t know how much more straightforward ‘intrinsic value’ could be, either.</p>

<p>Just because religion was created to answer those questions doesn’t mean that they can’t be answered otherwise. I’m not asking for an absolute answer, I’m asking for opinions and <span class="bbcode-b">discussion</span>.</p>
<p>I’ll followup by asking you a few questions based on your response.</p>
<p>Why don’t we have the answers? And are you saying that a correct answer does exist? If you aren’t saying that, do you believe that they could exist?</p>

Finally, you have learn to define the terms you’re talking about. I’m perfectly aware that you didn’t mean monetary value, I’m just playing with your refusal to clarify what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Question number 2:<br>
Yes, living objects are more valuable for society than non-living ones, and this therefore more important for humanity.</p>
<p>Question number 3. Since non-living objects have no concept of purpose. Only thing which happens to living organisms can matter. So yes, it would matter if humanity died tomorrow.

<p>Alright, now we can get somewhere.</p>
<p>a) But who decides what is valuable? If there’s no objective value, how can something possibly be more valuable than anything else?</p>
<p>b) I completely agree, only that which happens to living organisms can matter, because things ‘mattering’ is a human construct. However, animals have no concept of purpose. Humans are the only mammal to have a high enough level of reasoning to consider such things, do they matter?<br>
I have an interesting question for you. If living objects are only valuable to society, and all that matters is what is important to humanity (refer to a); then how could anything matter if humans and society died?</p>
<p>c) The question was meant to be a bit more metaphysical in nature. The question was if any object really matters at all.</p>
<p>d) I’ll prove that it can be answered in a variety of ways without religion.</p>

        <p>Animals also have a purpose in life. So the death of humanity would matter for them. Animals would also mourn the death of their owner, so you cannot say that their not affected by the event on an emotional level.</p>
<p>We can objectively decide a object’s value in a society by looking at its usefulness and supply compared to demand. Living objects are more valuable as they give non-living objects value. A pick axe is useful for mining, but worthless without a miner, apart from the value of the materials. But the materials have no value either if there is nobody to process it.</p>

Even though everyone knows this fact, they still blindly believe in their religions. They just don’t want to face the fact that life is generally meaningless. Nobody has set purpose, we mold it ourselves and live to fulfill our own created purpose.</p>

        <p>My opinions:</p>
<p>Why are we alive?<br>
Because the Universe is big and in a sense we were accidentally created and since then we have clung to life fearful of death, fearful of not existing. (Not bringing religion into this, when I say God I mean existence, not the guy with a beard that’s up in the clouds) In a sense if I were to call anything God I’d call existence God. In a sense humans are like the cells in the human body (human body = universe, cells = us). We are a part of the Universe, we live and we die and on our own we are essentially valueless but when you bundle us all up together you can get an amazing thing (I used the word ‘thing’ because depending on the way the words I could use are interpreted it could be seen as wrong).</p>
<p>Are living organisms more important than nonliving objects?<br>
It depends on who’s answering the question. To other living organisms, living organisms are, but in the grand scale of things we are not.</p>
<p>If the entire human population was decimated, would it ‘matter’, on the grand scale of the universe?<br>
It would not because all that we are still exists in a different form. But again, you need to define what does matter (and other words) in order to answer that question correctly (in relation to what the person defines as correct).</p>
<p>Do living (or even nonliving) objects have any intrinsic value whatsoever? What’s the ‘point’?<br>
None whatsoever.</p>
<p>Every living organism eventually dies. Assuming there is no afterlife, what is the point of living if we are condemned to die?<br>
Their is no point but we try to give ourselves reasons to live with the distractions of life. I.e. Let’s say you have a couple of kids; you would want to make sure they are healthy, happy etc. That is a distraction from the emptiness that existence is.</p>
<p>All of those questions answers completely depend on what the answerers (dat wording) perception of ‘x’ are. We’re trying to find answers that their are no answer to or maybe we just aren’t capable of thinking in the ‘correct’ way to understand the answers.</p>

<p>We can objectively decide a object’s value in a society by looking at its usefulness and supply compared to demand. Living objects are more valuable as they give non-living objects value.

<p>Well, that’s great for you. Like I said in the OP, you’ve already figured out the answer to the questions. You won’t change your mind by anything anybody could say in this thread, so there’s nothing you can really gain from it. Besides, when religion is brought into a debate it becomes a religion vs atheism shitstorm, which isn’t intellectual in the slightest.</p>
