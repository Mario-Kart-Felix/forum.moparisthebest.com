    <description>Whats the meaning of life?

Monty Python :D

&quot;Just remember that you’re standing on a planet {classical planet, as opposed to dwarf planet, as in Pluto - the dwarf that is not able to clear its neighborhood} that’s evolving and revolving at nine hundred miles an hour. 
It’s orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it’s reckoned, a sun that is the source of all our power. 
The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see, are moving at a million miles a day. 
In an outer spiral arm at forty thousand miles an hour, 
in a galaxy we call the Milky Way 

Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars. 
It’s a hundred thousand light years side to side. 
It bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light years thick, but out by us it’s just three thousand light years wide. We’re thirty thousand light years from galactic central point. 
We go ‘round every two hundred million years, and our galaxy is only one of millions of billions,in this amazing and expanding universe. 

The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding. 
In all the of the directions it can whiz, as fast as it can go, the speed of light you know. 
Twelve million miles a minute and that’s the fastest speed there is. 
So remember when you’re feeling very small and insecure 
How amazing.....&quot; 

— from Monty Python’s “The Meaning of Life” 


So, Whats yours?</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>On a very cold Sunday morning in a blizzard, Marge is gathering the family to go to church, but Homer refuses and goes back to his warm bed. After sleeping extra-late, he finally gets up and has fun with the house all to himself: He cranks up the heat, dances in his underwear (ala Tom Cruise in the film Risky Business), makes his Patented Space-Age Out of This World Moon Waffles, wins a radio trivia contest, watches a boring debate on TV get preempted for what turns out to be an action-packed football game, and finds a penny under the couch. Meanwhile Marge, the kids, and the rest of the congregation shiver their way through the service and a rambling sermon, only to find themselves trapped at the end because the door is frozen shut. To make matters worse, Marge is unable to start the car, the battery having gone dead.</p>
<p>They finally get home, and Homer tells Marge he’s had the best day of his life, all thanks to skipping church.</p>
<p>Marge is very angry with Homer for giving up on his faith. Homer gives her his reasons (e.g. “What if we picked the wrong religion? Every week we’re just making God madder and madder.”) and starts his own personal religion tailored just for himself. Marge prays in bed for her husband. Homer, meanwhile, falls asleep and has a dream where God appears to him. God is initially angry with Homer and shows it by bellowing thunderously, “THOU HAST FORSAKEN MY CHURCH!” Once He has calmed, Homer asks Him what’s the big deal of going to church when he can worship in his own way (“I’m a good husband, I work hard, and I love my kids…why should I spend half my Sunday hearing that I’m just going to hell anyway?”). God sees Homer’s point and agrees (“I guess it’s okay. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to appear in a tortilla in Mexico.”), and the dream ends.</p>
<p>Marge, Rev. Lovejoy, and the Flanders family all try to win Homer back to Christianity and fail. The next Sunday morning, Homer is once again at home while everyone else is at church. He smokes a cigar while reading Playdude magazines. Homer eventually falls asleep, and the lighted cigar he was smoking at the time falls on one of the magazines; the hot ash ignites the paper, and it isn’t long before the house is engulfed in flames.</p>
<p>Homer wakes up to find the house in flames, panics and succumbs to the thick smoke. Apu, a Hindu, spots the blaze and takes up his duties as part of Springfield’s volunteer fire department (of which the Jewish Krusty the Clown is also a member). Meanwhile, the Christian Ned tries to rescue Homer. After the fire department has extinguished the blaze, Homer fears that God was showing vengeance. However, Rev. Lovejoy points out that God was actually working in the hearts of Homer’s friends, despite their different faiths. Lovejoy convinces Homer to give church another try. Homer is at church next Sunday, but sleeps through the service. God appears in his dreams again and consoles Homer on the failure of his religion God starts to tell Homer the meaning of life, but the viewers never hear it because he is cut off by the credits, and Homer has never mentioned it.<br>
