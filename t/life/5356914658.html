<p>Why are we alive?<br>
Because the Universe is big and in a sense we were accidentally created and since then we have clung to life fearful of death, fearful of not existing.

In a sense humans are like the cells in the human body (human body = universe, cells = us). We are a part of the Universe, we live and we die and on our own we are essentially valueless <span class="bbcode-u">but when you bundle us all up together you can get an amazing thing</span> (I used the word ‘thing’ because depending on the way the words I could use are interpreted it could be seen as wrong).</p>
<p>Are living organisms more important than nonliving objects?<br>
It depends on who’s answering the question. To other living organisms, living organisms are, but in the grand scale of things we are not.</p>
<p>If the entire human population was decimated, would it ‘matter’, on the grand scale of the universe?<br>
It would not because all that we are still exists in a different form. But again, you need to define what does matter (and other words) in order to answer that question correctly (in relation to what the person defines as correct).</p>
<p>Do living (or even nonliving) objects have any intrinsic value whatsoever? What’s the ‘point’?<br>
None whatsoever.</p>
<p>Every living organism eventually dies. Assuming there is no afterlife, what is the point of living if we are condemned to die?<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Their is no point but we try to give ourselves reasons to live with the distractions of life. I.e. Let’s say you have a couple of kids; you would want to make sure they are healthy, happy etc. That is a distraction from the emptiness that existence is.<br>
</span></p>
<p>All of those questions answers completely depend on what the answerers (dat wording) perception of ‘x’ are. We’re trying to find answers that their are no answer to or maybe we just aren’t capable of thinking in the ‘correct’ way to understand the answers.</p>

<p>We have no way of knowing if we are important to the universe or not. None. I don’t believe if human existence is gone that it will impact the universe in a big way, but STILL there is no way of knowing. We can’t proof that the universe is real, it could be one big illusion, no way of telling.<br>

<p>“It is impossible to debate religion, there is no way to prove or disprove it.” and then you come up with a topic like this and call it intelligent… just /facepalm[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, the questions are opinion based, you are very perceptive. I think I mentioned that numerous times (because that is the <span class="bbcode-u">point</span>)… As for endless speculation having no point, it doesn’t need to have a point or a conclusion to be reached.</p>
<p>I’m not calling anything intelligent. I’m not calling my topic intelligent, I’m not calling myself intelligent, and I’m not calling you intelligent. Yes, it is impossible to debate religion, I didn’t feel like the topic becoming an atheism v. religion thread because there are already tons of those in this section.</p>

        <p>So many subjective questions. At times its just better to not ask questions and realize the answer is simply that there isn’t an answer or that the answer you are hoping to hear is not the answer to the question.</p>
<p>Why are we alive?</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Are living organisms more important than nonliving objects?</p>
<p>Subjective to different situations and who you are asking, and in what context you are asking.</p>
<p>If the entire human population was decimated, would it ‘matter’, on the grand scale of the universe?</p>
<p>No. Not at all. Subjective to humans. The universe does not revolve around humanity.</p>
<p>Do living (or even nonliving) objects have any intrinsic value whatsoever? What’s the ‘point’?</p>
<p>Well. ‘They’ are there. You cannot destroy matter and stop from it being where it is minus the force you exert to move it somewhere else. The point being is that you have limited power in the universe, and just get use to it.</p>
<p>Every living organism eventually dies. Assuming there is no afterlife, what is the point of living if we are condemned to die?</p>
<p>Well you get the chance to live. That’s pretty nice.</p>

<p>So many subjective questions. At times its just better to not ask questions and realize the answer is simply that there isn’t an answer or that the answer you are hoping to hear is not the answer to the question.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not hoping to hear an answer at all, the questions were made to be vague and subjective to spark discussion. I already know how I’d answer the questions, and my answers will likely never change ; ).</p>
<p>[quote=“sinisoul, post:24, topic:535691”]Are living organisms more important than nonliving objects?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subjective to different situations and who you are asking, and in what context you are asking.</p>

<p>If the entire human population was decimated, would it ‘matter’, on the grand scale of the universe?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No. Not at all. Subjective to humans. The universe does not revolve around humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do living (or even nonliving) objects have any intrinsic value whatsoever? What’s the ‘point’?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well. ‘They’ are there. You cannot destroy matter and stop from it being where it is minus the force you exert to move it somewhere else. The point being is that you have limited power in the universe, and just get use to it.[/quote]</p>

Read the wikipedia articles I linked Bowser_Jr, they should explain the context well.</p>

Yeah, I agree completely. You might want to read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmicism#Principles_of_cosmicism" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>, you could find it fairly interesting.</p>

Very metaphysical. You might want to read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysical_nihilism" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> article, it’s fairly interesting. I’ll quote it a bit:</p>

<p>[quote=“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysical_nihilism" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysical_nihilism</a>”]There could have been finitely many things.<br>
For each thing, that thing might not have existed.<br>
The removal of one thing does not necessitate the introduction of another.<br>
Therefore, there could have been no things at all.[/quote]</p>

As far as wikipedia goes, it’s pretty informative and provides a basic understanding of a topic in just one page whereas a book could take hundreds.</p>

I don’t mind stating what my beliefs are or learning about other beliefs, but you slandering this board saying there is no discussion and then by creating a thread where there can be little discussion just seems odd. I cannot suggest how to create a discussion where there is no discussion to be had. I also wasn’t saying wikipedia is bad haha. Wikipedia may be the most credible source out there nowadays.</p>
