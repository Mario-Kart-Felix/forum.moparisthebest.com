    <description>improving your computer proformance...(sorry for grammar or spelling mistakes im only 13 (excuses excuses):P)

Viruses:
viruses will probably be on your computer all the time if you have other user accounts on your computer.
to remove viruses you need a virus scanner (unless you know what files are infected.) some good virus scanners are:
norton antivirus(this can be expensive(i think you can download it somewhere))
adaware(removes adware mostly but gets rid of some viruses)
i will hopefully add some more in later...

adware and spyware:
adware and spyware arent the same but most adware scans pick up spyware too..
i use adaware and norton antivirus for spyware/adaware somethings dont get picked up by norton antivirus but adaware gets the rest i do have another program too but it doesnt pick up anything because norton and adaware gets it all

and lastly the proformance part
after downloading anything and installing you should really run a disk cleanup and and defragmentation
to do a defrag(defragmentation)go to start&gt;all programs&gt;accessories&gt;system tools&gt;disk defragmentation
follow the instructions...and at the bottom it will say some that #% done then its started....
the disk cleanup is located in the same folder (be patient as the two programs may take awhile to finish depending on how much stuff there is on your computer....)
if you have sims 2 this is highly rocommended doing because i got my new laptop not so long ago put sims on it and i done a disk defrag and folders were everywhere....</description>
