    <title>How to get into your router/firewall?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-get-into-your-router-firewall/223674</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i need help. On the post &quot;how to make a server&quot; in the tut&#39;s forum i did everything but unfortunataly it still didn&#39;t work. So im trying to do the optional step that says to go into your firewall and router and open up port 43594. But, i do not know how to do that. If someone could tell me how to get into my firewall and router and open up the port, that would be very helpfull. Also: please do it in step by step instructions, i do not do very well with just a big paragraph. Thanks and whoever does this for me will get rep!!!</description>

<p>in the command prompt type ‘ipconfig’ and you should see an ip address that looks similar to ‘192.186.0.130’ the last three numbers will be different than ‘130’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>6.after you have done that enter TDC and UDP ports as 43594, if you only have one place to inter a port then put it in as 43594 and make sure the firewall for it is set to allow.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>save this and and it should work if your windows firewall settings are on your can try the next step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if your running a windows operating system you can also try adding a port into your firewall settings, you shouldnt have to but just incase try this.</p>
