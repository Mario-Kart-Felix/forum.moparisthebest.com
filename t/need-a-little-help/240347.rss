    <title>Need a little help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-little-help/240347</link>
    <description>I am trying to wrap my head around all of this. I am a noob to Java but not to programming. I know a few programming concepts buy playing around with C# a couple years ago. Here are my questions:

1. What do I need to start to program and play a RS2 clone but not have anyone else play on it yet?
2. What do you suggest as the best (or safest) programs and/or tools that I need?
3. Other than the Sun Java web site, are there any other good sites to visit for tutorials/ebooks on Java?

Thanks in advance. If this in the wrong place, could a mod either move it or kill it please.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 02, 2008, 09:42:31 am[/size][hr]Has Anyone read this? Please just a little help.</description>
