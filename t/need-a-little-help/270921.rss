    <title>Need a little help</title>

    <description>Hello moparscape, right now i&#39;m going to be starting to code a delta based server and i need a little help;

I need to know how to remove objects where they already are, meaning ones that jagex put there.

I also need to know how to change where the teleports teleport you too, meaning in delta the varrock teleport teles you to the home area in the server, i would like it to tele to my home area, so i need a little help with that. Not just a modern spellbook, i also need the other spellbooks such as ancients as well thanks!

Just a tiny bit of logic help would be perfect!

Here&#39;s a picture to some it up a bit and make it easier for help; (I will upload after school, try to help with the information  thanks!)

I hope i can get some help soon, i&#39;ve tested so much stuff out and nothing seems to work, i&#39;ve pretty much searched all my files!</description>
