    <description>Well, i got everything good about the server i know how to code and everything. But I learned the steps wrong and now im confused lol.. I read mod tarhoks tutorial over like 10 times and ive been trying since a week ago. I can not get my server up. I want the server to run so other people can get on it obviously, but I dont know what to do. i know everything else but like when it says to set a rule for my router and stuff thats where i get lost. I need to set the rule, i have a no-ip account made and i have a server set but I dont know how to put all them together so it works.</description>
