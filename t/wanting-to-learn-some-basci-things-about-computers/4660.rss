    <description>hey I no really nothing about computers and seeing as I am wanting to get in to doing some very nice SRL SCAR scripts, I figured I should leanr some stuff about computers and instead of paying some one to teach me I thought i would ask you guys.

The first thing i want to  now is what does GHz mean and whats does RAM mean?

apparently my computer has 2.8GHz and504MB of RAM so what does that actually mean?</description>

<p>Build your own!!! You’ll probably have the computer of your dreams, and save ALOT of $$$ maybe $400-1.5k. Except, you seem like a person who knows little of computers, so I don’t think you’ll be doing that anytime soon. 1TB of space is over excessive, unless you have a library of porn <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>When it comes to computers, ask me ;). GHz is the number of clock cycles your processor can take on in a second, apparently, you computer can take on 2.8 billion clock cycles per second which compared to other computers nowadays is crap <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
RAM stands for Random Access Memory and serves as fast access to memory, such as in a videogame you see your RAM usage goes up. Hope this somewhat better helps you to understand computers <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Simples things, they are.</p>

<p>The first thing i want to  now is what does GHz mean and whats does RAM mean?</p>
<p>apparently my computer has 2.8GHz and504MB of RAM so what does that actually mean?</p>
