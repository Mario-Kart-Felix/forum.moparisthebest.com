    <title>[IDEA] New Game Using RS Base [IDEA]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/idea-new-game-using-rs-base-idea/426104</link>
    <description>Well, i bet everyone here has coded or played rsps for years. nothing really new or special. it gets boring after a while. 
 
After I was bored to death with the usual PI or Delta based leaches going around, nothing is usually new or exciting.
 
So I&#39;ve been comming up with ideas to make a fully new game using the RS base as a game engine. I would completely wipe the client, so that no tabs exist, and only the simple I/O functions. and delete EVERYTHING on the server. Also make new landscapes and (maby) models (or custom ones).
 
and yet, all of this will still keep that same 317 &#39;feel&#39; of the game, while also its not boring or a copy of a copy.
 
i dont think this has ever been done before, but i think its a great idea.
 
SO! tell me what you think about it. PLEASE NO FLAMMING! (Also, im not sure if this is the right section for this, cuz its not a set &#39;server&#39; but more of an idea.)
thx,
Daginith</description>
