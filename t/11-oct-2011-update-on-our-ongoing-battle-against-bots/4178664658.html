    <meta name="description" content="Dear RuneScape Community, 

I would like to take a moment of your time to address the highly emotive issue that we face as a community – bots.

<p>Perhaps Jagex might solve this problem by selling gp themselves? It prevents scamming, it gets rid of most of the bots and gives Jagex a new source of income. Perhaps they could also make it so that players can buy membership with gp, in order to prevent massive inflation caused by the ‘printing’ of money.</p>

<p>they wouldn’t do that, means the rich kids can just buy the best items… unfair if you are poor irl.<br>

Jagex should set up Sting gold selling operation then ban all the accounts purchase, this would set fear to anyone not wanting to risk an account from purchasing gold. Plus Jagex keeps purchase money[/quote]</p>

Yeah, that’s basically what I was trying to say. It would be illegal for jagex to tell people they are selling them a service of product and then not deliver.</p>

        <p>As usual Jagex are reassuring what legitimate players they have left. Interesting to know would be the amount of profit Jagex face to lose/gain if they did eradicate gold farmers, and whether bot subscriptions was covering their costs of fighting them. (Unfortunately not an accurately measurable statistic due to the fact Jagex still seem to have trouble identifying bots)</p>
<p>Asking the players for their observations of bots seems ridiculous and far from helpful, this is surely to make the players feel apart of something.</p>
<p>Muting spammers seems to be the only useful feature of a long winded post which basically amounts to them doing nothing.</p>
<p>EDIT: The suggestion of Jagex themselves putting up fake gold sites is interesting, whilst it would be illegal to sell gold then not deliver and just take money, I don’t see why they couldn’t take money for gold then simply deliver on the gold whilst banning the account shortly after. The implications of this could be devastating from a PR standpoint though.</p>
<p>Completely off topic but I find their introduction of “dice” to the game to be somewhat shooting themselves in the foot, in that they have created the environment for which gambling may take place and for one to gamble (after being cleaned out) an addict would see buying gold as an investment to future winnings. Of course the majority of them are just going to wind up buying more when they lose more, and buying more gold is always easier than grinding for it… especially with that little light in the back of their head telling them it’ll make them a fortune eventually. In my experience of Runescape staking, I found it very, very easy to exploit most users total lack of knowledge of the gambler’s fallacy. Encouraging them to staking twice as much each time they lose is somewhat trivial, and the hilarity of the situation is there are guides out there luring the into this mindset. Runescape will create gambling addicts by my reckoning, and with most players being unable to gamble real money legally, I sense buying virtual gold for dicing/staking is to many a brilliant (in their mind) alternative. Completely speculative, but I think… observable.</p>

<p>EDIT: The suggestion of Jagex themselves putting up fake gold sites is interesting, whilst it would be illegal to sell gold then not deliver and just take money, I don’t see why they couldn’t take money for gold then simply deliver on the gold whilst banning the account shortly after. The implications of this could be devastating from a PR standpoint though.</p>
<p>Completely off topic but I find their introduction of “dice” to the game to be somewhat shooting themselves in the foot, in that they have created the environment for which gambling may take place and for one to gamble (after being cleaned out) an addict would see buying gold as an investment to future winnings. Of course the majority of them are just going to wind up buying more when they lose more, and buying more gold is always easier than grinding for it… especially with that little light in the back of their head telling them it’ll make them a fortune eventually. In my experience of Runescape staking, I found it very, very easy to exploit most users total lack of knowledge of the gambler’s fallacy.

As usual Jagex are reassuring what legitimate players they have left.

<p>Completely off topic but I find their introduction of “dice” to the game to be somewhat shooting themselves in the foot, in that they have created the environment for which gambling may take place and for one to gamble (after being cleaned out) an addict would see buying gold as an investment to future winnings.

Encouraging them to staking twice as much each time they lose is somewhat trivial, and the hilarity of the situation is there are guides out there luring the into this mindset. Runescape will create gambling addicts by my reckoning, and with most players being unable to gamble real money legally, I sense buying virtual gold for dicing/staking is to many a brilliant (in their mind) alternative.

<p>I agree. The only useful part of this entire post was the auto muting.

This could simply be Jagex’s way of trying to rebuild their userbase so the financial impact of eradicating bots won’t be as devastating, additional to the moral support players will give them, thereby shunning out all future bots after Jagex releases their waves of attack.

        <p>It would be a logically inaccurate to compare RS’ metagame to other MMORPGs they do not share similar economic systems,  amongst many other things (release date, for instance is rather important - the internet is ever expanding so of course there is more RWT now then there was say 10 years ago in a different MMO). Interesting though, are you suggesting these other MMORPGs have means to gamble but no RWT? No conclusive link can be drawn between the two (because their wont be data to support such a thing) but I just imagine it to be one of the contributing factors that brings someone to buy RS gold.</p>
<p>As I said, I was speculating. I’m not completely agreeable with the idea myself but I think it could be a contributing factor even on a small scale.  For example, in RS a larger factor for RWT would be that levelling in many skills is completely buy-able, and the fastest levelling (to avoid the grind) is the most expensive, and thus many players will pay there way there.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Greeny, post:36, topic:417866”]It would be a logically inaccurate to compare RS’ metagame to other MMORPGs they do not share similar economic systems,  amongst many other things (release date, for instance is rather important - the internet is ever expanding so of course there is more RWT now then there was say 10 years ago in a different MMO). Interesting though, are you suggesting these other MMORPGs have means to gamble but no RWT? No conclusive link can be drawn between the two (because their wont be data to support such a thing) but I just imagine it to be one of the contributing factors that brings someone to buy RS gold.</p>
<p>As I said, I was speculating. I’m not completely agreeable with the idea myself but I think it could be a contributing factor even on a small scale.  For example, in RS a larger factor for RWT would be that levelling in many skills is completely buy-able, and the fastest levelling (to avoid the grind) is the most expensive, and thus many players will pay there way there.[/quote]Ultima Online was the same way. The difference however was that they never condemned the RWT as they just found it silly that anyone would choose to buy stuff for IRL cash.</p>
