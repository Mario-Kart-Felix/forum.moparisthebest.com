    <description>Dear RuneScape Community,

I would like to take a moment of your time to address the highly emotive issue that we face as a community – bots.

At the beginning of the year, when we brought Free Trade and the Wilderness back, we promised that we would couple that with programmes that would combat the inevitable botting that would result from that decision. Over the last few months we have initiated a number of programmes to do this, some of which we have already mentioned to you, some of which we haven’t because of legal reasons and some because we do not want to warn gold farmers and bot makers about our counter measures.

The challenge for us is that despite all of our programmes and best intentions the problem is still huge and, most annoyingly, still adversely impacting parts of our game.

We are continuing to battle bots on all fronts. In an effort to be more open and transparent we wish to share a couple of measures and initiatives we are about to release/have released recently:

    We have recently improved our internal systems to be able to spot spam from the chat window and instantly mute the offender preventing the constant flow of communication from the gold farmers which are impacting the game experience. Your reports are very helpful to us here!

    Continuing our ongoing legal cases against bot developers.

    Mandatory email validation for new accounts will add extra account security and impair the mass account creation that gold farmers use.

There are several other initiatives and actions that we plan to implement over the next few months and we will share these with you as often and in much detail as we can. The most significant of these is to come soon. Also, we recognise that we have not been the best at communicating what we are doing and that changes today.

While we are winning small battles by spending significant money and resources in trying to combat this problem, the war is not going in our favour as we are struggling to keep up with companies whose only business 24 hours a day 7 days a week is to find ways to get bots into the game. As a result, one thing has become really clear to us despite our ongoing efforts.

We cannot win this battle alone. We need your help.

So how can you help? First, we would like to hear from you in a more coordinated way regarding your thoughts about how to fight the bots problem. We will be developing surveys to help us understand more about bots directly from you... we would love to hear your response.

We would like to set up a special forum where we can have targeted Q&amp;A’s and get formal feedback from you about specific initiatives. We will let you know when this forum is set up and invite you to join us.

We hope that you will engage with and encourage your friends to use any tools that we provide to you that will help us identify and ban the bots like the Spam Filter feature.

And finally, we would ask that you refrain from using bots or supporting gold farmers. If there is not a market, then bots will not exist. As was so eloquently put in a recent post on Tip.it “Standing up to Jagex [by voicing one’s opinion on the botting issue], one might argue, requires a certain amount of courage, but much more is required to stand up to one’s friends”. The player went on to say, “The community needs to stand up for itself by following the rules and shunning those who do not. Lacking customers, the websites that set up the bots will close, and the only botter will be the isolated real player. Ultimately, following the three pillars of the code of conduct that Jagex set up-“Honour,” “Respect,” and “Security” are a responsibility of the players and the community as much as they are of Jagex.”

We are committed to ridding our game of bots. We are committed to providing a more open discussion with you about the real challenges that we face as a result of our efforts. We are committed to involving you more in this war so we can win this fight together.

Most importantly, we are committed to continuing our investment in evolving and making RuneScape a great game to play and an amazing community to be a part of.

Thanks,

Daniel Clough
Chief Operating Officer &amp; Vice President of RuneScape



So basically they have done nothing since free trade reopened.</description>

As usual Jagex are reassuring what legitimate players they have left. Interesting to know would be the amount of profit Jagex face to lose/gain if they did eradicate gold farmers, and whether bot subscriptions was covering their costs of fighting them. (Unfortunately not an accurately measurable statistic due to the fact Jagex still seem to have trouble identifying bots)</p>
<p>Asking the players for their observations of bots seems ridiculous and far from helpful, this is surely to make the players feel apart of something.</p>
<p>Muting spammers seems to be the only useful feature of a long winded post which basically amounts to them doing nothing.</p>
<p>EDIT: The suggestion of Jagex themselves putting up fake gold sites is interesting, whilst it would be illegal to sell gold then not deliver and just take money, I don’t see why they couldn’t take money for gold then simply deliver on the gold whilst banning the account shortly after. The implications of this could be devastating from a PR standpoint though.</p>
<p>Completely off topic but I find their introduction of “dice” to the game to be somewhat shooting themselves in the foot, in that they have created the environment for which gambling may take place and for one to gamble (after being cleaned out) an addict would see buying gold as an investment to future winnings. Of course the majority of them are just going to wind up buying more when they lose more, and buying more gold is always easier than grinding for it… especially with that little light in the back of their head telling them it’ll make them a fortune eventually. In my experience of Runescape staking, I found it very, very easy to exploit most users total lack of knowledge of the gambler’s fallacy. Encouraging them to staking twice as much each time they lose is somewhat trivial, and the hilarity of the situation is there are guides out there luring the into this mindset. Runescape will create gambling addicts by my reckoning, and with most players being unable to gamble real money legally, I sense buying virtual gold for dicing/staking is to many a brilliant (in their mind) alternative. Completely speculative, but I think… observable.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree. The only useful part of this entire post was the auto muting. I don’t yet have much of an opinion regarding the financial impacts bots have on Jagex’s business, but I do think it’s significant enough for Jagex to “buy time” by slowly releasing defenses, rather than all at once. It’s probably a better business strategy to try and legitimize as many players before actually taking out automated accounts. This could simply be Jagex’s way of trying to rebuild their userbase so the financial impact of eradicating bots won’t be as devastating, additional to the moral support players will give them, thereby shunning out all future bots after Jagex releases their waves of attack. Just a possibility.</p>
<p>As to the dicing thing, I think it’s a terrible thing for them as well. I don’t, however, think they planned it. It’s probably extremely stupid of them, but I really doubt they would have released something like “dicing” when they are putting so much effort toward getting rid of bots. Even young players can make the connection between dicing and RWT, and call Jagex a liar/hypocrite for caring so much about getting rid of bots, when they are internally supporting them via dicing. I think they just released dice as a means of settling disputes among members, especially in clans. Metagaming took its course again, however…[/quote]Clearly you suck, metagame is the best!</p>

<p>I agree. The only useful part of this entire post was the auto muting. I don’t yet have much of an opinion regarding the financial impacts bots have on Jagex’s business, but I do think it’s significant enough for Jagex to “buy time” by slowly releasing defenses, rather than all at once. It’s probably a better business strategy to try and legitimize as many players before actually taking out automated accounts. This could simply be Jagex’s way of trying to rebuild their userbase so the financial impact of eradicating bots won’t be as devastating, additional to the moral support players will give them, thereby shunning out all future bots after Jagex releases their waves of attack. Just a possibility.</p>
<p>As to the dicing thing, I think it’s a terrible thing for them as well. I don’t, however, think they planned it. It’s probably extremely stupid of them, but I really doubt they would have released something like “dicing” when they are putting so much effort toward getting rid of bots. Even young players can make the connection between dicing and RWT, and call Jagex a liar/hypocrite for caring so much about getting rid of bots, when they are internally supporting them via dicing. I think they just released dice as a means of settling disputes among members, especially in clans. Metagaming took its course again, however…</p>

              <p>As usual Jagex are reassuring what legitimate players they have left. Interesting to know would be the amount of profit Jagex face to lose/gain if they did eradicate gold farmers, and whether bot subscriptions was covering their costs of fighting them. (Unfortunately not an accurately measurable statistic due to the fact Jagex still seem to have trouble identifying bots)</p>
<p>Asking the players for their observations of bots seems ridiculous and far from helpful, this is surely to make the players feel apart of something.</p>
<p>Muting spammers seems to be the only useful feature of a long winded post which basically amounts to them doing nothing.</p>
<p>EDIT: The suggestion of Jagex themselves putting up fake gold sites is interesting, whilst it would be illegal to sell gold then not deliver and just take money, I don’t see why they couldn’t take money for gold then simply deliver on the gold whilst banning the account shortly after. The implications of this could be devastating from a PR standpoint though.</p>
<p>Completely off topic but I find their introduction of “dice” to the game to be somewhat shooting themselves in the foot, in that they have created the environment for which gambling may take place and for one to gamble (after being cleaned out) an addict would see buying gold as an investment to future winnings. Of course the majority of them are just going to wind up buying more when they lose more, and buying more gold is always easier than grinding for it… especially with that little light in the back of their head telling them it’ll make them a fortune eventually.

<p>Perhaps Jagex might solve this problem by selling gp themselves? It prevents scamming, it gets rid of most of the bots and gives Jagex a new source of income. Perhaps they could also make it so that players can buy membership with gp, in order to prevent massive inflation caused by the ‘printing’ of money.</p>

Yeah, I think it’s legal to do it in general, but Silab had mentioned keeping the purchase money - that’s where I think it might be called into question. In addition, if they were to take credit card/payment details at all, it might become dangerous ground legally.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t think it would be illegal. It’s like a bait car to the police. You’re not telling them to buy it, they’re buying it of their own volition.</p>
<p>Although it still might be, because they would be making money off of something that breaks their TOS. It’s like selling an official botting program, then banning them for using it.</p>

<p>As detection of bots gets better, the bots themselves get better at being undetectable. As Andrew Gower said in an interview a few years ago, there will come a day that they cannot identify who’s a bot, and who’s a player.</p>

              <p>Perhaps Jagex might solve this problem by selling gp themselfs? It would make scammers stop scamming. That is, if it isn’t overpriced. Also Jagex needs to make it where you can have certain amount of member days, according to how long they have been active.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">EXAMPLE:</span></span></span><br>
1 week = 2 days<br>
2 weeks = 4 days<br>
3 weeks = 6 days<br>
4 weeks = 8 days<br>

Dear RuneScape Community,</p>
<p>I would like to take a moment of your time to address the highly emotive issue that we face as a community – bots.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, when we brought Free Trade and the Wilderness back, we promised that we would couple that with programmes that would combat the inevitable botting that would result from that decision. Over the last few months we have initiated a number of programmes to do this, some of which we have already mentioned to you, <span class="bbcode-b">some of which we haven’t because of legal reasons</span> and some because we do not want to warn gold farmers and bot makers about our counter measures.[/quote]</p>
<p>Illegal activities to counter botting?[/quote]</p>
<p>Probably something to do with ongoing lawsuits etc</p>
