I would like to take a moment of your time to address the highly emotive issue that we face as a community – bots.

        <p>Dear RuneScape Community,</p>
<p>I would like to take a moment of your time to address the highly emotive issue that we face as a community – bots.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, when we brought Free Trade and the Wilderness back, we promised that we would couple that with programmes that would combat the inevitable botting that would result from that decision. Over the last few months we have initiated a number of programmes to do this, some of which we have already mentioned to you, some of which we haven’t because of legal reasons and some because we do not want to warn gold farmers and bot makers about our counter measures.</p>
<p>The challenge for us is that despite all of our programmes and best intentions the problem is still huge and, most annoyingly, still adversely impacting parts of our game.</p>
<p>We are continuing to battle bots on all fronts. In an effort to be more open and transparent we wish to share a couple of measures and initiatives we are about to release/have released recently:</p>
<pre><code>We have recently improved our internal systems to be able to spot spam from the chat window and instantly mute the offender preventing the constant flow of communication from the gold farmers which are impacting the game experience. Your reports are very helpful to us here!

Continuing our ongoing legal cases against bot developers.

Mandatory email validation for new accounts will add extra account security and impair the mass account creation that gold farmers use.
</code></pre>
<p>There are several other initiatives and actions that we plan to implement over the next few months and we will share these with you as often and in much detail as we can. The most significant of these is to come soon. Also, we recognise that we have not been the best at communicating what we are doing and that changes today.</p>
<p>While we are winning small battles by spending significant money and resources in trying to combat this problem, the war is not going in our favour as we are struggling to keep up with companies whose only business 24 hours a day 7 days a week is to find ways to get bots into the game. As a result, one thing has become really clear to us despite our ongoing efforts.</p>
<p>We cannot win this battle alone. We need your help.</p>
<p>So how can you help? First, we would like to hear from you in a more coordinated way regarding your thoughts about how to fight the bots problem. We will be developing surveys to help us understand more about bots directly from you… we would love to hear your response.</p>
<p>We would like to set up a special forum where we can have targeted Q&amp;A’s and get formal feedback from you about specific initiatives. We will let you know when this forum is set up and invite you to join us.</p>
<p>We hope that you will engage with and encourage your friends to use any tools that we provide to you that will help us identify and ban the bots like the Spam Filter feature.</p>
<p>And finally, we would ask that you refrain from using bots or supporting gold farmers. If there is not a market, then bots will not exist. As was so eloquently put in a recent post on Tip.it “Standing up to Jagex [by voicing one’s opinion on the botting issue], one might argue, requires a certain amount of courage, but much more is required to stand up to one’s friends”. The player went on to say, “The community needs to stand up for itself by following the rules and shunning those who do not. Lacking customers, the websites that set up the bots will close, and the only botter will be the isolated real player. Ultimately, following the three pillars of the code of conduct that Jagex set up-“Honour,” “Respect,” and “Security” are a responsibility of the players and the community as much as they are of Jagex.”</p>
<p>We are committed to ridding our game of bots. We are committed to providing a more open discussion with you about the real challenges that we face as a result of our efforts. We are committed to involving you more in this war so we can win this fight together.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we are committed to continuing our investment in evolving and making RuneScape a great game to play and an amazing community to be a part of.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Daniel Clough<br>
Chief Operating Officer &amp; Vice President of RuneScape</p>
<p>So basically they have done nothing since free trade reopened.</p>

        <p>I like how they make it look like they’re doing something when there is no actual ‘content’ in this message. It’s just reinforcing the players beliefs in them without actually accomplishing anything</p>
<p>Edit: I would like to add; the advertisement bots for gold sites in free to play are basically gone. You’ll rarely find any now, as there are almost always(24 hours a day) one or two Jagex mods hopping around muting them.</p>

<p>This bit kinda piqued my interest, I think Jagex is doing the wrong thing here.<br>
They’re trying to combat bots by disabling the methods they use, which is pretty much futile because people will always find a way around that.<br>
Rather than that, I think if they want to combat botting, they should look at the <span class="bbcode-b">cause</span> of botting.<br>
One of the reasons I’ve always botted is because I do want access to the more awesome content, but before you’re able to get there you need to spend such a long time it isn’t fun anymore.<br>
So, my 2 cents, they should improve the areas where people could possibly get bored (skilling, making money), rather than just trying to disable bots.</p>

</aside>
<p>How does this stop them? They can easily create masses of emails. Ya it slows the process a bit but they just do the same thing and then just go through the emails clicking validation links.</p>

<p>^total fallacy, only the bigger bot developers who depend on the market for website hosting and other funding would suffer.</p>

<span class="bbcode-b">And finally, we would ask that you refrain from using bots or supporting gold farmers. </span>If there is not a market, then bots will not exist. As was so eloquently put in a recent post on Tip.it “Standing up to Jagex [by voicing one’s opinion on the botting issue], one might argue, requires a certain amount of courage, but much more is required to stand up to one’s friends”. The player went on to say, “The community needs to stand up for itself by following the rules and shunning those who do not. Lacking customers, the websites that set up the bots will close, and the only botter will be the isolated real player. Ultimately, following the three pillars of the code of conduct that Jagex set up-“Honour,” “Respect,” and “Security” are a responsibility of the players and the community as much as they are of Jagex.”<br>
[/quote]<br>
This bit kinda piqued my interest, I think Jagex is doing the wrong thing here.<br>
They’re trying to combat bots by disabling the methods they use, which is pretty much futile because people will always find a way around that.<br>
Rather than that, I think if they want to combat botting, they should look at the <span class="bbcode-b">cause</span> of botting.<br>
One of the reasons I’ve always botted is because I do want access to the more awesome content, but before you’re able to get there you need to spend such a long time it isn’t fun anymore.<br>
So, my 2 cents, they should improve the areas where people could possibly get bored (skilling, making money), rather than just trying to disable bots.[/quote]</p>
<p>Couldn’t agree more with this statement.</p>

Perhaps Jagex might solve this problem by selling gp themselves? It prevents scamming, it gets rid of most of the bots and gives Jagex a new source of income. Perhaps they could also make it so that players can buy membership with gp, in order to prevent massive inflation caused by the ‘printing’ of money.<br>

Jagex should set up Sting gold selling operation then ban all the accounts purchase, this would set fear to anyone not wanting to risk an account from purchasing gold. Plus Jagex keeps purchase money</p>

Isn’t that illegal, though?</p>
<p>I agree that jagex should find ways to make the game less of a grind, however I don’t know how well received that change would be - I haven’t played in a while, but a lot of the people I used to play with complain constantly about how the recent changes have undermined the game. Although, that’s just a small minority of old players, perhaps others have a different view on the subject.</p>

<p>I’ve played a few MMORPGs over the years that sold in-game money, items and such, and it always completely ruins the game to the point where if you don’t have a LOT of money to spend on the game (and who with a life does?) you can’t get anywhere and it isn’t fun.  It would entirely ruin the game.</p>
<p>But yes, I agree this is pretty much just bullcrap to appease the masses, with the exception of the auto-muting filter, which is a great idea.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think it’s legal to do it in general, but Silab had mentioned keeping the purchase money - that’s where I think it might be called into question. In addition, if they were to take credit card/payment details at all, it might become dangerous ground legally.</p>

        <p>This is how Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize; “We haven’t done anything yet, but we’re working on it”.</p>
<p>As detection of bots gets better, the bots themselves get better at being undetectable. As Andrew Gower said in an interview a few years ago, there will come a day that they cannot identify who’s a bot, and who’s a player.</p>

Yeah, I think it’s legal to do it in general, but Silab had mentioned keeping the purchase money - that’s where I think it might be called into question. In addition, if they were to take credit card/payment details at all, it might become dangerous ground legally.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t think it would be illegal. It’s like a bait car to the police. You’re not telling them to buy it, they’re buying it of their own volition.</p>
<p>Although it still might be, because they would be making money off of something that breaks their TOS. It’s like selling an official botting program, then banning them for using it.</p>

I think the police have the legal power to do so though: they are an arm of the government and they are using it to stop law breakers. Meanwhile botting on runescape is not a crime afaik, and jagex is charging them for a service they are not giving.</p>

<p>Because without out some form of law enforcement, civilization would fall into chaos.</p>
<p>I suppose they could include a clause in the TOS “You can buy the bot/items for $X.YY, but in doing so, you agree that we may take actions against your account (ban, etc), and you will not receive a refund”.</p>
<p>Nobody reads it anyways, so they could slide it in there and most people wouldn’t notice. And if someone tries to complain, they could pull the whole “Read the fine print” card.</p>
