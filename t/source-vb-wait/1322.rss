    <title>[Source][VB] Wait</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/source-vb-wait/1322</link>
    <description>Well, in this post I&#39;m going to explain you the cons and the pros of 3 different Wait functions.

1st:
[code]Private Declare Sub Sleep Lib &quot;kernel32.dll&quot; (ByVal dwMilliseconds As Long)

Sub Wait(Time As Long)
    Sleep Time
End Function[/code]

+ This is pretty much 100% accurate.
- It freezes up your application mostly during the wait.

2nd:
[code]Sub Wait(Time As Long)
Dim a As Long
    For a = 1 to Time
        DoEvents
    Next a
End Sub[/code]

+ This doesn&#39;t freeze up your application.
- It influenced alot by your computer&#39;s speed.

3th:
[code]Private Declare Function timeGetTime Lib &quot;winmm.dll&quot; () As Long

Sub Wait(Time As Long)
Dim TimeNow As Long
    TimeNow = timeGetTime()
    Do
        DoEvents
    Loop While TimeNow + Time &gt; timeGetTime()
End Sub[/code]

+ This doesn&#39;t freeze your aplication.
- It&#39;s not 100% accurate.


Now for the best one, I&#39;d got nor the 3th, it isn&#39;t 100% accurate, but it&#39;s almost 100% accurate and not influenced by the computer&#39;s speed, also this doesn&#39;t freeze up the application like the first one.</description>
