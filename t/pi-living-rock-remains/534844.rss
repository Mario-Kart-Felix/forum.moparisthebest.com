    <title>[PI]Living Rock Remains</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-living-rock-remains/534844</link>
    <description>I am thinking about incorporating Living Rock creatures and having them turn into Living Rock Remains upon being killed. BUT I am not quite sure how I would go about making the Living Rock Remains spawning upon the death of a Living Rock creature.
Living Rock Remains are considered an NPC which is my main problem. 
Any tips or hints to push me in the right direction would be much appreciated. Thank you. :)

Server info:
The base is Krithium/Virtue which originated from PI.

If any other information is needed to help me out, let me know and I will respond ASAP. Thanks again.</description>

<p>Alright, I plan on giving it a go today so I will see how it turns out. I think I will do it with the spawnNPC that I have in NPCHandler, I just have to figure out exactly how it works since I have never really looked at it before.<br>
Thank you for the input. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
