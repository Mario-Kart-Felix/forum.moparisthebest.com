    <description>I just need some help with some bugs etc.. on my PI server im still in the learning process and the bugs shouldnt take that long please pm me or post here if interested. This is a PI server loading RS&#39;s newest items including dung items (no dung tho) but you can still buy them there is about 5 minigames one of the things i am looking into adding though is dicing since it is very popular. Max combat level is 138 since there is summoning and all familiars attack (in multi-zones) if you would like some more info before joining just pm me on here or go here and download the .jar client and play :). http://www.wix.com/beastlypker/home</description>
