    <title>Why do people hate Jewish people?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-do-people-hate-jewish-people/381801</link>
    <description>Was just wondering. They don&#39;t do anything to you, they live in great standards with excellent moral values and respect all others, but some reason a ton of people (including many Christians? Why would we hate a certain group of people - as the Lord proclaimed we should love everybody) hate them.

[b]This is [u]NOT[/u] a thread to post any stereotypical comments.[/b]

Also, I asked my Muslim acquaintance some questions.

[b]What would you do is Osama Bin Laden came into the room?[/b]
&quot;I&#39;d shake his hand because he&#39;s a Muslim.&quot; followed by discussion that he believes George W. Bush committed the terrorist attacks on September 11th and Bush just wanted to make Muslims hated.

[b]What would you do if a Jew asked you for money?[/b]
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t. They&#39;re all filthy stinky cheap idiots who don&#39;t give a **** about anyone besides their own kind.&quot;

[b]Why don&#39;t you support defending Israel?[/b]
&quot;They can go to hell. Why the **** would we kill arabs to defend a bunch of ******* Jews? They&#39;re all cheap ******** and they&#39;re the real terrorists!&quot;

Those are his exact words, as I copied down each response into my notebook.</description>

This, my friend, is an example of a Muslim who is too into his religion. I am a Muslim myself, and I know that Jews are people. History might or might not be against them, they are still human and should be treated as so. I have no problem with anybody opposing my religious views.</p>

<p>How can you be 1/3 jewish and 1/3rd german. One is a religion, one is a country.</p>
<p>You either follow the jewish religion or not. It’s not some gene that is passed down by your parents.</p>
<p>My mom is catholic, my dad was protestent. That doesn’t make me 1/2 catholic and 1/2 protestent. (Just felt like picking on you, I know what you meant)</p>

              <p>You are acting like this one person you interviewed is the representative for the entire Muslim faith. Those are one persons views, not all Muslims are american/jew hating extremists.</p>

I don’t give a fuck about anyones nationality, gender, sexual orientation etc, all I care about is their actions. And Osama Bin Laden is a violent person responsible for the death of innocent people. End of story, I do not like him. Don’t give a shit that he’s Muslim, I like Muslims just fine.</p>
<p>As for your actual questions of where all the hate and stereotypes come from, there’s many reasons.</p>
<p>These are the most common reasons I hear:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1)</span> They are frugal/cheap<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">2)</span> They hoard their money<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">3)</span> They have to much political power/money/wealth/success<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">4)</span> They believe they are better than everyone else<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">5)</span> DEY KILLED JESUS</p>
<p>There’s probably a ton more, but that’s generally along the lines of what I usually hear. These are where these stereotypes came from</p>
<p>First of all, being frugal is not even a bad thing, I do not really see why it is considered a negative characteristic. I can be very frugal with my money, it’s called being smart. Back in the day in places like Europe where Jews were always considered resident-aliens, subject to expulsion at the whim of the political class, it made sense to not have a career not tied to one location. In other words if a Jew was exiled he would want a job that was transferable to a new location. These jobs were usually ones that required intellectual/money handling skills. And when you have those types of skills, wealth and success usually happen, as well as favor with those in power politically. Many Jews became political advisors, which gave them influence and power. Also in Medieval times many governments restricted money handling and money lending to Jews and Arabs, believing them to be practices morally inappropriate for Christians. Entry into many fields was barred to Jews.</p>
<p>As for hoarding, knowing that you might be exiled or relocated at any moment meant that it made sense to have cash (gold) on you so that you could grab it at any moments notice. Also because they were so popularly resented, it made sense to keep your wealth a secret. You can see where the stereotype of Jews as cunning and opportunistic money handlers came from. And there actually were many successful Jewish doctors, bankers, lawyers, and teachers etc. But that doesn’t mean they all are successful.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the real source of why they are hated globally, it’s somewhat hard to say. Many people say it’s because they “killed Jesus” which is ridiculous considering Jesus was a Jew, so hating somebody because they are Jewish means you also hate Jesus. You could make the argument that the real source of it all is because of the ethnocentric nature of their faith, but I really don’t think there’s one main reason, just a combination of many.</p>

We gave Japan warnings, they don’t listen then we dropped a nuke on them, they still didn’t surrender, so we dropped a 2nd nuke on them.<br>
Osama gives the USA and other countrys warnings, so he bombs us when we don’t listen.<br>

<p>Christians hate Jewish people because they believe that they are the reason Jesus was crucified. When jesus was ‘on trial’ the people present, mostly jews, were asked by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontius_Pilate" data-bbcode="true">Pontus Pilate</a> weather jesus, the christian savior, or a murder (his name slips my memory) should be crucified. Pontius believed jesus to be a decent man and was ready to free him but the jews instead chose to save the murderer and have jesus crucified.</p>
<p>Obviously that is the version the christian bible tells and we can not prove or disprove that. Regardless of proof though christians have listened to it for centuries and persecuted jews because of it.</p>

and i don’t go around acting like i am better than anyone… but are you really telling me its not true? look at Israel, a very successful country compared to the regions around it. and yeah there’s other reasons obviously, such as ignorance, etc and honestly i am not religious and i do not like extremely orthodox Jews either, because in many cases they fit some of the stereotypes. but there’s stereotypes of every minority, its just part of human nature to be ignorant i guess…</p>
