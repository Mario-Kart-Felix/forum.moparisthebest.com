    <title>[More Staff] Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/more-staff-suggestion/149747</link>
    <description>Sorry to say, but I beleive there should be just Moparisthebest Staff, because when G-Mods are not on who else is going to moderate it? 

I suggest that because it came accross my mind, and I mean people who are very active on this side of the forums?

Lock if you want, please do not flame.

BTW I was thinking that some Community Members should be some.</description>

<p>On this forum? i would imagine you would need to be very patient.<br>
Since even i, and i’m not even staff get loads of pms each day off moparscapers asking me how to do something that is already plastered all over moparscape.<br>

              <p>Can some of you start declaring what you are meaning by the word ‘active’. Most of you are just talk, considering almost every staff member has posted in this topic already, even though you judge several of them inactive.</p>
<p>I don’t see what more staff will do for the site. Moparisthebest has always really been at a standstill in spam. MoparScape is getting a lot better and is staying that way. If you want a better and cleaner forum than this site, then you are wanting the impossible. You could have a hundred staff members, and these forums would still look the way they are. Large staff can just cause clutter and more issues anyway. I think that the current Global Mods and Admins are just fine the way they are.</p>

<p>Why? they earned that position, they are not given that position just to moderate the forums, they was given it because they deserve it.<br>
I’m pretty sure if you was given global moderator but then had to go away for a few months for whatever reason and you come back seeing that you had been de-modded, but was still offered that position if you wanted it, it would not make you feel very welcome :P.</p>
