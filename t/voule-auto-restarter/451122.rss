    <description>I am trying to use Voule Auto Restarter to restart my server every hour but whenever it tries to restart the server it opens another bat and says that the port is already in use.   It refuses to close the first one.

Looking around i found a few people with the same issue ranging from 1-2 years ago but the solutions werent very clear so if someone can give me some help fixing this it will be greatly appreciated.

This is what I see when I start the restarter:

[code]Voule Auto restart
&#39;tskill&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
Restarting server
Error: Unable to startup listener on 43594 - port already in use?[/code]

Thanks!  :D</description>
