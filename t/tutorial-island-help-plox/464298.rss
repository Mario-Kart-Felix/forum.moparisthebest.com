    <title>Tutorial Island Help Plox</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tutorial-island-help-plox/464298</link>
    <description>So, the problem sounds extremely easy, but it&#39;s not. I am using RuneSource, and was in the process of creating a tutorial island. I&#39;ve finished all my dialogues and what not, but when I try talking to the Runescape Guide on tutorial island, his dialogues won&#39;t show up, but rather the dialogue a man npc, or women npc, would say. If you have any idea how to fix this, please let me know... it&#39;s been a real ball-buster.</description>
