    <title>Experienced Server Operator: PLEASE HELP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/experienced-server-operator-please-help/48729</link>
    <description>I recently started a new server, and now I need assistance in opening the proper ports to allow others onto it. I have a Linksys router, and have tried going onto my router&#39;s ip and changing port forwarding so that port range 4000-5000 was open, but pple still can&#39;t get on. Anyone who can assist me and get it going can immediately have Admin status. If needed, reach me thru AIM. My s/n is Ub3r Hax3r. Thank you.[br][size=1]Posted on: January 17, 2007, 05:56:22 PM[/size][hr]bump[br][size=1]Posted on: January 17, 2007, 06:21:22 PM[/size][hr]bump</description>
