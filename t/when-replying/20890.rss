    <description>[b]Help[/b]

When replying to topic&#39;s it is unnecessary to reply saying things such as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yeah, i need help with this to!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just wait for somebody to reply to the topic. You are most likely doing this for post count. Post count means nothing, this is not like other forums. What counts here is Rep.

[b]Reputation[/b]

Also when posting it is inapproptiate to ask for Rep, most people will do this for the obvious reason (becoming a moderator).
