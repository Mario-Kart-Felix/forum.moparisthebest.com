              <p>Good job. I passed my grade 3 exam with a distinction grade.

I might try my luck at grade 4 this year or the next one, depending on several factors.</p>

<p>I would normally sing, but I instead started to learn piano in school this year. To be honest, I don’t like having to learn certain songs, I’d much rather pick my own and play them. I’ve actually been playing a bit from U.N.

</aside>
<p>I was like that to begin with and then my tutor kinda got to grips with what I like to play and started giving me pieces to learn that I enjoyed playing. I usually play something extremely easy to warm up haha either; The Fray - Never Say Never or Pachelbel’s Canon. They’re both  from very, very different times haha</p>

<p>a lot of people don’t if i’m being honest. I’ve only just came back to making RSPS websites and forums, I went away on other topics and other communities so I thought I’d join moparscape, I have to earn respect to be treated with it, it’s the cycle of big communities.</p>

<p>OT: Good Job. I used to play piano… But since I got to a Christian school, my teacher tried to get me to play more Christian music and I got kinda tired of it… She did give me some classical pieces to do but I got bored… I was actually thinking about getting a keyboard and starting up again (since they have more sounds then a piano…).[/quote]<br>
Thanks runewings, you should take it back up. I have a digital standing keyboard but I don’t use it much, I got a baby grand piano for christmas so I’ve basically not stopped playing that in the waking hours I’m not at college or doing coursework haha. I love playing baroque/classical, Pachelbel’s canon has to be a favourite even though it’s grade 3.</p>
