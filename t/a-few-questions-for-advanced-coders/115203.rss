    <description>[size=15pt]A few questions for advanced coders...[/size]

1: Attacking Error
l) OK, when I use a melee weapon and attack a player, it hits them. Then when they walk away, my character doesn&#39;t follow them and they still get damaged. My character doesn&#39;t move, and still they get damaged even if they are far away. Does anyone know how to solve this?

ll) [b]Sometimes[/b] when I click to attack somebody, it does the hitting emote but the other player doesn&#39;t get hit at all. I have to wait a few seconds then click on them again for it to attack properly. Why is this?

2: [s]Mage[/s]/Range NPC
How do I make an NPC attack with [s]mage or[/s] range instead of melee?

3: Anti-lag
I assume that you&#39;ve heard of [b]ZdiddyScape[/b]? Around a month ago, there was a poll on which server was the best. ZdiddyScape was ranked [b]1[/b]. That server, and all the other popular servers are lag-proof. Whenever I [b]mass click[/b] on training objects, such as dummies, on their server, it doesn&#39;t lag. My server lags when I do hat. The ZdiddyScape owner said that there is no anti-lag code. He told me to just base my training on NPCs. A few people told me to add timers - but I already have actionTimer in the object case. Others said they saw a tutorial on how to make it lag-proof, but they won&#39;t give me the link. Just want to ask if there is a code that makes it anti-lag, and what the link to the tutorial is.</description>

              <p>no nirvana its not usage of timers. I know that caused I helped zdiddy with it. If you notice his source doesn’t have a boolean process. Thats half of it, also to make a npc mage you have to make the animation or gfx attacking with mage.</p>
