    <description>[size=15pt]A few questions for advanced coders...[/size]

1: Attacking Error
OK, when I use a melee weapon and attack a player, it hits them. Then when they walk away, my character doesn&#39;t follow them and they still get damaged. My character doesn&#39;t move, and still they get damaged even if they are far away. Does anyone know how to solve this?

2: Port-forwarding
I did everything I need in order to port-forward. Still, nobody can log into my server. I set the variables. I added port to firewall exceptions. How can I solve it?

3: Mage/Range NPC
How do I make an NPC attack with mage or range instead of melee?

4: Anti-lag
I assume that you&#39;ve heard of [b]ZdiddyScape[/b]? Around a month ago, there was a poll on which server was the best. ZdiddyScape was ranked [b]1[/b]. That server, and all the other popular servers are lag-proof. Whenever I [b]mass click[/b] on training objects, such as dummies, on their server, it doesn&#39;t lag. My server lags when I do hat. The ZdiddyScape owner said that there is no anti-lag code. He told me to just base my training on NPCs. A few people told me to add timers - but I already have actionTimer in the object case. Others said they saw a tutorial on how to make it lag-proof, but they won&#39;t give me the link. Just want to ask if there is a code that makes it anti-lag, and what the link to the tutorial is.</description>
