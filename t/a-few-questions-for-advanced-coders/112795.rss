    <description>[size=15pt]A few questions for advanced coders...[/size]

1: Bow Damage
[s]OK, when I equip full torag with a C Bow, I hit 40&#39;s and 50s. When I equip good ranger gear, I can only do up to 20. When I equip ranger gear, it has higher range attack bonus and still, I do very little compared to full torags (and any other strong melee armour). How can I solve this?[/s]

2: Port-forwarding
I did everything I need in order to port-forward. Still, nobody can log into my server. I set the variables. I added port to firewall exceptions. How can I solve it?

3: Arrow Gfx
I did Palidino76&#39;s [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,128498.0.html]Range Projectiles[/url] for the arrow animation of normal bows and Crystal Bow. He made it so when I attack an NPC or a player, the arrow goes towards them. Read his tutorial first, and you&#39;ll know what I&#39;m talking about in this question. When I attack an NPC, the arrow goes straight at it. When I attack a player, nothing happens, no gfx. I did his whole tutorial, and the gfx for arrows on players didn&#39;t work. Does anybody know why?

4: Anti-lag
I assume that you&#39;ve heard of ZdiddyScape? Around a month ago, there was a poll on which server was the best. ZdiddyScape was ranked 1. That server, and all the other popular servers have a special anti-lag code. Whenever I mass click on training objects, such as dummies, on their server, it doesn&#39;t lag. My server lags when I do hat. What&#39;s the code or link to a tutorial that solves this problem? I already have actionTimer in my training cases.</description>

<p>Well it’s not that kind of lag that you’re thinking of. I have 1GB ram. It’s when I mass click it lags, uhh like when I try to move somewhere else while mass clicking on dummies it doesn’t move and sometimes says “connection lost”.</p>

<p>Maybe it goes off my strength bonus hmm, well how do I set it to range bonus? I told you, I have port forwarded, I’ve already been to that site and followed the instructions. Can you please post the link to the lag fre tutorial? I can’t find any… I’ve searched…</p>

I assume that you’ve heard of ZdiddyScape? Around a month ago, there was a poll on which server was the best. ZdiddyScape was ranked 1. That server, and all the other popular servers have a special anti-lag code. Whenever I mass click on training objects, such as dummies, on their server, it doesn’t lag. My server lags when I do hat. What’s the code or link to a tutorial that solves this problem? I already have actionTimer in my training cases.</p>
