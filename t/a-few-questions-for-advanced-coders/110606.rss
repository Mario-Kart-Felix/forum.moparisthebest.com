    <description>[size=15pt]A few questions for advanced coders...[/size]

1: Item Level Requirements
OK, when I equip a dragon scimitar, on my server, I need 60 attack. When I equip a halberd, I need 60 [b]defence[/b]. IDK how that was possible. How can I solve it?

2: Port-forwarding
I did everything I need in order to port-forward. Still, nobody can log into my server. How can I solve it?

3: Ranging
I did Dell&#39;s [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,96713.0.html]Full Range[/url] tutorial, for the working of arrows dropping. I did Palidino76&#39;s [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,128498.0.html]Range Projectiles[/url] for the arrow animation of normal bows and Crystal Bow. When I attack something, the arrow only appears once. Then it&#39;s gone. It doesn&#39;t continue, unless I click on the npc/player again. How can I solve this?</description>

              <p>Well, I have part of the ranging sorted. Now I can see the arrows continuously.</p>
<p>For <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,128498.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Range Projectiles</a>, attacking players won’t work. Please read it, and you’ll know what I’m talking about. The person who made the tutorial gave us a code for the arrow going towards the enemy. When I attack a NPC, it goes towards the enemy. When I attack a player though, it doesn’t make any gfx at all. That person gave us the code for attacking players. It didn’t seem to work though. Can anyone solve it?</p>

              <p>[quote=“luke12345, post:4, topic:110613”]for one i said that if you have done the level requirements of armor and weapons then its you doing something wrong because mines works fine.</p>
<p>aswell i did not say you had to get a new source i just said redownload your clients again or use a different one.</p>
<p>and i know you did not say that you were good at coding but its the way you answered me i was just trying to help you because you need it and i new a few things that i had done myself and you just spoke to me like i was an idiot and that i new sod all of what i was talking about.</p>
<p>and the arrows part i have to do that myself on my own server but i was only trying to help you know.</p>
<p>so im sorry if im not the best coder in the world but really come on its coding runescape here not many good coders are going to waste time doing this so stop mouning and just be nise and loads of people will help you and in the end you will get your problems solved its just a matter of time.</p>

<p>Youre probably referring to my <span class="bbcode-b">first</span> reply to your post. Sorry if it has offended you, but it was completely useless.</p>

              <p>[quote=“luke12345, post:3, topic:110613”]well on the armor lvl 1 u cutn have coz i have just changed then to double check and it works fyn so its you doin sumat wrong then are you compiling them or just saving them???</p>
<p>get a new client then yours dodgy.</p>
<p>and im not 100% sure how to the arrows but i bet its one of them.</p>
<p>and if your that good at coding then how come you cannot do this stuff yourself???<br>
luke[/quote]</p>
<p>Please give a quote, from me, explaining what I said that makes you think I said that I was so good at coding. Please use proper grammar and spelling; O can hardly understand what you’re saying. And no, I’m not getting another client or source.</p>

<p>LOL, can <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> do that for me? Or don’t you even know 1 bit of coding? Basically what you said is shit. Anyone can figure out the ways to solve it, but they don’t know <span class="bbcode-b">how</span>. Do you understand?</p>
