<p>Yes, my laptop is from 01 or 02, so leave it at that, it really boosted its performance. Sorry if you don’t see how.</p>
<p>Also, this CAN speed up your computer OR SLOW it down. It just depends on your computer. Just because something like this doesnt work for you, does not mean it wont for others. It worked for me, and 2 of my friends. Also a few others that posted in my thread about it.</p>

<p>Virtual Memory serves the same purpose as RAM. When needed, RAM, and Vitual Memory are used as external memory, so the hard-drive is not needed to be used as it is a slower method.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/fantom">@fantom</a> - My computer wont even play RS until i added this extra Virtual Memory to it, so i know how you feel.[/quote]<br>
Neither is used as ‘external memory’, unless your using USB and even that is slower than using your hard drive for Virtual memory.<br>
Virtual memory is based off the hard-disk until you specify it as otherwise.<br>
The read and write speed of RAM is much faster than the hard-disk thus when you set up Virtual Memory it’s slower than Physical RAM.<br>
Your computer also uses RAM and Virtual memory for different things when it comes to memory but you probably wouldn’t understand that.<br>
And your computer won’t play RS until you add more Virtual Memory because JAVA IS A VIRTUAL MACHINE and uses a lot of page space.</p>
<p>So please stop treating RAM and Virtual Memory as the same thing and perhaps do some research on it and you will see I am not just typing this to make you look stupid.</p>
