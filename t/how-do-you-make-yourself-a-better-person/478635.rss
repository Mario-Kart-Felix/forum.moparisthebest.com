    <title>How do you make yourself a better person?</title>

    <description>This is not in relation to the locked topic below.

How do you as an individual make yourself better? How do you help others? How do you help yourself?

This topic is also a place to show off any life achievements you have accomplished. Anything within reason is acceptable.


Ok, so i try and make myself a better person by doing charity work. I have raised over £200 as an individual over the past two years. That may not sound like a lot, but i feel as if i&#39;m helping somebody out there. I feel as if i play my part in helping others.

My current main individual achievement is playing with my band in a pub - which again doesn&#39;t sound like a lot, but to me, this was a major achievement. I play guitar, and recently i mastered alternative picking. I knew how to do it before, but i really got my fingers perfect now. Another achievement in my eyes.

Go on. Post. Be self indulged. Tell us about yourself.</description>
