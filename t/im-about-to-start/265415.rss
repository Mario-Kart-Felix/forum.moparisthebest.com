    <description>Hello all I need some advice, please explain me, i want to do my version of runescape, but i dont understand alot. First is that im looking for a fresh nice template of empty game which would be ready to be edited, coz i download for eg homiescape, and i press run a server but the there is no client to play, so i thought that someone could do a normal one just with 3 things the way it used to be, complier run and play. Thanks and there is new runescape hd so does anyone achieved it yet? By the way i came bact to mopar i was here few years ago just looking around. Now my knowledge improved and I want to do something.</description>
