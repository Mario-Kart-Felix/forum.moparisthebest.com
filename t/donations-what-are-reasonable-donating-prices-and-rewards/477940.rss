              <p>Personally, how we set up the current ‘donations’ isn’t really considered a donation, in my opinion. When you donate for a cause, you aren’t donating for the item, you are donating to help. When you put rewards up there, such as spins on a SoF, party hats, etc, that’s just giving the user a change to get ahead of the game, something RuneScape has done wrong now-a-days. In RuneScape you can buy spins, get free XP, and level up using the lamps won, and use money earned to buy items for skills and so on. RuneScape doesn’t call it donating though, they tell you to buy spins. That is essentially what you are doing with your server. You are selling items to users for the upkeep of the server. Just like the RuneScape market outside of the actual game.</p>
<p>I think you should set up a cosmetic donation system, if any. Meaning you give them items that are unique and not tradeable, Also making sure they don’t give an advantage over other players overall. Adding a timed xp boost, or PvM rewards, is a good idea, as long as you don’t over power it. Double XP rings are a big mistake in servers, because they are generally sold for about $15, and the player would be maxed on your server in a week. Then they stop playing, and stop donating. Say that happens to 75% of your players. Well, now how are you going to pay for the server since only 5 people play.</p>
<p>It’s really up to you how you setup a donation system and what items you give out, but don’t make it so it kills your server.</p>

I think a set list of items should be able to be obtained through donations however I think the best option for your server is to offer abilities i.e. 1.5x xp, access to unqiue bosses, better drop rates by 1.25x and so on. The better the abilities = the better the donation.<br>

</aside>
<p>Let me revise what I originally meant; a good idea (in my opinion), would be allowing donators to have early access to content. This doesn’t mean they have a zone or even a world to themselves, because that is ridiculous. Having a balanced system for this is obvious going to take a lot of thinking and ruling out. Also, in regards to your opinion about these ‘zones’ making donators immature, I’m pretty sure it is just the person that is immature. I don’t agree with zones either, because all content should be available to everyone at some point or another, but there are a limited set of rewards you can offer people that donate while also preserving the economy and community.</p>
