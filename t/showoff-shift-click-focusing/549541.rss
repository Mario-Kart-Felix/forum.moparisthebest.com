    <title>[SHOWOFF] Shift-click focusing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/showoff-shift-click-focusing/549541</link>
    <description>Yesterday, [url=http://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/2u7tjs/suggestion_a_solution_that_may_eliminate_common/]Reddit user ColossusRage made a suggestion to eliminate misclicks[/url]. The suggestion involved holding a hotkey that would prevent walking and only allow interactions (clicking NPCs, objects, etc).

I decided to attempt an implementation of this in the 317refactor client, and it was much easier than I thought. Find the video below.

              <p>i like the idea… but by the time you mis-click you probably won’t even use this function/it will be too late.</p>

<p>Let’s say you’re on the left hand side of a monster, you attempt to click on the monster but it moves and you click on the other side of it. You then will run around to the other side of the monster. This will prevent that.</p>

              <p>Looks like a fun addition but I can’t believe anybody would ever use it due to the fact they are simply not used to it<br>
as well as that there is no real reason why to use it. I have never been annoyed by a miss click or anything personally <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
