    <description>Hey guys i have a server, and a friend helped me on my last one, i finished the server, it&#39;s just when ever me or my friends go on, they cant walk well, it&#39;s very laggy and takes awhile to walk, im pretty sure it has something to do with me connecting through my ip then back to my router.. something about the &quot;localhost&quot; or the servers ip.. if you no what im failing on let me no, if you don&#39;t understand tell me what you dont get and i&#39;ll make it into better wording. lol thanks guys</description>
