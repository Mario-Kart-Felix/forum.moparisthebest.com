If you save them both and look at them through Windows you will see that they both appear to be transparent. If you open them in Paint they both have the default white background.

However, if you open them both in Photoshop you will see the first image has a black background and the second image has a transparent background.

Now the second image is causing problems, PHP doesn&#39;t like it and I can&#39;t get it to be properly transparent for anything... So what&#39;s the difference between the two files? How can I get the second PNG to be like the first PNG? There&#39;s something different in how they were generated or a setting within PNG but I can&#39;t figure out what it is.</description>

              <p>Cant you just do color to alpha and do black so that it will take the black away? I know you can do that in GIMP but idk what it’s called in photoshop.</p>

<p>Nope, it’s some weird PNG thing. If I make the other background black and save it, it is actually black and shows black in Paint, Windows, PHP, etc. I somehow need to copy how the first one was saved or generated. There’s a difference between the two.[/quote]<br>
if its PNG? try JPEG? or GIF? lol</p>

<p>When you dump them with the sprite editor they have the black background. So just grab another sprite from the client and it should be resolved.</p>
<p>As for the reason why I am guessing how the picture was saved.</p>
