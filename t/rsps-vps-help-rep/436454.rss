    <title>RSPS VPS Help [Rep++]</title>

    <description>Hey, I recently purchased a Windows 2008 VPS, and I was curious on how to configure the firewall settings to enable my server to be online. When I go to run my custom No-IP, it says, &quot;error connecting to server.&quot; on my No-IP DUC. I&#39;m not looking to run my server off of my VPS IP address to protect my server from DDoS attacks, so I want to use my custom No-IP; so could someone walk me through the steps to set this up?

Thanks,

Anthony</description>
