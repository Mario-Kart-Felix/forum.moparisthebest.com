    <title>Stork and I made sweet love</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stork-and-i-made-sweet-love/421312</link>
    <description>Stork&#39;s friend dropped out of going to a conference in Brighton so I decided to fill in as my family home is 20 miles from Brighton!

I met him last night and we drank for a bit then went to the beach to smoke marijuana. Stork had some coconut beer too it was awesome. Then we tried walking back to the town center and we went up some random road and almost got hit by a car it was coming straight for us. Then we went through a magical tunnel and ended up in some crazy lit up cavern with a fountain and shit. Next thing we know we are in exactly the same spot we&#39;d walked past 10 minutes ago. We finally got our bearings and parted ways.

Next morning we met up to go to the conference. http://2011.full-frontal.org/ is the link. It was amazing we got free coffee and free stickers and free pens and free sweets and free cupcakes. There was about 8 speakers in total lasting from 9am until about 5pm. The last two speakers I think were best as the first one was hilarious and the second one worked for google on the google doodles. Was extremely fascinating and well worth me skipping my lectures for. There was also a very interesting speaker from cloud9 (http://c9.io/), I&#39;ve never heard of it before but it&#39;s a web based IDE and it looks so damned good.

I&#39;ve been having a shit time with the shite I am being taught at university doing computer science, it was such a relief to listen to people in the real industry talk about what they love. I learned more in those few hours than I have done in my entire year and a half at uni.

The real great part was at the end of the conference. We already knew that there was an after party at a bar in town however we were not prepared when we were told all drinks were free! We got there and met quite a few other people in the computing industry, even got to chat to the google guy for a brief bit. There is nothing better tasting than a free bottle of fruit cider whilst brushing shoulders with people who are practically famous in the computing world.

Sadly we pretty much wasted the free alcohol experience as after about 4 pints we were trashed. Stork hadn&#39;t slept much and neither had I. 

I am waiting for the impending handover.

Stork had to go meet his irish friends so he could secure a floor to sleep on over night and we parted ways... Will we meet again? Who knows. 

5/5 stars would definitely date again.


p.s. I didn&#39;t really take any good pictures, I have a few of stork trying to play space invaders in a pub and one or two of the conference but that&#39;s about it and nothing worth really looking at so sorry no pics 4 u

tl;dr: me and stork met and went to an awesome conference and then got free alcohol</description>
