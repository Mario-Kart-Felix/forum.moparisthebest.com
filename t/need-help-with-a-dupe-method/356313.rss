    <title>~~ need help with a dupe method ~~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-a-dupe-method/356313</link>
    <description>ok i have fixed alot of dupe methods but i heard a new 1 and its not patched on my server!

the dupe that i need help fixing is the dupe when 2 players are in wild and 1 is skulled and right when the skulled dies then u log and it dupes everything.

so im thinking the way to stop this is to make it so when a player dies and is under att and logs out they automatically die.

any 1 have any ideas or fixes for this?</description>
