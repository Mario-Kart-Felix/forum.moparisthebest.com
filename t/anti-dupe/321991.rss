    <title>Anti-Dupe</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anti-dupe/321991</link>
    <description>People are doing trade dupe on my server.
Duping the most valuable items, and giving them out, personally, I cannot take it anymore.
So I want to know if anyone is kind enough to help me add a working anti-dupe to get rid of them once and for all.(Also, at some points when they dupe my server nulls)

My base is Delta 317. If that makes any difference.</description>
