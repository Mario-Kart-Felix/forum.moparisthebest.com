[SIZE=2]Tavlonia is a RuneScape Private Server hosted on an extremely stable, large and expensive dedicated server to ensure maximum enjoyment for our players. This is what makes Tavlonia such an amazing lagg free MMORPG to maximise the quality of gameplay for our PKers. At Tavlonia, PKing is our main feature and speciality. Our flawless switching and high quality HD resolution helps to encourage our best PKers to shine through! However, Tavlonia is not only based around PKing - To ensure that all of our players and to reach a wider range of players, we have created epic PvM and skilling systems. We have every main boss that Runescape and other RSPS&#39;s have BUT we have also created our own cusstom bosses which drop some of our UNIQUE custom Tavlonia items. These Items can also be obtained through donations. 
Tavlonia is a game created by gamers, for gamers. We ensure that whatever you suggest on our forums (within reason) gets added successfully to our server. We, unlike every other runescape private server, we listen to our players as they are of extreme importance.[/SIZE]

[SIZE=2]Let us begin to see an insight of what gaming at Tavlonia is like:[/SIZE]
[SIZE=3][COLOR=&quot;#FF0000&quot;]
Player VS Player (PvP) Combat[/COLOR]
[/SIZE]
[SIZE=2]For beginner PKers, we have a spawn tab of which they can choose FOR FREE a Melee Set, Hybrid Set, Mage Set, Range Set, Pure Set and ::Food!
[/SIZE]
                                                                                      [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/izoORSo.png[/img]


[SIZE=2]PvP at Tavlonia is our main speciality. We encourage our gamers to PK as much as possible, and that is why you will find PKing at Tavlonia is probably the most Advanced type of PKing you will find on a Runescape Private Server. Not only do we have so many various PK areas (Including: Safe PvP (Do not Lose Items), High Risk PK (Minimum of 50m to enter), Multi PvP and Single PvP). But we also have unique features such as a unique[COLOR=&quot;#00FF00&quot;] KILLSTREAK system [/COLOR] where if a successful PKer kills many people in a row, he will obtain a killstreak which will be announced to players. He will therefore, gain more PvP Tokens and More GP per kill! However, a PKer with a killstreak is also worth more money to other players. He will become a bounty target to everyone online! Therefore, if you kill somebody who is a bounty, you will receive more rewards for your kill!
