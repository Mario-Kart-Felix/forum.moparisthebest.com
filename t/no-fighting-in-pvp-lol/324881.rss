    <title>No fighting in PVP, LOL!</title>

    <description>Hey, here&#39;s my issue.

I have this 517 client, named Abbyscap3, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s familiar to most of you guys, however, here&#39;s my problem...

In PVP or BH or anywhere in the wilderness, no one can attack anyone. I can only use magic on people, but, not melee (not sure about range). Does anyone know how to add the attack option so people can actually fight via melee and range?

Please, keep in mind..the &quot;Attack Soandso&quot; when you right click on the person&#39;s name is there...it just doesn&#39;t attack unless if you use barrage on the person.

Is there a way to enable melee?</description>
