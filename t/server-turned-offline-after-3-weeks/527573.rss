    <title>Server turned offline after 3 weeks</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-turned-offline-after-3-weeks/527573</link>
    <description>Hee,

I have a server, wich i had online here on moparscape, and this morning..
I was looking through the serverstatus because my brother suddenly could not join my server anymore.
I dont know what the problem is, and maybe one of you guys have a solution.

I have not changed anything..
Port = open, Server = running.. everything is still the same as when is was online.

Need help badly please.

WhiteSanta

Also, tried on my brothers computer. Same problem..
It has Always worked.. untill this morning, and i did not changed anything :/

**SOLUTION**
[color=blue]Well, The router is resetted and restarted and the port is succesfully open now[/color]

[color=red]*When the connection is refused at canyouseeme.org , Just reset and restart the router, and open your ports again, then it wi&#39;ll works like it used to be.[/color]</description>

<p>OP: Try making sure your server is not running and then go to <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a>, test 43594, and check what the message says, it <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> say that the connection timed out.

Possible solutions:<br>
Restart your computer.<br>
Undo, and redo your port forwarding.<br>
Make sure <span class="bbcode-b">all</span> your IPs are the same. That means your local IP (192.168.x.x) and your broadcast ID (Mine starts with 9x.xx).<br>
Double check all firewalls, port blocks etc.<br>
Check to see if any other program may be taking over the ports.</p>
<p>Again, these are <span class="bbcode-i">possible</span> solutions. None are guaranteed to work.</p>
<p>Also, in the past I’ve had issues with port forwarding, and then I used <a href="http://simpleportforwarding.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this program</a> and it port forwarded for me properly (I did everything it did, but it apparently did it correctly xD).<br>

<p>As stated earlier, I don’t know if you have tried this, but are you sure it’s connecting to your local IP address? In the picture you posted of the port-forwarding interface on your router, it said that the local IPs were 192.168.1.(NOTHING) I’m not sure how your router is set up but every router I’ve worked with, when port-forwarding, there is usually a number in that place, I’m not sure what it means in your scenario that there isn’t. It should read ‘192.168.1.14’ for example, which is the local IP for your computer. To get your local IP go to Start &gt; Run… &gt; cmd, in the black box type, ‘ipconfig’.</p>

<p>The reason it’s missing the fourth, is because he used paint and covered/deleted it.<br>
Because we can totally hack your LAN ip.</p>

The only way we can really figure it out is to team view you. There should be no reason something is auddenly blocking it. If you don’t want us to team view you there is an alternative though. Try using another port :o</p>
