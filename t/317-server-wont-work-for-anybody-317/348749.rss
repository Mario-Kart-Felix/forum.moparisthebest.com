              <p>I have the same problem, I had a working webclient were people could connect but I somehow I managed to corrupt it so I remade it and now people can’t connect to my server anymore (they can download cache and stuff though, so only connecting is the problem) . Just like you it works for myself if I change ip to localhost.</p>
<p>Can someone help us? I have no idea what’s wrong…</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Lord_fear helped me find what the problem was (at least for me) It was that my port was set to my IP but when my router was unplugged or reset my IP was changed. I opened up my portforwarding settings page and changed the IP and my client worked again <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Hope this was your problem to and that this helps you to.</p>
