    <title>[PI] Webclient Already done but NEED HELP TO CHANGE</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-webclient-already-done-but-need-help-to-change/409783</link>
    <description>Hi,

I currently have a webclient up where a mate of mine helped me with and he gave me this link:

http://webclientjars.webs.com/Jars/%5BPI%5Dloader.jar

Once I had put that into a code and made it into a BBCode on my forum it looked like this:

[code=java]&lt;applet name=client width=765 height=503 archive=&#39;http://webclientjars.webs.com/Jars/%5BPI%5Dloader.jar&#39; code=&#39;client.class&#39;&gt;
&lt;PARAM name=&#39;java_arguments&#39; value=&#39;-Xmx700m&#39;&gt;
&lt;PARAM name=&#39;server_name&#39; value=&#39;UniqueScape&#39;&gt;
&lt;PARAM name=&#39;detail&#39; value=&#39;low&#39;&gt;
&lt;PARAM name=&#39;ip&#39; value=&#39;beastmode2.no-ip.org&#39;&gt;
&lt;PARAM name=&#39;port&#39; value=&#39;43594&#39;&gt;
&lt;PARAM name=&#39;background_image&#39; value=&#39;http://i53.tinypic.com/fei4oy.jpg&#39;&gt;
&lt;PARAM name=&#39;headicons&#39; value=&#39;&#39;&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
[/code]

BUT now I&#39;ve made some changes in my client that I&#39;d like to see happening in the WebClient so I figured I&#39;d have to change the earlier download link with a new link that downloads the actual client that I&#39;m working with now.. Make sense right?

SO I&#39;ve jarred my client using this guide: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiDQ7igB6fk (i&#39;ve seen a few others I think its right) and I now have a file Client with a type as &quot;executable jar file&quot; which I think is the file I&#39;m needing.

BUT NOW how do I get that file into a automatic download link that I can put in the code from above ^ so it&#39;ll swap clients.

If anyone knows this it&#39;d be a huge help and relieve and I&#39;ll rep you :).

Thank you very much.</description>

<p>Upload the new client somewhere. (I use <a href="http://dropbox.com" rel="nofollow noopener">dropbox.com</a>) and copy the link and paste it where I put “CHANGE THIS”</p>
