    <description>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve posted in the website development section, but, here I am. I took a looong leave on the &#39;technology world&#39; and it felt good, and helped me realize a lot of things. But, I&#39;m back, and here&#39;s my first project/release since. A lot of people want a price guide to help their economy for private servers, and Zybez does a wonderful job on doing so, except it does so for Runescape 2007. So hey, why not bring it to private servers for everyone to enjoy? For those of you who don&#39;t know what Zybez is, it&#39;s a Runescape help site. They did a wonderful job on having a price guide that anyone can post on, for others to read, and contact them to buy their item. It&#39;s an amazing system, so I figured I would work on bringing it to the RSPS world, for all to use. If you want to look at a live view of Zybez&#39;s Price Guide, go here: [url=http://forums.zybez.net/runescape-2007-prices]http://forums.zybez.net/runescape-2007-prices[/url] Thanks everyone, let me know what you think of the idea.

To do:
[code]- Get HTML/CSS/Images *DONE*
- Clean HTML/CSS *DONE*
- Start on some of the base PHP scripts and databases *DONE*
- Create scripts to calculate average buy/sell value of an item
- Add base items most commonly sold on private servers
- Link images from items
- Possibly create graphs
- Administration page to collect data on most purchased item, etc.
[/code]

Update Log:
[code][08/08/2013;8:51am] - Working on cleaning the HTML/CSS and other un-needed parts of the site.
[08/08/2013;9:47am] - I&#39;ve finished cleaning the HTML and CSS, now working on importing images, then PHP.
[08/08/2013;11:12am] - Just finished setting up the databases and tables, with columns and rows. Made it so that when you go to view a specific item, it reads information from the database. And accurately displays past offers. Next is working on display average sell, buy, etc. [/code]
[size=14pt]Images[/size]

[08/08/2013;9:47am] - Everywhere you see &#39;server&#39; can be changed in settings.php to your server name.

<p>Thanks for backing me up. Come release day, I’m going to have two downloads, one including the Zybes stylesheets and layout, and one with it all stripped.</p>

<p>We should all stop complaining, especially while he doesn’t have any server sided code working.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>How can you say I don’t have any server sided code working? Do you mean server-sided in terms of PHP or SQL? If that’s the case, I’ve got plenty done. It’s reading the items from the database, calculating averages perfectly, displaying top 10 recent offers, and a few more scripts.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re talking about server-sided in terms on Java, this doesn’t require any.</li>
</ul>
<p>** For all of those who are complaining about me not using my own design, I’ll scratch the Zybez design and release just the PHP/SQL with minimal HTML/CSS. It’ll be very simple so people can easily add it to their website’s theme. A simple PHP call to a function in the location you want it, and you’re done. For example:</p>
<p>To call the item search:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Code for itemSearch function:</p>
<p><code>function itemSearch() {
	//PHP code to display the item search bar. 
}</code></p>
<p>I will have other functions for different things as well.</p>
<p><code>getRecent(); - Gets the 10 most recent purchases.
newOffer(); - Displays the form to make a new offer.
playerOffers($playerName); - Shows the users previous offers. Can find them by player name, if they are logged in and you carry the session over, or by a browser cookie, or even IP.</code></p>
<p>Will update with progress soon.</p>

              <p>I have a lot of respect for you, AJ, but you’re in the wrong here. A lot of the people on this thread are actually nothing to do with the RSPS scene and could care less where it goes so why does that matter? RSC Shadow is one of the most talented website developers I know so if I was you I’d really take more of an interest in his opinion and take on board his criticism. You say you’re trying to progress the RSPS community but you won’t take any criticism on a big idiotic thing that you’re doing. You really should know better. If you release this with that CSS then zybez take offence all you’re doing is getting everyone who uses it into shit.</p>

<p>I’m not taking credit for some else’s hard work at the bottom of the page I added, “Template (Including HTML/CSS) created by Zybez | Slightly modified by The Web Guy.” With ‘Zybez’ being a hyperlink to the original price look up. Underneath that line in the footer it states, “PHP/MySQL done by The Web Guy.”</p>
<p>**If you don’t want to support my development, and just want to accuse me of ‘not respecting others hard work’ or ‘being lazy’ I’m asking you nicely to just stop posting on my development thread. You’re clearly just trying to start an argument for absolutely no reason, aside from the fact you just like to argue. You comment on a majority of my developments just trying to start arguments with me, honestly? Please, just grow up.</p>
