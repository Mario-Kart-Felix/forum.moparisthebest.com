    <title>Need to Find a Hyrbidscape Source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-to-find-a-hyrbidscape-source/82126</link>
    <description>I am not sure if it is supposed to be like this, but in my Hybrid Scape Folder under moparscape program folder it only has classes and no .java 

I am really interested in making a server out of Hybrid Scape just cause i havent seen any really out of it :P

so does any 1 have a download link to 1?


If the Hybrid Scape folder is actually supposed to have just .class and .cfg then please tell me how i may edit it.</description>

Yes it is suppose to be like that But there are ways around it.Try downloading CavaJ, it is a free decompiler.Search Cavaj on google for the homepage of it.I believe there is a download for another Hybridscape version outside of Moparscape but you would have to reconfigure the login packet in order to let people connect(If you don’t,you’ll have to manually make a character file).</p>
