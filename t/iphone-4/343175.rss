<p>It was exclusive in the UK to one network too at one point, but thankfully by the sounds of it, O2 are no where near as bad as AT&amp;T, and apart from some congestion issues it was alright. But now with the iPhone 4, in the UK it is on:</p>
<p>O2<br>
Orange<br>
T-Mobile<br>
3<br>
Vodaphone</p>
<p>And you can buy it sim free, no need to be locked into any UK networks when you buy the phone. As for the GSM vs CDMA thing, i’m fairly sure we only have GSM networks over here, at least for consumer/production cellular networks. But yeah, Apple’s positive reactions to having it on all the networks in the UK backs up the fact they don’t like it being exclusive to one network either.[/quote]<br>
Correct, only GSM in the UK<br>
CDMA iPhone hitting up US service provider Verizon<br>

<p>It was exclusive in the UK to one network too at one point, but thankfully by the sounds of it, O2 are no where near as bad as AT&amp;T, and apart from some congestion issues it was alright. But now with the iPhone 4, in the UK it is on:</p>
<p>O2<br>
Orange<br>
T-Mobile<br>
3<br>
Vodaphone</p>
<p>And you can buy it sim free, no need to be locked into any UK networks when you buy the phone. As for the GSM vs CDMA thing, i’m fairly sure we only have GSM networks over here, at least for consumer/production cellular networks. But yeah, Apple’s positive reactions to having it on all the networks in the UK backs up the fact they don’t like it being exclusive to one network either.</p>

<p>Well, half of the major carriers are CDMA and half are GSM.  So, I guess to be fair, the iPhone is only available on 1 of the 2 GSM carriers in the USA.  Although you would have thought if they were going to make a CDMA phone they would have done it by now, Motorola came out with the Droid (CDMA) and then the Milestone (GSM) just a month or two later.  The iPhone’s been out how many years?</p>

<p>You can change carriers just by calling them up and activating your ESN number with a new one.  If the new carrier uses different frequencies sometimes the phone needs to be flashed with new firmware, but I believe that is the same with GSM.</p>

<p>ya basically<br>
Also: this antenna issue isnt really issue, its potentially a genius idea. When i hold my phone it doesnt affect me at all, but last night i had year 13 leavers prom, on the coach back after my ex rings me up trying to control my life despite her fucking off with some other guy, if i’d have hung up she would’ve continued ringing me and just been all annoying so subeqeuntly i entertained the conversation for a bit and then just held my hand over the 2 antennas until the call failed. Design flaw or genius idea?</p>
