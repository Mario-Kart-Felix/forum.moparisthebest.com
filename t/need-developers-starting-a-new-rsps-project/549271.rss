    <description>Hello everyone so i have been coding this client and server for quite a bit now, just rewriting everything because it was so horrid and now its finally playable and i need some EXPERIENCED and well taught coders. I need a good java coder to help because if i cant figure something out and want to give up i need someone who can help me figure out the issue. I also need a good website dev because my website creation skills are like basic.

Who i need:
Website developer 
Java coder maybe 2

server info:
317 revision
pk/eco/skilling (stuff to make good money for any path you choose)

Stuff i have added:
doors 98% open and close (if u click the fuck out of them the clipping is a bit glitchy)
Pk point system (2 per kill)
fixed/changed stats for alot of items
fixed/changed prices for alot of items
added a bunch of npc&#39;s and shops etc.
implemented lumby guide to explain server and give free pkp at end of tut
click to change stats (for combat stats only)
added skilling zones
added barrows about 95% done
added anims to make firecape moving!
Added most specs some range weps might not have working specs
added just all around stability and clean no bullshit code
added working clanchat
added flawless item switching

some media:
http//prntscr.com/5uiibz
http//prntscr.com/5uiisw
(make sure to add the &#39;:&#39;)
