              <p>Where did you get the random</p>
<p>if(client.playerPremium == 1){</p>
<p>Just set 0 as norm 1 as prem 2 as mod 3 as admin 4 as donator (or owner) and 5 as owner (if donator isnt set)</p>
<p>Then set certian items to only be accessable to players 1+</p>
<p>meaning<br>
if(client.playerRights &lt; 1){</p>
<p>then if you want to be al creative you can do an if/else if/ else statement and make it so if you are player rights 0 then the items read as Premium members item</p>
