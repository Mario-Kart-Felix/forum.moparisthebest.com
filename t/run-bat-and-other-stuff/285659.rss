    <description>Someone please help me with these!

Now, i have basically a Blank source (474) i would love it if someone could tell me there code in their Playersave type thing. i want to make it so it will save my stuff on my profile. 

Then i would like to learn how to make it log out correctly. With mine when i click &quot;Log-out&quot; on my client it won&#39;t logout. But if i use a different client then everything is messed up.


Now there is another problem i have. I want to know how to make NPC&#39;s and make them talk, i used to know, it was something about opening NPC handler and adding in the code, just can&#39;t remember the code.

And i want to know how to make a Tutorial island type deal. Where you go around and learn how to do what in the game.

I also would like to know how to make the chat box chatting thing. (where you can talk to the NPC&#39;s and see the chat head)

I also would like to learn how to make a Custom Shop.

I know this is alot of stuff but i am REALLY new (to 474&#39;s). So please Help me!

(I don&#39;t care if you explain it all in this [which would be weird] or if you give me a link to a tutorial that EXPLAINS it all clearly)

Thank you and help me!

 :D (I have done 317&#39;s, i hate them so much.)</description>

              <p>Try this for your run.bat (note this is off the top of my head and it, but it should work)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">@echo off
java -Xm500m -cp .; Server
pause</code></pre>
<p>I believe that will work for your run.bat. And also, try working on a 317 for starting. They are alot easier to work with and are great for learning how to start programming your own things.</p>
