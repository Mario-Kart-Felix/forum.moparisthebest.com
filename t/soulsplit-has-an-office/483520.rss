              <p>[quote=“Ruby, post:64, topic:483520”]I’d like to add that there’s no proof of them having a contract as of yet and there probably won’t be until that contract (if there is one) ends. The second that’s let loose is the second Jagex get thousands of emails in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anger:<br>
People who have been eradicated from the scene for hosting private servers and using Jagex’s property.</li>
<li>Confusion:<br>
People wondering why Jagex have been closing down 96% of the large servers and leaving the largest, most advanced community wise, server open.</li>
<li>Requests:<br>
People wanting a similar deal for a larger cut of profit than what they’re currently taking from SoulSplit (if that is the deal).</li>
</ol>
<p>The one thing we have to remember is that if SoulSplit are paying for this office, all of those computers, all of those staff members, bills, lawyers fees, etcetera all from donations to a server which maybe holds 10000 active players (roughly a 10th of the size of RuneScape by guess), then what is Jagex really gaining from it? Those computers would roughly be £500 each, there’s around 30 of them. There’s £15,000 straight out the mark. If this is those guys full time job then they should be paying a minimum of around £300+ per week. There’s an additional £9000 per week on employee fees if there’s 30 employees to fill those computers. Add that up monthly + bills for internet, power and water you’re talking around another £1000. That comes to £37000 per month to employees and bills. They then must pay for advertisement, advertisement on several sites pertaining to RSPS and RuneScape will easily add up to a couple grand, which would probably be covered by AdSense and their own advertising revenue. They more than likely have their own servers in their office so that won’t cost anything other than bills. Even then, they must be making more than £40,000 per month to be making any kind of profit from SoulSplit. They then must pay Jagex, a 200 strong company, to allow them to keep their business.</p>
<p>I don’t see how this is possible. Jagex would be demanding sums of money I just don’t think they’d achieve from their game. Maybe they don’t have as many employees as that, but even then, take 10 grand from that. They need 30k to keep going each month without paying Jagex. Seems rather impossible to me.[/quote]Do not agree.</p>
<p>See, popular servers can make extraordinary money at surprising rates. When I had Uncalled Attack going at 150+ a day, I was making at minimum $250-$500 a day. And sometimes a ‘top donor’ would have “just got my paycheck!” and blow about $200 alone, making that amount grow even more. I could pay my bills, the server’s bills, and advertisements on the server’s donations alone. With a rather small community. So with SoulSplit with 1,000+ online all the time (they say it’s 3,000+ but we all know that number is doubled, we’ve seen the source), then I would not be surprised of the kind of money they’re making. I could only imagine the amount of people donating a day is.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I’d like to add that there’s no proof of them having a contract as of yet and there probably won’t be until that contract (if there is one) ends. The second that’s let loose is the second Jagex get thousands of emails in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anger:<br>
People who have been eradicated from the scene for hosting private servers and using Jagex’s property.</li>
<li>Confusion:<br>
People wondering why Jagex have been closing down 96% of the large servers and leaving the largest, most advanced community wise, server open.</li>
<li>Requests:<br>
People wanting a similar deal for a larger cut of profit than what they’re currently taking from SoulSplit (if that is the deal).</li>
</ol>
<p>The one thing we have to remember is that if SoulSplit are paying for this office, all of those computers, all of those staff members, bills, lawyers fees, etcetera all from donations to a server which maybe holds 10000 active players (roughly a 10th of the size of RuneScape by guess), then what is Jagex really gaining from it? Those computers would roughly be £500 each, there’s around 30 of them. There’s £15,000 straight out the mark. If this is those guys full time job then they should be paying a minimum of around £300+ per week. There’s an additional £9000 per week on employee fees if there’s 30 employees to fill those computers. Add that up monthly + bills for internet, power and water you’re talking around another £1000. That comes to £37000 per month to employees and bills. They then must pay for advertisement, advertisement on several sites pertaining to RSPS and RuneScape will easily add up to a couple grand, which would probably be covered by AdSense and their own advertising revenue. They more than likely have their own servers in their office so that won’t cost anything other than bills. Even then, they must be making more than £40,000 per month to be making any kind of profit from SoulSplit. They then must pay Jagex, a 200 strong company, to allow them to keep their business.</p>
<p>I don’t see how this is possible. Jagex would be demanding sums of money I just don’t think they’d achieve from their game. Maybe they don’t have as many employees as that, but even then, take 10 grand from that. They need 30k to keep going each month without paying Jagex. Seems rather impossible to me.</p>
