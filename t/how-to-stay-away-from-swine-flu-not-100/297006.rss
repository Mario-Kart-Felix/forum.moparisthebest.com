    <title>How to stay away from swine flu (not 100%)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-stay-away-from-swine-flu-not-100/297006</link>
    <description>Well I looked up some information today because I instantly got sick somehow, which at the moment isn&#39;t much of an affect on my body health (like muscle disabilities, etc.). So I&#39;m just trying to get everyone some help here if they have the swine flu around their area:

First thing is first, always wash your hands before you use a hand sanitizer (with more then 60% alcohal, if you get one weaker than that then your bound to get the swine flu). Use it in the morning right before you head to school, work, or any other place (it does&#39;nt matter), be careful who you are around &amp; touch - ask people if they are somewhat sick or sick at all - you never know if THEY are the ones carrying the swine flu! Keep a bottle of hand sanitizer with you in case of emergency. Stay away from large crowds, such as to be crowded around your classmates, co workers, strangers, etc.

If you happen to be sick at ALL, head the fuck over to the doctor to get checked out! Seriously and I didn&#39;t say what I just said just now to be a &quot;kid&quot; about it. Be aware of flu symptoms as well, like a fever, body ache&#39;s, sore throat, coughs, runny nose, vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy.

Wear a mask if the swine flu becomes a somewhat or very much of a hectic in  your area, this is not actually a useful method though so don&#39;t go to places thinking just because you have that on you it wont get you the flu! So take care of your body hygiene, be aware of your contact with others, and your health.

If, or as it becomes a serious moment in your area, you better stock up on vaccine! Because they have other people who are sick too, but hell your trying to stay alive yourself right? Get there FIRST! Otherwise you&#39;ll be pushed back because of the desperate people wanting THEIRS! &quot;Life&quot; gets serious, you don&#39;t want yours to be next or anywhere near that order.</description>

<p>Just live normally and if you get the virus then treat it… you wont die in it unless you seriously are in the risk group (older than 60, younger than 5 or pregnat)</p>

              <p>Well I looked up some information today because I instantly got sick somehow, which at the moment isn’t much of an affect on my body health (like muscle disabilities, etc.). So I’m just trying to get everyone some help here if they have the swine flu around their area:</p>
<p>First thing is first, always wash your hands before you use a hand sanitizer (with more then 60% alcohal, if you get one weaker than that then your bound to get the swine flu). Use it in the morning right before you head to school, work, or any other place (it does’nt matter), be careful who you are around &amp; touch - ask people if they are somewhat sick or sick at all - you never know if THEY are the ones carrying the swine flu! Keep a bottle of hand sanitizer with you in case of emergency. Stay away from large crowds, such as to be crowded around your classmates, co workers, strangers, etc.</p>
<p>If you happen to be sick at ALL, head the fuck over to the doctor to get checked out! Seriously and I didn’t say what I just said just now to be a “kid” about it. Be aware of flu symptoms as well, like a fever, body ache’s, sore throat, coughs, runny nose, vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy.</p>
<p>Wear a mask if the swine flu becomes a somewhat or very much of a hectic in  your area, this is not actually a useful method though so don’t go to places thinking just because you have that on you it wont get you the flu! So take care of your body hygiene, be aware of your contact with others, and your health.</p>
<p>If, or as it becomes a serious moment in your area, you better stock up on vaccine! Because they have other people who are sick too, but hell your trying to stay alive yourself right? Get there FIRST! Otherwise you’ll be pushed back because of the desperate people wanting THEIRS! “Life” gets serious, you don’t want yours to be next or anywhere near that order.</p>
