    <title>I would like to request for learning material for C and ASM</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-would-like-to-request-for-learning-material-for-c-and-asm/12180</link>
    <description>I would like some online tutorials and some reccommendations for books on C and ASM please.I want to create cheats for games other than runescape,which will take a long time...

[b]If ASM is unlearnable at my newby stage then please just post some references to it,thank you.[/b]



(PS. So far in java(just thought youd like to know) I can understand basic bits of code,but writing my own code will have some reference to a book as I cannot memorize the java code yet.I&#39;m working on a digital teacher,which relies heavily on the &#39;if&#39; bit of code,just finding out how to pop in into a JFrame.)

Thanks for your time.</description>

Erm… That wasn’t much of a flame war, learn C++ (not C), and please put spaces after your commas.</p>
<p>Honestly you shouldn’t even bother attempting to learn assembly right now, learn some other languages first. ASM is very difficult to learn, very difficult to remember (even for professionals), a pain in the ass, and overall not worth it unless you’re wanting to make drivers for hardware.</p>
<p>So I think either C++ or Java would be the way to go, but I still think you should practice with VB first. People have a much higher success rate when they try to learn an easier language first. Most people who try to head strait for C/C++ fail miserably.</p>

I would have to agree. Sometimes learning a programming language can be harder than learning a spoken language (but not VB or Blitz of course :D).</p>
