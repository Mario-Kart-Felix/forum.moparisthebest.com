    <description>I&#39;ve searched for an event manager, couldn&#39;t find one.

I&#39;m using insanityX, would really like the event manager so i can have a repeating server message, and other stuff.

Also if theirs a different way too add a server message without event manager? But would greatly appreciate it if someone could locate an event manager that would work for me, thanks.</description>
