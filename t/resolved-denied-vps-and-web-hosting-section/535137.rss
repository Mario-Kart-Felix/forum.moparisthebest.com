    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-denied-vps-and-web-hosting-section/535137</link>
    <description>I think it would be great to add a vps and web hosting section for members to sell cheap or offer free webhosting/vps for people who want to start rsps servers</description>

              <p>I tried to get this awhile back aswell and they said it will never happen, and if you go to rune-server its everyone claiming they purchase their crap from a Datacenter when they are clearly 15 year old kids that don’t even have the money to fork out 500+ dollars to pay for servers from a datacenter.</p>

              <p>I doubt the web hosting will ever occur due to our rules. As far as a vps section there aren’t enough questions concerning the topic to really warrant one imo.</p>

              <p>there’s hundreds of decent free webhosting services out there, both on and off shore.<br>
we don’t need to add sections for players to potentially scam, when there’s no guarantee their servers will remain up after x amount of days, or even remain active for the purchaser.</p>
<p>i could easily buy a server and run apache and sql/php daemons and sell cheap web hosting to person_a, wait for a new person to attempt to purchase, and remove all person_a’s data, and sell to person_b and so on.</p>
<p>as for vps; <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,474981.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,474981.0.html</a><br>
that topic helps enough.</p>

              <p>Well the board will DEFIANTLY not be added for the selling of cheap webhosting and/or VPS services considering purchasing and selling is against the rules as it is. And I don’t agree with adding a board at all because the general questions has been for such things for a long time now, no sense of having a board that may not have enough activity.</p>
