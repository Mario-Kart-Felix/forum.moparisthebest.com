    <title>[Hybrid PvP] - Adding Item [Help]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hybrid-pvp-adding-item-help/437062</link>
    <description>I want to add a few items such as the max cape, ring of vigor, and other various items.. But I don&#39;t know how to get their item dat files. I&#39;ve seen cache packed items across the forums: but none of them have .dat files like the HyBrid PvP client has.

I do understand how to add them to itemdef.java and item.cfg ect. Just need help on how to add the actual models to the client. I would be very thankful if someone could show me a tut, or explain how to do this.

When I wear Max cape, It removes weponary. Someone mind telling me how I could fix that.</description>
