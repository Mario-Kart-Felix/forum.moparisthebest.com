    <description>[b]Read EVERYTHING before you click on the link!!![/b][b]PLEASE COMMENT[/b]

Hello all my name is Trent, but most know me as Manzarth. I used to love playing RuneScape Classic, so I decided to say what the heck and make one myself. Now this is my own custom client, graphics, and coding. I designed everything in Microsoft paint so Im sorry about the graphics, soon I am getting adobe illustrator and photo shop so I will update the graphics as soon as possible! I tried to get it as well as I could with the origional, but then I realized alot of people like the newer runescape as well. So instead I decided to mesh the two together! It has turned out truly amazing, and I am very pleased with it if i do say so myself! :) to learn more please go to: http://www.tibiaol.webs.com Here you can see pix, videos, see some aspects of the game, and much much more!
