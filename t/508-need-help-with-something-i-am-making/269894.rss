    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-need-help-with-something-i-am-making/269894</link>
    <description>Hello Everyone, I have just recently added D Claws (Rune Claws) to my server. And made them very powerful. I am going to ask you a couple questions, that i need help with mmkay?

First i need to know how to make npcs hit higher, like the general graarador hits 40s but Kree Ara only hits 5&#39;s any idea on changing this?

Secondly, I am going to make a minigame, where you have All four GWS Bosses in a room, Chaos Elemental, KQ, KBD, and Jad all in one room. The game is.. you have to kill all of these monsters once, once you do, you get teleported to a room or island in the middle of nowhere and in the center there is a chest, Click on the chest and you get a pair of rune claws, and get teled home. I need help with the following on this..

1. Making it so once you kill all the monsters you are teleported

2. I need a suggestion on a space to put these monsters.

3. My First Problem :\

If you help me with either of these problems i will rep++ you.

~ Thank you,

<li>Find the method where a player kills a monster.</li>
<li>Create a Client object in that method, to reference the player that killed the monster’s GWMonstersKilled array.</li>
<li>Check if the monster killed is the Chaos Elemental, KQ, KBD, or Jad</li>
<li>If <span class="hashtag">#4</span> is true, do this (Assuming ‘c’ is the Client object created, and # is the element ID you want the monster killed’s ‘killed’ status to be):</li>
