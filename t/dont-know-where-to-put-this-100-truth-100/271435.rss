    <description>Yesterday was a tragic day for many of us, Our friend Gs Pk Pure was sadly hit by a car and killed. Although he was banned from the forum many time&#39;s he always wanted to stay with us, He was the creator of some great source&#39;s such as

[ul][li]National Pkz[/li]
[li]Project 2k9[/li]
[li]and he also helped code 508pkz508[/li][/ul]


I am sad to see him gone. and i&#39;m sure many of us are. His memory will always lie with us...

[size=18pt]Rest in peace, Our friend...Gs Pk Pure[/size]
