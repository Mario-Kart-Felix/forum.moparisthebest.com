    <description>This is one i came up with after seeing the Westboro Baptist Church protests. For those of you who do not know what i am talking about.

Obviously the one guy in the picture is on my side.

I was thinking if these members were out protesting and managed to get run over by someone. i would gladly stand out there and hold up a sign 
&quot;Thank god for drunk drivers&quot;
I just think it is the sweet subtle revenge our troops deserve.
I have 5 members of my family deployed in iraq at present and seeing these guys hurting would do me great pleasure.

I do not condone drunk driving.</description>

<p>Respect goes along way though, and i think they are doing it for the wrong reason. (I know i said the shunned word in an argument, think)<br>
If they have such a problem with the troops they should join and voice it as an inside issue. Would be a much better way to get things accomplished. The reason they are against our troops is because of homosexuals.<br>
“Anyone who has a c-section is dooming humanity” unnatural child birth. Even if it saves their own life, its still not your choice to make.<br>
The ones over giving their lives so they can have the right to free speech. And they are standing around bashing them. Tell me where the reason is in this?<br>
I would like to see them over in the only hell that exists. If they call war justifiable manslaughter, then i am sure there is justification behind condemming those who do it for us. I would like to send them on a road trip to iraq to see what happens, where the stumble upon a IED. With no arms or legs, i would like to see them hold their signs.<br>
New sign: “If Fags exist, its their fault --&gt;”</p>
