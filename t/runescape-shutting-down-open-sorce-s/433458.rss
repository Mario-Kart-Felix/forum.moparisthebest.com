<p>[quote=“XxraidersxX, post:5, topic:433458”]so there going to allow rsps?[/quote]</p><blockquote>Like Firefox’s Mozilla foundation: this small non-profit firm (Gielinor Foundation, to be abbreviated GF for short [no pun intended] for the remaining parts of this thread) will maintain Runescape’s Opensource code and coordinate all updates to it from the wide community of volunteer developers. <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Of course, the sourcecode will be under the GPL licensing agreement, anybody can use the code to produce their own version of Runescape and host it on their own hardware.</span></span> But those that will choose to do so, are mandated to give back their changes to GF for inclusion to the main Runescape code tree.

Though, this will open-up the possibility for someone to just get his/her own Runescape version running and self-hosted legally.</p>

<p>^^FALSE,because all games requiring working to achieve something. Personally runescape should not even think about shutting down they worked to hard in what they did. And still have a big population of still active players. I will agree the community it’s horrible. And it’s not what the players want anymore it’s about what jagex wants now but when it all comes down to it you can kind of relate it to the real world. For example, noobs asking for money would be like a hobo standing somewhere with a sign doing it, scammers would be like drug dealers. I don’t see how its hard for new players it shows you what to do and there’s an arrow that points to where you should go on the minimap. A game is always going to be challenging.<br>

Say why you want it shut down.  Because it’s “Gay” isn’t a valid reason.</p>
