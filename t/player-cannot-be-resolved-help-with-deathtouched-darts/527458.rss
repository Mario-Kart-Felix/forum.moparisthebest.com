    <description>trying to add deathtouched darts, did exactly as the post says,
spawned them in game and they weren&#39;t one hitting, went through eclipse and its saying theres an error in the coding

&quot;player cannot be resolved&quot;
&quot;player cannot be resolved to a variable&quot;


here&#39;s the code if it matters. Idk I&#39;m just a noob and I&#39;ve never coded. just want to try these things out &gt;.&gt;




if (weaponName.contains(&quot;deathtouched dart&quot;)) {
                                            if (target instanceof Player) {
                                                Player p2 = (Player) target;
                                                p2.stopAll();
                                            } else {
                                                    NPC n = (NPC) target;
                                                                Player player;
																World.sendProjectile(player, n, 3429, 41, 36, 50, 0, 15, 0);
                                                                n.setNextGraphics(new Graphics(3428));
                                                    n.setCapDamage(200000);
                                                    n.applyHit(new Hit(player, n.getHitpoints(), HitLook.CRITICAL_DAMAGE));
                                                    player.getAppearence().generateAppearenceData();
                                                    }
                                                }</description>
