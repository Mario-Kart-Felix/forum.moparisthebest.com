    <title>508 HD Client Map Loading Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-hd-client-map-loading-problem/293721</link>
    <description>I used to use Moparscape a lot a year or too ago, but since then, 508 HD clients servers came out so I chose to give it a try.. I have a server and client, both running, but I hit a roadblock.. I don&#39;t know if this issue has been addressed before (if it has, please show me the post or tutorial), but when I attempt to, for example, teleport to a certain location on tutorial island, the game crashes with a runtime error/array-overload error.
To make sure the map was loadable, I ran from Edgeville to Draynor with no crashes whatsoever, but the second I attempted to go below a certain y-coordinate (approximately 3100 or thereabouts), the game crashed. I believe it is the client or the cache, but I am not 100% sure.

I am not looking for an easy way out of this - if the problem is being worked on by a development team, I&#39;d love to help.

Thanks,

-Going too far west on karamja (towards Brimhaven from the F2P Docks)
-Below a certain point on tutorial island (I can teleport to the northern tip of the island (around the bank), but no lower)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 08, 2009, 09:04:08 am[/size][hr]Here&#39;s the error message I get when I use Josh&#39;s HD 508 Client IP Changer and Mithscape V.1:
