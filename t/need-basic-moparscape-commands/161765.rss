    <description>alright so i just recently downloaded moparscape and i got how to spawn npc&#39;s and pickup items and stuff but some things i can&#39;t figure out is how to give the npc&#39;s drops and how to give them hp because when i attack them i just hit a zero and they die... also idk but i think it&#39;s just my computer but i want to download some of the mod clients that other players have made but for some reason i can save the file but when i try to open them it just comes to a blank page that says it can&#39;t open it and goes back to asking me to save or open the file....

please and thanks =P
