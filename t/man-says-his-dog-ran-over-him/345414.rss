    <title>Man says his DOG ran over him</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/man-says-his-dog-ran-over-him/345414</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;A man in Webster accused his bulldog of running over him with his own car Monday night.

According to the report from the Hernando County Sheriff&#39;s Office, Christopher Bishop was checking his motor oil on Monday night when he said Tassey, his &quot;vehicle energetic bulldog,&quot; jumped into the front seat while the car was in neutral.

Bishop believes that Tassey knocked the car into gear while Bishop was underneath it checking for leaks, which caused the car to run over him.

&quot;When I was tightening it down, my dog jumped up into the truck and hit the gear shift and knocked it in reverse,&quot; Bishop said.

He then found himself under his own truck with Tassey at the wheel.

&quot;The front left tire caught both of my back legs and it twisted me and of course the truck kept on going,&quot; Bishop said.

Bishop was able to get up and stop the car before it could run into a fence next to his mobile home.

He ended up with only a few abrasions on the left side of his body. However, instead of seeking help for his pain right away, Bishop waited a few hours inside of his home to see if the pain would go away.

When the pain didn&#39;t let up, Bishop enlisted the help of his neighbor, Steve Hargrove, who called for help. 

Bishop was eventually treated by Pasco Regional Hospital with minimal injuries and released.

Bishop said he plans to keep working on his truck, but will keep an eye on Tassey while doing so.

&quot;I learned a lesson,&quot; Bishop said. &quot;You don&#39;t never crawl under a truck whether it&#39;s in park, neutral, or anything else and it&#39;s running.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If I read this right his car was running when he was under it?  Because that is just plain stupid so he deserved whatever he got.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t running, he is still an idiot because he has never heard of a parking break?  Or tire chocks?  Idiot.<br>

              <blockquote>A man in Webster accused his bulldog of running over him with his own car Monday night.
<p>According to the report from the Hernando County Sheriff’s Office, Christopher Bishop was checking his motor oil on Monday night when he said Tassey, his “vehicle energetic bulldog,” jumped into the front seat while the car was in neutral.</p>
<p>Bishop believes that Tassey knocked the car into gear while Bishop was underneath it checking for leaks, which caused the car to run over him.</p>
<p>“When I was tightening it down, my dog jumped up into the truck and hit the gear shift and knocked it in reverse,” Bishop said.</p>
<p>He then found himself under his own truck with Tassey at the wheel.</p>
<p>“The front left tire caught both of my back legs and it twisted me and of course the truck kept on going,” Bishop said.</p>
<p>Bishop was able to get up and stop the car before it could run into a fence next to his mobile home.</p>
<p>He ended up with only a few abrasions on the left side of his body. However, instead of seeking help for his pain right away, Bishop waited a few hours inside of his home to see if the pain would go away.</p>
<p>When the pain didn’t let up, Bishop enlisted the help of his neighbor, Steve Hargrove, who called for help.</p>
<p>Bishop was eventually treated by Pasco Regional Hospital with minimal injuries and released.</p>
<p>Bishop said he plans to keep working on his truck, but will keep an eye on Tassey while doing so.</p>
<p>“I learned a lesson,” Bishop said. “You don’t never crawl under a truck whether it’s in park, neutral, or anything else and it’s running.”</p>
