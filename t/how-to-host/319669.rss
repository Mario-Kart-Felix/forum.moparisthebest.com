    <title>How to host?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-host/319669</link>
    <description>Hello, I was just wondering on how to host a server on the  Server Status Page.
I have to Port Forward my port through uTorrent. There is a guid on moparisthebest.com on how to do it. So i run that. I have my runserver up. I can connect locally to my server but when i try to host it it says it is offline and will not let me continue.  Yes i have a no-ip but i do not think they are linked together.
I really need some step by step instructions on what to do. Is there some line of code in my server i have to change to my no-ip.org adress? or what? 

Thanks guys! =)</description>

              <p>Please don’t double post. Ask one of your friends to try to log on to your server, and if they can, your server is online, but the MSSP will say it is offline. Don’t worry about the MSSP.<br>
If your friend cannot log on, check you No-IP DUC, and make sure the box next to the IP name is checked, and the smiley face is blushing. If they still cannot connect, check your settings on uTorrent.</p>
