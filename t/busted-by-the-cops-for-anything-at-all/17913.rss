              <p>how about this shit. i was just charged with simple possession of marijuana (0.6 grams) and possession of drug paraphernalia( my black bowl) at school.</p>
<p>my story starts on a friday before school, my parents had just left at 5:30 to go to the nascar race and i was home alone. i got a shower and packed me up a nice bowl. smoked it and was feeling pretty straight. ate some poptarts and smoked me another bowl. at 6:15 i packed my bowl lighter weed and what not up to go to school,along with 2 poptarts. i got to my busstop which is surround by houses since i live in a neighboorhood and i could barely stand in place. i was falling over and shit. the bus finally came and i got on with joy. this was by far the most exciting bus ride ever. after getting to my seat at the back of the bus i pulled out my psp and  took out the headphones and played the song midnight train by journey. by this time i was super stoned and was laughing out loud on my bus. this continued for almost an hour until we arrived at school. while sitting on the bus waiting for the bell i packed me up another one, yes right there on the bus. the bell rung and i raced to find my friend kyle. i told him what i had and he was like c’mon get in my car and lets go. so i got in his car in which we smoked another bowl. well i went the whole day fine and then at the end of the day on the bus ride home i took a couple resin hits on the bus. the following monday i returned to school with my bowl and my friend hooked me up with some bud. in 2nd block the ass.principal came in and took me to his office.there i was searched and was charged with simple possession of marijuana  and possession of drug paraphernalia. my mom was uber pissed and what not and now im grounded on probation have to take mandatory drug tests go to court and all this shit but yeh i took a drug test and fucking passed <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> it was amazing i dont know how i did it but if someone has an explanation on how after 2 days of getting completely baked i passed a drug test let me know</p>

              <p>I’m cool so I’m gonna say I got in to a fight of super ninjas who all had guns. I got out my knife and I was like “knife, l0l?”. They said “Ok”. We were dancing around a bit taking desperate stabs at eachother. I then pulled out my knife and went “lol” and shot. I then said to their corpses “lol, owned pl0x?”.</p>
<p>Some old lady was watching and called the cops. I made a run for it before they came. I really needed a piss so I went down an alley to have one. Anyway, the cops pulled up and I was like “oh shitz0rs.” I did my zip up and got done in for Public Urination.</p>
