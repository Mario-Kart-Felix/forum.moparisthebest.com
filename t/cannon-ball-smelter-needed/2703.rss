    <description>Cannon Ball Smelter Needed -


Could anyone please be kind enough to make a cannon ball smelter for SCAR if there is already one made could you please point me towards it as i have had no luck searching the boards for it. 

Im aware that supersmelt for aryan does it but i do not wish to use aryan on my main :)


Thanks to all that reply sensibly.</description>
