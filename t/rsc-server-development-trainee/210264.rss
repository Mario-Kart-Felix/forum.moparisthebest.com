    <description>Hey Mopar,

I&#39;m Dylan. I&#39;m from B.C., Canada. My past history of Runescape dates back to around 2005 (give or take a year.) [in other words, the birth of runescape classic.] But this topic isn&#39;t about you guys getting to know me. 

I have this urge to learn how to code, manage, and run a server. I have the drive to take however long it usually takes to learn it, or even longer. With summer coming up, I really REALLY want something to do over the summer that is educational. Yes, I want to learn this for EDUCATIONAL use. I&#39;m 15, and all of my teachers say that I&#39;m a pretty smart kid, and that when I put my head to something, I can do it. If I learn to do what I want to do, I&#39;d say I can become a [b]pretty nice asset to this community.[/b]
I can see that this forum (this section, in paticular) is quite against newcomers learning (or, in other words, ctrl+ving) how to make a server. I&#39;ve read almost every post in the forum, and what I&#39;ve learned so far is this: packets are literally bags of information that are sent from the client to the server, such as when someone drops an item, attacks a monster, turns on a prayer, etc...environmental tables are paths that your computer recognizes, as in if you add your whole location of your &quot;compile.bat&quot; to the path list, then it will recognize it as &quot;...wholepath/compile.bat&quot;.

I&#39;m guessing I&#39;ve learned around 0.5% of what I have to. Somethings that I&#39;ve read about that I still don&#39;t understand are MySQL databases, Hamachi (sounds like a pokemon), and Apache ANT. Also learning to code Java might be helpful.

So, if you&#39;re willing to take me under your wing, private message me and we can swap MSN&#39;s or something. I&#39;m sure you guys know what you&#39;re doing better than I do.

Thanks so much,
Dylan</description>

<p>Anyway, to be completely honest with you, most people simply don’t have the time to give a person sufficient one-on-one help.<br>
People don’t mind for small things (eg, frank_ has given me loads of help with various things over time), but it’s not going to happen when you’re just a beginner. The reason for this isn’t because you’re seen as useless but simply because there are already plenty of resources on the web aimed at beginners.<br>
You’re better off picking up what you can from these other resources and making a bit of a name for yourself. If you manage that then I see no reason why people wouldn’t be happy to answer your questions on more RSC-specific programming related subjects (ie, client protocol and so on).</p>
<p>As for resources, <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/</a> is a personal favourite.</p>

its 430mb uncompressed, and like ~100mb compressed. its very easy to install imo.</p>

id recommend searching on google for how to set divinepk up, and go from there. but after you set it up, you should learn java before you try to code.<br>
