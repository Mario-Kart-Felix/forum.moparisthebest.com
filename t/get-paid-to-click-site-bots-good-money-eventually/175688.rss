    <description>This is a way to get cash while doing whatever.

The cash isn&#39;t THAT good in the beginning, but you can easily earn enough to pay for your wow, knight online or any other game you play each month. And you don&#39;t have to do any work at all.

Requirements:
Internet connection
And a paypal account (Paypal)

If you sign up please put hellboiy as a referrer.

Paid to click sites work by you clicking a link to open an add and look at it for 30 seconds. Then you receive a small amount (you can make quite a lot of money over a long run. Read below if you want details). But we all know its boring to look at those adds. Autoclickers will click the links for you. You don&#39;t even have to open a browser window.

The paid to click site is:

Use these links if you wanna support me:

http://bux.t0/?r=hellboiy      (or regualar link http://bux.t0)                                                                               *replace the 0 in the link with an o . for some reason when i post it normally it changes to google.com :S

After logging in you can click incentives -&gt; browse adds if you wanna look at em manually. But that&#39;s no fun.

Autoclicker links:

http://www.autoclickers.uni.cc/en/downloads
No Pass

When you unzip the program you will get a folder that looks like this:

Simply run the marked program and a window like this will pop up:


You type in your user name/password for the paid to click site (You should always use another pass/user name than you normally use elsewhere). Personally i use &quot;check between 1 and 3 minutes&quot;. This is how often the program will check for new adds. Now you simply press start and wait. The program will automatically browse the adds and make you money.
You can also minimize the programs without problems (they will go to your task bar in the lowest right corner). They will still click while being minimized.

If you wanna make some real money with this (in the beginning you wont make THAT much. But it doesn&#39;t require any work, so its free and easy money. Then you should use the money you earn to upgrade to a premium account at the sites or buy ref&#39;s. This will greatly improve your profit..


If you got any questions or anything you want elaborated then let feel free to ask.

It is clean it shows up in some because it acts like a virus would. I and many other people use them. If you don&#39;t feel safe with the programs you can click the ads manually and still make money.</description>
