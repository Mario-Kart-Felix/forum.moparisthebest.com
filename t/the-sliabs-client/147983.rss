    <description>Hello Everyone, unfortunately I&#39;m currently having trouble with The Silab&#39;s Client. After I downloaded it and extracted &quot;version 3&quot;, &quot;Client&quot; and &quot;Run&quot; popped up on my desktop. I double clicked &quot;Client&quot; and nothing came up. I double clicked &quot;Run&quot; and this came up telling me that I have a problem.

After seeing this image, you are probably thinking that I have not downloaded Jdk, Well, I have downloaded Jdk, but do I need this many?

I hope you can figure out the problem I am facing.
