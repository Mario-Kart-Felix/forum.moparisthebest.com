    <title>A Chance to Shine!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-chance-to-shine/452453</link>
    <description>Note: I wasn&#39;t sure where to post this as I am not looking to join or acquire a Development Team... Rather I am only in need of a single developer to fix small issues on a fully functional (and running) source.

Hello!  My name is Alex and I am an Administrator for a RSPS that gets around 600 players (Forum Traffic) passing through each day.  With your guys&#39; help, I would like to triple that number!

Let me begin by describing what exactly I am offering.  Obviously, if you&#39;re willing to code for the Server I represent out of goodwill/boredom/what have you, then great!  If not, you will need to prove your expertise before I would be willing to offer a monthly stipend.  

Next, I would like to give you a brief background on what exactly you would be getting yourself in to (so we&#39;re 100% clear ;)).  I&#39;ll try to refrain from mentioning the RSPS&#39;s name in case this is somehow viewed as solicitation or advertising.  Basically, the Server I Staff has been around for 4 years and like most servers, it has experienced its ups and downs.  Currently, we are swiftly recovering from having maybe 20 players online (max) at any given time to 85ish on a good day.  There was a period of a year where, in our second version of the server, we had 150+ on at [i]all[/i] times of the day!  With your help, I am sure we can get back there.

I am the Head of Staff for the Server and it would basically be run by you and I.  The Owner is somewhat inactive and therefore has charged me with doing most of his handywork.  Unfortunately, I am as good at Programming as I am at Juggling (and I&#39;m a bloody awful Juggler).  This is why I am looking to contract a coder.

We have a stable source but there a lot of improvements that could be made.  (For clarification, WE DO HAVE A WORKING SOURCE, but like most sources, there a quite a bit of flaws that should be fixed so the whole system operates smoother.)  Hopefully, you&#39;ll be interested by this proposition and Private Message me back so we can work out the details.  Together, we can do great things. :)

Respectfully inquisitive,

-Alex</description>

He’s a fairly widely respected web developer who’s released multiple professional looking website templates.  Plus the fact that you call people faggots doesn’t exactly help your standpoint.</p>

<p>If I were you I’d calm down. You’re not being very professional right now, that won’t look good on this thread. Ruby has contributed to this community more than you have, and that’s all you need to know about him.</p>

I have the right to judge whoever the hell I please, however having the ground to accuse you of being a retard and being able to support it is something else entirely.  We can judge and accuse you of being an idiot if you’re saying it took you 2 years to grasp MySQL work, unless you can tell us something that’s actually advanced that you can do.</p>

              <p>Note: I wasn’t sure where to post this as I am not looking to join or acquire a Development Team… Rather I am only in need of a single developer to fix small issues on a fully functional (and running) source.</p>
<p>Hello!  My name is Alex and I am an Administrator for a RSPS that gets around 600 players (Forum Traffic) passing through each day.  With your guys’ help, I would like to triple that number!</p>
<p>Let me begin by describing what exactly I am offering.  Obviously, if you’re willing to code for the Server I represent out of goodwill/boredom/what have you, then great!  If not, you will need to prove your expertise before I would be willing to offer a monthly stipend.</p>
<p>Next, I would like to give you a brief background on what exactly you would be getting yourself in to (so we’re 100% clear ;)).  I’ll try to refrain from mentioning the RSPS’s name in case this is somehow viewed as solicitation or advertising.  Basically, the Server I Staff has been around for 4 years and like most servers, it has experienced its ups and downs.  Currently, we are swiftly recovering from having maybe 20 players online (max) at any given time to 85ish on a good day.  There was a period of a year where, in our second version of the server, we had 150+ on at <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> times of the day!  With your help, I am sure we can get back there.</p>
<p>I am the Head of Staff for the Server and it would basically be run by you and I.  The Owner is somewhat inactive and therefore has charged me with doing most of his handywork.  Unfortunately, I am as good at Programming as I am at Juggling (and I’m a bloody awful Juggler).  This is why I am looking to contract a coder.</p>
<p>We have a stable source but there a lot of improvements that could be made.  (For clarification, WE DO HAVE A WORKING SOURCE, but like most sources, there a quite a bit of flaws that should be fixed so the whole system operates smoother.)  Hopefully, you’ll be interested by this proposition and Private Message me back so we can work out the details.  Together, we can do great things. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Respectfully inquisitive,</p>
<p>-Alex</p>
