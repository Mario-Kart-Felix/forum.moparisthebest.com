    <title>How would I put player rights on this command?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-put-player-rights-on-this-command/120975</link>
    <description>hi guys, I no this is abit stupid, but how would I give this command rights of 2:

[code]else if (command.startsWith(&quot;getbonus&quot;)); 
{
GetBonus();
sendMessage(&quot;Successful! - gb&quot;);
}[/code]

it may sound easy, but I tried many different ways, but it didnt work..

Many Thanks

<p>You don’t need a ; after the first command line.</p>
