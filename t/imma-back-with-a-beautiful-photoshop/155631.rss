    <description>Hey everybody, you probably don&#39;t remember me, I was a lesser known member.
But after a couple of MONTHS i&#39;m back, and thanks to Facepunch Studios ([url=http://Forums.facepunchstudios.com]Forums.facepunchstudios.com[/url]) And Garry&#39;s Mod ([url=http://www.garrysmod.com]www.garrysmod.com[/url]) I present you with: Nuke.

Sorry, but I couldn&#39;t find the original picture, it was just the guy on a bluescreen.</description>

<p>Okay, well first off its very boring and smudged, anyone can smudge/blur a render/stock. It takes a good graphics artist to do it well. You didn’t do it well. It doesn’t look like a Nuke has gone off at all because there are no particles in the air whizzing past and the man looks unharmed. You would think the title nuke would present something violent and destructive but frankly this piece is nowhere near that.</p>
<p>It’s not a beautiful photoshop and I don’t think its the best thing you’ve done. Not much time spent on it and if it did take you a while, it was a waste of time because the outcome is mediocre.</p>
<p>Sorry about being harsh I just don’t like people who exaggerate things; it gets my hopes up only to see crap.[/quote][quote=“exe626, post:6, topic:155631”]They showed you how to put too much light on pictures and make it look bad?[/quote]<br>
Basically it was a redo of the original poster’s picture and the title nuke was just what he chose, honestly it was an interesting photoshop to make and I thought turned out quite well.<br>

<p>I also forgot to mention it really isn’t a “nuke” so much more like a large blast of the sort.</p>
