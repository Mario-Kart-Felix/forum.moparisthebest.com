    <title>Help with super sets</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-super-sets/425326</link>
    <description>Is it possible to make it when a player logs out or in or anything, there stats stay the same for super set except if they die.
So pretty much if i drink super str my stats would stay at 117 (assuming im 99 str) and it would never go down unless I die in the wilderness. Also if restarting server would effect that at all. Using Demise pking btw
Thanks you :]</description>
