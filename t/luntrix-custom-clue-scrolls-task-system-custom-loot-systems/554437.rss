[center][size=18pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/center]

[center][size=14pt]Hello everyone.
Luntrix is a relatively new server, that has been out for just over 2 weeks. We felt like before releasing our server we should fix up the majority of bugs that were present ingame. We feel that now, we are at the point that we are ready to start advertising our server and further develop our server.

Luntrix hosts a wide variety of activities for you to take part in. We have active staff members, dedicated owners and an active player base. We recently hit close to 40 players online at one time 
which was a big accomplishment for us but we want to expand our community and we hope that you decide to stop in and check out Luntrix.[/size][/center]
