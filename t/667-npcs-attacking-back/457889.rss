    <title>667 Npc&#39;s attacking back?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-npcs-attacking-back/457889</link>
    <description>So when I have a spawned npc most of the time they will not attack me back. Like QBD In The source.. I just added Party Demon and he wont attack back unless I spawn him. Help please..? I believe I must make him move, But how do I change that?</description>
