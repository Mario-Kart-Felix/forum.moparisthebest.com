    <title>Why does this happen to me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-does-this-happen-to-me/333478</link>
    <description>Hi, so i just started a server and my port forwarding works and everything is set to run. So i started the server and checked if it was online using google server checker and it says its online. The problem i have is that when i try and connect using a client this is what it says in the server CMD:

Connection from 192.168.**.***       &lt;&lt;&lt; I have hidden my ip address.     
Connection reset
java.net.SocketException: Connection reset
     at java.net.SocketInputStream.read&lt;uknown Source&gt;
     at client.fillinStream&lt;client.java:9855
     at client.run&lt;client.java:18634&gt;
     at java.lang.Thread.run&lt;uknown Source&gt;
ClientHandler: Client null disconnected &lt;192.168.**.***&gt;

It does this three times then on the client it says &quot;error connecting to server&quot;
If you know how to fix please let me know! Thanks</description>

and it tries to tell you that there is an error in client.java at line 9855, and an other (or not an error, but got caused by the first) is on line 18634</p>
