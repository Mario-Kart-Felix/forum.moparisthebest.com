    <title>Storing Variables While Running the Application</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/storing-variables-while-running-the-application/552941</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m making a basic program to keep track of my budget and my money. I would like to be able input, for example, how much I spent on groceries this week through the program and have it stored without being lost once the program is closed. Would i need to create a database or something that java can pull information from and edit or can I get away with having java edit it&#39;s own code in the class files.

Again, just to clarify, I&#39;m wanting to be able to run my program, go through the prompts and be able to enter values and have the program save them.

Thank you</description>

              <p>More tips but instead for the visualization part :</p>
<p>If you’re extremely new, try use the console and make the program.</p>
<p>Then look at using swing with WindowBuilder for eclipse IDE. It’s a great tool that allows you to see what you’re making. Then if you feel comfortable take on a JavaFX build <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>For something simple, you could use java.util.Properties since it can be stored to plaintext. Otherwise, maybe use JSON and find a third party API that supports serialization and deserialization to/from JSON.</p>

              <p>well for something like this you could use:</p>

<p>A standard printwriter could also work (I would stick with a comma delimiter format)</p>
<p>Personally I would stick with either the printwriter or a database because you could easily import the file into sql or another  financial application if you so desire.</p>
