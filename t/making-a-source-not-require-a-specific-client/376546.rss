    <title>Making a source (not) require a specific client</title>

    <description>Hello Moparscape :)

I know for a fact that I&#39;ve seen tutorials for this (like 2 years ago though), that explained how to make a server require a specific client. What I want to do (I&#39;m using a battlescape 317- based source) is allow a separate client to connect to it (still a 317 client). None of my other 317 clients connect to this. I understand that there&#39;s ganna be some compatibility issues because the client won&#39;t have the same models, sprites, and stuff like that, but how would I start out by allowing a separate client to connect?</description>
