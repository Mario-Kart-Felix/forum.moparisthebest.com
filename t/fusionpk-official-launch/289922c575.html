<p>the trolling began on march 28 2009 after you banned me from rscpk. you also have yourself to blame for it, for feeding the flames. i added you on facebook, yes, and i do know very well what kind of response i will received <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>You honestly remember the date? That’s VERY pathetic dude. VERY pathetic.<br>
You’re acting as if I should care if you follow me around like a lost dog. I don’t care lmfao. You can cry all you want to, I honestly don’t care. Apart from still being stuck on getting banned from RSCPK (for something that YOU caused), it’s just very pathetic.</p>

<p>a few problems here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>apparently, being good at remembering dates makes me “pathetic”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you say that you “don’t care” but you’re always quick to start an argument over something… pretend to not care all you want jessekins, i already know that you’re always emotionally debilitated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no i am not “stuck on being banned from rscpk”, i’m just reminding you of what started all of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yes thanks for reminding me of my social rejection (on the internet, boo-hoo)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yes i know what you meant about “text having meaning on the internet”, but since you’re bringing that up about me, i suppose i should do the same to you (oh wait, you’ll say something asinine, such as, “we’re not talking about me, we’re talking about YOU”) also, of course text has meaning… the internet is made up of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you know that “i wouldn’t get it anyways”, what was the purpose of hoping that it wouldn’t be too hard for me to comprehend? logic jessekins, plz try to obtain some.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and last but not least, LOL at you jessekins</p>

<p>I hope that wasn’t too confusing for you. Even if it wasn’t you still wouldn’t get it anyways.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>a few problems here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>apparently, being good at remembering dates makes me “pathetic”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you say that you “don’t care” but you’re always quick to start an argument over something… pretend to not care all you want jessekins, i already know that you’re always emotionally debilitated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no i am not “stuck on being banned from rscpk”, i’m just reminding you of what started all of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yes thanks for reminding me of my social rejection (on the internet, boo-hoo)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yes i know what you meant about “text having meaning on the internet”, but since you’re bringing that up about me, i suppose i should do the same to you (oh wait, you’ll say something asinine, such as, “we’re not talking about me, we’re talking about YOU”) also, of course text has meaning… the internet is made up of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you know that “i wouldn’t get it anyways”, what was the purpose of hoping that it wouldn’t be too hard for me to comprehend? logic jessekins, plz try to obtain some.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and last but not least, LOL at you jessekins[/quote]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, it does make you pathetic. I asked a few people if they remember you, or you being banned. They said no. Getting banned from RSCPK obviously traumatized you. It’s one thing to still be upset over something that happened 6 months ago, but it’s another thing to obsess over it, and obsess over the guy who banned you. I honestly believe you should be in therapy if you care so much about being banned over a game, a game that’s not even around anymore.</p>
<p>Having being amused by arguments means I care? That honestly makes no sense. It’s hypocritical of you to say that anyways. You’re the one always starting with me correct? Now each and every time you say you don’t care. Yeah I think otherwise.<br>
How you read my text has no bearing on how my real emotional feeling are. If you think that it does then you honestly care too much to think so.</p>
<p>If you have that good of a memory, then you should remember that it was also your fault for being banned. I believe you attacked an administrator while he was trying to talk to you. You being a repeated problem maker before on RSCPK, stirring up my members for no reason, it was a ticking time bomb for you to be banned. Sure, I could have toughed it out and let you stay. The question is - Why? You were no use to me or RSCPK. You complained every chance you got. No matter how much my server “sucked”, you always came back. One person can only take but so much, and you crossed that line.<br>
I believe that, since I’m not the type of guy to cater to every one of your needs and wont listen to reason once I made up my mind, you can’t stand that. Since every other server that you have been on listened to what you had to say (I’m just guessing here, don’t take it too seriously), that you held a grudge against me. I’m also thinking, because of that reason it has done something to you. I’m not sure what, but it’s obviously made you completely obsessed over me. Flattering as it is, that I can have such an affect over someone, you need to get over it.</p>
<p>I like how you said “over the internet”. You and I both know I cannot prove that you have no friends off the internet (as obvious that it is, you don’t have friends, I still can’t prove it). It’s the oldest trick in the book. It’s old.</p>
<p>That honestly made no sense. “The text has meaning, the internet is made up of it”. That most certainly does not mean the text has meaning. It just means the internet uses text. It is YOU to de-cipher whether the text means something to you or not.</p>
<p>To see you struggle, like you do with all of your other arguments. Though you STILL didn’t get what I was saying, obviously, but I’ll let that go. Mainly because it was only for my enjoyment. I can see another little technique you do. You over exaggerate. “logic, please try to obtain some”.<br>
We both know I knew what I was talking about, you just tried to make it out like you knew too. I forgot how fun it was to argue with you.</p>
<p>If there was something to laugh at, Pork, I would be laughing to. Sadly, it’s all you.</p>
<p>Oo damn, just realized how much I wrote.</p>

        <p>I think you’ll find that towards the end, FusionPK’s active population was growing exponentially. I at the moment literally have no time what so ever for this type of project, which left Mew on his own, he was also busy, but tried his up most to keep the server running. But it’s not easy and it’s certainly not cheap. I feel bad for leaving him in the lurch like I did but what can you do? I’ve gotta get on irl. Lock this topic. It was great while it lasted. Mew pointed our domain to RSCA in a bid to send our players there, pretty much the only server that have a clue what they’re doing.</p>
