    <title>Prayer Hover Interfaces - (requested to ask here)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/prayer-hover-interfaces-requested-to-ask-here/345629</link>
    <description>Well, hello everyone. I am new to the MoparScape world, and I&#39;ve a few days of Java under my belt.
There&#39;s a lot of things dealing with Java that I just can&#39;t seem to figure out.

Well, back on topic.

I am using the Natural Born Killers base, which to me, is a pretty nice base. The files are neat, the code lines are neat. And, all in all, it&#39;s a good base, to me. But, if you think otherwise, let me know.

Okay, well - strayed off topic again, sorry.. 

Now-

[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc1qzQnjCIQ]The video is here.[/url]

Those hover-over interfaces, I want to add them into my server, and whenever you hover over the prayer it will show what it shows above. Once I find out how to do that, I, on my own, do the same thing for the new prayers. (Turmoil, Wrath, Soul Split, etc.)

Well, I know you have to have the interface itself for each prayer, which I am currently PhotoShopping.

As of now, whenever you hover over the prayer, in the top left corner of the game-screen it says..
 &quot;Activate Incredible Reflexes, 5620&quot; (for every prayer, this is a mere example.)
Well, I want to get rid of the comma and the number, how would I go about doing that?

Well, I would appreciate it if you would only give me hints on what to do, because I wish to learn how to do FULLY do this on my own later on in the future.

Thank you.</description>
