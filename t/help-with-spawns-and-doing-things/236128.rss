    <title>Help with spawns and doing things</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-spawns-and-doing-things/236128</link>
    <description>I am new at using mopar and i would like to know somethings
1. Is there a way that i can get all the spawns? Like, as close as 100% of all the spawns as possible.
2. When i spawn an npc, i cant pickpocket it, i cant trade it, when i atack it dies in 1 hit.
How do i fix these problems.

Thanks in return</description>

              <p>Answer to 1: Yeah, if you really had the time and put in the effort<br>
Answer to 2: Pickpocket - (wont give you a tutorial but here’s a rough idea)<br>
|<br>
|<br>
First click, make it a void - and create a void, so when you click the NPC, it gives you money, etc.</p>
<p>For trading, first click NPC, make it: 'wanneshop = ’ and then in shops.cfg add the correct shop ID.<br>
When you attack the NPC, it dies in 1 hit…</p>
<p>Change the 4. (i.e 3  4  3)<br>
The 4 is its health, if you don’t see it, then add one.</p>
