<p>Who cares, make them walk. The servers that use commands are terrible, one problem with most servers is that barely any of them are realistic, which is why I never play them.[/quote]I don’t mean to sound like a douche, but “realistic” is a bad term to use, when your referring to RuneScape and Private servers, considering the whole thing is fantasy.</p>

<p>What’s the point of that? It’s so unrealistic, why doesn’t he just make the player talk with an npc through dialogue to see if he wants to purchase one?</p>
