    <title>Looking for the best $1000 computer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-the-best-1000-computer/547873</link>
    <description>Does anyone have recommendations? I plan on buying a gaming desktop on Black Friday/Cyber Monday so pretty much anything from 999-1100 is preferred.

[b]Specs:[/b]
[spoiler]- NVIDIA GTX 760 2GB
- Intel Core i5 4590 CPU
- 8GB 1600MHz Memory
- 1TB 7200RPM HDD
- ASUS H81 Chipset Motherboard
- 600W Corsair CX Power Supply
- DVD-R/RW/CD-R/RW
- Microsoft Windows 8.1[/spoiler]
My brother bought this computer ($979 version) and it seems to run well, but I have heard from other gamers that with that price the CPU could have been an i7. I want to make sure I am getting the most for my money.</description>

              <p>Long story short, I ordered my video card 17 days ago and their estimated date to receive the next shipment is January 16th. Fuck that, I am not waiting that long for the video card, half of my warranties are midway to expiration and I need this bitch built like yesterday. So now the question becomes, what is the difference between the three 970 videocards? I don’t care about the price anymore, I just want the damn card.</p>

<p>The games I play I will be using a controller, so I’m not really worried about it. BUT, if I were to get pricier a keyboard, what would you recommend that is reasonable?</p>

</aside>
<p>Jumping from a console controller to pc controller is a huge change. Most PC games don’t have aim assist, so while you can still use the controller, you’ll find it is much harder to stay on target until you get those twitch muscles trained. Analog sticks just don’t have the same accuracy as a mouse.</p>
<p>If you want to spend for a pricier keyboard, please make sure it has mechanical switches. I personally use Cherry Blues, but everyone has their own preference. Research a little bit and see what sounds appealing.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I do not play with aim assist on, so that isn’t too much of a worry thanks for the heads up.</p>
<p>Do I need any extra case fans or anything like that to keep the system cool?[/quote]<br>
You’ll want a couple, just make sure they all push air in the same direction. In through the front, out the back for instance. You don’t wan’t all sides pulling air in, but not pushing it out anywhere.</p>

I do not play with aim assist on, so that isn’t too much of a worry thanks for the heads up.</p>

Something gaming grade, programmable buttons, aesthetically designed for prolonged use, but not over priced since you obviously aren’t that concerned about it that much. Also, like Ruby pointed out, mouse makes a bigger difference. (FYI, if you’re playing FPS’s such as CS:GO, you want to throw that controller out, a mouse + keyboard combo will always be more accurate than a controller.)</p>

<p>It really depends on the use-case. Do you want to play Skyrim or BF4 in 1080 on Ultra? Do you want to have a good framerate and responsiveness in online gaming? The graphics card is very important, since this <span class="bbcode-b">is</span> a gaming PC. I think the idea of buying one card and looking forward to later putting it in a dual-card configuration is good, but I’d start with a R9-290x or the equivalent AMD offering.</p>

<p>I’ve also had problems with Seagate. I would recommend WD. They pretty much invented the HDD and have been the most reliable consumer brand in my experience as a home-user and technician. Toshiba and Hitachi are problem my next choices.</p>

<p>You could probably even get the FX-6300 or 8320 and not notice a difference in most games between that or an i5 or i7. Multithreading is going to be used more and more, as well, so the AMD parts will actually improve their price to performance ratio over time.</p>

<p>Secondly, I don’t know about the cooling you’re getting. The stock one is okay if you don’t overclock it, but note it’s going to be LOUD. I got a cheap liquid cooler that keeps it cool and quiet, even under a full load, but then again, what you have picked out might be fine as well.</p>
