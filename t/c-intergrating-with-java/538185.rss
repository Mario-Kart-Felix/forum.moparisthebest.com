<p>Understand the difference between C and C++ linking. JNI is designed to dynamically link to C functions, that is, functions linked by a C compiler or externed with the C language for C++ compilers. The only obvious difference between C and C++ after compile time is name mangling and linking. Since symbols are exported for some functions of dynamic libraries, applications are able to link to them using GetProcAddress, etc. This is pretty easy to implement for something like JNI, but knowing how to mangle the name is rather complicated. Since C defines how naming works at the linking stage in its specification afaik, so coming up with the name of the function is simple compared to if it was mangled.</p>
<p>This is up to quite a bit of conjecture, as I am not entirely sure of the exact workings of GetProcAddress. I am not sure if it works for C++ functions at all.</p>
<p>That being said, obviously you can implement C++ code and create a C binding for it. That’s the way you would do it. If you are conjecturing that anything is C++, that would be very difficult to prove unless they left debug symbols in their binaries, which I highly doubt. The code could have been written in any number of compiled languages. You can make a safe assumption it was probably C++, but how would you know?<br>

Doesn’t C++ only mangle names within objects/namespcaes? I know it’s done to prevent resolution conflicts for function names with in the application, but that mostly arises from the introduction of objects/namespaces - or am I incorrect in this assertion? If I’m correct, then wouldn’t you be able to grab the address of a function as long as it is not encapsulated by an object or inside of a namespace?</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I don’t know much about the C++ language.[/quote]</p>
<p>All names are mangled. There are mangling rules specifically for objects and namespaces, but members in the global namespace are also name-mangled. C, on the other hand, just adds an underscore to the name and a few other very simple rules. Mangling is compiler-dependent and far more complicated in comparison.</p>
