              <p>If all members of a society acted and lived based on solely nature, our population would not survive long. All humans are born evil, whether you agree or disagree. It is up to our environment to educate us so we are able to act based on nurture and nature with equilibrium. Most individuals act based on nurture because it’s the way they have been raised and because they want to suppress their true evil side that is contained within them.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Fat Cookies, post:2, topic:286821”]I personally think nature should always come before nurture because natural responses and actions are done sub-conscientiously and only occur when your brain and body thinks its right. On the other hand Nurture is something that someone’s normally forced into your head, so you end up trying to think about something and waste so much energy doing a simple task. Normally this involves trying to physically stop yourself doing something natural.[/quote]I totally agree. Nurture doesn’t necessarily mean anything good. It’s a way of raising, so if you were raised to be racist, you’re going to be racist. Say you were born on an island with no other race; naturally you wouldn’t be racist because you wouldn’t know anything about another race.</p>
<p>You basically catch on to anything you’re taught via nurture, and fate takes you via nature. So, learn the truth on your own, or risk being mislead?..</p>
<p>Answering the OP though–<br>
Sadly, everyone is influenced by the media, their parents, and everything else that comes appealing to them. As long as a higher power gives them the nurturing, it’s “right”.</p>
