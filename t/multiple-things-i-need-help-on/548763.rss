    <description>my ::update command works fine, but if i type in ::update 300 it will say 4 or so minutes and it will kill the server in 30 seconds. If anyone know what is wrong here please let me know. Thanks

Also i have a sacred clay bow and it works like a bow would but it gets up strength and attack and it doesn&#39;t use arrows. Can anyone point me in the right direction with this?

Another thing i am having trouble with is, Special restore potion, says you restored your spec but it doesn&#39;t and it doesn&#39;t take (1) away from the full potion. If no one knows this one it&#39;s okay, its not my top priority, thanks again for your help :)</description>

              <p>Post your update command.</p>
<p>Search for the bow in your item definitions file, aka itemdefinitions.cfg (or whatever it’s called for you) and change the stats there to what you want them to be. As for the arrows, you need to add the item id of the bow to the group of other bow ids in their respective methods in your CombatAssistant.java (or wherever your combat is handled).</p>
<p>As for the special restore potion, search for the item id in your Potions.java (or wherever it’s handled for you) and make it restore the special there. If the case isn’t there already for the item id, then make it.</p>
