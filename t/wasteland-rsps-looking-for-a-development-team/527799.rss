    <title>Wasteland RSPS - Looking for a development team!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wasteland-rsps-looking-for-a-development-team/527799</link>
    <description>[center][img]http://i40.tinypic.com/2817eau.png[/img][/center]

[center]It&#39;s been a while since I haven&#39;t touched RSPS so i&#39;ve decided to start a brand new RSPS. My previous server was successful and I would like this to be the same, I&#39;m looking for a development team which can help me bring this RSPS to the max level! I&#39;m a good developer but still i&#39;m not a perfect one. I&#39;m making this RSPS for educational purposes because making RSPS for money wouldn&#39;t get your server anywhere. I will be paying the development team once the server is making progress and making donations. So let&#39;s get started![/center]

[center][size=18pt][b][u]Goals[/u][/b][/size][/center]
[center]- My first goal is to make the server very stable so it can hold a lot of players without buying or having a very expensive hardware such as VPS or Dedicated server.
- My second goal is to make the server 100% dupe free so there will be no economy resets, rollbacks &amp; etc. This will make a very good economy.
- My third goal is to fix all bugs/glitches we can find on the server so the game will be flawless.
- My fourth goal is to add atleast 5 bosses &amp; 5 minigames in order for players to enjoy the game.
- My fifth goal is to add a fair amount of training locations in order for players to train and level up easily.
- My sixth goal is to establish a good &amp; friendly community in order for players to interact or communicate with others easily and freely.
- My seventh goal is to have a good staff &amp; development team.
- My eight goal is to make this server successful.
- My ninth goal is to add more unique/cool features &amp; extra benefits for players to enjoy the game.
- My tenth goal is to make the server 100% free to play, you don&#39;t need to pay for items, ranks &amp; etc.[/center]
