    <title>What&#39;s going to happen?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-going-to-happen/387326</link>
    <description>So a week or two ago, this guy I&#39;m acquaintances with came up to me and said he stole an iPod Touch and locked himself out and needed me to try and fix it for him. I don&#39;t really like him so all I did was charge it. I did however, try to restore it, but that didn&#39;t work, so I said &quot;Fuck it&quot;, gave it back to him, and didn&#39;t here about it for a week, until now. On Friday, I got called down to the dreaded principal&#39;s office and they found the iPod (the acquaintance gave it to someone else and for some reason my name was mentioned multiple times when they were questioned). The principal is an alright guy mostly, so he said he would try and clear my name and help me get out of this, but I&#39;m probably going to get in trouble. What is going to happen? I&#39;ve got a spotless record. I definitely don&#39;t want this showing up on it. :| Do you think I&#39;ll get in trouble? If so, I&#39;m fucked.</description>

<p>I’m pretty sure if I write graffiti on playground equipment and don’t get fined, you aren’t going to get fined for charging an iPod.   :|[/quote]</p>
<p>At first they thought I assisted in stealing the iPod, then I told them what actually went down, and they were just kind of like “Oh…” and I was free to go but I’ll probably get pulled back in once more. They told me I’d probably get into trouble BEFORE I told them what actually happened so maybe I’m good.</p>
