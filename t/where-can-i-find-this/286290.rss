    <title>Where can I find this</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-can-i-find-this/286290</link>
    <description>Hello,
   I am  editing my server and I need to know how to change what it says for like the title of the quest tab. Like for my title is says &quot;Universal X&quot;, and where the quests would be it says all the quests. Can anyone help me with where I would be able to find them. I looked for them under client.java, player.java, and playerhandler.java (I have been looking in my source files for this). Soo if anyone could tell me where I would be able to find them that would be great. 

Thanks!</description>
