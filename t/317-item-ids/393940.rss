    <description>Ok so i have a huge list of item id&#39;s that are in my client. not all of them are in my server (sadface). and there are also some duplicates. what i wanted to know is if anyone has a program that can re organize the id&#39;s so they go from 1 to ##### (##### being the highest number) because id like to know what id&#39;s i do and do not have.</description>

<p>No. You would have to create a program yourself for organizing things in your class file. It wouldn’t be that hard, but you’d also have to look in the cache for items that are duplicated(in Class8 along with the cache).</p>
