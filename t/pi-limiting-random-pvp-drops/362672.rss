    <title>[PI]Limiting Random PvP drops</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-limiting-random-pvp-drops/362672</link>
    <description>Im on a PI base and i added random PvP drops when you kill players, but since these drops are pretty generous, what is a way i can prevent players from &quot;farming&quot; to get a bunch of free items,

like something to block someone from killing another account on the same ip, or both players have to be risking a certain amount for loot or something to stop people from abusing this</description>

              <p>Make it so for every milestone you get a bit more, but the price is always random.</p>
<p>Let’s say you kill someone with full bandos and bandos is worth 50m. Well it will give you drops that are from one coin to 55m, giving you massive amounts of gain and massive amounts of loss if you happen to just farm! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>You would do this by creating a file through XML, SQL, or maybe just a notepad document that contains all the prices for commonly used items. Then make it so when the person drops their items, it gets the value of the persons dropped items, then takes a random amount of that as how much it will drop. Then it uses that to determine how much PvP reward it will drop.</p>
<p>This requires knowledge of HowToUseNotepad / HowToUseMysql, JDBC / BufferedReader, ArrayLists / Arrays, for(), random, HowToCodeJava etc.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
