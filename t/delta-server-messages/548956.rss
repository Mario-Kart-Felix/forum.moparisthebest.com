    <description>I&#39;m not too sure if I could do this on my server, but I know private servers that have a notification box that appears for a few second and disapears and might have a message from a staffmember or just shouting out an achievement or somthing along those lines.  Right now mine is running as a &quot;::yell&quot; command which is pretty bad and would like to update it where like notification box comes up to all the players.

[code]        if (command.startsWith(&quot;message&quot;) &amp;&amp; command.length() &gt; 8
                &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 2) { 
            String text = command.substring(8); 
            c.yell(&quot;@red@[SERVER]:  &quot; + Character.toUpperCase(text.charAt(0)) 
                    + text.substring(1)); 
        } [/code]
I know its so basic and thats why I want to update it. I&#39;m sure theres a tutorial out there, but again I don&#39;t know the proper name for what this is called. Its like a player notification that comes up from the chat box but its not in the chatbox, its right above it, and then goes away after a few seconds.</description>
