    <title>Third high revelation! (This one came quick)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/third-high-revelation-this-one-came-quick/396605</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I smoked about 4 rocks of nugs today and I was thinking about you guys and how to help you out and me cause im getting a lawsuit from a player for supposedly getting his account banned and I went into a lawyer mode and created this new law which exists already.


&lt;blockquote&gt;All consumers are obligated to read the Terms of service, rules, instructions, manuals prior to operating a product if the consumer does not abide by that law then no other party may be held accountable for anything that may go wrong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this law you can never be sued for selling hacks, providing power leveling services, etc.
This law is a loop hole where neither party can win because both parties are equally at fault.

Stay tuned for future weed revelations, exclusive from pkedpker!</description>

              <p>First off I just wanna say thanks for my fan there ytui09, I’m sorry, defending me must have cost you a reputation point as I can see but what can you do… these people don’t like to hear the truth for some reason yet at the same time when they get caught in the same predicament they will remember me and my revelations.</p>
<p>Alright so let’s say a person buys a saw from a hardware store and this guy never used one before in his life, he does not read the instructions and cuts off his hand because he didn’t know how to use the safety switch properly, that company who manufactured the saw cannot be held responsible for that because they had a safety method in place which the guy could have used to prevent the situation if he had only read the instructions.</p>
<p>Same thing applies to my revelation, if you provide a powerleveling service to somebody and that person gets banned, you cannot be held responsible for compensating him on the lost account, lost time, lost virtual goods, AND even providing the person with a refund for the powerleveling service you provided as the service has already been completed all because of the law in place, when you sign up for an account you agree to the terms of service, by agreeing you acknowledge that you read and agree to abide by the terms set forth, by not doing so you and you alone are taking the risks involved by going against the terms of service and no one may be held accountable for your actions.</p>
<p>You guys can call me stupid but I can give thousands of examples of how this will win any court case because even the cigarette companies are not responsible (now at least, since they starting printing warnings on the labels) if a person does from cancel from smoking.</p>

How could you say such a thing? As I’ve already pointed in my previous post, OP is just trying to enlighten us with knowledge, and he has exceeded marvelously at that. I have already won <span class="bbcode-b">7 whole court cases</span> using just this tip! I can’t wait till OP posts more of his obviously genius revelations.</p>

<p>Sure I am in fault for powerleveling him and he deserves a refund from me… But I won’t give me any money… You know why?  because first of all he got my service he got banned a week later I already am not held responsible for this. Because he knew the powerleveling is cheating and still bought it so he in a way knew exactly what he was getting himself into and disobeying the game tos by sharing his password which is already against the TOS.</p>
<p>Don’t you see the counterclaim here and how solid it really is.</p>
<p>So if it gets to court it will just be dismissed and he will pay my court fees too…</p>
<p>Just trying to make a logical point. It’s extremely logical if you look at it… how can it fail? flawless. (I’ll look at it when I wake up, but I don’t see anything wrong with it).</p>
<p>You guys just like to fail people… who are not active on the forum or contributing something idk.</p>

              <p>Wow thank you for revealing this astonishing law that is upheld by everyone on the internet, I will now be abusing this loop hole to create massive gold farming sites for various different games that Jagex cannot sue me on. You have opened my mind to the sekrets of the internet and I will be posting my results very soon!</p>

              <p>Firstly, stop posting these, they might sound sort of good when you are high, but how about you wait until you are sober and can see how stupid they are before you post them.</p>
<p>Also, how is that a ‘law’ by any stretch of the imagination?</p>

              <p>Hey guys, I smoked about 4 rocks of nugs today and I was thinking about you guys and how to help you out and me cause im getting a lawsuit from a player for supposedly getting his account banned and I went into a lawyer mode and created this new law which exists already.</p>
<blockquote>All consumers are obligated to read the Terms of service, rules, instructions, manuals prior to operating a product if the consumer does not abide by that law then no other party may be held accountable for anything that may go wrong.</blockquote>
<p>With this law you can never be sued for selling hacks, providing power leveling services, etc.<br>
This law is a loop hole where neither party can win because both parties are equally at fault.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for future weed revelations, exclusive from pkedpker!</p>
