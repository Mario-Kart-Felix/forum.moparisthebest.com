    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hacking-some-flash-games-5-easy-steps/113009</link>
    <description>First you need to download cheat engine-- Cheat Engine V5.3


this will not work with all games like runescape(it will change the money but when you go bank it trade it or buy with it it will return to its original money)

Once you have downloaded it do this.


1.goto the green glowy thing in the left hand corner (top) and find iexplorer or something like that


2.then, look at the score you want to change, take it times 8 and write it in the value box, press first scan


3.now, there will be alot of adresses, what you need to do is increase or decrease the score and take it times 8(ex. say it was money, buy something or sell something) and write the new score in the value box and press next scan and it should come up with 1 address and if not change the score and scan again until there is one left


4.double click the only one left and it will appear on the bottom address list


5.double click the area that the number value is in (at the bottom) and a box with that number should appear and change the score to something like 80000 but not too high and it has to be a multiple of 8 and presto it should work(if it doesnt try again but this time check the box that says frozen or freeze)
