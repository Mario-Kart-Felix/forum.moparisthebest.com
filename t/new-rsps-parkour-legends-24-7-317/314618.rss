Server Information





Range



- Projectiles - 100%

* We Spent hours perfecting projectile speed, slope, and hit ratio. If your further away the arrow will go faster and slope at a different angle, if you turn and go a dirrect direction the arrow will follow you to your spot.



- Speed &amp; Specials. - 100%

* Range speed has been perfected in 2speced, we spent awhile browsing forums and testing formulas but we got it perfect to rs speeds.



- Damage Ratio. - 100%

* The Formula we used is just about as close to runescape as you could get, after browsing their forums and many others, including using formulas from fan-site calculators we have perfected the damage for range better than any other server.



Magic



- Spells - 100%

* All spells will work (With the exception of a few non-combat ones such as tele-other, and things like enchant ring). Lunar spells have been added aswell, including vengeance, heal other, heal group, and many more.



- Projectiles - 100%

* Pretty much the same deal with range, we have perfected the speeds\slopes of all spells, they follow you where ever you go.



- Teleports 

* Teleports have been added into the game but they are different from runecape, they teleport you to specific areas such as training grounds, minigames, and various other places aswell.



- Timers

* In most servers you find now a days they allow massing (Ex: Barraging then hitting directly after with whip), I Hated that so we have perfected it so the timers in parkour legends are 100% to runescape, if you cast a spell then click to cast another one, it will wait untill your done then cast again (Exactly like rs) And this goes for Range and melee comboing aswell. (Meaning if you whip someone or range someone then cast a spell before during or after you hit it will still wait the alloted time then cast the spell.)



Melee



Melee Is the only skill we have not redone yet, but don&#39;t worry its comming very soon!





Mini-Games





Fight Pits

- Fight pits 100%

* We have made fight pits 100% to rs, i have never seen another server with fight pits as close to rs as the one we made.

* The timers are 100% (I Went into runescape and timed with a stopwatch)

* If fight goes on for to long The tzhaar monsters will come out to finish it for you, if that fails you will be hit by a barrage of 1s until there is only one standing.

* Tokul reward just like rs, you can buy rewards from a shop aswell.





Unfinished/Not Completed (Will be added when they are completed)





Pest Control

- Pest Control 90%

* With Waiting Boat with The Correct interface that shows how many players and time untill next departure.

* Boat will wait untill there is 5-25 players to start the timer, if there is more than 25 it will automatically start the match.

* Portals, NPCvNPC, ALL Pest Control NPCs, Zeal points (Damage you do while in-game).

* Although we will make this as close to rs as possible we can&#39;t make it so there is an unlimited amount of games at once (For now) So only 3 games will be allowed to be played simultainously.

* You get points for winning a game and you can exchange them at the shop just like in rs, for either Void armour or combat XP.



Castle Wars

-Castle Wars 0%

*Not Started yet.


and more for urs !!!!
