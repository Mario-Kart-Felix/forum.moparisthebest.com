    <description>btw tacos=spiders (posted on 420chan)

Last night I took 32 benadryl 25mg each. I weigh 280 lbs.

I first took the pills on my computer, alone in my room. I was slightly nervous, but overall my mindset was delirium, so I wasnt too worried. After about 15-20 minutes, I began to feel a slight warmness in my face, and looked at my hands. the tops of my hands were distorted. the best way I can discribe this is like the molecules in my hand were moving around, (not melting, but kinda boiling) I laughed at this, and kept listening to music and stuff.

About 10 minutes later, a taco crawled out of my keyboard onto my hand. at first, that shit scared me, but I realized &quot;lol tacos&quot; and smashed it. i felt victorious, yet I was wrong. tacos began falling from the ceiling from webs, and I was fucking petrified. i ran into my living room, and got a can of bug spray, and sprayed my whole fucking room down. For about 20 minutes, they were gone. I went into the living room to listen to music a bit louder. I sat there for 10 minutes, the whole time shit around me was melting, my legs were melting, my heart was racing, I was completely petrified. I saw my family in the kitchen, and I said &quot;hi mom&quot; and she dissapeared. INTO THIN AIR. then I got up and walked over there, and my dad, brother, and cat all fucking dissapeared. this scared me.

after about an hour in the living room, I was starting to realize that I was on drugs, and this wasnt real. I calmed down a bit, and then my parents came home. my mom came in my room to say hi, and looked at me and realized my pupils were like saucers, so she told me to lay down, and put a washclothe on my head (i was very hot) I layed there for about 25 minutes till I passed out.

about an 20 minutes later, I woke up. i thought it was morning, turned out I was asleep for about 20 minutes. At first, I didnt feel like I was on anything. no hallucinations, no nothing. I was so relieved I thought it was over. IT WASNT. after about 5 minutes on the computer, my hands began melting again. my feet were swarmed by fleas/gnats/cockroaches. at first I nearly shit myself, but then realizing &quot;lol delerium&quot; i started smashing them with my feet. after about 3 minutes of insect smashing, they dissapeared. i was exhausted, and nearly in euphoria as I felt i defeated my fear of insects. i went into my bathroom to take a piss, when I looked in the mirror, their were 2 shadow faces in the mirror. that did it for me, I was lolling because I finally had control and could tell what I was doing. I knew they were fake, so I just went into my room. I layed down, it was about 1-2 in the morning. I was laying their, felt as if I was spinning on an axis. after about 25 minutes of spinning, I was asleep.

EDIT: as the days pass I remember more and more that happend 

i remember that after about 40 minutes the drug had taken affect, i started hearing knocks at my door and people were ringing my doorbell every 5-10 minutes. everytime I looked out my window, i saw kids in costumes, like they were trick or treating. this went on most of the night. kids would walk to my door with pillow cases and buckets and shit for candy. i assumed it was halloween, in july.



has anyone else here tried diphenhydramine? if so, what sights/sounds did you experience?

I WOULD LIKE TO SAY NOW, I DO NOT SUGGEST ANYONE TO TRY THIS. IT MAKES YOU INSANE FOR ABOUT 6 HOURS. you really need to have experience when trying this drug, it isnt a joke. underestimating this drug could leave you mentally scarred, lawl.</description>

<p>You don’t get it. There is enough medicine but because people abuse them and use it to make other drugs, they limit everyones supply to try to keep abuse down.</p>

<p>Well, they do not supply them on the shelves anymore because of people like him. You have to ask the Pharmacist to get it for you, then you have to give them your I.D. and sign a paper stating it is for medical use. Then you can’t buy anymore than like 4 boxes in a few month period.</p>

              <p>btw tacos=spiders (posted on 420chan)</p>
<p>Last night I took 32 benadryl 25mg each. I weigh 280 lbs.</p>
<p>I first took the pills on my computer, alone in my room. I was slightly nervous, but overall my mindset was delirium, so I wasnt too worried. After about 15-20 minutes, I began to feel a slight warmness in my face, and looked at my hands. the tops of my hands were distorted. the best way I can discribe this is like the molecules in my hand were moving around, (not melting, but kinda boiling) I laughed at this, and kept listening to music and stuff.</p>
<p>About 10 minutes later, a taco crawled out of my keyboard onto my hand. at first, that shit scared me, but I realized “lol tacos” and smashed it. i felt victorious, yet I was wrong. tacos began falling from the ceiling from webs, and I was fucking petrified. i ran into my living room, and got a can of bug spray, and sprayed my whole fucking room down. For about 20 minutes, they were gone. I went into the living room to listen to music a bit louder. I sat there for 10 minutes, the whole time shit around me was melting, my legs were melting, my heart was racing, I was completely petrified. I saw my family in the kitchen, and I said “hi mom” and she dissapeared. INTO THIN AIR. then I got up and walked over there, and my dad, brother, and cat all fucking dissapeared. this scared me.</p>
<p>after about an hour in the living room, I was starting to realize that I was on drugs, and this wasnt real. I calmed down a bit, and then my parents came home. my mom came in my room to say hi, and looked at me and realized my pupils were like saucers, so she told me to lay down, and put a washclothe on my head (i was very hot) I layed there for about 25 minutes till I passed out.</p>
<p>about an 20 minutes later, I woke up. i thought it was morning, turned out I was asleep for about 20 minutes. At first, I didnt feel like I was on anything. no hallucinations, no nothing. I was so relieved I thought it was over. IT WASNT. after about 5 minutes on the computer, my hands began melting again. my feet were swarmed by fleas/gnats/cockroaches. at first I nearly shit myself, but then realizing “lol delerium” i started smashing them with my feet. after about 3 minutes of insect smashing, they dissapeared. i was exhausted, and nearly in euphoria as I felt i defeated my fear of insects. i went into my bathroom to take a piss, when I looked in the mirror, their were 2 shadow faces in the mirror. that did it for me, I was lolling because I finally had control and could tell what I was doing. I knew they were fake, so I just went into my room. I layed down, it was about 1-2 in the morning. I was laying their, felt as if I was spinning on an axis. after about 25 minutes of spinning, I was asleep.</p>
<p>EDIT: as the days pass I remember more and more that happend</p>
<p>i remember that after about 40 minutes the drug had taken affect, i started hearing knocks at my door and people were ringing my doorbell every 5-10 minutes. everytime I looked out my window, i saw kids in costumes, like they were trick or treating. this went on most of the night. kids would walk to my door with pillow cases and buckets and shit for candy. i assumed it was halloween, in july.</p>
<p>has anyone else here tried diphenhydramine? if so, what sights/sounds did you experience?</p>
<p>I WOULD LIKE TO SAY NOW, I DO NOT SUGGEST ANYONE TO TRY THIS. IT MAKES YOU INSANE FOR ABOUT 6 HOURS. you really need to have experience when trying this drug, it isnt a joke. underestimating this drug could leave you mentally scarred, lawl.</p>
