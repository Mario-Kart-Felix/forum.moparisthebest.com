    <title>What&#39;s a good VPS?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-a-good-vps/403417</link>
    <description>Ok I made a bet with my brother last night that if he didn&#39;t get the 4th prestige even though he was at 3rd 49  by 2:30 ( He had 1 hr and a half to do it. ) Anyway the bet was that if I won he had to buy me a VPS and if he won i had to give him $20.00. I wanted to know what was the cheapest and best VPS.</description>
