    <title>Npc death</title>

    <description>Okay when you die to a npc like lets say a boss &quot;Nomad&quot; it drops your items your wearing &amp; your inventory items &amp; you only keep 3 items on death.

Also when you go back for your items you lost it does not show your items you had in inventory or what you was wearing on the floor.

I want it so when you die to a npc you don&#39;t lose items your wearing or in inventory.

If not that I want it so when you die to a npc it only shows your ground items you lost.

Also my ::kdr shows npc deaths along with pvp deaths</description>
