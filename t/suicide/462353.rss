<p><a class="mention-group" href="/groups/everyone">@everyone</a> against suicide<br>
If they go now or in 50 years, what’s the difference?<br>
We all end up the same, so if some one doesn’t want to wait that long to get out of here then what’s the big deal.</p>

Bullshit. That is what life is, an infinite promise that someday life will get better. But it doesn't get better. If you are able to fuck it up when you had a good chance of success, why should you believe that you should be able to fix your life when the chances are slimmer?

I believe suicide is just completely ignorant. People need to really grasp the fact that this world is full of many different people; some people may be nice, but others are just waiting to put a stake into your heart, simply because that is what make them happy. As long as you care about your future and your happiness, you should push those people away from you and do your best because you only have one life.<br>

<p>People who commit suicide sicken me if I’m honest. It’s not bad enough to take your own life, it never is. A lot of people commit at a young age(teens) and its just idiotic. They have their entire life to go through and after high school you barely talk to anyone you were there with. Taking your own life proves how weak you are; no matter how much someone bullies you or how hard it is at home there’s always help available and for them to take their own life is just silly, it’s incredibly selfish. There’s always people who care so get a grip and wait it out.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Depends on the circumstances.  If someone is being tortured, how are they selfish for wanting out?  Whether it be mentally or physically, it shouldn’t matter, their life is their business and if they want to rid of it them let them.  The reason I say it’s not is because it’s more than likely even more selfish to force a family member to stay alive if he really wants to die.  Think about it, it’s a way to end his/her suffering for good.  Even if there’s good down the raod, that doesn’t mean they can bare the journey.</p>
<p>Though I do agree that allot of the teens committing suicide are stupid because of the fact that they’re so young, and they have a much better life ahead of them just because of the freedom they get alone.</p>

<p>Maybe their whole life ahead is ruined because of someone else? What if they had no chance at doing what they dream because of their stature. I would kill myself if there wasn’t much left.</p>
<p>I actually tried to commit suicide and my mother just watched. I think suicide is something that says “I hate my life.” I don’t think it’s selfish but something to get attention.</p>

In the grand scale of things everything is pointless, it just happened to come into existence one day.  The only real point is to continue on our lives.  Despite us being pointless, that doesn’t mean we can’t enrich out lives with happiness while we’re still alive, witch is probably the reason we’ve come so far and done so much to planet itself, because it prevents people from dying so suddenly and prevents rather pointless deaths.</p>
<p>I suppose what I’m trying to say is that there is no reason nor point that we exist, but as long as we do we might as well make the best of it, because someday, it will all be gone.</p>

We destroy things on the planet because we were made in the same way as all other life here was.  Whether it actually be from a god or from long years of evolution, we all got here in an extremely similar fashion.</p>
<p>One of the basic things that every living thing knows is survival of the fittest.  If we developed the intellect to enhance our lives, then why shouldn’t we do it?  The planet itself will exist for billions of more years, there’s no way for us to destroy it, but we can wipe out the life that it has, because we’re currently the dominate species.  As long as we live, we can use what brain power we have to enjoy our lives in the best way possible.</p>
<p>Not only that, but there are billions of other planets out there and with that billions of possibilities for other organic life, if one planet becomes devoid of life, there are possibly millions others to replace it.  Life is fairly irrelevant to the universe itself anyways.</p>

If a film was horrible and you couldn’t stand it, you’d walk out of it. If it genuinely upset you, someone forcing you to stay would be selfish.<br>

Then your friend would be selfish.  If everyone wanted you to jump off a cliff, would you?  As stated before, it’s your life, not theirs.</p>
