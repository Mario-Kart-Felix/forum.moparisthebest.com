    <description>[u]Solumstone&#39;s Location List[/u]

Attached is a list of useful locations that can be used in your server. We will be continually updating the list, so don&#39;t fret if you cant find what you need. If you have questions we will be happy to Support and Help you. If you want to join the team, fill out the form below, and I will PM you when the site is up and running. Then, you can register there and we&#39;ll put you to work!

[u]Application Form[/u]

Name:
Job:                    
Server IP:

(We&#39;re looking for coders, graphic designers, server hosts (to Run test servers) brain stormers and anything that cane be used to help. I&#39;m also looking for Moderators for the site (when it is completed). Server IP is not required but is preferred. If you have a site, can you place it in brackets after Server IP.

[u]Future Updates[/u]
We hope to get some basic tutorials for beginners up (Guides to clients, sources and servers) as well as continually updating guides we already have.

[u]Final New[/u]
This is a big project, as I hope that it will help many people, so the more skilled people we can get on the team the better.

Many Thanks,
Syrillia.</description>
