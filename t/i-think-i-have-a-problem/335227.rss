    <title>I think I have a Problem. :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-think-i-have-a-problem/335227</link>
    <description>Well, I really need some help with my java (atleast I think that&#39;s the problem). Whenever I try to open a private server&#39;s .bat file, it says 

[Code]&#39;java&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file.Press any key to continue . . .[/code]

I am able to play RuneScape, but everyone knows how boring RS is. I downloaded JDK 6.18, and I installed it with 0 problems. I just really wanted to know if someone could help me, because I REALLY want to play Private Servers again, and this computer is my only option.

I have set my enviromental variables, but I still can&#39;t play.

If you need to know anything else, just ask. 


Thanks SOO much.
