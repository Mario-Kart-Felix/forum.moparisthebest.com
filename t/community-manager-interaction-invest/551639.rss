    <title>Community Manager/Interaction + Invest</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/community-manager-interaction-invest/551639</link>
    <description>Hey guys I&#39;m 20 years old. I am looking to become a Community Manager (Someone who interacts with the community and is always there if someone needs help)

If the server has the potential I will be willing to invest in a better VPS and/or advertising for the server. Thanks!


Here is a little about myself, if you would like to know more then feel free to contact me.

I have strong communication skills and like to always be updated with the rest of the team as teamwork is a big part within a community. I have a lot of dedication to make sure what I do is done at a good standard. I have a calm attitude which would help deal with different types of people, also I have a passion for providing good community interaction to make the community happy. Most of the time people will go onto a server, try to talk to admins/mods and most of the staff are busy so they are unable to talk much to the community. I have good organizational skills which allows me to do the work I need to do and make the community happy. Also while I interact with the community I believe that they should have a say with what happens within the community/server.

In the terms of jobs/real life, I have been an advisor over the phone and also first line I.T Technician while documenting important information.</description>
