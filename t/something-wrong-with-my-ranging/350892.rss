    <title>Something wrong with my ranging</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/something-wrong-with-my-ranging/350892</link>
    <description>Well, when I attack someone with a bow, it runs towards them, ranges them on the way and it hits instantly. 
How can I make it so that:
a) It ranges them once, and then runs towards them (possibly ranging them on the way)
b) It damages them when the projectile hits them.</description>
