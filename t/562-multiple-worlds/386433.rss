    <title>[562] Multiple Worlds?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-multiple-worlds/386433</link>
    <description>Hi everyone, me and my friends have a 562 server, and we want to have multiple worlds. Right now we are on an rs2hd source. I see the worldlist.java, but when I add a 3rd world as a different port, the client glitches out and stops connecting to ANY server. Even when I switch back to world 1, (After I attempted to connect to world 3) it gives me &quot;Error connecting to server&quot;. (My servers are on, and this does NOT happen if you do not change the world when you first start up the client.) Is there any way to make the worldlist work? I found this thing on a different forum (Don&#39;t wanna get banned so not saying which one) That has worldlist and the &quot;Create Account&quot; button working. It works through mysql. When I try to do it, there is no runserver.bat or anything even looking like it, I even searched for JAR files. Nothing. And also when I try to imput the mysql code into my database, I get an error too. All I want is multiple worlds! Please help!  :confused: :confused:

Edit: Bump... I really need an answer fast... Sorry if I&#39;m being pushy...  :cool:</description>
