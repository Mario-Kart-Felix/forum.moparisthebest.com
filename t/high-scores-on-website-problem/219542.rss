    <title>High Scores on website problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/high-scores-on-website-problem/219542</link>
    <description>I have 100% high scores on my website right,


Well, I don&#39;t want to host the high scores off my PC because that would lag the hell out of my internet with the members I have.


I tried hosting it off of my VPS, but you can&#39;t because Xampp uses port 80, and so does the VPS&#39;s system.

Any one know how I could host my high scores with a free host or something?

DO NOT recommend http://www.byethost.com/

Gayest host there is.</description>
