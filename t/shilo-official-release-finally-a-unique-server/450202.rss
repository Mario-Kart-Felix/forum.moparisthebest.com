It is my absolute pleasure to announce the official FULL RELEASE of Shilo, the most unique server out there. ;)

[I]I&#39;m so fucking excited.[/I]

&gt;&gt;&gt; [URL=http://www.shilovillage.com/play/][COLOR=Red][SIZE=4]WEBCLIENT LINK[/SIZE][/COLOR][/URL] &lt;&lt;&lt;

[URL=http://forum.shilovillage.com/][B]forums[/B][/URL] - [COLOR=Red]you must register to play[/COLOR]
[URL=http://highscores.shilovillage.com/][B]highscores[/B][/URL]

I&#39;ve been working on Shilo for months, and I can finally say the release is here. The full, official release. No resets. No wipes. No bullshit. This server is completely economy and player based. Completely. It&#39;s so economy based that there should even be a market for bronze, iron, and steel armor. There are no shops, minus tools being sold in the General Store and a Fishing supply store. You&#39;ve got to mine your ore, smith your bars and equipment, fletch your bows and arrows, cook your food... Or buy it from someone else who already has.

[quote=&quot;Lin&quot;]Sadly, I never played this server very much, but it was great from what I did play. I recommend it.[/quote]

Seeing as the media is pretty outdated and I really don&#39;t want to take any pictures at the moment, here&#39;s a list of the features the set Shilo apart from the rest of the servers out there.

[ul][*]Unique starting location of Shilo Village (the village is fully developed)
[*]Confined server areas, limited to only areas developed -You&#39;ll always be interacting with someone else
[*]Dungeons and islands to explore
[*]Two FULLY CUSTOM quests (many more to come soon, I&#39;ve made a simple quest system that allows me to add quests easily) - I&#39;ve put a solid amount of time into these
[*]Dueling anywhere - Right click, challenge, stake &#39;em and kill &#39;em
[*]Challenging BOSSES - As of 7/18/12, two bosses are available: the Jungle Savage and the Black Demon
[*]Monsters everywhere to train on, with working aggression and auto retaliate
[*]Fully developed skill bases for every skill (as of 7/18/12, Herblore, Agility, Slayer, and Farming aren&#39;t developed yet)
[list]
[*]Combat is fantastic, with working melee, magic, range, and prayer
[*]Mining and smithing are as good as can be
[*]Woodcutting and fletching are the same
[*]Fishing and cooking working perfectly as well
[*]Runecrafting works perfectly, not all runes are added yet as of 7/18/12
[*]Crafting is great, with leather and green d&#39;hide crafting currently (as of 7/18/12)
[*]Thieving is working well, although currently pickpocketing of Men and Farmers is the only way to train it (as of 7/18/12)
[/list]
[*]Great highscores ^_^
[*]Custom locations for basically everything, ex. altars, rocks, trees, etc.
[*]Lack of shops, like explained before, which will hopefully create a great economy. The goal is to have supply/demand for almost EVERYTHING, including low leveled items
[*]Friendly community (of course) with carefully selected staff hehehe ^^[/ul]


[SIZE=3]Media[/SIZE]
[I]Some of this media is either of unreleased content and/or changed content.[/I]

[I]The house where you begin your journey.[/I]

[I]The Jungle Forester&#39;s transportation system.[/I]

[I]Custom underground mining site.[/I]

[IMG]http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2hf8z96h11r0qwido1_1280.png[/img]
[I]One of the many areas to explore. Watch out for the green dragons, bro![/I]

[IMG]http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2hfng1GQ01r0qwido1_1280.png[/img]
[I]The picture doesn&#39;t show much, but runecrafting is working really well.[/I]

[IMG]http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2hfq7Pr7K1r0qwido1_1280.png[/img]
[I]One of the places you can go above-ground outside of Shilo Village. The Jungle Forester can take you here.[/I]

[IMG]http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2l86dRR0z1r0qwido1_1280.png[/img]
[I]Climb your way to new areas ;)[/I]

[IMG]http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2l896DoQX1r0qwido1_1280.png[/img]
[I]Take a nice little raft ride to explore further into the caves. This stream/raft will take you to the underground mining site. It just teleports you, but you can imagine the ride.[/I]

[IMG]http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2l8aoEUjk1r0qwido1_1280.png[/img]
[I]Explore your way to the lairs of difficult bosses.[/I]

[IMG]http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2of90orVO1r0qwido1_1280.png[/img]
[I]Runecrafting isn&#39;t shown because I&#39;ve already posted a picture of it and smithing/fletching aren&#39;t shown either. And obviously combat. But those are all there[/I] ;)

You guys may have been following this project or you may have even played the Alpha, but this is the real deal. You&#39;re going to have to register on the forums in order to play, and login using your forum details on the official Shilo Client.

The server is honestly fun even with a small amount of people on, but the more the merrier. Help me get the word around about Shilo. Let&#39;s make this one of the greatest servers to exist! Well, maybe that&#39;s a lot to ask, but let&#39;s make it a fun one &lt;3</description>

              <p>10 reasons to join Shilo:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1:</span> Truly old school<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">2:</span> Developed always with a true economy in mind (steel has a market)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">3:</span> Forum/server integration<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">4:</span> Professionally made. Nothing is half-arsed<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">5:</span> Originality; quests have an interesting and lengthy dialogue. Not just “do this, do that”<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">6:</span> Always see other players, even with a low online count. Areas released when developed/more players active<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">7:</span> Not governed by corruption/immaturity. Staff is at the right ratio and not full of wannabes<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">8:</span> Diversity. Thieving holds an array of items, nostalgic monsters, everyone has different equipment (not all running around in full rune/whips)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">9:</span> Seems stable. No real lag or disconnection issues<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">10:</span> Exploration; looking for that feeling of adventure you once had when you first started RS back in the day? Play some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9wnuZoK090" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">nostalgia</a> and have fun discovering</p>
<p>The advertisement is very underrated. The game-play truly reveals how great the server is.</p>

<p>Instead of 20 exp per hit you get 40. Instead of 125 for cutting a log you get 250… Dude I think this is one of the only servers with an experience rate that’s low like that. Minus 2006scape, but we don’t talk about that.</p>
