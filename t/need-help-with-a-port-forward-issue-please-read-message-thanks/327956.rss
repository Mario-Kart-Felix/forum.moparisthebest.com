    <description>Hey guys well when i was my dads house i could port forward and play on my server fine.

But at my moms i cant im having trouble port forwarding, at my dads I port forwarded easy with D-Link.

But here i use linksys and now i can&#39;t port forward, where it says 192.168.1.[number here],

i have to put in a number but i cant, if i put in 1 itll say can use the routers IP, but if i use 0 i know what probably wont do anything, and then when i put that in and SAVE the settings, i go back and its not there! it didn&#39;t even save! i don&#39;t know what to do, can some body please help me?

I&#39;ve tried utorrent, but that didn&#39;t work either

Thanks in advance.</description>
