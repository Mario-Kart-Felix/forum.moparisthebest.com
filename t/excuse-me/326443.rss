    <title>Excuse me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/excuse-me/326443</link>
    <description>Pretty sure the American cars are #1.
Last time I checked, fastest, best handling PRODUCTION CAR (this means it&#39;s made in a factory with enough cars being made to be considered production) is the Corvette ZR1. Discuss.

Plus my car will poop on any europeans car, don&#39;t care if it&#39;s only in a strait line or if I spend more money on fuel when my car idles then when you are at 7,000 RPM.</description>

<p>It was fastest round the Nürburgring for a production car indeed, a Lotus or Atom couldn’t touch it on raw speed I agree. Obviously power outweighs handling in a race. Despite this if you look at actual purpose built racers the European cars dominate the leaderboards. The fact is, we do manage to get more bhp out of smaller engines, but in doing so we increase costs hence why our best cars are at the top of the boards but are too expensive to be mass produced.</p>
<p>America are now in F1 and for me this is going to be the real competition, although when I mentioned this in another thread the Americans seemed uninterested. Kind of stupid really, F1 is at the forefront of racing, and no doubt you’ll have more money to throw at it than us. I mean, even BMW withdrew from F1 this year, so economic crisis has left the sport open to the taking of any team willing to put the effort in.</p>

<p>Wikipedia’s lap time board also confirms this. 700bhp out of 4.2l engine is pretty intense and so is the price tag.</p>

<p>Throwing forced induction on a small engine to get big numbers is not an achievement. The ZR1 is the only car up on the leaderboard that can be driven every day, besides the GTR. The Apollo is just a race car for the streets, and cannot be driven every day like a GTR or ZR1 can.</p>

Well I know what I read but the only knowledge I can back up is my hands on experience of motors, the only suspension I know how to set up is that of a car built to go in a strait line. Other then that I just assume what I read is true.</p>

<p>Not impressed by that. Any company can take a car with a severely over-worked set of heads and some form of forced induction to achieve power like that.</p>
<p>I have a few problems with the Ariel Atom, first off they don’t make enough to classify as a real production vehicle and second that thing in no way resembles a car. It’s open wheel wells and has a tube chassis, their is almost no place atleast in America where that thing is street legal.<br>
Ariel Atom<br>
Production	&lt;100 per year</p>
<p>I am not sure what a mass production vehicle is classified by anymore, in the 60’s it used to be 500 of a vehicle had to be made for it to be a production vehicle. Now with the large increase in cars and drivers I imagine a real production car must be way more then that number.</p>
<p>And I couldn’t find a Lotus that actually outhandled the Corvette at 1.06G on the skidpad. And if you really want to get technical I know nothing will beat the ACR at 1.5G.</p>

Probably all purpose built German and Italian cars too, the corvette is the first car to even get close to European handling, but not close enough.<br>

<p>Then explain why the Dodge Viper ACR still holds the record for the fastest production car on the European Nürburgring?  Which everyone will agree is about as far away from a straight line as you can get.</p>
<p>It’s not debatable that we have the fastest cars in a straight line, but records seem to point to the fact that at least 2 of our vehicles are fastest or near-fastest on road tracks as well.  <span class="bbcode-b">Certainly they are the fastest cars on any type of track for the money.</span>[/quote]<br>
^^Without a doubt in terms of cost.</p>
<p>It was fastest round the Nürburgring for a production car indeed, a Lotus or Atom couldn’t touch it on raw speed I agree. Obviously power outweighs handling in a race. Despite this if you look at actual purpose built racers the European cars dominate the leaderboards. The fact is, we do manage to get more bhp out of smaller engines, but in doing so we increase costs hence why our best cars are at the top of the boards but are too expensive to be mass produced.</p>
<p>America are now in F1 and for me this is going to be the real competition, although when I mentioned this in another thread the Americans seemed uninterested. Kind of stupid really, F1 is at the forefront of racing, and no doubt you’ll have more money to throw at it than us. I mean, even BMW withdrew from F1 this year, so economic crisis has left the sport open to the taking of any team willing to put the effort in.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT: Actually the Gumpert Apollo is a production car and thats over 10 seconds faster than the Dodge. The Radical is actually the fastest but it’s widely debated that its not a production car, and in my opinion it isn’t</span>.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of sources stating this: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/08/18/gumpert-apollo-sport-sets-new-production-car-lap-record-at-nur/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.autoblog.com/2009/08/18/gumpert-apollo-sport-sets-new-production-car-lap-record-at-nur/</a></p>
<p>Wikipedia’s lap time board also confirms this. 700bhp out of 4.2l engine is pretty intense and so is the price tag.</p>

<p>But it’s not just the interiors, it’s the body as well. I can’t remember if it was a corvette I saw or what, but when you leaned on the back or sides, the panels were such a thin plastic they just bent inwards. I saw this first on Top Gear, then actually got to try it myself a few weeks later.</p>

              <p>Nobody cares what the inside of their car looks like. Us Americans don’t buy domestic cars caring that we have a plastic dashboard or a car made out of fiberglass or that our interior looks like it was designed by a 6th grader. The goal of a true sports car is perfomance, nothing else really matters.<br>
Why don’t you watch videos of the modern super cars being compared to the Corvette and Viper? Perfomance wise, they are very close but the price tag is usually $50,000+ more for the european super car. I’d rather save the $50,000 and have a crap interior.</p>
