<p>Not impressed by that. Any company can take a car with a severely over-worked set of heads and some form of forced induction to achieve power like that.</p>
<p>I have a few problems with the Ariel Atom, first off they don’t make enough to classify as a real production vehicle and second that thing in no way resembles a car. It’s open wheel wells and has a tube chassis, their is almost no place atleast in America where that thing is street legal.<br>
Ariel Atom<br>
Production	&lt;100 per year</p>
<p>I am not sure what a mass production vehicle is classified by anymore, in the 60’s it used to be 500 of a vehicle had to be made for it to be a production vehicle. Now with the large increase in cars and drivers I imagine a real production car must be way more then that number.</p>
<p>And I couldn’t find a Lotus that actually outhandled the Corvette at 1.06G on the skidpad. And if you really want to get technical I know nothing will beat the ACR at 1.5G.</p>

        <p>The Atom is street legal in the UK and it is now being manufactured in the US because of its popularity (some company bought the rights I think) where it is street legal (in some states, not all). In addition to that there is in fact a couple of years waiting list for it here in the UK, so I’d argue its a production vehicle.

<p>In response to your comments of the Gumpert, I don’t want to call you ignorant (you’re clearly not) but that car is pretty phenomenal in every aspect.

Well I know what I read but the only knowledge I can back up is my hands on experience of motors, the only suspension I know how to set up is that of a car built to go in a strait line. Other then that I just assume what I read is true.</p>
<p>Their is no reason to argue anything (not saying that you are), we can agree to disagree.</p>

<p>Probably all purpose built German and Italian cars too, the corvette is the first car to even get close to European handling, but not close enough.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Then explain why the Dodge Viper ACR still holds the record for the fastest production car on the European Nürburgring?  Which everyone will agree is about as far away from a straight line as you can get.</p>
<p>It’s not debatable that we have the fastest cars in a straight line, but records seem to point to the fact that at least 2 of our vehicles are fastest or near-fastest on road tracks as well.  <span class="bbcode-b">Certainly they are the fastest cars on any type of track for the money.</span><br>
[/quote]<br>
^^Without a doubt in terms of cost.</p>
<p>It was fastest round the Nürburgring for a production car indeed, a Lotus or Atom couldn’t touch it on raw speed I agree. Obviously power outweighs handling in a race. Despite this if you look at actual purpose built racers the European cars dominate the leaderboards. The fact is, we do manage to get more bhp out of smaller engines, but in doing so we increase costs hence why our best cars are at the top of the boards but are too expensive to be mass produced.</p>
<p>America are now in F1 and for me this is going to be the real competition, although when I mentioned this in another thread the Americans seemed uninterested. Kind of stupid really, F1 is at the forefront of racing, and no doubt you’ll have more money to throw at it than us. I mean, even BMW withdrew from F1 this year, so economic crisis has left the sport open to the taking of any team willing to put the effort in.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT: Actually the Gumpert Apollo is a production car and thats over 10 seconds faster than the Dodge. The Radical is actually the fastest but it’s widely debated that its not a production car, and in my opinion it isn’t</span>.</p>

<p>Throwing forced induction on a small engine to get big numbers is not an achievement. The ZR1 is the only car up on the leaderboard that can be driven every day, besides the GTR. The Apollo is just a race car for the streets, and cannot be driven every day like a GTR or ZR1 can.</p>

<p>Probably all purpose built German and Italian cars too, the corvette is the first car to even get close to European handling, but not close enough.</p>

</aside>
<p>Then explain why the Dodge Viper ACR still holds the record for the fastest production car on the European Nürburgring?  Which everyone will agree is about as far away from a straight line as you can get.</p>
<p>It’s not debatable that we have the fastest cars in a straight line, but records seem to point to the fact that at least 2 of our vehicles are fastest or near-fastest on road tracks as well.  <span class="bbcode-b">Certainly they are the fastest cars on any type of track for the money.</span></p>

</aside>
<p>^^Without a doubt in terms of cost.</p>
<p>It was fastest round the Nürburgring for a production car indeed, a Lotus or Atom couldn’t touch it on raw speed I agree. Obviously power outweighs handling in a race. Despite this if you look at actual purpose built racers the European cars dominate the leaderboards. The fact is, we do manage to get more bhp out of smaller engines, but in doing so we increase costs hence why our best cars are at the top of the boards but are too expensive to be mass produced.</p>
<p>America are now in F1 and for me this is going to be the real competition, although when I mentioned this in another thread the Americans seemed uninterested. Kind of stupid really, F1 is at the forefront of racing, and no doubt you’ll have more money to throw at it than us. I mean, even BMW withdrew from F1 this year, so economic crisis has left the sport open to the taking of any team willing to put the effort in.</p>
