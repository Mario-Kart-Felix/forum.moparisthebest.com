Hello and welcome to the [b]official[/b] thread of the newest RSPS project, Diversity!
I&#39;ve been thinking recently, what should I do; I had a really successful community last year called TheModerationZone, which I enjoyed running.
I managed to get over 200,000 registered members, with atleast 250 on at one time. I had enough money then, and I spent it on vBulletin and a domain name. Now, I don&#39;t have much money, as I have a baby boy or girl on the way, so I need all the money I can get at this moment in time. But I&#39;ve decided to start a new project, Diversity, which will hopefully get a few donations and be pretty much a successful server in a whiles time.

At th moment I&#39;m looking for a very kind person to donate me vBulletin or IPB (no-one will do that) or a kind person to donate £3-9 which I can spend on a domain name. I am also looking for a partner, which could hopefully host &amp; code my server. I can code a little bit, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be a better coder than me, so I&#39;d let you do it. That person would be in-charge of the server, but all decisions would have to be run by me before they are made final. I&#39;m also looking for a someone who is an expert in HTML/PHP/etc, which will help out in the forums and give me advice of what to do.

Site-Developer[/b]
You must have experience in the SMF, and when purchased, vBulletin..
You must also have experience in, Javascript, PHP and HTML, you be asked to add some &quot;unique&quot; parts to the website, if you cannot do them, you will have to make up for it some how.

[b]Graphical Producer[/b]
If you apply for this job, you will need to first of all, provide us with a banner that fits the required size. You may then be asked to make forum icons, or a promotional banner to go in the members signatures. Must have Photoshop and have alot of experience. (Prove it)

[b]Server Hoster/Coder[/b]
This would be the most important job, evidently. You will need to be able to host the server atleast 15 hours a day. And you will need to have reasonably good coding skills, although I will code the base if you don&#39;t have a good one.
[b]
IRC Operator[/b]
You will need to be mature, intelligent and helpful on our IRC channel. If you are active everyday, and I notice it alot; I may reward your valuable time with an IRC rank, which after more activity will increase to the highest rank, &#39;Protect&#39; (&amp;)

[b]ALL PICTURES AND INFORMATION ON THE SERVER WILL BE POSTED HERE.

<p>I see nothing that really relates to the development of the server itself. From what I read, It almost seems you are just using this to get some extra cash. You really don’t set any server goals, but you just say you need a team…</p>
<p>Another note, you don’t ‘code’ Java, you program it.</p>

<p>Good luck, I hope your project gets somewhere.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, I already know it’s AOP. I find it easier saying Protect, because most people are like “wtf is aop???”.<br>
Second. I will be the <span class="bbcode-b">only</span> owner on the channel, so that doesn’t need to be said.</p>
<p>Thanks for you support.</p>
