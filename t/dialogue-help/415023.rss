    <description>I&#39;m still figuring out how to add dialogue to an npc, and i&#39;ve been stuck on the same problem for maybe an hour or two. I spawned an npc, made him say &quot;hi how are you&quot; and then when i click next there is an option that says &quot;good&quot; and one that says &quot;terrible&quot;. but i can&#39;t figure out how to create a different response for each option. Can someone help?</description>
