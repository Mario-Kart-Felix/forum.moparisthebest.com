    <title>[317] RuneSky [Official - Since 2009]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-runesky-official-since-2009/524830</link>
    <description>[center][B]To Mopar staff: Please do not remove this thread for being a duplicate. Please delete [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,641952]this thread instead[/url] as it was a different version of RuneSky ran by other people under the same name and is an inaccurate representation of the server &quot;RuneSky&quot;. That server is now offline, this is the official server. If you wish to discuss further, please message me.[/b]

RuneSky has been around ever since mid 2009. To this day, there has been one owner of the official server (even though other versions of the server went online with different owners). This server has always had the vibe of some of the older server that were around (not referring to oldschool runescape remakes), and still has that vibe.
[I]I know some of the community aren&#39;t fans of custom items on servers. Please do not complain about our custom items on this thread.
*- Currently looking for staff (7/12/2013), applications will close in approximately one weeks time. -*[/I]

Quick Features (not in the picture above):
- Donators get bonus XP
- Donator status is instantly applied to your account
- Skillcapes: 99 = Untrimmed, 110 = Trimmed, 126 = Master Capes.
- Server recently re-opened, completely fresh start with accounts.
- Full PK armour (e.g Statius) which can be obtained from our Sea Troll Queen boss.
- All special attacks work.
[b][i]
Notes:
- We have active players. We are currently a small community, but we are looking to expand. 
- The &quot;players online&quot; showed in the image of our quests is an inaccurate representation of our player-base. This picture was taken whilst online our test server.
