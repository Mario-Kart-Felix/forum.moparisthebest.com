    <title>I need help with Grand Exchange Selling</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-grand-exchange-selling/477800</link>
    <description>Hey i&#39;m currently using a 667 source. I have most of the G.E working at the moment. It can buy where you pay and it spawns the item in your inventory, but when you click on sell it opens up with your inventory items go to the left and then aren&#39;t clickable. If someone could help me fix this i would greatly appreciate it!

Here is an image of what happens when you click sell: [img]http://https//www.dropbox.com/s/0eazwvoxhlaxuuc/g.e.png[/img]

If image isn&#39;t working go to: https://www.dropbox.com/s/0eazwvoxhlaxuuc/g.e.png

My source base is: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=555776.0

I&#39;ve tried to edit it and i even had my friend who is good at coding try and he can&#39;t seem to get it. :S</description>
