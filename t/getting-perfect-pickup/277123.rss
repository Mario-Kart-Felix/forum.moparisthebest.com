    <title>Getting perfect pickup</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-perfect-pickup/277123</link>
    <description>Okay I want it so players dont have to click on an item 1000 times to pick it up. I want it strictly so it picks up the item in 1 click with no dupe problems. If anyone could help me that would be great I&#39;ve been searching for a tutorial for about 2 months now and every time I&#39;ve asked for help to find one or anything no one will ever help me accept complain that I need to learn java. If you&#39;re gonna complain you need to go learn some java because complaining that I posted this just means you dont know what to do.</description>
