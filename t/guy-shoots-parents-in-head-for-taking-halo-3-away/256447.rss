He said he expected a pleasant surprise. Then his head went numb from the gunshot.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>Well, i think you are mis-understanding the definition of addiction</p>
<blockquote>The term "addiction" is used in many contexts to describe an obsession, compulsion, or excessive physical dependence or psychological dependence</blockquote>
<p>the addiction we are talking about is psycological dependance, meaning that if the persons body comes to rely on this high, and if they do not get the high, then this will lead to psychological withdrawal symptoms (such as cravings, irritability, insomnia, depression, anorexia, etc).</p>

</aside>
<p>I can relate it in context to excersize,<br>
Excersizing powerfully stimulates the adrenal glands causing a high. It also stimulates respiration and circulation, causing euphoric feelings related to these. It also produces lactic acid which can have a euphoric effect. It is this euphoric effect that i think sanga282 is talking about, i suppose it is the same as taking an extasy tablet, you get a high, like it and do it again. Addiction.</p>

<p>So you also think that McDonald’s is to blame when someone is obese? Globally seen it’s the same. Of course the parents have a little more control in the live of the kid then McDonald’s has over their customers.</p>
<p>And to the key part: How old is this kid? If your father/mother has a serious disease, which involves medication that is very bad for someone that doesn’t have this disease. They put the medicines in a closet, and lock it. You know where the key is. Are your parents to blame when <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> take this medicine and die?</p>

youve never heard of a gambling addiction? a sex addiction?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Nope. I’ve heard of habits, though. ;)[/quote]<br>
lies, as i said before, these activites can release endorphins in the brain which make you crave that activity because you get addicted to the endorphins!</p>
