              <p>Oh man you are only like … about  four to five months too late. They had astro a40’s on sale for like $50 at the microsoft stores. Companies that have price matches with Microsoft was like " don’t do this don’t do this! "</p>
<p>Sadly though normally the a50’s cost you about $300 ( which I have, and are amazing to say the least )</p>
<p>I think the krakens are probably your best bet if you can find a pair in your price range. There are also some that have the skulls on the site that are white? You seem them in a lot of gaming youtube videos but I can’t remember the name of them at the moment I vaguely recall somebody telling me they are normally around $85.</p>

              <p>I personally use Razer Krakens. The pair I got have a mic in it. There’s a cheaper pair that doesn’t have them, but it’s like a $20 difference.<br>
They have 5.1 surround sound in them.<br>

<a href="http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-kraken-pro" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-kraken-pro</a> I have these but green. They were $99 when I bought them like a year or so ago.<br>
