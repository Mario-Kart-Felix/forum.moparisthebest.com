    <title>718+ Drop party room</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-drop-party-room/519473</link>
    <description>So im using rune-evo 742 and as most everyone knows you cant drop anything Because of obvious dupeing reasons, however i want to have a drop party once my server hits soo many people but instead of getting rid of the Destroy item and haveing them disapear instantly i want to add the drop party room. I have tested it to see if it works but when u hit the lever it gives u options but nothing works, all i want is the balloon drop so i can do this drop party, anyone know a good way to make this work? thanks  ;D</description>
