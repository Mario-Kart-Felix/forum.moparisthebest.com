    <description>[b][u]What is Mayhem&#39;s Client?[/u][/b]

[i][u]Mayhem&#39;s Client[/u][/i] is going to be a [b]script dependent user developer client[/b] that will give users/developers a quick and easy scripting system for creating custom content and commands for their clients behavior and performance, it will have user friendly interface that may be scripted and executed while in their client at any time. Cache Related content packing is planned on being created so that players may be able to develop their content, while the client is still [b][i]running[/i][/b]. Please do [b]REMEMBER[/b] that this is only the beginning of the project, client concept and designs. [b][u]Most of the content planned has not even been started[/u][/b].

You can view the media below, please do not that I have only one video because I haven&#39;t started anything but the client commands system, which isn&#39;t even script-able yet.

I had two other screenshot&#39;s but I had lost them. My current server has bad player updating and isn&#39;t rendering players. Do not that the video is old media.

I do know that just one piece of content is the best start of the project, but with this one piece, I hope I can get enough support and help with creating this design when needed, so that I may continue my work onto this design. I will not remove this topic unless forced by Moparian staff.</description>

<p>Haha I would expect people to disallow the name “Client” as Jagex probably had, lol.</p>
<p>but anyways the message that came from the client was just a test that was sent from the client, it had nothing to do with server sided additions. At the time, I wasn’t able to use the command packet for this because of an issue that I had with the server.</p>

              <p>I don’t type slow, it’s the video compressor and the frame rate. Hypercam 2 also sucks very bad. Anyways, I cannot continue this because I recently installed Ubuntu 12.10 and without knowing, I selected to write the OS over windows xp and I lost everything. I had no back ups either. :s</p>
<p>Anyways, I have downloaded Galkons Refactored and am going to restart all over, though the original version had used srcPackaged instead of an unpackaged client. I will soon rewrite the Command_UI though, and will probably not continue it from there until I actually find a suitable scripting system to implement.</p>
<p>Sorry to disappoint everyone. I will try to have a moderator lock and/or remove this thread.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/flame">@Flame</a>, If I decide to redo this, I will keep everything updated, and describe a bit more. Though I’ll say I was aiming  for a developers client, that could possibly create a new clientscript that handles more than interfaces, but scriptable interface for test’s an emulation for the most part. In the newer one that I MIGHT create, I think I may redo the report_abuse system. The project’s results should make interfaces more user friendly and give developers more creativity, due to what will come of course.</p>

              <p>This would be more appealing if I was able to draw up a general idea of what this is going to become.<br>
Are you basically using the idea of a developer’s console and implementing that into a 317?<br>
Are you going to hash, and are you still going to leave the functionality of the double semicolon?<br>
Can you show an example of what methods will be used in order to create new commands and/or content?<br>
Otherwise, good luck.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
