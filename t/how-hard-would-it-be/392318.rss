              <p>I think it’s hyperbole though. They can’t use this to wipe a book from existence. We don’t live in the 1940s any more, society has changed in such a way that you can’t just wipe information from existence. (Well, it wasn’t particularly successful in the 1940s either, since we are talking about it, but it’s even harder now.)</p>
<p>Also, the fact that they CAN do such a thing is no reason for us to assume that they would. If you start going down that road, none of us should be using the internet at all, since it COULD be used to filter and wipe information as we all well know. We shouldn’t be using computers, in case operating system manufacturers have backdoors in place to do similar things (open source is not immune, as the OpenBSD IPSEC stack infiltration by the FBI showed).</p>
<p>Calling this a “remote delete” is disingenuous. As far as I’m aware, Amazon cannot remote delete anything I placed there. They can remove things from my account, which, if they are on my Kindle, will also remove them from my Kindle. But that’s only things I purchased from the Amazon store. Am I mistaken about this?</p>

<p>1984 is available on the Kindle from reputable publishers which they can’t remote delete, also if you get a copy yourself (that you either bought elsewhere, or you live in a country where it is no longer under copyright) they can’t remote delete that either.</p>

<p>Tyrants and autocrats have always understood that education and books are dangerous to them. They can put independent and even rebellious ideas in the heads of their subjects.</p>
<p>In the past, authorities wanting to remove books from society would have to physically force their way into everybody’s homes, examine all their shelves and make a massive bonfire to burn all the contraband.</p>
<p>With e–book readers and an ethereal wireless internet that task is made so much easier. A clerk sits in an office and pushes a button. It results in thousands of copies of books being deleted remotely from all Kindles worldwide.</p>
<p>So could someone actually answer my question, if Linux is installed on a Kindle, does it stop authorities deleting my books remotely?</p>

Read the article:<br>
“Justin Gawronski, a 17-year-old from the Detroit area, was reading “1984” on his Kindle for a summer assignment and lost all his notes and annotations when the file vanished. “They didn’t just take a book back, they stole my work,” he said.”</p>

<p>It’s not particularly open though, they basically meet minimum obligations and go no further.</p>
<p>And yeah there’s no problem with running custom software on it, there’s just nobody making anything solid. There’s a pretty good chinese one that adds some cool features, but the english translation is pretty spotty. It dual boots alongside official though so I keep meaning to try it out and forgetting.</p>
