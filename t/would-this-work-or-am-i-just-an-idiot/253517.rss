    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-this-work-or-am-i-just-an-idiot/253517</link>
    <description>If staying up all night starving yourself a couple times a week, would that be effective in loosing weight? i&#39;m not fat or anything its just that i could be lighter.

btw, does anybody know any good malware scanners that scan you&#39;re entire computer?</description>

<p>Humans have evolved over time. Back in the day humans would go for periods of time without eating large quantities of food. The body adapted.</p>
<p>In short, if you starve yourself then your body begins to break protein down - it will actually do all that it can to avoid breaking fat stores down.<br>
This is the trap that most people fall into, which induces the yo-yo effect: they don’t care about what they’re losing to cause the loss of weight, as long as they’re losing the weight.<br>
Most people undereat and lose their protein (which muscles are built from), which means their metabolism slows (due to the reduction in muscle size and density) - when the diet ends they eat again, only this time they’re burning fat at an even slower rate, which in turn means they put the weight back on and then a little.</p>
<p>The real solution is actually quite simple: a lifestyle change, meal-wise.<br>
Ideally people should eat around 6 small meals per day, at 2 - 3 hour intervals. They should eat grainy foods in the morning, such as breads (grainy breads, not white bread), cereal, etc. At the end of the day they should be eating lean meat, such as ham, along with foods that have complex carb chains (foods such as lettuce and brocolli are great).<br>
To optimise results you should drink double the daily recommended intake of water. This keeps your system clean, and also stops your body from storing water, which reduces water weight.</p>

for a day it wont make any difference as your body can sustain itself off what you normaly eat for a day and then just not waste as much crap when you go for shit. But over four days you wont be able to eat as much as you normaly could, your stomach will have shrunk. You will feel full but still need sustenance and you will be weak and tired out. Then when your stomach grows again you will start eating more and more until your body has balanced out the previous inequality</p>

Not eating actually makes you gain weight over time<br>
[/quote]<br>
I’m not a expert and I’m not trying to act like one. But how? After a while of ‘starving’ yourself your body begins to ‘eat’ your organs and muscle tissues (muscle tissues first). Making you lose even more weight. If it made you gain wait over time, then why are anorexic people so skinny and weigh so less? The only thing I can think of that your saying is starving yourself for a while, then eating twice as much, making up for the lost time and even eating a bit more.[/quote]Made a mistake… if you starve yourself, and try to eat the same or a little bit less then as you used to your bodies metabolism would have slowed down already so it would be harder to lose that weight again.</p>
