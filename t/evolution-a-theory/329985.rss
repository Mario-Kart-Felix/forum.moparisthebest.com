    <title>Evolution a theory?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/evolution-a-theory/329985</link>
    <description>well a lot of  Christians believe that evolution is a theory made up by scientists, well so is gravity (theory), now go jump off a cliff.

i had enough with people still accepting the fact that we came from adam and eve, one women laughed at me when i said i believe in evolution, she said then why are still monkeys around, shouldn&#39;t all of them be humans.

i am sure if she was properly educated on this subject she wouldn&#39;t of said that.

i have nothing against any religion but (i refuse to believe Jesus is the son of god) i believe in god.

so what do you think?

(wana flame go ahead :P)</description>

<p>Sure you can believe in god when you think about why you are living for and what happens when you die your brain manifests god. Then you can look at dumber less evolved animals like chickens when their throat is getting slit and head ripped off some of them don’t even care.</p>
<p>There maybe even more information that we don’t even know the question and answer too because our brain doesn’t even understand what the hell it’s looking at. Take big foot for example you may think he doesn’t exist but yet there is word on him could he be made up? what about all the stories of people who encounter him not remembering anything… obviously he has the power to control peoples thoughts and hypnotize people.</p>
<p>Now take a very small animal a goldfish has unique abilities to see both infra-red and ultra-violent rays it like size doesn’t matter you say you can’t teach a goldfish tricks? I’ve seen goldfish catch objects and return them to their owners like a dog.</p>
<p>Anyways my theory is that<br>
intelligence was given to us very primitively by god as our souls programmed in their bodies and learned a few tricks/functions etc they compressed it all in their sperm where they pass it off to their offsprings which takes 18 years to decompress then give em a few years to use the knowledge then improve on it etc… and pass it on again…</p>
<p>As it’s already proven that selective breeding in super cows is a FACT not theory they got cows born stronger then most human body builders by breeding strongest cows then their offspring again to make even stronger cow.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nmkj5gq1cQU%5B/quote%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nmkj5gq1cQU[/quote]</a><br>
video is hilarious when they collect the cows sperm</p>

<p>i couldn’t stop laughing about big foot,</p>
<p>who said there isn’t a great power that exists above us and it does not have a form. the great power hath layed out the language of our world and how it works. for we are uncovering and decoding its language , physics and mathematics.</p>
<p>if you believe in evolution that doesn’t mean something greater (in most ppls word god) exist or cease to.</p>

              <p>Natural selection is one aspect of evolution. I don’t see evolution as a debatable concept; the universe is constantly changing and evolving, whether you couch this in religious imagery or scientific data. Natural selection is one aspect of evolution, but it’s not always a factor. I don’t think that science has a perfect model of evolution and certainly you can take the idea of natural selection too far (Social Darwinism).</p>
<p>Some religious fanatics seem to think that the highly symbolic accounts of creation presented in their religious texts are intended to elucidate the actual creation of our world. Though some ancient teachings (Taoism, Vedantic Philosophy, etc…) seem to be somewhat in line with current scientific theories those of the Abrahamic faiths are lacking in this regard. Though further analysis of the numerical encoding of the Hebrew bible might reveal many intricate threads of mathematical symbolism embedded within the text this is really only further confirmation of the very subjective nature of religion.</p>
<blockquote>:) Well if you know that's what I was getting at, then why not explain to me why this universe exists. What caused the big bang, and where did the particles that existed before the universe come from?</blockquote>
<p>The big bang is not a wholly accepted theory. There are some <a href="http://www.spaceandmotion.com/Cosmology-Big-Bang-Theory.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">questions</a> about it.</p>
<p>Why does the universe exist? There is no reason why it shouldn’t exist. Though some solipsistic people believe the universe only exists because they are aware it exists, only the most narcissistic and self-centered people believe that the universe exists because it is “Gods Plan” etc… etc. A rational thought process should lead you to the conclusion that belief in a singular causation for the entire universe or disbelief in such a causation really comes down to a matter of intellectualized semantics and is far removed from an authentic religious experience. Aldous Huxley said in his utopian novel <span class="bbcode-i">Island</span> “Give us this day our daily Faith, but deliver us, dear God, from Belief.” Science and religion shouldn’t really be in  competition, religion should encourage us to seek out the truth and use it for good, while science is an excellent method for discovering what the truth actually is.</p>
