    <title>Reflection on non applet clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reflection-on-non-applet-clients/538857</link>
    <description>Hey this seems  like an active forum for java hacks and bots though specifically directed at runescape. My question is how would one go about hacking a java client and building a reflection client for it. The game is puzzle pirates and the client is a downloadable jar. how would i go about hacking it and building my own reflection client for the game?</description>
