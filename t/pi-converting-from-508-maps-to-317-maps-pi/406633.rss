    <title>[PI] Converting from 508 maps to 317 maps [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-converting-from-508-maps-to-317-maps-pi/406633</link>
    <description>Hey guys i downloaded a server with 508 maps, and i dont like them &gt;&lt; Half the building are missing, Godwars doesnt work correctly, etc, I was wondering if any one knows how to convert back to 317? Iv been trying for days now and cant seem to make them work :\ Right now i have 317 maps and 508 maps in my cache so it loads the building that arnt there but when i put all 317 maps in, nothng works :\

I will give a reward if neccessary, we can nagotiate on msn or however we can communicate, I know that we arnt allowed to post thing with rewards attached to em but I think if this is a big task then you should get something? 

Anyways you can contact me through email or msn I do have skype if neccessary PM me on here if you can before adding me :)
