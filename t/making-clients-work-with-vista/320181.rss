    <title>Making Clients work with Vista</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-clients-work-with-vista/320181</link>
    <description>Difficulty: 2/10

I had been working on trying to figure it out, and someone had told me about a Batch Converter, this is a video that I made that will tell you how to go threw and make the .bat into a .exe which will allow people with Vista to be able to play your server.

I tested it and it worked.

Download: 

Batch Converter: http://www.battoexe.com/

PNG, JPEG, GIF, and BMP - ICO converter: http://www.icoconverter.com/


YouTube Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dmi13tf6dY


If you don&#39;t want to watch the video just read then.

Step 1:

Download the Batch Converter

http://www.battoexe.com/

Step 2:

Go to your Run.bat for your client

Right click edit
Copy everything in there

Step 3

Open your Batch Converter and paste it while it is in the tab &quot;Source&quot;

(If you want a custom Icon)

Go to http://www.icoconverter.com/

With your picture and convert it to .ico

Go to Tab &quot;Embedded Files&quot; and do Browse

Then find your picture you made into .ico and click Open

Once you&#39;ve done that just click &quot;Build&quot;
and Name it whatever you want to call it.

Once you named it and saved it, it should save in your &quot;My Documents&quot; unless you moved it somewhere else, just take what you made and put it with all your client files double click it, and you&#39;ll see this

Just click Space-Bar or something and it should start loading your client like normal. 

Congrats, you are done.</description>
