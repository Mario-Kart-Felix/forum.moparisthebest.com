    <title>How would i make a New rank?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-make-a-new-rank/417709</link>
    <description>Okay, well i really want to make a new rank, but i&#39;m not sure how. xD this is how i want it too be like; 


This would be a great way to see if the mod you picked will do his\her job well. If you think they did their job well in lets say a week. You can promote her to the next position &quot;Mod&quot;

Mod position would have the silver crown(obv.) and have the commands as such
1. mute
2. ban
3. tele to player
4.tele player to me
5. ip mute(optional)
After they promoted to this and they do really good(any time span) they could be promoted to the highest position &quot;Head Mod&quot;

So basically, i want a &#39;Trail Mod&#39; Rank, which would have a blue crown off such. If anyone could help, i&#39;d Apriciate it. (spelling) Dunt hate.</description>
