    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lostpkz-is-back/519110</link>
    <description>[B][SIZE=5]Welcome to Lost-Pkz a RuneScape private server. We plan to be as different from other servers as much as possible. You may know Lost-Pkz from years ago, well it died. We plan to bring it back and have all the Lost-Pkz fans and members to begin playing again and have good old times. We will be dedicated like the old Lost-Pkz and have regular updates.. We decided to shake things up a bit with a new name and such! Let&#39;s get this going again![/SIZE][/B]

[SIZE=4][B]We will have many quests and unique features so it dosen&#39;t get old and boring like every server you see these days! We are putting a server up now for you to play while we update.

We plan on giving Lost-Pkz an old school feeling/look with newschool in it so not like a remake nor is it a 562 wannabe, just 474 looking and great economy!
