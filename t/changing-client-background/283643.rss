    <title>Changing client background</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-client-background/283643</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I am having some trouble changing my clients background... I did all the things it said in a tut, ill tell what i did briefly. 

&gt; I Made my own background, corresponding to the size of the original background. 
&gt; I saved the new background to m client files in the same place the old one was.
&gt; Then i deleted the old picture and renamed my new one the same as the old one... 

If any one knows what i am doing wrong would they please share it with me ^.^

Thanks

              <p>Your not doing anything wrong, it should be working, But i think i know why it’s not working, it’s probably a different file type.<br>
It might of been a .GIF but you saved it at OLDNAME.jpg or png etc.</p>
