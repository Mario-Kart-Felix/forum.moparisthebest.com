    <description>The plans for a no fly zone over Libya Britain and France have been trying to push over the past week or two have finally got *firm* backing from the US and the UN.

Didn&#39;t expect to see a result this early..

<p>Gaddafi says he will arm Libyan civilians to defend against crusaders.[/quote]</p>
<p>the article is 100% propoganda by gaddafi to gain support and try to unify a nation against a common enemy hence why most people share the view that no ground troops should land in libya, the no fly zone (should) be strictly against gaddafi’s airforce and troops, not the common citizens, ‘rebels’ or anyone else</p>
<p>[quote=“Frell, post:43, topic:386773”]But theyre not really resisting anything, theyre pushing :\</p>
<p>But I get it yea[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote=“Frell, post:45, topic:386773”]That they provoked though</p>
<p>Im not against the event just the terminology lol[/quote]</p>
<p>peaceful protests do not justify military intervention edit: hence saying they provoked it is just wrong</p>

<p>I would have also had that notion if it wasn’t for two things. Firstly, people have got to be pretty damn stupid to be in favour of Ghadafi. Secondly, I have a few Libyan friends who all share the same beliefs regarding Ghadafi.</p>
<p>I find France’s devotion in support of the resistance suspicious. What do those Muslim-hating Frenchies want?</p>

Too late. If this happened earlier, the resistance may have had a chance.<br>
[/quote]The resistance ahahahaha.</p>
<p>Yo, dude, people are so fucking stupid, forealz.  No fly zone just means that we’re going to be bombing to shit out of their people.  Ah, this fucking world dude.  Then we’re going to instill a new dictator, and if he doesn’t play ball, we just Saddam the shit out of them.[/quote]<br>
I am hopeful that the fact that there won’t be any foreign troops on the ground and that the resistance started before foreign intervention, means that it is unlikely a dictator will be instilled. I am only hopeful and things could change very quickly.</p>

Oh god no its not just this, its everything else also. Obama took too long to make a decision and it cost peoples lives so another country had to stand up and do something.</p>
