    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-portforwarding-server-with-linksys/408766</link>
    <description>Ok well the title says it all. I just got a Linksys router thing and i can&#39;t get it to portforward. I went to my address thing and went to game and applications and i got all that right with the 43594 port things. i have a port checker and it says my port is open. i got a ip thing and i can&#39;t figure out why i can&#39;t log onto my server with the ip address the only way i can get on is if i do 0.0.0.0, so any one got and ideas what wrong.??  :confused: :confused:</description>
