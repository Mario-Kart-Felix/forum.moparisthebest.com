    <title>Call of Duty: World at War - Map Pack 3</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/call-of-duty-world-at-war-map-pack-3/295545</link>
    <description>I wasn&#39;t actually going to buy this, but a few of the people that I play with managed to convince me to get it, so I ended up doing so, and then convincing Rich to get it. :P  To start, I&#39;ll say that I definitely bought this map pack not for the online multiplayer maps, but for the zombie map (Der Riese).  

The multiplayer maps are good, the only one I have a particular disliking to is Breach; the other two - Battery and Revolution - have rather good ideas and have interesting themes to them.  

Der Riese is a zombie factory, in this map you now have the ability to teleport, and even upgrade your weapons.  The great thing about the map packs is that you get everything in the previous map pack, plus more.  After the levels get higher, upgrading your gun (which costs 5000 points) is almost mandatory if you wish to stay alive.  The map pack also introduces a new special grenade; the monkey bomb, which attracts attention of the zombies and they all run around it (a lot like the flashy-type-thingy from Left 4 Dead) and then it finally explodes.  Another new addition is the Bowie Knife; an extremely powerful knife that has the ability to 1-hit at round 15.  The regular knife takes 2-hits to kill at round 2.  

As a final conclusion, this zombie map is absolutely exhilarating, the fun you have on this zombie map is ridiculous, and the level of intensity is insane.  I encourage anyone who has the game to go buy this map pack.  Below, I have pasted how far I&#39;ve gotten, and if anyone wants any tips, just ask.

Ah, it wasn’t you I was playing with, but we did exactly the same. Did you camp up right at the back of the map on the stair case and the cage for the dogs?</p>

<p>Yeah, we just finished our best score so far, (Round 29) and it took us 3 hours; well worth the time spent (but mind you, we had crawlers and we were running around playing with the box/upgrading and such).</p>

              <p>I wasn’t actually going to buy this, but a few of the people that I play with managed to convince me to get it, so I ended up doing so, and then convincing Rich to get it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  To start, I’ll say that I definitely bought this map pack not for the online multiplayer maps, but for the zombie map (Der Riese).</p>
<p>The multiplayer maps are good, the only one I have a particular disliking to is Breach; the other two - Battery and Revolution - have rather good ideas and have interesting themes to them.</p>
<p>Der Riese is a zombie factory, in this map you now have the ability to teleport, and even upgrade your weapons.  The great thing about the map packs is that you get everything in the previous map pack, plus more.  After the levels get higher, upgrading your gun (which costs 5000 points) is almost mandatory if you wish to stay alive.  The map pack also introduces a new special grenade; the monkey bomb, which attracts attention of the zombies and they all run around it (a lot like the flashy-type-thingy from Left 4 Dead) and then it finally explodes.  Another new addition is the Bowie Knife; an extremely powerful knife that has the ability to 1-hit at round 15.  The regular knife takes 2-hits to kill at round 2.</p>
<p>As a final conclusion, this zombie map is absolutely exhilarating, the fun you have on this zombie map is ridiculous, and the level of intensity is insane.  I encourage anyone who has the game to go buy this map pack.  Below, I have pasted how far I’ve gotten, and if anyone wants any tips, just ask.</p>

Round 22 - 4 Players<br>
