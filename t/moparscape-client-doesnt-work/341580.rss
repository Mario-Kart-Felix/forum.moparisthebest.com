    <title>Moparscape client doesn&#39;t work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-client-doesnt-work/341580</link>
    <description>So just a couple of days ago it seems that the MoparScape 3.2 Downloadable client stopped working. It was the only way i could connect to 317 servers (including my own) on my mac, and now when i try to run it, it just opens and then quits. This is not my computer, I have tested it on multiple computers and the same thing happend everytime. Before it was working perfectly. Is anyone having the same problems, or can you give me any ideas to solve the problem?

THanks, Dark</description>

              <p>As I said guys it was working fine with my server. The client doesn’t load as in it doesn’t even get to the username and password screen. Thanks for trying though</p>

              <p>If you want the moparscape client to work with your server, you have to make sure all interfaces, frames, npc’s, items work with it or you will have some issues.</p>
