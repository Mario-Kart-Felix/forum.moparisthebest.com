    <description>OK, this is probably both a server and client question maybe 

What I am trying to do is make a 508 server load only on my local machine and not have to use   my IP other than 127.0.0..... 
so I can run it while I work on spawn points for monsters and xp rates, drops , npcs learning everything to do with it  since I’m new to the server side software. Basically it will be a strictly pve server, hopefully able to make gates and dungeon entrances working etc etc. 
I’m trying to use the Palidino76 server. 

My first problem is figuring out why even if I port forward the port specified in the run cmd  it still remains at the process of &quot;starting  server on port 43540&quot; or whatever the port is, it doesn’t do anything past that. I’ve went through several tutorials and did exactly as   they  instructed ,, still the same result.

My next problem is trying to find where to configure the IP into the server so that it doesn’t need me to open a port to run. I’ve been through all of the cmd files in the folder; none of them seem to have it. 

I don’t think the client will be an issue as long as I use an IP changing client but if there are any client issues I have no clue about I suppose Ill have to ask another question huh? Right now I’m just trying to see progress from the current situation.</description>
