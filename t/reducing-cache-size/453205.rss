    <title>Reducing cache size</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reducing-cache-size/453205</link>
    <description>When it comes to maintaining a small cache size, I understand there are only a few ways in doing so, however most of the cases that involve extremely large cache sizes are ones which include non cache packed material, such as hard coded sprites. In my case, my main_file_cache.dat is about 100MB. How would I go about making it smaller, or at least compressing it somehow, which really won&#39;t big too much of a difference.</description>
