    <title>Anyone good with webclients, as co-owner</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-good-with-webclients-as-co-owner/427771</link>
    <description>Okay so basically, i dont have the time or the head space for makeing a webclient right now... and i really do need a co-owner who has some knowledge of coding to give me a hand getting this thing up and running... 

I have alot of time free, and i know java is good practice for programming...So i will be working on this server for around 8 months, what happens after that who knows.. i will probably hand it all over to the co. 

Anyways, even if you dont want anything to do with the server but know some of webclients, and wouldnt mind giving me a quick hand it would be much appreciated, thanks. (Just so you know, i do know how to make a webclient, im just encountering some difficulties, and icould do with a referaL (: thanks, scott.</description>
