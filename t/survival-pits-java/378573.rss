    <title>Survival Pits (Java)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/survival-pits-java/378573</link>
    <description>Hello.

I have recently been wanting to learn more about Java, so I am attempting to create a Java variation of Boxhead Rooms (named Survival Pits).

There is no current proof of development, as I have just started recently..

If anyone would like to assist me through the creation of this game, contact me by:
MSN: Justin.persinger@gmail.com

Note: I will post more about this as the game is father into development.</description>

Yeah, it’s all sprites.</p>
<p>I’m having trouble with overlapping sprites with a slight offset… Such as, the guns.<br>
If you’ve played it you know what I mean.<br>
Can anyone explain to me how this could be done?</p>
