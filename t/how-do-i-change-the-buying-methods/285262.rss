    <title>How do I change the buying methods?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-change-the-buying-methods/285262</link>
    <description>I think thats the problem with ChassyScape. (The glitch where you can only buy 1 thing at a time from a shop, even if you click on &#39;Buy 5, 10, or X&#39;) The buying methods are probably screwed, does anyone know how to change them or where to change them?
Thanks.</description>
