    <title>Server Development: Where Should I Start?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-development-where-should-i-start/529077</link>
    <description>Im looking to start RSPS development as in making custom items, coding custom ranks and such. Where should I start developing? Are there any beginners guides to RSPS development? 

Thanks SO much! :D</description>

              <p>always a place to learn. I suggest downloading an ide (i use eclipse and sk8r posted above about it.)</p>
<p>this will help greatly with programming.</p>
<p>second download the base and client, and follow a basic guide to get it working to where you can log in.<br>
once you’re assured it works, and isn’t throwing any errors/crashing upon start up, then you should read basic java docs on data types and whatnot, then just open up some of the files, and just read them. don’t try to jump into modifications. just read over, see how things are written. if you cannot understand what it is saying or doing, refer back to the documentation.</p>

              <p>well you’re going to need a few things to be ‘successful’</p>
<p>• unique ideas for content<br>
• knowledge to add content<br>
• money or ability to advertise said features<br>
• money for stability of hosting/protection from skids<br>
• patience because not everything kicks off<br>
• desire to thrive<br>
• willingness to learn</p>
<p>seeing as you’re new to the scene, you probably won’t be successful just yet.<br>
I suggest trying to dive into the programming language a bit before you try to accomplish the task of a server, however you’re free to do whatever you please.</p>
<p>if you wish to go with starting off as fast as possible, your best bet (in turns of most available tutorials) would be to go with (in descending order) delta, project insanity, shard.<br>
shard being the most stable, but still not efficient base.<br>
project insanity being the most used, but horribad.<br>
delta being the “legend” around here, not all that bad, but poor practices and inefficient teachings.</p>
<p>if you want to learn efficient code/actually learn the language for what it is and use a highly respectable base, and give you the actual reason to learn (for you will need help a lot) use one of these bases: (in descending order of stability) scape-emulator, Apollo, rune-source, Hyperion.</p>
<p>scape-emulator being the newest, most efficient; lacks tutorials but great to learn from.<br>
Apollo being highly scalable and efficient. great to work with, very stable. decent amount of tutorials.<br>
rune-source, had some kinks in the code in the beginning. pretty good to work with now. efficient in terms of being single threaded. easy to work with. good amount of tutorials.<br>
hyperion, been out longest of the four, however it is only starting to be seen more now than before. great amount of tutorials, good base to work with. stable and efficient.</p>
