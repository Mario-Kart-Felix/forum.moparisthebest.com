    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-hosting-server-and-getting-people-to-connect-to-it/285897</link>
    <description>I have done my RSPS but cant get anyone to connect to it this is what ive done so far

1. i clicked the runserver.bat file and ran the server locally on my computer
2. found the ip address of my computer
3. went onto moparscape webclient and typed in user and pass.
4. in the server ip box i entered the ip address of my computer.
and it didnt work just said &quot;error connecting to server must be down&quot;

BTW i want to run my server from my computer to start with ill get a vps later.

any help would be greatly appreciated howeveryou did to host it if you own a RSPS (RS private server) can u write about the steps you took to host it and how you got other people to connect to it.

Thanks in advance.</description>

              <p>First of all do all the portforwarding that is needed =&gt; Firewalls/router etc.<br>
Then use no-ip to update your dynamic ip So you’ll be able to connect with that host too.</p>
<p>When you try to connect from your own computer, you can have difficulties (depending on your router) connecting just using your ip adress.</p>
<p>Either try ‘localhost’ or ‘127.0.0.1’ as ip to connect to your own server</p>
