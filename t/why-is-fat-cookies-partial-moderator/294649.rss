    <title>Why is Fat Cookies partial moderator?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-is-fat-cookies-partial-moderator/294649</link>
    <description>First off, I&#39;m posting this here because I don&#39;t want to PM anyone here or on the IRC, and this is the closest I can get to a public post for &#39;only&#39; mods to see.

I don&#39;t have anything against Fat Cookies, but I don&#39;t see why he was chosen to moderate the client hacking boards. For all I know, he could&#39;ve been reporting dozens of posts from the section, but as you can see, I&#39;m unable to... see... that. I haven&#39;t seen him that active lately, nor post something helpful community. He just seems like a regular senior member, and you might as well just pick someone else who&#39;s been here since 2007-2008.

Anyways, fill me in.
