    <title>Looking to make a server with someone</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-make-a-server-with-someone/452509</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i am looking for someone that has experience in this subject. Someone that can teach me how to do code. You do not have to spill out every piece of knowledge you have to me but teach me the basics. I want to make a server and actually code  it and get it running and get some people on it. If you want to be serious and actually make this a fully grown working and ready to go server by all means. But if you just want to do this for the heck of coding and see what we can make out of it then be my guest. Shoot me a pm or simply comment here. I AM A QUICK LEARNER AND CAN CATCH ONTO THINGS QUICKLY. Thanks guys.  :D</description>

<p>Then put it in the right section.  I like how you won’t even accept his advice, he’s telling you strait out that it’s more than likely going to get locked so I don’t see what’s so bad about warning you that you should move it.  And literary almost every project is to learn more about programming, even if it’s not Java specifically.</p>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with doing that. I was just pointing out that you’ve posted this in the wrong section. Also, you should make an attempt to learn the BASICS yourself.</p>
