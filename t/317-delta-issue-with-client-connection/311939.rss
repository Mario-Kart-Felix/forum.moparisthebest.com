    <title>[317][Delta]Issue with client connection</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-issue-with-client-connection/311939</link>
    <description>Hey,

My client works perfectly, and I can connect to my server via the no-IP url from the network that my server&#39;s on, but when someone outside my network tries to connect, they get an error connecting to server message.

Here&#39;s my client.java if you&#39;d like to look at it: http://pastebin.com/m1162a7fb

EDIT: Yes, I am 100% sure my ports are forwarded correctly and my no-IP is set up right. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking this question, rather than following one of the numerous helpful tutorials on how to configure no-IP and/or portforwarding. 

Thanks,

iDavid</description>
