    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/snickerscape-maybe-its-in-beta/549285</link>
    <description>i decided to kickstart my server after a 7 year hiatus (because so many people were asking for it i know guys) (thats sarcasm)

anyway its nothing special i literally just got a source and im going to start making it my own kind of the original source is Pkplanet
Link to the source: https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,419547.0.html (as of right now all credits to them because im a lazy arse) 

(source is liable to change down the road if i cant do anything with the existing one but i highly doubt that will happen especially if players really start to get on here which i also doubt)
