    <title>Writing a server from scratch, need to know some things</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/writing-a-server-from-scratch-need-to-know-some-things/137084</link>
    <description>Oman, I need to know two things so I can start working on BeanServ. First of all, I need the login procedure, and second of all, how does one fill in and flush out an RSStream (stream.java).

TY, io9`</description>

<p>That is with disabled RSA and ISAAC. But liek, I also took out a lot of stupid stuff like the long representing the username and the eight '0’s that are exchanged. There are a few other things I took out, but that code up there will bring you up to the login screen.[/quote]<br>
Heh, I just copy+pasted my login procedure from client.run() :P. but I need to know what happens after. Like, I got to the point where it’s like, sorta logged in (username in chatbox, but when you type something and press enter, your username appears as null in the chatbox, but main game screen and minimap are black) and it goes into a attempting to reestablish phase.[br][size=1]Posted on: August 26, 2007, 08:18:28 AM[/size][hr][quote=“Mod Taharok, post:6, topic:137084”]LOL TAHAROK POST[/quote]</p>
<p>hhhm, I’m thinking of a way to flush like this:<br>
add a [tt]clear()[/tt] method of void return type which contains:</p>
<p><code>    public void clear() {
        for(int i = 0; i == buffer.length(); i++)
            buffer[i] = null;
        setCurrentIndex(0);
    }</code></p>
<p>and make [tt]flushOutputStream()[/tt] look like this:</p>
<p><code>    public void flushOutputStream() throws IOException{
        dos.write(outStream.getBuffer(), 0, outStream.getBuffer().getCurrentIndex());
        dos.flush();
        outStream.clear();
    }</code></p>
<p>where [tt]outStream[/tt] is an RSStream which is for output, and </p><blockquote>dos</blockquote> is a [tt]new DataOutputStream(playerSocket.getOutputStream)();[/tt], where [tt]playerSocket[/tt] is self-explanatory <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">
