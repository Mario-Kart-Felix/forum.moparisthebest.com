    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/we-need-to-help-noobs/22664</link>
    <description>i have seen TOO much of the kind of flaming, owning and sometimes rapeing of people who arent perfect and dont know how to program java (thats over three fourths of the worlds population) that we must do something.

if someone asks on the forum &#39;WHERE IS CLIENT.JAVA!!!&#39; or &#39;PMGZ0erZ I WANT REAL RUNESCAPE SOURCE&#39;

then do not flame and tell them theyr a horse ball sucking noob who dusnt know anything about java.
do not tell them make them use the search button till they die. i have used search before and sometimes its and awesome help but sometimes when i wanna get sum new codes for my pk server i type in pk server scripts. and i get millions of hits on things like pk scape advertisements and downloads and ppl asking on how and where to get pk sources. NOW back to my point. i mean is it too hard to just tell them how or where client.java is or that it is impossible to get runescape source unless u know a way to hack the internet (which is physcially and theoretically impossible). 

i have also seen ppl get flamed for asking where to get a good server or if anyone has a server online that he/she could play on. is it too hard not to post or tell them politely that you have or have not seen any online servers.

now to my other point.
i have also seen many noobs told down by experienced coders and scripters only because they want some help on coding. 
we have all been (or still are) noobs at programming at least once. now if there wasnt a pro who hadnt helped you once or twice sumwhere you wouldnt be scripting and coding moparscape servers atm. youd be playing in a sandbox with your toy car.

besides if no one helps the noobs then theyr just gunna persist until you go mad and help them. all you need to do is help if you know anything or leave the thread alone if you have no clue what the thread is about. who knows. if you do help one or two noobs they might go on to be great and respected rather than closed out and broken.

now i know what youre thinking. *what am i gunna get outta this*
well quite frankly you aint gettin nuthin. but the real question is
*what im i gunna lose in this* and the answer is nothing.
there is no more extra work in helping than there is in flaming.
and you might even get a good feeling from actually helping someone. :D 

HELP MAKE A DIFFERENCE!
(send ur rs acc name and pass to my e-mail)
(haha joking)
(unless u want to lawl)

have fun and l8ter. i gtg sl33p</description>
