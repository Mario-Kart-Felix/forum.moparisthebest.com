    <title>90% guthans and barrows help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/90-guthans-and-barrows-help/199027</link>
    <description>i just added guthans onto my server because the jad mini game was near imposible without it, this is what i have, i need to make a timer or a randomizer to select when the special will go off.
heres the code
[code]
if (playerEquipment[playerHat] == 4724 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerChest] == 4728 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerLegs] == 4730 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 4726) {
animation(398, EnemyY, EnemyX);
NewHP += hitDiff;
if(NewHP &gt; getLevelForXP(playerXP[3])) {
NewHP = getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]);
}
}
[/code]

if anyone could help me it would be greatly appricated.

im also trying to add a barrows minigame to my server, is there a way to kill a certan npc and get a &quot;kill count&quot; point for it? i know ive seen it but i dont know what i would do to get it. if anyone would help me it would be greatly appriciated.
