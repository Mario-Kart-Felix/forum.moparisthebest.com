    <title>Cache editing server sided (custom items without needing to edit the client)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-editing-server-sided-custom-items-without-needing-to-edit-the-client/549262</link>
    <description>This is the showoff section so I just thought I&#39;d showoff something I just got working for the official server. I have no idea if this has been done before, but considering how far advanced some 317&#39;s are I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. Maybe even it&#39;s commonplace. I&#39;m out of the loop.

Basically, I can edit anything about a definition (or add new definitions) completely server sided and have them go out to any client that connects to the server.

The core behind this process is Graham/Discarded&#39;s cache system, as well as Graham&#39;s update server that is in ScapeEmulator. I simply added the ItemDefinition encode method (which I know has been done before) and wrote the simple 50 line editor.

Also worth noting that because the official server uses the cache definitions to populate its item information, there is no issue worrying about inconsistencies between the client and server. Anything that uses the items name (or any other value) server sided will update as well :)
[b][u]
Example (no client editing done)[/u][/b]

All I do is change the item id at the top and add any modifications I want into the modify method, like so:
[code=java]public final class ItemEditor {

    private static final int ITEM_ID = 4151;

    private static void modifyDefinition(ItemDefinition def) {
        def.name = &quot;My big black whip&quot;;
        def.originalModelColors = new short[] { 528 };
        def.modifiedModelColors = new short[] { 800 };
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println(&quot;Loading cache and finding item entry... &quot;);
            Cache cache = new Cache(FileStore.open(&quot;data/game/cache&quot;));
            Container tableContainer = Container.decode(cache.getStore().read(255, 19));
            ReferenceTable table = ReferenceTable.decode(tableContainer.getData());
            int fileId = ITEM_ID / 256;
            ReferenceTable.Entry entry = table.getEntry(fileId);

            if (entry == null) {
                System.out.println(&quot;No entry found!&quot;);
                cache.close();
                return;
            }

            Archive archive = Archive.decode(cache.read(19, fileId).getData(), entry.size());

            int archiveMember = 0;
            for (int member = 0; member &lt; entry.capacity(); member++) {
                ReferenceTable.ChildEntry childEntry = entry.getEntry(member);
                if (childEntry == null) {
                    continue;
                }
                int id = fileId * 256 + member;
                if (id == ITEM_ID) {
                    ItemDefinition definition = ItemDefinition.decode(id, archive.getEntry(archiveMember));
                    System.out.println(&quot;Item definition found and decoded, modifying...&quot;);
                    modifyDefinition(definition);
                    System.out.println(&quot;Writing changes to cache...&quot;);
                    cache.write(19, fileId, archiveMember, definition.encode());
                    break;
                }
                archiveMember++;
            }
            System.out.println(&quot;Cache item update complete!&quot;);
            cache.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}[/code]

Running the program will modify the cache, including updating any CRC/version numbers.

[code]
Loading cache and finding item entry... 
Item definition found and decoded, modifying...
Writing changes to cache...
Cache item update complete![/code]Nice.

After editing the cache, I restarted the server to push it to live. Someone that already had the client loaded and tries to log in will get this message:
[img]http://puu.sh/eIcOZ/6e7ac960ba.jpg[/img]

So I restart the client and log in...

Viola! One item updated!</description>

              <p>You better be using javafx…</p>
<p>I started writing a cache editor for rsc and man… it was really easy and high quality. For example, on item overlays i used a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/ui_controls/color-picker.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">color picker</a> which is quiet intuitive. As for listing the items, I used a modified version of a ListView (which, again, was really easy to do) that allowed each cell item in the list to update when a separate input field was typed into. I wish I had the source still.</p>
