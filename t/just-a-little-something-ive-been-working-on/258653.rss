    <title>Just a little something I&#39;ve been working on</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-a-little-something-ive-been-working-on/258653</link>
    <description>Well as the title suggests I&#39;ve been working on something lately that I haven&#39;t told anyone about yet. I have been creating a C# server. All packets are scripted in C# and are compiled at RUN time instead of at BUILD time. Basically this means anyone would be able to extend the server even without Visual Studio 2008 as long as they have the .NET framework 3.5.

The packet scripts are defined in a simple text file which looks something like this
[code]
107,Commands.cs
108,CloseInterface.cs
109,None
110,None
111,None
112,None
113,ActionButtons.cs
114,None
115,StillAlive.cs
116,None
[/code]

Not sure how much I will work on it or if it will ever be finished. If there is a good amount of interest I might release it to certain people, or not. I don&#39;t know.

Oh, and does anyone know of a way to get the update keys for outdated clients like say I wanted the update keys for v512 but obviously RS isnt on 512 anymore.</description>
