    <title>PI client runner isn&#39;t working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-client-runner-isnt-working/399524</link>
    <description>Orical-X V2 is a PI server i downloaded and im trying to run the client but it isn&#39;t running.

Their is something that is not pointing to a file.

Everytime i run the client it says Press any key to continue . . .

The client runner batch file code is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;@echo off
javaw -cp bin -Xms812m -Xmx1024m client 10 0 highmem members 32
pause&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
