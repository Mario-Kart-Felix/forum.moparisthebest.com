About the server
EnvyCraft is a 24 hour multiplayer survival server with the main focus on towns and economy. The server has very little down time and can hold up to 100 players!

When entering the server you can start your adventure whether that is building or mining like you would usually in Minecraft, you may also join towns to make friends and to create allies. Towns allow you building to be semi-protected unless a war has broken out between you and your enemies!

If your enemies are really bugging you, why don’t you get a hitman to do your dirty work? You can contract other players to their death so that they lose a certain amount of money!

Economy
EnvyCraft uses the BOSEconomy plugin and the currency is in Dollar. The economy has a balanced economy which has been maintained and will be kept under control. Earning money is simple as you can sell your resources on at the EnvyCraft shop at spawn.

 

Staff &amp; Website
All staff recruited at EnvyCraft are selected during recruitment processes on the website, which entails applications and interviews. Even when promoted to staff they have to abide to the staff rules this is to ensure players are be treated fairly.
