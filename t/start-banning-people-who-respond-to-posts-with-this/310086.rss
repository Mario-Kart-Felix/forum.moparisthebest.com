There are many more posts like this, but I don&#39;t want to waste my time finding them, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen them (ignore Johan&#39;s recent posts, he is being a douchebag because I was raging on IRC).



This is really fucking annoying and it is starting to piss me off (I&#39;m sure it&#39;s pissing other people off, too).</description>

The topic is locked, but this needs to be addressed.<br>
I didn’t say anywhere that the punishment was undeserved; I stated that, given the zero effect that the warning system has on private messages, the moderation was not the best choice because it had no effect on further usage of the PM system (I then went on to state that, had I been the one to deal with the issue, I would have made use of the ban system and a ban from posting/sending PMs for x amount of days).</p>
<p>Please don’t misconstrue what I have to say; it’s not fair on me, or anyone else, when you don’t quote them properly or omit crucial details.</p>

<p>Well it kind of depends where you want to draw the line, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Maniowns punishment is between me, maniown and the other administrators, however if you feel the handling of the topic in question(which was by me just fyi) was out of order, please contact moparisthebest and/or the other administrators.</p>
<p>EDIT: I NEARLY FORGOT, if any of you have any have a problem with a staff member’s actions you should contact an administrator(or mopar if it’s about an administrator(and if it’s about mopar, what are you still doing here?))</p>

moparisthebest, perhaps it would be best if all hidden posts went into some sort of queue that moderators can observe, like reports? i’d also like to stress that warnings <span class="bbcode-i">do absolutely nothing</span>, and if you disagree, maybe you can tell me why the same people are still getting warned after 2 years?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>That is true, this warning system is all but useless.  Luckily the warning system built into SMF 2 actually keeps ‘points’ on the record of accounts, so that if they get warned a certain number of times, they will be automatically banned.  It’s actually a good system.[/quote]<br>

<p>I agree.  You do realize there is no way for a moderator to punish someone for pms without banning them?  That moderator decided not to ban them, and instead issued a posting infraction.

<p>And if it add’s anything, the kid who he told to fuck off is now muted for starting shit with everyone on here. Obviously he was asking for it.</p>

<p>I agree.  You do realize there is no way for a moderator to punish someone for pms without banning them?  That moderator decided not to ban them, and instead issued a posting infraction.  What do you see wrong with that?</p>

<p>That is true, this warning system is all but useless.

              <p>and by the way, i hope the moderators are fucking happy. not only is this thread now riddled with spam, it also has a bunch of colorful circles all over the place in a pathetic attempt to serve up punishment. a job well done.</p>

              <p>moparisthebest, perhaps it would be best if all hidden posts went into some sort of queue that moderators can observe, like reports? i’d also like to stress that warnings <span class="bbcode-i">do absolutely nothing</span>, and if you disagree, maybe you can tell me why the same people are still getting warned after 2 years?</p>

<p>This is a perfect example of why we should have <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,403361.0.html" data-bbcode="true">thread level moderation</a>.</p>

<p>Sure, but then no one would be able to be punished if you remove the posts.</p>
<p>I don’t know that banning is the proper punishment, but warnings certainly are called for.</p>
