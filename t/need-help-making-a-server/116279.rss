              <p>this is the help sec. don’t go off on ppl for useing it, and besides most ppl like to take the easy path, and like someone there to help them if they got a qt. So don’t go off on him for asking for help. Thank you to all those ppl who take time and help ppl that are not so good with this, and don’t go off on ppl like some of you.</p>
<p>thanks again,<br>
smithgo</p>
<p>ps: like what he said but i think pipmp scape is a good server to start off with, i mean alot of ppl know how to work with it, you can get this server builder from mod t, its pritty good, i had a hard time with server building, could never get it. Now i can only get up on ham but w/e still works.</p>

              <p>Ok I Suggest You Download A Server Such As TestScape…Then Open Up The .Zip File,  Then Open Client.Java And Hold  CTRL+F and search for what ever the server is origanly called.  change that to the name you want.  Then close and save it, then open up client.java again and search for what ever the server admins name is and change it to yours.  That’s some stuff u should do first…</p>
