    <title>[508/317] Adding a Killing Counter [508/317]</title>

    <description>Ok, well this tutorial will show you how to make a simple kill counter. This can be used for all sorts of things but following this tutorial should help you learn what they really mean and how to use them.

Firstly we will need to make an int, so open [b]Player.java[/b] and search &#39;public static&#39;, then under the line you searched, add this int.
[code]

public static int deathCount = 0;
[/code]

This integer is public, so anything we add to it will change for the whole server. We do not need to add saving as this is for how many kills happened on the server from when it restarted (Per day or what ever).

So, then we need to add the code to +1 for each death, so you will need to find your death process then add the following code to it
[code]
p.deathCount = +1;
[/code]

That is the code for 508, for 317 I think you just take off the &#39;p.&#39;

Now we need to display the message to the server (in a command or when you click on an interface, I will show you how to do it when you click on an interface.

508:
[code]

case #;
p.frames.sendMessage(p, &quot;So far today &quot; +p.deathCount+ &quot; players have died on SERVERNAME&quot;;
break;
[/code]

317:
[code]

case #;
sendMessage(&quot;So far today &quot; +deathCount+ &quot; players have died on SERVERNAME&quot;;
break;
[/code]
