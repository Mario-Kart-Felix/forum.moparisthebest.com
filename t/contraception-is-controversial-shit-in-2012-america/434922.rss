    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;March 2 (Bloomberg) -- President Barack Obama called a college student to offer her his support after radio commentator Rush Limbaugh attacked her for advocating health insurance coverage for contraception.

Limbaugh&#39;s comments also drew a rebuke from Republican House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio.

Obama spoke with the student, Sandra Fluke, for several minutes, White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters today.

&quot;He wanted to offer his support to her,&quot; Carney said, adding that Obama considers Limbaugh&#39;s comments &quot;reprehensible.&quot; The president thanked Fluke for speaking out and expressed his disappointment that she was personally attacked, he said.

&quot;The fact that our political discourse has become debased in many ways is bad enough,&quot; Carney said. &quot;It is worse when it&#39;s directed at a private citizen who was simply expressing her views on a matter of public policy.&quot;

On his March 1 show, Limbaugh said that Fluke, a Georgetown University law school student, is a &quot;slut&quot; and a &quot;prostitute,&quot; according to a transcript posted on his website. Today, he said on his show that Fluke &quot;admits to having so much sex that she can&#39;t afford it anymore. And thus, a new welfare entitlement must be created so that society will pay for it.&quot;

Quicken Loans Inc. of Detroit suspended advertising on the Limbaugh show due to his &quot;inflammatory comments along with valuable feedback from our clients and staff,&quot; chairman Dan Gilbert, the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, said on Twitter.

All-Male Panel

Fluke was barred from testifying last month before a House committee on what became an all-male panel talking about women&#39;s access to birth control. She appeared a week later before House Democrats and discussed the need for such access.

During their phone conversation, &quot;he encouraged me and thanked me for speaking out about the concerns of American women,&quot; Fluke said in an interview with MSNBC.

&quot;What was really personal for me was that he said to tell my parents that they should be proud,&quot; Fluke said.

Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, asked about Limbaugh&#39;s comments in a CNN interview, said the talk show host was &quot;being absurd.&quot;

&quot;But that&#39;s, you know, an entertainer can be absurd,&quot; Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, said. &quot;He&#39;s in a very different business than I am.&quot;

Fundraising Appeal

Santorum rival Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, walked by the camera without responding when a reporter asked about the Limbaugh controversy, CNN reported.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent a fundraising appeal shortly after Fluke was excluded from the House hearing.

Boehner criticized Limbaugh through a spokesman, Michael Steel.

&quot;The speaker obviously believes the use of those words was inappropriate, as is trying to raise money off the situation,&quot; Steel said.

In an e-mail to supporters, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California decried the &quot;vicious and inappropriate attacks&quot; leveled against Fluke.

The controversy over birth control arose after the Obama administration initially required religiously affiliated universities and hospitals to pay for contraception coverage for their employees, with the exception of houses of worship. The administration then modified the rule so that insurers, not the institutions themselves, would pay for the coverage.

The Democratic-controlled Senate yesterday blocked Republican-sponsored legislation that would let any employer or insurer exclude coverage for any health service that violates their religious beliefs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>because condoms don’t prevent sexually transmitted diseases and birth control pills don’t prevent unwanted pregnancies</p>
<p>the nhs in the uk is pretty big on preventative medicine, condoms are given free and many stop smoking programs are offered for free as two examples that come to mind, it costs the tax payer a lot less money to give people free condoms than it does to  pay for abortions or support unwanted pregnancies</p>

<p>What you don’t seem to understand that even though this might seem an expensive part of healthcare (it isn’t, but whatever), you don’t take into account the effects of unwanted pregnancy. Both financial and emotional. Contraception is cheaper than abortion, adoption, or raising a child when you’re under ~20. Not to mention the emotional damage, which can result in financial costs too.</p>

<p>Is having sex not an option? Condoms are ridiculously cheap and if you are having so much sex that you cant afford condoms then obviously we are looking at a bigger problem.

i think the goal was to aid people who can’t afford birth control. there’s other forms of birth control that are more effective and a little more expensive (ex: pill). also, around here a 25 or 30 pack of magnums is like $27 or so, which at a use rate of 1 per day (which i’d consider a normal rate for a consistent relationship - at least in my own experience) would result in a cost of ~$1 per day for birth control costs; which may not seem like much, but you must also take into account the people who are unemployed or are operating on minimum wage; do they not deserve the same ease of access to (in my opinion necessity) birth control?</p>
<p>other things to consider are failure rates of types of birth control. usually, the more expensive, the less likely of a failure.</p>

<p>What you don’t seem to understand that even though this might seem an expensive part of healthcare (it isn’t, but whatever), you don’t take into account the effects of unwanted pregnancy. Both financial and emotional. Contraception is cheaper than abortion, adoption, or raising a child when you’re under ~20. Not to mention the emotional damage, which can result in financial costs too.</p>
<p>You can say that it’s their own responsibility, but how responsible is a 16 year old?</p>

<p>Who says that the government doesn’t have a right to force all private organizations to provide for a decent health insurance?</p>
<p>Doesn’t your constitution give the federal government the right to provide security for the people?</p>
<p>There is a alternative that prevents this issue, make the Gov. responsible to provide contraception for those who need it.</p>

              <p>I think the REAL issue is when the fuck did CONTRACEPTION become part of HEALTHCARE?</p>
<p>So since as part of Obama care since Jack wants to fuck Jill and not have a baby I have to provide my tax money so they can pay for condoms and birth control pills? Health care is to help preventing diseases and keeping your body functioning properly. Contraception stretches that fucking considerably. Dont want to have a baby? Either buy the condom and birth control pills yourself or don’t fuck. Im sure you will all start to mention all the other benefits of the bill for health but thats not the main reason the pill is used anyway. It comes down to government control over shit like this anyway that causes all the problems since instead of a person purchasing a private plan and picking and choosing what things they want covered such as contraception, we are all forced to have this shit and pay for it.</p>
<p>Also im Catholic and I support peoples choice to use contraception and I believe that the use of it is fine, I love how you think all members of the catholic church automatically agree 100% with everything they say/do. That’s like me saying since there is 1 radical Muslim that believes in terrorism, then every Muslim must be a terrorist.</p>
<p>Also @ the article Fluke is a fucking cunt whore. Are you fucking kidding me, she basically just said birth control costs are so high for me because I fuck so much and I can’t afford it so we need to have another ENTITLEMENT to pay for this</p>
<p>This country is seriously fucked anyway I just look at all of my class mates in college and they just think its a fucking party, most of them are business “majors” and they dont learn/know shit then they wonder why everyone else has a job at a real company and they are still working at the fucking grocery store in their last year of their college degree.</p>
<p>/end rant</p>
