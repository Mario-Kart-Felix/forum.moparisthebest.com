    <description>Today, sadly, I must provide information about my leave of absence. I been thinking this through for a while, and have come to the conclusion that I can no longer be apart of this community. No. This isn&#39;t a leaving thread that lists all the wrong in the community; however, a more friendly approach. I&#39;d rather not get into detail why I am leaving but I can safely say that my time is spent more online than outside, so I guess that pretty much sums things up.

I&#39;d like to thank each and everyone of you who helped, talked, and were friends to me. You made my time online enjoyable and much more fun :) Even through thick and thin with some people, it&#39;s all in the past, I don&#39;t honestly care about past arguments anymore, and I also wish for others that I may have annoyed, hurt, or otherwise criticized to please forgive me. I&#39;d like to make everyone&#39;s online time enjoyable, just like mine was, and for the most part, I tried that. I helped others when needed, etc, etc.

Well, enough of the corny old stuff. Anyways, finally, I&#39;d like to thank the MoparScape and MITB Communities for the fun they&#39;ve brought me and I wish EVERYONE the BEST of luck on their further developments. I will most likely be logging on to see what this community can further achieve; however, I will also most likely NOT post. Just quick logins and logouts. I expect great things, even though this community is stuck in mud right now. You&#39;ve got great potential with helpful people like Yz85racer, Varek (Stork), etc. The moderators are a wonderful source of information. Follow their lead and take any advice you can from them. They&#39;re not your average forumer. They were chosen for specific reasons.

Again, good luck to everyone with whatever they may be using this community for.

Goodbye.


Sincerely,
Adam
