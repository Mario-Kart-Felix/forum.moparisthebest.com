[null]: Exception: Encrypted packet Id was 0 but expected 10
[null]: Exception: Encrypted packet Id was 51 but expected 10
[/code]

Code in client.java (Server)
[code]			tmp = inStream.readUnsignedByte();
			if (tmp != 10) {
				Exception(&quot;Encrypted packet Id was &quot; + tmp + &quot; but expected 10&quot;);
				return;
			}[/code]

i have a basic idea of what needs to happen but no idea how to do it i know that either i need to edit the client so it sends the packet id 10 instead of a random one every time or allow the server to accept a random one every time. i dont really want to be spoonfed so if someone could just try to explain it to be a little better first that would help.</description>
