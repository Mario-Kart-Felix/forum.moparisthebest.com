    <description>-NOTE- 
for advanced RSPoser users...this can be difficult to understand if your a starter

hey guys, i know you probably see me in here asking for help alot but this time i really need help with 2 things which i will explain throughout, i will try to make it as specific as possible.

I was bored so i started to make animation for a steel titan so i start making the priority settings using meta (here is a pic to show if i may have did something wrong)

[img]http://i42.tinypic.com/nvdr86.jpg[/img]

Ok then i move on to my TSKIN settings and here is what i have.

[img]http://i40.tinypic.com/zursq8.jpg[/img]

I don&#39;t know what i did wrong but i will explain. After i did all the PRI, TSKIN, and vertex weights, i made it into a .dat file (there were no errors), then i opened it as a model and it successfully projected the model. Then i click &quot;open anim file&quot; and click on animation. Then once again, none of the dots moved EXCEPT for number 5 (which is the hand). as shown below...

[img]http://i43.tinypic.com/vdmj4m.jpg[/img]

But no matter how much i tried rotating/moving it, it just wouldnt cooperate, and not move at all. Anyone know what might be causing this. I set the pri, tskin, and vskin1 settings, what might be the problem.

==============

Ok here is my 2nd problem, i decided to make animation data with the kojack weilding the staff of light and i made the pri and tskin and vertices etc. settings, as shown below...

[img]http://i39.tinypic.com/vhvxqw.jpg[/img]

Then i opened it in the Datmaker, everything projected except for the staff. Which is also shown here...

[img]http://i42.tinypic.com/f4labr.jpg[/img]

Any reason why its doing this or what im doing wrong?</description>

My current… abandoned… version is so screwed up, it’ll load models perfectly, i fixed that finally, cept when it loads some animations, all of a sudden you can’t edit them and no matter how much you shout at the computer screen, it doesn’t fix the problem.<br>
Needs porting to jogl.</p>

              <p>hmm, i have an idea, since the last rsposer i downloaded came with a 508 version demon, i might be able to use its palette data for the steel titan since whenever i convert it into a MQOv2, it includes the materials. U think this might work?</p>

              <p>1st one, your not using the correct animation file for the NPC, these have completely different skin lists to player characters and are usually unique for each NPC group. Seeing as that’s not a 317 NPC, you’ll need to convert the animation file yourself from 474/508 format to 317 format.</p>
<p>2nd one, looks like your staff and character models are in different objects, by rights it should be telling you there is a count error.</p>
