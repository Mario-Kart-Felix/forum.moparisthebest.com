<p>He means Windows XP and why post not answering his question?</p>
<p>You can host a server on Windows XP or Windows Vista, I don’t think either runs a server better than the other. From experience I like to use Windows XP to host a server and play around with the files because stuff is easier to find and I just like the overall interface better than Vista and Vista is more buggier. I’d roll with XP but it depends of what you like.</p>
