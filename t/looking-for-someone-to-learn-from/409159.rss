    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-someone-to-learn-from/409159</link>
    <description>Not sure if this is the correct section, but i am working on a project - formationx base
and i was just looking to see if there is anyone out there that would like to work with me. Im new to codeing and as far as i know im pretty decent at &quot;editing&quot;. If anyone out there wants to help, i would be very gratefull.

I ran my first server couple weeks ago and managed 30 people in 5 days, 
My current knoledge extends to - Adding shops, npc&#39;s, editing things, following basic tuts, and ect. Not so good with webhosts, dont really understand mysql..

Sorry for being new at this but you know everyone was new to codeing once in their lives.. so once again if anyone out there wants to help, i would be very greatful!</description>
