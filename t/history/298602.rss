              <p>late '05 - kaitneiks - wL server made to test bots for actual RS, was leaked and released, few people made servers from it.<br>
early '06 - kaitneiks gone, mitb started this site.<br>
mid '06 - main server was cheezscape, fuckton of faggots started to get wind of it all<br>
mid-late '06 - 9999999 shitty servers created by everyone and their mums, few larger servers stand out and last for a while, most close after a week. mitb and mscp split to two sites.<br>
early '07-now - </p>

<p>a guy named wL was trying new ways of testing his bots without the risks.(if i remember correctly) so he wrote a server. he released POC(Proof of concept) servers being the original rs2 server and then blakescape d-boosted. then people decided to work on the shitty POC server wL wrote. And it developed into this shit.</p>
