<p>who gives a shit if its vaults server, wouldn’t it have taken much longer to even code it from scratch? I understand he should’ve have respected it was his code but vault’s chance is gone now.[/quote]<br>
The point of it being vaults server means its full of completely and utterly useless code laced with idiotic mistakes and dupe methods left right and center. The only thing PRS06 has going for it is the player base, anyone with half a brain can see that.</p>

I haven’t posted in a while<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Im extremely confused why all moparscape staff can’t be made staff on Project06. Make it a moparscape community project. I understand there’s all this retarded loveing drama. But really, you guys have the same roots, from a website you’ve been on for years. You can’t get over this stupid shit and just work on something together? Hell even combine sources and change the name to something new? What is the major detail blocking this? I see nothing. Are you guys pre-teens because thats the only thing that could get this argument to this level of immaturity. I’ve been here since 2006. This isn’t my old account, I made one just to post this. I’ve highly respected the mods here for years. I no longer do.</p>
<p>Edit: KO9 your moderaters are shit. Any moparscape moderators would make the server instantly 100x better.[/quote]</p>
<p>For once someone who wasn’t lieing about their join date… I checked for other accounts associated with this one and there is one from July 22, 2006, 10:06:09 AM.</p>
<p>Weird you would post here after all that time lol</p>

        <p>No point discussing who it was going to go to or who may be able to run it. The fact is I am running it and personally I think I am running it rather well given the circumstances. We are all aware of the situation, David was using the 2006sscape leaked source, I took over just over a week ago and have been recruiting devs to help fix the massive array of problems with the source code. Things were very chaotic at the start due to multiple factors that most people should be aware of anyway but now things are settled down, we’re getting into the swing of things and there is a lot of work being done to turn the server from a broken source into a beautifully coded server (which won’t happen until our long term goal is completed).</p>

<p>To all the haters, I honestly do know see why you are disliking me over all of this. I am not responsible for the 2006scape source code I am just dealing with what I have been given, much in the same way that Taharok/mitb would have if they were given the server over me. Additionally as I have said many times before I have a very good rep in RSC ps and ran a very successful server for two years. A lot of people genuinely regard me as one of the best RSC ps owners there has ever been. You may not agree with these thoughts and that is your prerogative.</p>
<p>With regards to silab and the rest of the people exploiting the server, look we all know that right now I cannot stop you from exploiting the server, bugs take time to be made aware of and fixed and if it wasn’t one of you it would be someone else doing the exploiting.

I have been a good member and mod on these forums for number of years now and have many many threads that I provided support in. If you want to hate me then fine but at least have a good reason other than that I own a big server or that I am using 2006scape source which I was completely unaware of right up until the final server talks with David were being made.</p>

I think it’s just a url shortner. However, if it were a money making link then that would reveal the real purpose of PSR06 to be the money incentive.</p>

<p>To all the haters, I honestly do know see why you are disliking me over all of this. I am not responsible for the 2006scape source code I am just dealing with what I have been given, much in the same way that Taharok/mitb would have if they were given the server over me. Additionally as I have said many times before I have a very good rep in RSC ps and ran a very successful server for two years. A lot of people genuinely regard me as one of the best RSC ps owners there has ever been. You may not agree with these thoughts and that is your prerogative.</p>
<p>With regards to silab and the rest of the people exploiting the server, look we all know that right now I cannot stop you from exploiting the server, bugs take time to be made aware of and fixed and if it wasn’t one of you it would be someone else doing the exploiting. However there really is no reason to make any of this personal. I have done nothing to deserve a lot of the hate I have been receiving around here. I have been a good member and mod on these forums for number of years now and have many many threads that I provided support in. If you want to hate me then fine but at least have a good reason other than that I own a big server or that I am using 2006scape source which I was completely unaware of right up until the final server talks with David were being made.<br>

<p>I don’t understand why this server is so popular if I’m honest. It is filled with bugs (don’t say “I know there are so many bugs, its beta”, because by using your own source instead of a stolen one (using something that is leaked is as close as possible to stealing it) that wouldn’t be a problem), the staff all appear to be ignorant and then it’s entirely oriented around earning money.</p>
