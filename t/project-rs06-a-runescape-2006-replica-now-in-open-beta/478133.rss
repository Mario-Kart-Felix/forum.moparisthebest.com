<p>It was my post with davids story and how everyone is being as most childish as they can with Frell’s scare tatic debunked. I have the log of davids story and if you want it pm me, I don’t have what i wrote unfortunatly as i thought of saving it too because it was going to be deleted, because anything said bad about RR is deleted. Basically it’s summed up in this image.</p>

<p>Congrats on the mods though, they are half done cleaning this thread.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Axel”]As Ko9(ollie) &amp; Albi did everything possible to prevent me from informing the members on PRS06 about the truth, I will do it here.</p>
<p>4rth January 2013 google specifically Ko9 was contacted by Jagex with a first initial threat of closure and copyright notice, this does not mean much, it has a 30 days response requirement.</p>
<p>This could potentially be faught off or ignored for up to like 6 months maybe more, but when me and Ko9 discussed this I felt morally obligated to post it as a news and to ensure that “we” (google) will do everything possible to fight the copyright claims by Jagex Ltd.</p>
<p>However Ko9 did not feel it would be good for the community to know, as this would cause lots of drama, panic &amp; people would stop donating.<br>
I said I would think about it, and that I would not be on the entire 5th february due to birthday celebrations.</p>
<p>I returned 6th February 2013 looked on IRC and saw I was kicked/banned from every google related channel, then I saw the password for my account ‘Axel’ was wrong on forums, I then read news as Guest and saw what had happened, Albi &amp; Ko9 had made up false discrediting lies to make my crediblity less if I ever decided to tell people about the Jagex copyright issue.</p>
<p>I was not corrupted, by any means I was the only honest person in the entire staff left, I didn’t spawn items for people Ko9 did, check out “katsumii” his online net gf from America who has custom items and a bank full of everything you can imagine, even items that do not yet exist. Despite her being a player. Ohh and the accusations of RWT? I did not do that either, I exposed Albi from evidence submitted by someone to me on Skype that Silab (silabsoft) had gathered evidence that Albi was RWT’ing on powerbot and making $$.</p>
<p>Another funfact is, Ollie (ko9) and mod 666 (slayer) were ridiculed out of Projectrsc about 7 months ago because Ko9 created a special place called botcastle with command ::botcastle so that he and his friends could bot there in private, with special mob spawns items, everything, when this was revealed slayer was permanently banned by Pompano (pomp is the true owner / leader of all the projects) Ko9 was also doomed to be kicked, I have confidential logs of me and pompano thinking of best way to dispose of Ko9 without causing comotion or him trying to damage the projects - but when David was ill and said he can’t continue on the google project then pomp didn’t know what he should do, either give it to Ollie (ko9) or to frell+runerebels owner. It ended up in hands of Ollie, who has had me keeping him upright and partially honest most of the time, I have been the only good influence on google, and I am afraid that now google is doomed, Despite it may be running for next 4-8 months without a jagex takeover - I feel the game I worked for, I faught for is destroyed by the corruption management that leads it.</p>
<p>The panic attack and swift removal of me just to ensure that ko9 would keep getting his donation money is a disgusting move, anything to silence me from informing people. And then to falsely discredit me like that, going on my account and pretending to be me to make a somewhat credible lie with the only purpose to discredit me, simply and outright disgusting.</p>
<p>I think people should stand up for what is right.<br>
I won’t be defending myself on here any further or on google, frankly I am tired of the drama that RSPS can bring.<br>

              <p>Quit derailing this thread. If you aren’t going to post about the game itself (IE: the server you actually play the game you all love so dearly on…) then do not post at all.</p>
<p>What does that mean you might ask? Don’t talk about axel, don’t talk about k09 and his ‘mismanagement’, don’t slander sinisoul (we all make our own decisions, he’s a big boy and so is K09), quit slandering eachother(see: everyone jumping onto a side… or a dick for that matter)</p>
<p>Leave the discussion to your inbox or don’t discuss at all.</p>
