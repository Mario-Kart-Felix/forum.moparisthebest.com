obviously we’re out to earn nothing but money. i mean, we don’t have a $550 bill to pay every month.</p>

<p>You HAVE to pay for it? No, you obviously didn’t read into it. You pay $25 for your clan to have it’s own section on the forums so you can have discussions with them and make threads and events without having to use another website. It’s a convince thing and is not NEEDED by clans. If they don’t want to use it they are more then welcome to keep using the old Clan Discussion section with their thread.</p>

<p>Really? So you are saying if everyone used their own source bugs would never happen? KO9 is not at fault for using the stolen source, they are even working to get their own source. It’s like you don’t even know any information and just talk nonsense. Where do you get the information about entirely around earning money. They have bills to pay every month. Do you have 550 dollars laying around every month to go towards a server? If you do you should host a server for free and work on it non-stop for the enjoyment of others while they don’t give you a single dime. They are coming up with incentives to donate so they can pay the bills while working for the server.</p>

<p>Like that matters? Asking for $25 for that is still retarded. Don’t try to justify charging $25 for ANYTHING. And no, I didn’t read into it but a board title of ‘Clan recruitment threads (requires $25 donation for thread approval)’ speaks for itself.</p>
<p>Having your own site seems better anyways…</p>

Thanks for the supprt.</p>
<p>By the way the costs are so high right now because we just added the system and was trying it out. We will lower the costs once we are able to automate things and users are able to manage their own groups.</p>

<p>This is exactly it. The reason for the whole thing is so people can have somewhere for the clan to do things while support the server they play on. It’s just that simple. Thinking about donating 25-50 dollars and you also have a clan? Then you can get these benefits while helping the server out. (Now some people do agree that the price is high and they have made good points to it, so i can see it being lowered in the near future)</p>
<p>Why do people think that’s what they are paying for. It’s just a donation with added benefits. Does it give them some item that owns everyone in game? No, it’s just a colored name on the forums and some flair with a section for their clan or group. It’s a small cool thing you get for donating and in the end it helps out the server and devs for the hard work they are putting into the game. These people spend hours upon hours bug fixing, adding content, and improving their site. Do you think they should not be helped out a little bit with costs?</p>
<p>Maybe i should just stop coming onto these moparscape forums. It seems the P-Server community just likes to name call or insult things without looking into things or use common sense.</p>

<p>They now can with added benefits. It’s some incentive. Do they get more recognition? Hardly. If a clan is good people will join it. If it’s bad they won’t.</p>
<p>And also KO9 it’s no problem. You are playing with the hand that was given you. IMO You are doing the best you can with what you were given and don’t deserve any of the hate you are given.</p>

The more you visit the more I see why you are with such a server, you as a person seem to be motivated entirely by money and power. People shouldn’t need any form of benefit to donate to a server, how do you think we pay for our hosting services? Magic money? No. People will donate to what they like, if they play your server and they like it they shouldn’t need any incentive to donate. Also, that isn’t really donating. If someone is donating to a charity they don’t usually receive a reward other than something very small e.g a poppy, a lapel pin etc, so why should it be any different here? They aren’t donating for anything, they are purchasing. If they were donating the recognition as a donor should be all that is needed, the same way you would show off your lapel pin; with a crown in front of your name. That should be more than enough, but when it gets into things such as this it’s purchasing, it’s not donating. It’s giving others an upper hand over other clans, it isn’t fair to those who haven’t got the money to support their clan. If you would just tear your eyes away from the money possibilities the server would be a much better place to be around and you may even gain some respect.</p>

Exactly my point of view, the majority of the people defending it are the people who have something to lose. Also, towards him rattling on about the payments for the hosting I can almost guarantee that their google adsense account generates enough to pay for that alone. When we had Zealusion our adsense was making over 400 per month and that was with a 60 player server.  Think what a 2100+ player server is bringing in.</p>

<p>This is exactly it. The reason for the whole thing is so people can have somewhere for the clan to do things while support the server they play on. It’s just that simple. Thinking about donating 25-50 dollars and you also have a clan? Then you can get these benefits while helping the server out. (Now some people do agree that the price is high and they have made good points to it, so i can see it being lowered in the near future)</p>
<p>Why do people think that’s what they are paying for. It’s just a donation with added benefits. Does it give them some item that owns everyone in game? No, it’s just a colored name on the forums and some flair with a section for their clan or group. It’s a small cool thing you get for donating and in the end it helps out the server and devs for the hard work they are putting into the game. These people spend hours upon hours bug fixing, adding content, and improving their site. Do you think they should not be helped out a little bit with costs?</p>
<p>Maybe i should just stop coming onto these moparscape forums. It seems the P-Server community just likes to name call or insult things without looking into things or use common sense.</p>

<p>They now can with added benefits. It’s some incentive. Do the get more recognition? Hardly. If a clan is good people will join it. If it’s bad they won’t.<br>

The more you visit the more I see why you are with such a server, you as a person seem to be motivated entirely by money and power. People shouldn’t need any form of benefit to donate to a server, how do you think we pay for our hosting services? Magic money? No. People will donate to what they like, if they play your server and they like it they shouldn’t need any incentive to donate. Also, that isn’t really donating. If someone is donating to a charity they don’t usually receive a reward other than something very small e.g a poppy, a lapel pin etc, so why should it be any different here? They aren’t donating for anything, they are purchasing. If they were donating the recognition as a donor should be all that is needed, the same way you would show off your lapel pin; with a crown in front of your name. That should be more than enough, but when it gets into things such as this it’s purchasing, it’s not donating. It’s giving others an upper hand over other clans, it isn’t fair to those who haven’t got the money to support their clan. If you would just tear your eyes away from the money possibilities the server would be a much better place to be around and you may even gain some respect.[/quote]<br>
Because I’m going to gain so much respect with a stolen, broken source, no - or largely *inactive developers (which a server without profit would likely become, been there). I made about 189$ profit after next month’s server cost and I am paying almost all of that to a dev. Do I not deserve anything for spending 18+ hour days running the project for the enjoyment of players? It is not like I am forcing people to donate. They donate because they like the idea of the groups and because they like and wish to support the server + devs. I have said before the costs are high because quite frankly it is a LOT of work to constantly make changes to +30 usergroups which is what will happen once the price decreases. I am writing support so this system is all automated/user manageable and then the costs will drop sharply.</p>

<p>Really? So you are saying if everyone used their own source bugs would never happen? KO9 is not at fault for using the stolen source, they are even working to get their own source. It’s like you don’t even know any information and just talk nonsense. Where do you get the information about entirely around earning money. They have bills to pay every month. Do you have 550 dollars laying around every month to go towards a server? If you do you should host a server for free and work on it non-stop for the enjoyment of others while they don’t give you a single dime. They are coming up with incentives to donate so they can pay the bills while working for the server.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have seen no reason for the bugs except for “oh the source we chose was full of bugs”. And I’m sure that KO9 could agree with the other staff that their own source would be better… why do they need to “work” to get it? Also, why are the bills so high?</p>
<p>I got the idea that they are entirely based around money because it’s obvious that they are. They don’t provide “incentives to donate”, they provide <span class="bbcode-b">products</span> to <span class="bbcode-b">purchase</span>. A charity earns money to support itself, a business earns money to profit - I’m sure you can see where this server falls.</p>
<p>(I must say I did have a little chuckle when I noticed that barely anybody except the server’s staff are defending it)<br>
[/quote]<br>
Exactly my point of view, the majority of the people defending it are the people who have something to lose. Also, towards him rattling on about the payments for the hosting I can almost guarantee that their google adsense account generates enough to pay for that alone. When we had Zealusion our adsense was making over 400 per month and that was with a 60 player server.  Think what a 2100+ player server is bringing in.[/quote]<br>
And all the people attacking it are from rival servers/dev teams, what is your point? Obviously there is a conflict of issues here. There is a mod war here basically and I am not really impartial to clean the topic up. An admin really needs to sort out what happens with this topic… We cannot continue fighting about stupid things, this community needs to grow up or shut up. If you cannot act mature just stay out of this thread. If no-one dues anything I guess I will just request the topic is closed and quietly disappear from moparscape which is a shame as I have devoted a lot of my time here over the past ~4 years…</p>

So get developers who will develop for free rather than be paid, it really isn’t that hard. As a moderator of MoparScape you really must know this. There’s been some absolutely brilliant servers created from developers found on MoparScape which as you’re well aware of there’s no payments involved there. If you would just get it into your mind that the money isn’t needed besides the hosting and the AdSense will cover that no problem whatsoever. Towards your comment on the respect part, for one, you’d gain my respect and many others like me. I’m not interested in what the server is that’s running, I’m interested in the way the community is ran and how the staff are handled. I ran a leeched PI without anything except the names changed to over 300 players, I then changed the home and added an EP system to over 600 players. It isn’t the content that you have, it’s the way you are run. If the server is ran smoothly with very little inconvenience to the players and with staff that are well organised and well informed the players will flow in. Anyone who’s ran a successful server before will know that.</p>
<p>Also, this isn’t anything to do with my affiliation with RuneRebels. This is to do with the way you are acting, your players are acting and the way you’ve organised the whole thing. It’s ran in a way that’s pointed towards money and that just doesn’t settle with me. If I had nothing to do with RR I’d still be posting this.</p>

<p>As I’m not from a rival server and I’m not part of a development team so I presume you don’t mean that I’m attacking you, which is good because I’m not. I have been invited to the server quite a few times yet every time I go on it I immediately lose interest. People clearly think that there is something wrong with the way that the server is being run, and I agree with them. I’ve seen staff insult people and I’ve seen constant excuses - people don’t care what source you are using but if you are going to use a source then at least use one that isn’t riddled with bugs, especially now that there are so many 2006 remakes because all it will take for your $550/month to become futile is for one of those other servers to fix the bugs that you can’t.</p>

(I must say I did have a little chuckle when I noticed that barely anybody except the server’s staff are defending it)<br>

<p>And the only people who are attacking it are rival servers and devs. Right now it’s just a huge “He said this and He said that” match. Who knows why they are allowed to continue to post in this thread. Many of the players who play the server don’t use the moparscape forums. The only reason i have is because of the Drama Frell started, as i didn’t even think moparscape was still around.</p>
<p>If the server is bad players will leave and you will see the drop in players. Obviously this is not the case as the server is hitting the player cap every day.[/quote]<br>
Just because I’m affiliated with RuneRebels doesn’t change anything. RuneRebels stopped attacking this days ago, this is purely from my own views. If you look at my last post in here you’ll see why I’m challenging the server.</p>
<p>As everyone can see a once at large sorcerer by the name of Frell created a prophecy before leaving the aforementioned realm of PRS06<br>
