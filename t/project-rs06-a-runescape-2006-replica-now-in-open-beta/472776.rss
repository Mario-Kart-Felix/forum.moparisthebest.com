Vault if you didn’t let your sources escape from under your nose, you wouldn’t be questioning fake thieves. We can get this straight, this isn’t your source. From what I know, David programmed most of this by himself. If he ‘stole’ any of your content, then you can blame yourself for letting it get leaked.<br>

Even if thats true, Vault is the biggest faggot alive</p>

              <p>Ollie why don’t you talk to ry6000 and work out a compromise? Use ry6000’s source on your server/website (since david bought a very expensive one hate to see it go to waste),ry6000 would be head in command and Ollie you would be second in command? I mean a great source+server+big player base isn’t that what everyone wants? If you don’t agree with this im sure you two can work out a different type of negotiation. Point is a split community isn’t good imagine what you guys could accomplish working together!</p>

              <p>Just thought i’d add this:</p>
<p>This is what happened.</p>
<p>Frell stood in the midddle of catherby earlier today, freely talking about how david “planned to give the server to rune rebels” and that “project06 is using the leaked RS2006 source”.</p>
<p>Shortly after a topic was made by mortimer, a spectator who was there, who posted screenshots from the conversation. Frell also apparently livestreamed himself saying some of that stuff or something along those lines, apparently.</p>
<p>Frell responded to this topic, saying that he wasn’t hacked, and attempted to hide the thread from KO9 by using his powers to change the topic title to something unrelated, and also begging the topic starter to change the name as well when he kept changing it back.</p>
<p>He then said that he’d lie and post a topic in the news forum saying that he was hacked- which he did.  However on page 2 of this topic he said to ignore that lie and that he was never actually hacked.  He deleted the original topic which wasn’t made by him as the topic starter kept changing the title of it.</p>
<p>He posted several times in both of those threads, every time he would have the link to his server in his post.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, unrelated to this (apparently) miss siliabsoft started a topic on the forum, freely giving away how “easily exploitable” the server is, and saying that people were duping phats in varrock. Don’t know if this is even true or not.</p>
