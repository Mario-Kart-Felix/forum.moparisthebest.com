        <p>we have short-mid-long term plans do you guys really think with our servers maxed our frequently at 2000+ players and within the week I have had the server that we could seriously have migrated the whole thing? Especially with all the drama I had to deal with thanks to some of the people here. Mods spreading lies the first day I wake up, dupes the next few days, DA exploits, remote banking exploits etc. This on top of the fact that I didn’t have the source code for the first few days and it took me a while after that to get devs and a proper team together bearing in mind all my xp in the past 4 years is rsc and I have only looked at rsps briefly that I could really have actually swapped to another source right away? I was pretty overwhelmed, stressed out and just becoming familiar with the entire thing. Really if you guys think I would have done better swapping everything over when david had been running and fixing that source for months then you are just crazy lol. Anyway I’m signing out of this drama fest. Sorry guys I’m too busy for our little arguments now =/. If you guys want to stop being dicks and actually help me or play on the server then contact me @ <a href="mailto:ko9mscp@projectrs06.com">ko9mscp@projectrs06.com</a> or on rizon nick ollie. Cya.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you ignored everything I said and led it in a completely different way! How about you face the money factor and let us really see what you’re doing with it all, because I speak for a lot of people when I say we all know that the money isn’t just given out to developers and hosting. Primarily the AdSense is what I would like to see, that’s bound to be raking in a fortune. I’d even say quite a bit more than what Moparisthebest gets from our AdSense. I’ll contact you on Rizon at some point so we can really have this out because I totally disagree with what you’re doing.</p>

RuneRebels has 6 very good developers working on it, none of them are paid. The money also seems to be being wasted, see: Albi.</p>

<p>Why do you suggest that? I don’t believe in what the server stands for, there’s simply nothing you can do about me expressing my views on the matter. If all the server stands for is taking advantage of the money that 2000 players offers then I don’t see why those players shouldn’t be passed onto a more deserving place.</p>

I’ve already stated that just because I have an affiliation with RuneRebels doesn’t mean anything. If you knew who I am you’d realise I hate anyone who turns the entire server into something to do with money. One of the main reasons I’m with RR is because the fact that none of them care for the money side of it. All that’s happening here is another 2006-Scape in the making and I’m sure myself and others wouldn’t like to see that happen. This community has the potential to be something amazing, if it continues this way then it’ll run into some serious issues and players will start dropping. I’m not here to argue, I’m not arguing with anyone we’re merely discussing and trying to find out where the money is going and what’s the actual motive behind the server.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We may not NEED paid developers but I really don’t see why it is so much of an issue having them. It is my belief that we will achieve our development goals much quicker and more efficiently than we would do with just devs who are volunteering. I worked on a project for 6-7 months prior to joining prs06 where money was a real issue because we decided to wait before charging subs and the server took 0 revenue for the entire 7 months, not much dev was done and a lot of the staff and players lost interest. I think the server would have gone a much different path if we had taken the decision to charge subs from day 1 but that is kind of a tangent I guess.</p>
<p>I would much rather have mature and responsible developers who are hard working, dedicated and loyal and who would like to be rewarded monetarily for their time than to ‘hire’ developers who just spend what time they can, slowly lose interest etc. You have to realise that this server is so big that it needs to be ran professionally, smoothly and like a business. If I were to just hire any dev and have them work for free it gives me no real entitlement to check up on work they’re doing, telling them I think things they are doing are wrong etc. It is basically rude to complain when someone is spending their free time for nothing to help you. However if I am paying people then there is no issue checking progress and (if needs be) talking about activity. These are just not things which can really come from free developers.</p>
<p>I also really see any issue with profiting from the server. The majority of our player base is behind us. I have been as open and as transparent about everything from day 1. Once the server profit rises (which I expect it will once multi-world is released and clan system are automated and prices reduced) what I am able to pay towards developers and re-invest in the server will increase, obviously my profit will also increase in line with this but I see no problem with me being rewarded for the time I devote to this project.</p>
<p>Anyway, you might disagree and you might think that I am an evil money hungry bastard. That’s totally up to you but I ask that we get as much of this out of the way in this thread now as we can so that once I remake the topic the squabbling will be done. I am not changing the way the server is run, it is my server and quite frankly I will run it how I choose to. If you or other people don’t want to play it that is totally your prerogative but I ask that you are at the very least respectful and don’t act like idiots/douches for literally no reason…</p>

        <p>This is a genuine question to not just this server but many servers who talk about advertising.</p>
<p>Is it worth advertising a server that 100s of people play? wouldnt jagex make more of an effort to shut it down?</p>

Your ex-staff. Just thought I’d comment on how ex-staff still have power. Corrupt power system sounds too strong, what would you call it?<br>
Logically this is how it should work power wise:<br>
Owners/admins w.e. you want to call it, staffing i.e. moderators power divided into the appropriate sectors<br>
Then you have people who think they have power due to popularity i.e. veterans and so on.<br>
What category do you fall into/do you think I’m missing a category?</p>
<p>Ontopic: you should udpate the OP so you can show people the progress your making; just a suggestion.</p>
