    <title>RSCEmulation&#39;s Highscores</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rscemulations-highscores/390995</link>
    <description>I done the majority of this months ago but never got around to implementing it properly. It&#39;s a cache based highscores system that updates itself automatically every 3 hours or so. It takes one simple look-up query (no joins what-so-ever) per page to display everything you see in the video which means the query itself runs at something like 0.1 seconds compared to the old highscores that required several joins to function properly and took over 3 seconds in some cases.

The best feature in my opinion is the ability to see how a specific user ranks in each skill just like you can on the real RuneScape&#39;s highscores. If you then click onto a skill that the user is ranked in it goes directly to that position in the highscores table so you can see exactly how far away you are from progressing through the ranks. I think this provides a decent incentive for skillers which never used to be there.

There&#39;s still a lot left to do before I&#39;m going to release it though. I want to add some more features like a &#39;friend-only highscores&#39; (only loads players that you have befriended on any of your characters attached to your website account) as well as being able to compare your stats/rank/XP to any other character in-game simply by typing their username. If you rank higher in a skill a green upwards pointing arrow will show between the two skill lists and if they rank higher a red downwards arrow will show instead.

However, the main reason for doing this was to make the site more efficient. It&#39;s really not a good idea having queries take over 3 seconds to execute on a page that can be refreshed by anyone rapidly (even if it doesn&#39;t directly affect the game server itself). 

I also want to add a &#39;live character viewer&#39; using the web &lt;&gt; game system which will allow you to see the player online gaining XP (providing the user hasn&#39;t hidden their stats from the highscores). It will automatically update on the website via AJAX the second the player gains XP in-game (not touching the database) so other players can analyse their progress. It also enables us to be able to do things such as awards for the most XP gained in an hour, day, week, etc.

Credit goes to Zorian for the character sprite on the character page (I really like this feature).

Any suggestions/feedback welcome providing it&#39;s constructive.</description>
