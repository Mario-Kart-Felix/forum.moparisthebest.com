    <description>Im using darkquest. Whenever a normal player logs off from ingame, it causes the whole server to shut down. The LS then displays this message:

Uploaded with [URL=http://imageshack.us]ImageShack.us[/URL]

This only happens with normal players. Moderators and Admins are not affected by this.

Heres my database setup for rscd_players_cache:

Any help is appreciated thanks!

Also, on another note:

My website decodes users&#39; passwords with MD5, however my server reads it as SHA-1. How do I make the website translate into sha-1 instead of md5?</description>

<p>tbh, darkquest needs a lot of work to be even worth using, i found. i guess nobody who was part of that project decided to actually test it properly. it’s a good server but theres just a lot of little things here and there that need fixing. at least from the revision that prsc took.</p>
