[End Note]:

Because I was in need of an Agility script and enoyhs&#39;s doesn&#39;t seem to work even converted to R2, I decided to make my own.  70%&#39;ish of the object-handling here was used from enoyhs&#39;s script, so think of this as an updated and much improved version of his.  The longest part of the script that I worked on the most was probably the on-screen logo.  I was doing quite a bit of experimenting with it (as well as a dynamic form, but that a failure in the end...:() and it finally turned out how I had planned.

Because I&#39;m beyond 75 Agility myself, I didn&#39;t have the chance to test the eating procedures, but they&#39;ve yet fail my in my other scripts.  If someone would like to give them a go, I&#39;d much appreciate that.  Anywho, enjoy the script, post your progress reports, and be sure to report bugs in the script.
