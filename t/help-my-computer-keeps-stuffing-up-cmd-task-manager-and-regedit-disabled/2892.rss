    <title>Help my computer keeps stuffing up (CMD, Task manager and Regedit disabled)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-my-computer-keeps-stuffing-up-cmd-task-manager-and-regedit-disabled/2892</link>
    <description>Ok ive had this problem about 4 months now and its really anoying. Basically i keep getting an error when i try to run aryan or any other cmd program, task manager or regedit wont work either. Ive tried reinstalling widows with 3 different versions and it still keeps hapening. I think that its WGA (windows genuine activation tool) that keeps disabling it as each time i find records of it somewhere on my pc. Any help getting rid of it would be greatly apreciated, ive even tried norton but nothing came up.</description>
