    <title>MVP for Java</title>

    <description>Hi,

A while ago I started on a little project to make my Swing user interfaces a little cleaner.
As a result I started working on a library that offers (fairly) easy use of the MVP design pattern for Swing.
I&#39;m hoping to expand it to something more with useful features and an accompanying widget library that abstracts some of the filthy stuff in Swing.

I created a SVN repository on google code where I will be putting the changes into and I figured I might aswell post it here because it may be useful for someone.
It&#39;s really rough right now but here goes; You can find the project at http://code.google.com/p/auroralibs-mvp/

Please post any suggestions or &quot;weird things&quot; you might see around, I do want to improve it as much as I can but i&#39;m pretty sure i&#39;ll be missing some things from time to time.</description>
