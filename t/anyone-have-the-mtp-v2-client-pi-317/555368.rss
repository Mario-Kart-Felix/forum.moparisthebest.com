    <title>Anyone have the MTP v2 client? PI 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-have-the-mtp-v2-client-pi-317/555368</link>
    <description>Hello all!

Does anyone have a client that went with[b] MTP v2 remake[/b]? or anything that would work well with it? I decided since I&#39;m a comp sci major I wanted to go back and mess with that server a little, and I can&#39;t seem to find a client that works well with it.

Thanks</description>
