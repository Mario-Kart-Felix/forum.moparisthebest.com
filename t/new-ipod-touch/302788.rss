    <title>New IPod Touch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-ipod-touch/302788</link>
    <description>What does everyone think about the 64GB IPod touch, with 3.0.1 firmware?

Personally i think it&#39;s a rip off for the other 8,32,64GB models because they charge quite a lot more, all they really did was add new firmware, which you could do on your other ipod touch through itunes for about $10.

[center][u][b]Pros[/b][/u][/center]

You listen to music, and now your music listens to you. The new 32GB and 64GB iPod touch models feature Voice Control. So you can tell iPod touch to play songs from a specific playlist or artist. Or speak simple commands such as “shuffle,” “pause,” and “next song.” You can even ask for the name of the track that’s currently playing (and hear iPod touch answer you). 

Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic 
The new 32GB and 64GB iPod touch models come with the Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic, which are perfect for using the Voice Memos app and Voice Control.

Your very own private screening awaits you on iPod touch. Watch the latest film release or an episode of your favourite sitcom anytime you want. Store up to 80 hours of video and get up to 6 hours of video playback time on the new iPod touch.


[center][u][b]Cons[/b][/u][/center]

The Price differences are quite heavy considering that you could get an IPhone 32GB for the price of the IPod Touch 32GB/64GB.

Prices right now

8GB model is $219 USD.

32GB model is $329 USD.

64GB is [u][b]$429 USD.[/b][/u]

Apple doesn&#39;t sell 16GB Newer IPod Touch models.



In the end you win and lose, but i would still rather upgrade to an IPhone 3GS and grab myself a 32GB model.
