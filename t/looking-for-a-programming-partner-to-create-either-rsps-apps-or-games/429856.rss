    <title>Looking for a programming partner! To create either RSPS, apps, or games</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-programming-partner-to-create-either-rsps-apps-or-games/429856</link>
    <description>Hi! The name is [b]Aaron[/b]. I am [b]18[/b] years of age and am teaching myself Java Programming.  Yes you can look at my rep and say I am a &quot;noob&quot; or a novice but actually I have been on moparscape for awhile almost 4 years.  I haven&#39;t had much ambition to go out on forums and look for a partner to create a game or an app and maybe even make a little money while doing so.  Well enough about me.. I would like to know about you and if you&#39;re interested.  
I am looking for someone who is dedicated and knows a little about programming. You don&#39;t have to be an expert because I am far from it.  Java is the recommended language although others are just fine.
[u][b]Please POST a short resume:[/b][/u]

Name:

Age:

Type of Programming Language:

Experience:

Thank you for your time. Looking for many responses!! (:

Also [b]F.Y.I. [/b]I really want someone who won&#39;t back out and has some time of contact reference such as Skype/Facebook, etc.
[b]Email[/b] me at [u][size=14pt]aaron.mier@gmail.com[/size][/u]</description>
