<p>Pretty sure that’s like the only topic besides moparscape ones that I’ve locked in this section, the majority of them were in questions. Anyhow I think you guys just are used to me yet, I’ll try to give more warnings and less locks, but remember I was selected for a reason, to help out. Sorry if I’ve pissed anyone else off.</p>

I suppose this should be locked because I can see a flame war developing. MITB shows no signs of closing down, so until this topic is neccessary there is no need for this, if you would like to have a serious discussion about this goto the Discussions and Debates section.<br>
