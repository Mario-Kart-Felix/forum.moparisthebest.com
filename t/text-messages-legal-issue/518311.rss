    <title>Text messages - legal issue?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/text-messages-legal-issue/518311</link>
    <description>Sup guys, no hate what I do with my life is my choice thanks. 

Here&#39;s the situation, I sell weed.
This kid who I&#39;ve sold to in the past, wanted to buy some from me.. so he said. Turns out, he&#39;s just trying to jump me and take off with my shit lmao. 
I&#39;m almost 100% positive he will attempt to contact the police and give them the following information, would it be enough to charge me with a crime? He has no physical evidence that I sell other than these messages..

              <p>as said previously, i would not worry about getting in trouble for the messages themselves. just do not get lured into meeting him with the product anywhere on you (including your vehicle). here’s an idea,</p>
<p>if you know you are going to be selling to him, tell him the location an hour before you do it and already be there. hide the product somewhere before hand so even if he does try to get you into trouble, you do not actually have it on you - it’s secured somewhere else. if the police do show up, let them do what they will and just get it the next day. this would also help if he tries to threaten you physically and steal it from you.</p>
<p>as for facebook, it is possible for them to receive a subpoena for chat records from your DA. it happens often in the US. keep any confidential communications off of facebook. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

A very good friend of mines got caught with 163kg of weed in his garage, the driver dropped it off there stupidly instead of where it was meant to be going. He done a good amount of years for that, now he gets a new phone every week (just a £15 shitty one) for all his dealing things, along with a new SIM card, every week he will go drive around and break the phone into pieces, and then after the phone is broken up break the SIM card into 6 different parts and just throw them out the windows at different times. That’s how he avoids it while using mobiles, anyway. A couple ounces isn’t really enough to get a warrant with over here, not sure about over in the US but you should be fine, just be <span class="bbcode-b">very</span> careful from now on. And keep shit like that off Facebook.<br>

<p>163kg = 5749.66oz, 1oz in UK is about £200 which makes that £1,149,800… why does the article only say</p>

<p>EDIT: Ohh it was resin</p>

Here’s the story on the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/8593403.stm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">BBC News</a> website.</p>
