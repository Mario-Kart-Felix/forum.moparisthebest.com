              <p>idk if this helps sometimes i see people saying it might help or might not go to start and go to allow programs through fire wall an add new one the port id is 43594 the reg standerd for rsps and your ip address for your server and then download utorrent and no-ip and then go to utorrent and make the port on it same as for rsps and save it then open utorrent then server then client. sometimes the server dont open cause the server is reading a server already online cause of the utorrent just keep trying tell it opens. goodluck.</p>
