    <description>Hey guys ive googled it and went through the sorted tutorials and didnt find anything.
Here is my code for Gargoyle drops.
[code]			//gargoyle
			{1611, 526, 1, 0}, {1611, 4129, 1, 3}, {1611, 995, 1 + Misc.random(220), 5}, {1611, 1619, 1, 3}, {1611, 1621, 1, 5}, {1611, 1623, 1, 5}, {1611, 1617, 1, 3}, {1611, 2359, 3, 3}, 
			{1611, 830, 5, 5}, {1611, 2353, 3, 5}, {1611, 4101, 1, 3}, {1611, 560, 5, 8}, {1611, 4153, 1, 3}, {1611, 1462, 1, 4}, {1611, 1247, 1, 5}, {1611, 1365, 1, 9}, 
			{1611, 562, 15, 7}, {1611, 554, 75, 10}, {1611, 985, 1, 2}, {1611, 7937, 35, 8}, {1611, 1311, 1, 9}, {1611, 1734, 20, 10}, {1611, 2357, 1, 9}, {1611, 2366, 1, 2}, {1611, 1163, 1, 2}, {1611, 1353, 1, 9}, {1611, 1249, 1, 3},
			[/code]

I am making a 2006 Version of Runescape and have done 100% drops for about 30% of the NPCs.

When i kill the gargoyle it will drop like 10 different things... How to i make it drop only one thing as the Granite Maul [code]{1611, 4153, 1, 3},[/code]
Is it because the ratios are to high and thats the only way to do it or is there a method that can be constructed in order to do it?</description>
