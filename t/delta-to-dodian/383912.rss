    <title>Delta to Dodian?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-to-dodian/383912</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been looking around, and haven&#39;t seen a single dodian being hosted so I&#39;m coding one from the blank Devolution that was released. I&#39;ve gotten off to a very good start, I&#39;ve finished every NPC at home except for some shops I wish to add. 

All I wish to know is if making shops in Dodian is exactly the same as it is in delta? (With the wanneshop, and only having to edit NPCHandler, Autospawn, Item.CFG (for prices) and Shops.CFG)?</description>
