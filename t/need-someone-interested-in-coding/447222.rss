    <description>I got myself the FallenPk source, and I had myself a coder because I host. But when I went to the beach and came back he disappeared lol. Well anyway Im looking for someone to code and possibly teach me in the process, like possibly over teamviewer or we  could use Dropbox. Im ready to get the server underway for whoever may be interested in helping let me know, My skype name is &quot;bgonzalez31&quot; if you want to add me feel free. Thanks guys.</description>
