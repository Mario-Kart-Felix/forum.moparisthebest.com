    <title>Scammed by Gold4RS? DONT TRUST THEM!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/scammed-by-gold4rs-dont-trust-them/414501</link>
    <description>Hey mopar community,
Well i have gotten ultimately bored of Real Runescape and decided to move back to private server&#39;s permanently, so i though i would sell my account on Runescape. I came across Gold4RS and thought, they look professional enough, so i proceeded to the sell forum, i agreed to sell them a level 121 with full torva, dragon, sara, zammy and a party hat for 190$ so i proceeded to give the lady my password, and change the email on the account for her. She told me i can claim my money on September 11Th 2011, so i come back yesterday, saying i would like to claim my money. The lady in the chat says: &quot;We cannot login- you recovered it- we aren&#39;t going to pay you, and disconnected the chat, Now i would of let it go if she would have tried to figure something out, but she rudely disconnected...  this meant something was up. so i continued to bother them for about 2 hours after that, spoke to managment and they said they never change the email... so i said  well when i was selling it to the company the lady told me to change the email... the manager said well i am sorry but it is not our fault we cannot login and disconnected the chat.. again. so i have lost my account, just to all mopar&#39;rs please do not fall victim to this scam. Oh and i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions as to what i should do?

Best regards,
~Justin</description>
