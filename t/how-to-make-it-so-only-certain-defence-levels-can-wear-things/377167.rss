    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-it-so-only-certain-defence-levels-can-wear-things/377167</link>
    <description>On my server (MTPV2 Sourced [PI])   I am having problems...  I have people with like 1 defence, and their wearing statius and vesta and stuff. What I need to know, is how to make is so you need like 80 defence to wear statius. I am also having problems with chaotics, people are 1 attack wearing c mauls and basicly just making it un-fair for the rest of the pure community :(. PLEASE HELP</description>
