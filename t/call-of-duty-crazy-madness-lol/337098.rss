    <description>Ok, just pointing out the fact that ActiVision is GAY**S they publish games by companies the support. Such as infinityWard better known as MW2... *applause for mw2* And well activision just fired the infinityward president and company manager because once they signed a contract with legal rights to sell MW2 and get big profits also, they didnt need the &quot;stupid&quot; infinity ward pres and manager. So they fired them and stole thier game. GAYYYYY!!! Now the president and manager are sueing activision for mills. GL activision. Try to fire the creators of such a beastly game. I should go get my Ak-47 lol.</description>
