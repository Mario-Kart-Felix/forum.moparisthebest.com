    <title>Berky-Scape Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/berky-scape-issue/327554</link>
    <description>Has anyone found a way to fix this HUGE bug on Berky-Scape.  The bug is, when you trade, the interfaces become messed up, and no one can offer anything... it doesn&#39;t recognize the inventory as an interface.



If anyone has found a solution to this, let me know - I&#39;ve tried everything :-(.</description>
