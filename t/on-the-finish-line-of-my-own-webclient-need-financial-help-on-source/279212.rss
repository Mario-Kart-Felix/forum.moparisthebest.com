    <description>I got an little thing i dislike on my client: when somebody (non-admin) dies there spawns a npc (&quot;death&quot;) in the spot it died i was just wondering how to make it so that it has a timer till it dissapperas or do i have to put it to a auto-restarter so it dissappears every time the server refreshes...?You know, it  will be pretty annoying to have about 100 deaths in my PK-Boxes...

Thank you for atleast reading and Über thanks for commenting!</description>
