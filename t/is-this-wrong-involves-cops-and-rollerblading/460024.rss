    <title>Is this wrong? (Involves cops and rollerblading)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-this-wrong-involves-cops-and-rollerblading/460024</link>
    <description>So, today... I was street blading... And going around everywhere in town, I go to the local library and start rollerblading over the ledges and crap (About a 4 foot gap off of two ledges I jump with like 5 other rollerbladers...) So I go and we&#39;re just sitting down for now, cops come over there (About my 5th warning to take them off) and tell me to &quot;Take them god damn skates off or I will kick you out of this town&quot;...

That&#39;s not the bad part... I flipped him off and he came running after me, pushed me on the cement and throws my blades on the cement and breaks my 300 fucking dollar pair of blades?! -..-</description>

Does it matter if it was awesome? You were told 5(?) times to take them off, BY A POLICE OFFICER, and you didn’t do it. Then you flipped him off, what did you expect? It’s not illegal to flip people off, but still.</p>
<p>PS - Librarians don’t own the state library, and are just employees. Their views don’t represent that of the people who actually own the library. I don’t know without doing some research as to whether or not rollerblading isn’t allowed at that library, but a lot of the time it isn’t (including skateboarding and such), and if that’s the case you deserved what you got. Either way you should have respected the police officer and left the premises, I’m sure there are other places you can rollerblade.<br>

<p>NO where to rollerblade at but there was a sign there and it only said “No skateboarding” We even asked a cop was it okay to rollerblade there and she said yes! -.- … I’m going to roll a blunt, so fuck all this mess…[/quote]Well I’m going to be blunt here (pun intended), and it’s obvious that you are just trying to justify being a jerk… here’s why:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On trivial matters, you can’t take one cops view and think another cop is going to follow the exact same thing. Skateboarding and rollerblading are similar, so it makes sense they may have different views on the matter, depending on how bad a mood they are in or how disruptive you are being (and just from this post you seem like a disruptive person). If you really want to roller blade there, do it when the cop that says its OK is on duty?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if one cop said it was ok, it must’ve been clear after you got warnings that this cop didn’t agree, so you should have stopped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t flip cops off, or any authority figure. It makes you look like an ass. If you have a complaint or concern take it to a higher authority.</p>
</li>

              <p>Does it matter if it was awesome? You were told 5(?) times to take them off, BY A POLICE OFFICER, and you didn’t do it. Then you flipped him off, what did you expect? It’s not illegal to flip people off, but still.</p>
<p>PS - Librarians don’t own the state library, and are just employees. Their views don’t represent that of the people who actually own the library. I don’t know without doing some research as to whether or not rollerblading isn’t allowed at that library, but a lot of the time it isn’t (including skateboarding and such), and if that’s the case you deserved what you got. Either way you should have respected the police officer and left the premises, I’m sure there are other places you can rollerblade.</p>

              <p>So, today… I was street blading… And going around everywhere in town, I go to the local library and start rollerblading over the ledges and crap (About a 4 foot gap off of two ledges I jump with like 5 other rollerbladers…) So I go and we’re just sitting down for now, cops come over there (About my 5th warning to take them off) and tell me to “Take them god damn skates off or I will kick you out of this town”…</p>
<p>That’s not the bad part… I flipped him off and he came running after me, pushed me on the cement and throws my blades on the cement and breaks my 300 fucking dollar pair of blades?! -…-</p>
