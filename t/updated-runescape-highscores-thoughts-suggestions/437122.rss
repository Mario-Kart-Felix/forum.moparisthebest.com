    <title>Updated Runescape Highscores? Thoughts / Suggestions?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/updated-runescape-highscores-thoughts-suggestions/437122</link>
    <description>With private servers, more and more are wanting to be like real Runescape, the highscores however are very outdated and mostly don&#39;t work for new and advanced servers. I was thinking of creating a highscores that is almost identical to the current one that runescape has located at, http://services.runescape.com/m=hiscore/heroes.ws .. 

Obviously i would have to alter some things and change things here and there to make it work, let me know what your thoughts are on this project and if you think i should continue to do it. In the past i have released new themes for previous highscores to the moparscape community, this project may take a couple days but the end result would be really nice, almost identical to runescape&#39;s highscores, and easy to use, along with it being fully customizable. 

Let me know your thoughts on this project, if i get enough positive feedback and people seem to want this, i&#39;ll work on it and try to have it released by this Saturday.
