There is no reason to use a switch statement and check the players rights every single time, and there was no point in using a for loop and iterating through the max players list 3 times. A <a href="http://www.leepoint.net/notes-java/flow/loops/foreach.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">for-each loop</a> is a much more simplified version of a for loop.</p>
<p><code>
private void message() {
	String[] allowed = { "mopar", "adam", "ryley", "cuz we both sexy"};
	for (Player player : PlayerHandler.players) {
	    if (player != null) {
		((Client) player).sendMessage(!disconnected ? Misc.formatPlayerName(allowed[player.playerRights].toLowerCase()) + " has logged in." 
								: Misc.formatPlayerName(allowed[player.playerRights].toLowerCase()) + " has logged out.");
	    }
	}
    }</code></p>
<p>Use that in the login/logout voids.</p>
