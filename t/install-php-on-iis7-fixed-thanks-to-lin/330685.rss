    <title>Install PHP on IIS7? [Fixed thanks to Lin]</title>

    <description>[s]Hi everyone. Sorry I&#39;ve been asking so many questions lately, I have no one else to turn to and the users of MoparScape seem to know the answers to my questions. I&#39;ve used multiple tutorials on setting up and installing PHP X.X.X on IIS7, but when I download the PHP zip file, there are no files called php-recommended.ini and I can&#39;t find any programs on Windows 7 called FastCGI. Please help me install the latest PHP on Windows 7 for IIS7. It&#39;s becoming a real struggle for me and I&#39;m getting really frustrated with all this. :/[/s]
Fixed! Thanks Lin! :)</description>

<p>I understand this problem is fixed, but why on earth are you using IIS when it’s the most horrible web server ever. As I have mentioned before just download and install wamp and you will have no problems whatsoever because it is all gui based and so easy to use. You just run it, thing stick files in the designated folder(usually c:/wamp/www) and you’re ready to go!</p>
<p>I should also mention that you wamp contains apache, mysql and php so there’s no need to manually install stuff like php manually like you are doing now.</p>

<p>I took your advice into consideration and downloaded+installed wamp, and stopped my server on IIS7, but when I click on Start All Services, it doesn’t do anything. Do I need to get Apache? Because I uninstalled it a day or two or three ago.<br>

<p>What exactly do you mean, it doesn’t do anything?  Did you visit localhost in your browser?[/quote]<br>
It doesn’t say that anything is running. I still says all services are offline. And localhost redirects me to <a href="http://www.localhost.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.localhost.com</a></p>
