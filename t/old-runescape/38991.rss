    <title>Old Runescape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/old-runescape/38991</link>
    <description>So here it is( the report I found- truly gives you a different point of view at things) this thing isn&#39;t too recent, so don&#39;t start tellin me its ot of date...


part 1:

I can&#39;t help but feel nothing but nostalgia when I see RuneScape classic. I yearn for the days of old, when things were much simpler than they are now. I miss getting up on saturday morning, grabbing my bowl of cereal, and hopping on RuneScape. This is the story of how i came to be.

Me and my brothers were at the local library in our town one day, and we were looking for games to play. We happened upon a certain website, and looked under the adventure section, and found runescape. i had been looking for months for a good online rpg that was free to play, so this really appealed to me.

I started out with the character named SEIRVED86. I, of course, chose to be a warrior.

You see, back in those days, the great mages who allowed people into ***leinor would give them certain professions.

A warrior would start int his land with a short sword made of bronze, and a weak wooden shield. His combat stats were 3, and his hitpoints was 12.

A mage would start with a blue wizard hat, and a staff. His magic would be 10.

A miner would start with a pickaxe, and his mining would be 10.

An adventurer would start with a hatchet and a tinderbox, and his cooking, woodcutting, and firemaking would be 2, as well as his combat stats.

A ranger would start with 10 arrows, and a shortbow. his ranging would be 10.

A necromancer would be the same as a mage, but with a black wizards hat.
*Jagex did away with necromancing, because there were too many bugs with the demons being cast into this land. It will probably be back soon though.*

That world was much smaller back then, only one server. It was a good time.

I remember one incident when I was new, happened in lumbridge. I was walking outside of the city. By the way, Lumbridge was the safe zone, and nobody could be hurt there.

Part 2:

All of a sudden, a man with full bronze plate walks up to me.

&quot;hey man, follow me!&quot; he says.

&quot;oooo okay&quot;

He leads me out of lumbridge, and next thing I know, he kills me! I was so mad.

It was then, that I decided I wanted no part of this realm, and left.

In April of 2001, I decided to come back again. However, I had forgotten my secret word to get in through the gates of RuneScape, so I had to make a new alias for myself. This time, he is known as J D 86.

A few things about RuneScape that people do not know:

Originally there was no friends list. I remember when they added the friendslist, everyone was so happy! However you did not really need a friends list, because the world was small enough and tere were so few people that everyone recognized each other.

There were no prayers. Prayers like Steel Skin were originally spells that you cast on yourself.

In restless ghost, you can steal the skull and drop it in lumbridge and it would turn into a skeleton. Then tha tskeleton would attack players, and they&#39;d die and you&#39;d get their stuff

There was once a rather high level player (well at that time he was anywyas) who died near lumbridge. He lost all his stuff, because at that time you had no bank, an dyou did not keep your three best items. He dropped full steel with the kite shield, which was the best armor at that time, under mithril. When more than one person stood on a pile, a bug would not allow anybody to pick up anything. So about 30 people stood on that pile for hours, arguing that somebody had to get off of it. It was the funniest thing i still have seen to this day.

On the original forums, a n00b posted that he was fighting a chicken, and a &quot;green blob thing&quot; flew at his chicken, and his chicken logged out. Everyone laughed, because that green blob thing was an arrow, and his chicken die\

Part 3:

You started out in the game, and you could Choose to be a pker or not.


I chose non-pk.

You could then switch to pk, then back again. But after that, you could not switch anymore. Lumby was the safe zone, and nobody could attack there.

I remember visiting port sarim, and upon examing the boats there, i read &quot;coming soon-karamja island&quot;.

All amulets looked like a gold amulet when you wore them.

All swords, short swords, daggers, scimitars, two handers looked like long sword when you wear them.

Ah, the colored capes. I remember waking up one morning in I think it was June of &#39;01, and jagex said theres colored capes!!! At that time, you could only have a red cape, blue cape, or black cape. Blue cape meant you were in the champions guild, which was a great achievement. I went to Draynor village, and there was a crowd of ppl hording around aggie, and since only one person could talk to an npc at a time, many people were selling the colored capes for loads of cash. Green cape, Purple cape, Orange cape, and yellow cape were huge hits. Especially Yellow. I liked the green one though.

A lot of players find it nerving how easy RS2 is. I remember being real near carpal tunnel from minin coal in barbarian village, and walk away at night with only 50 coal. Now, i can get 300 in no time, and theres no damage to the hand. Plus they have things like tears of guthix that r*** peoples levels in no time.

I remember running with my brother away from pkers. How did we lose them? Well its easy. We went to the center of Varrock square, hid amongst the crowd, and they never found us. All we saw was &quot;Ark! Ark! where ar eyou ark? come here ark we have free armor!!&quot; (ark was short for my brothers account name)

If you had diamond amulet, you were amongst the richest of the richest. The same with Adamant kite. Actually, full adamantite for that matter.

Best food in the game: Apple pie.
Fishing? no
Agility? no
herb

Part 4:

There was only one type of arrow. Many players took advantage of this, and created ranger accounts just for the sake of getting free arrows.

Few types of armor: Plate mail, leather armor, wizards robes. One type of boot and glove, leather. No mauls, whips, warhammers, throwing knives. Only two types of range weapon: crossbow, and long and shortbow.

You could trade quest items back then. I beat shield of Arrav because somebody sold me the kings certificate, and i gave it to him, and got 200gp (or higher, dont remember) and beat the quest without ever doing it. I also bought silverlight because i couldnt figure out the puzzles to get it. and i bought the oil can too for ernest the chicken.

if you had 10kgp, you were rich.

No &quot;bank notes&quot;. If you wanted to trade large quantities, you had to either trust the other person, or just sell 20 something coal for its base price. No bulk. They later created certificates to ease this problem, but once again it created a problem in the wrist.

Before lesser demons, the only demon in the game was in wizard tower. People coud range it, but that was about it.

No dragons.

[s]slayer
construction
runecrafting
farming[/s]
quests? about 10.

Karamja? no
the whole world west of falador? no
the whole world east of varrock? no
al kharid? not at the beginning, however they did release it very shortly after.

Know your roots!!!

only potion was strenght potion, which you got for limpwurt root and red spiders eggs. only way to obtain was fighting hobgoblins, which many people died from, including me, because ppl were real low level. red spiders eggs you had to face moss giants, which were even worse.

black armor? just plate legs and helm. no weapons, shields, nothing.

Wilderness? no
many people were upset with the wilderness. They didnt like how there was one specific area to pk in. I still to this day dont like it.

Gosh, what else...

Part 5:

I remember the server status. I mentioned it earlier, but i&#39;ll explain it further. If i remember right, it showed the highest in the stats of combat (hitpoints) mining, smithing, ranging, mage, and combat level. I could be wrong, it was so long ago. I used to say to myself &quot;i&#39;m gonna be on the server stats one day!&quot;. If you made it onto the server stats, you were instantly famous, because everyone who played the game saw ur name, what server you were on (after they created more than just one server, at that time there were tree, mid &#39;01 I think).

Shortly before members was introduced, they got rid of the original forums, where all you needed was a runescape account. They then added highscore lists, but it wasnt like it is today. It was just a list, updated hourly, that showed who was waht, up to top 2000 i believe. I was on it for herblaw (yes it was called herblaw) for about a month when that skill was first released.

The stats didnt at first show how much experience you needed to level. But a person knew, because after a while you&#39;d catch on to how much goblins you needed to fight, or how many dwarves, or monks, or how many bones you needed to bury, so you had a feeling of when you were going to level up. It even made it more surprising, and exciting... because you didnt know when you were going to level up.

I&#39;ve got so much to tell, its gonna be hard to fit it all in.

I think i talked about rune armor earlier, right?

Well shortly after that release, the gates of hell opened, and lesser demons started invading this land. They dropped a new helmet that was never seen before, and very prized among people: The Rune Medium Helmet. Boy oh boy was it a status symbol. I used to drool over having one, however i was never lucky enough to get one. Until they went down to about 20k and i bought one.

Part 6:

Shortly thereafter, Greater demons started invading, and they dropped Rune Large helmets. These were even better. A true status symbol!

Andrew was in Falador park later wearing full rune, including plate mail. this was not seen before, because the best was rune chain mail, much like dragon chain is the best now (some might argue with that). He was showing it off to everyone, everyones like &quot;zomg w0w r00n plate&quot;

Then, the mightiest of quests was introduced:

DRAGON SLAYER!!!!!!!

That was a tough one, esecially for me, who had just reached level 50. But i wanted that rune plate mail so badly, i couldnt take it any longer, i had to do that quest.

I died three times. We didnt have all the advantages people do now... they say &quot;oh dragon slayer is so easy.&quot; let me tell you waht, if you try to do it in full mith, with adamant battle axe (rune battle axe was far too expensive, only player smiths could do it, and only bluerose had high enough.) see how long you last. I think fishing had just come out too, so a buddy of mine gave me a few swordfish, but other than that i had stupid food like redberry pie or something. dont remember. It was a toughy though, and if you wore rune plate, it meant something. Unlike today.

I remember seeing some re3ally high level player who doesnt play anymore wearing a rune square shield, about a week after rune came out. I dont remember his name, but it had something to do with penguins. Man, this guy was rich. he must have been blueroses friend or something. Rune shield was even higher status symbol.

Still the party hats tho.. .man oh man I had 20!!! can you believe it??? and i sold them. How dumb of me. I had 8 easter eggs some guy gave to me for a sapphire amulet. I ate them. W0w!!!! wtf was i dumb.


Black hole eh? well, in dwarven mines, there was the black hole experience. Instead of being banned, if you broke the rules you&#39;d log into nothing but blackness, and your stats would slowly

[br][size=1]Posted on: December 24, 2006, 03:31:04 PM[/size][hr]part 7:

Your stats would slowly decrease.

If you didnt break the rule, you could pay to see waht its like. The dwarf would hand you a disc of returning, which i later dropped to make bank space.

I drank my half full jug of wine.

I&#39;m dumb if only i woulda known...

Theres still much more to go... i&#39;m almost to members, but It will have to wait. i&#39;m at work an di have lots to do.

I am one of the oldest players, however my account isnt. Between &#39;03 and &#39;05 I took really long breaks... months at a time. I wasnt around when slayer was introduced and same with farming... i mised out on scythes, ruber chicken, bunny ears. But I do have lots of stories from before that.

Lets see...

The log in screen of runescape classic did not have picture of the landscape, it was just a black screen with the runecape logo, you know the one with the sword, then runescape etched in stones.

There were two buttons: Login, and create new. You didnt have to go through the website, which i think going through the websitre is a good idea. None of this newbie island. One thing us oldies are proud of is we learned everytying on our own, and it was tougher doing it. no newbie island, no &quot;cook x&quot;.

Btw, there was only one type of arrow.


zomg!!! one type of arrow you say?

It looked like a little stump, with red feather, and gray head. They really looked funny compared to how they look now, or shall isay once they introduced multiple metal arrows into rsc.

When blood runes came out, people had a hard time with scamming of those. Some people are color blind, and they looked jsut like water runes, but red. So jagex shifted the icon on the blood rune to the right a little. the same was happening with Dragon longs and Dragon baxes... They looked like the normal bronze variants.

I admit, i got scammed with that once. The trade screen, the only thing you had ot do was to click a small check box that said accept, and the trade was done. Lots of scams that way.
They changed the design of d baxe and d long to look different. I think they should have kept those looks and moved them to rs2... they look pretty tough.

I remember a glitch in the game where when ever you typed something, no matter what it was, when you hit enter your character wouuld say &quot;cabbage!&quot;

So so so much more...

classic involved much more imagination, which i loved. Dont get me wrong, i still love rs2. I would have stuck with rsc however if it werent for the fact that rsc was gonna be not updated.

Oh you guys are gonna love this one. Its the story of the POH.


It was back in early &#39;02, i believe, and I was with a buddy of mine. We were fighting dark mages outside of varrock, and we get booted from server. When i went to main page, i saw that andrew was gonna release player owned houses. &quot;Sweet!&quot; i thought.

I logged back in, and went to varrock. There was a gate next to the new bank, on the east side of town. It was where that path is that leads north to the sawmill, or south to al kharid. I saw endless rows of houses. Then all of a sudden, i see &quot;selling house key, 5k!&quot;.

It was a person called POH agent. Hmmm... I saw this key, and it looked remarkably similar to the key from erneest the chicken, you know the one that gets you intot the closet.

I called him a scammer, and walked off. He just kept tryin to get me to buy it. Its a pity that people will take advantage of a situation like that.

What happened to the player owned houses you ask? stay tuned... i gotta get back to work.

you all might be wondering, &quot;tali, if you&#39;ve played so long, why are you only level 92, skill total 1343?&quot;

Well heres yiour answer.

I&#39;ve had three different accounts, plus multiple n00b accoutns over the years, one was a sabre. I&#39;ve taken loooong breaks, one of them being over a year long.

i&#39;ll have more stories later. If anybody has any questions, wants to talk anything, just add me, talibasa.

i&#39;m usualy on after 7, thats when i get home from work, tonite tho i have a date so i&#39;ll be on at night.

I remember when rs2 was introduced, i was kinda miffed by the fact that runite didnt glow anymore. I always saw rune armor as armor that was enchantaed with runes... tahts how it is in norse mythology... so thats why it glowed. but in rs2, its just blue.

rs2 is fun still though, albeit that theres i think way too mcuh to do... they pump out updates like nothin else you know? thats good, but sometimes its a little overwhelming.

anyways, about the POH&#39;s, we kept getting system mesages, &quot;player owned houses, 20 minutes!&quot;

Then it was 10

Then it was 5

Then it was one minute!

me and my friend were like oh boy~~ player owned houses~
they boot us off server, and guess what?

they&#39;re gone. instead, theres a path going to al kharid.

WTF?? lol

it ticked off the people who got scammed by POH agent even more.

I logged on once, and a bug amde it where the game wouldnt show any bodys, just p*** heads floating around. I had a screenshoto n my old computer, but its not on this one.

ALso, one time i logged into a member server back in rsc, and there was nothing but water where the land&#39;s supposed to be. I could see the buildings, the people moving, but there was just water and i couldnt move. And PLEASE note, that in rsc when you logged into f2p server in p2p lands, YES there would be nothing but water, but NO there wouldnt be any people, npcs, or buildings.

My first clan was called the Baptized Knights. It is a real old clan, but its not together anymore. hasnt been in like 4 years :)

My first friend on runescape was a homeless guy who played it at his local library. jsut about everybody played at a library it seemed like.

I have met such people as Alchemon and Zonghui, as well as a guy named Tram. He was a good buddy, he held up a legacy that i carry on to this day. I was a n00b, he helped me out by helpin me get rune items. Now, i help n00bs by doing the same. I am without cash all the time cause of it. I hope that those n00bs carry on that legacy when they can as well. I actually have one who is doing that now, i helped him when he was level 10, now hes almost 80.

ALl my characters i ever made, in order of when they were made:

SEIRVED86(lost pw)
JD86(lost pw)
J D 86(still use)
Talibasa(still use)
Qui Gon Jon (dressed in monks robes, and addy long... however after they made stat reqs for weapons, i didnt use him anymore)
Obi Jon Kenobi (same as before, but with rune long)

Uglugg (big guy with brown beard... the only thing i did was run around going &quot;ug want friend, you be ug&#39;s friend?&quot;

J D Sabre (part of the sabre clan, but i havent done anything for a while)

I was walking to the gates of RuneScape, and I was talking to one of its mages. He said, &quot;the runes of the world include, Mind runes, Body runes, and the four elemental runes: Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water.&quot;

Later on, he told me, &quot;I have created five new runes: &quot;Cosmic, Chaos, Nature, Death, and Law. Men can now teleport between his different establishments, and he may also enchant his jewelry to do his bidding. He may also turn normal items into gold coins.&quot;
( i may be wrong about that, but thas how i remember it).

Brian the axe seller in Port Sarim does sell the amost powerful weapon in the game, however, it is never stocked. It is the Adamantie battle axe.

I even once heard of a ** who went into black hole experience, ubt before he went in he dropped his disc of returning to see what happened. what a fool.

All animals in this land of Gielienor drop but one type of meat: Raw Meat. And you cant find the cooking apples in a tree, you can only find them in the cooking guild.

If you beat Gunthor the Brave, you are very very strong person.

Hans in lumbridge was at one time an attackable npc. He was level 0. Dont know how or why, but he was. I saw a n00b get killed by him once.

One thing i was really impress by when I first started rs2 was that the magic spells look like actual spells. Before, it was just a blue dot going across the screen, arrows was green dot.

There wasnt even a storyline to this game... just a bunch of skills, monsters, and quests thrown together.

When members was released, It included large additions of that city west of falador, White wolf mountain, and Catherby. It also introduced the Dragon longsword, the lost city quest, the dragon axe, and the hero&#39;s guild, along with a bundle of other quests. Camelot was also added, and many people scoffed at this because it ocmbined the legend with this game. I, however, just thought it was cool.

jHerblaw was also introduced into the game. For thel ongest time on rs herblaw was a stat, but nobody could level it up, because ther was no way to. But it showed on the stat menu. It was the same for fishing when it was introduced.

Later Fletching, along with Seers village, was introduced. THen came merlin&#39;s crystal, and people were able to have excalibur!

Finally Thieving was added, along with Ardougne, and a bit south of ardougne. Gnome village was there too. BY this time, RuneScape had really taken off, and RuneScape started to develop a storyline.

yeah shawn, banks were introduced because people were complaining about dieing and losing their stuff. I used to have escorts sometimes when i was going to buy new weapon or armor after gettin money saved up. THe first bank was the Western bank in Varrock. You oculd only deposit coins in it, in incrimints of (?) 500... if i remember right. THen they put one in Falador. Finally, banks accepted items, and they started springing up like wildfire.

Lol i saw some1 walking with a bronze full helm, and when i finally got one, i bragged so bad ot my brothers about it. Then the kid down the street walks up with full iron... iw as like you *** man.

lol i was 15 when i first started. I went throught lovin this game, hating it, lovein it, extremely hatin it, now i&#39;m addicted. Its funny.


J D 86: Wow, you beat delrith?
T***: Yeah, it wasnt too hard.
J D 86: he looks tough, did you almost die?
T***: of course not, my strength is 38 :)

I&#39;ve tried many other games, Dark age of Camelot, Diablo 2, lots of others... even counterstrike i dont think copmares to this game.


J D 86: I did it i beat the dragon! (the dragon didnt have a name back then, he was just caled the dragon. He was the only dragon.)

T***: good job jd

J D 86: zomg now i can get rune plate!

T***: you have 65k? (i tihnk that was the price, its changed since then.)

J D 86: aww man...

I still have more stories...


The wilderness was, although quite a bad idea in my opinion, actually fun to explore. I remember sitting at the iron bar respawn for days so i could get my smithing up.

The lava maze was quite fun. I remember going up there with my friend Tram, and I saw Alchemon and a couple of his lackies. Me, being the sissy i am, said &quot;oh sir alchemon, please dont attack me.&quot; Hes like, &quot;dont worry i cant even attack you, your too low level.&quot; Then he attacked Tram.

&quot;oops sorry tram&quot; alchemon said.

lol theyw ere friends!!!

My best friend in rs was famous with the most famous person in RuneScape!

how happy i was.

The first ime I ever had 100k gp was shortly after dragon long came out, and I had about 50k... tram lent me the other half. lol.

Now, I have D legs, D med, rune plate, glory ammy, and many dragon weapons. I&#39;m not the richest, but i&#39;ve come very far from wehre i was.

You know, jagex also had many other games. They had a mulitplayer castle game where you&#39;d go in and play litle minigames, and you could chat with others just like rs. They also had a multiplayer board game interface, much like yahoo. But rs took the cake, by far. There was also the bottomless pit. That was funny. It was more of an animation than agame. All you&#39;d do is fall down a bottomless pit, and it say random funny stuff and facts. quite amusing.

Anyone thought mining was bad, fishing was worse. mcuh much much worse. It took hours and hours to get a substantial amount of lobsters. Then they added the fatigue, and it made everythign worse. With rs2 though, it made things easier.

The main concern about the rs2 update among people was that it wouldnt be the same. They were right, but it wasnt so bad a change. Yes, somethings could use changing, but most of what is now is perfect.

It was at first planned to be just a graphical update, but with the same game engine and everything. But, when they were abuot to release the graphic update, they decided to totally re-write the whle game... for i think the fourth time. First was DeviousMUD, then was a deviousMUD beta that was out for a week, then was RuneScape**** en they re-wrote the engine in RSC before rs2. Not many people know about this. THey had the new engine as a beta for a small period of time. Then they released beta for rs2... everyone loved it. Most people did anyways.

Actually, just remembered one more thing:

This was when the wilderness had first been discovered.


I was traveling away from varrock, when behold, i came upon a settlement inhabited with fearsome barbarians. When they saw me, I ran for it. I ran north, as far as i could go... and I happened upon a town full of nothing but ghosts! Eeek!!! Maybe the barbarians used to live there, but the ghosts drove them out?

Before edgeville was made, it was known as the ghost town. THat dungeon was there, you know the one by the coffins, but there was no bank, no guard shack, and no wilderness... just an ocean. and on land was a bunch of empty crumbling buildings. When wildy was made, the ghost town turned into Edgeville. Huge improvement if i do say so myself.

Another one:

After finally settling the dispute between the goblin clans over which color their armor was, I was approached by two men. They said, If you can get this certain wine for me, i&#39;ll give you 5k coins. &quot;wow!&quot; i said to myself, and i followed them up to a strange tower on the mountain, just north of the goblins.
&quot;go on, get it!&quot; those men said, so i went ahead.

Just as i reached for the wine, an evil mage dressed in red lowered my stats and attacked me. right when i got done with him, the rest started attacking me. I tried to run for the door, but next thing i know, I have htis huge welt in my face! THey had shut the door on me! WHat was i gonna do? I had little itme to think about it. Every time i tried opening the door, they&#39;d close it again. But alas, it was no use. I died that day, and boy, was i mad.

That was a huge scam... trapping people in with the mages of zamorak in the chaos tower (or whatever its called). Because of this, Jagex removed the door fromt he tower that was once there.

I miss the feature wehre you could type this into the chatbox:

Tell (insertpersons name) wow thats cool zomg pl0x


That would send a private message ot the person. neat little shortcut i learned, cause when i would say tell me! it would say &quot;me isnt online&quot;

yeah… he didn’t say he wrote it, but he did imply it within the thread.  I just wanted credit to be given to the original author, that’s all <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>

<p>Thats fine you want credit but don’t expect it, he hasn’t been here since 2007. And he never implied that he wrote it, the very first thing he says is: “So here it is( [b]the report I found”[/quote]</p>
<p>but he still did not give credit to the owner!</p>
<p>gawd it’s an old argument w/e just enjoy the read.</p>

<p>J D 86: Wow, you beat delrith?<br>
T***: Yeah, it wasnt too hard.<br>
J D 86: he looks tough, did you almost die?<br>
T***: of course not, my strength is 38 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>T***: good job jd</p>
<p>J D 86: zomg now i can get rune plate!</p>
<p>T***: you have 65k? (i tihnk that was the price, its changed since then.)</p>
<p>J D 86: aww man…</p>

[/quote]</p>
<p>wtf man… this is my story I posted this on the RuneScape forums like two years ago.</p>
<p>none of this is bullshit, it’s all real.</p>
<p>but OMFG… you make it seem like you wrote this… you didn’t say you wrote it but you didn’t even give credit where credit is due.  I wrote it on the RuneScape forums two years ago under the name Talibasa.  J_D_86 was my old character.  Oh btw, the name T*** is really Tram… i couldn’t put his full name because they locked the thread when I did.</p>
<p>But please dude, give credit where credit is due.  Thanks.<br>

<p>yeah I agree… that what other person said is bs steel scimmy was never the best, and that wasn’t how you could dupe phats.  Even at the time when steel could have been the best phats weren’t around.[/quote]</p>
<p>I started playing in 2004.</p>
<p>I wish I had played back then, sounds like a really fun time.</p>
<p>To O M F G: Give J_D_86 his credits, he has proven that he is the owner and creator of this.</p>
