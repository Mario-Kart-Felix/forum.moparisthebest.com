    <description>Variable Types
A variable type is a description of the kind of information a variable will store. Programming languages vary regarding how strict they require you to be when declaring a variable&#39;s type. Some languages, like Perl, do not require you to announce the type of a variable. Other languages require you to declare some variables as numbers and others as text-strings, for example. C++, a strongly-typed language, requires you to be even more specific than that. Instead of declaring a variable as a number, you must say whether it will store integers or decimals. In C++, the type of an integer is int and the type of a decimal is float (floating-point number). 

Declaring Variables
Declaring a variable in C++ is simple. Let&#39;s say you want to declare a variable of type int called myAge. That is to say, the variable myAge will store an integer. In C++, this is written: 

int myAge;

All this does is tell the computer that you plan to use an integer, and that the integer&#39;s name is myAge. 

In some languages, variables are initialized to 0 - that is, a variable&#39;s initial value will be 0. This is not true of C++! Sometimes your variables will be initialized to 0, but sometimes they will be initialized with garbage. As you might anticipate, this can cause some nasty bugs. Here&#39;s a sample code. 

#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

int main() {
  int myAge;
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;My age is &quot; &lt;&lt; myAge &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}

You might expect the program to output &quot;My age is 0&quot;. In fact, the output of this program is unreliable. On one system you may get output of &quot;My age is 11&quot;; another system may output &quot;My age is 0&quot;; yet another system may output &quot;My age is 3145&quot;. That&#39;s what it means to have a variable initialized with garbage. 

It is always a good idea to initialize your variables with some value. If you don&#39;t know what a variable&#39;s initial value should be, initialize it to 0. Initializing a variable is easy. Let&#39;s fix the above program so that it always outputs &quot;My age is 22&quot;. The first line of the main function initializes myAge by assigning it a value immediately. 

#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

int main() {
  int myAge = 22;
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;My age is &quot; &lt;&lt; myAge &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}

That&#39;s all there is to it! By the way, the equals sign (&quot;=&quot;) is called an operator</description>
