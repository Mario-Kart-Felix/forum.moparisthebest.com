    <description>[CENTER][COLOR=&quot;DarkRed&quot;][SIZE=&quot;3&quot;]Welcome to Magneto&#39;s Mopar Thread![/SIZE][/COLOR]

[COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;]What is [I]Magneto[/I]? Magneto is a newly formed group which consist of over 20 developers, wanting to make a spectacular game. Are we creating our own game? Nope. We are completely remaking, and preexisting game. We are doing up to two games at once, and wanting to make them even better then the retail games. Only a few things we&#39;ll be doing;[/COLOR]
[COLOR=&quot;DarkRed&quot;]
[ul][I][*]New 3D Modeling
[*]Rich, custom, unforgettable content
[*]Never Before Seen Skills, Races, Cities, ect.
[*]MUCH More![/I][/ul]
[/COLOR]

[COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;]Yes, all that will be done. We are creating our own storyline, creating new cities (New buildings and items from our 3D Modelers), new quests that will always have you curious on what&#39;s going to happen next. Overall, a wonderful new private server, that can never be forgotten. [/COLOR]

 [COLOR=&quot;red&quot;]Your probably thinking all this is completely impossible, right? Wrong. We have the experienced developers and idealist&#39;s to make this all happen. However, we need YOUR help as well. We currently have a limited supply of developer and designers, and recruiting more daily. What are we looking for?[/COLOR]
[COLOR=&quot;DarkRed&quot;]
[ul][I][*]Java Developers (Will work with the Runescape game only)
[*]Visual Basic Developers (To create new &amp; custom programs)
[*]C++ Devleopers (To help create an extrordinary remake)
[*]3D Modelers &amp; Graphic Designers[/ul]
[/COLOR][/I]
[COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;]Okay, so your a developer, but how do you know your going to be accepted? Well, being able to code isn&#39;t everything. We work within a mature atmosphere and don&#39;t want 9 year olds taking our work all day. You are required to be mature around all staff, and the community itself at all times. Be able to work as a team. Last but not least, knowing what you&#39;re doing. We don&#39;t want to recruit anyone, and we won&#39;t. If you think you have a shot at becoming apart of the staff, please register on our [URL=http://&quot;http://www.magneto-gaming.tk&quot;]temporary forums[/URL] and make an introduction to us, saying who you are, what you&#39;ve done, and a little about yourself.[/COLOR]

 [COLOR=&quot;red&quot;]What else will we be doing? We will constantly share some of our new programs, scripts, and much more. We don&#39;t want to be the only ones who can use our customized ideals. ;)[/COLOR]

 [COLOR=&quot;DarkRed&quot;][SIZE=&quot;3&quot;]Benefits of joining;[/SIZE][/COLOR]
[COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;]There isn&#39;t some big payday you&#39;re gonna get. However, if your joining, you&#39;re going to be able to say your apart of the one of the worlds largest private gaming development team, which not too many people can say ;) We are small now, but this is only the beginning. I assure you, this is a serious project, and isn&#39;t going to end ANYTIME soon.

Not enough to convince you that we&#39;re the real deal? Then head over to our forums, and see for yourself. Requesting a personal meeting with the Managers and Owner? Great. We are happy to always talk with anyone with questions, as soon as possible.[/COLOR]
