    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some1-please-find-me-a-good-317-client-and-make-connect-for-me/393911</link>
    <description>Ok im sorry and it might make me sound retarded but i been coding on my server source probley 2weeks i&#39;d think? its not rly special but i used origional delta, and made it into a server alot like 1 i use to play before it went down called united pkz. (was my favorite server) well so i taught myself lot of basics and lil harder stuff coding it but the client is somereason giving me the hardest time. My server is online (mopar n runelocus says so). ports open (canyouseeme.com and like 4people who checked for me with teamviewer says so) and i changed setip to my servers ip and it loggs me on using my computer but anybody else trying to log on with my client cant connect. (i tested on my brothers computer + my friend tested on his). so now im just giving up on that and asking for yalls help.

-can some body find me a good 317 client for me and change the ip and stuff to make it log on to my server?
-server ip + port: kruntscape.no-ip.org, 43594.
The server i am basically remaking (with my own twists in it and editing) is called united pkz and it is alot like a 2speced server.. mabey that helps give idea of what i am needing. needs skillcapes (not emotes), torso, defenders, fire cape, void, astral runes, gs&#39;s, sarasword, anchients, lunars, and all that stuff. yes my server is a delta i been editing. So please if you know of or find me a client i can use change ip to kruntscape.no-ip.org for me and make sure it will let you logg in to my server please. upload it to megaupload and send link to me in pm or just in a reply. I will change name, and background.

If want see video of what ny server looks like so you know what my client needs watch this:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4MohQwITEE
ps: that video looks exactly like delta cause it was before i started doing my editing. but it still gives basic idea of what kind of client im needing.

I&#39;m sorry this is suck a big request of yall&#39;s coding knowledge and all but ill admit its because my coding knowledge obviously aint as good as i&#39;d like it to be.. (but im still trying and im still learning lol)
***If some1 does this for me and it works and has all stuff i need on it i will reward them in the server.(if they deside to join)***</description>

              <p>instead of a downloadable client you could try making one using rs-ps.0rg<br>
since its a delta use the “trendscape” one. NOT THE [PI] TRENDSCAPE ONE!</p>
