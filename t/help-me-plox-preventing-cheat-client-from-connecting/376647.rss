    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-plox-preventing-cheat-client-from-connecting/376647</link>
    <description>Hello Guys! I have just started a server based on PVP Evolution which is a 317 Delta and recently there are many noobs getting on my server using Cheat Client and Moving NPCs around, Exploiting etc. I would want to prevent this from happening and I tried following this tutorial http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,444519.0.html but I got this error when trying to connect to the server

as you can see it simply block out everyone from connecting.

Note: I did not mistype the UID, they matches on Client side and Server side.

Can Someone help me with this? Thank You

Yours Sincerely

Is vital, make sure you have that with the correct UID, client and everything compiled.</p>
