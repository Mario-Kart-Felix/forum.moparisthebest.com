    <title>[PI/Exion] Replacing the background on Toms Cache Suite</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-exion-replacing-the-background-on-toms-cache-suite/359620</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve edited the background to my liking, but no matter what I do, when I try to &quot;repack archive&quot;

I&#39;m always prompted with &quot;Cache must be rebuilt to avoid corruption, would you like to rebuild the cache?&quot;

I lose either way, if I push yes, it rebuilds it, but then it ruins EVERYTHING I&#39;ve edited in the cache so I have to start over from square one, I get all kinds of errors and such (I back up my files of course), and if I push no, it does nothing.

It&#39;s supposed to say files repacked successfully or something, what am I doing wrong?

I&#39;ve tried to &quot;Replace&quot; the file, and I&#39;ve tried deleting it, and creating a new one with the same name, but nothing seems to be working.</description>
