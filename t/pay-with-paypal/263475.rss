              <p>And how would i do that?</p>
<p>“Once you have reached your sending limit with your PayPal account, you must become Verified to continue sending money with our service”<br>
I haven’t sent anything so why would they require me to become verified?</p>
<p>I’ve already sent about €10 from my bank account to paypal and it’s for a domain and hosting services, but they still want me to get verified?</p>
