    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2011-based-server-with-working-bh-targets-and-ep/452422</link>
    <description>Ik this is a stupid question but is there any Rsps out there 2011 based with BH, Targets and EP as it was back in Runescape 2011?

My friend posted me a video off a server with working bh and targets, it did go offline 1 year ago.</description>
