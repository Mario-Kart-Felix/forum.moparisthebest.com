    <title>I have a question which may seem dumb lol</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-a-question-which-may-seem-dumb-lol/198184</link>
    <description>Erm right never done this before but how do i put say like someone types ::membership and they get membership and in moreinfo/members.txt how do i put so it saves it automaticly

[i]This question doesnt matter if you dont know it ;) just badly want to know how to save the members.txt when someone types ::membership[/i]
and if an admin takes away there membership it gets rid of there name? 

Thanks
Much appreciated if someone could tell me this xD never done this again once again.</description>

<p>The “player-ismember” is the code in char files for membership, change if needed.</p>
