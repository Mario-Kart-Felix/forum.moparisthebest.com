    <title>Homework poem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/homework-poem/384419</link>
    <description>hi i am in 8th grade AP ELA and i just want to get feedback on this poem i have to do for this clas...
its about clams :D

Clams,
kind of like families,
they sink down in their beds made of sand,
with each other,
People searching frantically,
their feet just almost tipping the head of a clam,
almost exposed,
the clams try to hide themselves,
down, deeper,
bubbles start floating to the surface,
one clam has been caught,
soon to be more.


that was the poem, please give feedback on it and tell me any lines or take away lines.</description>
