              <p>I’m pretty sure.</p>
<p>edit: just had an idea, if they added theora video to the client would that mean maybe they are adding fullscreen for non-members but implementing a video ad system in the client so u cant hide the ads?</p>
<p>also just read this "We’ve also improved the majority of the Magic spell sound effects, including those for elemental spells, spells from the normal spell book and the Ancient Magick spells. There are also a new set of Agility course sound effects, making use of sampled sounds. Along with this come a range of ambient sounds and effects for many areas throughout the game, including the Morytania swamp, Misthalin and Asgarnia, making for a more immersive game experience.</p>
<p>These are just the beginning, so look out for more audio and visual improvements in the near future!" which is probably why the ogg stuff is there.</p>
<p>OT: im going to try to clean my system it seems like i may be infected since my computer tried to randomly shutdown, and my antivirus program closed <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> freakin sucks.</p>
