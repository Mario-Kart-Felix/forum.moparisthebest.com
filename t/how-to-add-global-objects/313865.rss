    <title>How to add global objects</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-global-objects/313865</link>
    <description>[b]very simple tut on how to add global objects to your 317 server if u dont kno. please dont flame me this is my very first post and dont say this is very simple because i kno it is but some others dont kno how to do it. the tut isnt that big but straight to the point.

difficulty 0/10 too simple

     first go to ur client.java
search makeGlobalObject until you get to a big list of it then go to the bottom.

add another line just like the ones u see except the numbers ur gonna add is different than the others.

the first two sets of numbers are the location of where ur gonna put the object ( the x and y coordinates)

the next number is the object id and the number after that is the rotation of the object i recommend leave it at zero first then change it if thats not the direction u want it to face.

then the next number u just put 10 like all the others.

remember to make ur line look like all the others.

when ur done just save and compile and ur object should be there.

remember this is my first tut and actual post i did my best and hopefully its helpful to alot of people who are startin a server or who just dont kno how to do it.[b/]</description>
