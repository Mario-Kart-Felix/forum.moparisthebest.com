    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/scratch-server/368761</link>
    <description>It&#39;s very ambitious of me, and I am a still just a learner, but I&#39;ve decided to have a crack at writing from reference (not copy and paste) a &quot;server&quot; from scratch. 

I say a &quot;server&quot;, I mean something basic, as more of a learning curve. Not to development something amazing as I wouldn&#39;t be capable, but just the essentials needed to log in and walk around.

What I would like to know is where should I start? What should be added and in what order to do it in?

Here&#39;s what I got in mind:

&lt;blockquote&gt;*Logging in
*Player rendering
*Interfaces
*Clicking buttons
*Frames
*Disconnecting
*Player saving
*Player loading

Then:

-Items

	*Inventory
	*Ground
	*Equipping
	*Stacking
	*Banking
	*Write bonuses
	*Item on item
	*Item on ground item
	*Item on NPC
	*Item on player
	*Item on object

-NPCs

	*Rendering?
	*Animation
	*Player versus NPC
	*Damage calculation

-Objects

	*Loading
	*Interaction

Then:

*Clipping (player and NPC)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thanks for reading.</description>

<p>Ah yes, the first link is what I was reading earlier on today. Thanks for this, bookmarked for when I get a few hours to myself. Kudos to you.</p>

<p>Yeah, I read something about listening for connections earlier on. I will have to refer back to it. This is a good explanation though, I get how it works.</p>
<p>I’ve seen <a href="http://java.io" rel="nofollow noopener">java.io</a> and IOThreads(?) a lot but not really understood the whole IO part. Sounds important. Obviously stands for input/output right? I’m learning something. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Yeah I have something of Grahams on my hard drive, but not really understood it.</p>
<p>I’m really intrigued by it all, IO, ServerSockets, masks, packets etc. I’ve read and hoarded a whole heap of documents on my hard drive but not quite comprehended any of it. I know it’s not hard to learn after a while, my life’s just been unsettled recently. I’m trying to absorb as much information as I can and I seem to just take in a bit of everything and not enough of something. That’s why I asked about it, finally.</p>
<p>Your replies are appreciated.</p>

<p>The list is just my knowledge of what I thought should be. I did not anticipate client connections. I will have to re-think my strategy lol.</p>
<p>[quote=“Aftermath, post:4, topic:368761”]First, you need the actual server component that handles connections.</p>

<li>Server component (handles connection)</li>

</ol>
<p>Practically everything else from here in terms of functionality (item on item, item on player, etc…) is just handling and sending the correct packets.</p>
<p>After you’ve done all that stuff, you can add in features like saving player data and combat and whatever.</p>

<p>This is helpful. I will now do more browsing and analysing on what you have just said. Do you reccommend studying Winterlove, as it’s a basic source? I’m not looking at ultimate optimisation at first, I can do this once I know the basics of how a server is made.</p>
<p>[quote=“I Vain I”]First, decide which protocol you would like to base your server off of.<br>
Then decide which type of networking you are going to use.<br>
Then write the framework, which should consist of packets, rendering, and update blocks. etc.[/quote]</p>
<p>I would like to use the 317/377 protocol, as I am more familiar with this. Networking… is that sockets? I will have to study this before having a go. Framework also.</p>
<p>This has been helpful to me, guys. I know now what I’ve got ahead of me (more than I anticipated) I’m not saying I will create a successful server, because I won’t, but it’s a start and we all have to start somewhere.</p>
<p>Much obliged.</p>
