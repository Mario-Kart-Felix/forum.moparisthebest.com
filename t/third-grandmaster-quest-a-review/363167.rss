    <title>Third grandmaster quest -- a review</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/third-grandmaster-quest-a-review/363167</link>
    <description>For lack of a better place to put this right now, we see the third arrival of a RuneScape Grandmaster quest. Worth it? I&#39;d like to think not.

If you head over to the wikia, you can see the requirements of the quest are phenomenal. You need 80 magic, the highest requisite of any quest to date, among other level 70 requirements. You end up going through some seemingly challenging logic puzzles (easily remedied by a decent quest guide), and fighting a &quot;monstrous&quot; level 599. Comparable to Nomad? Not in a lifetime.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the queen seems pretty tough. She likes using all forms of combat, fights among elite pest control defilers, and has a special attack that hits 500 (but this can be blocked using a special from a weapon you get in the quest). Based on a video I watched, the queen seems to have lifepoints similar to Nomad, which would explain the high level. I would even argue she may have more lifepoints than Nomad, but this is to be determined.

As for the rewards, not so good if you ask me. You get about 120k experience spread over six skills, then two sets of 50k additional experience for any combat levels over 75. You get an elite Void torso, which is an &quot;upgraded&quot; version of the regular torso (which is, to say, it adds a decent +4 prayer bonus). You get a lousy one quest point, and Korasi&#39;s sword, which is used against the queen.

In fact, out of all the awards, the only remotely decent one [i]is[/i] Korasi&#39;s sword. This new weapon replaces the leaf-bladed sword as the highest stab attack weapon in the game, outside of Daemonheim. It has slightly better accuracy than the leaf-bladed sword (+8 slash, -7 in stab), but has a whopping +20 difference in strength. Korasi&#39;s sword actually surpasses the dragon scimitar in strength by +4. It is weaker than the abyssal whip by 12. Nevertheless, it has the same speed as all three.

Some quick opinions about the quest seem to be along the lines of a disappointment that no new boss monster was added and it being considered grandmaster. Otherwise, I think the sword is the only reason worth doing the quest in the first place, and quite a good reason at that. :)

What a long review. If only there were more huge updates for F2P low-leveled players. Also, Taharok, you have so many long posts.<br>

<p>I might be doing RS update review articles for the front page. This was kinda a preview, seeing if it’s a good idea or not. What do you think?[/quote]<br>
Well then that’d be the first (I’m assuming you’re talking about <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com</a>) update in a year! In that case, I doubt that people even visit the homepage.</p>
<p>I feel that articles must be divided into separate parts etc. Images or videos are a must or the article will just be plain, ol’, boring text. Just try to make the article, um… more interesting.</p>

<p>This is what I thought as well, but I have heard that the darklight won’t hit over a certain amount even with the ‘stab’ option selected, but I saw a debate on the RS forums and they were arguing over the exact same thing. I never got an answer though. But like I said, I really hope the new sword cannot be used effectively against corp.</p>

Minigame with levels.</p>
<p>Anyways, is the quest really worth training for and doing?  For the requirements, construction and summoning seem to be the only two that I’m not close to meeting, and they both would be worth leveling up.</p>

I finished the quest after about 2 hours after it was released and I thought it was alright and easy.<br>
The sword that you get is better than a dragon scimitar and you also get 2 books which gave 50k exp each.<br>
Along with that, you get an elite void torso.<br>

<p>I agree. There’s also the fight itself. I heard the fight was fun, etc. I had fun fighting Nomad, and it probably would be a good fight against the queen.</p>
