    <description>I am creating a server, Kainescape

Hamachi
Login: KaineScape
Password: kainescaperules

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s an IP or a no-ip because I can&#39;t get the compile.bat file to run.

Once I get it to run I will need a MOD or two and a coder (a coder, as I would like to make a monster that strictly drops T-Trails items) to help me somehow get the current version of RS and use that for my server. I want construction and everything. Basically my plan is to take everything in runescape currently, keep it the same, except for making levelling up easier and adding stuff to skills like smithable dragon, yada yada.

So I need some help getting my server to work and I need step by step help. I have everything needed to make a server, I just need the compile.bat to run KaineScape instead of Testscape. (I also wanna still be able to play Testscape though)</description>

<p>First, of all The ‘Monster’ is called a NPC, secondly you cant get the newest version of RS, you can only play the ‘Newest’ version if it here <a href="http://www.runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.runescape.com</a>, if you play a server or have one you should be getting the “terms” correct becasue youll look kinda not-intelligant.</p>
