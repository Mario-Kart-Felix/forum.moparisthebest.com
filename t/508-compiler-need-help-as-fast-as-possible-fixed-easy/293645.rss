    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-compiler-need-help-as-fast-as-possible-fixed-easy/293645</link>
    <description>Hey, Uhm Im new in the server bussiness, Uhmm but I know how to handle servers. The thing is, that with any source I use, I cant change anything. The reason of this I think is the Compiler, lets take Player Rights for example. When I try changing the player rights of any player, I change the &quot;0&quot; to a &quot;2&quot;. And I save the Notepad. After that I try logging in the account, and the account is either reseted, or not an administrator. Now this happens with everything, I mean I try to change commands and all kind of things, and after I try doing that, I compile. Once I compile it shows some errors, Here I will post A picture of what it says, Please Help.


Thank you for your help Aeolian. I&#39;ve Fixed it.. ;)
I would Rep++ you But I don&#39;t seem to have 15 Reputation myself. Anyways Thank you. :3
