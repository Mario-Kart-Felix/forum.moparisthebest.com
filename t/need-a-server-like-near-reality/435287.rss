              <p>Near Reality staff work hard to unkeep for the server. No one on these forums will ever make a server as complex and good as SoulSplit and Near Reality at least on this topic.</p>

<p>Stop asking people to do it for you and get up and work for it. Like the owners of new reality that worked for their server to be number 1 and now they sit back and get paid. You wanting to have a server like them is not a surprise because everyone does including myself but asking others to do it for you will only lead to one thing, Nothing.</p>

<p>This.</p>
<p>In all reality no server which has this newer revision garbage is “excellent” anyways. They’re cesspools of poorly-written code.</p>
