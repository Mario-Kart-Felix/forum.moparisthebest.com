    <title>The correct way to use a switch statement in a private server environment</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-correct-way-to-use-a-switch-statement-in-a-private-server-environment/378674</link>
    <description>Whilst there is not much difference on a small scale between if-else statements and switch statements (infact, it&#39;s probably a lot easier to create an if-else statement if you only want to check an argument for one or two results), on a large scale, it is easier on both the user and the program if switch statements are used.

Anyway, on with the guide.

The first part of a switch statement is the specification, as this specifies which variable you will be searching through.
[code]int i;
public static void main(String args[]) {
          switch(i) { //The specification

          }
}[/code]

Now, we must populate the switch statement with [b]cases[/b]. Say that if the variable is 0, and we want to send them a message saying &quot;I like zero&quot;, we would do this:
[code]case 0: //Which value will result in the action being performed.
System.out.println(&quot;I like zero&quot;); //Action
break; //End of the case.[/code]
Now, if you forget to put &quot;break;&quot;, it will ignore everything in that action and continue to search for the next break, for example doing this:
[code]case 0:
System.out.println(&quot;I like zero&quot;);
case 1:
System.out.println(&quot;i liek 1&quot;);
break;[/code]
If &quot;i&quot; was 0, it would instead print out &quot;i liek 1&quot;, so remember to put the breaks! (In some cases, not breaking the case can be useful, however.)

And that&#39;s it!
If something hasn&#39;t been fully explained, ask here!

To use this in a private server environment, you would do something like the following:
[code]switch(ItemID) {
case 1057:
SendMessage(&quot;H&#39;ween Mask!&quot;);
break;
}[/code]</description>

<p>The main reasoning behind this rule, is because Sun (I guess Oracle now) already had a nice set of tutorials for Java.</p>
