    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-i-need-to-do-to-make-my-server-a-no-ip-server/221086</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, i am having some trouble with making my server a no-ip.
[b]-I made an account
-Created a host
-Downloaded the DUC thing from www.no-ip.com
-Went to my network thing, and did the port-to-port thing.[/b]

I do not know what i have done wrong, or what else i need to do to make my server work as a no-ip.

Just need some help, Thanks a lot.
