    <description>Background
Erwin Chargaff discovered that although the nucleotide composition of DNA varies from one species to another,that composition always follows certain rules. While the variation in nucleotides helps to explain the complexity of life, the physical structure of the DNA itself can also help certain organisms adapt to particular environments. Imagine you are working with a research team sampling the ocean floor near a hot vent that releases a steady stream of
hot water. The hot water has a temperature of about 45°C, while the surrounding ocean has a temperature of 6°C.


Your team collects two samples of bacteria — one from the mouth of the hot vent, and one from the ocean floor about 20 m away. When you return to the lab, you isolate the DNA from these bacteria to determine their nucleotide composition. The table shows the results of your test for the adenine content of the DNA.

Apply what you have learned about Chargaff’s findings and
DNA composition to solve the following problems.

1. Complete the table to determine the amounts of the
other nucleotides found in each DNA sample.

2. For each DNA sample, draw a linear stretch of DNA
about 15 nucleotides long, with a nucleotide
composition that corresponds to its data set. With a
dotted line, illustrate the hydrogen bonds between
complementary base pairs.

3. Considering the bonds between base pairs, which
of these DNA samples is most likely taken from the
bacteria collected at the mouth of the hot vent?
Explain your answer.


The table: I filled out the stuff in the red (hopefully its correct) [IMG]http://i49.tinypic.com/50nvax.jpg[/img] 

I have a hard time doing the second question, which is to draw the thing, can you please help me, i try to then i get decimal stuff to draw such as since adenine is 31%, thus (.31)(30) = 9.3

how can i draw .3 of adenine. or am i doing something wrong, please help me with the second and the third question.

i got this assignment due tomorrow Please help, i would really appreciate it.
