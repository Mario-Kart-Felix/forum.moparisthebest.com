<p>Err, quite a lot of things, but unless you connect the wrong wire to something or forget to plug the fans in, not a lot really.</p>

3:</span> What are your own experiences?[/quote]</p>
<p>I had a bit of trouble with some of the wires and the computer fans(case came with fans with wires that were a bit too short), and I also had sore legs, and back etc. I built it on the floor. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

4:</span> About price for the parts that will be used to make a good gaming computer. Able to run Crysis.[/quote]</p>
<p>It depends where you buy the parts, what parts you need and other things. The PC I built(a few months ago, around March) was around £750 GBP and it plays Crysis reasonably well(all settings on high, 8x anti-aliasing unless it’s the levels with snow, then 4). I’m sure around this time(with christmas sales, etc) you could build a PC that runs Crysis reasonably well for $/£500 odd.</p>
<p>After looking around for similar spec computers, I found it was a good £100-200 cheaper, if you add the cost of a new monitor etc, it’s roughly around the same as a new PC with all the extras. If you think about it though, you built it so you know what everything is, and where it goes, so you can easily upgrade if you ever need to. You can also buy good hardware so you know it’ll last.</p>
<p>I’d say it’s worth it if you want to do it, or save money(because you will if you don’t need to buy anything extra), but if you’re not fussed about either, you should just buy a pre-built one.</p>
