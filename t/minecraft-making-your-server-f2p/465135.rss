Didn&#39;t see a tutorial, then again I MIGHT have overlooked it, but this is relatively simple to do. This will allow anyone to login on your server without having paid for minecraft. Is this unsecure? Possibly because it doesnt require account verification. There are probably a few mods to stop griefers and such, so those are suggested. (I would&#39;nt know, just started with MCPC).

Anyway, first of all after running Minecraft, you will notice some new files in its root folder. The one we need is called server.properties. Edit this file with any text editor and you need to do the following:

First we need to change this:

[code]online-mode=true[/code]

to this:
[code]online-mode=false[/code]

then at the bottom of the file, we are going to add:

[code]verify-names=false[/code]


Please note, that this will disable all name verification on the minecraft server, meaning that anyone can login with any username. I suggest having a mod like Moparcraft, which is just plain fucking awesome. 

If this stuff isnt allowed, please remove. kkthxbai.</description>
