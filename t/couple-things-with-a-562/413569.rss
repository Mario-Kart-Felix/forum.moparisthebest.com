    <title>Couple things with a 562</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/couple-things-with-a-562/413569</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i&#39;m looking for a decently experienced 562 with a couple problems i can&#39;t seem to fix, i tried of course so i&#39;m not being lazy, but it just wont work.

2 examples of problems i have is:

1. Dragon claws spec-hits normal, then after the last hit of a spec, it hits a 5th hit that hits like thousands.

2. Any Ice spell in ancients, as in barrage, blitz etc. Doesn&#39;t freeze the target, and theres no magicvsnpc. 

Thanks if you can help, and if needed, you can have in game power, or a payment of some sort, thanks.</description>
