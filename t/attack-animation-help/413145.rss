    <title>Attack animation help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/attack-animation-help/413145</link>
    <description>So I added that 525 animation tutorial by SWAT and everything was working pretty well until I noticed that when I attack the weapon disappears. I know that this isn&#39;t about the getanim crap, cause I&#39;ve added all the weapon anims and stuff but that didn&#39;t fix the problem.
Also whenever I use my client with a dodian base it seems to show the weapon when attacking but it&#39;s really messed up.

Server base: Delta cleaned by Johnny J
Client: non-renamed

Can anyone help?
Thanks</description>
