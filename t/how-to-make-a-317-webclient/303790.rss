[b]Jaring and Signing the Webclient[/b]

  Download this :
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=0HMWFH7F

  Then clear EVERY thing out of the manifest folder.
If you don&#39;t have anything in your manifest folder then skip that step.
After you done that, open the BAT File. Set the output directory to your client folder. change the application.jar to anything you want. BUT KEEP THE .JAR PART!!!
Set the input directory to your clients folder.
Then hit the manifest template button, for the main class put client
Then hit the set manifest button, then hit the Create Jar! button
Signing the Jar
Hit the Jar Signer tab.
For the out put file put the path to your clients folder, and change the application.jar to whateveryouwant.jar
For the signed Jar file put signed_JARNAME
For The Jarsigner path, put the path to your jarsigner.
It should be something like what is allready there.
Then hit the Generate Keystore button/
For keytool location put the path to keytool.exe (should be something like what they have).
For output keystore file put the path to your client folder, and put Keystore as the file name.
Fill in all of the other boxes (self explained). Except the City, Province, country (unless you want to).
And hit generate keystore.
Then for the Keystore file, put the path to the one you just made (should be in clients folder).
And fill out the Keystore alias, Public key, and private key (there what ever you set them as).
And hit Sign Jar!


[b]Making it Public[/b]

  This is easy, take your folder, right click it, and compress it to both formats zip, and rar. and post it in Plunder and start advertising it on Moparscape Server Stauts.</description>
