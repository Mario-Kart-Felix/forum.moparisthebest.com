    <title>Petition to open official RSC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/petition-to-open-official-rsc/268298</link>
    <description>Thanks to this great read i found by Errorist http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,354028.0.html

Makes me think, if enough people care im sure jagex would give us a few worlds where everything is exactly the same as it was (and open to the public) instead of their &#39;cheat code idea&#39; of getting max stats, thats plain boring.

I encourage everyone who reads this and actually cares (or would love to see the original RSC back, and forget all these private servers) and combine this world into 1 great place again, to tell their friends and get as many people to sign the petition as possible.

[url=http://www.gopetition.com/online/26244.html]Sign the Petition Here![/url]

Also anyone who is a member on Runescape can create a post in the Classic section of Jagex forums, with the petition link.

Anyone who has a private server, i suggest posting it on forums and getting as many of your private server players to join, because nobody wants to hang around crappy private servers any longer, everyone in the real deal is always better.

Thanks</description>

<p>Your post is probably the first out of thousands of posts mentioning “rsc” and “petition” that isn’t asking us to sign a petition to bring back rsc. Forgive us for skipping over most of it.</p>
<p>As for the cheating rsc servers, I probably won’t play. I realize how dumb this sounds, but being able to instantly get stats/items makes it too easy and I’d rather bot.</p>
<p>At least then all the rs2 products won’t come over just so they can have 99 flats and make rsc full of mongoloids for the first few months.</p>
<p>Plus i doubt they will bring back the f2p style servers, and f2p pking was always much better.</p>

<blockquote>Hi,
I recently received a number of questions from the RuneScape Classic community which I have tried to answer as best I can below 
<hr>
<p>Q) (Ill Pun Ill) Will RuneScape Classic ever be reopened to the public, If so when and how?<br>
A) I would love to see RSC open to the public again, whilst now comparatively “retro” in appearance by<br>
comparison to the current High Detail version of RuneScape it’s still a great game which posses a unique<br>
charm and we are still deeply proud of our ground breaking roots.<br>
The key problem with opening up the game to the public is the absence of the anti-cheating and macro systems<br>
we have built up over the last few years, it is also the case that RSC contains all the features that were causing<br>
real world trading and therefore incentivising credit card fraud.</p>
<p>From above it is clear we simply cannot open the current RSC game to the public without some substantial changes.<br>
Our development efforts are almost exclusively focused on evolving the latest version of RuneScape and therefore I<br>
suspect it would be years before we could “fix” RuneScape Classic.</p>
<p>One idea that we are considering is perhaps opening the current RSC game to the public but providing everybody with<br>
the cheat codes to set their skills and inventory to whatever they liked. That way everybody could have whatever<br>
they wanted in game and there would be no incentive or advantage to cheat or bot.<br>
Naturally the RSC account would be isolated to RSC worlds and could never interact with the current version of RuneScape</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dont be so quick to doubt.</p>

Rsc is being opened again. They are working on making cheating useless by basically allowing you to change your stats etc.</p>

              <p>Thanks to this great read i found by Errorist <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,354028.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,354028.0.html</a></p>
<p>Makes me think, if enough people care im sure jagex would give us a few worlds where everything is exactly the same as it was (and open to the public) instead of their ‘cheat code idea’ of getting max stats, thats plain boring.</p>
<p>I encourage everyone who reads this and actually cares (or would love to see the original RSC back, and forget all these private servers) and combine this world into 1 great place again, to tell their friends and get as many people to sign the petition as possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gopetition.com/online/26244.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Sign the Petition Here!</a></p>
<p>Also anyone who is a member on Runescape can create a post in the Classic section of Jagex forums, with the petition link.</p>
<p>Anyone who has a private server, i suggest posting it on forums and getting as many of your private server players to join, because nobody wants to hang around crappy private servers any longer, everyone in the real deal is always better.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
