    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-been-banned-by-accident-a-third-time/33676</link>
    <description>Yes, it has happened again, I&#39;m using firefox if you are wondering how I got on :) But it says a 14 day ban...next time a perm ban. I really don&#39;t want to be perm banned so could someone sort this out? Thanks,

              <p>Guys, I had same thing… i got banned, and the AOL theory makes much sense…<br>
I got 3 day ban for spamming (temp) and 14 day ban for breakign rule number 12.</p>
<p>wow, the only reason i can think of me getting the temporary 3 day ban is because of mladen… he started server team, i joined, i quit, started my own, he got angry, we argued, he spammed and advertized for himself on my thread, i said how u like spamming on his thread, i think i took mladen’s punishmet… CURSE HIM~!</p>

<p>If you are able to pm while banned, tell an online mod (or me) of the situation along with your current ip, and one of us can try to go through the ban triggers list and remove that ip. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>I assume you’re using AOL (based on a couple of ips you’ve posted from).  AOL provides you with a different ip every time you connect, which means that you might be getting someone else’s randomly who was ip banned.  This is the primary negative aspect of ip banning.  But if you try reconnecting, you should hopefully get a different ip without that ban message.</p>
