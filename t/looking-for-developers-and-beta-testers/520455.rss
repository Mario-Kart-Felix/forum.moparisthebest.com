    <title>Looking for developers and beta testers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-developers-and-beta-testers/520455</link>
    <description>As the title suggests Renatus 718 is looking for developers and beta testers. Currently, there are two people including myself that are working on this.

First, a little bit about the server and what we have already:

A [B]fully [/B]functional, [B]ready[/B] for release, server source. 
[B]Two[/B] 8gb VPS. One for the server, one for the website &amp; forum (the domain and server expenses are and always will be paid for by me).
Licensed version of IPB, with IP. Nexus and IP. Content

(The thread will be updated with server features tomorrow)

----

Currently, we need somebody to maintain, and design the webclient/forum/website, as well as work on the Client. In return you will be given an in-game and forum rank according to how you contribute to the server.

[B]Application Form[/B]:
[CODE]
[B]Name: [/B]
[B]Age: [/B]
[B]Skype Name: [/B]
[B]What are you applying for? (Web/Java/Beta-Tester): [/B]
[B]What experience do you have? (Not needed for Beta Tester): [/B]
[B]Why should we pick you?: [/B]
[/CODE]

Even if you do not plan on applying, thank you for reading this thread.

PS. Most if not ALL beta testers will be accepted.</description>
