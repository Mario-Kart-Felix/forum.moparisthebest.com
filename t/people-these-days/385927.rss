    <description>I just got back from the city with a group of people, because theres this festival thing called moomba on tonight.
I personally saw around 8 fights, for no reason.

I have been in my share of fights, but they have all been for a reason.
I dont understand why these fuckheads do it.</description>

<p>So what you’re saying is, a human should follow their natural instinct and fight whenever they feel like fighting because the body is able to heal?<br>

<p>haha, just like my school… Asian who do it mostly to either other asians or whites for no reason.<br>
IDK why but they think they are bad, yet they are fucked in the brain.</p>

</aside>
<p>Im not trying to sound tough, or pur anyone who uses this site down, but Im not the sterotypical “computer geek”<br>
I kick it with “gangsters” and all that bullshit, and I end up fighting, but theres always a reason.<br>
I just dont understand these fuckheads.<br>
They pick on people littler or in smaller groups.<br>
Noone even second looked me and the people I was with, because there was like 15 of us, and were all big.<br>
I hate people like that,<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>If theres a reason, then thats fine… I fight if there is a reason to fight the person but otherwise i don’t even think about it.<br>
People who just come up to you and punch you (You have those faggots at times. Mainly in school), I just punch them back.</p>
<p>And where do you live? Im in UK and the only time i see people fighting are at night when there drunk.[/quote]</p>
<p>Im inmelbourne, australia.<br>
We have alot of street violence here</p>
