    <description>[b][i][u]I HAVE A PIMPSCAPE SOURCE![/u][/i][/b]
Whenever someone disconnects on my server it doesn&#39;t save for them, this is what comes up: &quot;Could not save for Matt&quot; the &quot;Matt&quot; is different obviously because that&#39;s my name on my server.  The point is why is this happening to me now?  Before it&#39;d save just fine and I even did [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,52132.0.html]this tutorial[/url]which I knew wouldn&#39;t help, but did it anyway.  Why does it do that?  So in my server, you have to auto-save to save...If you don&#39;t know about the &quot;could not save for *PLAYER*&quot; could you please tell me how to speed up auto-save?  Thanks!

Whenever someone disconnects on my server it doesn’t save for them, this is what comes up: “Could not save for Matt” the “Matt” is different obviously because that’s my name on my server.  The point is why is this happening to me now?  Before it’d save just fine and I even did <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,52132.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this tutorial</a>which I knew wouldn’t help, but did it anyway.  Why does it do that?  So in my server, you have to auto-save to save…If you don’t know about the “could not save for <em>PLAYER</em>” could you please tell me how to speed up auto-save?  Thanks!<br>
