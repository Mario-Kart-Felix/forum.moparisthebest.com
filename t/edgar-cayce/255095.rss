<p>But just my opinion on these channels, or any tv channel: I enjoy watching them, but never expect them to tell you the truth. They care about money, not about historical evidence. Plus the fact that they usually show you the story in such a way that it fits into the social expectations. Just to bring up one example: According to many historical shows I’ve seen, Hitler was nothing more then a crazy lunatic. Most people don’t expect a story about the great plans he and Albert Speer had.</p>
