    <title>Runescape New Skills?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-new-skills/376766</link>
    <description>If you could choose some new skills for RuneScape, what would you choose?

I&#39;m not overly sure what I would choose, but one would definitely be Enchanting or Enchantment.
Like enchanting armor or weapons and they come up with a little (e) or something next to it.

<p>best lol. Even though I know your joking. It would be cool if they added a world like bh.<br>
But the pking style would be of classic, you know catching, no autocast, bird-eye view camara,<br>
no running,the 3 hit system etc. It would only work in f2p of course. I can’t see anything bad with this<br>
tbh.</p>

<p>Lol.</p>
<p>To be frank, I think they’ve covered everything, more or less. Most of what is being said is either retarded, a potential update to a current skill or potentially quest/minigame-related. I mean, for example:</p>
<p>[quote=“QuestMaster 2K10, post:30, topic:376766”]RuneScape is a Medieval based fantasy game; You can’t just add something that won’t fit in with the game or the game will seem too unreal to play. My suggestions would be:</p>
<p>Sailing (You build a boat with Woodcutting materials, and etc. and if you have a high enough Sailing level you can use them to travel to places accross water.</p>
<p>Herding (Any single animal that can be found walking around would have a right-click option saying ‘Herd’ - when you click he’ll walk 3 steps opposite to where you’re standing.</p>
<p>Digging/Exploring (A level where if you walk over certain places a message will appear, or an NPC’s face will appear with a message that you’re close to treasure, and will ask you to dig around the surrounding area. Once you dig it up, you’ll get XP (not always will there be treasure, it could just be cabbage!)</p>
<p>Like my ideas?[/quote]</p>
<p>Sailing  - A fair and original idea, but a whole skill based on travel sounds wasteful, but could definitely be a tie-in to construction, perhaps a ‘Dock’ room for higher levels or… whatever floats your boat (OMGIMJOKES) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Herding - Y’mean like in Sheep Herder, the quest you get in west Ardougne? This sounds like an odd hybrid of the hunter and farming skills to me…</p>
<p>Digging/Exploring - Treasure trails already have this down, say no more <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>Hate to burst your bubbles guys, but I think all that needs doing is updating the current skills. Add mounted capabilities to summoning, add different melee styles, new spellbooks, but I honestly believe as far as true innovation goes, it’s all been done.</p>
<p>…but that’s just me.</p>

I think construction should involve other skills including farming etc.</p>
<p>E.g. 1: You make a tree patch in your garden, then once it has grown you hav to woodcut it.</p>
<p>E.g. 2: Build a pond in your garden and it allows you to fish certain things depending on your level and after that then cook it on your houses stove/fire.</p>
<p>It is a pretty good idea in some ways if you think about it.<br>

<p>I always loved this idea, but it makes <span class="bbcode-b">botting</span> just too easy.[/quote]<br>

<p>Judging by Dungeoneering, this new skill probably won’t even be a skill. Dungeoneering may be creative and has had a lot of effort put forth, but it’s not a skill. Just a mini-game. Also Summoning is was just as bad. You gain the ability to merge items into a pouch by merging items into a pouch over and over and over again, which makes no sense. With every other skill, practice that makes sense gets you better, which in turn means better things. Not in these cases. I honestly expect the new skill to blow.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Dunno, seems like Jagex is starting to diverge from “production” skills. All of the new skills they’ve released since the beginning have been production skills, minus Slayer and Dungeoneering. Other than the new ones, you still have most of the old ones–mining, smithing, woodcutting, thieving, crafting, fletching, etc. Dungeoneering was a really new perspective, seeing as it managed to incorporate every other skill in the game, yet not produce any items. I’m feeling Jagex is making a new movement toward non-production skills.</p>
<p>At the same time, I can’t envision anything they would add on that they couldn’t already incorporate. Jagex does have a lot of creativity, I won’t lie. Slayer is a very excellent skill, and RuneScape is pretty unique in possessing it (as far as I know, anyway). Dungeoneering seems like a copycat of dungeon instances in WoW, but players have been ranting for eons about having dungeons and such like WoW. Jagex did a good job in creating a dynamic world in which these dungeons exist. I think it’s both unique and enjoying.</p>
<p>Most of the other skills people discuss, like breeding or sailing, can be easily tied in with existing skills. Breeding is obviously something Jagex considered, but they didn’t put into the Summoning skill for whatever reason, probably to simplify the game. Sailing is tied closely with construction, but is a lot more complicated (almost unnecessarily). The world doesn’t even seem large enough to accommodate something like sailing. How could everyone own their own boat? Where would the boat travel? Could boats be shared among players? Would they be specific to POHs? How would they have practical use if they are restricted to POHs?</p>
<p>Beyond that, balderdash. Jagex promised us a new skill late 2010, early 2011. I guess we’ll see whatever it is. I’m guessing they are probably going to try pushing the 120 limit again, as well.</p>

this would be hard as hell… but… you can make your own dungeon, like if your level lets say 30 dungeonering, 1 floor, 50, 2 floors, 65, 3 floors, 70, 4 floors, 75, 5 floors, 80, 6 floors, 85, 7 floors, 90, 8 floors, 95, 9 floors, 99 lets you have 20, i know there is a dungeon, but im talking about building one were u have to use all ur skills etc, not just killing<br>
and on the last floor, you can make a boss, but you would need a special item from the boss you wanted to make,<br>
Lets say u want kbd as your boss (i dont know any of the dungeonering bosses) so rarely while vsing the boss, you get a extremely rare drop of some kind, like KBD’s Horn, that, 99 con, 40m, and the horn to have KBD as your boss, and you get the horn from RS’s dungeon.<br>
I got this idea from runespaces post, when he said 8 floors deep <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Thats a good idea bro, but some people might not have 99 con for the boss. Maybe players can use summoning instead and make titans for bosses…[/quote]<br>
I know, but it would kind of be an achievement to have a boss, is kind of what im sayin, you know? like steel dragon is at 95, its a high lvl, but ppl still buy it, dunno, just my opinion.</p>

<p>Something dealing with water, like the highly-wanted Sailing or boat building skill. I feel there needs to be some other sort of skill involving architecture. Construction isn’t really free. I remember some other good skill suggestions but can’t recall exactly what they were.</p>
