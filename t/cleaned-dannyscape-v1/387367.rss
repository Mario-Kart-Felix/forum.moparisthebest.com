    <title>Cleaned Dannyscape V1</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cleaned-dannyscape-v1/387367</link>
    <description>I have noticed that many delta users seem to use Dannyscape V4 simply because people are lazy and cannot be bothered to add things in themselves and mainly because they are just leechers who cannot do anything by themselves.

I am cleaning out Dannyscape V4 for those who wish to leech a more stable version of the source.

This is currently V1 and I shall be releasing Many more versions on this until I feel that there is nothing more I can do to perfect the stability of the source. Not only am I trying to make it have a good stability, I am also removing a lot of the crap that uses up process.

I am not just removing things but I am also changing things and also adding in a few little features so that it saves all you leechers a job looking at tutorials etc.

This comes with the source only and not the client so please visit the original thread for the client.

[u]Removed Log: 21/03/11.[/u]
Removed quests.
Removed all monsters and their drops (add them yourself).
Cleaned out shops.cfg.
Removed all unneeded commands (spec, master etc).
Removed all useless menus.
Removed all the useless documents in config, notes and data.
Fight caves is now jad only.
Removed control panel, highscores and mysql.
Removed gambling and the ugly skillcape emote code.

[u]Added Log: 21/03/11.[/u]
My item on interface clue scrolls.
Added more and cleaned up the coordinates document.

[u]Credits:[/u]
90% everyone who contributed in making this source.
10% me for cleaning it out, adding a few features and making it more stable.

You may think that I have not done anything but this is just the start of what will be the greatest, most improved deltascape source you will find anywhere.

Also if you think I havent done anything then just simply look at the file size. It has gone down over 1mb which is quite a lot of data.</description>
