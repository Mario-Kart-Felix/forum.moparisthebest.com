    <description>I was just wondering if someone can kindly explain how because, i thought you&#39;d have to go to unpackedshops.txt and then do the editing/making there but it seems that it&#39;s not working, i probably have to go in there, but i&#39;m either doing something wrong so can someone please help? Thanks a lot.  :)</description>
