    <title>Character saved, but no Character file?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/character-saved-but-no-character-file/543765</link>
    <description>Hi there,

I&#39;ve recently started working on a PI based source and client, and have been struggling to get it to load in eclipse and actually run - however, I&#39;ve finally worked it all out!

...The only problem now is that when I log in, although the location of my player is saved, I can&#39;t find where! There is a Character.txt file in the server folder, but it doesn&#39;t update with new player&#39;s txt files! I&#39;d like to change the player rights and skills of the player but I can&#39;t find his file!


This is what I found in the player save.java which seems to correspond to what I want:

try {
			characterfile = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;./Data/characters/&quot;+playerName+&quot;.txt&quot;));
			File1 = true;
		} catch(final FileNotFoundException fileex1) {
		}
		if (File1) {
			new File (&quot;./characters/&quot;+playerName+&quot;.txt&quot;);
		} else {
			Misc.println(playerName+&quot;: character file not found.&quot;);
			p.newPlayer = false;
			return 0;
		}

But it doesn&#39;t seem to actually do its job...?

I&#39;m not sure whether I have to link anything here or not, so I wont for the moment, but if any additional information is needed let me know!</description>

              <p>Thanks - I’ve fixed my problem lol. I couldn’t see the txt files in the characters folder, but it turned out that was because I didn’t refresh eclipse and so they didn’t show up…</p>
<p>xD</p>

              <p>Your character file should save in the “characters” folder, which is in the Data folder.<br>
If you have it set up  like a typical PI. The data folder is in the same folder as the src and bin folders.</p>
