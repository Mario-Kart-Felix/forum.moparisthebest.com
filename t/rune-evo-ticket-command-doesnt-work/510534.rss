<p>If your servers online ::ticket was ment to be used by players to sugest help from staff, that explains the type ticket to answer becuz if your servers not online theres no players to type ::ticket, now if you want to change ::ticket to recieve vote tickets or what ever your planing on using it for then id suggest you go to (rune evo source is the same one im using) your player commands and change it there or in your admin commands, donator etc.  hope this helps, if not im sure theres something that can be done <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
