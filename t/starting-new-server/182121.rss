    <title>Starting New Server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/starting-new-server/182121</link>
    <description>Hello my name is Bonzakid and I have previously made these servers (You might of not heard of them before).
SeaScape V1, SeaScape V3.0, UnbornFury, FirePhoenixScape and my first one i ever made &quot;AncientScape&quot; Until someone stole the name back this year previously..

I am starting a new server up again and need your help! If you would like to help me accomplish with this new server it would be wonderful and people will love it!

I am planning on making this server an enjoyable one where people can PK and skill. People can do other features and enjoy the game and do minigame(s). There will be events being held on the server.

              <p>Just an idea for you. Add what you are planning on making on this server, if its going to be dedicated. Some pieces of code you have made so people join your Development team.<br>
