    <description>An Airplane&#39;s altitude is 100 ft as it is descending for a landing on a runway whose touchdown point is 5000 ft away. Let the x-axis represent the distance on the ground and the y-axis represent the airplane&#39;s altitude.

what is the slope of the airplane&#39;s descent?

What is the y-intercept of the airplanes descent?

Write an equation of the line that follows the path of the airplanes descent.

Im pretty sure the y intercept is 100 but i don&#39;t know for a fact please any help would be greatly appreciated with an explanation on how to work out the answer. ;D</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Slope is the rise over run of a line.  Mathematically, m = Δy/Δx (change in y / change in x).  In this case, Δy = 100 and Δx is 5000.  Thus, m = 100/5000 = 1/50</p>
<p>As for the y-intercept, it depends how you write your graph.  You could start at x = 0 with the plane at y = 100, or you could have the landing point as the origin.  For the former example, the y-intercept would indeed be y = 100.  For the later, it would be y = 0.</p>
