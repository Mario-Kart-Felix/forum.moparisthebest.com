    <title>Unturned 2</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unturned-2/545849</link>
    <description>[i]Unturned is a Free to play, Multiplayer Zombie Survival game. The game is fairly new and was released on Steam on July 7, 2014. The game is constantly being updated with new features, and it never gets boring. [/i]

[i]Personal Rating: 5/5[/i]


Note: This game is only available on [url=http://store.steampowered.com/]Steam[/url]

[b]Gameplay:[/b] It is a bit difficult starting out, and is very slow. You will die a lot trying to get started up which can be extremely frustrating. After getting used to the gameplay style it made it a lot easier (Mostly combat wise). Within 10 hours of scavenging I built a camp and learned to craft. After expanding it becomes a lot more fun. The game is a lot like Day-Z with graphics quite similar to Roblox. I recommend this game to anybody who enjoys hardcore survival games.

[b]Features:[/b] The game has many added features to both benefit you in-game and enhance your game-play experience.

[ul][li]Unturned Gold: Is a paid feature that allows buffs in-game to better you off in-game.[/li]
[li]Skills: Unturned has a point system that allows you to level up skills using experience points to help you perform tasks easier.[/li]
[li]Multiplayer: The game is a multiplayer online game, where you can choose to survive with others or survive independently. PvP can be toggled on or off by the host[/li]
[li]Crafting: Crafting can be used to expand and build shelter, fortresses etc.[/li]
[li]Heroes: Players can join player versus environment servers to team up with other people, and easily create clans to play with their pals. [/li]
[li]Character: Character customization to change your appearance[/li][/ul]

[b]Exploring:[/b] Unturned&#39;s map is an okay size, i&#39;d like it if it was a little bit bigger. After about 30 hours of gameplay I had familiarized myself with the map and know my way around quite easily. It was a lot of fun exploring though as a beginner!

[b]Graphics:[/b] I enjoy the graphics a lot. They are much like Roblox. It can be hard to see during the night so anything that emits light is highly useful. There is blood, but that can easily be toggled on or off in the game settings.

              <p>Wanted to add something. This game <span class="bbcode-b">will</span> run under linux on a low-end system. I currenty only have a simple Acer C720 chromebook with lubuntu 14.04 with a few fixes for better hardware support. I can run Unturned 2 on lowest settings, with 150% draw distance and still get a nice framerate. Just install the newest wine, install Steam (may need to disable dwrite.dll, I have to). Runs great under Wine.</p>

I actually think it looks like it could be a blast, especially if I’m playing with friends. I’ll check it out.</p>
<p>Btw, nice review. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

<p>Agree’d, but if you have a few friends playing LAN or even hosting a private server it’s even more enjoyable. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
