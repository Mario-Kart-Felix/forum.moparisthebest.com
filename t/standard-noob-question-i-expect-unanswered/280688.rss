    <title>Standard noob question I expect UNANSWERED</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/standard-noob-question-i-expect-unanswered/280688</link>
    <description>Ok, I am not a complete stranger to private servers, I had briefly hosted one about 2 years ago with Hamachi (lol) and the tutorials here were pretty much copy and paste as I didn&#39;t have a clue what I was doing. I have spent a year programming in Actionscript, and if anyone else has then you will know the similarities are so close they might as well be the same thing. Anyway, I decided to give this a go again and I just can&#39;t seem to.

I have followed the tutorial to hosting a server, I have my No-IP. But how do I get to go onto my game? Do I need to change something in the code to associate my No-Ip to the client? If I could log on then the rest would be easy. I can&#39;t remember what I did to get it running. I remember running the &#39;compile&#39; file then &#39;runserver&#39;, and logging in to see my changes, it was all on pimpscape if that still exists lol. 

Secondly, whenever I try to load http://www.moparisthebest.com/ to try and use the client to log onto my server (was going to play around as I didn&#39;t know how) the Java loading symbol comes up for a few seconds and the screen goes black. Then the pages on these forums are not accessible, if I refresh they do not load. This lasts for 10-15mins then it&#39; back to normal. Any idea what is causing this? It was working fine before I installed Mopar on my comp (which doesn&#39;t seem to load properly either).

Sorry for being a noob, but I&#39;ve been trying for 1-2 hours now and I am out of options.  :(

Please help :S[br][br][size=1]Posted on: May 27, 2009, 05:08:16 pm[/size][hr]Please help, I&#39;m sure there is a simple solution.  :(</description>

<p>Really I don’t think your experianced at all. No-ip is a step int he process but you MUST portforward!</p>
<p>Do you know what portforwarding is?</p>

              <p>Ok thanks for the responses. How can I test it myself though? I have another computer downstairs I can use to check (will see soon) but I want to test things on the same computer. I tried 127.0.0.1 as the IP which works, but is that the correct way to get onto my server so that if other people were there I would see them?</p>
<p>I am using Silab client webpage for now because the mopar client doesn’t work at all for me. I have re/installed java many times and it makes no difference. I have no trouble with Java applications like the usual RS etc, just seems to be Mopar.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: May 27, 2009, 08:43:23 pm[/size][hr]Ok I have managed to fix the annoying port forwarding, I just repeated what I did, changed the last number to 4 and re-added UDP again. So people can join me <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>The mopar client still doesn’t work though. The downloaded version will stop at the image below, then after about 10 seconds it closes. Any reason for it?<br>

<p>Have a friend test it out from his computer and ask him to try to log in from the hostname. (ex. <a href="http://Myserver.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Myserver.no-ip.org</a>)</p>
