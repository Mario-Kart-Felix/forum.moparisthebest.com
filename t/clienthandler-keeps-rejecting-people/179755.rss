    <description>Heya,

i&#39;ve been having a problem when i try to login. it usually works the first time but then if anyone logs out of the server and trys to log back in i get:
[code]Clienthandler: accepted from #################################
Clienthandler: rejected from #################################[/code]

i also get the &quot;no response from server&quot; buisness.
i hope its not the server because i like it how it is and i HATE kzar servers. I have done so much as i have added silab items to it twice because they changed after the first time -.-

its really irritating!</description>
