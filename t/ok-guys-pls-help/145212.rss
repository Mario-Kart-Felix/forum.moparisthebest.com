    <description>ok, can someone help me, i have no idea of how to code clients, and all that shit... can someone post in a simple way how to sign a client and how to put it on a website, i rly need it atm! and when i get server up and all that, u will get admin. Right, add me on msn Jobba333@hotmail.com or just speak to me over here... thanks.

In other ways : if you just put the client up it wont run, i need to make it a .jar file and sign it so it can load from my website</description>
