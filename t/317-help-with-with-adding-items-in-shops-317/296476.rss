good question is that why???[quote author=Epic Ancient link=topic=392470.msg2922058#msg2922058 date=1250813325]<br>
If you’re running a 317, why did you get the code from the 508 database? :s<br>

<p>Download a shop maker… (One is in Allstarscape)[/quote]</p>
<p>Nope. I use allstarscapev2 source, and it’s not there.<br>
You can google it, or search (on the forums here) zodiac’s id &amp; tools list pack 3.0</p>
<p>I downloaded his Pack to get a shopmaker, though it’s of no use because it has a minor flaw.</p>
