    <description>So, I followed this tutorial 

[url=http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/tutorials/246259-how-stop-new-players-trading-certain-time-pi.html]New player Trading [PI][/url]

But it must not be compatible with my server and the time is all messed up and it resets etc, so i incorporated it with Public void process in client but its obviously executed a lot faster. How often is it executed so i can modify the time they have to wait to drop trade and pk.</description>

I see, so basically as long as you call the class and method it doesn’t matter, might put it in playerassistant then. thanks for your help</p>
<p>So this would take away 1 every second? I don’t need to call the method from elsewhere?</p>
<p><code>	        public void tradeTimer() {

You should call the method when the player first logs in (So initialize in client.java).<br>
And based on your code, you’re never ending the event.</p>
<p><code>	        public void tradeTimer() {
                EventManager.getSingleton().addEvent(new Event() {

				c.trade11 = -1;
				c.sendMessage("Your beginners protection has ended, you may now trade.");
				timer.stop();

<p>You don’t <span class="bbcode-u">have</span> to put it in client.java, I’ve never understood why everyone thinks that. You put it in the class it fits with. You wouldn’t want to put item handling code in PlayerHandler, because that just wouldn’t make sense.</p>

<p>Confused a bit now. So you’re saying i shouldnt use process for the timer?

Yes that is what I’m saying.<br>
The timer doesn’t need to be executed every 600 milliseconds.</p>
<p>I’d use events to make it execute every second, or even every minute.</p>
