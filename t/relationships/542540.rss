<p>Exactly what happened in my relationship to be honest. I am now wise and experienced haha.</p>
<p>But ya I was absolutely perfect to her (I know every guy thinks they are a good boyfriend but I always went the extra mile) and never was anything but nice/lovely too her, and she basically said “I don’t this anymore”. It was brutal as fudge and cut me deep but now that I look back on it I know I am better off without her, so OP you will feel better in time.</p>
<p>However, if you want my honest advice - don’t do the beta shit. There is nothing beta about being completely honest how you feel, but don’t fudge around with it. Say what you need to say to her, say how you feel, as raw as you can, and if nothing comes of it move on. You will come out of it a better and stronger person, take it from my word of experience.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I’m going on 5 months now but I think I was lucky, the BF she had before me was a total asshat and tried to use her and was just a douche in general. Squinted indoors, always tried to look like a hollister model, asked for anal (lol’d irl, strong homo deep down) and nudes 2 days in. Glad he didn’t get shit</p>
<p>Since I came along she now has a contrast between the two, it also probably helps that I look like a douche. She gets all the visual perks without the personality.</p>
<p>But i’d never go the extra mile. I operate on a meet halfway basis, if I feel like im the one holding it together then I’d rather not have it at all. I’d say if you have to put much more effort into your half to keep her happy thats the first sign somethings not clicking. Except of course the things you did to cause her being unhappy, like other girls with their own brains looking at me is my fault  :rolleyes:[/quote]<br>
Oh, don’t get me wrong, I know that now. It was my first relationship and I still thought that the nice guys won, hahah.</p>

Exactly what happened in my relationship to be honest. I am now wise and experienced haha.</p>
<p>But ya I was absolutely perfect to her (I know every guy thinks they are a good boyfriend but I always went the extra mile) and never was anything but nice/lovely too her, and she basically said “I don’t this anymore”. It was brutal as fuck and cut me deep but now that I look back on it I know I am better off without her, so OP you will feel better in time.</p>
<p>However, if you want my honest advice - don’t do the beta shit. There is nothing beta about being completely honest how you feel, but don’t fuck around with it. Say what you need to say to her, say how you feel, as raw as you can, and if nothing comes of it move on. You will come out of it a better and stronger person, take it from my word of experience.</p>
