    <title>Senior Year; USMC Bound</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/senior-year-usmc-bound/396533</link>
    <description>As summers yearns closer and closer, i begin to think about my future and my family.
These past few months i have decided to join the USMC (United States Marines Corps) because they are the most respected and most feared force in the US military naval. 

Now im sure you know of someone that has joined the marines; or any naval force in fact.
I would just like to know what my future looks like joining the marines and what i should i do in the marines? what job? what contract? I have a specific eye on the marines reserves and studying to become a marine officer.

Positive feedback will be appreciated . 
Thank you moparisthebest community!</description>

              <p>First of all if you plan on making a career out of the military doing the full 20 years for retirement then the marines would be your last choice. If you do want to be an officer then yes i suggest goin into the reserves or some type of national guard so you can earn your degree while serving your time. If you go active it will be much harder to obtain your degree.Whatever your choice is i wish you the best of luck, there is nothing like the brotherhood that you experience in the military.</p>

<p>Quick input on this. Don’t care how long ago this was, if you want a good team of marksmen look at the IRA (Irish Republican Army, not the real army but still) sniper division, signs had to be put up in Northern Ireland to warn people of these snipers because they would NOT miss</p>

Bad thing about snipers is, they aren’t shot and dragged away from the firefight like infantry, they’re usually outnumbered, captured, and tortured.</p>

              <p>As summers yearns closer and closer, i begin to think about my future and my family.<br>
These past few months i have decided to join the USMC (United States Marines Corps) because they are the most respected and most feared force in the US military naval.</p>
<p>Now im sure you know of someone that has joined the marines; or any naval force in fact.<br>
I would just like to know what my future looks like joining the marines and what i should i do in the marines? what job? what contract? I have a specific eye on the marines reserves and studying to become a marine officer.</p>
<p>Positive feedback will be appreciated .<br>
Thank you moparisthebest community!</p>
