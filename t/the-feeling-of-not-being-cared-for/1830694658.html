        <p>i literally joined just so i could say this to you: Suicide is not the option. being around people who do drugs, drink, abuse you [emotionally and physically] is not something that you should do. bottling up your emotions and not trying to get help is not something you should do. i was that way for a while. playing RS was my life. i was failing school and distancing from my friends. i did not know what to do, so i did what anyone should do: I TALKED TO SOMEONE. my counselor suggested joining one of the after school programs. it did not even have to be a sport team. i decided to join a robotics team that all of my old friends were on. being in a social area has changed my life. i’m way more active. i work out. i enjoy my friends, and they enjoy me. The best thing YOU can do: just talk with someone like a parent, grandparent, or your counselor if you don’t feel that you are able to speak with any of your family.<br>
it has been said above me, but quitting WoW would be one of the first steps to opening yourself up to more time [[i limited all of my internet time to a total of 1 hour per day]], as time allows you to do your homework and get better in school, workout and become more physically active, and learn to enjoy other activities, whether it’s a sport or some extracurricular activity [robotics for me]<br>
suicide is definately not the best option. it ruins lives and leads to way more troubles.<br>
also, while you may get more and debately more relatable opinions, the internet is never a place to start or talk about things like this. i understand why you started it though. it was several internet friends who convinced me to change my life.<br>
i hope you take my advice. see you in the real world</p>

</aside>
<p>This.</p>
<p>You will eventually come to terms with the fact that not everybody you meet in life is going to like you. A good amount of the people you meet are going to think you’re a nobhead. Of the ones that don’t, the MAJORITY, yes, I said MOST OF THEM do not give two shits about you, do not want to listen to you and basically don’t even notice you. It’s a shame. But you do the same to them.</p>
<p>Stop caring about what people think who have forgotten your existence 5 seconds after you walk out of the room. This is the key to killing off social anxiety/shyness/whatever.</p>
<p>As for the lack of social interaction or whatever, you need to figure out whether it’s an actual fear of going out (it might not be obvious, agoraphobia is a sneaky one) or just a lack of people to go out with. If the former, seek help. Now. Trust me on this one. If the latter, shit, open up a book on activities in your town, pick one at random, and join it. You never know, basket weaving could be fucking awesome, and even if it isn’t, I bet theres some smoking hot girls that think it is.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about WoW, keep rockin’ it if you enjoy it. People who say WoW causes despression or bad social life are, to put it simple, “fucking stupid”. WoW is a pasttime like any other as you said, it just happens to be one that is fairly attractive to people with a less active social life than average, for obvious reasons… it dosen’t involve going outside and it at least means you get a goal to focus on and people to talk to. It’s harmless.</p>

        <p>I’ll tell you a little story about my life in high school, hopefully it will help.</p>
<p>Entering high school I knew about 10 people, so I was sort of an outcast of sorts as well.  I remember this one kid, who kept harassing me all through freshman year.  He would make fun of me behind my back, and to my face.  He would even get others to make fun of me.  It was hard, but the best way to deal with people like this is to completely ignore them, just smile and keep going about your business.  The key is to not give any indication of them bothering you at all, most people stop at this, some do not.  Anyway, this kid kept pestering me like I said, and we ended up in the same Gym class at the beginning of sophomore year.  The harassment continued until one day I remember fairly well, we were playing hockey and me and this kid were on the same team, he was the goalie and at one point in the game he came up behind me and kicked me as hard as he could right in the middle of my back.  Needless to say this hurt like a sonofabitch and my instantaneous reaction caused me to spin around and break my hockey stick over his arm.</p>
<p>The result of standing up and hitting back?  We both got in trouble, but it was entirely worth it because although we didn’t really like each other, him and others developed respect and maybe even fear of me, knowing that I would fight back if physically provoked.  Towards the end of high school we even grew to almost like each other, and even talked nicely while at school and such, I would even call him a friend, although we didn’t hang out outside of school or anything.</p>
<p>Similar events happened to me throughout grade school as well, the lesson to be learned is to stand up for yourself.</p>
<p>Ignore verbal abuse, but never ignore physical abuse (never start the fight though, take the first hit, deliver the rest) and you will be respected.</p>

        <p>Puberty makes kids go emo. Not ‘emo’ as in .wrists but as in emotional; bipolar (lol). At some points in my life, I feel like I’m hated, and I don’t even belong here. But then I realize I’m overreacting and just call up a friend. Suicide is a fast easy way to end a problem; permanently. And I highly doubt you get a second chance in life, just keep yourself alive.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t feel bad about V-Day, I didn’t have a gf at the time or anyone who fucking cared (too busy making out with their gf/bf).</p>

        <p>The feeling of not being cared for…<br>
Well that sums me up, but I realized that most people didn’t like me but some people ‘loved’ me, when I say loved I mean as a brother, sister, parent or guardian etc. So that cheered me up.</p>
<p>I’m not agreeing with physical violence or anything but that one time if you get it at the time right place you could go from being hated to being ‘loved’ as in friends “he’s awesome!” Being the person I am I have thrown my fists around to much, Yes I have a very short fuse (so to speak :P) and people have learned that, but not the few who haven’t realized it. Only because they to bigged headed about them selfs, their very dumb and don’t give a shit.</p>
<p>My story is similar to mopar’s but different; if you know what I mean. But there was a kid at school. (I’m in year 8; Grade 8, or 8th grade, to what you yanks wanna cool it.This happened in year 5) So there was a kid whos constanly at it, I just ignore it, but sometime it gets to me so I threaten to do something. This makes things worse, so to do one of those things made me feel better [This is not a thing to do] and I carryed out one of those things, I ‘smacked’ ‘punched’ or what ever you want to cal it, right next to his nose (cheek, I missed) when i did it he fell to the floor in shock (I was regarded as a ‘pussy’ ‘weakling’ etc) most people in the class saw it and our teacher didn’t say anything. So the point was things like this have made me less hated. we did get along together as time went on but now hes moved to Australis, MATE!</p>
<p>Just think about things more (like I do, makes me feel better) this may not be the thing to you but it works for me and people I know, think about things, ask things you don’t understand or don’t know, Ignore the crap that people give you people say bottle it up and then let it go, this is not the thing to do, I broke my hand and someones skull doing that. But anyway just ignore it and let it out in activity’s that you enjoy, join clubs or just potter around the house doing things, go out on your own if it enjoys you. If you get the piss taken out of you then let it out in what you enjoy. Don’t find things that comfort it but its still there.</p>
<p>So in conclusion (never thought I would say this) But ignore it, then let it out. Hoped I helped you.</p>
<p>Oh one last thing people whoh use the term ‘emo’ for depression and things just fuck the hell off! (ignore it if you like but you know I said it, you know that its here!!!) [did that just counter act what I just said -eh take it into account</p>

        <p>Well then turn that attitude around.<br>
Start caring for yourself and your body, once you feel you look nice, you gain confidence and portray a better personality and character.</p>
<p>So, try exercising, drinking plenty of water and considering a diet or something for the weight.<br>
Stop playing WoW if it’s consuming your life and are sick of it.<br>
Talk to more people, make tons of small talk and such. Try and make more friends.</p>
<p>Anddd, yeah.<br>
Don’t commit suicide, not when you haven’t really tried to turn around your life.</p>
<p>I kind of just got out of this phase… although it was mostly caused by my stupid boyfriend.<br>
Anyway, good luck.</p>

<p>More seriously, you have created the most serious thread in a long, long time on the forum that has expressed alot of maturity from our members who would otherwise troll.</p>
<p>You’re clearly a good people person, you don’t need to be the most popular guy in school, keeping just a few close friends who you go out with on a regular basis is the best way to enjoy yourself. large gangs just lead to drugs, violence etc as Thug-life said.</p>
<p>Don’t try and quit WoW. Instead, take up a time consuming hobby - something you will really enjoy and can put time into, eventually that hobby will force you into cutting down and eventually quitting your eLife (so to speak).</p>
<p>12 Months ago I went through a similar depression, however it was due to physical reasons, I was under performing at sport. Then I had my op, for the past 6 months I haven’t been allowed to do anything but sit on my arse and do nothing. It’s been depressing, annoying etc etc but now I’m allowed to train again, and all of a sudden I’m happy.</p>
<p>Basically start doing something really enjoyable &amp; keep a few close friends to go out with in your spare time. You’ll emotionally heal up in no time.</p>

<p>I think if you post something like that then you should just fuck off, we could, i’m saying could be dealing with someones life, posting things like medical help is not good on these forums, what is someone say I have cramps in my stomach, most people would say go to the doctor but then you get a few twats like you saying ‘i think you should kill yourself’ or ‘it’ll be fine now fuck off’ So then the person thinks ahh fine it’ll go away, bang next week that person dies of stomach cancer or something, parents would be devistated friends family, they would find out why the son/daughter didn’t tell anyone, they look over here and see someone like you saying bad things. So then they take legual action against you and or even Mopar, just Fuck straight off.</p>
