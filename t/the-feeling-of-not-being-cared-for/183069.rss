    <title>The feeling of not being cared for</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-feeling-of-not-being-cared-for/183069</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;m almost done high school, and good I&#39;m really glad. Over the past two years, I&#39;ve gained lots of weight, about 40 pounds because I&#39;ve seen no real reason to live, or care for my own body. I&#39;m not what you would call good looking, not really ugly. I&#39;m not all that strong either. None of my friends really like me and I havn&#39;t attended a social event like parties for the longest time. I had a girlfriend but we broke up a long time ago. Now, I&#39;m just this loser who sits and plays WoW private servers and goes on MITB, however im not addicted to WoW. I have decent marks in some places and I usually get B&#39;s and A&#39;s. Now, a few friends are legit and actually are my friends, but they have stopped talking to me as of late. I spend numerous hours feeling bad for myself and have considered suicide. I&#39;ve also forgotten about my religion and have really stopped following it. A little while back was Valentines day, which truely made me realize, no one cared, likes or even knows me. 

Should i kill myself?Should i write about this (as if anyone would care)? Or should I start writing my will and what possesions i want to give away? please give mature response and give reasons for your answer. (im not joking about this BTW.)</description>

Pretending not to care doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Actually not caring, on the other hand… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p>So if some kids made fun of you in front of your freinds you would ignore it?<br>
That just makes it worse because they will think your just afraid to stand up for yourself and you take to much shit.</p>
<p>Exactly, don’t let what people say bother you at all and they will stop.[/quote]</p>

              <p>As said before, just try to get in sync better with your friends. Also, try getting into sports or something that gets you moving, cause you can bet people would start noticing you and treating you better if you took better care of youself in the first place. I was feeling the same way around the beginning of summer, but then I got into the whole high school football/weight lifting thing.</p>

              <p>just be sure not to look at the ground, it makes you feel like shit after about 30 seconds of walking and looking at the ground. The best thing is to be doing something while you are walking, eg texting, calling someone, talking to someone, watching a movie on your phone (not listening to music, that doesn’t use your brain enough and makes you feel even more like shit.</p>

<p>You don’t want it, you need it. Don’t just think about,but concentrate on how your life would be with friends that care for you.<br>
You also need to believe it can come true, it’s not like a simple daydream.You need to imagine and believe it over and over again.</p>
<p>I’ll give you an example. I was on MSN and the girl i used to like came online. So i thought i should test this Law of Attraction and see if it actualy works. I sat there without any music and i imagined how it would be if she said anything to me on MSN. I imagined i was sitting there on my chair and i heard the little sound that MSN makes when someone starts to talk to you and that it was her name on the MSN window. I did this over and over again.<br>
After like 5? minutes she actualy said something to me. I hadn’t seen her in a year or talked to her for about a month. And now suddenly she just said something to me. I wasn’t as happy as i imagined , i was kind of shocked. I really didn’t thought it would work. Since that day my life changed. Now im talking about something silly like MSN but imagine what great things you can achieve !! I know this may sound stupid talking about MSN but once you experience it yourself a whole new world will open for you.</p>
<p>Try it, and with enough determination you WILL succeed.<br>

              <p>I dont know if the guy’s problem is solved or not but i’ll give you some advice that made my life a lot more interesting.<br>
I hope you appreciate my comment cause normally i should’ve been studying but i had an urge to write this reply.</p>
<p>About a month ago, i was really bored from everything. Going to school everyday , doing the same stuff everyday.<br>
I dont want to brag about my self but my life was good. The only problem was that my life was too boring.<br>
So i was surfing the internet and i dont know how i got there but then i saw it.<br>
“Law of Attraction.”<br>
I dont know if you heard about this but it changed my view on life.<br>
I did more research on this and i even watched the movie : “The Secret” to understand more about it.<br>
My life became a whole lot more interesting. I began to think that i’m the God of my own life.<br>
Every time i prayed for something, i didnt pray to god, i prayed to myself.<br>
I dont want to/dont have the time to explain what the “Law of attraction” is<br>
Do some research about it, and i’ll explain it to those who are interested tommorow.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, cause i know it helped me.<br>
(Probably the reason i took the time to register and write a reply was because you wished your life would be better , and here i am giving you some advice  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )<br>
Just remember to think positive about everything and imagine the life you would want to have in your head.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>Go try to find some new friends, it will be hard though, especially in high school. Remember, if you still have good friends STRENGTHEN YOUR RELATION with them! Hopefully they will be the best to re-communicate with. You will need to make some changes too. try looking for some more friends whom share similar interests. Try not to let images bother you either, its JUST HIGH SCHOOL! The people you dislike, will be gone eventually, however, the people closest to you will stick.</p>
<p>Here is a wise saying.</p>
<p>To change yourself, you must first change your thoughts. Thoughts will form actions, actions will form habits, habits are a reflection of yourself.</p>

Do people realize that the people who ‘ignore verbal abuse’ get abused more… because people thinks its funny…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Actually it is the opposite.  If you respond to verbal abuse that makes it funny and you will get abused more, if you ignore it and show no reaction then it isn’t funny and it stops.</p>
<p>But again, don’t take physical abuse, fight back. :)[/quote]</p>
<p>I dunno… if they ignore you then they will just try harder to get a reaction. Cuz I remember when we used to always pick on this kid in that same way…</p>

<p>But again, don’t take physical abuse, fight back. :)[/quote]In the current day and age, when people verbally abuse a selected victim, if they fight back or not, they’ll continue until they absolutly have to stop. They’ll gang up on the victim and make him feel worse and worse. If he were to fight back, he’d have to deal with the stupidity of not only the group in front of him, but everything he says they’ll laugh at causing another group to come and laugh at him.</p>
<p>I know quite a few people who deal with verbal abuse every day of their lives. I help some of 'em, because I hang out with most of the people in the school, and everybody is cool with me. But I’m not everywhere, yano?</p>
