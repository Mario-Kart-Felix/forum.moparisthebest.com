    <title>Reflection Rsps adding commands help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reflection-rsps-adding-commands-help/528527</link>
    <description>[font=georgia] Hello,
I was just wondering on how I would add a &#39;npc&#39; or &#39;pure&#39; Command into the reflection cheat client, As im new to coding and i dont understand it enough to add anything to it, would anyone know how to add these commands or something similar? (for pure/ master make stats go up alot, some servers will have this im only asking for this becuase of some dont, And npc to spawn npc direcltly like the object code)

Thanks :)[/font]</description>
