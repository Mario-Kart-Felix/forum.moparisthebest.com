    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/basic-thing-which-i-have-no-clue-how-to-do/22494</link>
    <description>All I need is a quick reply on how to do this, don&#39;t tell me i am a noob or go search, because i have and they aren&#39;t working. I just need someone to type some php code because i am making a jukebox list and all i want to do is have it go to like http://www.whatever.com/music/music.php?music-id=banana and then it would have a the code to where it would be like &lt;embed src = $music-id &amp; &quot;.mid&quot; loop = &quot;true&quot; autostart = &quot;true&quot; &gt; because it has parse errors and in html it just shows a X box, thankyou for your cooperation. :)</description>
