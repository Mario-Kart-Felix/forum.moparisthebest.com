    <description>Okay, So Here&#39;s What Gets To Me. Everytime Something Useful That Isn&#39;t Fully Explained Gets Posted in Tutorials, It&#39;s Removed. Theres Always The Forum Brat Saying &quot;TROLOL THIS IS A SNIPPET!!!&quot;. Why? Nobody Ever Checks The Snippets and Nobody Cares To. They Want An Actual Thread Where They Can View People&#39;s Comments on The Threads ETC. So Why Forums People, Do You Troll The Snippet Tutorials? Because They&#39;re Not an Actual Tutorial? 

TUTORIAL
Something that provides special, often individual instruction, especially:
a. A book or class that provides instruction in a particular area.
b. Computer Science A program that provides instruction for the use of a system or of software.

The Snippet is &quot;Information&quot; Given To A Person So They Can Do Something For Their Server. Why Would That Not Be a Tutorial?</description>

              <p>It gets technical, here on mopar, a snippet is a <span class="bbcode-b">small</span> bit of code, which can’t be explained all that well, since it’s so small.<br>
a tutorial is a rather large bit of code, with careful explanation, and good documentation.</p>
<p>Somethings acceptable as tutorials would be, if matching the description above, a combat system, <span class="bbcode-b">how to</span> complete certain tasks using certain implementations, etcetera. A skill or something is more of a snippet because you’re not teaching somebody how to do something, just telling him to copy and paste your code, he really isn’t learning anything from your tutorial.</p>
<p>Don’t put a command that’s “well explained” in the tutorials section. Oh, and OP, quit being a faggot.</p>
