    <title>[07] What do you think of their final decision?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/07-what-do-you-think-of-their-final-decision/500894</link>
    <description>I feel this needs a new thread since the other one primarily dealing with the 07 vote is more or less just dealing with issues regarding payment confusion, if a mod feels like it feel free to merge the topics.

So, what are your views? I feel Jagex are finally coming back to their players, or at least the veteran players. I cannot explain how much Jagex have seriously changed my opinion of them this past month or so, they&#39;ve been incredible. I [b]never[/b] thought Jagex would or could come back and give us something such as this, but they have, and they haven&#39;t dragged it out either. They&#39;ve been completely transparent with us as players and they actually seem very enthusiastic about this themselves. I&#39;m incredibly surprised at their decision to keep it to just the members fee for 6 months, it seems they&#39;ve taken a whole new look on the RS community. Or at least that&#39;s what I think, what about you?</description>

Yes, I played back then, but I never came across anyone like that. Everyone I played with was in it for the sheer enjoyment.<br>

What are you saying lol? We’re all in it for the sheer enjoyment or we wouldn’t be playing the game…[/quote]<br>
Fails, what are you on about? People made bank crafting nats back in the day, they only grinded rc for that reason: to get rich.</p>

No, not everyone is playing for the sheer enjoyment. As of right now, everyone is playing to be the best.[/quote]<br>
No they aren’t and I honestly don’t think you can comment on the matter after only played for 30 minutes as opposed to a lot of members who have agreed with me and myself having racked up upwards of 40 hours playing so far at least. You can’t possibly get the feel for the game and the way the community is acting just because you’ve seen people are proud of their highscores lol <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

They needed something draw players back in, and since everyone, or most everyone, enjoyed the '07 era of RS they thought it could be the solution to all of their problems.

<p>This is just my opinion on the matter. :([/quote]</p>
<p>Pretty much this, they saw a great money making opportunity with the low player count and the majority of the RS community wanting an older version of the game.</p>

<p>What pServs generally do is take the taspects we like from the real game and put them together and leave out the aspects we don’t like. I think that’s what it should be like - everyones opinion that doesn’t agree with me cause most of them are like ITS MEANTZ TO BE OLDSKOOLZ or LOLZ DONT MAKE IT SLIGHTLY EASIERZZ CUZ ITLL SUPERZ EAZY or  THEIR WERE NO UPDATEZ SINCE 2007 THAT ARE WORTH PUTTING INTO THE SERVER etcetc…</p>

<p>It’s because people these days are picky as love and rage when they don’t get what they want. Which is why there are so many loveing riots in Falador when the smallest changes happen. Like really, you’re not being forced to play the game.[/quote]</p>
<p>We only hit 449k Votes, Jagex is sorry, They want money thats all, As they said, if the 07 community doesnt keep rising within 6months but downfalls instead, membership will be charged, thats because they make no money within the 6months for everybody renewing membership. I wouldnt play EoC and im not gonna play 07, I hate jagex either way.</p>

Did you actually play back then lol? Everyone played to become rich and everyone wanted to be high on the highscores, there’s people who are also in it for questing. If you played you’d realise that, you can’t really have a proper view of it if you’ve only played for 30 minutes but hundreds of people quest and run questing groups, they’re in it for the adventure.</p>
