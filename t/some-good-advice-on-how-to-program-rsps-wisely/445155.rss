    <description>[u][b]Description:[/b][/u] I will show you some ways on how to keep your code very clean, and give you advice on some programming habits.

[center][size=14pt][b]Keeping code clean
[/b][/size][/center]
In PI sources, you will always see dirty code.  There are ways to clean up this code with not much trouble and quick learning.

First, let&#39;s go over what is dirty code and what is clean.

[size=10pt]Dirty:[/size]
[code=java]
    public void totallevelsupdate() {
	int totalLevel = (getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[0])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[1]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[2])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[3]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[4])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[5]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[6])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[7]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[8])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[9]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[10])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[11]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[12])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[13]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[14])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[15]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[16])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[17]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[18])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[19]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[20])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[21]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[22]));
	sendFrame126(&quot;Levels: &quot; + totalLevel, 13983);
    }
[/code]
Code like this is very ugly and should never ever turn into a habit.  This code could be simplified into a few lines, seeing as there is a certain pattern to all the incrementing.  If there is ever a constant pattern that you can very well simplify, then you should always do so.

It could simplify into this easily.

Clean:
[code=java]
    public void totallevelsupdate() {
	int total = 0;
	for(int slot = 0; slot &lt; 22; slot++) {
	    total += getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[slot]);
	}
	sendFrame126(&quot;Levels: &quot; + total, 13983);
    }
[/code]


You should always keep in mind that another programmer, someday, will always see your code and you want to impress that programmer as much as you can as well as keeping the same outcome of the code.  Conventions are also very very important to other programmers, or newcomers.  I suggest you read this link under if you do not understand what conventions are completely.
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html

There are many more examples that I can explain about, but at the moment I cannot think of any others.


[center][size=14pt][b]Bad programming habits:[/b][/size][/center]

I will always see a ton of code in one method piled up like crazy.  If you can, you should always try to use an array to store some of that data to make it less confusing.  You also should always try to stay away from unnecessary looping, or if your code can be stopped right then and there, but continues throughout the method, you should avoid this and always stop if you really do not need to keep going.  You always want your code to not put so much stress on the VM.

Something like this could always be cleaned up or shortened or approached in a different, more effective manner.

You never ever want to hardcode data, unless you really have to.

Hardcode = the manner of a ton of excessive data in one place.

[size=12pt][b]Example:[/b][/size]
[code=java]
    private static int[][] xEP = { { 14882, 1 }, { 14881, 1 }, { 14877, 1 },

This is a very bad example, indeed.  This is also a bad habit that some people seem to pick up from other new programmers.

Thank you very much for your time in reading my tutorial.  I have not written a tutorial in a long time, so please let me know if I left anything important out.  I am open to any good/hateful comments.  None of the code here is mine, with the exception of the second method posted.</description>

It was merely an example that I took off a random source on my computer.  But it could also serve as a bad example and an addition to bad habits.</p>

In PI sources, you will always see dirty code.  There are ways to clean up this code with not much trouble and quick learning.</p>
<p>First, let’s go over what is dirty code and what is clean.</p>
<p>[size=10pt]Dirty:[/size]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    public void totallevelsupdate() {
	int totalLevel = (getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[0])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[1]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[2])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[3]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[4])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[5]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[6])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[7]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[8])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[9]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[10])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[11]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[12])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[13]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[14])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[15]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[16])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[17]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[18])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[19]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[20])
		+ getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[21]) + getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[22]));
	sendFrame126("Levels: " + totalLevel, 13983);
    }</code></pre>
<p>Code like this is very ugly and should never ever turn into a habit.  This code could be simplified into a few lines, seeing as there is a certain pattern to all the incrementing.  If there is ever a constant pattern that you can very well simplify, then you should always do so.</p>
<p>It could simplify into this easily.</p>
<p>Clean:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    public void totallevelsupdate() {
	int total = 0;
	for(int slot = 0; slot &lt; 22; slot++) {
	    total += getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[slot]);
	}
	sendFrame126("Levels: " + total, 13983);
    }</code></pre>
<p>You should always keep in mind that another programmer, someday, will always see your code and you want to impress that programmer as much as you can as well as keeping the same outcome of the code.  Conventions are also very very important to other programmers, or newcomers.  I suggest you read this link under if you do not understand what conventions are completely.<br>

<p>There are many more examples that I can explain about, but at the moment I cannot think of any others.</p>
<p>[center][size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Bad programming habits:</span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>I will always see a ton of code in one method piled up like crazy.  If you can, you should always try to use an array to store some of that data to make it less confusing.  You also should always try to stay away from unnecessary looping, or if your code can be stopped right then and there, but continues throughout the method, you should avoid this and always stop if you really do not need to keep going.  You always want your code to not put so much stress on the VM.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your time in reading my tutorial.  I have not written a tutorial in a long time, so please let me know if I left anything important out.  I am open to any good/hateful comments.  None of the code here is mine, with the exception of the second method posted.</p>
