&quot;The company has been spending millions of dollars in an attempt to stop 5,000 barrels a day gushing into the ocean. Deepwater Horizon, the rig owned and operated by contractor Transocean, sank three weeks ago with the loss of 11 lives. Since then, the cost of BP&#39;s clean-up operation has soared from $350m (£238m) to $450m in just three days.&quot;, &quot;Analysts at Barclays Capital estimate the maximum total cost of the clean-up, plus compensation, legal bills and lost revenue could be $22.6bn.&quot; - [url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/7721076/BP-oil-spill-clean-up-costs-spiral-to-33m-a-day.html]source[/url]</description>

<p>i know that there are other ways of disposing nuclear waste, but you mentioned space as though it was the best method.</p>
<p>and i don’t know what you mean by no one wanting small amounts of waste in a rocket…[/quote]<br>
Oops, I edited my post before I saw your reply. This: “Right, building massive solar panels means huge maintenance. Maintenance isn’t simple (How Do The Do It? gives an idea) - they have to detect the nonworking panel, replace it manually without possibly damage any other panels under the hot sun.”</p>
<p>You mentioned about sending up rockets with relatively small amounts of waste - why would actually anyone send off rockets with minimum waste?</p>

              <p>no, i meant that solar energy is useless because the startup and maintenance costs are not worth the return in energy. if we are in the mood for wasting money, we might as well put it into something more low risk than blasting nuclear waste into the air.</p>
<p>i know that there are other ways of disposing nuclear waste, but you mentioned space as though it was the best method.</p>
<p>and i don’t know what you mean by no one wanting small amounts of waste in a rocket…</p>

Right, building massive solar panels means huge maintenance. Maintenance isn’t simple (<span class="bbcode-i">How Do The Do It?</span> gives an idea) - they have to detect the nonworking panel, replace it manually without possibly damage any other panels under the hot sun.</p>
<p>Surely no one would want small amounts of waste in a rocket. Alternatively, there are other ways to dispose nuclear waste.</p>
