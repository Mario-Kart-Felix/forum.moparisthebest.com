          <blockquote>
              <p>Ok, when you open scar, and pick a colour with the vial thing at the top, it SHOULD at the bottom show either something like this:</p>
<p><code>
(452, 726) Being the X,Y coords you got it from and
57846547  Being the Color you got at those X,Y coords.</code></p>
<p>Now, what to do with those you ask? If you wanted to click on the coords you would do:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Mouse(452,726,3,3,true)</code></pre>
<p>And what to do with the color.</p>
<p>Copy and Paste it to where it says it needs it.</p>
<p>So if you needed the colour of a cow, you would click the vial type thing at the top (green) and click over what you needed.</p>
