    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help/528404</link>
    <description>In response to a recent suggestion concerning the use of IRC for assistance in programming, I&#39;ve created a new channel that is dedicated solely to helping others that join and request assistance.
This channel is called #help, and the main focus for the channel is to provide serious assistance to those in search of help, without the trolling, intimidation or jokes that would follow. Ranks will be assigned to those who are helpful within the IRC and the forums, and those who come to the channel to fool around will be kicked and/or banned. If you&#39;re willing to take part in the experiment and join the channel, then go for it. If there are some things that you don&#39;t want to see in this, or if you don&#39;t want it at all, please say so and explain why. If you have any questions, ask. This way, we can set up the channel in the best way possible infrastructure-wise, and work out the kinks in the idea before the channel becomes more popular.

Some ideas to help the channel, if anyone is willing to create them:

[ul][li]An automated IRC bot that answers generic help questions by providing links and/or answers. Examples can be !question portforward, and the bot would reply with a portforward guide link, while an input such as !question 100errors can answer with &quot;you&#39;ve missed an opening or closing bracket somewhere in your code.&quot;[/li]

              <p>If people just highlight me when someone in <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> needs sorting out, I’ll do it. I just don’t monitor the channel enough (as it is usually pretty dead).</p>
<p>The rules I have enforced on <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> have generally been pretty common sense rules.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t flood the channel</li>
<li>Don’t attempt to trick new users (e.g. “x has sent you a message, type /server message 1 to read it”)</li>
<li>Don’t attempt to disrupt other channels or members. I’ve banned people in the past for people in <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> telling people to go to <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> with their private server questions or telling them to beg others for help (like Mopman). I’ve enforced the latter for a few years now, when I see it, that is.</li>
<li>Just don’t be a dick.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are pretty focused around existing regular members, newer members - it’s a bit more difficult. The most trouble comes from people clicking the irc tab on the forums and just joining under a moparirc_xxxx name and demanding help, not the type to read the rules anyway. Telling them the purpose of the channel and maybe pointing them to the rules is all you can do.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Discussion about what exactly? The rules for <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> that have been there for years? I didn’t realize clarification was needed from everybody to utilize already existing rules (see: <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,446520.0.html">https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,446520.0.html</a>). I think what most are talking about is the lack of these rules being enforced due to how each operator sees the channel, and interprets the rules (see: Rule 1). If so, all this should be viewed as is a group of staff agreeing to enforce the rules in a unified scope and interpret them in the same way which is completely reasonable. Likewise with the forums we don’t force staff to moderate in a specific fashion, some actively share the same style while others don’t.</p>
<p>By rewriting the rules the intention is to make them clearer and more accessible, not introducing any changes to the core of the channel. For the sake of clarity here is the access list which contains Mopar staff:</p>
<p>-ChanServ- Entry Nickname/Host          Role<br>
-ChanServ- ----- ---------------------- ----<br>
-ChanServ- 1     Tom                      Y<br>
-ChanServ- 2     moparisthebest         SOP   Y<br>
-ChanServ- 4     Avail                  SOP  Y<br>
-ChanServ- 5     Ruby                   HOP  Y<br>
-ChanServ- 6     Fat_Cookies            AOP AB<br>
-ChanServ- ----- ---------------------- ----<br>
-ChanServ- End of <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> ACCESS listing.</p>
<p>The above are the staff members with access on <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span>, Y is in favour of rule enforcement, AB is abstinence (or lack of input while present). In short, I’m not changing the rules I’m changing my interpretation of the rules and how they should be enforced which other staff agree with by their own accord. This isn’t as bad is it may sound, it’s merely a bid to chop down tall flowers who are causing all the issues. The channel isn’t going to turn into a concentration camp, and I can assure you most people won’t notice a difference. I appreciate as an active IRC user what the IRC is about and have no intention of drastically changing the environment, which would be unnecessary anyway.</p>
<p>NOTE: This topic is about <span class="hashtag">#help</span>, it’s ended up elsewhere and I don’t intend for it to head even more off topic. If you still want to discuss this then go ahead and contact me, any other subjects belong in other places.</p>

<p>There hasn’t really been much discussion at all, just three staff members saying “these changes are going to happen and we’ve decided it so it’s happening”.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Newty, post:28, topic:528404”]We shouldn’t clamp down on the old channels… They’ve been structured like this forever and it is perfectly fine the way it is. What should happen is a separate channel is created for people who aren’t typically going to be on the IRC. Normally they come on once, don’t register their nick, and never come back. We should leave the rest of the server how it is and create more structure in this help channel. If people want to idle in the other channels after they’ve gotten help on the irc then they can feel free to deal with some joking/trolling just like the rest of us did/have to (I still get shit in <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> &amp; <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span>)</p>
<p>Sorry if that is structured badly… Night shift is killin me!! lol[/quote]<br>
It isn’t perfectly fine the way it is though. I get pms on here, the IRC and Skype from people moaning about how someone was nasty to them on a weekly basis. I know we all or most of us had to wade through the shit of joining both of the channels but that’s gonna be a thing of the past for <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> hopefully. <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> is basically out with any of our control (even moparisthebest) so that’s just gonna be left to go whichever way it wants, it’s not as if <a href="http://mitb.com" rel="nofollow noopener">mitb.com</a> brings any traffic to the IRC anymore other than the old timers that sit in there frequently anyways. Since moparscape is the only active site in our group anymore it makes more sense to rework it and make it more user friendly. Towards your idea of naming the channel for this reform something else, what would it be called? It’s for the discussion and service of general things that <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> is here for currently so why bother with two channels?</p>

[/quote]I really really reallllllly hope this is a joke.[/quote]Not a joke. They’re not going to be as tight as I worded that there but they’re certainly being clamped down on. It isn’t supposed to happen on the forum so why would it in the IRC channel that’s linked directly from the forum? The way myself, Tom and moparisthebest see it (the only people at that meeting) is that it’s an official channel and it should be a relaxed environment for everyone to use, which currently isn’t the case. It’s came to Taharoks eyes as well and he’s said that as a new policy trolls should be kick banned from the channel, it just isn’t fair to all members the way it is right now.</p>

What do you mean without being ridiculed? Did you even read what I said in the post you just quoted? The rules of the <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> channel are being rewritten in a manner that stops trolling and making others feel like second class citizens. People being “ridiculed” is part of the Internet for Christ sake, (inb4 loveandpower leaves for another 9 months because internet bullying is coming into play) it’s just something you deal with. If you make an idiotic thread here you’ll be trolled to the heavens and back yet people still come here again and again. You can’t use that as a reason really, there’s never going to be a completely troll free environment on the internet; especially in an IRC channel.</p>

Just last week I team viewed with a guy to get his client working after he came onto the irc and got trolled by a few members… This is what the purpose of <span class="hashtag">#help</span> is; to get together people who will help the people who actually need help.</p>
<p>We actually used to have a dedicated help iirc channel at one point but clearly that has long been gone.</p>

<p>They must’ve magically increased 3 fold in the last week then because I barely ever see it happening. Trolling is going to become an offence worthy of punishment in there soon anyway, or whenever Tom sorts out some structured IRC rules. We briefly discussed that when he was rearranging the access list not too long ago so you’ll see it change when the rules emerge, since it is after all an official channel. Although all officialness beside, do you really think one person a day is enough to warrant it’s own channel?<br>

Do you really think that it requires that much manpower to maintain a channel of this nature? <span class="hashtag">#help</span> is meant as a completely voluntary way to ask for help on the IRC channel without being ridiculed. Unless I’m missing the point of you saying that, I don’t see why having a new, completely voluntary channel is such a problem.[/quote]Nobody is saying it’s a problem, they are saying it’s not going to be as useful as you think it is…</p>
