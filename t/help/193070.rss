    <description>Ok well, I&#39;m starting on thinking about making my third server now. I trashed the second one due to it not being what I wanted it to be. Sorry guys.  :( Anyway, I&#39;ve been looking around for oh...I don&#39;t know...two or three days now? Trying to find a decent or well coded Pure Pking Server Source. I can&#39;t seem to find any. If anyone has one, or can make one, or can even direct me towards one. Post on here or add my msn. xtgscott@hotmail.com


Thanks guys, really appreciate it.  :D</description>
