    <description>Problem:Imposter

Ok, I had an imposter come into my server saying he was the server owner.  He was clearly NOT the owner because I asked him some questions and they were wrong. ONE PROBLEM. they have the same IP address. SO either It was REALLY the owner, or he hacked into something to change his address..I dont no.</description>
