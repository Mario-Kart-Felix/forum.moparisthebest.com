<li>when u have multiple computers in your house most ppl hav a router, it splits up the cable in more connections(so u can put more comps on internet) maybe u dont even hav a router, as sumone in yous house(they can explain better <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</li>
<li>computer/gateway adress is internal, internet extern<br>
3&amp;4. client that connects to mopar?ther is no such thing as a moparscape server, you have to make it connect to myour server(simply put the ip in the box, lol)</li>
<li>start-&gt;run-&gt;type cmd, press enter-&gt;type ipconfig/all and press enter</li>
<li>see 5</li>
<li>yup. look in pirvate server hacking section</li>
<li>yup. the source is the server itself, and u can use a client to connect to it.</li>
