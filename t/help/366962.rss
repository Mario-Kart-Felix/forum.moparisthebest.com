    <description>I have a Airscape Source, I downloaded it from moparscape, and it came with a client, however, I suck at trying to get clients to work so that why here.. So if i wanted other players to connect to my server with this client all i would have to do is change this? &lt;blockquote&gt;Gui.server = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, &quot;[b]New Server IP[/b]: &quot;, &quot;[b]New Server IP[/b]&quot;, 1);
if(Gui.server != null &amp;&amp; Gui.server != &quot;&quot;){
anInt833 = 2;
            
            
        }}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Change that to my server IP then could people be able to connect?
Edit: This in [i][b]Client.Java[/b][/i]</description>
