    <description>I keep playing on servers for a while and I&#39;ll make a high lvl account with good stuff... Sometimes I will disconnect and lose my items + stats and have to restart...

I can never get back on a server that I have lvled up on ... like one day I&#39;ll play on a server and get a high lvl... then the next day, or a few days later, I&#39;ll try to play on the same server again and I can&#39;t connect.

Sorry if I&#39;m not making this clear, but its really annoying that I can&#39;t play on an account over a few days.  If someone can help me I&#39;ll be very appreciative.</description>

              <p>Thats the servers fault. The owner also may be deleting all the accounts to save space on their computer. Since you can do absolutely nothing at all to change the situation, I suggest you don’t try.</p>
