              <p>Hey there buddy.  The first thing I’m going to say is;Don’t double+ post, it’s against the rules.  Otherwise, here’s the answer to you’re question.  When you try to login to a server and it says something like;“The server is down” it means that the server is down (another term for offline, therefor “up” means online) then it means that the server is offline.  If this happens, I recommend that you try a minute later and then if you still can’t seem to gain access to the server, you should try another.  I see you’ve already found the server status page, here is another page which has literally thousands of servers.</p>
