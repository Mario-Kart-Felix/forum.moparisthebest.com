    <description>OK guys &quot;mods&quot; if you want us to make it ourselves there is no point in making a server help category. This won&#39;t help us if you keep locking them. Its other people helpin other people. It should be called Server No help becuase of the lack of chance to help some1. It is not like there re any tuts on this stuff that we need helkp with anyway. If u want us to stop make us some more tuts if your so good at codin</description>

<p>Exactly. You don’t get to be a professional sports player without lots of practice, effort, and time. Its the same thing with <span class="bbcode-b">programming</span> (not coding). You have to first learn the basics yourself, and then build on that. You wouldn’t complain to your coach would you?</p>

<p>Here’s an idea:<br>
Actually <span class="bbcode-i">try</span> to do it yourself, maybe ask for a few ideas on how to get started if you’re absolutely clueless, and then ask questions about the problems you encounter when you’re working on it.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Miss Silabsoft, post:1, topic:202972”]When you ask a question, pretend we are seven-year-old kids (that’s very easy to do as most of you guys are) that have no idea what’s going on. That’s how much you’ll have to explain. When asking the question, you must clearly ask it, just like Silabsoft said. This means use proper grammer and spelling, as this makes our job easier, and make sure you’re question is understandable.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll have to show us what you’ve already done. <span class="bbcode-b">THIS IS A MUST!</span> If we want to get anywhere as a community, [size=20pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">we’re going to have to quit the spoon-feeding.</span></span></span>[/size] So if you ask something like “how do I get food healing to work” and show us no previous attempts, you’re not going to get an answer. You may be wondering how a question like this is considered bad. Well, the question asker did not make an attempt to solve the problem him or herself, and is indirectly asking the same question as “tell me how to get food healing work so I can continue my effortless server.” So, remember, <span class="bbcode-b">show us what you’ve done, what you’ve tried to do, or what you think may work.</span></p>
<p>After you have all of that, you’ll have to identify the problem. Its not our job to add your snippet into our own servers and test it for any inconveniences, its YOURS. Usually, its a compilation problem, and it can be solved very easily by glancing at the JavaDocs. Something like <span class="bbcode-i">NullPointerException</span> can be found by typing <span class="bbcode-i">NullPointerException java.sun</span> in the Google search bar. This will return results with links to the JavaDocs about your problem.</p>
<p>Remember, this is just the bare minimum. Try and keep your questions as elaborate as possible. This will benefit yourself and the community as a whole, as you will be learning in the process and we will be able to help solve your problem faster.</p>
<p>Edit: Seeing as most of you think this is a joke, warnings will now be handed out if you disobey this.[/quote]<br>
Can you see it? Its teh fine print.</p>
