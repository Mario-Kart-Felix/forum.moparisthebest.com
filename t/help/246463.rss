Please don&#39;t tell me to go into client.java and change the code&#39;s x and y teles, I would if there was a command for it. Is there anyway I can change it in Player.java if there is could someone help me. Also I am trying to change the colors of some of the items, but I know I need a client and an Item dump &gt; I have a client it is just the dump part is there any1 I can get one. Could I make a notepad file and just through some codes in there, and then place it in my server file. PLease help thank you.</description>

              <p>If you’re using Deltascape, the teleports are located in the clickingMost class, although the teleports are random so you won’t find them by their coordinates, but by their action button id’s.</p>
