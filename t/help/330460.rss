    <description>Usually, i would be on my pc, and i already have variables there. But know, im not on my own pc.  Will there happen something if i set the variables? And maybe the real owner needs cmd, and i know u cant use cmd after u set the variables. BTW, is there maybe a way to fix that?</description>
