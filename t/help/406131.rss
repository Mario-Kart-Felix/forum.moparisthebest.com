    <description>Okay, so I followed THIS tut for Delta scape.

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,444519.0.html#post_delta

After doing it, my client does not connect. 

And seeing in the clientHandler.java [server sided] the UID = 0, but no where in the signlink was UID declared... There was other things in there to declare a UID but nothing saying it&#39;s 0, so when I added my numbers, it just didn&#39;t want to work. :/

Any help?

Also, the client is still with the UID that I put. And the clienthander.java was changed back to 0 and it is working just fine. O.o Since the client is different from the server, should the client not be able to connect to the server? O_____O</description>

<p>I have the orrignal client for the server. But in the signlink.java I add the UID number, and all that. But I also change it server sided. And it just doesn’t want to log in. As if the UID is still nod different via Client side. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

              <p>are you using the client that comes with the source?, or the client he is using, blocking cheating clients is basically making it so you can only use one client, and he probably has a client he set this up to, you will have to know what codes to change and where to change it (basic knowledge of java) gl</p>
