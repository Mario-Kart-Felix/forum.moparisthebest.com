    <description>ok on most clients the tabs are in this lineup

&gt;top:attack type tab,stats,tab,questtab,inventory tab,equip tab,prayer tab,magic tab
&gt;bottom:(some have clanchat tab), friends tab, ignore list tab, logout,the rench looking thing tab, emote tab,

most have music tab but it doesnt do anything when you click on it, now i was wondering how would you edit the placement of these tabs like if i wanted them across the top of the client or the bottom or something. i have my own client so i pretty much figured it would be client die. any help will be apreciated.</description>
