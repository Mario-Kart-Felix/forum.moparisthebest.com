    <description>My ask is how I can get my server online for peeps.
I HAVE A MODEM NOT A ROUTER!
I have portforwarded but I don&#39;t know if I need that and of I did it good see doc. for picture.
I have added a port 43594 see doc. for picture
My no-ip works see doc. for picture.
When I go to moparisthebest.com/serverstatus and registrer my serverip k0scape.no-ip.biz it says your server is offline but I can still play on it.

OK REMEMBER I HAVE A MODEM AND I DON&quot;T KNOW IF I CAN HOLD AN SERVER WHEN I HAVE A MODEM.
PLEASE SEND SOME INFORMATION!!!
