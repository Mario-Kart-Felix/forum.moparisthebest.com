    <description>Noobiest noob questions!

To: The owner of this forum
Do not delete/send this to another part of the forum! I don’t care what the rules say, but this forum’s heading says “QUESTIONS!” on it. This is help for all of the other noobs in this forum, so PLEASE don’t delete this

Please answer these yourself and don’t tell me to go to a site because it doesn’t help!

1: how can you create a public server?

2: can someone please create a real “Runescape” server with everything there was on the original RuneScape? (Including updates)

3:I downloaded Moparscape and put it on another pc. When I start it, it shows for 3 seconds before it closes again! What should I do?

4: If there are any tutorials on how to make your own public server, then show me the website, or post them here yourself.

5:If I want to pick a certain object up in one of the servers, it doesn’t work. Why?

6: Even if I am not on the Internet, while I play on one of the servers, it says “connection lost”…
