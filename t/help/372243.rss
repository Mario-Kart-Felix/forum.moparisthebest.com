    <description>yeah I know it&#39;s not that much but its literally all I have, OK I need help with a web-client, I uploaded my cache to a direct dl ( fileden ) and put the URL in my client were it goes, I made my client.jar file, and added all the cache methods to my client and redirected my sprites and background to my cache, I pretty much did everything ric914 i think said to do, I tried my desktop client first and it downloaded, unpacked and loaded everything perfectly, I know cause I was able to log on and play around for a few minutes, but when I try it on my webby it downloads and unpacks the client and loads the background and says &quot;connecting to fileserver&quot; but then gets this error &quot;an error occurred whilst loading elitescape&quot; and it goes black :\ if anyone can make it for me and like tape with hyper cam, what their doing, ( so i can update my client) I will gladly pay you the five dollars I have in paypal. BTW my client base is deltascape v16 and I only pulled filestore32 out of it not mprfilestore32 for the cache. K thanks for any help.</description>

              <p>My cache file is 16 MB’s I have a delta v16 base that came with a folder called cache, inside were two other files: File Store 32 and MPR File Store 32, I only pulled out File Store 32, When Jarring my client I pulled out my cache folder, and directed the jarring to my main client folder, which contained all my .class and .java files. My File Store 32 is the cache folder I made into cache.zip.</p>

<p>I bet $20 you’re loading client.jar from the same directory as the cache folder? You probably missed something to do with loading the cache.</p>
