    <description>Hello readers, I seem to have a very minor problem.
I&#39;m not sure if these are &quot;stupid&quot; questions, if they are please do not post an insult or anything like that.
Firstly, all pictures are in the attachments:
On my server, the godswords hit horribly until I raised the &quot;slash&quot; bonus to 300, (Armadyl Godsword). but they still aren&#39;t hitting the usual like in other servers, i&#39;m sure the bonuses in serverss like 2Speced are like 100.
Why is it like this? I&#39;m on the &quot;PwnScape&quot; source.
(The rune c&#39;bow in 2speced is 7 bonus and mines is 400....that only hits around 20...)
Do I have to add a hidden bonus or somehow make it appear less? if so, how?

Next my stand animation for the godswords is that it&#39;s held in 1 hand, like a longsword.
I have read the tutorials and they set the godsword stance a different way, I did it exactly and it still looks like that. The run animation is how it should be.
and also the attack animation, I haven&#39;t the slightest how to change it, it&#39;s like a D2h I think, but in 2Speced it looks different when you hit, if someone could help i&#39;d be grateful.
Thank you. 

Please try to help :confused:</description>
