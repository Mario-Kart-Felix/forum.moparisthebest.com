<p>Incorrect. You do not need to jar a client for it to work properly. It is safer for you as a developer to only give out the jar file (Note that they can be decompiled) instead of the .class files. It will also give you more players (The average user doesn’t know how to create a command line script to run compiled java files). And you do not want to give out the .java files as they are the source files and people can do malicious things with those.</p>
<p>Protip: the BBC code for urls is [url ]. (no space)</p>
