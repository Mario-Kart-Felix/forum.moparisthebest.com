    <description>Well i added a portal in my Pk-Box to go to home.

I was just wondering is there a way the character would have to wait to tele back.

Like they would have to wait 5-10 seconds.

My other question is how would i get an Npc to attack a player when they tele nearby it.

I am using Delta as my Base.

If you could just answer one question im fine with it but im stumped here.
