    <description>i dont know if this is the relivent section for this but mod tharok keeps locking my topics,
its just that i made them programs just for the moparscape comunity, and there development programs
and he also edited the topic saying the details of the program and changed it to say [Doesnt teach anything and isnt a source], but i thought server downloads was a place where i could post my development tools hense it being a download, he did the same to my menu maker and except that one he said broke rule 2, which is no download lists and it wasnt a download list it was a program i made for the community of moparscape can anyone shed some insight into this situation please.</description>
