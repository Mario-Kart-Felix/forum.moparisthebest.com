    <description>Hey, every time I try to play a server it always says error connecting to server. You may just say &quot;the server is down&quot; but this happens when i know my friend is on the server when i get a message saying error connecting to server. This has been happening for a long long long long time and i can only play servers when i go to a friends house. lol. This problem has been happening after i tried to make my own server. I do not wanna make my own server now. I just want this problem fixed so i can play any server i want. If anyone could help that would be great and very much appreciated.
Thanks.
EDIT: Error connecting to server happens on webclients, whenever i download a client it says java is not recognized has an internal or external command/</description>
