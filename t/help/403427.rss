    <description>ok this may be uncommon to say in help but i would like someone to code and host a server for me. i would like to run a server and i know how but my computer is to slow to host one and it I am not knowledged in java. I am not trying to neccessarily be picky but I dont care how much you know about java i would like someone that is mature and is able to have a decent conversation. i think this is asking for help so i am putting it under this section. 

i think i have alot of unique ideas for a server but it needs someone who can help me to allow this to happen. please respond</description>
