    <description>again please, preferably direction to reading material but w/e..

below is a wondrous sequence class. I have been asked to write the three methods below, next, printSequence (which states the result must be printed not stored) and generateStats. We are told generateStats should calculate the sequence in the same way printSequence does, but instead of printing the results should be stored and then all results from the sequence must have the highest number and the number of results returned as &#39;max&#39; and &#39;length&#39;.

Im stumped how i should be catching each number in the sequence and comparing it using the concept i currently use in printSequence (which does what it should). I should be comparing against the last stored value and store if higher? or should i be creating an array of the sequence and then examining the array for the required values?

sorry for rambling, its late. As i said reading direction would be great
