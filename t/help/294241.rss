    <description>I did this topic before but got no answers so i have changed the name of the project lol.

I have a few problems and help about what i would like to do,

1, I have no-ip,server and client running and i have changed all of the server ip and ports but i only can log into local host not the server ip so i gather no one else can log in,I have also portforward.

2,i was on the server having a look round and i was wondering if there was a way you can like change home from Edgvill to lets say dragnor village i think thats the name, i cant remember lol

3,Is there a way from like changing objects around like a bank stand from edvill and turn it around clockwise,(A different direction) or a different location

4,Is there a way you can add objects ?

I hope omone can help this time as last time no one could be bothered to write i dont know, so please help</description>

<li>It may be your ISP, i had to call them to make my ip different or something and then people were able to play.</li>
<li>Sample: <code>makeGlobalObject(absX, absY, ObjectID, face, 10);</code><br>
To change face, change it to -3 -2 -1 or 0 or something like that.</li>
<li>To a client or you want to spawn objects?</li>
