    <description>I&#39;m using a PI base and my server didn&#39;t come with a donator sign in public chat. Can someone show me how to add it? Btw, the donator sign shows in yell, but not in public chat. Also, I need help with the crowns for PMs. Like, when an admin PMs someone, their crown shows as a mod crown. I forgot what it was for mod.</description>
