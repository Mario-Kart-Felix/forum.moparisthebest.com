<p>ok skype me and ill send you a compiler file or ill help you out, it might be named build, or in your run file it might be press r to run or press c to compile, you could also be click here to play or play. people name it weird things sometimes. and to create a new character file, just rune the server, run your client, when the client finishes loading, click log in, and use any old user and pass (a user not used yet) and login with that, you can see what characters have been made by going to the character folder in your source/ server file.[/quote]<br>
