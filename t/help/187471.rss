    <description>I downloaded Nemesis Online (an RSC Private Server) and MoparScape. Installed Mopar, unzipped Nemesis w/ WinRAR. That is as far as I have got/reached. When I click &quot;Run&quot; I get this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&#39;java&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. Please press any key to continue . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What programs do I need to have installed to run clients?
What changes do I need to make to my PC in order to have clients run and work smoothly? 
How do I fix this error?

These are the Java programs I currently have installed (exact names). If they are of any help:
- Java 2 Runtime Environment, SE v1.4.2_13
- J2SE Runtime Environment 5.0 Update 9

I have been around the MS community before but that was a year ago and I have forgotten everything I learned xD.

Please tell me the names of the programs I need to have installed and the changes I need to make (step by step please). Is there a guide for beginners anywhere? Like people who start at complete zero. I think that RSC servers are different from RS2 because I remember that with RS2 you just typed the IP and that was all.

Help me :)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 08, 2008, 04:30:29 PM[/size][hr].. still need help</description>
