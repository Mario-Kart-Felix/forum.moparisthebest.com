Hey guys, i&#39;ve been trying to play mopar for a while, i used to play back in the day but then i stopped. I never had trouble connecting to servers back then, but now its all about downloading the clients, and im sure this question gets asked ooo so much. I&#39;ve used google, and tried to find any help whatsoever but i just can&#39;t. I&#39;m sure its easy to figure out, i downloaded mopar 3.2 and also have the webclient 4.1...i&#39;m just not sure how to get into a server. i know all about the status checker and what not, but when i download the client for the server im trying to get into where do i put it in order to play? i really do appreciate the help, thanks guys.</description>

<p>First head over to <a href="http://www.Moparscape.org/serverstatus.php" rel="nofollow noopener">www.Moparscape.org/serverstatus.php</a></p>
<p>Take a look at the <span class="bbcode-b">Sponsored Servers</span>, scroll down and you’ll see all of the servers sponsored by <span class="bbcode-b">Moparisthebest</span>.</p>
<p>If you scroll down more you have a bunch of options.</p>
<p>All you have to do is click and see the information, such as if they need you to <span class="bbcode-b">download a client, or use a webclient</span>, etc.</p>
<p>Pm me if you need any additional information.</p>
