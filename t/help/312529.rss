    <title>Help!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help/312529</link>
    <description>So I had a confusing 317, the one where it had 2 folders; Bin, and Server. The Server file had all the .java files with others folders in it, and the Bin had the character files, and the .class files.

This was too confusing for me, so I just moved everything into the same folder. Everything was fine, except when I compiled, I got a few random Fishing.java errors.

[code]Fishing.java:30: &#39;;&#39; expected
                    ]
                     ^
Fishing.java:37: &#39;;&#39; expected
                    ]
                     ^
Fishing.java:44 &#39;;&#39; expected
                    ]
                     ^

3 errors
Press any key to continue...[/code]

I know most of you will probably say something like &quot;Add a ; after the ]&quot; but I did and got 100 errors.

I don&#39;t know what to do, and I need serious answers.

Any help is appreciated.</description>
