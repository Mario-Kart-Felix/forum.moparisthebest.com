              <p>If you don’t know how to do the quest then the food delay is to advance for you but im more of a 317 person but I think login.java is either a player changing thing or its related to a client.java try checking there like in the quest tab if it said “FOOD” and you wanted that to give food you would probley try this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">addItem(656, 1);</code></pre>
<p>Change the 656 to food code and the 1 to as many as you wanna give to the player clicking that…</p>
