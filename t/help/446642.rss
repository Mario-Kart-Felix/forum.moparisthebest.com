              <p>what your saying does not really make that much sense however, if you are saying how to change your clients ip, go to client.java search: server = and change that ip to what you want it to to find your acual ip, there are several sites now, if you want your no-ip duc ip… you open up no-ip after dling and creating a host and you can find it there. and since ur webclient isn’t finding the ip, your ports may not be open…</p>
