    <description>Hey I have player owned shops on my server, im using InsidiaX as a base, and it already has this coded in but when you click &quot;value&quot; on the item that you are GOING to sell, it disconnects, and this i assume is because it cannot find a value for it because it does not have one set due to the fact that it is going to be sold in the player owned shops. The error that i get is the java.land.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 7390. I&#39;m not sure what code I would need to post, so what ever code you need to be able to help ill will post it when you ask. Im looking to either make it do nothing, or say it is worth 0 coins or something. Remember, this is when you click value of the item when it is in your INVENTORY, not when it is in the shop after you set the price.
