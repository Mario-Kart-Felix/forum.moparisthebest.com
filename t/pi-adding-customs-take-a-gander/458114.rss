    <title>[PI] Adding Customs...Take a gander</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-adding-customs-take-a-gander/458114</link>
    <description>I know there are a billion guide out there but none of them helped me, so I&#39;d get some Real help.
I know that I need the Model&#39;s and to put them Client sided/Cache to the Raw folder.
And then add the Int&#39;s to Itemdef.java.
I&#39;ve done this over 10 times with all different customs and NONE worked. It always comes out with errors or if it does go though the item looks nothing like its supposed to no matter what I do, can I get some assistance please?
Please be VERY descriptive.
-If you could get me Angel Wings model&#39;s and int&#39;s that would be GREATLY appreciated.</description>
