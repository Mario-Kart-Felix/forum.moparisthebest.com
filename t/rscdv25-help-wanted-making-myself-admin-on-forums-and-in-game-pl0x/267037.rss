In Game Admin - Goto to phpadmin, click on rscd_player on the left, find your name, click the pencil like thing next to your name, change rank from whatever it is to 1 for admin, 2 for mod, hit save and your done</p>
<p>Fourm Admin - Same step as above but instead of cliking on rscd_player, goto users on the left side.</p>

              <p>Pl0x is the best term ever.</p>
<p>By making the client so other people can play would be in reference to binding the world server to his public IP so that other players can connect. Best way to do that is either set the world.xml where it has the server IP as 0.0.0.0 OR do start&gt; run&gt; type CMD and press enter&gt; type ipconfig and press enter &gt; find where it has your internal IP address (should be something like 192.168.1.xxx and copy what you read on your computer into the world.xml where the server IP is. You may also need to do port forwarding for port 43594. Google how to do that.</p>
