    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-downloading-problem/451004</link>
    <description>Hopefully this is the right section.., Hey everyone im using the vengence-x v2 client for my base project, im not going to put time into my project if it will not be webclient capable and this is my problem..:

I finally got the client to download the cache from my dropbox link and unzip itself no problem and then after it fully unzips it the client loads perfectly and can log onto the server but...

The once the client is closed out of and when a new client is opened the client will not load anymore and says &quot; Error trying again in 5..4..3..2..1 &quot; for some odd reason it won&#39;t load from were the client put the cache when it downloaded it and can&#39;t run again...

now everytime i run the client it downloads cache, not just the first time, and when its done downloading it to the c:/ it says error with the yellow message like if a webclient dosn&#39;t load

Someone please help via explanation or teamviwer, any help is greatly apreciated, Thanks - 4ces</description>
