    <title>Teleport gfx</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/teleport-gfx/229042</link>
    <description>I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to change gfx for when you teleport. When I do an ancient it shows sparkels I was wondering if someone could tell me how to change to normal. Also if anyone could help with vengeance gfx (shows sparkels to,) it would be very helpful.</description>
