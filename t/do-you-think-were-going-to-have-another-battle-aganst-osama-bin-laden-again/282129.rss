USA would just get raped though they’d do some pretty mighty damage to China, Russia and Europe seeing as they’re the strongest countries/continents so USA would aim to take out them before they can launcher their nukes.</p>

<p>The theoretical war you mention here would mean the destruction of America, even if they win the war. Other country’s won’t like America anymore, and then it’s bye bye trade.</p>

<p>XD That’s going in my siggy.</p>
<p>Ontopic: If USA just randomly nuked where they thought Osama was it’d be incredibly moronic and well it would start a huge war where it’s pretty much USA vs Every other country.  USA would just get raped though they’d do some pretty mighty damage to China, Russia and Europe seeing as they’re the strongest countries/continents so USA would aim to take out them before they can launcher their nukes.  That is of course ignoring the fact that Osama is as big a threat to USA as the common housefly, capturing him is just so the US army doesn’t look foolish and just for pride.</p>
<p>There was no initial war against Osama, the invasion in Iraq isn’t and wasn’t a war it was well an invasion.  Calling it a war is like calling Galipoli a successful invasion, it simply isn’t.</p>

Oh, that makes sense. America’s nuclear weapons are probably just as old as Russia’s, but I don’t know for certain.<br>
Hopefully not, but chances are there will be another war… there is just too much conflict for there not to be.</p>

The only reason for that is the radiation/blast radius of the bombs.</p>
