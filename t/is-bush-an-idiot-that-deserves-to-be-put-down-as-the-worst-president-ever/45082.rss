A debate on this would be nice, probably get more than half the country an actual reason to hate him.All these music videos today keep saying hes a bad president but don't even give a reason why?

              <p>Bush is definitely not the BEST president ever. Now before you go crazy on me, I definitely do not think he is president-material. I like to think of him as an average guy. Few people you see on the street are capable of being president, and Bush represents that. He is no great tactician, and he doesn’t think before he acts, but I doubt any of you could be the single most powerful man in the strongest country in the world without a few screw-ups.</p>

The deficit was obviously going to go up, I see no way anyone could’ve avoided that. But I certainly don’t like the excessive spending (since I’m a conservative, if you didn’t know :)).

              <p>You’re set in your ways. And no amoutn of facts or evidence will possibly persuade you to think that bush is an idiot. You think he’s patriotic because of his upbringing. Wow… that did not make sense at all. Do you know what patriotic means?</p>
<p><a href="http://Dictionary.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Dictionary.com</a>’s meaning of a patriot.</p>
<blockquote>a person who loves, supports, and defends his or her country and its interests with devotion.</blockquote>
<p>He did not love, he did not support, and he did not defend. His interests were for himself and the republican party. He has made so much money in the war and a lot of people don’t even see this. You don’t even care that 3000 people died for no reason? How insensitive are you? It might have been a low death ratio, but look at how many iraqis have been killed. Over 100,000. And they were just pissed off cause there people were being killed because the US took down Saddam. The Shiites and Soonis are having a huge war because of us. Is that what we call spreading democracy? How about spreading chaos and anarchy? That fits the goal.</p>
<p>They don’t care that we brought saddam down. They just want us to leave. So before we have anymore americans and iraqis killed, let’s leave. People are calling this Bush’s Vietnam, and he doesn’t want to lose. He finally admitted the whole war was wrong yesterday and people said it’s about fuckin time he realized.</p>
<p>Just to sum up…<br>
And you’re not just oblivious, you’re stubborn. Even though the shit is hitting the fan, you are still saying the world is still right. You’re glad we went to the iraq war. You’re glad 3000 people died because of bush. You’re glad saddam is dead and 100,000 iraqis have been killed. You’re glad the deficit is 8 trillion dollars and the only factor was bush and his iraq war which has been accumulating to over trillions of dollars. You’re glad you have no clue what the unemploymency is in the US because you never even heard of the millions of jobs lost due to outsourcing in this country. You’re glad that bush says global warming doesn’t exist and pays off his researchers to say that it doesn’t… when it does (it’s summer in NH right now when it should be freezing cold).</p>

<p>California was the first state to request it, others joined, but you need lots of states to say that. He shouldn’t just be impeached, he should be tried for treason for an illegal war that was not allowed by congress</p>
<p>Edit: oh and cruel, illegal tapping is illegal. We are supposed to have constitutional rights, but bush treats the constitution like toilet paper. No law is supposed to violate any of the constitional or bill of rights.</p>

He just asked for several billions dollars in funding and 10,000 more americans to wipe out in the shit iraq war.</p>
<p>You must be very oblivious to all of this, if you think this is patriotic? Maybe I should go and shoot someone, that would make me so patriotic. Especially if I made money on it! Oh yaaaa! :rolleyes:</p>

Clinton was a wicked smart guy, he had like a 200 or 190 ish IQ whereas Bush (which is proven) has a double digit IQ or one around 110. Which is pretty much a bird brain.<br>

<p>[quote=“Krazy_Meerkat, post:24, topic:45082”]I think clinton has done a shitload more for your country than bush ever could. I trust clinton but I cannot trust bush. After seeing his reaction when told about the 9/11 attacks I had no respect for george w. bush at all. The worst part was when he stayed in the classroom and continued reading with the class, knowing that his country could potentially be under attack.<br>
I think he is a bad man who will be replaced by more bad people. He should not be in charge of a country.<br>
I’m not here to argue anything really so don’t flame at me, my opinions will most likely remain the same no matter what is said.[/quote]<br>
Smart guy right there. Yeah I totally agree man. Clinton did some amazing things. But anything is better than our idiot president. Hugo Chavez called him Satin lol.</p>
<p>[quote=“cruel, post:21, topic:45082”]-Clinton made a unilateral decision (yes, against the UN) to bomb Iraq because of weapons programs<br>
-Clinton’s administration acknowledged the existence of WMDs in Iraq and felt Iraq to be a threat<br>
-Clinton’s administration solid evidence of a link between Saddam’s regime and Al Qaeda[/quote]<br>
Replace all the “Clinton” with Bush and that will be correct. There were no WMDs. There was no connection to Al Qaeda. Bush said intelligence failed when asked “what about the WMDs?” which was complete bullshit cause a week later, CIA said that notified bush of there being no WMDs but bush insisted on going to war. There was no solid evidence to connect Saddam with Al Quaeda, so that statement is just fuckin false.</p>
<p>If you believe all that bullshit, even now, when all the news has come out, that you haven’t been reading, then you’re definitely oblivious. I’m not insulting you, just saying you need to read this information. The only people ingnorant now, are lol, the people that don’t know. Still about 20% or so.</p>

So bush has the IQ of a child? Well you don’t need to double-check that one -.-</p>
<p>I do not approve of bush. I think his morals and attitude to leading a country is entirely wrong. Let me get started…<br>
He starts a war on “terror”, an omni-namable enemy that can never die<br>
He imposes a “with us or against us” to war, I thought war was a bad thing?<br>
He lets soldiers of many nationalities die for his own beliefs.<br>
He seems to be widening the rich v poor gap by supporting the corporations and not the workers.<br>
His public speaking skills are incredibly lacking, sometimes I begin to wonder if he knows what he is saying.<br>
He is carrying on his father’s work.<br>
He invades a country full of people who hate america and tries to change their way of life and set up his own political system.<br>
He takes rights away from civilians (I’m referring to the anti-terror laws which (if I’m correct) hypothetically violate many of the laws already in place (reguarding searching and captivity))</p>
<p>I think clinton has done a shitload more for your country than bush ever could. I trust clinton but I cannot trust bush.

I think the funniest thing related to that was a skit on comedy inc with John Howard talking about sweet talking all of the next possible US presidents. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Of course there’s another question - Would any of the other possible presidents do any better? Here in Australia we have two dominant political parties. The first is the Liberal Party (led by John Howard), and the second is the Labor Party (Yes, it’s spelt like that. I can’t remember who their leader is now, but it was Kim Beazley). The issue here is that no matter which one we vote for, we’ll still have an annoying group of people governing Australia. So it’s a lose lose situation, and people don’t care enough… So they just vote Johnny everytime, because he hasn’t fucked us up yet.<br>
Is it the same situation in America? Because then you couldn’t really put him down…[/quote]<br>
the better skit was when john said he’s quitting</p>

</aside>
<p>No, those two reasons just made him unfit to be president (assuming the “lie” was referring to the perjury in court). It didn’t make him a bad president. But even if so, those’d be better than your reason of “Bush is dumb”.<br>
But if you were referring the to the lie he told the survivors of Rwanda’s genocide, then yes, that’s one of the many reasons I’d give. He avoided the genocide and, in essence, lets hundreds of thousands of people die. You certainly can’t say the same about Bush. At least he responded to the Kurdish genocide… and not a belated response, like Clinton’s.<br>
In fact, you could even say that Clinton was partially, if not fully, responsible for the WTC attacks since Clinton let Osama Bin Laden slip away even after Sudan offered him up to him. Although that’s a little bit unfair, it’s very true.</p>
<p>-Clinton made a unilateral decision (yes, against the UN) to bomb Iraq because of weapons programs<br>
-Clinton’s administration acknowledged the existence of WMDs in Iraq and felt Iraq to be a threat<br>
-Clinton’s administration solid evidence of a link between Saddam’s regime and Al Qaeda</p>
<p>Would the supporters of the administration support Bush’s doing of the same thing? Of course not (because he has, and they don’t)… the hatred against Bush is practically fully personal and unreasonable.</p>
