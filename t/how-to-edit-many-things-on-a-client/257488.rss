    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-edit-many-things-on-a-client/257488</link>
    <description>NOTE:this is only if the original owner of the client says you can leech

NOTE:i posted this on silab forums and thought id post here too xD

hey guys this is my first tut!!! and client editing i figured out on meh own!!! but i felt like helping you guys  ;) ok well lets get started!


NOTE: MAKE A COPY OF YOUR CLIENT JUST IN CASE!!!


files edited: client.java, frame_sub1, EGUI, (servername).png, Class30_sub2_sub1_sub1.java........
things needed: jdk, client files, CTRL+F, A BRAIN!

ok well if you were me we would edit the background first :)!! 

so in order to do that open your client folder and scroll down to (servername).png 

for example if your server name was deltascape it would be deltascape.png (but it shows deltascape as the name)

now double click it and if anything but mspaint pops up, close it and right click it and press open with... and choose mspaint or further known as paint

ok well now you got this screen with a image on it... you ask what now? well what you do is go to the left with all the paint colors and stuff and click the one in the upper right (the one with the dotted lines forming a rectange)

then right click your picture and press past from...

then choose what picture you want your background to be BUT BE WARNED!!!!! if it is too small the client is gonna look like crud it&#39;ll mostly be black except the pic you put on.....

ok after that save the image and go back to your client folder....

now if you were me again you would change the name and ip of the client...

to change the name go into frame_sub1

and if you just look right at the screen it says the client name in these &quot;&quot; change the name to what you want!

now save the file and exit...

now lets change the ip and change the name of everything... for example..

it says like &quot;jai&#39;s server client is loading... please wait&quot;

well you can change it to yours for example my client is &quot;Whip Lash Client is loading SO WAIT!!&quot;

ok so go into the files client.java

now do CTRL and F at the same time!

now search your client name 

for example &quot;deltascape&quot;

and change the name of your client to what you want so like this: change: deltascape into jkingscape

and when it comes to the ip addresses change it to your servers ip address

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
well now its pretty decent but if you want to REALLY spend some time on your client to make it FANCY

what you can do is open client.java and search for things like &quot;open&quot; &quot;enter your username and password&quot; and what not into different words AND you can change the colors too!

to change the colors go before the word that you want to change colors with and do like @red@ or @gre@ and such...

but if you do that only use the first 3 letters of that color -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ok now where was i?

oh yes 

now save client.java and close it 

we are almost done  :( 

ok now open up Class30_sub2_sub1_sub1.java

now search for your old client name like deltascape

now it will say 
[code]Image image = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().createImage(&quot;./deltascape.png&quot;);[/code]

or something like that..

now replace &quot;deltascape&quot; (or whatever the old client name is or whatever) and change it to the name you want your client to be....

now go back to that .png image when you scroll down and rename it with what you want your server to be...

like for example:

from: &quot;deltascape&quot; to: &quot;jai-scape&quot;

the final part... 

is to compile...

for a amazing compiler (the one i use for my server&#39;s and clients)

go to the next post and do what it says there for the compiler!

NOTE: this code was originally made by ric914 i edited a bit

and then exit and save then click on compiler

and press &quot;c&quot; and then press enter

wait for it to compile

then bam your client is done

NOTE: if you get any errors or such or need help just tell me and i will help fix!

THANKS FOR READING MY FIRST TUT!

good replies please... its meh first tut :)

THANKS AGAIN!


EDIT:
i forgot 1 thing....  you can right click &quot;run&quot; and change the name and title of that

you can also change the colors by changing the numbers

thats it 

THANKS AGAIN![br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 19, 2009, 08:36:13 pm[/size][hr]and what you do for the code is right click compiler delete all of it and put this:

Note: exceeds limit so ill give ya a horrible one.. you can find the awsome one on the silab forums of this same thing

[code]@echo off
Title Compiler
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_05\bin\javac.exe&quot; *.java
pause [/code]

and just replace the jdk with what you have
