Very interesting theory and I believe this may actually be the answer to quantum gravity. I like it because it does away with dark matter and dark energy, which I believe is nonsensical. We created dark matter and dark energy to explain phenomenon that the current model of physics cannot explain, which I believe is the incorrect way about the problem. This is not the first time science has done this either. Look up the ether and phlogiston. I love how you also cannot directly detect dark matter but it is there. That makes a lot of sense. Very interesting regardless and I cannot wait to read more about the developments of this theory. Also an interesting read that was linked in the article.

Whoever creates a process to manufacture graphene industrially will have a gold mine.</description>
