              <p>If you want to add a character file to the source, you need to find the Characters directory, it might be saves, or anything depending on the layout of the source. But most 317s have it as Characters. Also, for the ‘weird error’ please post it.</p>
<p>It’s most likely to do with your JDK setup as more errors among this type are. For the client cache - make a topic in client help as this is for server help only.</p>
