    <description>(Source used: Ultimate PK   - its based off cheezescape pk)

My server keeps crashing because of mass clickers in ranged.

I have observed the source of other combat forms, and found that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;PkingDelay = 15;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stops mass clicking by putting a delay between attacks.



Where is the code for ranged? And where would I place that code?</description>
