    <title>I am looking for a rs privet server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-am-looking-for-a-rs-privet-server/548353</link>
    <description>Hello, lets just start with saying.. I AM A COMPLETE N00B.  :palm:

I have been writing in Java for a while in some high school comp sic courses. I have been playing RS for years and I recently was brought upon this website and I am very excited! I am looking for Source code for a rs privet server that is almost the same as the original rs 07. I am am planing to play with it on my own, not for a profit benefit. I just want to learn a bit about it. 

I was wondering if someone could link me to this source code?

oh! p.s I was hoping I could do this using something like Java Eclipse

Just to clarify i&#39;m just looking for the client source code</description>
