    <title>Mysterious cancelled lunar mission</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mysterious-cancelled-lunar-mission/454053</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve always been the type of person that is amazed by anything that involves the cosmos --even documentaries. I saw a movie today called Apollo 18 and I thought to myself; hey, there wasn&#39;t an Apollo 18 mission. Since my curiosity overcomes me on matters like this, I decided to get the movie. I was amazed by the footage, and it really is hard to depict whether this was actual footage or not, because the Apollo 18 mission was supposedly cancelled. There is a website you can go to view the entire 84 hours of the of the footage recovered from the &quot;cancelled&quot; mission; however, this movie I just watched states that it shows the footage that was cut from the official Apollo 18 footage, and it has some creepy stuff in it. I&#39;m not sure if a lot of people know about this or not, as it seems the government tried to keep this away from public knowledge, so for those of you that have heard of the Apollo 18 mission, or have seen the 2011 film, please give me your input about this.

Here is information about the cancelled Apollo missions: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canceled_Apollo_missions

If it is allowed, I will provide a link to the leaked 84 hours of the Apollo 18 mission.

Also, if this is worth explaining, the last time any manned spacecraft went to the moon, was on December 7, 1972. No man has been there ever since, and with the huge leap of technology since the first decade of the lunar missions, it would have seemed we would have launched another mission to the moon. So, the true question is: Why have we not returned to the moon again?</description>

I completely read over the oil part. I don’t remember anyone saying any waters that had oil were cleaned, because that is just impossible. It will take many decades to clean out the water, but even at that it will still not be completely clean.</p>
<p>Also, I’m pretty sure if even Panama was affected, it wasn’t that big of a problem.</p>

They manipulate things to a point of where it just appears to be plain out ridiculous, but as long as they can supply by a factually correct statement, they see themselves in good standing.</p>

I honestly don’t see anything to laugh about. It’s obvious that the government provides a half-wit explanation to things, but that doesn’t mean it’s a total lie.</p>

<p>You do know the cold war ended in the 90’s and the USSR Dissolved correct?</p>
<p>Anyway, just watch this video. Great video put together in the words of Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p>
<p>But if you do want to know about the mystery of the space exploration, I’d say the USSR is filled with way  more mysteries than the US.</p>

<p>I never said I believed anything. I was just wanting to see what others thought of this. Also, the government is just as controversial as space, because there are so many rumors; whether they are true or not, it is hard to believe since the government does indeed keep secrets from the public. I know the government does things for our safety; however, I just find anything hard to believe anymore.</p>
<p>I’ve done a bit of researching and I’ve noticed that Apollo missions 18-20 were cancelled due mainly to budget concerns, but there were also other factors:</p>
<p>[ul][li]The US believe they had conquered everyone in space travel and no longer needed to deploy more missions[/li]<br>
[li]Missions were simply too dangerous to do the same thing they had done several times before.[/li][/ul]<br>
The budget issue is highly debatable simply because we have launched so many unmanned missions after the Apollo missions. The US has even launched several missions into space just to orbit the Earth.</p>
<p>I’m not saying I believe the Apollo 18 movie is real, because in most terms it is most definitely not true at all. That still doesn’t change the fact that the US hasn’t had anymore missions to the Moon, because there are so many reasons to why we would want to return:</p>
<p>[ul][li]More knowledge about our moon, along with more lunar samples - During moonwalks, there wasn’t a large amount of area explored, since most only lasted a few hours at the most.[/li]<br>
[li]The challenge; Kennedy even announced it himself. The main reason these missions were launched was to learn more and get a close up examination of the moon, and also prove to the world that if there was a will to do something, there was a way to accomplish the end goal.[/li][/ul]<br>
I know there are people that will either push this away either because they don’t care or they just don’t want to know, but it is really hard to just forget about something, because as many scientists have stated, you should question everything --no matter the simplicity.</p>

              <p>I’ve always been the type of person that is amazed by anything that involves the cosmos --even documentaries. I saw a movie today called Apollo 18 and I thought to myself; hey, there wasn’t an Apollo 18 mission. Since my curiosity overcomes me on matters like this, I decided to get the movie. I was amazed by the footage, and it really is hard to depict whether this was actual footage or not, because the Apollo 18 mission was supposedly cancelled. There is a website you can go to view the entire 84 hours of the of the footage recovered from the “cancelled” mission; however, this movie I just watched states that it shows the footage that was cut from the official Apollo 18 footage, and it has some creepy stuff in it. I’m not sure if a lot of people know about this or not, as it seems the government tried to keep this away from public knowledge, so for those of you that have heard of the Apollo 18 mission, or have seen the 2011 film, please give me your input about this.</p>
<p>Here is information about the cancelled Apollo missions: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canceled_Apollo_missions" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canceled_Apollo_missions</a></p>
<p>If it is allowed, I will provide a link to the leaked 84 hours of the Apollo 18 mission.</p>
<p>Also, if this is worth explaining, the last time any manned spacecraft went to the moon, was on December 7, 1972. No man has been there ever since, and with the huge leap of technology since the first decade of the lunar missions, it would have seemed we would have launched another mission to the moon. So, the true question is: Why have we not returned to the moon again?</p>
