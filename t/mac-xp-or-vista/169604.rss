    <title>Mac, xp, or vista?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mac-xp-or-vista/169604</link>
    <description>everywhere i look in vista forums or mac forums everybody is always like
&quot;vista is better than mac&quot; &quot;mac is better than vista&quot; and this really gets
annoying! In fact, i think there are way more programs for all windows and
stuffs. Now there are also people who say xp is better than vista. Well,
I am using vista and i have to admit, xp was waaaayyyy more stable.
Even with vistas new aero (which i can&#39;t use), it doesn&#39;t make vista any better
if u want aero on ur xp. go ahead! download topdesk, and vista theme for ur
operating system and your done! IF YOU ALREADY HAVE XP DON&quot;T BOTHER
TO GO TO VISTA. Now maybe if you have mac, you might consider going 
to vista. Of course, I am not saying in general vista is the worst so don&#39;t download
it, actually when SP1 is released, you should upgrade to vista.
thanks for readin
