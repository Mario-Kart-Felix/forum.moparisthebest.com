    <description>[size=13pt]Better Get A Bucket[/size]

Between the two of them, my children vomited nine times Sunday night.

At first, the site of my daughter spewing brings out my fatherly instinct in me. I want to hold her hair and rub her back and tell her she’s going to be just fine.

That lasts for about three seconds. Then comes the realization that I just watched another human being puke, and for me there is very little differentiation between that and, say, watching another human being slice open his own midsection with a dull butter knife and eat his own entrails.

I do not have a strong stomach.

When The Artist Formerly Known As Barney’s Biggest Fan first showed signs of not feeling well, all she said was that her tummy hurt (which was not hard to understand because we had just returned home from a Halloween party at Gary The Amish Chaser’s house, where my children each ate their own bodyweight in candy corns). We set her down on a chair in the living room (a tan-colored chair, which as an important detail to tuck away for later in the story) and put a heating pad on her belly (which seems to me to be the medicinal equivalent of soaking her head in water, but whatever) and let her watch The Care Bears Movie for a few minutes.

A while later, she began to whimper and call out for me and you could just SEE that she was about to boot. So what did I do? I grabbed the heating pad, which was plugged into a nearby electrical outlet, believing perhaps that her pending spewage would be so liquid as to electrocute her. But before I could move the heating pad away, a gush of orange vomit came out of her.

For an instant, time stopped. It was as if the puke just hung there in the air, like a scene from The Matrix, and my brain executed the following calculations during that time warp:

a) The puke is orange.
b) The chair is tan.
c) Orange stains tan.
d) If a+b+c=d, let d=stop the puke before it lands on the chair.

So I caught my daughter’s vomit in the heating pad.

Did I mention that I do not have a strong stomach?

My vomit, which I will categorize not as “sympathy vomit” but as “the kind of vomit any rational person would have if he defied death by electrocution by cradling his daughter’s puke in a plugged-in, light blue heating pad” was not orange. I don’t particularly care for candy corns.

made me laugh
