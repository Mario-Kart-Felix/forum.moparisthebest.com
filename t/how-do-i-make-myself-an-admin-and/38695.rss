              <p>Go on your server with any name and pass. And log out. Go to characters in your file from phonescape and search for your name and open it. You will see rights change it into 3 and your owner, change it into 2 for admin, change it into 1 for mod, 0 is normal player.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 13, 2008, 09:40:27 AM[/size][hr]If you want to make yourself member go to characters and change ismember to 1 and your member on some servers you need to make yourself member with opening a map lnamed members typ your name in it and your member like figmentscape.

              <p>go to character files and click on your screen name if not there go on a client and click run.bat on your source and for ip type 127.0.0.1 and ull be on your source and your character file is created plus go to to the character files and click on your name and find player rights=0 and change the 0 to a 3 so it means owner. you must be log out to do this and i dunno how to make it available its not free<br>
you need a linksys router and need to port forward to do it its risky cuz it can screw up ur router.</p>
