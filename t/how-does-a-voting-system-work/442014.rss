    <title>How does a voting system work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-does-a-voting-system-work/442014</link>
    <description>Hey all,

I see a lot of &#39;vote for rewards&#39; systems out in RSPS&#39;s. How does this work tho? How do you know what someone has done on another website? How do you verify that the user actually voted?

Thanks,

ET

<p>The only popular one that actually checks is RL. What it does is that when you vote, you enter your username in some kind of web form, which will redirect you to the voting site with a $_GET[] / $_POST[] variable (in this case, your username). After RL confirms the vote (meaning successful) they will access your site (which you need to specify in their options) with a parameter of the username. You need to set up a PHP page to handle the RL requests to send them into your MySQL database. Then when the user types a command to attempt to claim the reward, your server should look up the values on your database. If he/she is there, the server will remove them from the list, and give them the reward.</p>

              <p>For MoparScape: No.</p>
<p>For Roone Lokus: Yes, because as of 2012, they can send the voted player’s username into your SQL database through your website and therefore that is how you can check if they voted or not.</p>
<p>Before the RL callback update it was easy to scam vote rewards on private servers. You couldn’t verify if the user voted or not.</p>
