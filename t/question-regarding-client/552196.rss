    <title>Question regarding client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-regarding-client/552196</link>
    <description>Im new to Making RuneScape private servers,i downloaded some sources n clients just to mess around and learn,today i downloaded AbleScape ( server and client and cache ) , i have a few questions

1) i changed IP in client.java,but i dont know how to run the client,since it didnt come with a run.bat,i tried to make a run.bat code but i failed,im terrible with this,can anyone help me??

2)i downloaded AbleScape 530 cache,but i was a little bit confused because usually caches have sprites and stuff,but this one only has some .dat and .idx files,anyways,i dont know where to place the cache ( i know its in C:/ but is there a sign link or something that i can see )

Sorry for my nooby questions , help would be appreciated

edit : usually im used to tutorials but 530&#39;s didnt have lots for begginers





off-topic ( i didnt want to make another post )

When loading the Project decimate client i get this error ( do u think its from cache? ,even though i used cache that came with the client and source )

<p>Are you using a PI? What revision is this exactly?? Source?<br>
Cache should be placed in (C:/ or Users.home)<br>
Where did you download the Cache from? Was it auto-DL or DL’d from the (Post)<br>
Maybe the person who released was using Eclipse to run it?? If you are fimiliar with Eclipse you should honestly use it! It’s one of the greatest programs for java coding. Eclipse: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-standard-432/keplersr2" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-standard-432/keplersr2</a><br>
Do you have a compiler?<br>
Do you have a run for your Source?</p>
<p>EDIT: If you’re talking about this Server here: <a href="http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/google/downloads/534889-ablescape-old-source-pi.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/google/downloads/534889-ablescape-old-source-pi.html</a><br>
Then, yes there should be a file in your client called “Signlink.java” Where you can see where your Cache needs to go. Also as for the Client run, you can get it online i’m sure there are multiple posts about Client run.</p>
<p>EDIT: Here’s a run.bat for ya, lemme know if you run into any probs.</p>
<p><code>
@echo off
title Client
cd class
java -Xmx256m client
pause
</code></p>
<p>And if that doesn’t work for ya, I believe this here is the Client: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n4mdewt2d9t2pbj/%5B317%5D%20AbleScape%20Client%20(RuneLimited).rar" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.dropbox.com/s/n4mdewt2d9t2pbj/[317]%20AbleScape%20Client%20(RuneLimited).rar</a><br>

<p>1-Not a PI<br>
2-Not the 317 one,but the 530 one <a href="http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs-503-client-server/downloads/595637-able-scape-530-release.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs-503-client-server/downloads/595637-able-scape-530-release.html</a><br>
3- i did try the run code,the client gets stuck at “Connecting to update server” and i get a “error_game_js5connect” message in the CMD<br>
some say its because of the cache,i downloaded the ablescape cache and placed in data/cache</p>
<p>??[/quote]<br>
Okay, well the Cache needs to be placed in data/cache that’s right… But let me ask you this: What exactly did you place in the “cache” Folder?? Did you place a folder, the zip file?</p>
