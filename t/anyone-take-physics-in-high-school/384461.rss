              <p>It’s definitely harder than a literature class/etc. but if you like something that’s actually engaging, take it.  I’ve found that most classes bore me to tears, but the more challenging/engaging ones can actually be fun for a change.  Plus, it’s pretty neat to know how the world around you works.</p>

              <p>I took physics for my senior years and loved it. It pushed me to apply for engineering at college. I actually topped the class which allowed me to get a scholarship. I deferred and don’t start until next year though. But you won’t enjoy physics if you don’t like mathematics or problem solving. Plus once you get into quantum physics you have to have an open mind and be able to disregard all the laws of nature that you have been trained to believe for 16 or so years.</p>
