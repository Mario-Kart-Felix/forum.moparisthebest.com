    <title>How to change Co-Owner to Owner</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-change-co-owner-to-owner/346620</link>
    <description>Ok, if you have a server problem like me, and you set your player rights to 3 and it says you&#39;re Co-Owner, then here&#39;s the solution!!

Ok, go to your Source and go to the client.java and search &quot;playerrights&quot; and keep searching for a place where it says: 

if (playerRights == 3) {
                    titles = &quot;[Co-Owner] &quot;;
                }

then change it to:

if (playerRights == 3) {
                    titles = &quot;[Owner] &quot;;
                }

and there you have it!! you are now the owner of your server!!</description>
