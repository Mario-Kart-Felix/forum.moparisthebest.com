Javac Compiler

1.) Okay the first step of making a javac compiler is to download the latest version of Java SE Development Kit (JDK). Which is version 6u2 up to date. You can get it by clicking on the below link then click on the blue box that says download. After that select if you want to download it offline or online. 
[url=http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp]http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp[/url]

2.) Once you download java (JDK 6u2) install it, the process depends on your internet connection. Once java is installed on your computer click on start on the bottom left hand of your computer --&gt; right click on my computer --&gt; click on properties --&gt; click on advanced and then on Environment Variables --&gt; Okay leave that alone for now go to start once again --&gt; click on my documents --&gt; then click on folders

3.) Okay now a box should open up to the left you should see it says Desktop first then My Documents etc.. Go down til you see my computer --&gt; next click on the + next to it --&gt; you should see it collapse next this matters on what your main drive is set my is Local Disk C: thats where all my files are but different versions have different drives. --&gt; okay next click on the + next to your local disk drive --&gt; another new collapse should happen --&gt; After that you should see program files click on the + next to it --&gt; okay now scroll down until you see the Java folder click on it.

4.) Okay open up the folder shown in the picture.(NOTE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THAT FOLDER THEN YOU DID NOT DOWNLOAD JAVA CORRECTLY MAKE SURE YOU HAVE IT BEFORE YOU GO ANY FURTHER)
Okay next click on bin. Alright now copy this.

5.) Then you can close that folder, alright next, go back on Environment Variables now where it says User variables for (your computer name) you should see TEMP, TEMP underneath with some addresses next to them. Right below that click new. For the Variable name put CLASSPATH then for the variable variable value paste that address you had copyed and add ;%CLASSPATH% right after bin. 
mines looks like this Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_07\bin;%CLASSPATH%  After that hit ok. Okay now where it says System variables, you should see Path below it. If you don&#39;t scroll down a little until you do. Click on it and hit edit. For the variable value type in there what i have erase what it already had.
%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\system32\WBEM;C:\Program Files\Intel\DMIX;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_02\bin

6.) Hit ok, then ok again and once more to close out of system properties. Now right click on your desktop and go on new text document. Name it Javac.bat Open it up and write this inside. 

[code]@echo off
title Project Scape Compiler
javac *.java
pause[/code]


Go on file save as and name it Javac.bat. And that&#39;s it! you have made a javac compiler!!! Just place it where your .java documents are and it complies no problem! Finally done. I hope this has helped someone. :D</description>

              <p>What you’ve made isn’t a compiler. JAVAC.exe in the JDK file is a compiler. You’ve only linked to the compiler. Call it maybe how to make a serverbatch. Nice though. Try explaining what each line of code does.</p>
