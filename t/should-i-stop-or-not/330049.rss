              <p>Also what you could do is make it to where your server has a storyline. Mine does. Ill give you the basic outline of the storyline, Three gods existed in a sea of emptiness: Guthix, Saradomin, and Zamorak. Guthix was a god of equality, not good nor evil, not looking at either as a bad “trait.” Saradomin was a god of hope and justice, believing good was the only correct choice. And Zamorak believed on hate and darkness, wanting to rule the lands with despair. The three gods went to war attempting to decide who the strongest was. Without an army to war against, the war ended in a tie between the three gods. Because of this, they created a planet and named it Aughtwar, placing living, breathing creatures with minds that could fight on the side they felt was best. Although the gods had expected these creatures called “humans” to adapt and evolve quickly, these “humans” took hundreds of years. Now, the time has come for the war to break out again, but whose side will you take?  with this story line I have made custom quests and events. You can think of your own story line, or use this one (just give me credit please).</p>

If you have a good server, and have a bunch of players, you will notice that maintaining the server is a 24/7 job.</p>
