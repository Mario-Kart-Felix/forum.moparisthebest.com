        <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I’m designing the backend for my app and had a couple of ideas that I wanted to talk you guys about.</p>
<p>Everything is going to be related to Java:</p>
<p>So the bare basics of programming would tell you that a class is a blueprint e.g. a Person class would describe a person. Nothing more, right?</p>
<p>Let’s think of a game more specifically RSPS (since we all love those) - The typical Player.java may contain some unrelated Player code such as a reference to a Socket or methods to send the user information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this not violate the concept of what a player should be?</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuff like Apollo and Scapeemulator do this. In fact, what is this Player.java class really suppose to be doing? <a href="https://github.com/apollo-rsps/apollo/blob/master/game/src/main/org/apollo/game/model/entity/Player.java" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/apollo-rsps/apollo/blob/master/game/src/main/org/apollo/game/model/entity/Player.java</a></p>
<p>Seems like a lot going on for a class that is supposed to just model a Player.</p>
<p>Now what I think the correct approach would be is to have the player class actually define a player and nothing else e.g.</p>
<p>class Player { String name; String health; String runEnergy; }</p>
<p>Then have some other entity dealing with player updating, network calls etc. In regards to “how would we then send a player messages?” Maybe a map or a repo? Be creative <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Going a little deeper into the core of a rsps, let’s talk about how some people implement networking (example).<br>
When I was using Scapeemulator, I wanted to swap the networking library (that does the job a little better for what I wanted). I couldn’t, netty was everywhere making it impossible to do what I wanted.</p>
<p>What do you guys think about writing lightweight wrappers or strictly private modules? Maybe?</p>
<p>Hopefully, you guys could give a novice like me some advice on how I should be coding <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>If you’re going to use a JVM language, why not give Kotlin a try? It has some pretty nice things (e.g.: coroutines, a means to cooperative scheduling) going for it.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the design doesn’t matter that much - as long as it’s maintainable in the eyes of whoever needs to maintain it. In a managed runtime like the JVM though, you’ll want to be mindful of things like garbage collection and the latency/jitter it introduces.</p>
