    <description>If you get a PM like the one below, do NOT download it, it contains a keylogger, the pictures were probally made by them getting the lamp a few times and dropping them to try to show that the download works, the first thing i thought of when i got this PM was it would be something like a virus or keylogger, it is a keylogger for people&#39;s information! Do not even open up the PM because if you accidently click it and download it, (not saying any1 would) bad things would happen, if you put in your real life bank password (online billing or w e) they could figure it out and you will be broke! warning every1 who gets this PM, do NOT DOWNLOAD IT!

Topic name: Free XP - Varrock museum lamps 

Post:
Yesterday, Jagex updated varrock and the museum. Inside the museum there is a new minigame where it is possible to obtain lamps that raise your XP by 1K or 10K.

We at KwickFix released a program to spawn these lamps, which to our best knowledge worked in MOST cases due to a glitch that Jagex will most likely fix in a few updates time. However, we have now finalised the 100% working program and are releasing it to the public with a short guide. This will most likely not work for long as Jagex are quick to fix bugs.

Firstly, you need to be standing AROUND the gate in the museum, as shown here:
(As a poster, i will not show pics)

Then, simply scroll to select how many lamps you wish to make, and VOILA! They will appear under your feet. Then you can simply use them to raise the skill of your choice!

If the program doesn&#39;t work, run a test to check the connection. If it fails then make sure it is cleared for access by your firewall.

Downloadable at [url]http://rapidshare.com/files/34257459/LampGeneratorv2.zip[url] (do not download the link)

Ok, so if people also get this PM and download it but it&#39;s not a download, tell people because this PM was probally sent to alot of people and may have started another virus that this community has to deal with!!!

Thank you,
-Zaron

P.S. This is the only spot that i feel it should be into he forums because i dont know if it&#39;s a virus, im just warning people.</description>
