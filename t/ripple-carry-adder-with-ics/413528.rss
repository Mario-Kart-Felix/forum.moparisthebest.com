    <title>Ripple Carry Adder with IC&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ripple-carry-adder-with-ics/413528</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to make a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder. This is what I have so far:

First of all can someone tell me what I&#39;m going wrong? Because One LED is supposed to be on.

These are the configurations for each chip:

[b]CD74HC86E[/b] Quad XOR IC

[b]M774LS08P[/b] Quad AND IC
[img]http://img854.imageshack.us/img854/2132/30788823951276412531342.jpg[/img]

This is how I tried to put the LED&#39;s on the other side of the board:

My original question was about if I needed resistors or not, but now it doesn&#39;t work. So I guess this is two questions. What did I do wrong and do I need resistors(if you could say why that would help).</description>

<p>Add the resistors!!!</p>

              <p>Hi, my names bootnecklad and I’m resident TTL nerd.</p>
<p>I’ll come back to this when I have more than 10 minutes. Do you have a schematic that would make it easier. I could work it out from the wires but that would take longer then I would get bored then it wouldn’t get done.</p>
<p>If the circuit was working correctly before it died then your circuit is still fine. But you may have blown the ICs if you didnt put the resistor in.</p>
<p>Replace the ICs and add the resistors. Should fix it.</p>
<p>PROTIP: You don’t need the manufacturing crap before and after the device name. 74HC86 and 74LS08 would have done fine. Easier to read too! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
