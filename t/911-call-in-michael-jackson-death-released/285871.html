        <p>Yup, here it is:</p>
<blockquote>LOS ANGELES – A 911 caller seeking help for Michael Jackson told an emergency operator that only a personal physician had seen what happened, and an ambulance was urgently needed because resuscitation efforts weren't working.
<p>The Los Angeles Fire Department on Friday released a redacted audio recording of the call made Thursday by a person who only referred to Jackson as a 50-year-old man. It appeared that a mention of the phone number was deleted from the recording.</p>
<p>“I need an ambulance as soon as possible, sir,” the caller said urgently but politely. “We have a gentlemen here that needs help and he’s not breathing yet. He’s not breathing and we need to — we’re trying to pump him, but he’s not, he’s not.”</p>
<p>The caller reported that Jackson was on a bed and the emergency operator began to instruct him to do CPR, but stopped when the caller said that the personal physician was there.</p>
<p>“Oh, OK. We’re on our way there. If your guy is doing CPR and you’re instructed by a doctor, he’s a higher authority than me. And he’s on the scene,” the 911 operator said.<br>
The operator asked if anyone witnessed what happened.</p>
<p>“No, just the doctor, sir, the doctor was the only one there,” the caller said.</p>
<p>“Did he see what happened?” the operator asked.</p>
<p>“Doctor, did you see what happened, sir?” the caller asked someone in the room. Only an urgent mumbling can be heard on the recording.</p>
<p>“We’re on our way. It’s less than a mile away from Cedars,” the operator said, referring to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</p>
<p>Paramedics, however, took Jackson to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was later pronounced dead.</p>
