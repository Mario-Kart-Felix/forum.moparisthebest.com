    <title>911 Call in Michael Jackson death released</title>

    <description>Yup, here it is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;LOS ANGELES – A 911 caller seeking help for Michael Jackson told an emergency operator that only a personal physician had seen what happened, and an ambulance was urgently needed because resuscitation efforts weren&#39;t working.

The Los Angeles Fire Department on Friday released a redacted audio recording of the call made Thursday by a person who only referred to Jackson as a 50-year-old man. It appeared that a mention of the phone number was deleted from the recording.

&quot;I need an ambulance as soon as possible, sir,&quot; the caller said urgently but politely. &quot;We have a gentlemen here that needs help and he&#39;s not breathing yet. He&#39;s not breathing and we need to — we&#39;re trying to pump him, but he&#39;s not, he&#39;s not.&quot;

The caller reported that Jackson was on a bed and the emergency operator began to instruct him to do CPR, but stopped when the caller said that the personal physician was there.

&quot;Oh, OK. We&#39;re on our way there. If your guy is doing CPR and you&#39;re instructed by a doctor, he&#39;s a higher authority than me. And he&#39;s on the scene,&quot; the 911 operator said.
The operator asked if anyone witnessed what happened.

&quot;No, just the doctor, sir, the doctor was the only one there,&quot; the caller said.

&quot;Did he see what happened?&quot; the operator asked.

&quot;Doctor, did you see what happened, sir?&quot; the caller asked someone in the room. Only an urgent mumbling can be heard on the recording.

&quot;We&#39;re on our way. It&#39;s less than a mile away from Cedars,&quot; the operator said, referring to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

Paramedics, however, took Jackson to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was later pronounced dead.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
