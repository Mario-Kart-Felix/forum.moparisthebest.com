Ok, I have been reading some posts lately and have noticed that many people are having problems running clients saying that it shutsdown after clicking a couple of times.....

People have also said to change settings to there computer.....Or say windows 7 sucks.....

THERE IS A SIMPLE WAY TO FIX THIS. [IT ONLY TAKES LESS THAN A SECOND TO FIX] Isn&#39;t that good?

Well the problem is that windows 7 is x86 and most visa or xp computers are different. So we need a code in our Run.bat that runs off of x86.

So when you see like the code after @echo off change the thing under it to.....

[code=code]&quot;C:/program files (x86)/java/jre6/bin/java.exe&quot; -Xmx1024m client 0 0 highmem members 0[/code]



Hope this helped alot for all you windows 7 users! It helped me too when I got windows 7!

NOTE: I WAS NOT THE CREATOR OF THIS CODE SO I GIVE ALL CREDIT TO WHOEVER CREATED IT. THANKS!
