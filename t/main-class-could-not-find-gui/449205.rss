    <title>Main class could not find GUi</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/main-class-could-not-find-gui/449205</link>
    <description>Hi I just made a downloadable client and uploaded it to mediafire but my friend can&#39;t play on it. He says it says Main class could not find GUI. I deleted the .java files and made the others hidden except for the run. I also changed all of the ips to my no-ip and archived to rar. Please help</description>
