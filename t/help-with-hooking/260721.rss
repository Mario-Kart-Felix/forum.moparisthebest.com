    <title>Help With Hooking</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-hooking/260721</link>
    <description>Could someone give me some with my try at creating a simple BCEL bot?

I understand BCEL more or less, but I&#39;m just wondering how people go about &quot;hooking.&quot; 

I figured out Runescape Version, RSString, and Canvas hooks easy enough, but how do you guys go about the other ones? Like.. what is your &quot;mindset&quot; behind creating the hook. Do you use a Debob... because the one we have on here renames all the fields? 

It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t &quot;want to release your secrets&quot; or whatever -- I was just interested. 

Thanks in advance,
Duncan</description>

I strongly recommend you do not learn about the client by looking at other peoples updater outputs. Firstly, it would be all too easy to skip right over the learning part, and also, there are a few people kicking around who don’t know as much as they appear to.</p>
<p>Any way that you feel comfortable finding fields and such is fine, if you want to look through a deob to gain understanding and then try and translate that to a bytecode pattern (or however you’re actually matching) there’s nothing wrong with that.<br>

<p>Could you just point me in the right direction? So far, I’ve just done ones that happen to stick out… you know.</p>
