    <description>317 delta

can someone fix this code for me and explain to me what you changed in it, like what was wrong with it.
basically im making a lava party hat, but its bronze, i want that changed to the lava colored code, and make it so it is wielded on your head and not as your weapon, because my client has some custom phats and g body but they are all wielded as weapons so i need to know how to fix.

you get it, so here is code.
[code]if(i == 6898){ //Kyles phat
class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
class8.anIntArray156 = new int[1];
class8.anIntArray160 = new int [1];
class8.anIntArray156[0] = 926;
class8.anIntArray160[0] = 5652;
class8.anInt174 = 2635;
class8.anInt181 = 440;
class8.anInt190 = 76;
class8.anInt198 = 1850;
class8.anInt204 = 0;
class8.anInt169 = 1;
class8.anInt194 = 1;
class8.anInt165 = 187;
class8.anInt200 = 363;
class8.anInt175 = 29;
class8.anInt197 = 87;
class8.aString170 = &quot;Kyle&#39;s Party Hat&quot;;
class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;A Party Hat for the unreal Owner, Kyle.&quot;.getBytes();[/code]
