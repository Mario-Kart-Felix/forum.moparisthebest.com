    <description>What it is , when i put my server online it says connecting to 0.0.0.0:43594 
I dont know if its meant to do that but it does..

And when i run my client and connect to the right ip address it says something like &quot; Failed to get responce from server please try another world &quot;.

Does anyone know how to fix this please? if so please could you help me by telling me below?
