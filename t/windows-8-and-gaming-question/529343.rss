    <title>Windows 8 and Gaming question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/windows-8-and-gaming-question/529343</link>
    <description>So I got a new computer(finally..) today. I have downloaded some games online such as Tera, Star Wars, Need for Speed, World of Warcraft, and Marvel Heroes. 

All of these games are saying that my &quot;connection has been lost&quot; or something of a similar issue. It isn&#39;t the internet connection cause I am right by the router/able to go to other sites easily. 

From what I gather this is a major current issue in the Windows 8 forums? So is there a &quot;cheap fix&quot; for this or something? I&#39;d very much like to test the power of my new pc.</description>

              <p>[quote=“SilentCJ, post:2, topic:529343”]When you say you ‘downloaded’ some games, are they genuine copies?  I know that in the past I’ve used a cracked need for speed and it had exactly the same message.</p>

<p>I will download hypercam and try to make a video for it tonight ( want to test the video processing anyway <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> )</p>
<p>In the mean time if anybody has any other solutions please do post as I can’t really do much in the mean time.</p>
