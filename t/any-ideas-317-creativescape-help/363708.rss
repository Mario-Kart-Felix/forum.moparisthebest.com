    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any-ideas-317-creativescape-help/363708</link>
    <description>ok so my server is completely leeched at this very moment im using creativescape as a source im currently experiancing problems in having a friend connect i wish to do so as if i cant even get past this error there is no point editing out all the bugs ironing everything out in it i am expecting many flames and rants but im not going to defend myself with words my actions shall be my defense if i can get people to be able to connect.

so i have changed my signlink added my ip in and it gets stuck saying:

if i use my localhost everything is fine. [b][u][size=18pt]i can host other servers but not this one[/b] does anyone have any ideas?</description>

Edit: You have changed the Ip, I read through the Thread quickly. Well, I do know that Creativescape is a old base at least I think it is. Therefore some things are going to be difficult to get working.</p>
<p>Uhm… Do you have the Client, I don’t know to be honest. Do you have a client that is functional?[/quote]</p>
<p>yea the source is quite old and hmm it shouldnt be any difficult from other “old” source’s yea the client is functional it works on localhost just when i switch it over to my ip it has problems for people to connect the wierd thing is server status’ checkers say its online it connects to the cache and past the update client part it just recieves no connections i’ve portforwarded etc as i said in the thread i can host other sources and get people to connect just not this one.</p>
<p>specifically looking for anyone that has the creativescape source up and running to see if they ran into any issues like this?</p>

              <p>UGH how can you ignore the BIG BOLD WRITING! yes i have portforwarded and lol thank you for pointing out that im leeching a server i said that straight up!</p>
<p>thank you so much for the most helpful feedback in the world!</p>
<p>but… i shall say thanks (non sarcastic this time lol) for the suggestion on the other 317 but if it can be helped i shall be using the creativescape source <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>anyway anyone got any ideas?</p>
<p>on a weirder note i got someone who has been able to up there version of the creativescape to connect through the client changing ALL needed ip’s and what not confusing enough he has no idea whats up as he has checked my ip to make sure runelocus etc says the server is running which it says its ONLINE claims that its definatly not due to portforward etc. which i KNOW its not as i can have people connect to a different source hosted by me.</p>
<p>has anyone used this source and got any tips for me it seems that i have changed everything needed proper weird :S</p>
