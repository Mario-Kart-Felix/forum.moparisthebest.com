For whoever doesn&#39;t know what twitter is, it&#39;s sort of like myspace. An 18 year old hacker brute forced a twitter admin&#39;s account, and had access to every twitter account in existence, including Barack Obama, Fox News, and Hannah Montana. (Yay!)

[Quote]Someone used the Obama account to send out a message urging supporters to click on a link to take a survey about the president-elect, and be eligible to win $500 in gasoline. A fake message sent to followers of the Fox News Twitter feed announced that Fox host Bill O&#39;Reilly &quot;is gay,&quot; while a message from Britney Spears&#39; feed made lewd comments about the singer.[/quote]
[Quote]GMZ, who said he&#39;s been hacking for about three years and is currently studying game development, said he conducted the dictionary attack using a script he wrote and used last November to break into the YouTube account of teen queen Miley Cyrus.

That hack gained widespread attention when someone posted a video memorial to Cyrus on the account,  claiming Cyrus had died in a car accident. GMZ said a friend of his was responsible for the hoax. [/quote]</description>
