<p>lols, i didn’t extract the first folder, i extracted the 2nd one :L, and then used sandboxie on the autorestarter and it gave me a .net problem, which then i decompiled it and noticed it was just a keylogger :x, anyways reporting the thread, since this is just a keylogger.</p>

<p>Either way, all you have to do is remove the auto restarter, and you might wanna skim threw the source code to make sure there isn’t anything else :x.</p>
