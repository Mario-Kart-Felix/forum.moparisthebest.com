    <title>Implementing Object Height</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/implementing-object-height/526364</link>
    <description>This snippet is mostly for winterLove servers that are having a problem with objects spawning at every single height level.

I stumped upon this problem when I was re-doing Clan Wars for my server. Basically, when I was spawning the walls in the middle of the map, it would spawn them for every single player. Say I had a game between 2 clans on height 28, and another game on height 12, then if another clan started a game, it would spawn the walls in the middle for all 3 Clan War games, which is pretty bad. I&#39;ve only looked in one source, really, so it might be something only present in my server.

[b]It looks like it&#39;s already half implemented in the server, but it doesn&#39;t work for shit.[/b]

search for
[code]public void updateObject[/code]

in that method, find [code]c.getPA().object(o.newId, o.objectX, o.objectY, o.face, o.type);[/code]

and put this on top [code]if(c.heightLevel == o.height)[/code]


Now search for [code]public void placeObject[/code]

in that method find [code]c.getPA().object(o.objectId, o.objectX, o.objectY, o.face, o.type);[/code]

make that code look somewhat like this
[code]if(c.heightLevel == o.height) {
					if (c.distanceToPoint(o.objectX, o.objectY) &lt;= 60)
						c.getPA().object(o.objectId, o.objectX, o.objectY, o.face, o.type);
				}[/code]

now search for [code]public void loadObjects[/code]

find [code]c.getPA().object(o.objectId, o.objectX, o.objectY, o.face, o.type);[/code]

put this on top [code]if(c.heightLevel == o.height)[/code]



And that should fix any problems you were having. Again, it was only about half implemented, so height is being checked already in some methods.</description>
