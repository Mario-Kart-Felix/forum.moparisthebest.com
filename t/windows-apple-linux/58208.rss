<p>I actually use Dreamweaver for its code view.  It’s upload-on-save feature and ftp access are clinchers, not to mention its built-in validator and browser support check.</p>
<p>And OpenOffice really has nothing on Office 07.</p>
<p>If you can make something like <a href="http://protected.sneamia.net/periodictrends.pdf" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> easily with OpenOffice, maybe I’ll take a look.</p>

<p>Web design.  Don’t think you can find a program that can best Dreamweaver.</p>
<p>And I really don’t think Linux is much stabler.  On Ubuntu Edgy, I’ve had the system just freeze, and not open any windows or respond for quite a while.  Maybe because I’m on edgy, but I don’t see this as more productive or stable.</p>

<p>Quite a few things are much easier in linux than windows, updating, customizing boot options and much much more.  Like Mopman said I can’t think of a single thing that is easier to do on windows than on linux.</p>
<p>I simply mentioned that one could use Wine to run a windows program if they need, but the point I was making is that there is an open source alternative that is 99% of the time better than the proprietary software.</p>
<p>Open source provides a lot of great things besides just knowledge, it makes me feel secure when I know that thousands of programmers from all around the world worked on and approved of the programs I am using.  That is much better than 10 guys at microsoft programming something god-knows-how.</p>

<p>I can’t think of a task that is easier to do on windows than linux… not a single one.</p>
<p>I don’t use linux to be rebellious, I use it because it’s a decent OS, and windows sucks. Windows was maybe built for ease of use, but I prefer productivity and stability, and as I said, there’s nothing that’s easier to do on Windows than Linux now anyway really.</p>

<p>Linux isn’t a ‘non computer persons’ computer. If you have someone who knows nothing about a computer except that the power button turns it on, they won’t understand linux. Windows is the opposite. It’s designed with a UI where everything is layed out for you, and a menu where you can choose to do all the most common tasks in a way designed for speed. (In a sense that the software uses Windows specific API and hardware/kernel features). From a programming aspect, Windows is more UI oriented as well: There’s no equivelant to DirectX on Linux.[/quote]</p>
