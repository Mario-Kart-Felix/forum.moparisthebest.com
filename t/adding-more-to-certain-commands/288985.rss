    <title>Adding more to certain commands?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-more-to-certain-commands/288985</link>
    <description>Ok, I just need help with a few things. 
The first is a does it mater were commands are places in client.java? 
Next goes alone with the first thing, I found a working ::commands on another sourse, does it matter where I place that?
Lastly, how do I put things into the quest tab that when you click on it, it gives you message?
Errr, that&#39;s it for now, TY for anyone that helps.</description>
