    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/drunkbunnys-new-and-improved-sketchbook/448609</link>
    <description>i noticed theres a graphics section now so i decided to post my new and improved sketchbook here.. most of it is game of thrones fan art :P

you&#39;ll notice my signature go from &quot;bw&quot; to &quot;aw&quot; (or that i completely forgot to sign them), thats cause i changed my name haha

theres a ton more portraits between the time those were made and the time these ones below were made.. but i mostly decided to not upload them/delete them since it was more of just a study than actually making fanart.

<p>I did that with the first book, I’d watch an episode then read up the the part where the episode ended, it worked but then I was just like FUCK IT I NEED TO WATCH THEM ALL! because I had little to no time to read compared to watching the show.<br>

<p>When I first watched Game of Thrones I had already read the first book and didn’t even know it was a show x) I watched the entire first season in one night and then started watching the second season regularly.

It’s such an emotional rollercoaster that I’m glad I know whats going to happen, even though seeing it on screen is gonna give me tremendous feels ;_;</p>
<p>despite the emotional effects, GRRM is a brilliant author. ASOIAF/GoT is the best thing I’ve read and watched since LOTR <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Agree completely, and the ending of the second season (from what I watched) made me yell that I have to wait another 200+ days! OMG &gt;_&gt;<br>

yeah joffrey is a total dick in every single episode he’s in. Sansa’s walking away and then smiling was priceless though… and I like Margaery, she was good to Renly and I think she’ll make a more than decent queen. I love how the whole “I want to be THE queen” line from Renly’s death/funeral connected with the story. 10/good for GRRM.</p>
<p>Still not fair we have to wait till march 31st to watch season 3 ;_; I was expecting it in the fall…[/quote]<br>
I didn’t even know they confirmed it until I looked it up.<br>
The last episode was amazing, it tied everything up so perfectly but then again left so much hanging.</p>

I’ve got a friend who would only read parts of the book after he watched the episode, but what with season 3 being aired in an ungodly 246 days, most of the people who do that will probably want to go ahead and read the rest of the book(s).</p>
<p>I just want to finish the series and then re read it one POV at a time… seems pretty cool. :P[/quote]<br>
I did that with the first book, I’d watch an episode then read up the the part where the episode ended, it worked but then I was just like FUCK IT I NEED TO WATCH THEM ALL! because I had little to no time to read compared to watching the show.<br>
Yeah, I’ll probably finish the second book and start a little on the first.</p>

I’m on the second book right now, I like watching them and then reading them, because the show does it so well that I can picture each and every scene right in my head and I can pronounce everything right… I know some say that takes the fun away because you like to see what you see and pronounce the way you like it but he did it so well I wouldn’t want anything changed.[/quote]<br>
