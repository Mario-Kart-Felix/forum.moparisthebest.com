<p>My god. I don’t like High Level programming languages. And that one syntactically makes me want to kill myself. I know High level languages can let you write programs quick and easily. But I’d rather spend 5 extra minutes to write it in a lower level language and have it run more efficiently without the need of some mega compiler to convert that shit into machine code.[/quote]<br>
I also started a language named Scheme. (Based off of LISP) Its basically a more simple LISP.<br>
Here is a loop for that language:</p>
<p><code>
(let main ((i 1)) 
   (if (&lt;= i 10)    
      (begin      
          (display i)(newline)

        <p>[quote=“austinsobes, post:16, topic:436872”]I recommend that you don’t start with any .NET languages. You’ll get used to it and then you’ll realize they are slow and garbage. You’re obviously knew. Grab a book on Java, C++, or Python. Java and Python are recommended languages to start with. C++ should be attempted after you know some good concepts.</p>
<p>Deitel’s books on C++ and Java are really good. I do not recommend Wrox. They say they are for beginners but use terminology that will lose you at sentence one if you are new. I have a book or two on Python, though I haven’t read them and cannot vouch for them. I don’t plan to read them either since Python is a beginners language(I’m aware that it’s a powerful scripting language. but C’mon. CAMOONNNNNNNEEEEE) I personally recommend Deitel’s book on Java. Java is a very powerful language that’s widely used and it’s multiplatform(Can be used all all OS’s). And that being said, it’s still a beginners language so it will be relatively easy for you to learn. it’s also based off of C++, which is based directly from C. So switching between these core languages is very simple and easy in the future.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of the Hello World! application. C# is the only .NET language I included. If you honestly need to use Visual Studio(I do not recommend it whatsoever) then use C#.*</p>
<p>Java</p>
<p><code>
class helloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}</code></p>
<p>C++</p>
<p>[code]<br>
<span class="hashtag">#include</span> </p>
<p>int main()<br>
{<br>
std::cout &lt;&lt; “Hello World!” &lt;&lt; std::endl;<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p>Visual Basic (Might be incorrect)</p>
<p><code>
Module helloWorld
    sub main
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!")
    end sub
end Module</code></p>
<p>C#(C Sharp)(Not including pre-generated using directives/declarations)</p>
<p><code>
class helloWorld
{
    public void Main(String[] Args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}</code></p>
<p>*I do not recommend Visual Studio because for one, it’s not multiplatform. .NET languages only work for Windows and only work if the person using your application has the .NET framework. While an IDE is recommended, I say don’t use one until you need to. It’s good practice to not use an IDE for small projects, this way you don’t rely on help. Use an IDE for huge projects like games and such. My personal favorite application to program in is either NotePad++ for windows, or Gedit for Linux.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Email me or Private message or simply respond in this thread. Always happy to help people new to coding. Though I’m not an expert in all of these languages. I can set you on the right path to learning.[/quote]<br>
there’s nothing wrong with .NET, it’s just platform-limited. also, .NET languages aren’t slow i don’t know which anti-ms fanboy told you that. Python is good for beginners, i’d recommend it over Java, which takes a lot of inspiration from C++ but it is not based on C++ any more than it’s based on smalltalk or C. also, it’s not a beginners language, there’s no such thing as a beginners language, only languages that are easier to pick up for newbies. scripting language is bad terminology (embeddable is more descriptive).</p>
<p>and please sort out those code examples they don’t even follow naming conventions (and the <a href="http://vb.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">VB.NET</a> one is wrong as you guessed). i think you should mention Mono, and IDEs are fine for everything you want to write for as long as you take care to learn that the IDE is built upon more ‘primitive’ tools and understand how these tools work.</p>
<p>[quote=“Daginith, post:17, topic:436872”]May i ask why you didnt include a C example?</p>
<p>Here i got one for ya:</p>
<p>[code]#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>
<p>main() {<br>
printf(“Hello World”);<br>
}[/code][/quote]??? are u a dinosaur from 1980</p>
<p><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    printf("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}</code></p>
<p>[quote=“austinsobes, post:18, topic:436872”]I don’t know C. I would have definitely included it if I learned C. But I think he didn’t really need to know about C, since it’s not based on OOP. OOP is the miracle of programming, especially to new programmers. Most kids these days getting into programming don’t really know how to branch and keep a stable program with linear programming.[/quote]shut up OOP isn’t the cure all solution, it’s just another paradigm and you’re deluded to believe it a miracle. also s/linear/procedural/ -_-</p>
<p>[quote=“Daginith, post:19, topic:436872”]I just started teaching myself LISP 2 weeks ago. Its the second high-level programming language (First is FORTRAN) and it uses a shit load of parentheses.</p>
<p>Here is a simple loop example:</p>

(princ (* i i)) (princ " ")<br>
(setq i (+ i 1))<br>
)<br>
)<br>
[/code][/quote]whoever/whatever is teaching you Lisp, it’s doing it wrong. you haven’t got into the mindset of most lisp programmers where you avoid mutable state. that whole shit using SETQ should either be recursive or use FOR or DOTIMES</p>
<p><code>(dotimes (i 11)
  (princ (* i i))
  (princ " "))</code></p>
<p>also what the hell no, FORTRAN is old, Lisp is old. they’re not high level just because they’re old, in comparison FORTRAN can be a lot lower level than canonical Lisp is.</p>

While an IDE is recommended, I say don't use one until you need to. It's good practice to not use an IDE for small projects, this way you don't rely on help. Use an IDE for huge projects like games and such. My personal favorite application to program in is either NotePad++ for windows, or Gedit for Linux.

I hope this helps. Email me or Private message or simply respond in this thread. Always happy to help people new to coding. Though I'm not an expert in all of these languages. I can set you on the right path to learning.

there's nothing wrong with .NET, it's just platform-limited. also, .NET languages aren't slow i don't know which anti-ms fanboy told you that. Python is good for beginners, i'd recommend it over Java, which takes a lot of inspiration from C++ but it is not based on C++ any more than it's based on smalltalk or C. also, it's not a beginners language, there's no such thing as a beginners language, only languages that are easier to pick up for newbies. scripting language is bad terminology (embeddable is more descriptive).

and please sort out those code examples they don't even follow naming conventions (and the VB.NET one is wrong as you guessed). i think you should mention Mono, and IDEs are fine for everything you want to write for as long as you take care to learn that the IDE is built upon more 'primitive' tools and understand how these tools work.

May i ask why you didnt include a C example?

Here i got one for ya:

[code]#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

main() {    
printf("Hello World");
}[/code]
[/quote]??? are u a dinosaur from 1980
[code=c]#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    printf("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}[/code]

I don't know C. I would have definitely included it if I learned C. But I think he didn't really need to know about C, since it's not based on OOP. OOP is the miracle of programming, especially to new programmers. Most kids these days getting into programming don't really know how to branch and keep a stable program with linear programming.
[/quote]shut up OOP isn't the cure all solution, it's just another paradigm and you're deluded to believe it a miracle. also s/linear/procedural/ -_-

I just started teaching myself LISP 2 weeks ago. Its the second high-level programming language (First is FORTRAN) and it uses a shit load of parentheses.

Here is a simple loop example:
[code](let ( (i 1) )
   (while (&lt;= i 10) 
      (princ (* i i)) (princ " ")
      (setq i (+ i 1))
      )
)</code></pre>
<p>[/quote]whoever/whatever is teaching you Lisp, it’s doing it wrong. you haven’t got into the mindset of most lisp programmers where you avoid mutable state. that whole shit using SETQ should either be recursive or use FOR or DOTIMES</p>
<p><code>(dotimes (i 11)
  (princ (* i i))
  (princ " "))</code></p>
<p>also what the hell no, FORTRAN is old, Lisp is old. they’re not high level just because they’re old, in comparison FORTRAN can be a lot lower level than canonical Lisp is.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>My god. I don’t like High Level programming languages. And that one syntactically makes me want to kill myself. I know High level languages can let you write programs quick and easily. But I’d rather spend 5 extra minutes to write it in a lower level language and have it run more efficiently without the need of some mega compiler to convert that shit into machine code.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>shut up retard, Lisp’s abstraction will own u in the ass and bad performance in high level languages is a myth (plz look at sbcl or stalin scheme)</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>I also started a language named Scheme. (Based off of LISP) Its basically a more simple LISP.<br>
Here is a loop for that language:</p>
<p><code>
(let main ((i 1)) 
   (if (&lt;= i 10)    
      (begin      
          (display i)(newline)

You’re mad because everything you said is completely opinionated and NOT backed by any facts. The .NET languages are slower than most languages.

<p>oh, and if you can program C++ faster than the average <a href="http://vb.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">VB.NET</a> dev then good job, but remember that they like to cheat with form designers, huge APIs and have masses of resources just waiting there. oh, and there’s less to worry about than with languages like C++ where smart pointers and references had to be introduced just to make your life safer! have fun debugging your segfaults. hm, also, if you’re making an FPS in VB then i don’t expect it’s going to be any less performant than all of the C# FPSes out there using XNA or DirectX, and they’re perfectly fine when it comes to performance.</p>
<p>just to put this into perspective, it takes one line to create a threadpool in C# or <a href="http://vb.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">VB.NET</a>. the C++ standard library doesn’t even have a threadpool implementation, so you’ll either use boost or some other library or create a threadpool implementation of your own so you can get to the next task (and this option will take precious time if you want to RAD it out with C++).</p>
<p>i suggest you read up further on the performance of JIT compilation in virtual machines like the CLR or the JVM and how JIT can lead to optimisation choices made dynamically that wouldn’t be possible with C++. but why is performance so damn important to you anyway? most modern applications don’t need the performance, however games do, which is why C++ is used in the games industry (but just look at things that you can use C# in, like Unity, which is becoming extremely popular). it’s losing a foothold everywhere else though.</p>

[/quote]i’m 16, kiddo. you have no professionalism, you have no idea what the industry wants and you’re still at the stage where performance is everything. if you want performance, go write assembly. if you want productivity, use a higher level language that does more for you. i’m still not convinced that you’re seeing my point that syntactical/semantical/grammatical simplicity aren’t qualifications of beginner languages, and i assumed you meant beginners as learners (since most learners are beginners and most beginners are learning; there’s little discernment in this field). i’m not one to enjoy pulling out the fact that i was 9 when i started programming, because i hate the “I WAS EARLIER THAN U” ego-circlejerking but i get the feeling you’re trying to prove something with it. harhar.</p>
<p>oh, and if you can program C++ faster than the average <a href="http://vb.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">VB.NET</a> dev then good job, but remember that they like to cheat with form designers, huge APIs and have masses of resources just waiting there. oh, and there’s less to worry about than with languages like C++ where smart pointers and references had to be introduced just to make your life safer! have fun debugging your segfaults. hm, also, if you’re making an FPS in VB then i don’t expect it’s going to be any less performant than all of the C# FPSes out there using XNA or DirectX, and they’re perfectly fine when it comes to performance.</p>
<p>just to put this into perspective, it takes one line to create a threadpool in C# or <a href="http://vb.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">VB.NET</a>. the C++ standard library doesn’t even have a threadpool implementation, so you’ll either use boost or some other library or create a threadpool implementation of your own so you can get to the next task (and this option will take precious time if you want to RAD it out with C++).</p>
<p>i suggest you read up further on the performance of JIT compilation in virtual machines like the CLR or the JVM and how JIT can lead to optimisation choices made dynamically that wouldn’t be possible with C++. but why is performance so damn important to you anyway? most modern applications don’t need the performance, however games do, which is why C++ is used in the games industry (but just look at things that you can use C# in, like Unity, which is becoming extremely popular). it’s losing a foothold everywhere else though.[/quote]</p>
<p>I see your points quite clearly. And I was also 9 when I started programming &gt;.&gt; Stop being like me. Anyways, I’m making all of my judgments on experience. My core language is C#, and since I’ve been using Java and C++. Even my smaller programs compile much faster and run smoother. I can notice it because I’ve always been about quality. For everything, not just computers and programming. To me, it’s always Quality &gt; Everything else. I’m very aware that a work field will require a good balance between productivity(Or even more of productivity) and quality/efficiency. I’ve had to do this for numerous situations at school and work. I’m only advising a newcomer that a lot of corporate business’s don’t like to use Windows. It’s expensive and isn’t even the best option. A lot of high ranking business’s use Unix systems and VB/C# won’t always be available. Yeah, Mono is an option. I’ve used it a few times. but it’s not perfect. All I’m saying is that languages like Java, C++ and such are better since they are multiplatform.</p>
<p>And you put quite a twist on my words. “most learners are beginners and most beginners are learning”</p>
<p>I’m still very much learning after 4 years. All the time. new syntax. new language. new algorithms. new methods. etc…</p>
<p>But to my current knowledge of terminology.<br>
Beginner = New To programming<br>
Learning = New to your mind</p>
<p>I’m going to stop responding. I’m pretty sure I have more to say. But my arm feels funny.</p>

<p>i suggest you read up further on the performance of JIT compilation in virtual machines like the CLR or the JVM and how JIT can lead to optimisation choices made dynamically that wouldn’t be possible with C++. but why is performance so damn important to you anyway? most modern applications don’t need the performance, however games do, which is why C++ is used in the games industry (but just look at things that you can use C# in, like Unity, which is becoming extremely popular). it’s losing a foothold everywhere else though.</p>

<p>I see your points quite clearly. And I was also 9 when I started programming &gt;.&gt; Stop being like me. Anyways, I’m making all of my judgments on experience. My core language is C#, and since I’ve been using Java and C++. Even my smaller programs compile much faster and run smoother. I can notice it because I’ve always been about quality. For everything, not just computers and programming. To me, it’s always Quality &gt; Everything else. I’m very aware that a work field will require a good balance between productivity(Or even more of productivity) and quality/efficiency. I’ve had to do this for numerous situations at school and work. I’m only advising a newcomer that a lot of corporate business’s don’t like to use Windows. It’s expensive and isn’t even the best option. A lot of high ranking business’s use Unix systems and VB/C# won’t always be available. Yeah, Mono is an option. I’ve used it a few times. but it’s not perfect. All I’m saying is that languages like Java, C++ and such are better since they are multiplatform.</p>
<p>And you put quite a twist on my words. “most learners are beginners and most beginners are learning”</p>
<p>I’m still very much learning after 4 years. All the time. new syntax. new language. new algorithms. new methods. etc…</p>
<p>But to my current knowledge of terminology.<br>
Beginner = New To programming<br>
Learning = New to your mind</p>
<p>I’m going to stop responding. I’m pretty sure I have more to say. But my arm feels funny.[/quote]so you started in 09, you’re 15 now… but you were 9. wait, either you’re lying or you were 12/13 or… whatthefuck.</p>
<p>experience? i bet you’ve got so much of that :p! also, i think you’ll find the majority of corporations do actually use windows more, it’s the more adventurous ones that use linux for more than just servers. that is one thing i dislike about .NET is that it’s not portable (i only use linux so it annoys me sometimes) but i don’t see why it should be dismissed based entirely on the single-platform nature of the .NET framework and that it’s slow, when all the benchmarks seem to dispel that. languages being better is completely based upon opinion, and i’m firmly of the belief that the .NET framework is one of the better ideas if you’re targeting windows, and contrarily, using java or c/c++ with multiplatform libraries is a better idea for cross-platform development. there’s no universally better thing.</p>
<p>and programmers never stop learning (hopefully), but you don’t tend to refer to someone as a learner when they have many years of experience. it’s just part of the discipline that you learn something new all the time.</p>

I just started teaching myself LISP 2 weeks ago. Its the second high-level programming language (First is FORTRAN) and it uses a shit load of parentheses.</p>
<p>Here is a simple loop example:</p>
<p><a title="(i 1">code</a><br>
(while (&lt;= i 10)<br>
(princ (* i i)) (princ " ")<br>
(setq i (+ i 1))<br>
)<br>
)<br>
[/code]<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>My god. I don’t like High Level programming languages. And that one syntactically makes me want to kill myself. I know High level languages can let you write programs quick and easily. But I’d rather spend 5 extra minutes to write it in a lower level language and have it run more efficiently without the need of some mega compiler to convert that shit into machine code.[/quote]<br>
java, c++ and python are high level languages fyi</p>
<p>ruby, easy as shit.</p>

<p>I understand you’re about equality. But you’re also making accusations. I DO have real work experience. I’m already a paid programmer. I’m on the internet, I’m wearing a mask. I can do/say whatever I want without repercussions so long as what I’m doing is legal. I’m actually VERY smart and EXTREMELY talented. Why don’t I seem like it? Well, by your logic, you are only looking at snippets of my knowledge. My teachers have told me straight to my face that I’m already a better programmer than they are. (I went to a robotics conference for programming the Aldebaraan Human Interface Robots that wasn’t even for teenagers. You know attended that conference? 3 Graduates from MIT, a professor from MIT, and 2 professors from Notre Dame, not included graduates from other colleges I forgot. They helped train me one on one in robotics and application programming.) My mathematical skills are superb, so are my algorithmic skills. My memory is extremely vivid and allows me to memorize syntax easy. I memorized 70% or more of the entire C# language in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>I don’t believe I ever said that my skills surpassed yours. I haven’t seen any of your code or programs to judge your actual skill.</p>
<p>Why do I boast a lot? Because I’m the nerd at school. I’m harassed and made fun of. By you know what? As far as I’ve been told, I have good looks and I’m extremely smart and talented with a computer. I boast because it boosts my confidence.</p>
<p>I’m a good programmer. I wouldn’t say great because I’m not finished learning. I’ve still got a nice amount to learn. I’d eventually like to get down to a hardware level where I can completely program my own operating system(Not alone, of course). But I have been paid to make programs for local business’s and have even helped my School District with White-Hat hacking. I found an easy exploit that they overlooked and I told them about it and received commendation for it.</p>
<p>You don’t have to believe me. I’m 15, in all honesty I expect you to call utter bullshit. You are listening to a mask.</p>

<p>I corrected myself in that post. I was think of your '09 signature segment. I’ve been programming since I was 9 years old. More technically, I started scripting when I was 9. Didn’t actually start programming till about 11 years old. And I do have plenty of experience. I’ve been extremely lucky in my career so far. I’m not going to tell you about it, because while you are still older than be by however long, you’re still probably an immature fuck on mopar(no offense ;3) that will call bullshit on everything that surpasses you even by a hair. If not, then disregard that statement. But I’m very experienced.</p>
<p>I’ve been programming for a solid 4 years now, and I still consider myself a learner. I like to collect massive amounts of knowledge about anything and everything. I’m especially interested(obviously) in programming. It’s always been a natural talent. I was self taught up until last year when I joined a vocational highschool with a Microsoft IT program(How ironic…).</p>
<p>But I dismiss the .NET languages simply because their not Multiplatform. I’ve used them up until recently(C# being my primary language of choice). But I’ve grown extremely tired of Microsoft and Windows and the general bullshit I have to go through. So I switched to linux. C# barely had compatibility with the way i needed it. I ragequit. Started learning C++ and got more into java. They work wherever i need them to.</p>
<p>I realize my spelling is terrible as shit. So is my grammar. I’m out of it today. Had a lot to deal with. Exhausted. So I apologize for any difficulties reading my shit english in the past or future.<br>
[/quote]scripting? programmatically extending/modifying preexisting software? programming how the web browser reacts depending upon interaction? ‘scripting’ is programming, you’ve been programming since 9. i’m not calling bullshit on it, but i don’t see how it surpasses me in any way or form purely because the whole “I STARTED ERLIER LOL!” circlejerk proves nothing but one’s insecurity. i find it ironic how you claim to be mature yet blow accusatives and questions about my own integrity everywhere and you must be an extremely experienced programmer if you’re able to see a language’s elegance through a code snippet alone (hint hint Lisp, why do you look at syntax based purely on what’s immediately present and not what’s consistently present. uniformity is the point there)</p>
<p>also, nice career i’m sure you have, 15 year olds are renowned for having prosperous and upcoming careers. also, you have a natural ability in programming? cool, that is <span class="bbcode-i">very</span> impressive i am sure you are the top of your Microsoft IT Program. reality check! want some tips for the future? 1) you’re no more special, smart or talented than the rest of us 2) boastfulness gets you nowhere 3) pretentiousness gets you nowhere 4) unquantified and unproven ‘facts’ like .NET IS SLOW only make you look blind and/or stupid</p>

<p>You don’t have to believe me. I’m 15, in all honesty I expect you to call utter bullshit. You are listening to a mask.[/quote]it’s funny how you claim to be one all for robotics and AI and yet Lisp is a completely foreign thing to you; Lisp has and always had a ridiculous amount of appeal with the AI community because of runtime mutation of code that the code-as-data &amp; homoiconicity paradigms allow, as well as the ridiculously powerful macro systems. to illustrate code as data:</p>
<p>[code=lisp](defconstant <em>our-datacode</em> '(+ 1 2))</p>
<p>(format t “expression: ~S~%operation: ~S~%evaluated: ~D~%”<br>
<em>our-datacode</em><br>
(car <em>our-datacode</em>)<br>
(eval <em>our-datacode</em>))[/code]<br>
which will result in</p>
<p><code>expression: (+ 1 2)
operation: +
evaluated: 3</code></p>
<p>yep, this language sure is “You’re purposely trying to make me cringe.”-worthy.</p>
<p>i don’t doubt that you’re smart, talented w/e but that’s no reason to be boastful and you haven’t really shown what you know because you’ve been too busy being objectionable with your unproven facts (.NET IS SLOW!!!, FASTEST C++ CODER EVAR), poor arguments (MONOPLATFORM IS BAD EVEN IF YOU ONLY TARGET ONE PLATFORM, COMPILATION MODEL BAD!!) and downright ignorance of a language based purely on the fact that it has a weird syntax quirk (yet is something that was fundamental as to why you see the AI advancements that you do today). syntax memorisation isn’t hard either, and C# doesn’t have an overly complex syntax, and in the end learning syntax is eventually picked up by everyone. may i ask why you qualify a great programmer as someone that has stopped learning? i don’t suppose great programmers exist then, because even the best never stop learning (which was even part of your argument earlier ~_~). also, lol’d at white-hat hacking; sure, finding one easy exploit surely qualifies you there.</p>
<p>if you want to start with OS development then go to <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page" rel="nofollow noopener">http://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page</a>, it’s something that i’ve dedicated a lot of time to over the past few years.</p>
