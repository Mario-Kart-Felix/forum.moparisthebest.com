<p>I corrected myself in that post. I was think of your '09 signature segment. I’ve been programming since I was 9 years old. More technically, I started scripting when I was 9. Didn’t actually start programming till about 11 years old. And I do have plenty of experience. I’ve been extremely lucky in my career so far. I’m not going to tell you about it, because while you are still older than be by however long, you’re still probably an immature fuck on mopar(no offense ;3) that will call bullshit on everything that surpasses you even by a hair. If not, then disregard that statement. But I’m very experienced.</p>
<p>I’ve been programming for a solid 4 years now, and I still consider myself a learner. I like to collect massive amounts of knowledge about anything and everything. I’m especially interested(obviously) in programming. It’s always been a natural talent. I was self taught up until last year when I joined a vocational highschool with a Microsoft IT program(How ironic…).</p>
<p>But I dismiss the .NET languages simply because their not Multiplatform. I’ve used them up until recently(C# being my primary language of choice). But I’ve grown extremely tired of Microsoft and Windows and the general bullshit I have to go through. So I switched to linux. C# barely had compatibility with the way i needed it. I ragequit. Started learning C++ and got more into java. They work wherever i need them to.</p>
<p>I realize my spelling is terrible as shit. So is my grammar. I’m out of it today. Had a lot to deal with. Exhausted. So I apologize for any difficulties reading my shit english in the past or future.<br>
[/quote]scripting? programmatically extending/modifying preexisting software? programming how the web browser reacts depending upon interaction? ‘scripting’ is programming, you’ve been programming since 9. i’m not calling bullshit on it, but i don’t see how it surpasses me in any way or form purely because the whole “I STARTED ERLIER LOL!” circlejerk proves nothing but one’s insecurity. i find it ironic how you claim to be mature yet blow accusatives and questions about my own integrity everywhere and you must be an extremely experienced programmer if you’re able to see a language’s elegance through a code snippet alone (hint hint Lisp, why do you look at syntax based purely on what’s immediately present and not what’s consistently present. uniformity is the point there)</p>
<p>also, nice career i’m sure you have, 15 year olds are renowned for having prosperous and upcoming careers. also, you have a natural ability in programming? cool, that is <span class="bbcode-i">very</span> impressive i am sure you are the top of your Microsoft IT Program. reality check! want some tips for the future? 1) you’re no more special, smart or talented than the rest of us 2) boastfulness gets you nowhere 3) pretentiousness gets you nowhere 4) unquantified and unproven ‘facts’ like .NET IS SLOW only make you look blind and/or stupid</p>
<p>i respect that you’re an eager programmer and you want to solve the worlds problems with code, but you have to remember that you’re 15. i’m no better, i’m 16. most of us are kids, we don’t have experience of the real world that we’ll eventually meet. we’re not good programmers, we simply haven’t had enough time to become good ones (you may laugh and say that i’m speaking for myself, so be it, you’ll figure it out yourself when you’re thrown into a workplace dick-first).</p>

<p>I understand you’re about equality. But you’re also making accusations. I DO have real work experience. I’m already a paid programmer. I’m on the internet, I’m wearing a mask. I can do/say whatever I want without repercussions so long as what I’m doing is legal. I’m actually VERY smart and EXTREMELY talented. Why don’t I seem like it? Well, by your logic, you are only looking at snippets of my knowledge. My teachers have told me straight to my face that I’m already a better programmer than they are. (I went to a robotics conference for programming the Aldebaraan Human Interface Robots that wasn’t even for teenagers. You know attended that conference? 3 Graduates from MIT, a professor from MIT, and 2 professors from Notre Dame, not included graduates from other colleges I forgot. They helped train me one on one in robotics and application programming.) My mathematical skills are superb, so are my algorithmic skills. My memory is extremely vivid and allows me to memorize syntax easy. I memorized 70% or more of the entire C# language in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>I don’t believe I ever said that my skills surpassed yours. I haven’t seen any of your code or programs to judge your actual skill.</p>
<p>Why do I boast a lot? Because I’m the nerd at school. I’m harassed and made fun of. By you know what? As far as I’ve been told, I have good looks and I’m extremely smart and talented with a computer. I boast because it boosts my confidence.</p>
<p>I’m a good programmer. I wouldn’t say great because I’m not finished learning. I’ve still got a nice amount to learn. I’d eventually like to get down to a hardware level where I can completely program my own operating system(Not alone, of course). But I have been paid to make programs for local business’s and have even helped my School District with White-Hat hacking. I found an easy exploit that they overlooked and I told them about it and received commendation for it.</p>
<p>You don’t have to believe me. I’m 15, in all honesty I expect you to call utter bullshit. You are listening to a mask.[/quote]<br>
I think you are better than you really are. You say that your the best and know everything, and yet never heard of LISP or SCHEME. In robotics, the language LISP is a way better choice for the programs (Even though I’m new to LISP, i can see this). LISP is a List Programming language that is able to be interpreted rather than  compiled, (although Common LISP is compiled, to my understanding)</p>
<p>I have been programming for quite some time now. Started when i was 9 or 10 with HTML/CSS, moved on to PHP. And then C/C++, JAVA, LISP, and so on. I even had ‘hacked’ my school (Simply bypassed the mainframe to give myself admin powers.) I had the ability to take students out of the system. Change my grades. ANYTHING. But guess what i did? I used it so i can install compilers and use them at school. Not bad at all. When i was finally caught, the principal of the school was REALLY pissed that i did that. But the IT team was rather impressed. I found out that one of the guys was a White Hat hacker in his time off. Eventually after school he taught me a lot about systems, hacking, and mainly programming in scripting languages like PYTHON/RUBY. Guess what? I’m 15 like your self.</p>
<p>Why did i tell you this? Because you think your the shit. We all have past experiences. I didn’t tell all of this to say “im better than you, i’ve been doing this longer”. No. You go around thinking your better than everyone in this community because you dont know their back-storys (so-to-speak)</p>
<p>Even with everything i know, I never thought i was way better than anyone, I just sit back, and see what new things people can teach me. Not brag about it and get yelled at for it.</p>
<p>Like _S had said, if you want to get into something better, do OS dev. I helped out a OS dev team a few times here and there. It gives you a good experience, and teaches you a lot more than any book or video ever could.</p>
<p>I bet you didn’t read all of that, but if there is one thing you will take back from this it is: Don’t let what you know get in the way of what you can learn. Let people teach you new things, and don’t get back at them with smart-ass replies, rather accept the fact that you don’t know everything, and be open to learn.</p>

That simple of a program will run without it, i just made it simple. if it makes you feel better, you can add ‘return: 0;’ <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
or refer to the one that _s had posted.</p>

<p>I realize my spelling is terrible as shit. So is my grammar. I’m out of it today. Had a lot to deal with. Exhausted. So I apologize for any difficulties reading my shit english in the past or future.<br>
[/quote]scripting? programmatically extending/modifying preexisting software? programming how the web browser reacts depending upon interaction? ‘scripting’ is programming, you’ve been programming since 9. i’m not calling bullshit on it, but i don’t see how it surpasses me in any way or form purely because the whole “I STARTED ERLIER LOL!” circlejerk proves nothing but one’s insecurity. i find it ironic how you claim to be mature yet blow accusatives and questions about my own integrity everywhere and you must be an extremely experienced programmer if you’re able to see a language’s elegance through a code snippet alone (hint hint Lisp, why do you look at syntax based purely on what’s immediately present and not what’s consistently present. uniformity is the point there)</p>
<p>also, nice career i’m sure you have, 15 year olds are renowned for having prosperous and upcoming careers. also, you have a natural ability in programming? cool, that is <span class="bbcode-i">very</span> impressive i am sure you are the top of your Microsoft IT Program. reality check! want some tips for the future? 1) you’re no more special, smart or talented than the rest of us 2) boastfulness gets you nowhere 3) pretentiousness gets you nowhere 4) unquantified and unproven ‘facts’ like .NET IS SLOW only make you look blind and/or stupid</p>
<p>i respect that you’re an eager programmer and you want to solve the worlds problems with code, but you have to remember that you’re 15. i’m no better, i’m 16. most of us are kids, we don’t have experience of the real world that we’ll eventually meet. we’re not good programmers, we simply haven’t had enough time to become good ones (you may laugh and say that i’m speaking for myself, so be it, you’ll figure it out yourself when you’re thrown into a workplace dick-first).</p>

<p>I understand you’re about equality. But you’re also making accusations. I DO have real work experience. I’m already a paid programmer. I’m on the internet, I’m wearing a mask. I can do/say whatever I want without repercussions so long as what I’m doing is legal. I’m actually VERY smart and EXTREMELY talented. Why don’t I seem like it? Well, by your logic, you are only looking at snippets of my knowledge. My teachers have told me straight to my face that I’m already a better programmer than they are. (I went to a robotics conference for programming the Aldebaraan Human Interface Robots that wasn’t even for teenagers. You know attended that conference? 3 Graduates from MIT, a professor from MIT, and 2 professors from Notre Dame, not included graduates from other colleges I forgot. They helped train me one on one in robotics and application programming.) My mathematical skills are superb, so are my algorithmic skills. My memory is extremely vivid and allows me to memorize syntax easy. I memorized 70% or more of the entire C# language in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>I don’t believe I ever said that my skills surpassed yours. I haven’t seen any of your code or programs to judge your actual skill.</p>
<p>Why do I boast a lot? Because I’m the nerd at school. I’m harassed and made fun of. By you know what? As far as I’ve been told, I have good looks and I’m extremely smart and talented with a computer. I boast because it boosts my confidence.</p>
<p>I’m a good programmer. I wouldn’t say great because I’m not finished learning. I’ve still got a nice amount to learn. I’d eventually like to get down to a hardware level where I can completely program my own operating system(Not alone, of course). But I have been paid to make programs for local business’s and have even helped my School District with White-Hat hacking. I found an easy exploit that they overlooked and I told them about it and received commendation for it.</p>
<p>You don’t have to believe me. I’m 15, in all honesty I expect you to call utter bullshit. You are listening to a mask.<br>
[/quote]it’s funny how you claim to be one all for robotics and AI and yet Lisp is a completely foreign thing to you; Lisp has and always had a ridiculous amount of appeal with the AI community because of runtime mutation of code that the code-as-data &amp; homoiconicity paradigms allow, as well as the ridiculously powerful macro systems. to illustrate code as data:</p>
<p>[code=lisp](defconstant <em>our-datacode</em> '(+ 1 2))</p>
<p>(format t “expression: ~S~%operation: ~S~%evaluated: ~D~%”<br>
<em>our-datacode</em><br>
(car <em>our-datacode</em>)<br>
(eval <em>our-datacode</em>))[/code]<br>
which will result in</p>
<p><code>expression: (+ 1 2)
operation: +
evaluated: 3</code></p>
<p>yep, this language sure is “You’re purposely trying to make me cringe.”-worthy.</p>
<p>i don’t doubt that you’re smart, talented w/e but that’s no reason to be boastful and you haven’t really shown what you know because you’ve been too busy being objectionable with your unproven facts (.NET IS SLOW!!!, FASTEST C++ CODER EVAR), poor arguments (MONOPLATFORM IS BAD EVEN IF YOU ONLY TARGET ONE PLATFORM, COMPILATION MODEL BAD!!) and downright ignorance of a language based purely on the fact that it has a weird syntax quirk (yet is something that was fundamental as to why you see the AI advancements that you do today). syntax memorisation isn’t hard either, and C# doesn’t have an overly complex syntax, and in the end learning syntax is eventually picked up by everyone. may i ask why you qualify a great programmer as someone that has stopped learning? i don’t suppose great programmers exist then, because even the best never stop learning (which was even part of your argument earlier ~_~). also, lol’d at white-hat hacking; sure, finding one easy exploit surely qualifies you there.</p>
<p>if you want to start with OS development then go to <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page" rel="nofollow noopener">http://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page</a>, it’s something that i’ve dedicated a lot of time to over the past few years.[/quote]</p>
<p>I never said I was a White-Hat hacker. I said that I partook in White-Hat activities. And I never said that you aren’t a great programmer unless you’ve stopped learning. I also never said I was the fastest C++ coder ever either, I simply said I was able to program fast because of how easy it is for me to process things. Also, LISP looks gross. Don’t give a fuck about learning it for that reason only. Am I stupid because of that? probably. But one language probably won’t matter. Considering that a good majority of programming jobs are using C#, C++, Java, Python, and Ruby. And even apart from that, I planned to start my own ‘company’ I guess you could call it. Business and shit isn’t my thing just yet. But I plan to write software and probably get into gaming very soon.</p>
<p>It’s irrelevant, but after I learned how to communicate at the lowest level. I plan to write a small graphic OS. If that is a successful project I planned to try to make my own gaming console. And then if that basic console was a success I’d keep remaking newer and better versions until I created my own gaming console that would match up to say, a gamecube or a classic xbox(Of course without hundreds of games and companies to produce). I’ve got dreams and I’m very dedicated to them.</p>

I know I don’t know everything. I’m still learning. I read all of that. My experience is somewhat the same, though I wasn’t able to change my grades and shit. I was able to install compilers for Java which I used to help teach a few of my friends the basics. I have no idea where I am going with this. I learn all the time. As a matter of fact, while you all have been blasting out spiteful replies. I’ve been taking in everything you’ve said. But the chances of me admitting that before hand were extremely low.</p>

your literal interpretation of my silly hyperbole aside,</p>
<blockquote>I wouldn't say great because I'm not finished learning.</blockquote> implies somewhat that 'finishing learning' would be a clause for achievement of being a great programmer and that all great programmers would have had to have finished learning :p
<p>Lisp looks gross to the untrained eye, but code in general looks gross to the untrained eye. to appreciate the beauty of code you must be able to understand it, and likewise to appreciate Lisp you must allow the same liberty. the stance you take on programming languages is fine if you want to remain stuck using imperative languages for your whole life (and there’s very little to learn from imperative programming since imperativeness is natural to us anyway), but Lisp allows you to program functionally which is a good idea if you want to understand and create alternative (read: sometimes better) solutions to problems. (disclaimer: Lisp can be extended to support pretty much any other paradigm too. see: CLOS, various Prolog-in-lisp implementations).</p>
<p>for companies and on the topic of Lisp, may i suggest some of Paul Graham’s ‘essays’, notably <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a>. please read this!! it’s cool that you want to make a startup (who doesn’t nowadays), but you have to be realistic with dreams. making something like the XBox or GameCube entirely on your own will be very very very difficult.</p>
