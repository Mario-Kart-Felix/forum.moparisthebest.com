    <title>Where to start from?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-to-start-from/465217</link>
    <description>Hey guys! I&#39;m sure you guys get this question quite a lot but anyways...

I&#39;m just wondering, speaking from absolutely no Java experience. Where I can start from, in the sense that Iwant to be able to code private servers. 

I have tried in the past to use basic snippets and tutorials to add to a blank source, and found myself not learning anything. I want to be able to expand, improve or even make my own coding. 

So I guess my question is... Where did you start? Did you just jump into the RSPS scene and learn from code tutorials/snippets? Or did you have previous Java experience?
I
I&#39;m currently studying a basic Java guide, hoping to expand my knowledge in this field.

If you have any suggestions, or material that would greatly benefit me, as it did you, I would be very appreciative.

EDIT: I just re-read the rules, oops, I didn&#39;t mean to post in the wrong section. Sorry, if someone could move it to the proper section that would be appreciated.</description>

<p>you don’t necessarily need to “know” java to “code rsps”, what constitutes “coding rsps” is merely copying and pasting code that other have created (which in itself is really quite basic) into a server, compiling and running</p>
