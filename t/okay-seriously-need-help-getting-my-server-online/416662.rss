              <p>Go to your desktop.<br>
Start &gt; Search for ‘CMD’ (A command prompt will appear) &gt; Type in ‘ipconfig’ &gt; Copy the last IP displayed in the command prompt (Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1) &gt; Open up your Internet Connection &gt; Type in that IP in the Adress Bar &gt; Press Enter and your Router Information should display. You should see something like ‘Wireless’ and ‘Portforwarding’.<br>
Everything coming after this is common sence, I guess.</p>
