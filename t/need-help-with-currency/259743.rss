    <description>Hey, I&#39;m testing out a PvP source, and I want to create a shop in which you buy items with your PvP points. For each kill you get, one point is added to your cumulative points. I want it so that if I have 5 points, and a santa hat costs 4 points, I can buy it and still have 1 point left.

Thanks in advance!
