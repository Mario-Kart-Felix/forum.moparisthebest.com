[u][i][b]SERVER UPDATES[/b][/i][/u]

[i][b]There has been new items added , all your favorite bosses are back, and we even have introduced DUO SLAYER!!!!

Tired of slaying by yourself, wish you had a friend with you? Try out DUO SLAYER!!!! You each get the same task at a higher amount of monsters to kill, work together to beat them all. While in a duo slayer task you also gain 1.25x the normal exp rate.

We have a new homepage layout as well as updates every week. Our next event is going to be on Thanksgiving.

On Halloween we just introduced masks into the server, so at around Christmas time phats may be introduced into the game so there is still time to get rares in Dodian.

[b][i][u][color=red]THE IN GAME BOSSES[/color][/u][/i][/b]

Santojolan - He drops dragon weapons and armour , legends cape , the orange key (which is used to get to The Black Knight Titan) as well as a ship ticket (used to get to the new boss Slash Bash) He is located downstairs in the house located next to the smithing house in Yanille.
