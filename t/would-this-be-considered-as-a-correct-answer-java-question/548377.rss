    <title>Would this be considered as a correct answer? Java question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-this-be-considered-as-a-correct-answer-java-question/548377</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;In the following Java statement, what does the [b]placeholder[/b] do?

System.out.printf(&quot;*%-4d*\n*====*&quot;, width*height);

Tick exactly three answers&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here were the options:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Display a String value
Display the value aligned to the left
Display an integer value
Displays the value aligned to the right
Display a decimal point value
Displays the value aligned with a minimum of 4 columns
Displays the value aligned with a maximum of 4 columns&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now considering all of the answers say &quot;display&quot; and no other information was given, I assumed this was printed to the console and it&#39;s asking what does the answer give.

They did not accept the answer &quot;Display a String value&quot;. Now doesn&#39;t the System.out or PrintStream convert everything to a String when it&#39;s displaying output, regardless of whether it&#39;s first an integer or not? So if this was called, the output, as well as the placeholder would be converted to a String. So when the output is displayed, the placeholder would &quot;Display a String value&quot;

Baring in mind this an introductory course and a university level question, and they marked me down for this answer giving me 0/3, as all answers must be correct to obtain the 3 marks. Am I right to argue it?

I would totally understand if they re-worded all of the answers to &quot;holds&quot; but &quot;display&quot; implies that it&#39;s going to be displayed in the console window right?

I&#39;m not too fussed, if I got it wrong I got it wrong but it&#39;s just one of those things I thought I&#39;d clarify with people who know their stuff.</description>

The placeholder doesn’t display a string value, read the question.<br>

<p>Yeah I see but even after it’s printed out, isn’t the whole output a String, including the placeholder[/quote]<br>
Yes, Java converts it to a string yes. This is what the question was looking for: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string#Type" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string#Type</a><br>
%-4d is a decimal placeholder and takes a decimal number (weigth*height). %s is a string placeholder and would have to be included for “Display a String value” to be correct.  If something is confusing in a question you should ask for clarification.</p>
