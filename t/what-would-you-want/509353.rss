    <title>What would you want?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-would-you-want/509353</link>
    <description>What would you want from EoC features(items, quests, minigames, etc.) that isn&#39;t already in RS2007?

Me personally, I would really enjoy the money pouch. It&#39;s a great thing they added.
Most of the quests have huge rewards, but they make a great storyline. I think if they toned them down, they&#39;d also be good.


I would just like to hear everyone&#39;s thoughts and opinions on this.</description>

              <p>Meh, I know a lot of people who are bored with EoC because of lack of content, rather then mad that it’s too easy, etc.</p>
<p>I do like both versions of the game, and I would really like to hear more things people want, rather than people who say “I’m fine with how it is”.</p>
