    <title>Model a completely new area?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/model-a-completely-new-area/266514</link>
    <description>Okay, so I want to have a custom home - i real custom home.

Jagex can create new area&#39;s, so we can right?

I want to know how I would go about making a new area, setting coords etc.

I mean, say I&#39;ve found a patch I would like to make a new area on, it&#39;s completely black and you can&#39;t move unless you noclip, how would I make a floor and walls and make a new area for my home.

I realize this question may only be answerable by a few very knowledgable people, and I haven&#39;t set my hopes too high. But if someone can help me out by explaning this, I would appreciate it!

<p>Is this the wrong forum section for this question then?</p>
<p>Okay well anyway, you’ve shed some light onto my question, so thank you.</p>
<p>So say Jagex thought up of a new random event and needed to create a new place for it. How would they go about it? Would THEY create mapdata from scratch?</p>
