    <title>RSC Server Combined Effort? Do it</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsc-server-combined-effort-do-it/448998</link>
    <description>Was on the RSCA topic and noticed this...

&quot;I think this is great for the RSC community. COMPETITION!
We got Pomp coming out with a server he&#39;s put a lot of money into.
Pyru will be starting RSCD with possibly the best source ever created.
KO9 &amp; xEnt bringing back one of the best servers ever!

If you&#39;re an RSC player this is great news and you should be excited!
May the best server win!&quot;

The post got me thinking why can&#39;t they all just combine their efforts and create one awesome server.  I realize they probably wouldn&#39;t want to work with Pomp, no disrespect from me but they just don&#39;t seem to like him. I&#39;m sure he could see why, just as others do.

The source Zilent and Luke worked on combined with Pyru &amp; KO9 as admin sounds like a great server.  Zilent is one of the best at what he does and KO9 is arguably the best admin of RSC, all while Pyru designs the best website.  I don&#39;t know anyone that doesn&#39;t like Dustin or appreciate what he&#39;s done and Zilent mostly keeps to himself, for he just wants to make a great and successful server.

Why must we be forced to choose between the servers?  It fucking sucks having to make a decision and for the entire RSC community as a whole being split between servers.  It&#39;s like America, having to choose between which party to be apart of an all.  Just makes no sense.

Let&#39;s see the big picture here.  One awesome server would certainly bring in plenty of cash for the admins, afterall it is their time being put in to run a server and of course compensation for developers who work on the server.  I really could care less if admins get paid (same thing with college football - to drop that in).  With all of them combining to make one server there is no way it could fail and would easily see 300+ people.

Combine the efforts and make this happen...idgaf if KO9 may have ulterior motives, such as getting paid.  Fuck it, get paid and let us play.</description>

First of all I’m going to say this. Every “head” admin right now is corrupt and are scumbags. First we go to RSCE… Pyru: This kid hands out free 99 flats, party hats and items like its candy. Luke: He sold so much stuff for IRL it’s unreal. Tons of party hats, tons of GP, tons of 99s. I would understand it, if it was for the server. But he didn’t need money for TEH SEBERS because there was so many SUBS! It’s kinda obvious he did this when he would wipe so many items in-game when they haven’t been logged in for ONLY a month.</p>
<p>Now let’s go to RSCA. Xent: If this mother fucker has a kid, he will give up on that kid the first week. Enough said. Ko9 has nothing to bring to the table. He’s a fucking hypocrite and he really has no idea about anything. He gave up on RSCA so many times and he claims Luke was the one who killed it, get it together bud.</p>
<p>Now lets go to PROJECT RSC!! Tim/Swoosh: Really has no credibility, this mother fucker has scammed and hacked pretty much every server who’s been released. Every server we released with him, he pretty much handed out party hats and flat 99s to his friends. He also gave bug stats to his friends for staking. Zorian: Do I need to say much about this kid? He’s the ultimate 10 year old. Jokes around constantly, fucks around constantly and doesn’t think it effects anything. He also hands out free stuff like its candy. Pompano: This motha fucka is probably the only legit 1 of them all, but he has done some shit but it was just to get the server ahead and stay online I suppose. Selling party hats and flat 99s for cash, but it was for the server so i suppose it’s ALL GUD.</p>
<p>Also I must mention, I seen all of this first hand. They did it in front of me and for me.[/quote]</p>
<p>Luke is gone. Who cares what he’s done?</p>

              <p>I agree with All Day.  It’s infuriating hearing all the talk about servers opening only to be disappointed because the launch dates are pushed back.  Truth is a lot of that can be blamed on lack of commitment or overconfidence in one’s ability to produce a solid server.</p>
<p>About a year and a half back on RSCE many people wanted to have the server completely wiped.  Since i was still modding then Luke told me to not agree with those people and don’t post in favor of them.  Truth was I sort of liked the idea of a wipe, but not entirely.</p>
<p>However, things are far different and worse off than before and I believe a complete wipe on RSCE would be good.  There is truly. I point, no purpose of being on RSCE.  I just starting playing again two days ago and the vibe is all dead.  The risk is losing the player base, but its worth a shot.</p>

From rsca I remember people smacktalking on the forums, fighting over skellies, pking, raging, all of which is what I’m looking for in a rsc server.<br>
Of course, I’ve nothing to show for playing rsca or any of the other servers, but if memories arent why you’re playing rsc, why play at all?</p>
