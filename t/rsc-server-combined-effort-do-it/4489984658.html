First of all I’m going to say this. Every “head” admin right now is corrupt and are scumbags. First we go to RSCE… Pyru: This kid hands out free 99 flats, party hats and items like its candy. Luke: He sold so much stuff for IRL it’s unreal. Tons of party hats, tons of GP, tons of 99s. I would understand it, if it was for the server. But he didn’t need money for TEH SEBERS because there was so many SUBS! It’s kinda obvious he did this when he would wipe so many items in-game when they haven’t been logged in for ONLY a month.</p>
<p>Now let’s go to RSCA. Xent: If this mother fucker has a kid, he will give up on that kid the first week. Enough said. Ko9 has nothing to bring to the table. He’s a fucking hypocrite and he really has no idea about anything. He gave up on RSCA so many times and he claims Luke was the one who killed it, get it together bud.</p>
<p>Now lets go to PROJECT RSC!! Tim/Swoosh: Really has no credibility, this mother fucker has scammed and hacked pretty much every server who’s been released. Every server we released with him, he pretty much handed out party hats and flat 99s to his friends. He also gave bug stats to his friends for staking. Zorian: Do I need to say much about this kid? He’s the ultimate 10 year old. Jokes around constantly, fucks around constantly and doesn’t think it effects anything. He also hands out free stuff like its candy. Pompano: This motha fucka is probably the only legit 1 of them all, but he has done some shit but it was just to get the server ahead and stay online I suppose. Selling party hats and flat 99s for cash, but it was for the server so i suppose it’s ALL GUD.<br>

The best post I have seen in awhile, for sure.[/quote]</p>
<p>You agree, yet you pay me to design server and client side systems for your website? I don’t think you read the post very clearly.</p>
<p>Also to Dan, our future projects are having more rigid rules regarding the administration. Also, by being able to exploit something means the programmer made a mistake. It’s only a matter of time before they become noticed, and often times I’ve helped people out by diagnosing their website systems. I think you’re attack was a bit misdirected.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I am just out to make a good server. I am not looking for the money. For all i care, the person running the community and anyone else who is helping can keep the sub money. I am open for people helping me but I doubt that is going to happen.</p>
<p>I am able to fund a server without any subscriptions for the first few months and have a dedicated server with 20GB ddos protection which is what is happening. We want to release P2P later on once more content is done and the whole goal is to add as much content as we can.</p>

Can verify all of this, the only time he had given up on it was towards the end of rsca, last two months where he was MIA, but he is fair in regards to running the servers.</p>
<p>Oh and luke did have a fair hand in killing rsca, his shifty business practices and advertisements through our forum werent exactly on the up and up</p>

        <p>The only thing that bothered me with Luke was that he never respected us mods.  We did a lot fir him and yet we never got so much as a simple, “Thanks.”  I understood that I volunteered to do it, but over a year as a mod and I still received absolutely no respect.  It was as though I was a botter.</p>
<p>He treated us like shit so I wasn’t surprised when people took advantage and began abusing.  Not that that gives anyone a reason to abuse, but what did he expect?</p>

        <p>Jojo4, Mod Sarah did abuse. She set stats on numerous accounts of mine for nothing, just simply asked her and she did it. She was moderately retarded. Kryptix bought a booter off Ch3rry and I for 75$ and kept taking down any other server that would come up, RSCE was corrupt as ever and the only reason it is so popular is because it is the only one up. I stopped playing RSCE when Kryptix was alive and just recently joined again after his death, I didn’t trust him nor wanted anything to do with him.</p>

        <p>Not that I knew about that but Sarah explained to me what happened leading up her being de-admined and ip-banned from RSCE and Luke had all of it deleted.  He didn’t want anyone to know what he did and he sacrificed a person who was positive for RSCE.  That’s why I was enthusiastic about RSCD since it would be a fresh start for everyone.</p>
<p>Until Dustin came back I honestly didn’t think of playing RSCE again.  I can’t exactly agree with you when you say RSCE was a corrupt server.  Luke made many sordid decisions, but he was the owner not the server.  Going back to an America reference, I dislike our government and the corruption that is so evident but yet so secret, but I love my country and what it stands for.  In a way that is how RSCE is, for I like the server but disliked how it was run.</p>
<p>P.S.  Has there been any admin that hasn’t set stats for someone?  We’d be hard-pressed to find one.</p>

I never abused, Mod Cell never abused, Rampage, no abuse.  Mod Sarah never abused and what Luke did to her was foul.  There is a reason why all of us lasted so long.</p>
<p>You have any idea how many times I was asked to get ips from ppl?  I had to ban friends and one mod as well.</p>
<p>There were plenty of mods that were true to the game.  The problem is admins often choose mods that they know nothing about and that is why bad things happen.  As a matter of fact, Luke didn’t really know who I was when he made me chat mod.</p>
<p>Also another thing that ruined RSCE mods was taking away the mod system and giving them full mod right off the bat.  Ppl just weren’t ready.<br>

<p>P.S.  Has there been any admin that hasn’t set stats for someone?  We’d be hard-pressed to find one.</p>

<p>Pretty sure KO9 hasn’t set stats for anyone.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Now now, didn’t he have to make himself an account?  :D[/quote]<br>
I set stats on my account and only ever on my account. I also only PK’d on that account like 5 times maximum. Not like I had time to grind to 99 flats and run the server at the same time.</p>
