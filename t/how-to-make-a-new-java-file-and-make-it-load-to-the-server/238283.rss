    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-new-java-file-and-make-it-load-to-the-server/238283</link>
    <description>Like I want to make a new .java file called &quot;globalobjects.java&quot; and for it to load up instead of the &quot;client.java&quot; to load it.
but how can I get it to load in the server and how can I get the &quot;globalobjects.java&quot; started? (sorry if im asking to much...)

But it would mean alot to me if someone could help me.</description>
