    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-webclient/393309</link>
    <description>Ok well im trying to make a webclient. I have the auto cache downloader working fine and I have jarred it but these are the things I need to do that I dunno how-

1. Upload my cache for the auto downloader to download from (www.mywebsite.com/cache?. Dunno how to do that)
2. Same thing as #1 but instead I need a link for the client.jar so I can advertise on rs-ps.org
3. The code for the webclient?
4. Where should I upload it?

Rep++ for anyone who can help me with 2 or more of these things.</description>
