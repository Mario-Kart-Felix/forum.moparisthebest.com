    <title>Help with webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-webclient/426683</link>
    <description>I was trying to convert my client into a webclient, and everything went well. So I jarred my client, and ran the jar, and got this error after the cache downloaded:
[img]http://i739.photobucket.com/albums/xx32/float1234/Capture.jpg[/img]
So, I was eager to find out what could have caused this, so I went back into my webclient folder and ran the .bat file that starts up the client, and I got this error in the CMD prompt: Error: loaderror Starting up 32

Please help! I don&#39;t have any money, so all I can do is rep++.</description>
