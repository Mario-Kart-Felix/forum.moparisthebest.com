&lt;blockquote&gt;The geometry of Fractals brings us a new appreciation for the natural world
and the patterns we observe in it.
Many things previously called chaos are now known to follow subtle subtle fractal laws of behavior. So many things turned out to be fractal that the word &quot;chaos&quot; itself (in operational science) had redefined, or actually for the FIRST time Formally Defined as following inherently unpredictable yet generally deterministic rules based on nonlinear iterative equations. Fractals are unpredictable in specific details yet deterministic when viewed as a total pattern - in many ways this reflects what we observe in the small details &amp; total pattern of life in all it&#39;s physical and mental varieties, too ....


FRACTAL FERN: One very simple way to understand fractals and the meaning of &quot;lteration&quot; is to examine a simple recursive operation that produces a fractal fern thru a &quot;chaos game&#39; of generating random numbers and then placing them on a grid.




After a few dozen repetitions or ITERATIONS the shape we would recognize as a Perfect Fern appears from the abstract world of math. How and Why can this be?

The answer to why is that it Simply IS - and it&#39;s quite surprising too! 
Answering How is that nature always follows the simplest &amp; most efficient path. Fractals are maps of the simplest paths sliding up the scale of Dimensions (from 2-D to 3-D and so on). So maybe it&#39;s simply an artifact of nature&#39;s elegance that we find exact correspondences between these inherently existing mathematical forms and natural patterns, and even living creatures of many types. 

Fractals in nature are ubiquitous - clouds, plants, galaxies, shells and more.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you look at the universe as a sphere, then when you go closer to an galaxy you see more spheres. Solar systems look like spheres for a distance but contain several new sphere or planets. Then you have the moons, and the moon’s moons.</p>

A fractal is an infinitely repeating pattern and is actually commonly found in nature, like many have already said here. As you continue to zoom inwards into the fractal, you’ll see the same pattern over and over again. I think a visual aid will help you understand :rolleyes: :</p>

<blockquote>The strategy is based on its hypothesis that the universe follows a pattern: that it is populated by a hierarchy of similarly-shaped, electrically powered, spirals/loops such as galaxy clusters, galaxies, nebulae, stars, and smaller. Their shared features, all carrying tell-tale information, are on-record and available for interpretation. Initially six were found, promisingly pertinent to atoms:
They are long-lived.
They have angular momentum.
They have torroidal magnetic fields.
They are alternators/oscillators.
They emit electromagnetic energy.
They are flat.
Signs of atomic fractality, including a positive feedback (oscillatory) mechanism, akin to the one found for celestial objects, are already apparent in atomic spectra:
The wide-spectrum emissions of ions, the so-called “fine structure”, are a sure sign of such feedback in an over-driven oscillator, well-known to electronic engineers. The chaotic nature of the radiated frequencies is characteristic of fractals in that it is bifurcated.</blockquote>
<p>You should read over that, it’s pretty interesting.</p>
<p>In a reply to your first paragraph about the quantum theory, I really haven’t went in depth into quantum physics myself. However, I do think that if the fractal is found in the atoms, I do believe it’ll be found in the quarks further inside.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Ruby, post:6, topic:450326”]I’ve always had an interest in fractals, they amaze me. The way they link nature with mathematics is just simply mindblowing.</p>
<p>In Scotland, our education system is absolutely horrid. When I was in high school, I brought fractal geometry into discussion in a physics class, and asked my teacher if it was true that when fractal geometry is applied to a physics state that no matter how far you zoom in on something you never reach a fundamental discrete or quantized level and she had no idea what fractals even were.</p>
<p>I still don’t even know the answer to that question, anyone care to shed some light on it? I’m currently doing a masters degree in physics and I don’t want to be the idiot who brings it up in a lecture or study group and is wrong.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t want to be wrong either, so I’ll try and find a source to back me up. I think in theory you’re right, because fractals recursively generate themselves to infinitely deep levels. I think as far as physical nature is concerned, you would see somewhat of a fractal as you zoom in on, say, an organism. There’s one organism, many tissues, many many cells, and within each cell, are many many many many molecules and within those are many atoms. When you look smaller, you’d see the subatomic particles or more that make up the protons, neutrons, and electrons. Getting any farther than that gets into quantum theory I haven’t learned enough about to comment on.</p>
<p>Ah, and I just found this: <a href="http://www.fractaluniverse.org/v2/?page_id=51" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fractaluniverse.org/v2/?page_id=51</a></p>
<p>So that takes a perspective I haven’t considered. They are analyzing the wave lengths and wave behaviors of particles and comparing it to Shrodinger’s wave equation. They are considering the complexity of nature to be iterative, so within each iteration is a more complex “graph” (if you will) of the particles wave lengths and wave behaviors, casting a sort of fractal system. I just skimmed the article, so I might wrong in this paragraph. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>I’ve always had an interest in fractals, they amaze me. The way they link nature with mathematics is just simply mindblowing.</p>
<p>In Scotland, our education system is absolutely horrid. When I was in high school, I brought fractal geometry into discussion in a physics class, and asked my teacher if it was true that when fractal geometry is applied to a physics state that no matter how far you zoom in on something you never reach a fundamental discrete or quantized level and she had no idea what fractals even were.</p>
<p>I still don’t even know the answer to that question, anyone care to shed some light on it? I’m currently doing a masters degree in physics and I don’t want to be the idiot who brings it up in a lecture or study group and is wrong.</p>

              <p>Fractals are very nice, back in high school we had to do an oral exam in a specific subject, and because I’ve always been intrigued with fractals, the choice for me was quite easy.<br>
The book I read went over simple fractals, like the Koch snowflake, and how they’re constructed.<br>
There was also a section on the Mandelbrot fractal, but back at the time the matter regarding that was way above me, since they talked about a lot of thing i hadn’t learned yet.</p>
<p>[quote=“Taharok, post:2, topic:450326”]Fractals are immensely interesting. They play a huge aspect in mathematics and, like the article said, nature. It’s slightly related, but the fibonacci sequence can also be found all around nature and sometimes in the form of a fractal! Here are some pictures:</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but that’s just really interesting to me lol. Fractals are also useful cryptography and encryption, along with so many other fields of science. I’ve been neglecting replying because there’s really so much to talk about with fractals it’s a bit overwhelming.[/quote]<br>

This is a pretty cool video for anyone interested in the relation between Fibonacci and nature!</p>
<p>Also, according to a lecturer I had last year, the breeding of rabbits in pairs can be considered as a Fibonacci sequence as well, assuming the conditions are ideal.</p>

              <p>I’ve always found fractals simple, yet complex at once. Such a simple shape or formula can create an absolutely amazing image, and adding more formulas just adds to it. Fractals are some of the most amazing pieces of art and mathematics I’ve ever seen, and that more people should know about them. They really are amazing, and I wish people appreciated the fact that they are art.</p>
<p>And like Taharok said, fractals are found in nature too. Fractals truly are everywhere and most people don’t even realize it.</p>

<blockquote>The geometry of Fractals brings us a new appreciation for the natural world
and the patterns we observe in it.
Many things previously called chaos are now known to follow subtle subtle fractal laws of behavior. So many things turned out to be fractal that the word "chaos" itself (in operational science) had redefined, or actually for the FIRST time Formally Defined as following inherently unpredictable yet generally deterministic rules based on nonlinear iterative equations. Fractals are unpredictable in specific details yet deterministic when viewed as a total pattern - in many ways this reflects what we observe in the small details &amp; total pattern of life in all it's physical and mental varieties, too ....
<p>FRACTAL FERN: One very simple way to understand fractals and the meaning of “lteration” is to examine a simple recursive operation that produces a fractal fern thru a "chaos game’ of generating random numbers and then placing them on a grid.</p>
<p>After a few dozen repetitions or ITERATIONS the shape we would recognize as a Perfect Fern appears from the abstract world of math. How and Why can this be?</p>
<p>The answer to why is that it Simply IS - and it’s quite surprising too!<br>
Answering How is that nature always follows the simplest &amp; most efficient path. Fractals are maps of the simplest paths sliding up the scale of Dimensions (from 2-D to 3-D and so on). So maybe it’s simply an artifact of nature’s elegance that we find exact correspondences between these inherently existing mathematical forms and natural patterns, and even living creatures of many types.</p>
<p>Fractals in nature are ubiquitous - clouds, plants, galaxies, shells and more.</p>
