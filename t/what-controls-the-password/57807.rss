    <title>What controls the password?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-controls-the-password/57807</link>
    <description>Ok, when you go to the character folder and then click on the character for a pimpscape source, it comes up with a bunch of numbers for the password. How do i make it so that their password comes up because i have people that want me to tell them their password on a daily basis and i cant give it to them because its a bunch of numbers.

Please help me out lol</description>
