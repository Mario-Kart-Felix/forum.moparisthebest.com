I have re-continued the project because I have a lot more time to work, this project will be finished. :)

Before continuing through the thread I would like to remind you that this is [u]NOT[/u] a Runescape remake.

The server is currently getting ready to Go through Beta. I will open Beta once I feel the server has enough content to be enjoyable.
In a reply tell me if you want to take part in Beta.

I will not be working on this that often, I just don&#39;t have time for it right now.
