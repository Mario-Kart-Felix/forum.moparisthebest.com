    <description> i downloaded the server program cheezescape_80. inside this .rar folder i found the compile.bat and the runserver.bat icons. when i open them it doesn&#39;t let me edit them, and i can&#39;t click edit on the outside, I have an extract to... option. i tried that and it let me edit it in a different folder(i created a new folder on the desktop) so it was edited on the desktop version but it isn&#39;t in the .rar folder and i can&#39;t edit that 1. someone please help me.

P.S. once i get this server up and running i am going to need someone who is good at programming to help me with a few programs. thanx a ton! jeff</description>
