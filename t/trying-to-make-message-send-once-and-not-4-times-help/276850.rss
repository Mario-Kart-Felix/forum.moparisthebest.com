    <title>Trying to make message send once and not 4 times. HELP!</title>

    <description>I know the title kind of seems sad, like I don&#39;t know how to make a message that is sent to you only send once and not 4 times, but this is harder than it seems. This is what it&#39;s doing when I try and click on the dark bow:

Now, I search for that message in my client class and I find this code:

[code]            if (playerLevel[playerRanged] - CLRanged &lt; 0) {
                sendMessage(
                        &quot;You need &quot; + CLRanged + &quot; &quot; + statName[playerRanged]
                        + &quot; to equip this item.&quot;);
                GoFalse = true;
            }[/code]

It only says it once there... I use an allstarscape source by the way. I&#39;ve also tried searching to see if maybe this code was in my client class in 4 different places but it&#39;s not. The dark bow id is 15156 and here is the code for needing level 80 to wield it:

[code]    public int GetCLRanged(int ItemID) {
        if (ItemID == 15156) {
            return 80;
        }
}[/code]

Why is it sending 4 messages and not one?</description>
