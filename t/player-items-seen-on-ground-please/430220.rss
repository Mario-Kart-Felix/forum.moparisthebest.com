    <title>Player items seen on ground.... please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-items-seen-on-ground-please/430220</link>
    <description>firstly, items didnt drop when you died but i solved that, now when the user dies you cannot see the items if you kill the player, only the player that died can, and also when you drop items they don&#39;t appear on the ground only fire cape and barrows gloves appear to the other player everything else is on the ground but you cant see. Been trying to solve this for a few days now, help please?..... also dropping an item just makes the item disappear but monster drops do appear

Edit: PI source - the mythscape v2 version (removed the fun pk area as thats where the items being dropped problem was)</description>
