[b][size=18pt]General[/size][/b]

Minecraft is a game of creativity and survival. The basic point of Minecraft is to build a basic shelter on your first night because when night rolls in, zombies and other mobs will spawn, and chase after you to kill you. Arrow keys to move and space bar to jump obviously. Left click to attack and punch.

[i]P1: Collecting resources[/i]
Resources is the basis of minecraft. In order to obtain them, you must &quot;punch&quot; them. To do this, walk around until you find a tree. Get close enough  for a small, grey box appear over the resource, and [b]left[/b] click it and [b]hold[/b] it in until it breaks. Pick up the tiny circling square. The wood should now be in your inventory.
 
[i]P2: Crafting[/i]

Crafting is the art of making stuff. Refering to P1, press the letter &quot;I&quot; on your keyboard. The summary of your character and a small 2x2 box should appear next to your char. Drag your wood into the square, and 4 Wooden Planks should appear. Click on the wooden planks, hence how the other wood disapears, you just crafted your wood into wooden planks, preferably used for the structure of your shelter/house. Now, creating a crafting bench. put all of the wooden planks into all of the squares in your crafting workshop. A Crafting Bench should appear, click it and drag it onto your inventory and place it on the ground. This will provide more crafting space, and the ability to craft anything in the world.

[i]P3: Tools and Weaponry[/i]

In order to sculpt your shelter, you need [i]tools[/i]. Tools are shovels, pickaxes, hoes, and axes. Shovels eat up dirt relatively fast, depending on your type of shovel and we&#39;ll get to that soon. Pickaxes mines stone at a faster rate than punching it, hoes are used for creating soil to grow crops, and axes chop up wood at a faster pace. In order to make these, you need sticks. Repeat P1 until you have about 6 wood. Craft them into wooden planks. Refering to P3, click on your crafting bench  and put 3 of each wood on top and on bottom of eachother (if you don&#39;t get it, refer to the link above from the minecraft wiki) to create sticks. Then, put the 2 sticks on top and on bottom of eachother and 3 wood on the top 3 squares, and bam you have a pickaxe. (yes I know that was confusing, I think its better just to click on the minecraft wiki link above  :o)

[i]P4: Mining[/i]
Sooner or later you should come across an indent in a hill with grey blocks, this is a basic entrance to a mine. Mines hold valuable jewels, depening on how far you dig, you can reach gold, diamonds, redstone and more. 
Anyway, enter the mine. Left click on a grey box and hold it. Then it will break, dropping Cobblestone. Cobblestone is not flammable. Cobblestone has no really uses other than creating better equipment, refer to P3.

[i]P5: Griefing[/i]
Griefing is basically destroying other people work, flooding houses, setting forests on fire, setting houses on fire, and others. This is strongly against the moparscape minecraft server and 99.9% of other servers too, don&#39;t do this.

[i]P6: Mobs[/i]
Mobs are monsters or creatures in the game. There are some safe mobs, such as cows, pigs, chickens and sheep. Those mobs will not hurt you and they are visible day and night. Dangerous mobs come out ONLY at night and they consist of: Zombies, Skeletons, Creepers and Spiders. Creepers explode if attacked or disturbed, its very infamous for ruining shelters and houses. Zombies hit high but they walk very slow, Spiders hit very low but move very fast, skeletons move slow but have a bowanarrow.

<p>Minecraft is a game of creativity and survival. The basic point of Minecraft is to build a basic shelter on your first night because when night rolls in, zombies and other mobs will spawn, and chase after you to kill you. Arrow keys to move and space bar to jump obviously. Left click to attack and punch.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">P1: Collecting resources</span><br>
Resources is the basis of minecraft. In order to obtain them, you must “punch” them. To do this, walk around until you find a tree. Get close enough  for a small, grey box appear over the resource, and <span class="bbcode-b">left</span> click it and <span class="bbcode-b">hold</span> it in until it breaks. Pick up the tiny circling square. The wood should now be in your inventory.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">P2: Crafting</span></p>
<p>Crafting is the art of making stuff. Refering to P1, press the letter “I” on your keyboard. The summary of your character and a small 2x2 box should appear next to your char. Drag your wood into the square, and 4 Wooden Planks should appear. Click on the wooden planks, hence how the other wood disapears, you just crafted your wood into wooden planks, preferably used for the structure of your shelter/house. Now, creating a crafting bench. put all of the wooden planks into all of the squares in your crafting workshop. A Crafting Bench should appear, click it and drag it onto your inventory and place it on the ground. This will provide more crafting space, and the ability to craft anything in the world.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">P3: Tools and Weaponry</span></p>
<p>In order to sculpt your shelter, you need <span class="bbcode-i">tools</span>. Tools are shovels, pickaxes, hoes, and axes. Shovels eat up dirt relatively fast, depending on your type of shovel and we’ll get to that soon. Pickaxes mines stone at a faster rate than punching it, hoes are used for creating soil to grow crops, and axes chop up wood at a faster pace. In order to make these, you need sticks. Repeat P1 until you have about 6 wood. Craft them into wooden planks. Refering to P3, click on your crafting bench  and put 3 of each wood on top and on bottom of eachother (if you don’t get it, refer to the link above from the minecraft wiki) to create sticks. Then, put the 2 sticks on top and on bottom of eachother and 3 wood on the top 3 squares, and bam you have a pickaxe. (yes I know that was confusing, I think its better just to click on the minecraft wiki link above  :o)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">P4: Mining</span><br>
Sooner or later you should come across an indent in a hill with grey blocks, this is a basic entrance to a mine. Mines hold valuable jewels, depening on how far you dig, you can reach gold, diamonds, redstone and more.<br>
Anyway, enter the mine. Left click on a grey box and hold it. Then it will break, dropping Cobblestone. Cobblestone is not flammable. Cobblestone has no really uses other than creating better equipment, refer to P3.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">P5: Griefing</span><br>
Griefing is basically destroying other people work, flooding houses, setting forests on fire, setting houses on fire, and others. This is strongly against the moparscape minecraft server and 99.9% of other servers too, don’t do this.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">P6: Mobs</span><br>
Mobs are monsters or creatures in the game. There are some safe mobs, such as cows, pigs, chickens and sheep. Those mobs will not hurt you and they are visible day and night. Dangerous mobs come out ONLY at night and they consist of: Zombies, Skeletons, Creepers and Spiders. Creepers explode if attacked or disturbed, its very infamous for ruining shelters and houses. Zombies hit high but they walk very slow, Spiders hit very low but move very fast, skeletons move slow but have a bowanarrow.</p>
