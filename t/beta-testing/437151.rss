    <description>Hey guys. 
I haven&#39;t been active in a while but I&#39;ve come back working on a Runescape Private Server related project. I just have a few enquiries!

Firstly, if I wish to recruit a group of people to do beta testing on my project until I am happy with the product and happy to put online, would I be able to recruit on the Moparscape forums somehow? I know there is a Development Team section, however I&#39;m not too sure if that applies to what I&#39;m looking for.

Secondly, I wish to make it a sponsered server when it is ready. This question is more to Mopar himself. I would like it to be sponsered the moment it is ready, however I am aware of the bidding process and I know that it may take time, especially considering I am not aware of the current bids. I was looking for an amount I could bid, which would just get me within the sponsered server bracket. I am willing to pay, I just wish to know the current bids if possible.

Thanks for reading guys. Greatly appreciated.</description>

              <p>You can however post a link to your website (if you have one). Having a link on your topic to a downloadable or playable web client that can connect to your beta server is not allowed however.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that on your website you can’t have a link to the client so people can play, etc.</p>
