Fight Caves
Fight caves will be just like runescape, only shorter. Don&#39;t you think it is just ridiculous having to spend so much time having to just sit down and do that minigames in order just to receive one cape? That is why the Fight cave waves have been shortened to a number of 21 instead. We have also made a miniIcon to show what wave you are on! Also, because the waves have been shortened, the tokkul amount will be less in effect, minimising it down to 2678

Fight Pits
One of the most famous PvP minigames has been perfected in 317 Reborn. Opponents in the pits waiting room will be added to as fighters once the timer has finished, and there people will fight. Like runescape, every fighter in the fight&#39;s combat level will be added to the amount of tokkul the winner will get at the end. No one can cheat and get free tokkul like in delta servers. You will need 2 or more people in order for the timer to start.

Mage Arena
One of the most risky minigames has now been fully added to 317 Reborn. This minigame will unlock the ability to receive one of 3 god staffs + capes and unlock the 3 god spells. After defeating Kolodion and the forms of him, and after receiving your staff, you must go into the mage arena and use the spell 100 times in order to reuse that spell in the outside of the mage arena.

More explanations will come soon!
