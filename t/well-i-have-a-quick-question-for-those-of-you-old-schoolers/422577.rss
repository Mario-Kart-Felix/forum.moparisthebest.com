    <title>Well, I have a quick question for those of you old schoolers</title>

    <description>Okay, so, just a quick question for all&#39;a ya... For RSPS&#39;s that are a revision 194, what date/time period is that from if you&#39;re looking at JaGeX&#39;s Runescape? Like, is it 2006 or before it? &#39;Cause a lot of people have 317&#39;s that they say are &quot;2006 remakes&quot; (Which there are just sooo damn many people attempting that. Come on, guys, actually finish your work lol) but 194 is a bit before that. Is it 2005-2006, or still the year of 2006?

ALSO! Sorry if this isn&#39;t the correct section for this sort of a question, I wasn&#39;t able to find a more appropriate category.</description>

              <p>no, 194 is around 2003 I believe. Those were the times. I remember playing rs2 beta. I was so excited. It was amazing compared to rsc. I also remember when they added the chat filter. Good times. (look it up to see what I mean.)</p>
