    <title>Steeping in a certain place does something help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/steeping-in-a-certain-place-does-something-help/438484</link>
    <description>I am  working through the Underground Pass, setting it up for its quest, and I came across something I have not yet done before.
In the first cave, there is a mesh on the floor. I know from RS Wiki that stepping on the wrong place sends you to a pit. I was thinking of just having it tele you back to the beginning of the mesh and do some damage. 

What I have not yet dealt with is how to make something happen by stepping &quot;here&quot;. There are no objects or such to interact with to make it happen. Could anyone point me in the right direction here?

This is the place I am working on.

              <p>Ok feel stupid now lmfao…thanks a million! Will test out asap. Got hit on another issue of my globaldrops not actually showing up…working on finding the missing “something” making them not appear atm. Repp for the help though!</p>
<p>EDIT: It is a complete success! Outside of rep, and adding credits into the code, I cannot think of any other way to thank you guys! Many many thanks! Maybe I can have the person in this room say it was created by you guys lol!</p>
<p>Success in making you pop back to the beginning:<br>

<p>Heh get myself all set up with my little grid before posting, and the post you made has made a jump ahead in it…then I got stopped. I am actually not 100% certain where this coding would actually go. I almost feel like this would not be in client.java, but elsewhere. Am I correct or wrong on that one?</p>
