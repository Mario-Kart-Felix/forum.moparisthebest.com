There are couple of RSC servers, mostly high rate servers and well… They tend to differ from real RSC too much, at least for my taste and I believe they do for some others as well.</p>
<p>I used to play in Project RSC until this morning, which seems to be dead now. However, it was enough to raise my interest to RSC after 11-12 years of break and now I’m willing to form team that strives to achieve RSC once again.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Everyone who still loves RSC and those who are capable of coding it, hear me out:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>I’m willing to fund the server until donations are able to pick it up = Dedicated server etc, possibly small bonuses to coders from my pouch</li>
<li>Also I will recruit the team and handle the responsibility</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What I need from you is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge of RSC Emulation</li>
<li>Knowledge of Website/Forums</li>
<li>Knowledge of RSC</li>
<li>Love to RSC and dedication</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Goal:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Strongly loyal to RSC</li>
<li>No profit server which offers P2P and F2P areas for free</li>
<li>You may donate for several things that enhance your gameplay, however nothing that puts tremendous advantage over those who doesn’t donate</li>
<li>1-2.5x rates with the possibility of having double/triple exp weekends from time to time (depending on rate)</li>
<li>Better voting system then what current servers offer</li>
<li>To complete all RSC Quests and P2P</li>
<li>Team that can be trusted and also which listens to what players has to say</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if you still feel interested feel free to post your opinions here or pm me and lets see what we can do together. I’m open to new all ideas, what I posted here is “my” idea and I don’t even think it covers everything. Regardless of who decides to implement this, I will be your support/you will be mine or so I wish <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">More info:</span></p>
<p>I will host it properly on a dedicated server. But, for starters I wish to find 2-4 devs that are familiar with RSC/RS Emulation, after that we’ll compare current emulators and choose the best that fits us, then start developing it further and aim for replication of RSC. We’ll set clear goals/TODO list for the emulator we choose, and proceed in priority order. However, I need knowledge of from you guys who know emulators better then me.</p>
<p>After we have decided which Emu we choose, we’ll need simple but professional looking site with registering page and forums. (Of course some unique features will be added such as: Highscores, calculators, creature/item databases and so forth). And here I need people who knows html/php/sql and so forth. Ps. Got 1 person who wishes to help on this.</p>
<p>I’ll be your host,  community manager, staff manager and all other various jobs + <span class="bbcode-b">I’m willing to pay some gratifications for developing.</span></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/xrune.html">@xrune</a>, I agree on some parts like sprites that could enhance the gameplay as long as they don’t look too much out of RSC, if they blend in perfectly I don’t see no reason why. I saw someone talking about RSC with RS2 interface, that was nice idea in my opinion. Any visual stuff that doesn’t harm the game could be considered. Personally, I’d manage without these visual enhancements but we’d need to discuss this more =)</p>

        <p>This is going to turn out like Project RSC did recently. I stuck around with PRSC until it started delving from the replica idea and now it’s turned into garbage. It seems like a lot of people want to make a “replica” or a server “strongly loyal” to RSC but it never works out in this community.</p>
<blockquote>* Team which listens to what players has to say</blockquote>
<blockquote>* Strongly loyal to RSC</blockquote>
<p>Those basically cancel out. You can’t please anybody because they don’t know what they want and your server turns out to be like all the others. Seems like this is already headed for failure with new sprite updates among other things.</p>
<blockquote>Rsc is becoming more like rs2 everyday, but we need the players from rs2 to play rsc, they may already know things from rs2 that will help them play rsc,... I think players like the feel and gameplay of runescape classic better than rs2... its the combat system they come to love and the pking...
<p>I think if were going to make this work we need(some of the things project rsc started to do):</p>
<p>*New sprites<br>
*new items (some with bonuses)<br>
*new objects<br>
*new wall objects<br>
*new models<br>
*New quests<br>
*new skills</p>
</blockquote>Why would players from RS2 even bother with a half-assed-looking fake RS2? The combat system? Unlikely. RS2 players like and play RS2 for a reason.
<blockquote>RSC is really dying even though there is still a lot of people who are interested in it.</blockquote>If there were a lot of people interested in it, it wouldn't be dying.
<blockquote>There are couple of RSC servers, mostly high rate servers and well.. They tend to differ from real RSC too much, at least for my taste and I believe they do for some others as well.</blockquote>PRSC wasn't "high rate" and was originally aimed at a replica server. It differs a lot less, even now, than what you're already saying you're OK with for this server.

        <p>[quote=“Rodgerwilco, post:6, topic:513599”]Any server today can pull in 150 online. The community still has interest but nobody wants to deal with the repetitive shit server owners put out. RSC needs to be remade. It needs an adventure.[/quote]150 online is not a lot and that’s probably the highest it would hit (around 80 unique at best).</p>
<p>Anyway, if you’re looking to start a low-rate server right after PRSC bites the dust, your player count’s going to be a lot lower than PRSC’s was when it started. Players aren’t going to expect any others to last.</p>

        <p>Honestly you can keep the feel of RSC while adding new content. Not portals and tacky additions. Adding better sprites to amulets, etc., does not take away from the “feel” of RSC. All it does is make the game a little more appealing. RSC is about grinding to actually get something. Not having it handed to you. If you actually add content to the game without raising xp, then people will be interesting anyways if it’s done right, because it’s something new that they haven’t done before. Ex. If you added new quests, or new resources to produce from skilling(at all levels), expanded the higher level game with new content, then people will have something to work for. Just because one server fails doesn’t mean the idea wouldn’t work anyway. I’m not for a 100% replica, but I personally think PRSC would have kept going if it had been run properly and the administration had even remotely cared about making the server better(previous staff).</p>

<p>I agree with tiger… also it has to do with making the right decisions for when things should be released… like for example rsce came out with runecrafting too soon, they never released the runemysteries quest to use the runes, and the areas they put the rune alters are not the correct areas… also having portals everywhere kinda ruins the game…  everything matters when it comes to making the game…</p>
<p>Maybe have a development client open so players can help you test out new content before its released… and get their feedback from it… as your making it…</p>

Even if you did add a few new sprites, you can’t possible expect that to attract any new players. It doesn’t make the game more appealing and even if it did, it wouldn’t magically produce more players. I’m sorry but this server’s destined to fail and you’re wasting your time.</p>

</blockquote>Nobody cares about the quests involved or where the altars were located. Rune mysterious (up until 2012) was just a fetch quest that took 3 minutes to complete. Runecrafting failed in RSCE because it wasn’t profitable for skillers to do.

        <p>^I love rcing quest and the altars in the correct location. Rcing should always be a difficult skill. Skillers don’t make cash because pkers cry and bitch “no runes”.</p>
<p>Nobody actually remembers that mage pking was for the rich.  If you had a mage pure you put a shit ton of effort and cash into it. It sucks how private servers have changed the way people remember the game.</p>

        <p>Very nice to hear different opinions here, its worth to read instead of just raging. Everyone views RSC slightly in their own way.</p>
<p>But, I also believe that compromises must be made if we are to unite people with different beliefs about RSC. For example: Necklace or armor with new sprite, how is it gonna ruin anyones game? Unlikely to happen, its more likely that something else bothers the player already like low population, unable to pk, unable to buy/sell something or broken content. I think that there might be a little bit of preconception because of other stuff “failing”. If we were to add some new sprites and possibly new client look (at least bigger client is something I wish for) it wouldn’t be such a big thing in the end. I’ve done customizing in WoW Private servers that blend in to the World of Warcraft perfectly, quests, items and so forth. I was even rewarded for being Blizzard like. Don’t get me wrong because, currently I’d just like to focus on completing RSC because there is a lot to do as far as I know.</p>
<p>@ RSCShadow, I know that some may feel it hard to start again in low-rate after losing their chars, but its not something I or this server can heal, its always a risk to join private server.</p>
