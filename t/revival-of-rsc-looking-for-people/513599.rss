    <title>Revival of RSC, Looking for people</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/revival-of-rsc-looking-for-people/513599</link>
    <description>[size=12pt][b]Hello! [/b]

The reason why I started this thread is because I feel like RSC is really dying even though there is still a lot of people who are interested in it. There are couple of RSC servers, mostly high rate servers and well.. They tend to differ from real RSC too much, at least for my taste and I believe they do for some others as well.

I used to play in Project RSC until this morning, which seems to be dead now. However, it was enough to raise my interest to RSC after 11-12 years of break and now I&#39;m willing to form team that strives to achieve RSC once again.

[b]Everyone who still loves RSC and those who are capable of coding it, hear me out:[/b]

* I&#39;m willing to fund the server until donations are able to pick it up = Dedicated server etc, possibly small bonuses to coders from my pouch
* Also I will recruit the team and handle the responsibility

[b]What I need from you is:[/b]

* Knowledge of RSC Emulation
* Knowledge of Website/Forums
* Knowledge of RSC
* Love to RSC and dedication

[b]Goal:[/b]

* Strongly loyal to RSC
* No profit server which offers P2P and F2P areas for free
* You may donate for several things that enhance your gameplay, however nothing that puts tremendous advantage over those who doesn&#39;t donate
* 1-2.5x rates with the possibility of having double/triple exp weekends from time to time (depending on rate)
* Better voting system then what current servers offer
* To complete all RSC Quests and P2P
* Team that can be trusted and also which listens to what players has to say

Now, if you still feel interested feel free to post your opinions here or pm me and lets see what we can do together. I&#39;m open to new all ideas, what I posted here is &quot;my&quot; idea and I don&#39;t even think it covers everything. Regardless of who decides to implement this, I will be your support/you will be mine or so I wish :)

<p>I’d say that subscription services (where everyone has to pay, not just people who want some benefit) are superior because then people get what they pay for.<br>
If they pay their $5 - $7 for the month and they can login and play during that month then they’ve gotten the agreed value for their money. If such a server goes belly up then, at most, someone would stand to lose any remaining subscription time. And if payments are taken on a month-to-month basis then that loss is capped at $5 - $7, worst case (i.e., the server goes down one day into a newly paid month).</p>
<p>With 200 subscribers each paying $7, you wind up with $1400 per month. That level of income, in my opinion, would cover hosting (which is quite exorbitant in cost) and administrating the server but not a lot in the way of content updates.<br>
Mind you, I’ve never understood the insatiable demand that this community (which is supposed to be a retro gaming community, of sorts) has for fresh content. love off to newer games if you want that.<br>
[/quote]The problem is that nobody (maybe a few, but it’s doubtful) will pay that just to play.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t know prices elsewhere, but on a night out in Australia you can spend that on a single drink in the right clubs. In fact, the single drink is probably more expensive in some of them.</p>
<p>If people don’t want it enough to pay then they don’t want it. Everybody here now is surely in their twenties, or at the very least eighteen. If you’re an adult and you think someone should provide everything for free (which is what it comes down to when your income is donation-based) so that you can enjoy yourself and have the occasional whinge about them not providing enough for free then you’ve got some growing up to do.[/quote]While I completely agree, rational thinking isn’t something that is done by the majority of people, especially in this community…</p>

I’d say that subscription services (where everyone has to pay, not just people who want some benefit) are superior because then people get what they pay for.<br>
If they pay their $5 - $7 for the month and they can login and play during that month then they’ve gotten the agreed value for their money. If such a server goes belly up then, at most, someone would stand to lose any remaining subscription time. And if payments are taken on a month-to-month basis then that loss is capped at $5 - $7, worst case (i.e., the server goes down one day into a newly paid month).</p>
<p>With 200 subscribers each paying $7, you wind up with $1400 per month. That level of income, in my opinion, would cover hosting (which is quite exorbitant in cost) and administrating the server but not a lot in the way of content updates.<br>
Mind you, I’ve never understood the insatiable demand that this community (which is supposed to be a retro gaming community, of sorts) has for fresh content. love off to newer games if you want that.<br>

I don’t know prices elsewhere, but on a night out in Australia you can spend that on a single drink in the right clubs. In fact, the single drink is probably more expensive in some of them.</p>
<p>If people don’t want it enough to pay then they don’t want it. Everybody here now is surely in their twenties, or at the very least eighteen. If you’re an adult and you think someone should provide everything for free (which is what it comes down to when your income is donation-based) so that you can enjoy yourself and have the occasional whinge about them not providing enough for free then you’ve got some growing up to do.</p>

<p>OT: I am working on my own base (still), which uses mudclient 140. I’m working on the core features still (namely updating entities and multiplayer support right now). Once that is completed (if ever), I plan on creating fresh content. We’ll see how it goes though, I think it will be fun.</p>

              <p>The problem with being a for-profit in this community, is that people don’t like that, because of what happens every single time…</p>
<p>There are really two scenarios, though there are some variations, but these are the primary ways it happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The owner starts off really actives and starts up a “donation” system, which typically claims all the money will go towards the server. After that, the owner becomes less active and people get mad. Meanwhile, the owner is using the donation money for things other than the server (buying video games, nudes, etc.). Then, once people realize the owner is less active, they start saying the server is dying, which causes people to quit and the owner to become less active. Eventually this kills the server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The owner starts off really actives and starts up a “donation” system. Once the owner gets a certain amount of money, the server is shut down and the owner runs with the money.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, people are tired of being scammed/lied to and are much more hesitant to join a server that involves money. Although, to this day, nobody has even tried to be transparent, so I’m not quite sure how it would work out.</p>

              <p>I agree with enfyre. Running for-profit is obviously required to maintain the viability of the server.<br>
It has the added advantage of making botting less attractive too, because getting caught has a dollar value attached. You stand to lose all that you’ve paid in subscription fees up until that point.<br>
I especially agree with the remark about transparency.</p>
<p>There is a point where operation effort goes beyond what could reasonably be expected of someone for free.<br>
I think if the remuneration for this was outlined in a transparent manner, people would be less adverse to the idea.</p>
<p>To anybody who thinks the main operator/s shouldn’t be paid at all, two words: Kill yourself.<br>
You wouldn’t work a job for free, so why should somebody administrate an RSC server for free? I saw the amount of whinging that the PRSC staff had to put up with; even somebody on the payroll doesn’t deserve that.</p>

              <p>Don’t know why people still think low exp servers are the way to go. Look at prsc, was successful for the first couple months until people started getting to the 60s and 70s stats, got discouraged and walked away. RSCE is successful at up to 32x exp, although its arguable that thats too high, in the same way that 1x or 2x is too low. I wonder why no one develops a server with mid exp rates that have broad appeal to the masses.<br>
Also, what is it with servers trying to be non-profit? Make a friggin profit and pay for the hosting, pay for months of hosting, make it all transparent. Why would anyone want to play a server that runs on a shoe string budget and could go down at any time with no warning!? Again, look at prsc. We want a financially STABLE server- Sub-cards are the key, look at rsce- still alive and kicking after almost 4 years, why? Because its profitable. Its just a shame that its such high exp rate.<br>
My 2 cents.</p>
