    <description>I have updated the cache, and tested everything on my local one. Then i tried with more than one account logged on it all goes wrong.


When a second account logs in, rather from a different computer or same one, it dc&#39;s both of them and leaves the originall one on. I have googled like crazy i have used the search button like crazy, i have gone through alot of the client and server files and cant find a single reason why this is happening!


I need help on it, ive pmed people, they dont respond. I cant find a packet that could be throwing this off.</description>
