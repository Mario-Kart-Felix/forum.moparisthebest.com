    <title>718/753 error, HELP PLS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-753-error-help-pls/539809</link>
    <description>hello,
i&#39;m trying to play on a 718/753 server with some friends but i got this weird error. i portforwarded, used canyouseeme.org to check if i did it correctly, but when my friends try to connect they get:
[code]error_game_js5_connect[/code]

i know this means it doesn&#39;t connect but i dont know [b]why[/b] it doesn&#39;t connect because everything seems perfectly fine, the port, sub_revision and ip, etc are like they are supposed to be. still they can&#39;t connect and the weirdest thing is that i can, also my firewall is off so that isn&#39;t blocking the ingoing/outgoing connection. someone got an idea what it could be?

btw, i&#39;m using a foxtrot 718 client and a rune evo v2 source with rune evo v3 cache, everything works perfectly fine for me but not for my friends.</description>

              <p>ok, i am sure the problem isn’t in the client or source, my friend tried to host it and it runs perfectly fine now, but i am still wondering what it could be tho. it isn’t the source/client, i am sure i portforwarded correctly, so that isn’t the problem, firewall is off so that can’t block it. but even on hamachi, which always works, it doesn’t load. now, i heard some stuff about windows 8 problems, which i use, but idk what causes the connection error and if there’s a fix for this (idek if this really causes the problem cus i don’t think windows 8 would cause this problem). can someone explain to me what it could be and how i could fix this?</p>
