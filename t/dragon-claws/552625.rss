    <description>Hello,

So i&#39;m using the re-sizeable galkon&#39;s clients, and i have a problem with dragon claws emote and animation, which shows a a dragon breath animation and without any emote
I&#39;ve tried a couple of things like using another client with the same source and it worked fine with another client (using the same source)

So it seems there&#39;s a problem with the first client, with dragon claws animations/emotes not sure thought

Anyone can help me with this?

Thanks very much.</description>
