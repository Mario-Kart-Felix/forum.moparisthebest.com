H1 your an asshole. Why must you insist on insulting people who recolor, then the people who actually attempt to model get insulted just as much. What the hell is it that makes you happy? Its a great first attempt so leave the poor kid alone.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I still told him it was a goodjob are you blind? XD I said I’m sorry but thats honest, do you want me to lie?[/quote]</p>
<p>honest opinion or not, you can still tell him what YOU think he can improve on it, thats called constructive criticism, telling him its a piece of crap doesnt help him at all to improve his view on modeling and what he can do to improve in the future. GIVE HIM TIPS OF IMPROVEMENT.</p>
<p>as for the flame war before my post and after it, shut the fuck up and take it to PM.</p>
<p>OT: i like the sword, but it seems a bit small, it would do better as somewhat of a dagger. Thicken it up a bit and the blade should have only been 1 segment, if you know what i mean. Good job though.</p>

honestly, i have to agree with krackkid, you put that as your sig? and yet you troll, from a few observations, ive only seen you not flame or troll reyx7, rixx or dylan’s models, anyone else’s is officially crap in your view, you dont even give starters a chance, if it doesnt have your stamp of approval, its crap.shit.worthless. just like you flamed iatachi like 50 times on his post, dont like it?stop posting? this is a first model…</p>
<blockquote>WTF for a peice of crap like that? I'm sorry dude but it really doesn't need that many polygons XD but I guess it's okay..</blockquote>
sorry reyx, i know we have been getting out of hand, but honestly, i have just been holding this in so long from just looking through these forums, and i had to say it
thats not critisising at all! "i guess its okay...." doesnt make up for "WTF for a peice of crap like that? I'm sorry dude but it really doesn't need that many polygons"
you learn from your mistakes, but apparently sk1ller, you have not learned that and you dont let anyone else learn from their first mistakes, first time has to be a godlike professional model or gtfo....
on topic, i like the hilt, i like the concept and color!
try making the hand guard smoother and more curved, its too... uhh.... it looks too unrealistic, but ill give you props for the hilt

<p>im guessing you are blind too?<br>
read this, this is a C&amp;P from your previous post “WTF for a peice of crap like that?”<br>
well?<br>
you couldof posted some constructive critisisim, but NO. you just had to flame.<br>
your posts dont seem to be helping anyone (in a good way) imagine if you releaced a new sword, and then i came along and went (without taking much notice of what you actually made)<br>
“OMG IT SUCKS, GTFO, i dont like ur style of modeling, i can do much better because im H1 SK1LLER.”<br>
yeah, thats just not cool.</p>
<p>ANYWAY.<br>
ontopic: well looking at your wireframe (im hoping your reading this H1) you could entirely get rid of the bottom orb and replace it with 2 spheres inside eachother, and deleate sections of the outer sphere, so that it shows sections of the inside sphere,  giving the same effect as what you have done now.<br>
over all, the blade is good, its low poly and has no funky faces (well, from the pictures you have provided)<br>
but yeah, the bottom part of the hilt would never be seen in its fullest, so i would recomend making it either:<br>
A: bigger<br>
B: doing what i said for you to do above (with the 2 spheres)<br>
c: just make it 1 glowing sphere</p>

<p>I’m not that self centered and my faggotness level isn’t that high, like that word? Faggotness, anyway, I could help him but I said it as my honest opinion of what I thought, as I said before, and I’ll say it again, do you want me to lie? If not then just let me be honest, all critics are honest…</p>

read this, this is a C&amp;P from your previous post “WTF for a peice of crap like that?”<br>
well?<br>
you couldof posted some constructive critisisim, but NO. you just had to flame.<br>
your posts dont seem to be helping anyone (in a good way) imagine if you releaced a new sword, and then i came along and went (without taking much notice of what you actually made)<br>
“OMG IT SUCKS, GTFO, i dont like ur style of modeling, i can do much better because im H1 SK1LLER.”<br>
yeah, thats just not cool.</p>
<p>ANYWAY.<br>
ontopic: well looking at your wireframe (im hoping your reading this H1) you could entirely get rid of the bottom orb and replace it with 2 spheres inside eachother, and deleate sections of the outer sphere, so that it shows sections of the inside sphere,  giving the same effect as what you have done now.<br>
over all, the blade is good, its low poly and has no funky faces (well, from the pictures you have provided)<br>
but yeah, the bottom part of the hilt would never be seen in its fullest, so i would recomend making it either:<br>
A: bigger<br>
B: doing what i said for you to do above (with the 2 spheres)<br>
c: just make it 1 glowing sphere</p>
