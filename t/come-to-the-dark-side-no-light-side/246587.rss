a command for players to choose alliance / horde (like WOW) or nueteral if the player clicks alliance they get melee and a message says welcome to the alliance melee player in a box that pops up and all the rules for alliance and if horde is clicked they get mage armour and they get mage team 
if nueteral is clicked they get range/ or dont want a side to go on
