    <title>Where are stored the data for objects, npc etc?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-are-stored-the-data-for-objects-npc-etc/52576</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;ve tried the  HybridScape/Morpascape server, I&#39;ve started it locally, and could connect to it. I&#39;ve looked in the archive, there are only a few megabytes, and I can&#39;t believe all the objects, place, npc and data for the 3D objects game are stored into this. Are they downloaded from internet ? Where ?
Could you enlighten me about this ? It is possible to create new objects and add them to the regular world ?

Thank you in advance.</description>
