    <description>So,  just finished my project.. Just 2 problem&#39;s i dont understand..
When i do something to update(i mean code something and compile) and logging in with my char it spawns as new.. Sometimes even if didnt update the server..
And sometimes i try to login it shows me this in my server console
[code]
Connection from localhost:1058

        at client.run(client.java:16674)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)[/code]
But when i retry it lets me login and reset my char as new.
Or if i set my rights to 1 or 2 or 3 or higher and login sucessful without any reset it just disappaer after 10-15 mins im on and dont gives me logout and Im still with crown.
So problem is with player rights and something not good with my source.
And i dont want to change my source to any other because i done to much.
P.S. It was always..(i mean at the start i started code the source)
But i didnt knew that it has this problem so coded a lot..


Im useing Demise&#39;s PKING V5 source
Please help me with this!!! :(

If it will be loads of help i even gonna pay for it!!! :confused:</description>
