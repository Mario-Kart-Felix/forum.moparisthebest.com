    <title>When should police use lethal force?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/when-should-police-use-lethal-force/509280</link>
    <description>I saw a clip of a firefight here in Missouri today, and it made me question things.

A man who was in a car crash walked away from the accident unharmed, and the police tracked him to a nearby park a couple minutes later.  When the officer got out of the car, the man randomly opened fire without even saying a word.  The police shot him and he went down, basically bleeding out and was going to die if he wasn&#39;t treated.  The officers couldn&#39;t help him, though, because he was still pointing the gun at them, ready to fire after they would come out of cover.  He eventually died that night in the same exact spot, still holding the gun, the police still have weapons on him.

Now, it sounds like they did the right thing at first, right?  They weren&#39;t going to risk other lives to save one.  But as it turned out, the man was under the influence of both alcohol and drugs.  He didn&#39;t have any other violations with the law beforehand, and was mentally stable, meaning his most defiantly wouldn&#39;t do this if he wasn&#39;t on the substances.

So my question is, should the officers have tried to disarm and save the man because he isn&#39;t under control of his actions and thoughts, or did they do the right thing by letting him die?</description>

<p>Pretty much this from me. There could have been alternative methods to detain the man and give him aid, although we don’t know the full story. The police were correct to retaliate though, you can’t really have a drugged-up man with a gun running around the country, that can lead to bad news sometimes.</p>
<p>I come from a country where the average police officer doesn’t carry a fire arm, and it has its ups and downs to be honest. For example, there are occasions where there is an armed robbery and if the average police officer has to respond to it then it’s really men versus boys, and sometimes it can also lead to police fatalities unfortunately. With that being said, I also agree on police officers carrying some sort of fire arm, purely for our protection.</p>

              <p>Coming from a psychoanalytic approach I would assume this guy had resorted to drugs and alcohol because of something happening in his life which just completely destroyed all three of his balances, which is the ID, Ego and Super Ego. I mean, this is all just guess but for example, someone in his life may have passed away, or the love of his life broke up with him, destroying this guys Super Ego (the Super Ego is basically right from wrong) leading to an uncontrollable ID (the ID being ones instinctual demands e.g. food and milk as a baby). Meaning since the Super Ego has given up, the ID doesn’t know what’s right from wrong which in this case caused this guy to consume alcohol and drugs and possibly do what he did.</p>
<p>p.s.<br>
The ID: Demands, usually develops in the early Anal Stages in ones life span.<br>
The Ego: Tbh, i’m not positive but wiki says; the ego is the organized, realistic part.<br>
The SuperEgo: It’s one of the two most important and crucial function in the brain, tells us what is ethical (right and wrong).</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Wow, off topic completely…</p>

              <p>In my opinion, if someone is a potential risk, no matter the reason, they should have some form of punishment. In this case, I believe the officers did the right thing, even though the guy was probably mentally unstable. There isn’t much you can do when someone else is firing a weapon at you. I would protect myself and others if someone else was threatening my life.</p>
<p>Long story short, no matter why that guy was opening fire on the officers, he made the decision of using drugs beforehand. It would be different if someone forced him to use drugs, then gave him a weapon so that he could go on a rampage through the city, but that is really exaggerating.</p>

              <p>I saw a clip of a firefight here in Missouri today, and it made me question things.</p>
<p>A man who was in a car crash walked away from the accident unharmed, and the police tracked him to a nearby park a couple minutes later.  When the officer got out of the car, the man randomly opened fire without even saying a word.  The police shot him and he went down, basically bleeding out and was going to die if he wasn’t treated.  The officers couldn’t help him, though, because he was still pointing the gun at them, ready to fire after they would come out of cover.  He eventually died that night in the same exact spot, still holding the gun, the police still have weapons on him.</p>
<p>Now, it sounds like they did the right thing at first, right?  They weren’t going to risk other lives to save one.  But as it turned out, the man was under the influence of both alcohol and drugs.  He didn’t have any other violations with the law beforehand, and was mentally stable, meaning his most defiantly wouldn’t do this if he wasn’t on the substances.</p>
<p>So my question is, should the officers have tried to disarm and save the man because he isn’t under control of his actions and thoughts, or did they do the right thing by letting him die?</p>
