    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wildy-free-trade-thaughts/378483</link>
    <description>I know theres posts about this but i wanted to make my own! what is everyone going to do on monday when it comes back! i remember a long time ago the whole reason i quit is because i lagged following my friend and then next thing i know im in lumbrige with no purple partyhat so i quit because aparently he picked it up cuz someone killed me in wildy ( we were going to bandit ) and he killed the person... THE NEXT DAY WE GET TRADE RULE ! so i couldnt get my hat back ! and now my friend quit and put all his stuff in a fally party room! FIRST thing im doing is merchanting my bum off for a santa + ! Im bringin my pure back and taking over edgeville wildy :) (team wildy is just nonsence) . Merchanting is gona be hard cuz i used to buy lobbies for 200 and sell for 250 i made 70m with that and back in the day that could get u any partyhat AND a santa or 2 :P now the prices are just rediculus but ima work for it ! 

Sory for the novel but im just a big talker :P what is everyones plans and if u voted NO for the wildy/free trade well ... *words i cant say on moparscape* :) &lt;3

Note* Please excuse my grammar i can spell better but im canadian and its -21 atm and i can care less about a few letters</description>
