        <p>Eudemons Online is a free fantasy MMORPG. In this mythic world, you can choose to be a Warrior, Mage or Paladin. Command your heroes and eudemons to adventure on the vast land of Atlantis and challenge the power of sword and magic.</p>
<p>Raising eudemons, forging, training, mentor, family, legion, and other interesting features guarantee Eudemons Online highly interactive and addictive!</p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>Eudemons<br>
In the Eudemons Online, you can raise loyal eudemons to guard you and destroy your enemies. EO eudemon system provides more than 30 kinds of eudemons for the player. These eudemons possess their own unique combat skills. Some can self-destruct themselves or possess enemies` soul. Details</p>
<p>Gems<br>
In EO, the player may collect 8 types about 100 kinds of magic gems. The gems are different from common items, because they have various magic effects. They can increase your magic attack as well as strengthen your eudemon, and even change the fight formation sometimes. Details</p>
<p>Potency<br>
You can judge your opponent`s strength quickly by checking his/her potency. Potency is calculated on the basis of your attributes, equipment and eudemons, so it reflects your true strength. Potency is not only used to compare the strength, it plays an important part in game. If your potency is higher than your enemy, you are likely to kill him in a second. Details</p>
<p>Forging<br>
What the equipment brings to its owner is not only powerful attack and defence, but also extreme pride and honor! Each upgraded equipment records its owner`s name and his/her painstaking effort. The name of the forger will be written in the history of the game with the weapon. Details</p>
<p>Mentor System:<br>
EO ensures a new player becomes familiar with the game easily with the help of a mentor. Both mentors and apprentices can benefit greatly from the mentor system. The apprentices may level up quickly and his/her mentor will gain more EXP. A mentor will also level up after he/she reaches a certain amount and gain more benefits. This system will attract more players into EO and form a better game environment. Details</p>
<p>Four Mission System<br>
EO has Main mission, scene mission, random mission and quiz mission. The main mission forms the story of EO and shows its background. The random mission has various factors to make the player feel more curious, the quiz mission makes the game more complex and brings extra fun. Details</p>
<p>PK<br>
“Eudemons Online” changes the old rules of traditional online games and redefines the unspoken rules of PKing. Nobody will fight alone in “Eudemons Online”, for the eudemons will be your strongest support! Details</p>
<p>XP Skill<br>
The exciting experience of combat is everyone`s pursuit! You can experience the uniqueness of melee games in “Eudemons Online”. The XP bar will be added with time, you can activate it when the XP bar is full. XP skill is different from other skills, you can even kill boss monsters with ease in XP time. Details</p>
<p>Legion &amp; Competition<br>
The legion diplomacy and level, the power of appointment and removal, Eudemon Totems, bonus potency…The competition between the legions and members will become more challenging. Who will be the final winners?<br>
Details</p>
<p>Family<br>
A friend in need is a friend indeed. The best friends unite to create a family. A small family consists of a husband and wife, while a large family consists of 6 small families. The family members fight against the monsters to share the item drops and also the best potency. Now they are actively participating in the family war to occupy the maps and win the amazing rewards. It is said that the family members can even build their houses, territories and totems in the near future. Details</p>
<p>Arena and Death Island<br>
The Arena and Death Island are full of evils and dangers. Law does not exist to protect you from being harmed or killed. Your only rescue is your sword and magic. Trust no one but your eudemons and friends.</p>
