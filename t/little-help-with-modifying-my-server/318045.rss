    <title>Little help with modifying my server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/little-help-with-modifying-my-server/318045</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;m pretty well new to the website and the making of runescape private servers.
So just please tolerate a bit of confusion. ^^

I&#39;ve searched a little bit and I&#39;ve found a few helpful posts, but I would really prefer 
a direct feed of legitimate info directed to the exact topic. o.o

So I&#39;m using Mezzy-Scape source and client. o.o

How would I go about editing the experience rates, and what the npc&#39;s say
Along with the message of the day on the &#39;Click Here To Play&#39; login screen.
Very sorry if I&#39;m not being detailed. o.o

Also, how would I add/delete/place npc&#39;s?

If there is an available GUI program that would help me out with this. That would be great ^^

Also could someone link me to the command editor? &lt;--I&#39;ll keep looking for this, but still posting it
in here to get all the questions out that I would appreciate being answered.

Thanks,
