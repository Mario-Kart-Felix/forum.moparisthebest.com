    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/virus-help-please-i-got-a-crazy-virus/199640</link>
    <description>Hello I was doing a projet for english and I downloaded a book to help me on the topic and it was actually a TrojanDownload, It has disabled my task manager and I have pop ups like every minute saying my computer is infected with spyware to buy these Anti-Virus programs. It has also changes my desktop background to a light blue that says &quot;your computer is infected click here to fix it.

Any help would be great thanks I did a whole bunch of virus scans with AVG and McAfee but the virus keeps comming back.</description>
