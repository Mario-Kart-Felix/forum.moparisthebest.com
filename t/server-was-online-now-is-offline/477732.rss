    <title>Server Was Online Now is Offline?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-was-online-now-is-offline/477732</link>
    <description>If this is in the wrong section please move it as i am new to Moparscape as a registered member.(Ive been coming here for years now but never bothered to register and note what can be posted where)

My problem is that a few days ago my server (Running InsidiaX base) was online for the first time and was running and working perfectly fine and my friend was able to log in without issues. I created a test webclient and other people could join that as well just fine. I took the webclient down that same day because it was just a test and after a few days of coding I went back to re-add the webclient and it said &quot;Your server has to be online to be added.&quot; and I was confused because my server had been working fine for days. I didn&#39;t mess with my client.java,environmental variables, Utorrent (only used this to portforword because final step of my router portforwording page wouldn&#39;t load) or anything like that. Anyone have the same problem or know what i could try to fix it? -Note, I do indeed have common sense and a brain so no stupid posts like &quot;Did you change the IP in client.java crap. Thanks for any help I receive. :p
