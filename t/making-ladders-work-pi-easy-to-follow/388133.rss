    <title>Making Ladders work [PI] Easy to follow</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-ladders-work-pi-easy-to-follow/388133</link>
    <description>Purpose: Making Ladders work
Difficulty:3/10
Assumed Knowledge:Common Sense, Copy and Paste.
Classes Modified: ActionHandler.java
Tested On(if it applies): Project Insanity

Please don&#39;t Flame, this is my first tutorial on this website.
Also if you already know this, we don&#39;t need to know... this is to help people just starting to learn, that would otherwise not know how to do this.
I will also be making the ladder in Zaff&#39;s staff shop in varrock work.


Step 1 - Get on your server and stand by the ladder you wish to activate.

Step 2 - Click on the ladder, it should do nothing, look in the cmd-window, that does not say &quot;Client&quot;, It will say the Name of your server like &quot;Project Insanity&quot;. In there it should say:
objectId: ___ ObjectX: ___ objectY: ____

This Tells you the Id, and the location (where I have ___&#39;s there is actual things on your cmd-window as shown in this picture)
[IMG]http://i845.photobucket.com/albums/ab17/coolguyvictor/cmdpic.jpg[/img]

Step 3 - Open up ActionHandler.java

When this is open, search for the object Id, like in the picture you would search for &quot;1747&quot;.

If you find it, it should look like..
[code]case 1747:[/code]

If you can&#39;t find it you must add by typing this... (add it under any case)
[code]case 1747:[/code]

Step 4 - 

now under your new case 1747: put this in...
[code]if (c.objectX == 3202 &amp;&amp; c.objectY == 3434){
		c.startAnimation(828);
		c.getPA().movePlayer(3202, 3433, 1);[/code]

..Now what does all this do? the first line is an &quot;if&quot; statement, where it says c.objectX == 3202, that is the X coords of where your object is resting, Same with c.objectY, those are the Y coords of where it is at. We get those from the black cmd window in the picture. The &amp;&amp; operator makes it so that if the objectX is there &quot;And&quot; it is at Y, do the following... &quot;{&quot; The brace is very important because that is telling it to group the two next lines (without it, it would only do one line.)

c.startAnimation(828), is telling the game that when you click the ladder you want to do the ladder climb emote. which is (828).

c.getPA().movePlayer(3202, 3433, 1);, is going to move the player to the coords, the first coord &quot;3202&quot; is the Xcoords, the second &quot;3433&quot; is the Ycoords, the &quot;1&quot; is the Height level in game. These coordinates are telling the ladder where to take you basically... so you can use ::mypos, in project insanity in game to find your coordinates, then put them in that line of code and the ladder will take you there. Make sure you have the height level right because we are going to be teleporting to upstairs in zaff&#39;s so it should be &quot;1&quot; some places are in a dungeon underground but they still are 0, so be careful.

After all of that, end it with a closing brace &quot;}&quot;.

Then to make the game know it is done we use this.
[code]break;[/code]

Now overall, your ladder code to get you to the second level of zaff&#39;s shop should read as this.
[code]case 1747:
		if (c.objectX == 3202 &amp;&amp; c.objectY == 3434){
		c.startAnimation(828);
		c.getPA().movePlayer(3202, 3433, 1);
		}
		break;[/code]

Save your ActionHandler.java and compile your server, then when you get on it should take you upstairs in zaff&#39;s shop, you can do this with any other object that allows you to &#39;enter&#39; or &#39;climb&#39; etc on your server (They have different codes though so use that cmd box to find them out).

To make the ladder go down all you have to do is repeat the steps but make it c.getPA().movePlayer(3202, 3433, 0) instead of height 1.


Also, the ladder case at the top is not the same number as the bottom one. so be sure to change this!
Example: This is for the bottom ladder.
[code]case 1747:[/code]

Now to make it go down you must change the case and make it bring you to the level &quot;0&quot; as seen the case changes to 1746, because it is a different in game object. (the ladder going up is a different model than the ladder going down)
[code]    case 1746: //zaff ladder down
        if (c.objectX == 3202 &amp;&amp; c.objectY == 3434){
        c.startAnimation(828);
        c.getPA().movePlayer(3202, 3433, 0);
        }[/code]

I hope this was helpful to people.

Congratulations, you also just won an award:<br>
The worst comment ever in retaliation to a comment that made sense.</p>
<p>This is more or less common sense, there’s hardly any code involved and it’s basic code, good job with it and what not but try and make a little more advanced tutorials in future.</p>

              <p>Purpose: Making Ladders work<br>
Difficulty:3/10<br>
Assumed Knowledge:Common Sense, Copy and Paste.<br>
Classes Modified: ActionHandler.java<br>
Tested On(if it applies): Project Insanity</p>
<p>Please don’t Flame, this is my first tutorial on this website.<br>
Also if you already know this, we don’t need to know… this is to help people just starting to learn, that would otherwise not know how to do this.<br>
I will also be making the ladder in Zaff’s staff shop in varrock work.</p>
<p>Step 1 - Get on your server and stand by the ladder you wish to activate.</p>
<p>Step 2 - Click on the ladder, it should do nothing, look in the cmd-window, that does not say “Client”, It will say the Name of your server like “Project Insanity”. In there it should say:<br>
objectId: ___ ObjectX: ___ objectY: ____</p>
<p>This Tells you the Id, and the location (where I have ___'s there is actual things on your cmd-window as shown in this picture)<br>
<img src="http://i845.photobucket.com/albums/ab17/coolguyvictor/cmdpic.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Step 3 - Open up ActionHandler.java</p>
<p>When this is open, search for the object Id, like in the picture you would search for “1747”.</p>
<p>If you find it, it should look like…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>If you can’t find it you must add by typing this… (add it under any case)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Step 4 -</p>
<p>now under your new case 1747: put this in…</p>
<p><code>if (c.objectX == 3202 &amp;&amp; c.objectY == 3434){
		c.startAnimation(828);
		c.getPA().movePlayer(3202, 3433, 1);</code></p>
<p>…Now what does all this do? the first line is an “if” statement, where it says c.objectX == 3202, that is the X coords of where your object is resting, Same with c.objectY, those are the Y coords of where it is at. We get those from the black cmd window in the picture. The &amp;&amp; operator makes it so that if the objectX is there “And” it is at Y, do the following… “{” The brace is very important because that is telling it to group the two next lines (without it, it would only do one line.)</p>
<p>c.startAnimation(828), is telling the game that when you click the ladder you want to do the ladder climb emote. which is (828).</p>
<p>c.getPA().movePlayer(3202, 3433, 1);, is going to move the player to the coords, the first coord “3202” is the Xcoords, the second “3433” is the Ycoords, the “1” is the Height level in game. These coordinates are telling the ladder where to take you basically… so you can use ::mypos, in project insanity in game to find your coordinates, then put them in that line of code and the ladder will take you there. Make sure you have the height level right because we are going to be teleporting to upstairs in zaff’s so it should be “1” some places are in a dungeon underground but they still are 0, so be careful.</p>
<p>After all of that, end it with a closing brace “}”.</p>
<p>Then to make the game know it is done we use this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Now overall, your ladder code to get you to the second level of zaff’s shop should read as this.</p>
<p><code>case 1747:
		if (c.objectX == 3202 &amp;&amp; c.objectY == 3434){
		c.startAnimation(828);
		c.getPA().movePlayer(3202, 3433, 1);
		}
		break;</code></p>
<p>Save your ActionHandler.java and compile your server, then when you get on it should take you upstairs in zaff’s shop, you can do this with any other object that allows you to ‘enter’ or ‘climb’ etc on your server (They have different codes though so use that cmd box to find them out).</p>
<p>To make the ladder go down all you have to do is repeat the steps but make it c.getPA().movePlayer(3202, 3433, 0) instead of height 1.</p>
<p>Also, the ladder case at the top is not the same number as the bottom one. so be sure to change this!<br>
Example: This is for the bottom ladder.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Now to make it go down you must change the case and make it bring you to the level “0” as seen the case changes to 1746, because it is a different in game object. (the ladder going up is a different model than the ladder going down)</p>
<p><code>    case 1746: //zaff ladder down
        if (c.objectX == 3202 &amp;&amp; c.objectY == 3434){
        c.startAnimation(828);
        c.getPA().movePlayer(3202, 3433, 0);
        }</code></p>
<p>I hope this was helpful to people.<br>
