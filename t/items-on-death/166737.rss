    <title>Items on death</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/items-on-death/166737</link>
    <description>Hey, uhh.. I&#39;ve been looking at my applydead methods, and where they drop their items on death, but yet i can&#39;t figure this out..

When someone dies with a stackable item, and you pick it up after killing them, it sometimes turns into like 500k of that item..

So say you have like 50 death runes in your invent, you kill someone and they drop some deaths... You pick them up, and you have 500k deaths in your invent..

It sometimes takes after other items in your inv.

Say you had 900m cash in invent, killed someone, picked up deaths, you would have 900m deaths in invent..

How can i stop this? Just picking up the right ammount of what the player had?</description>
