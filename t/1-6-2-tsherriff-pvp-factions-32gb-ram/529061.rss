    <description>TSherriff PvP Factions Server [NEW!]


We are a community driven factions based PvP server. We feel that is important to listen to what the players want, and many of the features you will find on our server are completely unique and based on player feedback. 

Unlike a lot of other Minecraft servers, we do not use a standard Minecraft hosting company. All of our servers are run on completely dedicated hardware to ensure maximum flexibility, uptime and a lag-free environment for our players. 

TSherriff MC runs on the following hardware: 

Intel速 Xeon速 Processor E3-1290V2 
32GB ECC RAM 
1 Gbps dedicated network connection 
Solid state drives to speed data loads 
Daily backups of world + plugin data 

Features: 

Faction server 
Unique donator ranks 
Mineable spawners 
Buy most if not everything @ shops 
Unprotected chest 
Player Shops for donators 
Arenas - MobArena, FFA, PVP!

Plugins: 

Factions - Includes custom commands such as /fchat ally/faction/public 
mcMMO - Completely rebalanced, no more overpowered skills or abilities 
ObbyDestroyer - Obsidian breaks from 15 direct hits from TNT 
Spawner - Mineable spawners using silk touch available to donators only</description>
