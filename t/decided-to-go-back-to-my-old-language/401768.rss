    <title>Decided to go back to my old Language</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/decided-to-go-back-to-my-old-language/401768</link>
    <description>This is the first programming language that I ever learned. It is known as Ruby and RGSS2. Its the new scripting language for RPG Maker VX which you can get here for free: http://up.ht/isq5q9

This is the scripts needed to make an online mmo. If you are still new and dont understand Ruby/RGSS2 then I suggest you go here first: http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/tutorial/rpg-maker-vx

This is not a tutorial just an engine. Intended for intermediate users. You can get a pre-made client and server engine here with no programming knowledge required!: http://up.ht/iLEcsM

That is great advise, and Im not shutting it down, but Im not doing it as a oh im trying to get rich or make some huge hit game, Im just doin this for fun in my spare time. Ruby is a decent language and I can and have made my own games with it Im honestly just to lazy to start from scratch.

Let me just say this, this is not a language, this is a drag and drop program. The fact that you would post this and expect positive feedback is beyond me.<br>
[/quote]Do some research. Thats all Im gonna say. Without using Ruby and RGSS2 you could not have a great game. The drag and drop is limited and you cant have a very unique game using it. My suggestion, if your not gonna learn the language dont even download this or you will waste your time.[/quote]<br>
I have done all the research I need in the past two years of my life to know that this is not real programming, pick up a damn java book and actually write a game if you ever want to call the shit you put out decent.</p>

Let me just say this, this is not a language, this is a drag and drop program. The fact that you would post this and expect positive feedback is beyond me.<br>
[/quote]Do some research. Thats all Im gonna say. Without using Ruby and RGSS2 you could not have a great game. The drag and drop is limited and you cant have a very unique game using it. My suggestion, if your not gonna learn the language dont even download this or you will waste your time.[/quote]If your serious in game developing, then stop using those shitty game makerish software and learn a REAL language, a language that has showed success in the game developing platform.</p>
