This character now has 40 attack 33 str 45 magic 1 defence 61 range 50 hp 33 agility 34 mining 47 fisihng 61 cooking 64 firemaking and 62 wcing. Don&#39;t play on it that much so dont say it sucks and I know the combat stats are pretty much messed up.
And I dont have many pics on my comp so thats why It is not that old.
picture possibly took in january 2007 or in december 2006. I KNOW IT SUCKS I DO NOT PLAY ON IT.
THE NAME OF THE ACCOUNT IS C_H_A_P_S
GRRRR

PLEASE RATE THE STATS OF THE PICTURE ABOVE NOT THE STATS ATM 1/10 
AND I WILL POST A PIC OF THE BANK AND THE STATS SOON IM GONNA GO OUTSIDE NOW AND PLAY ! I AM NO NERD.

AND 46 CB NOW!</description>
