    <description>How to get it all moving


An MS-DOS prompt is the best way to do stuff, because most admins don&#39;t think its possible to get them and, if they do, they just can&#39;t do anything much about it.
First, open a notepad file (if your school blocks notepad, open a webpage, right click and go to view source. hey presto, notepad!). Now, write
command.com
and save the file as batch.bat, or anything with the extension .bat . Open this file and it will give you a command prompt (for more information on why this works, look to the end of the article). REMEMBER TO DELETE THIS FILE ONCE YOU&#39;VE FINISHED!!! if the admins see it, they will kill you

Bypassing that pesky web filtering


Well, now you&#39;ve got a command prompt, it&#39;s time to visit whatever site you want. Now, there are plenty of ways to bypass poorly constructed filtering, but I&#39;m going to take it for granted that your school has stopped these. This one, as far as I know, will never be stopped.
in your command prompt, type
ping hackthissite.org
or anything else you wanna visit. Now you should have a load of info, including delay times and, most importantly, an IP address for the website. Simply type this IP address into the address bar, preceded by http://, and you&#39;ll be able to access the page!
For example: http://197.57.189.10 etc.
Now, I&#39;ve noticed a lot of people have been saying that there are other ways to bypass web filtering, and there are. I am only mentioning the best method I know. Others you might want to try are:
1) Using a translator, like Altavista&#39;s Babel fish, to translate the page from japanese of something to english. This will bypass the filtering and won&#39;t translate the page, since it&#39;s already in English.
2) When you search up the site on Google, there will be a link saying &#39;Cache&#39;. Click that and you should be on.
3) Use a proxy. I recommend Proxify.com. If your school has blocked it, search it up on Google and do the above. Then you can search to your heart&#39;s content

Sending messages out over the network


Okay, here&#39;s how to send crazy messages to everyone in your school on a computer. In your command prompt, type
Net Send * &quot;The server is h4x0r3d&quot;
*Note: may not be necessary, depending on how many your school has access too. If it&#39;s just one, you can leave it out*
Where is, replace it with the domain name of your school. For instance, when you log on to the network, you should have a choice of where to log on, either to your school, or to just the local machine. It tends to be called the same as your school, or something like it. So, at my school, I use
Net Send Varndean * &quot;The server is h4x0r3d&quot;
The asterisk denotes wildcard sending, or sending to every computer in the domain. You can swap this for people&#39;s accounts, for example
NetSend Varndean dan,jimmy,admin &quot;The server is h4x0r3d&quot;
use commas to divide the names and NO SPACES between them.

Adding/modifying user accounts


Now that you have a command prompt, you can add a new user (ie yourself) like so
C:&gt;net user username /ADD
where username is the name of your new account. And remember, try and make it look inconspicuous, then they&#39;ll just think its a student who really is at school, when really, the person doesn&#39;t EXIST! IF you wanna have a password, use this instead:
C:&gt;net user username password /ADD
where password is the password you want to have. So for instance the above would create an account called &#39;username&#39;, with the password being &#39;password&#39;. The below would have a username of &#39;JohnSmith&#39; and a password of &#39;fruity&#39;
C:&gt;net user JohnSmith fruity /ADD
Right then, now that we can create accounts, let&#39;s delete them
C:&gt;net user JohnSmith /DELETE
This will delete poor liddle JohnSmith&#39;s account. Awww. Do it to you enemies no only joking becuase they could have important work... well okay only if you REALLY hate them
Let&#39;s give you admin priveleges C:&gt;net localgroup administrator JohnSmith /ADD
This will make JohnSmith an admin. Remember that some schools may not call their admins &#39;adminstrator&#39; and so you need to find out the name of the local group they belong to.
You can list all the localgroups by typing C:&gt;net localgroup

Running .exe files you can&#39;t usually run


In the command prompt, use cd (change directory) to go to where the file is, use DIR to get the name of it, and put a shortcut of it on to a floppy. Run the program off the floppy disk.
Well, I hope this article helped a bit. Please vote for me if you liked it Also, please don&#39;t go round screwing up your school servers, they are providing them free to you to help your learning.
I will add more as I learn more and remember stuff (I think I&#39;ve left some stuff out - this article could get very long...)</description>
