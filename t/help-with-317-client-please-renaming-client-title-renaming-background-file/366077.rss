    <title>Help with 317 Client please. (Renaming Client title, Renaming Background File)</title>

    <description>Hey guys, I have encountered some problems with my 317 clients. Hopefully you guys out there can help me out.  ;)

1) I know that to change a client background to mine can be done by deleting the old background picture and uploading the new one and renaming it to the same name as the old one but I would want to rename my new background picture to the name of my own, how can it be done?

2) How can I name my client with a title on the java client?

3) How do I remove the old login box and change it with my own custom one and make sure that it&#39;s working fine? (I tried deleting &quot;loginbox&quot; from the spirits file and the whole client went screwed up ^^

Thanks you in advance.

Sincerely,</description>

<p>No.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The background image name is in sprite.java, just search the current image name and you will find it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the title is in Frame_Sub.java, or something along those lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The login box sprite is in the cache, you can use Tom’ s Cache Suite to unpack the cache, switch out the image, and repack the cache to its original file type.</p>
