    <description>I need somebody to make my client a jar. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing wrong. I&#39;ve followed many tutorials on the internet and I&#39;m still getting &quot;Cannot find main-class: client&quot; when I run the newly jarred and signed client.. Can anyone help me? I have teamviewer, MSN, and Skype.

Source and Client is: ErasedPkz

Thanks in advance to anyone who helps!!!</description>
