              <p>For one, make sure you’re loading your cache right. Check the signlink and find out where cache is sappose to be, see if it’s there. If it’s not, you have to find your cache and put it there.</p>

Is there a folder named cache in that directory?</p>
<p>-edit: Just find where your cache folder is, then just put that path into the folder that has the path to your cache or something.<br>

<p>Where do you see a directory? What directory? …Or something? I don’t understand. You’re going to have to really dumb it down for me man. I’m a newbie. You pro-coders forget what it was like to be a noob. D:[/quote]</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m not one of the “pro-coders”. I’m just as new to programming as you but a little more knowledge of Java.</p>
<p>Ok. So here is what I’m talking about. There should be a folder called signlink.java. Ok open that up, scroll down or do ctrl + f and search for “cache”. Go to that method, and then either post it here and see if I can help or use the google bar and see how to change your path to your cache in your source.</p>
