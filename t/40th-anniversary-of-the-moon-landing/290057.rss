    <description>i just saw the stupid little google image and it made me think about the whole is it real or not thing, so im gonna ask you, was it real or not? and put your reason why.

EDIT-i think maybe. cause i saw the mythbusters episode. and now i see some pictures that make me think no.</description>

              <p>There are no stars on the background of photo’s on the moon, because of light exposure. The moon reflects a lot of light, so if your shutter is open too long the photo’s are ruined. I doubt you can make a picture of stars when it’s dark outside, but you are in a snowy area and the moon is bright.</p>

              <p>The early Apollo missions scouted the areas where the LLM’s took place, so they knew where the Reflectors were placed. Also, the recent photographs from the moon, showing the forms of the landing sites also help prove that.</p>
<p>The retro-reflectors had to be installed by the way. Heavy pieces that couldn’t possibly be installed with the technology used then. Especially when the Firmware behind the computers on the Lunar Lander weren’t even capable of processing all the data themselves during the landing process, so how could they be expected to have enough AI to actually travel on the moon, place the reflectors there, and then open them.</p>
<p>Don’t say they could’ve done it later on. Because after they were installed they were most likely used when the technology caught up with the idea. Still before the time of Modern Computers.</p>
<p>EDIT: I take back what I said, I recall the Lunokhod rover missions from the Soviets. Which did in fact place reflectors on the moon, and it took place in 1970.</p>

I don’t doubt the facts, I just said that the hitting the reflectors in Mythbusters did not prove anything.<br>
How do they know where to hit?<br>
Also it does not prove that humans placed the reflector there.</p>

<p>You could argue that propaganda could be used to make people commit suicide. A major hype about the end of the world through the media could trigger a large number of suicides, even if it were all just a lie. But I see your point, the government does not have devices or some kind of poisonous gas that will make you do whatever they want. There is always free will.</p>

<p>The laser does not prove anything, but they proved all the things that crazy people said was faked.<br>
They would never send people to the moon again if it was fake, there is a little chance that the first moon-landing was fake(Made a fake moonlanding to be faster than the Russians), but there is no doubt that USA went to the moon for real.</p>

              <p>Once again, their earlier statement goes against what you just said. The sun is closer than the star Proxima Centauri, which this scene was in direct light of the sun, causing the exposure of the photograph to not show some of the stars. This is basic photography.</p>

              <p>maybe its just me but daytime would have a effect, but since your already in space it should help shouldnt it?</p>
<p>there is a star called Proxima Centauri- its a red dwarf star with a apparent magnitude of m-11(brightness). this star can be seen 4.2 lightyears away. now, a “star” has a small m-6, but is 100 times brighter than proxima. now, since the moon is already 238855 miles away from earth. figuring to be 384400 kilometers. but what im getting at, is i guess you could say the moon is “closer” or whatever, maybe its bullshit, but since the moon could be 23885 miles closer to the stars, and with no atmosphere to block, and these stars are buring 100,000 degrees farenheight. the core temp sometimes can be a huge 200,000,000. thats 200 million. thats 175 million more degrees than the sun (25 million-sun) these stars are burning so bright, i mean havent you ever seen stars during the day sometimes? it rarely happens but i have. so all that shouldnt affect it, the moon is way the hell out there, along with the stars, maybe its just me, but thanks for replying, i wanted kind of a small argument lol, thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
