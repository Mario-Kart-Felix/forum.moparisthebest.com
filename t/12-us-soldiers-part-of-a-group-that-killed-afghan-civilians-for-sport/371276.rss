Wow it&#39;s not often that you catch 12 serial killers simultaneously. There must be some environmental variable that&#39;s causing them to behave this way - US military anyone?</description>

<p>How it works is that Alqaeda is easily able to recruit youth who are frustrated at the state of their countries which are victims of US foreign policy.</p>
<p>In Iraq for example, after the US destroyed the country and empowered the pro-Iranian shia muslims, Alqaeda gave hope to many sunnis that they would resist American occupation and overthrow the pro-Iranian government. Generally speaking, members of Alqaeda in Iraq were victims of the American-backed shia government who would send death squads to sunni areas and systematically torture the people on a large scale.</p>

Shit I was really out of it, still kind of am but hopefully this makes more sense. Basically, I mean that both of you start from valid points and make assumptions that aren’t as valid to people outside of those sharing your perspective - hence the disconnect and inability to accept the other side. It’s not an attack upon either you, it’s a crime many (I refuse to use ‘all’ as it’s too generalizing) are guilty of. It’s not even a crime, merely a facet of the way we think, in my opinion. I’ll reread the thread and procure a relevant example if necessary at another time. I’m not disagreeing with you, in fact I agree with you on a lot of the things you say - but I question my motives, am I agreeing with you because I truly agree, or because I’m bashing Frell? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Heh.

<p>More of a form of influence rather than racism. Racism is hating all Muslims because of 9/11, or no reason whatsoever. But if a Muslim walks onto a plane and you get nervous you’re profiling.</p>

</aside>
<p>“prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on such a belief” - The definition of racism according to the Oxford English Dictionary. I would consider that hypothetical case of profiling prejudice, hence racism, although perhaps it came about through a social context such as media portrayal etc. instead of straight hate.</p>

<p>One of the main sources of this frustration is American foreign policy.</p>

<p>You’re anti American from what i can tell (you haven’t once denied it), a Muslim sympathizer (So you’re probably also Muslim), and at one point i called you radicalized. Im just American, i don’t have anything against Muslims, so i wont go on about how messed up the middle east has been since after WW2 or the way some Muslims think. But you constantly talk about the American military supporting crime because of little incidents, us forcing “evil” governments onto people etc. Our government has its problems, but it very well isn’t evil. But even Britain was seen as evil back when it was a super power, it comes with the deal.</p>

<p>I am not anti-American - I only dislike the American government. You see unlike you, I am open-minded. I won’t let my opinion of America or Americans be predetermined as a result of the actions of the American government. I don’t believe that American foreign policy is what the people of America want, rather I see it as the position of a few individuals who are heavily influenced by money and Jewish organizations such as AIPAC.</p>

But when you listen to media like mouth piece aljazerra, they will very well look like freedom fighters when they make every American look evil. But if you watch CNN, FOX, and MSNBC etc they wont make every Muslim look evil. America has gone out of its way to say “its not all Muslims”.</p>
<p>You’re anti American from what i can tell (you haven’t once denied it), a Muslim sympathizer (So you’re probably also Muslim), and at one point i called you radicalized. Im just American, i don’t have anything against Muslims, so i wont go on about how messed up the middle east has been since after WW2 or the way some Muslims think. But you constantly talk about the American military supporting crime because of little incidents, us forcing “evil” governments onto people etc. Our government has its problems, but it very well isn’t evil. But even Britain was seen as evil back when it was a super power, it comes with the deal.</p>
<p>What organization do you want to be in? Because you definitely aren’t arguing from a neutral or leaned view, you’re laying on your side. Its not “The terrorists did _____, yes, but the US shouldn’t have done _____ to stop it.” For you its “America did this ______, evil bastards, and the freedom fighters did _______.”</p>

              <p>Take a bunch of different incidents and attribute them to a single imaginary group that intends to flourish the world with evil. Wake up. The reality of the situation is that people are frustrated at America for backing the governments which openly oppress them. These people are generally uneducated and therefore ignorant (just like you) so they end up venting out their frustration in an unreasonable manner.</p>
<p>I am sorry that your brother was sent to Afghanistan and I’m sure you would be horrified if he were to be killed fighting an unjust war. Rather than looking for a purpose to make the war justified and hence satisfying your ego, you should be exerting your effort in attempt to save him from your government wasting his life.</p>

<p>Few years back i supported the war because of 9/11, then i sorta felt the war was pointless and we should leave. And then your posts lead me to read, then my brother went to Afghanistan and i became more interested, along with my father becoming a professor (Political Science, not so much US History). And remember, i support the war being justified. I do believe what we are doing over there could have been done very, very differently.</p>
