        <p>Yeah, but not all of the insurgents are terrorists. Many of those fighting against the coalition forces are regular people fighting for their country. People who were by any regular standard, good citizens, they have legitimate jobs, looked after their family and didn’t take in the extremist interpretations of islam of the Taliban (who before the invasion, controlled much of Afghanistan).</p>
<p>These people started fighting when the USA removed leadership and replaced it with ‘Placeholders’ that wouldn’t work in favor of much of the population, because they were all Shia muslims - whereas much of the population in Afghanistan is Sunni (It may be the other way around), so it was those in the leadership positions that were sometimes making decisions that only harmed the current population - like, despite knowing the risks to civilians in Fallujah, they shown no resistance to the US plans to launch an attack on the city - all because much of the insurgency was dominated by either Sunni or Shia muslims (Again, can’t remember which way around) and any help in decreasing the chances of them eventually taking power.</p>
<p>So you also need to remember that all those fighting against the coalition forces aren’t the evil cunts who will blow up markets full of their own people, but people just trying to defend their country from irresponsible decisions from the invading forces. The same people who have explained that they were originally for the US coming to “liberate” the people from the Taliban control, but eventually saw it wasn’t that simple and some considerably harmful actions were being made with little consideration for the people.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is that such soliders should be treated with as much respect as those from the coalition, we have moved on from taking trophies from corpses.</p>

I agree with the majority of your post. But Iraq and Afghanistan are civilized to an extent that I doubt any “good” citizen would be picking shots at forces with a sniper rifle or running into the street with an RPG. As a matter of fact (serious question), how easy is it to access weapons in these countries? Either way, its these activities that are distracting and postponing the US from actually stabilizing the country.</p>
<p>As to the groups fighting for power, a suggested solution was to divide Iraq into 3 countries. But the problem with this is all of the oil is in one region.</p>

        <p>A good citizen looking to rid their country of the occupiers that, in their opinion are making poor, irresponsible decisions. They join insurgency groups (not all of them are terrorists) to help in the fight.</p>
<p>They’re good citizens in the same sense that, many of the RAF fighter pilots who fought off hitlers attack on Britain were mostly regular, good citizens. If you imagine the RAF being an unofficial insurgency group who will provide those who fight for them with planes to help defend the country.</p>

        <p>I can see Mopar’s point of view regarding trophies – being a trophy collector, while kinda gross when your ‘prey’ is human, doesn’t inherently make you a murderer. However, as civilians, these people shouldn’t have been considered party to the theatre of war; they weren’t ‘fair game’.</p>
<p>Anyway, I still don’t have a definitive answer to my question above (death by firing squad). The British had it back in the day (“Shoot straight, you bastards! Don’t make a mess of it!”), and may still. I’ve never heard of American soldiers being punished by death though.<br>
In my opinion, killing is right and just when done under the right circumstances. I don’t agree with drawing it out (ie, torturing someone first), but I’d happily blow the brains out of any rapist/pedophile/murderer – especially those that committed crimes against children.</p>

        <p>I don’t think we have firing squad anymore, but even then, the abolishment of capital punishment in the UK probably ruled it out, you never know - it could be brought back under special circumstances. I think a better one would having the Queen personally come down and chop off your head. That’d be epic.</p>

Pretty fucked up. How come there isn’t any death by firing squad for soldiers anymore? There probably should be.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I thought there was still, at least I’m pretty sure you can still be shot for treason in this country.</p>
<p>If this is true, I hope they are shot, all murderers deserve to be put down.  But I don’t think taking ‘trophies’ necessarily means they weren’t justified kills, people have done that for thousands of years during war, and while it might not be right, it doesn’t mean they are guilty of murder.</p>
<p>Also, this sounds familiar.  Seems like I heard somewhere else recently about ‘soldiers’ killing civilians for sport and cutting off parts of their bodies like heads and such.  Oh yea, the terrorists the USA is there to get rid of do that.  Also, they are proud of it and record it and broadcast it on TV.  It’s not often that you see that many psychos simultaneously. There must be some environmental variable that’s causing them to behave this way - Muslim religion anyone?  (I’m not in any way trying to say all Muslims are terrorists, just pointing out how flawed Radeon’s identical assertion above is)[/quote]</p>
<p>You forgot one other variable that these ‘terrorists’ are exposed to. Oh yeah that would be war, and generally in war the goal is to kill the invaders and their supporters. But hey I guess the US soldiers are exposed to the very same war… But then again the ‘terrorists’ don’t do it as means of sport, rather they do it to resist the forceful implementation of a very much proven evil government.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/frell-2.html">@Frell</a>, you’ve confessed that you haven’t read anything about the war in Afghanistan and your posts indicate you know hardly anything about it. So please, your opinion here is obsolete.</p>

<p>Funny, i never said anything about Afghanistan. It was generalized to Iraq and Afghanistan and it was barely even about the war. And i don’t know alot about the Afghanistan war, which is why i am lightly voicing my opinion.</p>
