&lt;blockquote&gt;Well this is just a project I&#39;ve been working on but recently I thought of an old server I used to play which was a lot of fun but unfortunately I&#39;ve forgotten the name of it but yeah just something I&#39;ve decided to do while im bored will be decided whether or not it&#39;ll be hosted.

The server base itself is a Project insanity based server and galkon&#39;s 474 look-alike modified a bit more the server will be worked on and updated on a daily basis.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
