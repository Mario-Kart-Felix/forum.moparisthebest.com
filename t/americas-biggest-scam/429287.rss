<p>This is a scam worth hundreds of millions of dollars these company’s are paying into members of congress. Congress members are taking bribes to pass this bill just like they did with the whole “Bailout” thing. 2 men were found taking millions after the whole bailout happened. That is exactly what will happen if this gets passed. People are going to be paid for helping pass the bill, and these company’s like Viacom will take legal action to anyone who posts copyrighted material.</p>
<p>People don’t see how harsh this is. MoparScape/Moparisthebest can and most likely will be terminated forever if this bill passes.<br>
That’s including the rest of these RSPS sites/servers. This is hitting our community right at heart and people are too ignorant to see that. That’s why I made this topic to help push it out there a little more. Even if 1 person takes this to another site or their friend, they are helping people learn what is really going on.</p>

like the government cares about some guys putting their own website offline or some dude ^OP  spreading some vids</p>
<p>anyways I’m back downloading on the deep web, and I feel it’s going to get more active, once those bills are passed</p>

<p>That is 359 major companies in America that are currently supporting SOPA. You can see quite a few type of companies in there that I talked about before.</p>
<p>Our Government was made by the people for the people and is ran by greedy companies who only want more money.</p>

This is a scam worth hundreds of millions of dollars these company’s are paying into members of congress. Congress members are taking bribes to pass this bill just like they did with the whole “Bailout” thing. 2 men were found taking millions after the whole bailout happened. That is exactly what will happen if this gets passed. People are going to be paid for helping pass the bill, and these company’s like Viacom will take legal action to anyone who posts copyrighted material.</p>
<p>People don’t see how harsh this is. MoparScape/Moparisthebest can and most likely will be terminated forever if this bill passes.<br>
That’s including the rest of these RSPS sites/servers. This is hitting our community right at heart and people are too ignorant to see that. That’s why I made this topic to help push it out there a little more. Even if 1 person takes this to another site or their friend, they are helping people learn what is really going on.<br>

Finally someone with a brain. The only way to get past SOPA after the bill is passed, would be to have a password protected website.[/quote]</p>
<p>You need to know what’s going on in your world let alone your country</p>
