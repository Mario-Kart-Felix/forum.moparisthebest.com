    <title>Adding 634 graphics to 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-634-graphics-to-317/385908</link>
    <description>I need a tutorial on how to get the graphics from runescape and convert them to a 317
I got 634 items and 602 animations and gfx&#39;s and some 525 graphics now what I want is a full 634 interface and characters... graphics and all to pimp up the server a little bit more!
Ive managed to make the client load the 634 items faster which is a great thing... Anyway graphics. Upload them? or send me a tool to get fetch the files from them
