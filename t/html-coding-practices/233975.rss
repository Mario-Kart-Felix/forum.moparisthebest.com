    <title>Html coding practices</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/html-coding-practices/233975</link>
    <description>hello friends :) im back :)

well i love helping you all but some stuff i see lacked is html coding...lets take a breif moment to say what html coding is...

html coding is coding for inserting files from your computer onto a website like videos and clients.

so im sure most of you guys are wondering well now that you tell me this is silab client an html embeded code? the answer is yes.

some may be saying well i know what html&#39;s are but how do i insert one?

the answer to that question is simple...the best site too make a server forums or whatever on is www.freewebs.com

this is good because it automatically has stuff where you can insert html codes off the toolbar it gives you...

a simple html code always begins and ends with theses &lt; or &gt;

these are most important because it tells if there is a line of text or a line of files... most ads use these and these are ads on pages like google adds and yahoo ads...

now your probably saying...what are you trying to teach us.. the answer is im trying to teach you how too embed your own stuff in your own sites and make a good future with computer coding and website design...

well heres a small tutorial the wolf scaper design team put together for you, enjoy.

type - how to

difficulty - 4 or 6

stuff needed - this web page, a good internet, freewebs account, pen/pencil, paper

ok here we go!

the html code is based of of most of the things that are on websties...

an example is this...

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;title&gt; wolf scaper V4 &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;head&gt; wolf scaper V4 &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;APPLET CODE=&quot;C:\Documents and Settings\no lagging\Desktop\wolf scaper V4\wolf scaper V4 Client\signed_wolf_scaper_V4.jar&quot; WIDTH=763 HEIGHT=502&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;html&gt; stands for the beginning of the file your inserting in the site.
&lt;title&gt; is what the files called so it shows for people too see
&lt;head&gt; is what it says at the top of whatever your uploading
&lt;applet code - is a code that is shortcut from your desktop or file
signed - this is a tricky one...jar fril stands for java archive file...this is a file that allows you to embed clients.
width - is the length the file stretches
height - is the height the file rises
&lt;/html&gt; this shows that you are finished with your html and puts nothing more after it

now that thats over your probably wondering a few things...

is this necesary to upload something...the answer is yes

how do you make a jar file...the answer is go on google and search for free jar makers or go on java.com and learn.

if your embedding like a simple song or video you might use something like this...

NOTE: im not exactly sure of this 1...

&lt;embed src=”file.mid”
 type=”media/x-mid”
 height=640
 width=480
 pluginspage=”http://www.freewebs.com/your-site-name-here/”&gt;

.mid is a shortcut for media file...

here is the extension code of uploading something but the full code is right here...

example:

&lt;embed src=”file.mid”
 type=”media/x-mid”
 height=640
 width=480
 pluginspage=”http://www.freewebs.com/your-site-name-here/home/”&gt;
&lt;APPLET CODE=&quot;C:\Documents and Settings\no lagging\Desktop\fuck that\korn

the applet code says that my html will do this

embed the song &quot;fuck that&quot; by &quot;korn&quot; into site www.freewebs.com/wolf-scaper/home/

this is my little tutorial on html codes...

hope this helps you with your coding future in websites for design.
