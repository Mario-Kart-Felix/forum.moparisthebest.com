    <title>Assistance required on item requirments</title>

    <description>To begin I&#39;m running on the Project16v6 source and I&#39;m using the client source released by GalkonsPride and my problem is when i try to equip a dragon 2h sword it states &quot;You Need 60 Defense to equip this&quot; and i figured it was just a miss print so i ignored it got my atk to 60 and tried again but same problem occurred so it does in fact require defense. So I&#39;ve been researching custom items in the hope it would shine some light on this problem but I have yet to find where the item stat requirements lie. To get to the point I&#39;d appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction towards their location or even client or server side would help greatly, I&#39;m not looking for a hand out but rather guidance as I&#39;d like to learn the way of.
