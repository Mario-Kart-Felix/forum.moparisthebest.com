        <p>using software to make games isn’t really good practice, and you don’t get  a whole lot out of it, for you, or your game.  you are limited to what you can and cannot do.  on the plus side, your game may be a bit better than what you could do with a programming language and a graphics library.  the cons outweigh the pros, so i’d suggest (don’t just take it from me, ask anybody) writing simple games with a programming language such as java or c++ with a graphics, sound, and input library of your choice.</p>
<p>here are some <span class="bbcode-i">portable</span> full game development APIs, meaning they handle input, sound, graphics, text, raw rendering, or anything else your game needs.  you can write engines, frameworks, or a simple unreusable pong clone if you wish:</p>
<p>SFML<br>
SDL<br>
Allegro<br>
DirectX</p>
<p>i don’t use java for game development, but if you want to, there’s slick2d and i’ve heard really good things about this.</p>
<p>I believe you can use java with SDL and SFML.  I also believe you can do the same with C#.  Though you can use XNA with c#.</p>

Which one would you recommend me using?[/quote]i didn’t recommend any software.  i recommended a few game-specific libraries.  game maker isn’t a good solution to making games because you are so limited to what you can and can’t do, and what you can and can’t call your own.  pretty much the only thing you say you did, after making a game with game maker, is something design-based, like you made the sprites, or you made the levels with game-maker’s built-in editor, or rather than using drag-and-drop code templates, you wrote the the code yourself.  this may not even be the case, because maybe, you just want to make a game and play it, maybe show your friends, but it won’t get you anywhere into the game development industry.  well, it could, but yoyo games would steal all of your profit, that is, if your game was any good.  i agree that game maker COULD be a good way to start, but only because it somewhat teaches you how everything is put together in a game, though it never shows in-depth game design.</p>
<p>experiment, then throw that bitch back out into the streets.</p>

        <p>Yes I understand that using a game software will probably not allow me to learn much from it but all I am looking for is a software that made like Silkroad or Archlord.

great, you read my post and understand it, so I can see that you are a lot more interested than I thought you were.</p>
<p>Those are APIs specifically made for helping people write games.  If you didn’t use an already-made API, you’d be stuck with reinventing the wheel, even though some companies actually write their own, but only because they are professionals and doing it for a purpose other than it being already there and you don’t want to use it.</p>
<p>SFML is a great way to start for newbies.  It was written in C++, and it is object-oriented.  It is also faster than Allegro, and faster than SDL without the use of OpenGL rendering.  It has a graphics core, a sound core, a system core, and a window core.  Each of these were specifically written to help you write a game, rather than writing these all by yourself, which would literally take years of research and development for a starter.  If you ever decide to use one of those APIs, I’d suggest donating to them for their help.</p>

<p>hopefully you’ll review that website when you are comfortable.</p>

        <p>I really appreciate your help. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
I am definitely going to take some classes on this stuff in college later on in my life to actually code one from scratch but for now this will do.<br>
I already sent them about $20 for the great software as this should suit my needs. If I could REP++ you I would but seeing as I have 11 I cannot <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>

        <p>[quote=“JustChillBro, post:6, topic:426288”]Yes I understand that using a game software will probably not allow me to learn much from it but all I am looking for is a software that made like Silkroad or Archlord. Something like that. I just want to make a starter game and upgrade from that to make it even better in time with the knowledge I learn then.<br>
Also,<br>
SFML<br>
SDL<br>

What are those?[/quote]Forget Silkroad/Archlord, thinking you’re able to make one of those with your friend is enough to just give up and go back to playing soccer.</p>

        <p>Lol alright well flame/troll are on the same thing. I stated I wanted a program that could help me create a game LIKE archlord/silkroad. Never once did I say I was going to make one like it right away. If you could read I said, “I just want to make a starter game and upgrade from that to make it even better in time with the knowledge I learn then.” meaning the game I am creating will be no where near like Silkroad or Archlord so you need to learn to read before posting. The reason I haven’t posted any pics is because I am not going to waste my time with showing my game to pathetic kids like you who probably wont ever create a game in your life. Noticing by what lemme_winks_ said, hes a way better C++ coder then any of you. Just because you kids have 200 REP doesn’t mean you know it all about coding cause believe me you guys are far from knowing anything about C++. You may be asking (who am I to judge what you guys know) and I can tell just because of how stupid you guys really are.<br>
My friend is out of college and took classes for C++ coding and more. He knows way more then I do about it and he is teaching me and believe it or not I’m only in High School as a JR and plan on taking some sort of class on this next year or this year depending on how my courses look for next semester. BTW doing the graphics of a game like that doesn’t take “months” seeing as I talked with one of the developers for archlord and it only took them about 2 weeks for the graphics so it shows how stupid you really are. I’m aware of the costs lol as I have plenty of money but as I said we are far from creating any type of game like archlord but I assure you after high school/college we will have a team/community going for the game.<br>
You may think we are going to fail but tbh you can say whatever you want but it wont make a difference considering you probably haven’t even tried coding C++ or even a game so why talk shit lmfao.<br>
Lol everyone will fail a life somehow as no one is perfect but I will successfully create my game and make it more popular then silkroad or archlord.<br>

He said that because it looks like you know more about programming them everyone else (because what you said was actually good advice, compared to the other guy).</p>

<p>I’ll just post this link here in case <a href="http://gamedev.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,513298.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">mr “I’m gonna maek teh next call of duty”</a> forgot.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/the.html">@the</a> op.</p>
<p>I was going to be nice, and still will. Yes, I could accuse you of being a troll and I could have missed some form of inside joke. But I’ll take Poe’s law in consideration and just say STFU.<br>
You asked a question, the people here answered, you didn’t like the answer, you started flaming the very people you trusted enough to ask. Notice the problem?</p>
<p>I’ll be blunt since I’ve seen this question so many times on other boards.<br>
I’ll base it on the fact that you have no programming experience. You are welcome to correct me if I’m wrong.</p>
<p>YOU DO NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE A MMO, FORGET IT</p>
<p>YOU DO NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE A MMO, FORGET IT</p>
<p>YOU DO NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE A MMO, FORGET IT</p>
<p>So. Now when it’s out in the air.</p>
<p>I lack the elitism of the other posters and finds nothing wrong in “Game Developer Software”. They are great if you just want to make a semi-complex game (I’ve used both). Lot of indie-devs use them. Daniel Remar’s IJI was made in Game maker. All of Kaktus’ games are made in Game Maker/Construct. I think Cave Story was made in Game Maker.</p>
<p>Both Game Maker and Construct does have onlinesupport.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>You will NOT be able to make a MMO in them. You just won’t.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">So. You want the right direction for MMO-city?</span><br>
Game Maker/Construct is decent for beginners. You will at least learn some Game Logic and they have built in support for GML/Python so they will introduce you to some basic programming in an enviroment where things actually will happen on the screen.</p>
<p>The alternative is to just learn programming directly. Someone recomended C/C++. I do not. My university started with Java (with Slick2D or just LWJGL for gamedevelopment. But Haskell is a decent choice too (it’s not really game friendly though). Action Script 3 is a good starting point with the right library (Flixel or FlashPunk), but you won’t be able to do a non-farmville-like MMO with it. I’ve never touched Unity so I’m going to say:</p>
<p>Start with C# and XNA. It has decent performance, good documentation, an active community, and some good tutorials from Microsoft™. Visual Studio Express was free last time i checked, so thats a plus.</p>
<p>Just remember:<br>
You will make shitty games for a lot of years. I started with C++ for like 7-10 years ago (I’ve never been dedicated/serious enough to do anything though) and I still make shitty games. Don’t start making your dream game. Make a lot of clones of simple games. Start with pong, go to snake, then breakout, Luna Lander, tetris, Super Mario etc.</p>
<p>I repeat. Your first games will suck without doubt, there is no point in wasting a good idea in a bad game.</p>
<p>And thats just the programming bit, then there is math…</p>
<p>You’ll need lot of math för a 3D game (you will do fine with some basic trigonometry for basic 2D).</p>
<p>Good Luck and Have fun. Don’t get disencouraged by the harsh words. Use it as a reality check and set up realistic goals.</p>
<p>Edit: I’ll not even talk about networking. It’s a field of voodoo and black magic. Half of the practitioners turns insane and the other half are child eating-atheist-muslim-terrorist-communist mexicans. True story.</p>
