You asked a question, the people here answered, you didn’t like the answer, you started flaming the very people you trusted enough to ask. Notice the problem?</p>
<p>I’ll be blunt since I’ve seen this question so many times on other boards.<br>
I’ll base it on the fact that you have no programming experience. You are welcome to correct me if I’m wrong.</p>
<p>YOU DO NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE A MMO, FORGET IT</p>
<p>YOU DO NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE A MMO, FORGET IT</p>
<p>YOU DO NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE A MMO, FORGET IT</p>
<p>So. Now when it’s out in the air.</p>
<p>I lack the elitism of the other posters and finds nothing wrong in “Game Developer Software”. They are great if you just want to make a semi-complex game (I’ve used both). Lot of indie-devs use them. Daniel Remar’s IJI was made in Game maker. All of Kaktus’ games are made in Game Maker/Construct. I think Cave Story was made in Game Maker.</p>
<p>Both Game Maker and Construct does have onlinesupport.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>You will NOT be able to make a MMO in them. You just won’t.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">So. You want the right direction for MMO-city?</span><br>
Game Maker/Construct is decent for beginners. You will at least learn some Game Logic and they have built in support for GML/Python so they will introduce you to some basic programming in an enviroment where things actually will happen on the screen.</p>
<p>The alternative is to just learn programming directly. Someone recomended C/C++. I do not. My university started with Java (with Slick2D or just LWJGL for gamedevelopment. But Haskell is a decent choice too (it’s not really game friendly though). Action Script 3 is a good starting point with the right library (Flixel or FlashPunk), but you won’t be able to do a non-farmville-like MMO with it. I’ve never touched Unity so I’m going to say:</p>
<p>Start with C# and XNA. It has decent performance, good documentation, an active community, and some good tutorials from Microsoft™. Visual Studio Express was free last time i checked, so thats a plus.</p>
<p>Just remember:<br>
You will make shitty games for a lot of years. I started with C++ for like 7-10 years ago (I’ve never been dedicated/serious enough to do anything though) and I still make shitty games. Don’t start making your dream game. Make a lot of clones of simple games. Start with pong, go to snake, then breakout, Luna Lander, tetris, Super Mario etc.</p>
<p>I repeat. Your first games will suck without doubt, there is no point in wasting a good idea in a bad game.</p>
<p>And thats just the programming bit, then there is math…</p>
<p>You’ll need lot of math för a 3D game (you will do fine with some basic trigonometry for basic 2D).</p>
<p>Good Luck and Have fun. Don’t get disencouraged by the harsh words. Use it as a reality check and set up realistic goals.</p>
<p>Edit: I’ll not even talk about networking. It’s a field of voodoo and black magic. Half of the practitioners turns insane and the other half are child eating-atheist-muslim-terrorist-communist mexicans. True story.[/quote]I’m not going to read all of that but what I said in my OP was:</p>
<p>I have 2 years time to complete this engine because of the fact that 2 years is what is left for me to go to DAE (Digital Arts and Entertainment). This engine will become very handy in the future.</p>
<p>I will also probably assemble a team together for when the engine is completed, and make the next Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Meaning that, in the future, when I’m actually studying real game development, and the engine is completed, and I have a professional game development team, I’ll make a game like Call of Duty.</p>

        <p>there’s always engines ready to go with 3D-supporting game engines like unreal engine and unity engine.  hell, there’s tons more, even with networking APIs and all that shit built in with it, but you have to learn how to use them, how they were layed out, and what everything does.  unreal editor is really cool.  borderlands was made with unreal engine and that game is bad fuckin’ ass.</p>
<p>ps: you still have to be able to program.  i think unreal engine uses unreal script, c, and c++.  correct me if i am wrong.  for networking, there are a ton of game-specific networking APIs out there.  raknet and it’s fucking sick: <a href="http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/</a></p>

<p>+1 unless its baby stuff like using scratch(free software used to teach programming at an early age) to make a simple game.

<p>Scratch can build fundamentals in programming. Yes, it is simple, we know that. But nonetheless it can teach the flow of general programming to middle and high schoolers.</p>
