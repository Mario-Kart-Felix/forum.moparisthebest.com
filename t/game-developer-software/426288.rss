    <description>What software would I need to get to make a &quot;arcade&quot; game sorta like Minesweeper but not exactly like that. My friend and I are wanting to make one just to see how it would start out.</description>

+1 unless its baby stuff like using scratch(free software used to teach programming at an early age) to make a simple game.

<p>Scratch can build fundamentals in programming. Yes, it is simple, we know that. But nonetheless it can teach the flow of general programming to middle and high schoolers.</p>

              <p>there’s always engines ready to go with 3D-supporting game engines like unreal engine and unity engine.  hell, there’s tons more, even with networking APIs and all that shit built in with it, but you have to learn how to use them, how they were layed out, and what everything does.  unreal editor is really cool.  borderlands was made with unreal engine and that game is bad fuckin’ ass.</p>
<p>ps: you still have to be able to program.  i think unreal engine uses unreal script, c, and c++.  correct me if i am wrong.  for networking, there are a ton of game-specific networking APIs out there.  raknet and it’s fucking sick: <a href="http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/</a></p>

<p>I lack the elitism of the other posters and finds nothing wrong in “Game Developer Software”. They are great if you just want to make a semi-complex game (I’ve used both).

<p>You will NOT be able to make a MMO in them. You just won’t.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">So. You want the right direction for MMO-city?</span><br>
Game Maker/Construct is decent for beginners. You will at least learn some Game Logic and they have built in support for GML/Python so they will introduce you to some basic programming in an enviroment where things actually will happen on the screen.</p>
<p>The alternative is to just learn programming directly. Someone recomended C/C++. I do not. My university started with Java (with Slick2D or just LWJGL for gamedevelopment.

Action Script 3 is a good starting point with the right library (Flixel or FlashPunk), but you won’t be able to do a non-farmville-like MMO with it. I’ve never touched Unity so I’m going to say:</p>
<p>Start with C# and XNA. It has decent performance, good documentation, an active community, and some good tutorials from Microsoft™. Visual Studio Express was free last time i checked, so thats a plus.</p>
<p>Just remember:<br>
You will make shitty games for a lot of years. I started with C++ for like 7-10 years ago (I’ve never been dedicated/serious enough to do anything though) and I still make shitty games. Don’t start making your dream game. Make a lot of clones of simple games. Start with pong, go to snake, then breakout, Luna Lander, tetris, Super Mario etc.</p>
<p>I repeat. Your first games will suck without doubt, there is no point in wasting a good idea in a bad game.</p>
<p>And thats just the programming bit, then there is math…</p>
<p>You’ll need lot of math för a 3D game (you will do fine with some basic trigonometry for basic 2D).</p>
<p>Good Luck and Have fun. Don’t get disencouraged by the harsh words. Use it as a reality check and set up realistic goals.</p>
<p>Edit: I’ll not even talk about networking. It’s a field of voodoo and black magic. Half of the practitioners turns insane and the other half are child eating-atheist-muslim-terrorist-communist mexicans. True story.[/quote]I’m not going to read all of that but what I said in my OP was:</p>
<p>I have 2 years time to complete this engine because of the fact that 2 years is what is left for me to go to DAE (Digital Arts and Entertainment). This engine will become very handy in the future.</p>
<p>I will also probably assemble a team together for when the engine is completed, and make the next Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Meaning that, in the future, when I’m actually studying real game development, and the engine is completed, and I have a professional game development team, I’ll make a game like Call of Duty.</p>

              <p>Lol alright well flame/troll are on the same thing. I stated I wanted a program that could help me create a game LIKE archlord/silkroad. Never once did I say I was going to make one like it right away. If you could read I said, “I just want to make a starter game and upgrade from that to make it even better in time with the knowledge I learn then.” meaning the game I am creating will be no where near like Silkroad or Archlord so you need to learn to read before posting. The reason I haven’t posted any pics is because I am not going to waste my time with showing my game to pathetic kids like you who probably wont ever create a game in your life. Noticing by what lemme_winks_ said, hes a way better C++ coder then any of you. Just because you kids have 200 REP doesn’t mean you know it all about coding cause believe me you guys are far from knowing anything about C++. You may be asking (who am I to judge what you guys know) and I can tell just because of how stupid you guys really are.<br>
My friend is out of college and took classes for C++ coding and more. He knows way more then I do about it and he is teaching me and believe it or not I’m only in High School as a JR and plan on taking some sort of class on this next year or this year depending on how my courses look for next semester. BTW doing the graphics of a game like that doesn’t take “months” seeing as I talked with one of the developers for archlord and it only took them about 2 weeks for the graphics so it shows how stupid you really are. I’m aware of the costs lol as I have plenty of money but as I said we are far from creating any type of game like archlord but I assure you after high school/college we will have a team/community going for the game.<br>
You may think we are going to fail but tbh you can say whatever you want but it wont make a difference considering you probably haven’t even tried coding C++ or even a game so why talk shit lmfao.<br>
Lol everyone will fail a life somehow as no one is perfect but I will successfully create my game and make it more popular then silkroad or archlord.<br>
KID.</p>

great, you read my post and understand it, so I can see that you are a lot more interested than I thought you were.</p>
<p>Those are APIs specifically made for helping people write games.  If you didn’t use an already-made API, you’d be stuck with reinventing the wheel, even though some companies actually write their own, but only because they are professionals and doing it for a purpose other than it being already there and you don’t want to use it.</p>
<p>SFML is a great way to start for newbies.  It was written in C++, and it is object-oriented.  It is also faster than Allegro, and faster than SDL without the use of OpenGL rendering.  It has a graphics core, a sound core, a system core, and a window core.  Each of these were specifically written to help you write a game, rather than writing these all by yourself, which would literally take years of research and development for a starter.  If you ever decide to use one of those APIs, I’d suggest donating to them for their help.</p>
<p>for more in-depth information: <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.sfml-dev.org/</a></p>
<p>hopefully you’ll review that website when you are comfortable.</p>

<p>experiment, then throw that bitch back out into the streets.</p>

              <p>using software to make games isn’t really good practice, and you don’t get  a whole lot out of it, for you, or your game.  you are limited to what you can and cannot do.  on the plus side, your game may be a bit better than what you could do with a programming language and a graphics library.  the cons outweigh the pros, so i’d suggest (don’t just take it from me, ask anybody) writing simple games with a programming language such as java or c++ with a graphics, sound, and input library of your choice.</p>
<p>here are some <span class="bbcode-i">portable</span> full game development APIs, meaning they handle input, sound, graphics, text, raw rendering, or anything else your game needs.  you can write engines, frameworks, or a simple unreusable pong clone if you wish:</p>
<p>SFML<br>
SDL<br>
Allegro<br>
DirectX</p>
<p>i don’t use java for game development, but if you want to, there’s slick2d and i’ve heard really good things about this.</p>
<p>I believe you can use java with SDL and SFML.  I also believe you can do the same with C#.  Though you can use XNA with c#.</p>
