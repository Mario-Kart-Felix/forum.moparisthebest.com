<p>No idea, I always thought I ate alot. First I wake up and have no appetite until noon, and then if I eat too much I just feel uncomfortable. I try and just eat alot of crap throughout the day but mostly stuff with protein in it.</p>
<p>I wish there was something with a small serving size that had tons of calories in it that was still relatively healthy</p>

How does one even consume that little? Pretty sure I eat more than 1500 calories in 1 meal haha<br>
[/quote]<br>
No idea, I always thought I ate alot. First I wake up and have no appetite until noon, and then if I eat too much I just feel uncomfortable. I try and just eat alot of crap throughout the day but mostly stuff with protein in it.</p>
<p>I wish there was something with a small serving size that had tons of calories in it that was still relatively healthy[/quote]<br>
Yeah I don’t have any appetite until noon either, but that’s because I follow an IF eating pattern. dat der ghrelin hormone.</p>

<p>What’s the point in doing it with dumbells when you have a spotter? First he is taking some of the weight away, second he is balancing for you which you should really do yourself since it’s one of the main reasons to even do dumbell press. The video shows clearly that without the spotter heavily helping you balance you got major wiggle-wiggle-wiggle in your shoulders and without him you would probably damage yourself. So lower your weights and do it properly. If you just want to train your strength to press forward then use a barbell or even a chest machine.</p>
<p>Frell, took some prohormones or what? You got some chest acne there. Although I can imagine serious diet changes do it as well.</p>

<p>Yeah, I figured the same thing…</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not mad at all. If you want to fudge around with flat bench and boast that you’re pushing up 90lb (although you’re not really) on dumbbells be my guest. But I’ve studied enough sport science to know that a) your technique is bad b) you’re making the point of using dumbbells redundant c) why would you boast about how much weight you’re doing on dumbbells in the first place. Unless you’re strength training (in which case I’d recommend a bench press), technique + dumbbells and TUT (time under tension) should be your goal when using dumbbells.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Not only are you wrong about the form, but reading your entire post was astoundingly painful.<br>
All I can say to such a horrendous post, is that you clearly need to go back to misc.[/quote]<br>
Since you seem to want to go the whole 12 rounds with me on this, let’s do it. I’ll play along with Tubby’s ruling, seems fair.</p>
<p>I was only taking a little jab at you for posting videos/photos/etc, didn’t mean to get you so worked up but in my experience those that do post the videos/photos, either a) are not worth watching b) make me cringe. Unless ofcourse, your name is Martin Berkhan and you can deadlift almost 4x your weight.</p>
<p>Your form; touching dumbbells at the top of a flat press puts a lot of stress on your shoulder/elbow joint. Not that 90lb is a weight at which will cause too much problems straight away, but overtime you can injure your shoulders. It weakens the shoulder joint.<br>
Locking the arms out on any form of press takes the force of the movement away from your muscle and puts it entirely on the joint. Best I can describe it as is this, seeing as you seem fairly tuned on in terms of weight lifting. Next time you’re at your gym, anywhere will suffice actually, perform a shoulder width overhand chin up. Now, let yourself drop down, letting your arms lock out. Feel that jerking motion/pulling feeling on your wrist? That’s the force of your weight transferring through your wrist joint. The only difference in this situation is there is your entire body weight + gravity transferring through it, not just 90lb.</p>
<p>Dumbbells are best for inducing hypertrophy which is desired when building muscle. They aren’t the best for raw strength (in this case anyway). As far back as you can remember the best exercise for building upperbody pressing power is, and always will be, the bench press. Dumbbell benching is good for hypertrophy, bench pressing is good for strength - DON’T confuse the two.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re trying to induce hypertrophy which I am going to assume you are, there are better ways to perform a dumbbell bench than the “flat bench” you performed. That exercise has a bad habit of producing “man boobs” so to speak. Ofcourse I am only merely speculating at this point because I have no idea what you train for/want to achieve. If it’s too feel better about yourself because you moved some weight and posted a video than kudos too you. But, there’s a reason why bodybuilders do not perform the flat bench.</p>
<p>Not that I can clearly see in your video, but it looks like on 2 or 3 of your reps your scapulars protracted. This either tells me the weight is too high, or you have poor scapular retraction. However, take this with a grain of salt because I can’t really tell without watching your form from the side.</p>
<p>ps I’d like it known I don’t advocate for either bench or dumbbell press. They just both have their uses, but only doing one of the two is not wise either. Incorporate both, but focus primarily around your goal.</p>

Aaand I took this today.<br>
Gains :3</p>
<p>90lb dumbbells while doing ‘lying wide dumbbell bench’. Feels gud/accomplished.<br>
Previous max was 80lbs for like 5 reps, didn’t even have a spotter.</p>
<p>And interestingly enough, some videos/pictures don’t even load for me on this site, so here’s a link!<br>

<p>What’s the point in doing it with dumbells when you have a spotter? First he is taking some of the weight away, second he is balancing for you which you should really do yourself since it’s one of the main reasons to even do dumbell press. The video shows clearly that without the spotter heavily helping you balance you got major wiggle-wiggle-wiggle in your shoulders and without him you would probably damage yourself. So lower your weights and do it properly. If you just want to train your strength to press forward then use a barbell or even a chest machine.</p>
<p>Frell, took some prohormones or what? You got some chest acne there. Although I can imagine serious diet changes do it as well.[/quote]</p>
<p>The ‘wiggling’ was due to me trying to move his hands away as they were in the way of mine and ruining my balance.<br>
“spotter heavily helping you”<br>
“taking away some of the weight”</p>
<p>Not only do I do 80’s without spotters or anyone oh so heavily assisting me and “balancing” me, but the only reason I even bothered to get someone to spot me was because I still wasn’t confident enough in my 20lb raise. At high weight, I’m not just going to quickly adjust into proper position (referring to your balancing statement), it requires a bit more time which is what I was heading towards until he decided to assist on that.</p>
<p>To even suggest using a machine is poor advice. I suggest that you check out Elliot Hulse’s videos on as to why.</p>

<p>I’m not mad at all. If you want to fudge around with flat bench and boast that you’re pushing up 90lb (although you’re not really) on dumbbells be my guest. But I’ve studied enough sport science to know that a) your technique is bad b) you’re making the point of using dumbbells redundant c) why would you boast about how much weight you’re doing on dumbbells in the first place. Unless you’re strength training (in which case I’d recommend a bench press), technique + dumbbells and TUT (time under tension) should be your goal when using dumbbells.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not only are you wrong about the form, but reading your entire post was astoundingly painful.<br>
All I can say to such a horrendous post, is that you clearly need to go back to misc.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Since you seem to want to go the whole 12 rounds with me on this, let’s do it. I’ll play along with Tubby’s ruling, seems fair.</p>
<p>I was only taking a little jab at you for posting videos/photos/etc, didn’t mean to get you so worked up but in my experience those that do post the videos/photos, either a) are not worth watching b) make me cringe. Unless ofcourse, your name is Martin Berkhan and you can deadlift almost 4x your weight.</p>
<p>Your form; touching dumbbells at the top of a flat press puts a lot of stress on your shoulder/elbow joint. Not that 90lb is a weight at which will cause too much problems straight away, but overtime you can injure your shoulders. It weakens the shoulder joint.<br>
Locking the arms out on any form of press takes the force of the movement away from your muscle and puts it entirely on the joint. Best I can describe it as is this, seeing as you seem fairly tuned on in terms of weight lifting. Next time you’re at your gym, anywhere will suffice actually, perform a shoulder width overhand chin up. Now, let yourself drop down, letting your arms lock out. Feel that jerking motion/pulling feeling on your wrist? That’s the force of your weight transferring through your wrist joint. The only difference in this situation is there is your entire body weight + gravity transferring through it, not just 90lb.</p>
<p>Dumbbells are best for inducing hypertrophy which is desired when building muscle. They aren’t the best for raw strength (in this case anyway). As far back as you can remember the best exercise for building upperbody pressing power is, and always will be, the bench press. Dumbbell benching is good for hypertrophy, bench pressing is good for strength - DON’T confuse the two.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re trying to induce hypertrophy which I am going to assume you are, there are better ways to perform a dumbbell bench than the “flat bench” you performed. That exercise has a bad habit of producing “man boobs” so to speak. Ofcourse I am only merely speculating at this point because I have no idea what you train for/want to achieve. If it’s too feel better about yourself because you moved some weight and posted a video than kudos too you. But, there’s a reason why bodybuilders do not perform the flat bench.</p>
<p>Not that I can clearly see in your video, but it looks like on 2 or 3 of your reps your scapulars protracted. This either tells me the weight is too high, or you have poor scapular retraction. However, take this with a grain of salt because I can’t really tell without watching your form from the side.</p>
<p>ps I’d like it known I don’t advocate for either bench or dumbbell press. They just both have their uses, but only doing one of the two is not wise either. Incorporate both, but focus primarily around your goal.[/quote]</p>
<p>Videos/pictures in a fitness thread seemed rather… normal.<br>
It was neither done to show off nor encourage others or anything of the sort. It made me happy &amp; proud, so I shared it with the people here.</p>
<p>My arms didn’t actually lock out, but this is difficult to see due to my hoodie and angle of the camera. I entirely agree with your point on this.</p>
<p>As for the reasoning behind my decision for dumbbells in this video, they are a personal favorite, one which I started with, so albeit it’s a priority, bench press is involved two days after.<br>
They’re definitely not excluded.</p>
<p>I’ve only ever maxed on bench press once and that was at 205x2, no spotter.<br>
I do 185 for reps.</p>
<p>As a mesomorph, I stopped caring about raw strength a decent while ago.<br>
I’m sure you can understand why, considering your knowledge.</p>
<p>I already have man boobs <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
You can grab a handful if you’d like.<br>
…maybe even two.</p>
<p>As for my scapula regions, I’d have to agree with your comment about viewing it from the side without me wearing a hoodie, rather than the video.<br>
But your input relating to such is duly noted.</p>
<p>I certainly incorporate both, but the video itself was my first achievement relating to the dumbbell bench.<br>
I of course do bench press as well. Avoiding one of the three of holy lifter regiments would be sin.</p>
<p>Regardless of our views on this, you have gained my respect.<br>
[size=0.7em][sub]and boob touching privileges[/sub][/size]</p>
<p>Anyways, if you have anymore comments, I’ll be back in several hours to discuss them with you.</p>
