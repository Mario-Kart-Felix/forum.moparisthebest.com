    <description>Hi Everyone - Long time no uhh post. :)

It would be really helpful if someone could do this small essay for me.

[b]Introduction[/b]: Give the name of the text and author. Give the name of the character and state the focus of the essay.

[b]Main Body[/b]: This section of the essay is diveded into paragraphs and you should include referene to the text and suitable quotations. (Each bullet point idicates a different paragraph)

[b]Aspects to consider[/b]: 

[ul][li]What benvolio says about Romeo at the beginning about his behaviour. What romeo says to benvolio to explain his behaviour. The language Romeo uses.[/li]
[li]Describe the meeting between Romeo and Juliet at the Capulet Ball. What imagery does Romeo use to describe Juliet and how is this different from how benvolio described him in the first scene? What does this tell you about him?[/li]
