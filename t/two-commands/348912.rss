    <title>Two commands</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/two-commands/348912</link>
    <description>Well, there is a server that had two commands that I have no clue how to add, but need to add them. Once was ::ninja, it made it so you go completely invisible. Not on the minimap, can&#39;t hover their mouse over you, but you are still there and can see everything, another was ::tapon. It made it so you could view a players clicks, screen movements, and what they typed, PM and public chat. It was basically something that showed you their game screen. Anyone wanna help me on how to add these? Pretty advanced stuff.</description>
