<p>Owner Skate, are you sure that you put the cache somewhere that you know of and you set the directory towards the place you put it? Make sure that it’s not moving around by it’s self. I used to play a 508 that I owned but I’m not that advanced in coding yet, all I did was make sure the crap inside of the run was all correct.</p>
