              <p>Well, you’ll need to set your paths (assuming you haven’t…) so you would need to go to environment variables and set:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin</p>
<p>As path, only with your version of JDK in the top box. Then under that add:</p>
<p>CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin</p>
<p>In the box below and set that as your classpath.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if that will fix it… But I’m just throwing it out.</p>
