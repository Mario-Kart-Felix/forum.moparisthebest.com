    <description>Hey there.
My name is Anders, and i have a few questions. :)
First up, i have downloaded moparscape.. yes. I can look at my skills and take off my pickaxe, and mine the ore i am facing.  But. when i try to move, i always frezes, and the program gets shut down. I have heard so much cool about it, and it looks cool!(for SURE!)

And another thing. i see you are making models.. pretty sweet! 
I dont know anything about making a sword, or adding it to the game. i cant even play the game.

So i am really happy to see this forum, looks so cool! All, thank you.
