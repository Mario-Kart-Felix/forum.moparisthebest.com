    <description>What&#39;s your thoughts on multiple characters per website/forum account?

Originally it seemed like a good idea being able to share your bank account but I see it as a big complication now. For example, if a user signs up with the username &#39;Luke&#39; and manages to register the website name but the in-game character name is already taken, they don&#39;t read the error message and see that they&#39;re logged into the website as &#39;Luke&#39;. When they try to login in-game and get an invalid login it&#39;s confusing. They then go back to the account management page and change the password only to go through the same thing again.

I&#39;ve tried to make it as clear as I possibly can but still it confuses new players not used to the system so on our new server we&#39;re going to have just one account. If you want another in-game character you will have to register another website account. I think this makes a lot more sense but I also think not being able to share bank accounts will be a huge turn off to a lot of players.

What&#39;s your thoughts?

I&#39;m opting for just a &#39;user&#39; table that uses the same username in-game as it does on the website/forum. Its one table. No complications having to remember multiple passwords or whatever. No worries of banning one character only for them to create another on the same website account to retrieve their items from the bank, etc.

Both methods have their pros and cons but what would you opt for?</description>

              <p>I like Object’s idea. Forum registered account also registers a player account. Let them add additional players to their forum account but their “main” remains as their forum account.</p>
<p>Since you are sticking avatars as their players, why not let them show a list of their players and selection which one (default being their main) for the avatar display. Then put a little info under their avatar that displays beside each of their forum posts stating that selected player’s name and combat level with a link to see it in the high scores.</p>

              <p>You could always add a check for any type of account creation. If you create an in-game account or character, make sure noone uses the same name as a forum account. If you create a forum account, make sure noone uses the same name as an in-game account or character.</p>
<p>In addition to this, provide two types of account creation. One that allows a new user to create an in-game account or character (without being logged in to any forum account). Their forum account could be created automatically for them in the process. The other I believe you already have. The one where you create a forum account and automatically have the in-game account or character by that name created (or atleast reserved for later creation).</p>
<p>But if you’re trying to create an exact replica of RSC (or as exact as you possibly can), then why not go with the same account management system as they have aswell?</p>

              <p>Not really sure what to do honestly. I really don’t like the whole ‘forum account connecting your characters’ concept. You should just make it completely optional to create a forum account and have a entirely new character creation page so it’s easier for new and old players.</p>
<p>Possibly make it so if you do choose to register a forum account, you could LINK your in-game character with it. Though i’m not entirely sure on how to handle the whole ‘sharing banks’ thing.</p>
