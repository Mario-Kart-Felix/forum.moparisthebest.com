    <title>Restoring Your Character Appearance 562</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/restoring-your-character-appearance-562/507896</link>
    <description>On every server there is a command which is something like ::npcme &lt;id&gt;
it changes your character to a certain npc, on my server you&#39;d type ::npcme 50 to become king black dragon.

After typing that, there is no way to change back so I want to make a command which will work for everyone who wants to switch back so i started it off but i need help: 

[code]
	if(cmd[0].equals(&quot;restoreme&quot;)) {
		player.getActionSender().asNPC = false;
		player.set().npcId = &#39;-1&#39;
		player.set().gender = 1
	
	}
[/code]
I am 100% sure that what i type above is incorrect. Can someone help me with this? What i want it to do is, i want it to go into the players XML file and set the &quot;npcId&quot; to -1 and gender to     1 and the &quot;asNPC&quot;.

Thanks for the help.</description>

<p>When i posted this, no i didn’t. But now that you mention it, I just did. I got a few errors but fixed them, so i changed the code to this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        if(cmd[0].equals("restoreme")) {
                player.getActionSender().asNPC = false;
                player.set().npcId = "-1";
                player.set().gender = 1;
        
        }</code></pre>
<p>Its not a big change just added the “;”. However, I get this compiler error now:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">src\com\rs2hd\packethandler\CommandPacketHandler.java:56: error: cannot find sym
bol
                player.getActionSender().asNPC = false;
                                        ^
  symbol:   variable asNPC
  location: class ActionSender
src\com\rs2hd\packethandler\CommandPacketHandler.java:57: error: cannot find sym
bol
                player.set().npcId = "-1";
                      ^
  symbol:   method set()
  location: variable player of type Player
src\com\rs2hd\packethandler\CommandPacketHandler.java:58: error: cannot find sym
bol
                player.set().gender = 1;
                      ^
  symbol:   method set()
  location: variable player of type Player</code></pre>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>
