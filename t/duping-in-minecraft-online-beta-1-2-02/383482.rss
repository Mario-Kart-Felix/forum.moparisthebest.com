    <description>For mods. is this allowed to post? :D

Warning. This is banable.

Welcome to my guide on how to dupe in minecraft. Offline and Online. (tested in the newest version beta 1.2_02)

Get your items in your invertory you want do dupe.
[IMG]http://i51.tinypic.com/15chrir.jpg[/img]

After that you search or place somewhere lava. If you find it or placed it make a chest next to it and type (This work on almost all servers) /sethome. This means that you can do /home and tele next to your lava spot and your chest.
If the server dont support a /home make sure you place your lava and your chest near your spawn spot. Or you can just run back to the place you died, But it takes alot of longer.

Next : You jump into the lava. Make sure you come out quikly. so you burn to dead.
When you are burning to dead open your chest and wait till u die.
If you see you died place your items that are still in the inventory in the chest. 

Now hit escape so you get out of the chest interface and click on respawn.
Come back to it. (/home or walk)
Then you notice that your stuff what you just lost by dieing is on the ground. Pick it up.
After that open your chest. And the (duped stuff) you just placed in chest is still there!

Duped in less then 5min.
You can do this over and over till you have enough :)

How did i found this dupe (Yes i found it!).
I was tired and exedently walked into my lava pool cuz i was thinking while holding &quot;s&quot; (With s you walk backwards)
I felt into my lava pool. Climbed out and did /home. I was in panic cuz i had few diamands so i wanted to place all in chest but i had alot in my inverory so i could place all before i died. When i died with chest interface open, I saw that the stuff was on the ground and also in my chest.
I was thinking wtf. people saw it. people report. I was banned :(

Enjoy duping. Notch will fix this soon i gues (not to hard)
Please i know duping aint cool. I dont need hater commands... xD
