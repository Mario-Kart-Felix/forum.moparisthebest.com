    <title>Parking and job permits?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/parking-and-job-permits/326177</link>
    <description>Okay, so my last quarter I didn&#39;t do so well. Honestly, I didn&#39;t do so well this quarter either, but I have all passing grades. But, I&#39;m in a bit of a situation that I think might happen when I go back.

You see, at my school, if you don&#39;t have a passing grade by the end of the quarter (above a 59%) you get your job and parking permit taken away. I&#39;m sure many schools do this, which is why I&#39;m asking you this question. I had a 59% in my pre-calculus class, mind you I put no effort into it, and got my parking and job permit taken away last quarter. This quarter, I managed to get a 67%. I know, it&#39;s not much better, but hey at least I passed. The thing I&#39;m worried about is that if I failed for the semester, will they take that into account for my permits?

I might have failed for the semester, due to mid-terms being 15% of my semester grade. I&#39;m worried that they will take the semester grade into account, even though they normally take the quarters. Does anyone know for sure?</description>

It’s honestly a load of shit what they do. A friend of mine got into a fight and someone recorded a video of it. Well, The principle lied a said he had the tape and called everyone down to the office that he thought was in the video and told them to sign a slip saying that they were in it. Everyone believed that he had the tape, so we all signed it and were potentially facing a charge on our records for disorderly conduct. My friend, on the other hand, got expelled for the first semester. All this happened before he even got a hold of the tape.</p>

Okay, so my last quarter I didn’t do so well. Honestly, I didn’t do so well this quarter either, but I have all passing grades. But, I’m in a bit of a situation that I think might happen when I go back.</p>
<p>You see, at my school, if you don’t have a passing grade by the end of the quarter (above a 59%) you get your job and parking permit taken away. I’m sure many schools do this, which is why I’m asking you this question. I had a 59% in my pre-calculus class, mind you I put no effort into it, and got my parking and job permit taken away last quarter. This quarter, I managed to get a 67%. I know, it’s not much better, but hey at least I passed. The thing I’m worried about is that if I failed for the semester, will they take that into account for my permits?</p>
<p>I might have failed for the semester, due to mid-terms being 15% of my semester grade. I’m worried that they will take the semester grade into account, even though they normally take the quarters. Does anyone know for sure?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You didn’t fail the semester you need a 59, 59 to pass with an even 59. You got a 59, 67 which means your average will be like a 63 meaning you would pass the semester unless they use your mid-terms also, but if your school does it like my school it will look like this; Q1+Q1+Q2+Q2+M=???/5= Final grade. As long as you got a 60+ on your mid-term you pass for the semester anything lower and you will most likely fail…[/quote]I scored just high enough to get a 60% haha.</p>
