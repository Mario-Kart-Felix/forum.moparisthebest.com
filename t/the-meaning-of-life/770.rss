              <p>I think there is a meaning to life. Even hobos or bums have some purpose and even though it isn’t a big purpose it still is one. Everything we do effects the world. Also, to those who say that science is better then religion. What do you expect God to do in order for you to believe in him? Just fucking tapdance in front of your faces and fly away into the sky?

<p>the meaning of life is to live… subconciously working out the meaning of life, then when you die… you get told if you were right or wrong… if your right… you start another good life (memory wiped, regianed when you die, and wiped again when you start another life) if your wrong… you start a bad life ( memory wiped, regianed when you die, and wiped again when you start another life) .  You can take breaks in between to let your soul rest … there is no time in the breaks… and you can come back anywhere in… this thing we live in… like what ever the universe is in… and whatever thats in… and so on… i own! good life for me when i die :D[/quote]  I don’t appreciate, at all, the way you have intolerantly called heaven “gay.”  This is a debate forum, please at least try to seem as upright and educated as possible.  It’s a good way to flamed, the way you’re going about.  Back to the subject… According to SCIENCE humans have been around for that many years, if you’re number is even remotely correct, and people who believe in the Christian Heaven DO believe that humans have been able to go there since the existence of mankind.  Science owns religion in what, having a reason for everything?  Sure, but religion isn’t based on reason; it’s based on faith.  It’s like comparing apples to oranges, and whatever you believe is what you believe.  It’s impossible to argue which is more right than the other, and that’s not what I’m here to do.  Hmmm… and is science the basis of your “start another life” theory?  I’m not sure I’ve ever seen that in any reference books…</p>

Im a ex-Christian, converted Muslim. I have been following Christianity for most of my life; age 0-21, and I probably have been actually following it and learning it for about 16 years of my 21 year span of following it. I probably know more about Christianity then you, so I say this as a ex-Christian that Islam is not a "knock-off" of Christianity. Yes, there are many similarities but there are MANY MORE diffrences.  I dont know alot about Islam, since I have been only following it and its laws for 4 years now, but again, I do know that it is not a "Knock-off" of Christianity.

              <p>[quote=“daiki, post:19, topic:770”]I don’t believe in Heaven or Hell. They are all made up by humans hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>Christian people: Do you think most of the people who died “before Jesus died” went to Hell or “eternal damnation”? And now you can get to Heaven if you just believe to God that isn’t showing at any way? And if you do not believe you can’t get to Heaven?</p>
<p>Christian religions are quite new if you compare them to Buddhism or Islam. And there are plenty of varieties of the Christian religions. I just think they are the worst, and hopefully get banned someday… A right to believe is fine, but it’s not fine to force kids to believe in something all made up. The human mind is dangerous; it can come up with just about anything.</p>
<p>I know some people may not appreciate my opinion about that, but it is what I think.[/quote]</p>
<p>Careful, you’re stepping in dangerous waters with that. I take a little offense, since I’m a Christian, but it’s okay; haha, this is debate/discussion right?<br>
People who died before Jesus came, died, and rose again -people in the Old Testament of The Bible- were saved by their faith that He (Jesus, The Messiah) was coming.  People who lived after His death and ascension into Heaven look back on His experience.  Readers: Don’t get confused.  Old Testament believers were not saved by faith alone; they were still held accountable for their actions. James 2:24 confirms man is “justified by works, not by faith only.” Mopar, your belief is half-Christian, have you ever considered becoming one?</p>
<p>As far as how relatively “new” Christianity is to Buddhism or Islam: At the time of Jesus, Christianity would be considered a Jewish sect. I would credit Paul with turning it into a separate religion, which pushes the extent of Christianity even further back in time.  In a sense, Christianity stretches back to the beginning of time, when all things were first created.  I’m willing to admit that I’m not quite educated on dates of Judaism confirmation, but I know that Buddhism is a way of life (a set of teachings), often distorted into religion, and that Islam is, if you will, a knock-off of Christianity.  Mohammed established Islam claiming to be the successor of Moses and Jesus!  Islam would be, in fact, newer than Christianity, anyway.</p>
<p>Your intolerance is disgusting.  I’m SURE that not everyone is forced into believing in Christianity.  Don’t you think that everyone can grow up and develop independent thought processes, or do you underestimate the power of the human mind?  You said it yourself: “The human mind is dangerous; it can come up with just about anything.”</p>

<p>well, thats just about every single religion dude...<br>Christianity <em>started</em> when Christ (Jesus) died on the cross to forgive everyone of their sins. Before then, you had to make a sacerfice of the youngest and pureist (no defects) lamb as a gift of innocence to be slaughterd for your sin (or if your were poor and in the city, birds).</p>

<p>If you look at different religions (muslim for example) they are all peace loving and stuff... when outnumberd. Go ahead and read the quran (their holy book) you'll see that its almost an exact replica of the Bible (Christian holy book) except Ishmale (brother of Isac) was put up as an offering to God instead of his brother Isac (other way around in Bible). Also in the quran it stats that they are a religion of war. They dont care if they lie to infadels (everyone including other muslims who are <em>lower</em> then them religiously) and you get browny points in the after life if you kill more infadels (especially Jews, kinda notice that the Jews pop up in alot of religions and wars as targets? wonder why... (because they were the choosen group!))</p>

<p>Yes but what makes you think only christains can go to heaven? Heck wasn't Jesus even jewish? Whats makes christianty any better then the other religions. So far buhda-ism(lol no idea how to spell it) seems the most convincing, and most realistic. </p>
<p>Anyways, I say the meaning of life(in my oppinion) is to perform useless tasks, and to form societies, like the puppets we are. Each of us have no purpose to be here, so I'm going to take advantage of that and just have fun.</p>
</blockquote></aside></p>
<p>I'm a Christian also, and IMO I think if there is a heaven and/or hell, why don't you join a religion just to make sure you won't go to hell, or wherever it is that you go? I think that the meaning of life is to live. I've also thought about it being God's test, but God has really never helped me other than letting me live, if he's real. Prayer never works, not for me anyways. =\ I believe there is a higher power out there, maybe not even God-like. Has anyone watched the movie "Animal House"? Think about the teacher's philosophy in there. It makes sence.</p>
</blockquote></aside>

<p>I think I've been told that believing in God just so you won't go to hell is an auto go to hell <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Not sure, but I think that's what I've heard.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm not really sure what the meaning of life is. I believe in God (the Big Bang? I mean come on...). I guess he's just testing us to see if our "souls" really are good, to see if we deserve to go to or back to heaven (I think we were all once there at one point, or somewhere close to it, but we can't remember any of it).</p>
