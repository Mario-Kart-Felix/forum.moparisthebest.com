    <description>Is cheating Evil?

In my opinion it is not, but it was once. I think Runescape used to be a great game. I don&#39;t think Runescape 2 ruined Runescape, I think the new attitude of Jagex ruined Runescape. They used to be about creating great games. Now they all it seems they think about is making the games they have already created turn a profit month after month update after update. One of the best gaming moments ever was player killing in the wilderness on runescape classic. Runescape does alot of things right in a game, and alot of things wrong. Jagex has the right to do things like introduce things like fatigue and random events, but shutting down Runescape Classic was evil. How much does it cost to run a Runescape classic server? What the fuck is wrong with them? Did they have to shut it down? No. They&#39;re just assholes. So let&#39;s cheat at they&#39;re game untill it&#39;s fully fucking destroyed.</description>

              <p>Actually cheating IS kinda evil.<br>
Jagex is trying to earn money BUT they do it by ruining the game for us.Think about it some more,and you will find that without runescape,this would almost be all gone.The neopets section would be one of the only surviving sections.We can cheat but try to think about jagex,even though they are __________(fill in the blanks with the appropriate word).</p>
<p>In a way,we need to thank jagex or else,where would we all be?Kaitnieks,mopar,all the great coders would be leading a normal life with no recognition whatsoever and we wouldn’t even know they exist.Sure,their rules may be crossing the limit for some of you but hey,rules are there to make things safer.I may sound pro jagex but I’m not.I hate the membership because you have to pay alot.They ARE irritating but they are also trying to make a living.</p>
<p>On the other hand,cheating Is not evil for the simple reason that jagex could ignore us and even create another server to let us try to practice our coding skills,but then we would have to have an agreement so as not to get on each others nerves.Of course jagex could always be lying to us but hey,cheating will never die.</p>
<p>I wasted alot of time proportionately to what I normaly use,so maybe you guys could ponder on this for a while</p>

basicly its like a war with jagex on one side and the whole cheating comunity on the other… both sides call the other one bad but basicly both are good because a small ammount of cheaters make up for people for example quiting rs etc.</p>

              <p>Never would I see cheating as evil, come to think of it. It’s more of a “Solution”.</p>
<p>Let’s make this clear, I do not hate Jagex, I do not hate Runescape. I cheated because it’s basicly in our nature to do so.<br>
Be serious, if you had the option to do the dishes or let the dishwasher do it, you would obviously pick the easy way out. It’s in our nature to do this and we have been doing it for the whole of our lives. Think about it, we design internet for the purpose of communication so physical transport is no longer needed in certain situations. We design cars and planes to get to places faster and thus saving time to do the things we like.</p>
<p>Why, tell me, should this be any different with cheating? Let’s face it, it’s not always fun to cut 10.000 yew logs in order to buy that one item that you want. True, it gives more satisfaction if you do it personal. But really, I don’t care, and I’m guessing you don’t either.</p>
<p>But, to be honest, that is not my main reason to cheat. I cheat because, when I look at Runescape I see a problem. A problem that can be solved, making a bot, or basicly any cheat in a game brings tons of problems, and I take joy in solving problems.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">In short, No. Cheating is not evil</span></p>

<p>Pfff… Cheating isn’t evil. Cheating is fun! Sometimes I don’t like to cheat, like on certain games like Final Fantasy 7. I tried my best and eventually I beat the game without cheats, and it was a lot of fun too.</p>
<p>Cheating on rs isn’t illegal so nobody really cares… unless you create your own private server with RuneScape code and have disobeyed copyright infringements which is illegal. THEN I won’t lol.</p>

<p>In my opinion it is not, but it was once. I think Runescape used to be a great game. I don’t think Runescape 2 ruined Runescape, I think the new attitude of Jagex ruined Runescape. They used to be about creating great games. Now they all it seems they think about is making the games they have already created turn a profit month after month update after update. One of the best gaming moments ever was player killing in the wilderness on runescape classic. Runescape does alot of things right in a game, and alot of things wrong. Jagex has the right to do things like introduce things like fatigue and random events, but shutting down Runescape Classic was evil. How much does it cost to run a Runescape classic server? What the fuck is wrong with them? Did they have to shut it down? No. They’re just assholes. So let’s cheat at they’re game untill it’s fully fucking destroyed.[/quote]</p>
<p>not really about cheat but more the fact that they fucking whiped out the whole wildy by creating tb spells and  shti its soo annoying pking used to be soo fun now i always die in the wildy no matter what</p>
