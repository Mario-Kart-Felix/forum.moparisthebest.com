    <description>OK so i am wondering how i could sort of have a high score for KDR on the login screen. so when a person isn&#39;t logged in yet (next to the user and pass thing) a KDR list would appear. i honestly have no idea how to do it, 1 way would be to load it up from a host (000webhost) database and put it in there. anybody know how this in anyway would work or if it is atleast possible?</description>
