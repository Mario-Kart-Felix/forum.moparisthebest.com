    <title>Thief 4</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thief-4/547003</link>
    <description>Is anybody else really digging this game? Awesome mechanics, sweet visuals, and Thief purists hate it, so you know it&#39;s awesome. I&#39;m really a fanboi for this game. It&#39;s really amazing. The atmosphere is dark steampunk, the characters are really interesting, and you can play any way you want, sneaking around through the shadows, sniping guards with your bow, or running across the rooftops like a maniac and jumping into peoples apartments, smacking them in the face, and grabbing their wallets.

              <p>Finished the game. I loved the plot and characters. There were many similarities to Deus Ex and Bioshock Infinite, which was not a bad thing. Gameplay could have been tweaked, but overall it was extremely immersive and entertaining.</p>

              <p>It was a great game, I just lost interest in the game… The gameplay got a bit repetitive for me</p>
