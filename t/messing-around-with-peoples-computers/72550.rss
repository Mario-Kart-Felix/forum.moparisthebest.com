2. download and install free version of log-me-in program by clicking &quot;add computer&quot; on the main page when logged in (for firefox you have to install the plugin or you get some cstupid java socket errors...)

3.Make sure you have installed the program on your computer and the other computer (when it asks for email in pass use your login id for website and use the same login email+pass on the other computer suring setup)

4.now that you have downloaded it and installed it on both computers make sure it is enabled on both computers then once you have dont that go to logmein.com and login to your account then click on the name of the computer that you wish to connect to and control and then it will ask a few things which you should be able to figure out

This is awesome. I dled this on my friends computer when he wasn’t looking and installed it and did exactly what you just said. He didn’t know, then i went home and did all crazy stuff on it. Such as:</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]Going to porn websites<br>
[</em>]Changing his suer preferences<br>
[*]And a heap more cool stuff.[/ul]</p>
<p>Thanks for the tutorial man.</p>
