&lt;blockquote&gt;[center][b][u]Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one. My plans for Rune Legacy[/u][/center]

A little bit about myself and my Project Rune Legacy: Hello I&#39;m Genesis and I&#39;m 17 years old. That is all you need to know about me. I started Rune Legacy around Mid October, I stopped the project because of personal reasons as well as issues with my Paypal Account. Now I&#39;m working on it, but as a different server.
My goals for Rune Legacy isn&#39;t to be another &quot;RuneScape Remake&quot;, as I am a person that is very aware of my surroundings and I have noticed that 80% of those remakes end up failing.

No no, my plans for Rune Legacy are different. I have been a fan of RuneScape since 2006, so you will notice a lot of things taken from RuneScape and added here. But what my main goal is to mix what RuneScape has, and create my own artistic style of this game. I want to create something unique and different from all other servers, something to brag about and say &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m the person that made that!&quot;. I want to take a simple idea, and take it beyond comprehension of what other servers have. 

So with that, now I must say. I am not the best Java Programmer. I started Rune Legacy on October, and that was my first time ever working with Java, but my knowledge has expanded. And it&#39;s only growing more actually, by the second. 

Okay, so now about experience. Most server have a very basic skilling and are practically all the same in every server I personally ever joined. For example, Mining is click the rock get full inventory and bank. If there&#39;s an ::empty command you can actually abuse that and bot on some server. I don&#39;t want this, I don&#39;t want that for Rune Legacy. Determination and effort, that&#39;s how you get a Skill Cape in RuneScape. But this isn&#39;t RuneScape this is Rune Legacy.

So I&#39;m taking some of their ideas but not all. In my Mining, when you mine ores they will deplete and respawn. This might be annoying for some people, but I can tell you it shouldn&#39;t be as I&#39;m not making skilling too hard nor too easy. Mining isn&#39;t the only skill I&#39;ve improved, just the one I&#39;m using an example of as of right now. As I am improving ALL the classes and making sure everything is neat.

Note: This isn&#39;t a skilling server only. It is Skilling, Merching, Player Killing, Questing, Minigame MMO server. Just as RuneScape. I want to make it so all the level 3&#39;s and 40&#39;s are having just as much fun as the level 80&#39;s and 120&#39;s. I&#39;m going to balance everything out.

If you read this, thank you and I do hope you play Rune Legacy in the near future. If you didn&#39;t, I hope you still play and enjoy the pictures I have provided.[center]

<p>Rewritten them. Sanity’s sucked, I’m still working on rewriting Prayer, Farming, Herblore, Thieving and a few others. The only thing that concerns me about Herblore is whether or not I should make it like in RS, with the Eyes of Newt, Silver Dusts and other 3rd items. (Since it’s a Private Server though, I don’t think people would want to do that  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> ) But thank you  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<blockquote>Dude I will trade you any other event for the mime one I have everyone except that one..</blockquote>
<p>I already have most of them including the random chickens and spirit trees. Only one I really need are gravedigger and frog events, but they shouldn’t be hard to add.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em> Updated the main post.</p>

<p>It’s against my fourth amendment rights, the right to privacy, and that would be illegal. A Forum is something private, and a TOS states that. If they are violating my terms then there’s nothing they can do because they agreed to it when they entered the website.</p>
<blockquote>The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution is the part of the Bill of Rights which guards against unreasonable searches and seizures, along with requiring any warrant to be judicially sanctioned and supported by probable cause. It was adopted as a response to the abuse of the writ of assistance, which is a type of general search warrant, in the American Revolution. Search and arrest should be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer, who has sworn by it.</blockquote>
<p>To everyone besides Clawz and the other people that are hating on my thread for no reason</p>
<p>Thank you for your support. Server will actually be up sooner then I thought, it now supports full screen and I fixed a lot of the stuff there. Preload models work now, gameplay feels smoother.<br>
I really do hope you guys enjoy playing it.</p>
