    <title>Is it possible to change the name of an item?</title>

    <description>The dharoks great axe was called &quot;3dharok great axe&quot;

I removed the &quot;3&quot; in the beginning in item.cfg and then when I logged on to server it was called only a &quot;dharok great axe&quot;

I thought... If i can change the name of the dharoks great axe....

...I can change the name of the ogre comp bow to &quot;dark_bow&quot;

well... It didnt work.  Is this even possible? And if not why was I able to change the dharok gr8 axe then?</description>
