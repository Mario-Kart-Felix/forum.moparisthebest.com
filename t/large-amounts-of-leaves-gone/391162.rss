    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/large-amounts-of-leaves-gone/391162</link>
    <description>ok near where i am if i walk not too far of a distance i can find trees w/o leaves. like 50 or more. u can see this from the server map. i wouldnt think it was forest fires b/c the wood would be gone too right? the trees are still in place they just dont have leaves. this also happened to my underground tree farm. what is going on?</description>

<p>Didn’t bother us much cause we needed the wood, but still… Very weird.[/quote]<br>
Let it bother you, as it means no branches to re-plant trees.</p>
