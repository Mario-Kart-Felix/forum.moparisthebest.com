    <description>[size=36pt]can someone who knows cheezscape please read this and give me a legitimate answer?[/size]

[size=14pt]all i need atm is to know why that in cheezscape you can not:

1. sell any items in the stores.
2. get money from anywhere.
3. make a simple shop that will not spaz the server when it is setup[/size]

i am using cheezscape as a base i have already customized it quite a bit. the only thing that i see that are very wrong is the economy (there is none)</description>

              <p>atm…my server will not let me sell anything at the shops…even the items that are in the shops. also when you spawn money from the character files you can use it but then when you bank it and try and get it out again it comes out in increments of 1</p>
