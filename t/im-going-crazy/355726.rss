    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to make a server for that past 5 days *ahem* sorry not make just TEST to see if it will go online. And I can&#39;t get it I don&#39;t know why!!!! I&#39;m portforwarded(at least I think) I even used port checker to see if it was opened and it said yes. I&#39;m on a laptop thats using wifi does that make a difference? I&#39;m using the Exion source/client and I can play from local host but as soon as I change to no-ip on the client it just says &quot;error connecting to server&quot; what is wrong! Do I need ethernet connection could it be the client am I portforwarding the wrong way.

I have verizon and they have a pretty limited way to portforward so I&#39;m not sure if its that or what. I need help please just help me this sucks so bad I have no problem editing server and everything I just need to get it online I will do anything. Need screenshots what? ANYTHING I will give any information please please please help this sucks so bad. What about that teamviewer thing I&#39;ll do whatever.

EDIT:

- Yes I followed the 2 tutorials in the help/tutorial section.
- I have no-ip
- port checker says 43594 is open.
- I have verizon so you can&#39;t access the router you do it from verizon if anyone has done this please help me
- I have edited the client.java and put my no-ip
- After all these great things it still says &quot;error connecting to server&quot;
- IS IT BECAUSE I&#39;M USING WIFI????</description>

<p>Dude was that a joke? Of course I have researched my ass off for 5 days I looked at that tutorial numerous times.</p>
<p>Its not getting JDK or even really portforwarding. Its about getting the server online which none of the tutorials show how to do. Man I need help I even use port checker and it says 43594 is open and then the server won’t go online WTF.</p>
