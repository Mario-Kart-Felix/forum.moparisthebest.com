              <p>ok, was in a hurry when i wrote the question, when i want to trade over items that are destroyable and not dropable i aint possible to trade them over to other people and was wondering if this is fixable or able to put into GE (using Zenith’s source) also ive tried to make one of my cousins admin whit just trying the ::setrights 2 (Name)  but i cant take ::setrights 0 and ive fixed this somehow by fixing on a file on the server but i need to compile to make it work everythime i use setrights, i tried to make them admin to make them possible to spawn the items because we had a fun Dice game whit some Xmas items and such, this is just a server me and my cousins play on (A bit sad that people cant buy Anchor and such because its glitched in shop and its ‘‘destroy’’ able item when u trying to trade over that makes it Non-tradeable or dropable for them to pickup) so easy question here:</p>
<p>How can i fix that i can take ::setrights 0 (when i try i get you lower rites ;P)<br>
and make Non-tradeable items Tradeable.</p>

              <p>Usually servers have an array of items you cannot trade</p>
<p>and what do you mean? when you use a command? your being too vague in your explanation.</p>
<p>edit: sorry i didn’t see you were using a 667 im not familiar with that protocol things may be different, my apologies</p>
