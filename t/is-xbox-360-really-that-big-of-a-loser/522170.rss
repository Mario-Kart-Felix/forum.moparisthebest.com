    <title>Is Xbox 360 really that big of a loser!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-xbox-360-really-that-big-of-a-loser/522170</link>
    <description>I&#39;m comparing the graphics against a PC here.. The Xbox fan boys are giving the only option of &quot;ROFL Xbox 360 has just barely visible quality difference and is so much cheaper than a PC!&quot; Yes, it is cheaper, but let&#39;s see now, my housemate has just yesterday bought RAGE for his box. I wanted to see if this game is even close to the Bethesda standard. Really, the textures are just ridiculous! A metal sheet looks like adding the &quot;cloud&quot; filter in photoshop with both fore- and background color a different kind of gray. then add a strong noise filter and smooth the hell out of it, there you have this super-photorealistic piece of legendary metal texture! Seriously, the textures make me want to cry! Is this only in the Xbox version or is there really these kind of bad excuse for textures on the PC version too!? :O
And while the price may still seem legit; the games for Xbox cost 10-20€ more than the PC versions! And compare the possibilities of what you can do with a PC and a Xbox 360.. Really I see zero good reasons to own a console these days! Of course except if I get it for like 20€ and get these Pac-Man and Tetris quality games with a special discount..</description>

              <p>Well, at this point, I’d like to ask, how many of you Xbox mockers are liking Playstation? To get an unbiased answer, I will not count these PS fans in my final conclusion whether the age of consoles is corrupted and gone. I’ve heard this 360 degrees joke before and still find it funny how wrong it went.</p>
<p>Also, the link Ox posted. Is this actually what it is about? Xbox users say they don’t care about graphics, but what is the difference in Xbox 360 and Xbox One in this case? You get the latest games? As if there wasn’t more games than you can ever find time to play through!?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/davidi2">@Davidi2</a>, is it called selling at that point?</p>

<p>^ This.<br>
They pretty much said that it’ll be treated just as the Xbox 360 is.</p>
<blockquote>An internet connection will not be required to play offline Xbox One games - After a one-time system set-up with a new Xbox One, you can play any disc based game without ever connecting online again. There is no 24 hour connection requirement and you can take your Xbox One anywhere you want and play your games, just like on Xbox 360.
<p>Trade-in, lend, resell, gift, and rent disc based games just like you do today - There will be no limitations to using and sharing games, it will work just as it does today on Xbox 360.</p>
<p>In addition to buying a disc from a retailer, you can also download games from Xbox Live on day of release. If you choose to download your games, you will be able to play them offline just like you do today. Xbox One games will be playable on any Xbox One console – there will be no regional restrictions.</p>
<p>These changes will impact some of the scenarios we previously announced for Xbox One. The sharing of games will work as it does today, you will simply share the disc. Downloaded titles cannot be shared or resold. Also, similar to today, playing disc based games will require that the disc be in the tray.</p>
<p>We appreciate your passion, support and willingness to challenge the assumptions of digital licensing and connectivity. While we believe that the majority of people will play games online and access the cloud for both games and entertainment, we will give consumers the choice of both physical and digital content. We have listened and we have heard loud and clear from your feedback that you want the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your candid feedback. Our team remains committed to listening, taking feedback and delivering a great product for you later this year.</p>

<p>Sorry Luke, I’m just fuelling your anger… But hey, is it really a thing that serious? I don’t find Xbox (nor Playstation.) suitable for me. I made this topic without considering the hatred I instantly get from Xboxians. My original question was wondering if textures are really that bad on “The Almighty XBOX 360”. I have only gathered info on four games so far for this… You can still prove me wrong and show me any game where the textures at least would be of quality. Now that I think about it, Skyrim looks okay on consoles too.</p>

The gameplay sucks nuts with it’s lovely bugs… Gaah! I really feel like punching anyone of the story-inventors of this game.<br>
[/quote]<br>
You try making a game with no bugs in it at all. There will be bugs because you’re only human.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>And the lovely ending credits! Of course! I just DEMAND to sit there waiting half an hour to get back to menu so I can be sure the game is over!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Uhmm… Both of these are in any type of game no matter what console/PC it is on…</p>
<p>Are you sure you’re trying to rip on the Xbox 360 or just video games in general?[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, yep, I got sidetracked badly there…<br>
While asking the first of your statements I feel like you talk to me as I were a retard… Of course games have bugs! It’s just the question are these bugs funny/acceptable or mind tearing because of their annoyance. For example, Tony Hawk’s Underground 2 was a superb game because of it’s bugs. Aaaand before any supernaturally smart person starts with “THUG 2 was for Playstation 2! iwhjgfoiaewhrgoiuh!111!12!” I know, the difference is, Playstation 2 had no difficulties in being modded (Of course, the games you make a burned version you have to have had the original, right? There’s no pirates on this planet!?) The Playstation had free access to Multiplayer capabilities and was made on the golden age of consoles. Especially that, at this point the games had (IMO) better storytelling. This is my opinion, feel free to flame, but that will be what remains until you get a direct downside on PC gaming except “It’s too costy!”. If we take this idea as a “weapon”, you can get a decent computer with not that much more than the box. And, have more desirable movement/pointing options. I know some people get their controller rooted in their hands and they are faster on working with the controller than with the keyboard… Let’s see the speed by the fastest do-everythingers with these both… I’m pretty sure the fastest keyboard warrior wins any controller ninja.</p>
<p>To summarize my answer on the second statement of yours, I have sidetracked to the point I was letting my disappointment on Crysis 3 flow throw, but the bottom line is: If I am liking my games with working gameplay, good story and how the story is told with the addition of wanting to see progress in graphics and technology by observing what I see and feel, I think the best choice for me is the PC. You know that if you don’t really care about graphics, and want the story telling you can use books…? Also, if you want interaction in the story, have a deep long conversation with someone who also read the book. Better yet, if you want a total control of your story, write your own book!</p>
<p>You see, I have my little point here, I wasn’t either actually flaming the Xbox to begin with. My choice of Topic name is really bad, yes. I’m sorry to hurt peoples butts when not necessary. I’m not really an aggressive sort of a person. My word choices might be too colorful at times to be clear what I mean. This is also the exact reason this reply is once again in size of a novel. Peace people, I got my answer by you elf in your first reply I guess…</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Paparoach</span> fanboy, I find the line between rants and discussions very easily definable by the way you think about it… While I might easily find priests having their speech like a rant, some people might find it inspiring or pretty much what ever they think of it. The band you are advertising for free(?) is good. (If I don’t add the words telling this is my opinion, someone might feel this as preaching peoples to listening to this band.)</p>
<p>Finally <span class="mention">@Ox</span>, I got the impression of the opposite, aren’t the games usually made for PC before being ported to consoles…? Excuse my lack of information on this part of the topic, I just don’t see it very easy to think the graphical effects are added in on top of the original product…?</p>
