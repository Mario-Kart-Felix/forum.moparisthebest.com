    <title>Adding Shops? I keep getting this error when I runserv</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-shops-i-keep-getting-this-error-when-i-runserv/152819</link>
    <description>I set up my shops and everything works good when i compile but then when i run serv and try to log in i get a shop handler error and it disconnects everyone...I dont know what the problem is if it is Item.java or what. I&#39;m pretty sure I added the shops right though. If anyone knows how to fix this problem please tell me.</description>

              <p>Hmm if your new at creating shops, npc spawns, co-ords i would suggest using programs used for making them… Many sources have them included somewhere. Try finding Funscap3 2 I know there is an exellent folder with some of the best generators i have seen.</p>
