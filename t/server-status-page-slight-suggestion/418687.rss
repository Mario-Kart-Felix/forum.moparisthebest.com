    <title>Server Status Page Slight Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-status-page-slight-suggestion/418687</link>
    <description>Hallo,

I think there is a category that is missing from the server status page that should be added... A &quot;GUI&quot; section, what revision number of graphical interface is the server using. If you click on a &#39;supposed&#39; 317, you get a 508 + interfaced server or something like that...when it isn&#39;t even a 317, but a 508 +. This would be a good feature to have to on the server status page as it will help you to know which servers you&#39;d like to play.

Thanks For Reading.</description>

If someone wanted only 459, 508,634, etc… interfaces… they could sort it by that, and get what they want. Or just see that infact there’s no such thing as a 317 interfaced servers anymore XD</p>

              <p>Although semi handy, there are so few real 317’s out there that arent shitty hybrid pvp’s its really not worth it. Sure, we could do this, but it would just take up room. [sarcasm]I honestly think they should have a hybrid pvp based, to get rid of 90% of servers, when sifting through it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> [/sarcasm]</p>
