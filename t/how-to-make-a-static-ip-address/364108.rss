    <title>How To Make A Static IP Address</title>

    <description>
  So, when you portforward, you enter your ip address into your router and the port you want it on.  But an IP address can change, and then it try&#39;s to portforward your old address, but that address is non-existent.

  This tutorial is for XP users.  Probably will be the same with Vista and 7.

First, hit Start and open the Control Panel.  

Then find Network Connections

Right click on whatever your connection is (like Local Area Connection 2), and hit Properties.

Then select Internet Protocol TCP/IP, and hit Properties

Minimize that window.
Click start and hit Run.
Type cmd.
Type in ipconfig/all

Find your connection.

It should look like this
[img]http://www.bwenhost.webs.com/3.bmp[/img]

Find (IP Address)  It will be 192.168.0. (something)
Find Default Gateway
Find DHCP Server
Find DNS Servers
Find Subnet Mask

Remember those.  There all 192.168.0.1 for me.  For most, its 192.168.1.1

Open back up the Protocol TCP/IP.  It should say Obtain IP Address automatically.  Select Use The Following IP Address.

Type the IP Address you want to use Example: Mine is 192.168.0.60
Your subnet mask should be 255.255.255.0 by default.  I think it will even put the subnet mask in for you.
Enter your default gateway.  Mine is 192.168.0.1  Yours will probably be 192.168.1.1 or something...

Find Preferred DNS Server.  Enter yours.  It should be the same as your default gateway.
Leave alternate blank.  

You can repair or disable and re-enable your connection to make sure it worked.  Then go to cmd and type ipconfig to check.

Your done!!!!!!!</description>

<p>It does really, that’s how it all works. IP adresses are getting rarer each day, there are even black markets in several countries that sell IP adresses.

<p>As IPv4 uses 32 bits, and can hold up to 232 addresses, whereas IPv6 is 128 bits, and can hold up to 2128 addresses. IPv6 was also developed for faster processing, as it has a fixed header length of only 40 bytes.</p>

<p>You looked up the difference between IPv4 abd IPv6 and gave me information that I already had to learn for my previous exams. If you really want to know more about the selling of IP addresses you could also just google it. “ip address black market” gives enough hits on google to explain it to you.</p>

Seeing as how this does not surpass mine, it’s not allowed. What would the point be of two of the same tutorial?</p>

              <p>So, when you portforward, you enter your ip address into your router and the port you want it on.  But an IP address can change, and then it try’s to portforward your old address, but that address is non-existent.</p>
<p>This tutorial is for XP users.  Probably will be the same with Vista and 7.</p>
<p>First, hit Start and open the Control Panel.</p>
<p>Then find Network Connections<br>
<img src="http://www.bwenhost.webs.com/1.bmp" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Right click on whatever your connection is (like Local Area Connection 2), and hit Properties.</p>
<p>Then select Internet Protocol TCP/IP, and hit Properties<br>
<img src="http://www.bwenhost.webs.com/2.bmp" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Minimize that window.<br>
Click start and hit Run.<br>
Type cmd.<br>
Type in ipconfig/all</p>
<p>Find your connection.</p>
<p>It should look like this<br>
<img src="http://www.bwenhost.webs.com/3.bmp" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Find (IP Address)  It will be 192.168.0. (something)<br>
Find Default Gateway<br>
Find DHCP Server<br>
Find DNS Servers<br>
Find Subnet Mask</p>
<p>Remember those.  There all 192.168.0.1 for me.  For most, its 192.168.1.1</p>
<p>Open back up the Protocol TCP/IP.  It should say Obtain IP Address automatically.  Select Use The Following IP Address.</p>
<p>Type the IP Address you want to use Example: Mine is 192.168.0.60<br>
Your subnet mask should be 255.255.255.0 by default.  I think it will even put the subnet mask in for you.<br>
Enter your default gateway.  Mine is 192.168.0.1  Yours will probably be 192.168.1.1 or something…</p>
<p>Find Preferred DNS Server.  Enter yours.  It should be the same as your default gateway.<br>
Leave alternate blank.</p>
<p>You can repair or disable and re-enable your connection to make sure it worked.  Then go to cmd and type ipconfig to check.</p>
<p>Your done!!!</p>
