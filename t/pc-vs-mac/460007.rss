    <title>PC vs. Mac?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pc-vs-mac/460007</link>
    <description>This is debated all the time, thought I&#39;d start another debate here, on a common question. Pc or Macs? I&#39;ll state my thoughts on both, and which I&#39;d pick, hopefully others choose to do the same!

PCs
Pros:
- Wonderful for programming.
- Control over your computer.
- Greatly Customizable (Software Wise; Look, Software, etc.)
- Greatly Customizable (Hardware Wise; Video Cards, Sound Cards, Specify Ram, etc.)
- Not too expensive.
- Pretty much needed for a good gaming experience.

Cons:
- Prone to viruses (If you don&#39;t protect it properly).
- Need a new one every six to eight years.

Macintosh
Pros:
- I consider it a, &#39;do&#39; computer, because it does what you need it to.
- Wonderful for Internet Browsing, Checking Email, Watching Videos, etc.
- Last a long time (8-12 years from past experience and knowledge.)
- Wonderful Display on newer Macs

Cons:
- Pretty Expensive (Much more than a PC with same specs.)
- Not the best for Gaming.
- Not for those who want to program and do more with a PC.
- Not the best for customization.

Personally I would choose PC all the way, I grew up using PCs, and they&#39;re cheaper, and as a gamer and programmer, it works better for me personally. However, Macintosh is amazing with devices other than computers. Such as the new iPhone 5, and Ipod Touches, I own an Ipod Touch because for a music player, I just want it to work, and play music, which Mac is wonderful at doing. (My phone however is an Android)

Now it&#39;s your time! Let me know what you think, and list reasons why, if you want. Everyone has different view points, hopefully we can keep this a clean, and friendly debate.</description>

<p>I’d love for you to justify this. If you are talking about the operating system, OSX is just as customisable, and in many places, it is easier to customise the hidden stuff, that neither Apple or Microsoft expose for customisation. You just need to know what you are doing.</p>
<p>As for programming? What? That is a ridiculous thing to say. I want your reasons.</p>
<p>In regards to the whole ‘Macs are better for media’ and whatever: No. There were times when Adobe were favourable to the Mac, Photoshop was an exclusive Macintosh release for a while, but that changed a long time ago. Adobe’s suite of applications, and all sorts of other related applications are typically just as good on Windows as they are on OSX.</p>
<p>Unless you prefer Apple’s Final Cut, Aperture, Logic, etc, then Macs are no better suited to ‘media production’ than a Windows machine.</p>

<p>I use Linux variants for mostly everything else. Unix is very similar, so I’m comfortable there too. Since OS X is based in Unix, I can also use it. The real set off for me with Windows is the fact the shell sucks cock and doesn’t have the familiar GNU utils. Also, POSIX libs for Unix are much better than their smelly Microsoft counterparts.</p>
<p>An operating system is a tool akin to a hammer or saw, not your favorite ice cream flavour. You wouldn’t try to drive a nail with a toothbrush, now would you?</p>

              <p>I absolutely hate macs, Especially because of the one click. It’s horrific, I hate them. Another reason I would never get a mac is because most RSPS dont provide mac clients. Although I am a little big wishy washy about this, because I hear that mac’s are good at not getting virus’s. I’m always getting Viruses on PC <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>[quote=“The Web Guy, post:1, topic:460007”]PCs<br>
Pros:</p>

<p>no more so than mac or linux</p>

</ul>
<p>DEFINITELY not more so than linux</p>
<p>[quote=“The Web Guy, post:1, topic:460007”]Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prone to viruses (If you don’t protect it properly).</li>
<li>Need a new one every six to eight years.[/quote]</li>
</ul>
<p>nope and nope, at least, newer versions of windows aren’t significantly more prone to viruses and as for needing a new one every six to eight years, name a operating system or platform that DOESN’T require regular yearly renewals, I have a 6 year old laptop that’s still going strong and my 7-8 year old pc would still be going strong but it was a mid-low end model at the time we bought it so it all depends on what hardware you buy to begin with</p>
<p>[quote=“The Web Guy, post:1, topic:460007”]Macintosh<br>
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>I consider it a, ‘do’ computer, because it does what you need it to</li>
<li>Wonderful for Internet Browsing, Checking Email, Watching Videos, etc.</li>
<li>Last a long time (8-12 years from past experience and knowledge.)</li>
<li>Wonderful Display on newer Macs[/quote]</li>
</ul>
<p>again, all points that aren’t exclusive to mac, windows and linux can “do what you need it to”, windows and linux can be “wonderful for internet browsing”, last a long time and have wonderful displays</p>
<p>and as for macs, if you have an 8-12 year old mac I’d suggest you look up newer apple products, because they SCREAM planned obsolescence</p>

<p>there’s a few extremely specialised programs on mac but as stated, extremely specialised, if your professional career requires them and you are employed you’ll be provided with a mac either way</p>

<p>that hasn’t been true for a looooooong time and even back then it wasn’t true, but macs are still ridiculously expensive and building your own desktop is still by far the cheapest option</p>

              <p>This is debated all the time, thought I’d start another debate here, on a common question. Pc or Macs? I’ll state my thoughts on both, and which I’d pick, hopefully others choose to do the same!</p>
<p>PCs<br>
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wonderful for programming.</li>
<li>Control over your computer.</li>
<li>Greatly Customizable (Software Wise; Look, Software, etc.)</li>
<li>Greatly Customizable (Hardware Wise; Video Cards, Sound Cards, Specify Ram, etc.)</li>
<li>Not too expensive.</li>
<li>Pretty much needed for a good gaming experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prone to viruses (If you don’t protect it properly).</li>
<li>Need a new one every six to eight years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Macintosh<br>
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>I consider it a, ‘do’ computer, because it does what you need it to.</li>
<li>Wonderful for Internet Browsing, Checking Email, Watching Videos, etc.</li>
<li>Last a long time (8-12 years from past experience and knowledge.)</li>
<li>Wonderful Display on newer Macs</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty Expensive (Much more than a PC with same specs.)</li>
<li>Not the best for Gaming.</li>
<li>Not for those who want to program and do more with a PC.</li>
<li>Not the best for customization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I would choose PC all the way, I grew up using PCs, and they’re cheaper, and as a gamer and programmer, it works better for me personally. However, Macintosh is amazing with devices other than computers. Such as the new iPhone 5, and Ipod Touches, I own an Ipod Touch because for a music player, I just want it to work, and play music, which Mac is wonderful at doing. (My phone however is an Android)</p>
<p>Now it’s your time! Let me know what you think, and list reasons why, if you want. Everyone has different view points, hopefully we can keep this a clean, and friendly debate.</p>
