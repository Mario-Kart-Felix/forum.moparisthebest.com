    <description>Oh shit, its a topic about rep again.

Anyways, I feel like there should be a rep reset on the entire community, spare the moderators. I&#39;ve noticed that some people who get 200 rep change entirely and feel like they can do whatever they want to without any consequence. It sickens me in all honestly. I don&#39;t care about rep, but it seems to get to quite a few people&#39;s heads &lt;.&lt;...

Anyways, at the least consider it I suppose, thanks for reading.</description>

Numerous people who have posted in here I have seen stating that reputation is unnecessary and doesn’t dictate the quality of your posts and your general input to the community. Personally it took me a long time to get my reputation points up because I came into this community as a complete idiot; but if you feel so strongly that reputation is invalid, why care?</p>

If in your eyes rep is useless then why offer community member positions to people with 50+ rep on both forums?[/quote]<br>
We don’t, it used to be that way years ago but hasn’t been for quite a while.</p>
<p>[quote=“jme, post:64, topic:382170”]I like the idea about being able to thank people, and it would just display who has thanked them at the bottom of their post.</p>
<p>No numbers involved. And the less rules involved with it, the better.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t try to fix rep, or try to make it meaningful in any way. Why? Because that is impossible, as mopar said you should only judge a person by the quality or helpfulness of their posts and there is no way to regulate that. Even the proposed thank you system would mean nothing, but I think it’s still nice to have?[/quote]<br>
Yes, if a system like this was implemented, I wouldn’t want it to keep any numbers.  It would just show the number of thanks on the actual post itself, nowhere on the profile.</p>

<p>This thread I posted is a pretty good example of why low rep people are usually treated like morons.<br>
For those of you who are not familiar with the models section: All this guy did was color a jagex model in black and yellow and posted a picture, everyone under 20 says “OMFG PLSKE RELES IT OMG FUCKN EPIC”.</p>

<p>I don’t think it was ever +1… long ago we didn’t have limits… Their was a reset a while back because people like silabsoft had a ridiculously high number and 1 rep from them could give you something like +50 rep on a rep. Then MITB set forth the 1-13 rep and a 200 cap…</p>
<p>I think it would be better to just have moderators, admins able to give rep. This way the only real people who have rep are the ones who release something helpful, quality, and worth repping… No repping someone because they helped you in the “Help Section”, or repping someone just to give them 199-200 rep again. With the mods and admins in control then rep can mean something, it can mean that you have contributed something to the community to help the community move forward.[/quote]</p>
<p>It could’ve been +1 before you were here, you haven’t been here forever. (Neither have I, I’m just saying it could’ve been.) And with that system in place, I don’t think anyone would have any rep, maybe besides like Graham and Blakeman8192.</p>

Like 1/3 of the page is taken up by thank you’s. It’s mostly on the big tutorials like ‘How to start a server’ and the like, but surely there must be a way to limit the number of shown thanks?</p>
<p>The only thing I don’t like is that in removes the anonymity of the thanks. Can’t really say much without knowing details about the mod, but I know that people don’t always like others to see who they thank, which is why rep logs are private right now. (<span class="bbcode-b">Now that I think about it, making rep logs public might solve the problems as well!</span>)</p>

<p>No numbers involved. And the less rules involved with it, the better.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t try to fix rep, or try to make it meaningful in any way. Why? Because that is impossible, as mopar said you should only judge a person by the quality or helpfulness of their posts and there is no way to regulate that. Even the proposed thank you system would mean nothing, but I think it’s still nice to have?</p>

My suggestion, thread/post thank you’s. If a person helps another user with a question, they can click “thank you” and move on. The user can see this and live happily knowing they helped someone. This method eliminates the need for users to whore themselves out with their 200 rep and their supposed elitism.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Someone else suggested that as well, and I’m not hating it.  It’s actually different and could work.[/quote]<br>
That was actually me that suggested that in the first page <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I think if we should use it, however, heres how it would work (how i see it)</p>
<ol>
<li>A user can thank another use ONLY once and that lasts forever (or resets every month to stay accurate)</li>
<li>Once a user thanks another user, under every post the user thanked made, they have a “Thankful Users” And the list of users that thanked that user (Default on alot of forums though)</li>
<li>There is not a negative system, or a way of taking it away, so like i said, i think it should either be forever, or resets every month automatically so the users who thank would be more accurate, by that i mean things could change, or to prevent people from piling another users thank list, and if im correct, that might lag the server, right? Which is why i think it should reset every month, so the forums would be running smooth</li>
<li>This way, new users, and i mean 90% of people in the help section could properly thank users instead of offering a rep++ when they cant even do that, but there should still be some kind of requirement</li>
<li>And like i said, as for an requirement, maybe post count to 50? Or something else… Maybe need to be registered with that account on the forums for… a week? 2 weeks?</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyways, i hope you take what i wrote into consideration, personally, i think it would work nicely.</p>
