    <title>NPCs behaving like bots</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npcs-behaving-like-bots/529435</link>
    <description>What if we were to add NPCs that acted like bots? One thing that makes me sad is a RSC server that feels lonely. Traditional NPCs don&#39;t chat with each other over the local chat channel, they do not do any skills, such as stand in lobster fishing spots and have cage activity bubbles appear over their heads, walk to the bank, and then walk back, they do not fight each other in the wilderness when they randomly meet enemy faction NPCs, and they do not walk paths between towns.

In Skyrim, you see all of that going on and as a single player game, it becomes a lot more enjoyable. Sprinkle that in a MMO and players might feel a little more willing to explore beyond what they know. How does this sound?</description>

<p>I don’t know why it would need to be multi-threaded, you could update thousands of NPCs each game cycle in a single threaded server as well.</p>
