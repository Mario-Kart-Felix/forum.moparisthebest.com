    <title>How do I get my server to be 24-7 VPS Hosted - Offering Payment</title>

    <description>Hello Mopar, I have been working on my server for a month or so now and I am unable to computer host it. I have around 80$ on my paypal account to help me purchase a VPS, but I simply have no clue on how it works. I cant work around my head how you can keep it online and update it, even when you turn your computer off. Which means someone else is hosting my source. Please dont think I sound dumb, I really dont know. If someone could explain to me in detail the steps in obtaining / buying a VPS, then intergrating it with my server I am happy to pay you some money through paypal. My email is &quot;chaoscape@live.com&quot; Email me if you are serious about helping me and/or  check if im on MSN. Happy Coding...</description>

              <p>vps gives the computer like more RAM, you wouldn’t be able to turn the server off and expect it to be online unless you have 2 computers one with vps and the other with the server but you would have to set the vps computer up with your source and client files from the other computer. If you bought it, it could still work only thing is you wouldnt be able to turn the computer off, it will probably just add more RAM aka (FREE SPACE) for you on the computer your hosting on and you would have to set it up or find someone 2 help btw vps cost monthly you can setup and paypal and buy it that way?</p>
