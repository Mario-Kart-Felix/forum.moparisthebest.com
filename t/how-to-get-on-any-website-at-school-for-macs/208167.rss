    <title>How to get on any website at school (For MACS)</title>

    <description>OK, you could use a web proxy, but that gets old and slow after a while. I&#39;m going to assume the following things:

[ul][li]Your school admin is retarded[/li]
[li]Your school uses mac computers[/li]
[li]You do not have access to the unix prompt on the macs[/li]
[li]Safari 2 is used for web browsing[/li]
[li]You are not incompetent at following simple guides[/li][/ul]

Open up Safari, and type in ssh://blah into the address bar. Wait a few seconds, perhaps a minute if you are on a shitty PPC eMac like the ones at my school. A terminal should open up, and give you an error message about &quot;blah&quot; not being a valid SSH host or something. Ignore it and open up a new shell under the File menu.
You now have access to a unix shell with limited user privileges.
OK, download Firefox for mac osx (dmg file). It should show up on your desktop or wherever you saved it. Go back to the terminal and cd to the location where it is saved, and type
hdiutil attach ./name_of_firefox_dmg.dmg
OK, we now have it mounted. Now changedir to
/Volumes/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/
and type ./firefox
Wait a few seconds to a minute and firefox should open right up.
You have successfully circumvented shitty GUI operation restraints by a stupid exploit in Safari.
I know at my school, all HTTP communications are monitored serverside by this filter named &quot;bess&quot;, which happens to only monitor Safari.

Yes, I found this out all  by myself.</description>

I doubt you found it out yourself. But nice tutorial.<br>
[/quote]<br>
You are wrong in both points. I did find it out myself, when I was trying to SSH into my local server from school. Also, it is a shitty hastily written tutorial that I put a very minimal amount of effort in to.[/quote]<br>
Sorry let me correct it,<br>

<p>Er, basically Mac OSX installs software from drive images, or dmg files. So you mount the disk image (dmg), and it appears in /Volumes/, you then can cd into the Firefox folder and find the binary executable, which of course can be run with ./firefox</p>
