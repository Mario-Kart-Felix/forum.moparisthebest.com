    <title>Mini-Game Contest ( Video )</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mini-game-contest-video/367895</link>
    <description>I had some time off today from school, so I messed around with my server some. it is nothing too great, and my coding knolledge is limited to an extent, but I enjoy learning, and Yong min has been a great supporter in not just myself alot of other people in the community that I have noticed. So Special Thanks to him. 

First Event, Made heal other to go with the weekly raids I made. 

Features 
- admins heal max
- prayer bonus + level increases your chance of hitting a crit heal which heals up to 88%
- cannot be used in duels, wild, or to heal duelers
- Heals up to 26% based on your prayer level
- Requires 90 magic to use
- can not heal if they are full health
~ I tested it around a bit today and didn&#39;t notice any bugs except sometimes if your directly 1 square diagnal from the player it will not heal. I&#39;ll look into perfecting it later and if anyone wants to go through the codes and help me fix it that works too.


second event~ Barrows or as I call I decided to call it Royal Chest.

- 3 undead royal family members.
- Loot is based on random chance 1-150, if you roll 0 you get cracker, 1-3 you get drag weapons, 4-25 you get rune, 26-75 for certs and skill objects, 76-150 for runes\junk. 
each catagory has 20 options, which it&#39;ll then roll 1-20 to decide which loot you get out of that catagory.

~after testing it only a few things unfinished\unresolved. Some of which you see in the video.
  I made it so a player can only get the npc when searching the coffin if their rank is set at 0 for that npc ( so they cant spawn multiple ones ). I how ever need to make away so no one else can attack it, and so if they go upstairs it&#39;ll remove them. shouldn&#39;t be too difficult just havn&#39;t done it yet.

~I also need to finish registuring server to client to take off the client LIst of which you have killed. If you log it will but need to make a command yet so it&#39;ll register it off when you loot chest.

~ Going to disable paralyze monster in there so that it makes it a bit more challenging to solo, unless you have a partner for healing back &amp; forth.

Other then that it works fine and its a good way for some one to make cash in your server. Hope you like, if not well i&#39;m only in this for fun and to learn something new so deal with it lol. 

Here is the vid.

I&#39;ll upload codes + objects\landscape ect when I have some more time, gotta get back to some music and theory. No fun...</description>

              <p>yes it does save their progression, and no its noobscape. I use what yong min releases because he has been guiding me through the learning process of coding. I am not the greatest but its coming along fairly well. Also, thanks for the compliments on the barrows. I’m gonna be up all night working on school work so I cannot upload the coding tonight, but when I have time i will. if you guys see any tips that could make it easier or to add to it that would be great. Also not that any rsc players will like this, but I made Rune enchanted armour, if you are wearing the 4 piece set your damage is increased. The armour and weapon is weak until under 50% health. At that point the damage is increased by 20% for every 10% decreasement in health: Ultimately allowing you to hit 66 if you are under 10 health &amp; have 99 str and potted…</p>
<p>~ok sorry, thought you said rsce lol. Yeah yongs version of Easy rsc is what I use; I had a blond moment goin on, my bad.</p>

              <p>Firstly this should be in the minigame contest thread. Other then that I like the barrows, what source did you use? ERSC? Id like to know if you saved the players progression if they log out do they lose it?</p>
