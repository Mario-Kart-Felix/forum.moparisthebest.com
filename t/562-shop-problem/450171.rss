    <description>I can&#39;t seem to find the fix for this...here is an example.

Lets say I have a full free inventory. If I try to buy 50 of an item it won&#39;t work it will just tell me I don&#39;t have enough space in my inventory.

It also does that when I try to buy noted items.

Does anyone know where this is located at?</description>
