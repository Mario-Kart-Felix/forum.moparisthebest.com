    <title>Custom Item (WHIPS) Attack Styles - HELP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-item-whips-attack-styles-help/426556</link>
    <description>Okay so I&#39;ve added a few custom whips, 5 different ones to be exact..
However, the attack styles are displaying as: Chop, slash, stab, block.

I&#39;m trying to get them to say: &#39;Flick, Lash, Deflect&#39; (As they are whips after all..)

[code]
Sidebar0c(12298, 12299, 12300,&quot;Flick&quot;, &quot;Lash&quot;, &quot;Deflect&quot;, 44, 75, 127, 75, 36, 128, 40, 50, 40, 103, 122, 50, tda);
	   Sidebar0d(12301, 12315, &quot;Flick&quot;, &quot;Lash&quot;, &quot;Deflect&quot;, 44, 75, 127, 75, 36, 128, 40, 50, 40, 103, 122, 50, tda);
[/code]

There is my current code in RSInterface.java in my Client folder.

But.. for some strange reason.. I get that silly &#39;unable to load ____Scape&#39; (With the black background and yellow and white writing on).. Which says 
&#39;Try rebooting your computer&#39;
&#39;Try closing some programs or windows&#39;
&#39;Try clearing your cache&#39; &amp; some other random stuff I can&#39;t remember.. 


Any ideas? :/


EDIT:

Solved the problem now, was due to this:
(For those that are interested)
[b][i]
ItemAssistant.java[/i][/b]
[code=java]
		} else if (WeaponName.startsWith(&quot;Abyssal&quot;)) {
			c.setSidebarInterface(0, 12290); //flick, lash, deflect
			c.getPA().sendFrame246(12291, 200, Weapon);
			c.getPA().sendFrame126(WeaponName, 12293);
[/code]

My custom items were named &#39;blue whip&#39; &#39;green whip&#39; &#39;white whip&#39; &#39;yellow whip&#39; &#39;Casey&#39;s whip&#39;.

Take note of the first line of code from above:
 [code] } else if (WeaponName.startsWith(&quot;Abyssal&quot;)) { [/code]

.. Pretty simple but took me ages to figure out as I kept searching for &#39;4151&#39; (Whip Item ID) and &#39;Whip&#39;.. And after 4 hours of searching.. found out it&#39;s under &#39;Abyssal&#39;...

Anyway, key thing to note from the first line of code is that it is telling everything after the &#39;{&#39; to apply to whatever Weapon Name STARTS with &#39;Abyssal&#39;.. 

Simply change the code to (or add underneath the old code):
[code=java]
		} else if (WeaponName.endsWith(&quot;Whip&quot;)) {
			c.setSidebarInterface(0, 12290); //flick, lash, deflect
			c.getPA().sendFrame246(12291, 200, Weapon);
			c.getPA().sendFrame126(WeaponName, 12293);
[/code]

And as long as your item name ends with &#39;Whip&#39; it will show the &#39;FLICK&#39; &#39;LASH&#39; &amp; &#39;DEFLECT&#39; attack style options, rather than the old CHOP/SLASH/LUNGE/BLOCK.</description>
