    <description>Is your child a computer hacker?

http://www.adequacy.org/stories/2001.12.2.42056.2147.html

Read it, it&#39;s so funny. It starts out kind of making sense and then goes totally nuts. Starts saying Linux is an &quot;illegal hacker operation system&quot; lol and talks about hackers dressing like emos with bright pink spiked up hair. And the really funny thing is that people actually believe him. Enjoy the article.</description>

<li>How much time does your child spend using the computer each day?</li>
</ol>
<p>If your son spends more than thirty minutes each day on the computer, he may be using it to DOS other peoples sites. DOSing involves gaining access to the “command prompt” on other people’s machines, and using it to tie up vital internet services. This can take up to eight hours. If your son is doing this, he is breaking the law, and you should stop him immediately. The safest policy is to limit your children’s access to the computer to a maximum of forty-five minutes each day.</p>
<p>what a fucking loswer, if your on a computer for 30 mins it means your hacking omofmomgommomfog!#$@!! wow…</p>

              <p>“If your son has requested a new “processor” from a company called “AMD”, this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, “knock-off” copies of American processor chips.”</p>
<p>That one made me laugh.</p>
<p>“Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers.”</p>
<p>He lets his teenanger witch is probally &lt;16 play an 18 rated game? Do I need to say more??!</p>
<p>“Your son may try to install “lunix” on your hard drive. If he is careful, you may not notice its presence, however, lunix is a capricious beast, and if handled incorrectly, your son may damage your computer, and even break it completely by deleting Windows, at which point you will have to have your computer repaired by a professional.”</p>
<p>Ok, he’s cleaver I give you that. Atleast he could do is SPELL LINUX correctly. Also, you do not need to be a professional to install windows xp. My 10 year old brother did it on his pc and I only found out when he asked me to activate it(30 days where up). He stole my cd. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>“They may take to carrying “glow-sticks” and some wear pacifiers around their necks. (I have no idea why they do this)”</p>
<p>I doubt anyone in there right(or wrong mind for that matter) would do this.</p>
<p>Overall, this guy is a complete idiot. He says he may be concerned about his son failing grades when if he can’t even research correctly. This NEEDS to be a joke or all humanity is doomed.</p>

              <blockquote>"If your son has undergone a sudden change in his style of dress, you may have a hacker on your hands. Hackers tend to dress in bright, day-glo colors. They may wear baggy pants, bright colored shirts and spiky hair dyed in bright colors to match their clothes. They may take to carrying "glow-sticks" and some wear pacifiers around their necks. (I have no idea why they do this) There are many such hackers in schools today, and your son may have started to associate with them. If you notice that your son's group of friends includes people dressed like this, it is time to think about a severe curfew, to protect him from dangerous influences."</blockquote>
<p>rofl someone has seen the movie “hackers”</p>
<p>which has not alot to do with hacking</p>

<p>The Software you didn’t reconise “Comet Cursor”, “Bonzi Buddy” and “Flash”. These Are Comet Cusor - Is a cusor modification tool - Not hacking, Bonzai Buddy Is a Desktop Freind, and Flash is a Web authoring/presentation tool None of these have to do with hacking.</p>

8.1 It’s based on a commersial O/S used by MOST LARGE CORPERATIONS call “UNIX”<br>
8.2 Linux is easy to remove off HD partitions with out taking the machine back to the vendors<br>
8.3 It’s A commercial O/S and using it could give him a Boost in the future job market<br>

<li>
<p>The reason that your son could be struggling could be any number of reasons A. Dyslexia| B. Not doing home work| C. Being Dim<br>
Any of these explain it better that radition because by your standards most hackers would be idiots. They are quite the opposite and Exetreemly clever and intelligent many of them being extreemly good at maths, cryptograpy.</p>

<p>ANYONE WHO FOLLOWS THIS MAN’S ADVICE IS GOING TO ALIENATE THEIR SON AND FAMILY. AND RUIN ANY CHANCE THEIR SON/DAUGHTER HAS IN THE IT INDUSTRIE.</p>

<p>Read it, it’s so funny. It starts out kind of making sense and then goes totally nuts.
