    <description>Okay, so, my server will be an economical one, but, there&#39;s a 10 million GP starter, along with 2000 sharks, and, I was wondering, does anyone know how to add a timer? So that, upon logging in, you must have at least 60 minutes of game time, to be able to trade &amp; drop, and 30 minutes of game time to be able to attack PLAYERS?

I thought it was something like &lt;blockquote&gt;actionInterval &gt; 60000) {&lt;/blockquote&gt; Or something, but I can&#39;t remember the code, will rep++</description>
