    <description>hello Moparscape i am here to advertise my server that i think deserves to be popular because of all the work ive put into it and all the people helping me. my server name is GolemXScape and its a great allstar based rsps i have already some player and staff, we need 1 admin. please help our economy out and our community by joining us. personally i love allstar and oldschool rsps because they have cool things to do on them and it reminds me of the day when runescape was ACTUALLY GOOD? so this server GolemXScape has been coded lots and i dont wanna say how hard it was to code all of it because i have worked so much on coding it and we have 15 players already. join our forums and talk with us in the chatbox. help us get bigger and enjoy
