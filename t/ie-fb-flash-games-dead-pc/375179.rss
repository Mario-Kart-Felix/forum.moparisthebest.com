    <title>Ie + fb flash games = dead pc?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ie-fb-flash-games-dead-pc/375179</link>
    <description>omg. i came to the computer my mom was on--playing farmville or another one of those fb flash games. to open a new tab to check another site. the computer was like froze and i was like wtf. opened taskman and chrome. looked at taskman ie had 450k+ of ram, and 50% cpu. i was like that is way way too much memory to be using. ok this wasnt really a question, but why in the world would one of those games require that much of the computers resources? sorry no pic. this was on a pc with 1 gig of ram and athlon 64 2x 3800+ cpu. but im probably going to do some work on this pc anyways.</description>

              <p>i prefer chrome. and am aware of the working of windows and other OSs. i am in college for programming–was aware b4 college too. on that pc that this occurred they had chrome my mom just didnt open it–didnt see it. and the swap file was already increased to 1.5x the ram. but that info may help someone that didnt know.</p>

Btw, Opera has bugs… Cant save files just play tham up or open.<br>
Flash takes alot on the computer RAM (Random Access Memory) try (if you dont got) get a/the swappingfile (bigger), its making the computer performance faster and minimizing the crashes as when the computer freezes, and the computer is out of RAM, it uses the swapfile, the swapfile is a type of a memory just as RAM, find more on Google =) Hope this helped!! =D =D.</p>

              <p>Yeah, some system processes may slow it down. For whatever reason, one of the svchost.exe processes (svchost.exe(LocalServiceAndNoImpersonation)) used 92% of my CPU, so I need to suspend it every time I start up my computer.</p>

              <p>well ill check how much my laptop uses. but runescape doesnt use that much memory last time i seen how much memory rs used was around 250k–if i remember right. my laptop has 4 gb of ddr3 and i3-330m cpu so it takes a little bit more to slow mine down. but i dont like the flash games on fb. but im going to look at more processes now to see whats going on.</p>
