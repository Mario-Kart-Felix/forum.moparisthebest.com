    <title>Dead tree wood cutter and banker</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dead-tree-wood-cutter-and-banker/38275</link>
    <description>like the dead trees at draynor mansion then go bank them, i just want noob chars to do this, so antirandoms are not needed. I dont want something that will click on the exact color cuz that is too detectable. some color variablitlity will be helpfull, also a code that will use the roads to walk back if it dies. also if it is teleported to a unknown place it will attempt to use home teleport to go back to lumby. Thankyou for your efforts.</description>
