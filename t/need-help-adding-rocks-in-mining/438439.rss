    <description>Hello Moparscape,

I will try give you as much information as I can on my problem;

I am trying to add new mining rocks (Copper, Tin, Coal, etc) in Varrock Centre.

I am using a Teamtorva Source which is i think [PI] (Tell me if it isn&#39;t)

I dont have MakeGlobalObject in my client.java but last time i added bank booths i used ObjectManager.java to add them but when i try with Rocks and that they dont appear.

If you need more information just say...And i can also allow you on my teamviewer if you sound like you know and want to see :)</description>
