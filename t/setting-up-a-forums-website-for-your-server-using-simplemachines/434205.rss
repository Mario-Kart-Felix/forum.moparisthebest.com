    <title>Setting up a Forums/Website for Your Server Using SimpleMachines</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-up-a-forums-website-for-your-server-using-simplemachines/434205</link>
    <description>Generally SimpleMachines forum is one of the best of all open source forum websites. This forum that you&#39;re on right now (Moparscape) uses SimpleMachines forum. If you go to the bottom (footer) of the website you&#39;ll see, &quot;SMF Â© 2011, Simple Machines&quot; along with the copyright information. So if Moparscape uses it for their forums, you know its going to be a pretty decent forum. I&#39;ll be going over front to back how to get your servers website up and ready (Including links to webclient directions) i&#39;ll go over getting the open source software, installing it, getting new themes that fit your styles, getting the most common and good mods, and how to add custom pages. So enough with this talking, lets get started.

III. Installing SimpleMachines
IV. Customizing Your Forums
IV-I. Changing the Theme
IV-II. Adding Custom Pages

[size=18pt][b]I. Downloading the Files[/b][/size]
Of course if you want to run Simple Machines, you&#39;re going to need to download it first hand, you can download it from [url=http://download.simplemachines.org/index.php?thanks;filename=smf_2-0-2_install.zip]http://download.simplemachines.org/index.php?thanks;filename=smf_2-0-2_install.zip[/url] It will download it as a &#39;.zip&#39; file, you&#39;ll need win-rar or 7zip to open the file,
Win-rar: [url=http://www.win-rar.com/download.html]www.win-rar.com/download.html[/url]
7zip: [url=http://www.7-zip.org/download.html]http://www.7-zip.org/download.html[/url]
After you&#39;ve downloaded the files, go onto step II of the tutorial, where you upload the files to your web host, or your computer.

[size=18pt][b]II. Uploading the Files[/b][/size]
After you&#39;ve got them downloaded by following the previous step in the tutorial, you should have a .zip file that you&#39;ll need to open, make sure the files is called, &quot;smf_2-0-2_install.zip&quot; (Most recent version). After you have it, you can choose to either upload to your webhost, or if you want to upload it to your computer, though you&#39;ll need XAMPP on your computer or Apache, MySQL, PhpMyAdmin, and PHP installed. Read section II-I to view instructions on how to upload it directly to your web host, or section II-II to upload it to your localhost (not recommended). 

[size=18pt][b]II-I. Uploading the Files: Webhost[/b][/size]
If you&#39;ve recently purchased a website domain or host, you&#39;ll be able to start uploading files to them, i would recommend setting up an FTP account and using Filezilla to upload your files. That&#39;s the way that i&#39;ll be going over on how to do so. I&#39;m going to be using an Arvixe Control Panel (Purchased Domain from Arvixe) to go through on how to create an FTP account, although all webhosting control panels are different, this is the general way that it is done.

Step 1: First off while you&#39;re in your web control panel you&#39;ll need to select &quot;FTP Accounts&quot; As shown in the picture below:

[IMG]http://i43.tinypic.com/14ne51l.png[/img]

Afterwards, you&#39;ll be presented with a screen like the one below, just fill out the information and make sure you write it down somewhere or keep it memorized.

[IMG]http://i41.tinypic.com/2hcja0m.png[/img]

Make sure that you have the directory that the FTP account is associated to as the root directory, where the main files are from.
After you&#39;re done with creating the FTP account, you&#39;ll want to upload the files, you can use the webhost provided uploader (not recommended) or you can use FileZilla FTP Client. I would highly recommend Filezilla because it is much more fast, and will have the files uploaded in just a few minutes. Download Filezilla from here: [url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/files/FileZilla_Client/3.5.3/FileZilla_3.5.3_win32-setup.exe/download]http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/files/FileZilla_Client/3.5.3/FileZilla_3.5.3_win32-setup.exe/download[/url] After you&#39;ve installed and ran filezilla you&#39;ll see a window with four fields that are labeled, &quot;Host&quot; , &quot;Username&quot; , &quot;Password&quot; , &quot;Port&quot;. Fill these out with this information:

Host: http://yourwebsite.com
Username: Username that you created the FTP account with, should be WHATYOUENTERED@yourwebsite.com
Password: The password that you used to create the FTP Account
Port: 21

Then go ahead and click &quot;Quickconnect&quot; After you&#39;re connected to the website with your FTP account through your computer, you can drag and drop the files from the SimpleMachines &#39;.zip&#39; file that you downloaded, directly drag and drop them from win-rar to filezilla, it will extract from winrar and then start to upload it. After you&#39;ve gotten it done, move on to the next step, &quot;Installing SMF&quot;.

[size=18pt][b]II-II. Uploading Files: Localhost[/b][/size]
If you are running your server website from your personal computer, which is not recommended, but some do, if you&#39;re one of those people and you have XAMPP installed already, go to &#39;My Computer &gt; C:/ &gt; Xampp &gt; htdocs&#39; and drag and drop the files to that directory/folder, directly from win-rar.

After you have uploaded them to your htdocs folder, its now time to install it, move on to the next step in the tutorial for this part.

[size=18pt][b]III. Installing SimpleMachines[/b][/size]
This is the main part of the set-up process, installing it. If you go to your website you&#39;ll be presented with a window like this:

[IMG]http://i43.tinypic.com/2lifluq.png[/img]

Click continue to start the set-up process, before you do all of this you&#39;ll need to set-up a database for your website&#39;s files, if you haven&#39;t done so already, go to http://yourwebsite.com/phpmyadmin or http://localhost/phpmyadmin .. Sometimes you&#39;ll need to go to it through your control panel. When you&#39;re in phpmyadmin, log-in with the username &#39;root&#39; and the password as &#39;password&#39; these are the default log-in credentials unless you have set your own. Now that you&#39;re in type in as database name, &quot;Website&quot; and click &quot;Create&quot;

http://i40.tinypic.com/2vbjtbp.png

Now we&#39;re done with phpmyadmin for a bit, lets go back to the setup process, after clicking &#39;Continue&#39; You&#39;ll be presented with a window like the one below, just fill out the information that you see on the picture below and click &#39;Continue&#39;

[IMG]http://i41.tinypic.com/1z5838y.png[/img]

Now on the next screen all you really need to change is the, &#39;Forum Name&#39; then click Continue to move on.

[IMG]http://i41.tinypic.com/2ms0jzr.png[/img]

Now after you click continue, you may experience some lag time, this is because the setup process is setting up Tables and Rows, along with some initial data, If it worked successfully, you&#39;ll be presented with a window like the one below, the next step is setting up the administrator account (your account).

[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/riajrn.png[/img]

This next part is pretty self explanatory, you really can put whatever you want here, but make sure that you memorize whatever you put in here, because you&#39;ll need it to log-in at a later point. Database password is the same that its always been, once again, by default it should be, &#39;password&#39; .

[IMG]http://i41.tinypic.com/vq65wm.png[/img]

On the next window you should see, &#39;[size=14pt]Congratulations, the installation process is complete![/size]&#39;
You&#39;re going to want to check the box that says, &#39;[b]Click here to delete this install.php file now. (doesn&#39;t work on all servers.)[/b]&#39; Just to delete the install.php file seeing as it is not needed, then click the link that says, &#39;your newly installed forum&#39; on the line below it and you will be redirected to your website. Below is a picture of your default website and what it should look like after you have installed it, i&#39;ve put red boxes around some important key elements on the website. Now go to the next section that is customizing your forums on information how to change it up a bit and make it suited for your server.

[IMG]http://i44.tinypic.com/2vcb139.png[/img]

[size=18pt][b]IV. Customizing Your Forums[/b][/size]
This is going to be broken up into different sections, depending on what you want to do, this section is going to have its own table of contents, just to organize things.

Table of Contents
IV-I. Changing the Theme

[size=18pt][b]IV-I. Changing the Theme[/b][/size]
This is probably one of the easiest things to do with your website, simple go here and select what theme you want, to start. And download the theme and open it with Win-rar, link: [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/themes/index.php?action=search;version[]=68]http://custom.simplemachines.org/themes/index.php?action=search;version[]=68[/url]

Find a theme that you&#39;d like and open it using Win-rar, I&#39;m using the, &#39;2O11&#39; theme for these instructions, because i personally like the theme itself, when you have win-rar open you&#39;ll want to upload the theme to your website, whether you&#39;re uploading it to localhost, or your webhost, you need to upload it to the &#39;Themes&#39; folder, what should be in the root directory of your website. If your website comes with multiple files and not a folder (in the win-rar) you&#39;ll need to create a folder in the &#39;Themes&#39; directory of the site, called the theme name, or whatever you want. (See picture below)

[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/2rc3n8w.png[/img]

After you have the files in the correct folder, go to your website and click &#39;admin&#39; at the top and then roll your mouse over, &#39;Configuration&#39; and click &#39;Themes And Layout..&#39; From here, scroll down to where you see, &#39;Install a New Theme&#39; and where you see, &quot;From a directory on the server&quot; type in, &quot;C:\xampp\htdocs\themes\THEMEFOLDER&quot; or &quot;http://yourwebsite.com\Themes\THEMEFOLDER&quot; Obviously, replace, &#39;THEMEFOLDER&#39; with the folder for your theme, mine in this case is 2O11. Then click Install! Afterwards, go back to &#39;Manage and Install&#39; and from the dropdown for, &quot;Overall forum default&quot; Select your new theme. Then click, &#39;Save&#39; and your new theme will now show.

[IMG]http://i41.tinypic.com/vi6wo.png[/img]

[size=18pt][b]IV-II. Adding Custom Pages[/b][/size]
This is one part in creating a website that a lot of people want to do, Mainly for adding Staff lists, webclient pages, and other things. I used some of my custom PHP code to create what we&#39;re going to do and make a work around, there are going to be a few files that we&#39;re going to be editing, index.php and &#39;Sources &gt; Subs.php&#39;, Lets start by opening index.php

Hit Ctrl + f and search for, &#39;xmlhttp&#39; you should see a line of code that looks like this:
[code]		&#39;xmlhttp&#39; =&gt; array(&#39;Xml.php&#39;, &#39;XMLhttpMain&#39;),[/code]

Start on a new line and add this right below it:
[code]		&#39;play&#39; =&gt; array(&#39;play.php&#39;, &#39;Play&#39;),[/code]

Then save this file and we&#39;re going to be moving on to the Subs.php that can be found in the &#39;Sources&#39; folder.
Once again, do ctrl + f and search for &#39;help&#39; you should see something like this:
[code]
&#39;help&#39; =&gt; array(
				&#39;title&#39; =&gt; $txt[&#39;help&#39;],
				&#39;href&#39; =&gt; $scripturl . &#39;?action=help&#39;,
				&#39;show&#39; =&gt; true,
				&#39;sub_buttons&#39; =&gt; array(
				),
			),
[/code]

After the last ), we want to add this:
[code]			&#39;play&#39; =&gt; array(
				&#39;title&#39; =&gt; &#39;Play&#39;,
				&#39;href&#39; =&gt; &#39;?action=play&#39;,
				&#39;show&#39; =&gt; true,
				),[/code]

You can now save Subs.php and close out of it, there is one more thing that we have to do, and that&#39;s creating the actual play page, to do this, you need to copy the code below and paste it and save it as &#39;play.php&#39; in the &#39;Sources&#39; folder on your website.
[code]&lt;?php

if (!defined(&#39;SMF&#39;))
die(&#39;You are not on the forum!&#39;);

function Play() {
    global $context;
    $context[&#39;page_title&#39;] = &#39;Play&#39;;

    function template_main() {
		echo &#39;PASTE THE WEBCLIENT CODE HERE!&#39;;
    }
    
}

?&gt;[/code] 

Where you see, &#39;PASTE THE WEBCLIENT CODE HERE!&#39; delete that and replace it with the code for your webclient, when you&#39;re done you should see the new page, as shown below.

[b][size=14pt]Thanks for reading this tutorial i hope you all enjoy it, if you have ANY problem with setting up these forums or have a question with them, let me know. I&#39;ll be changing some things and updating stuff some more later on, and posting and &quot;error section&quot; for those who are having problems with this.[/size][/b]</description>

If you go to the bottom (footer) of the website youâll see, âSMF Â© 2011, Simple Machinesâ along with the copyright information.

After youâve got them downloaded by following the previous step in the tutorial, you should have a .zip file that youâll need to open, make sure the files is called, âsmf_2-0-2_install.zipâ (Most recent version). After you have it, you can choose to either upload to your webhost, or if you want to upload it to your computer, though youâll need XAMPP on your computer or Apache, MySQL, PhpMyAdmin, and PHP installed. Read section II-I to view instructions on how to upload it directly to your web host, or section II-II to upload it to your localhost (not recommended).</p>
<p>[size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-b">II-I. Uploading the Files: Webhost</span>[/size]<br>
If youâve recently purchased a website domain or host, youâll be able to start uploading files to them, i would recommend setting up an FTP account and using Filezilla to upload your files. Thatâs the way that iâll be going over on how to do so. Iâm going to be using an Arvixe Control Panel (Purchased Domain from Arvixe) to go through on how to create an FTP account, although all webhosting control panels are different, this is the general way that it is done.</p>
<p>Step 1: First off while youâre in your web control panel youâll need to select âFTP Accountsâ As shown in the picture below:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i43.tinypic.com/14ne51l.png" title="14ne51l.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/14ne51l.png" alt width="690" height="402"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">14ne51l.png</span><span class="informations">856Ã499</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Afterwards, youâll be presented with a screen like the one below, just fill out the information and make sure you write it down somewhere or keep it memorized.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i41.tinypic.com/2hcja0m.png" title="2hcja0m.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/2hcja0m.png" alt width="690" height="457"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">2hcja0m.png</span><span class="informations">860Ã570</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Make sure that you have the directory that the FTP account is associated to as the root directory, where the main files are from.<br>
After youâre done with creating the FTP account, youâll want to upload the files, you can use the webhost provided uploader (not recommended) or you can use FileZilla FTP Client. I would highly recommend Filezilla because it is much more fast, and will have the files uploaded in just a few minutes. Download Filezilla from here: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/files/FileZilla_Client/3.5.3/FileZilla_3.5.3_win32-setup.exe/download" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/files/FileZilla_Client/3.5.3/FileZilla_3.5.3_win32-setup.exe/download</a> After youâve installed and ran filezilla youâll see a window with four fields that are labeled, âHostâ , âUsernameâ , âPasswordâ , âPortâ. Fill these out with this information:</p>
<p>Host: <a href="http://yourwebsite.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://yourwebsite.com</a><br>
Username: Username that you created the FTP account with, should be <a href="mailto:WHATYOUENTERED@yourwebsite.com">WHATYOUENTERED@yourwebsite.com</a><br>
Password: The password that you used to create the FTP Account<br>
Port: 21</p>
<p>Then go ahead and click âQuickconnectâ After youâre connected to the website with your FTP account through your computer, you can drag and drop the files from the SimpleMachines â.zipâ file that you downloaded, directly drag and drop them from win-rar to filezilla, it will extract from winrar and then start to upload it. After youâve gotten it done, move on to the next step, âInstalling SMFâ.</p>
<p>[size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-b">II-II. Uploading Files: Localhost</span>[/size]<br>
If you are running your server website from your personal computer, which is not recommended, but some do, if youâre one of those people and you have XAMPP installed already, go to âMy Computer &gt; C:/ &gt; Xampp &gt; htdocsâ and drag and drop the files to that directory/folder, directly from win-rar.</p>
<p>After you have uploaded them to your htdocs folder, its now time to install it, move on to the next step in the tutorial for this part.</p>
<p>[size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-b">III. Installing SimpleMachines</span>[/size]<br>
This is the main part of the set-up process, installing it. If you go to your website youâll be presented with a window like this:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i43.tinypic.com/2lifluq.png" title="2lifluq.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/2lifluq.png" alt width="690" height="311"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">2lifluq.png</span><span class="informations">1319Ã596</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Click continue to start the set-up process, before you do all of this youâll need to set-up a database for your websiteâs files, if you havenât done so already, go to <a href="http://yourwebsite.com/phpmyadmin" rel="nofollow noopener">http://yourwebsite.com/phpmyadmin</a> or <a href="http://localhost/phpmyadmin" rel="nofollow noopener">http://localhost/phpmyadmin</a> â¦ Sometimes youâll need to go to it through your control panel. When youâre in phpmyadmin, log-in with the username ârootâ and the password as âpasswordâ these are the default log-in credentials unless you have set your own. Now that youâre in type in as database name, âWebsiteâ and click âCreateâ</p>
<p>          <a href="http://i40.tinypic.com/2vbjtbp.png" target="_blank" class="onebox" rel="nofollow noopener">
            <img src="http://i40.tinypic.com/2vbjtbp.png" width="690" height="375">
          </a>
</p>
<p>Now weâre done with phpmyadmin for a bit, lets go back to the setup process, after clicking âContinueâ Youâll be presented with a window like the one below, just fill out the information that you see on the picture below and click âContinueâ</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i41.tinypic.com/1z5838y.png" title="1z5838y.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/1z5838y.png" alt width="690" height="411"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">1z5838y.png</span><span class="informations">1294Ã771</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Now on the next screen all you really need to change is the, âForum Nameâ then click Continue to move on.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i41.tinypic.com/2ms0jzr.png" title="2ms0jzr.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/2ms0jzr.png" alt width="690" height="264"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">2ms0jzr.png</span><span class="informations">1180Ã453</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Now after you click continue, you may experience some lag time, this is because the setup process is setting up Tables and Rows, along with some initial data, If it worked successfully, youâll be presented with a window like the one below, the next step is setting up the administrator account (your account).</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i39.tinypic.com/riajrn.png" title="riajrn.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/riajrn.png" alt width="690" height="107"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>
<p>This next part is pretty self explanatory, you really can put whatever you want here, but make sure that you memorize whatever you put in here, because youâll need it to log-in at a later point. Database password is the same that its always been, once again, by default it should be, âpasswordâ .</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i41.tinypic.com/vq65wm.png" title="vq65wm.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/vq65wm.png" alt width="689" height="273"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">vq65wm.png</span><span class="informations">1194Ã473</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>On the next window you should see, â[size=14pt]Congratulations, the installation process is complete![/size]â<br>
Youâre going to want to check the box that says, â<span class="bbcode-b">Click here to delete this install.php file now. (doesnât work on all servers.)</span>â Just to delete the install.php file seeing as it is not needed, then click the link that says, âyour newly installed forumâ on the line below it and you will be redirected to your website. Below is a picture of your default website and what it should look like after you have installed it, iâve put red boxes around some important key elements on the website. Now go to the next section that is customizing your forums on information how to change it up a bit and make it suited for your server.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i44.tinypic.com/2vcb139.png" title="2vcb139.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i44.tinypic.com/2vcb139.png" alt width="690" height="386"><div class="meta">

<p>[size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-b">IV. Customizing Your Forums</span>[/size]<br>
This is going to be broken up into different sections, depending on what you want to do, this section is going to have its own table of contents, just to organize things.</p>
<p>Table of Contents<br>
IV-I. Changing the Theme</p>
<p>[size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-b">IV-I. Changing the Theme</span>[/size]<br>
This is probably one of the easiest things to do with your website, simple go here and select what theme you want, to start. And download the theme and open it with Win-rar, link: <a href="http://custom.simplemachines.org/themes/index.php?action=search;version%5B" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">=68]http://custom.simplemachines.org/themes/index.php?action=search;version[]=68</a></p>
<p>Find a theme that youâd like and open it using Win-rar, Iâm using the, â2O11â theme for these instructions, because i personally like the theme itself, when you have win-rar open youâll want to upload the theme to your website, whether youâre uploading it to localhost, or your webhost, you need to upload it to the âThemesâ folder, what should be in the root directory of your website. If your website comes with multiple files and not a folder (in the win-rar) youâll need to create a folder in the âThemesâ directory of the site, called the theme name, or whatever you want. (See picture below)</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i39.tinypic.com/2rc3n8w.png" title="2rc3n8w.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/2rc3n8w.png" alt width="690" height="394"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">2rc3n8w.png</span><span class="informations">958Ã548</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>After you have the files in the correct folder, go to your website and click âadminâ at the top and then roll your mouse over, âConfigurationâ and click âThemes And Layoutâ¦â From here, scroll down to where you see, âInstall a New Themeâ and where you see, âFrom a directory on the serverâ type in, âC:\xampp\htdocs\themes\THEMEFOLDERâ or â<a href="http://yourwebsite.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://yourwebsite.com</a>\Themes\THEMEFOLDERâ Obviously, replace, âTHEMEFOLDERâ with the folder for your theme, mine in this case is 2O11. Then click Install! Afterwards, go back to âManage and Installâ and from the dropdown for, âOverall forum defaultâ Select your new theme. Then click, âSaveâ and your new theme will now show.</p>

<p>[size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-b">IV-II. Adding Custom Pages</span>[/size]<br>
This is one part in creating a website that a lot of people want to do, Mainly for adding Staff lists, webclient pages, and other things. I used some of my custom PHP code to create what weâre going to do and make a work around, there are going to be a few files that weâre going to be editing, index.php and âSources &gt; Subs.phpâ, Lets start by opening index.php</p>
<p>Hit Ctrl + f and search for, âxmlhttpâ you should see a line of code that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		'xmlhttp' =&gt; array('Xml.php', 'XMLhttpMain'),</code></pre>
<p>Start on a new line and add this right below it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		'play' =&gt; array('play.php', 'Play'),</code></pre>
<p>Then save this file and weâre going to be moving on to the Subs.php that can be found in the âSourcesâ folder.<br>
Once again, do ctrl + f and search for âhelpâ you should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">'help' =&gt; array(
				'title' =&gt; $txt['help'],
				'href' =&gt; $scripturl . '?action=help',
				'show' =&gt; true,
				'sub_buttons' =&gt; array(
				),
			),</code></pre>
<p>After the last ), we want to add this:</p>
<p><code>			'play' =&gt; array(
				'title' =&gt; 'Play',
				'href' =&gt; '?action=play',
				'show' =&gt; true,
				),</code></p>
<p>You can now save Subs.php and close out of it, there is one more thing that we have to do, and thatâs creating the actual play page, to do this, you need to copy the code below and paste it and save it as âplay.phpâ in the âSourcesâ folder on your website.</p>
<p>[code]&lt;?php</p>
<p>if (!defined(âSMFâ))<br>
die(âYou are not on the forum!â);</p>
<p>function Play() {<br>
global $context;<br>
$context[âpage_titleâ] = âPlayâ;</p>
<pre><code>function template_main() {
	echo 'PASTE THE WEBCLIENT CODE HERE!';
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]</p>
<p>Where you see, âPASTE THE WEBCLIENT CODE HERE!â delete that and replace it with the code for your webclient, when youâre done you should see the new page, as shown below.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i42.tinypic.com/38mfp.png" title="38mfp.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i42.tinypic.com/38mfp.png" alt width="690" height="242"><div class="meta">

<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=14pt]Thanks for reading this tutorial i hope you all enjoy it, if you have ANY problem with setting up these forums or have a question with them, let me know.
