    <title>Need to get some things straight involving World War I</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-to-get-some-things-straight-involving-world-war-i/269202</link>
    <description>Hmm, I have to write an essay on World War I, what I&#39;m trying to work out is who [u]really[/u] won, the Allies or the Axis? My great, great Grandfather (I believe) was a Captain of a battalion in the Australian Army, and his story has been passed down my family. From what I can gather, the U.S seems to believe &quot;we won the war for you.&quot; But, from what I can read and gather, the U.S got involved towards the end of the war, and never supplied any artilary, aircraft, tanks, etc anything that added to the aid of the Allies. 

I know officially the Allies won the war, but the Axis killed more Allies than the Allies did to the Axis, and from what I can gather, the Axis surrendered because they were fearing the Allies had more supplies after the 3 years of fighting.</description>

              <p>World War I consisted of the Triple Entente, and the Triple Alliance. You’re thinking of World War II when you say “Allies and Axis.”</p>
<p>You have to remember, the U.S. is full of a ton of ignorant people who believe “we do everything right, and win everything.” They also didn’t enter into the war as a direct ally to France and Britain. They wanted to take it upon themselves to wage war against Germany because they violated the American’s neutrality.</p>
<p>The Canadian forces, as well as the Australian forces were under British command, but I’m sure you know that.</p>
<p>But I’m assuming you now mean which <span class="bbcode-b">nation</span> actually won… This is rather hard to discuss, as Germany was doing a good job, until the fresh American forces stepped in. I wouldn’t go as far as to say America won the war, but they did do quite a bit for the little time they were there. All in all, I believe Britain won. They were in the war the whole time, and aren’t french.</p>

              <p>I blame the Belgians for not stepping aside.</p>
<p>On a more serious note: I’ve forgotten quite a lot about WWI, while history was my favorite subject and we’ve talked about WWI a lot in class. But I do think that the allies are to blame when it comes to WWII. They pushed a humiliating, unrealistic treaty down Germany’s throat.</p>
<p>I don’t believe that the Allies won the war because they were better. The German Revolution is the reason Germany didn’t want to continue.</p>

              <p>Doesn’t matter how many people were killed, the fact is that if Germany had not signed the Treaty of Versailles we would of just invaded them and probably have made it a lot better. US didn’t really do a great deal, but did set up the League of Nations, which I suppose helped to lead on to better things, but even then, the LoN didn’t really succeed, and had a lot of failures.</p>
