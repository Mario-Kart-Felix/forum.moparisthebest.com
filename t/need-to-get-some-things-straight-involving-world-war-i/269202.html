<p>I know officially the Allies won the war, but the Axis killed more Allies than the Allies did to the Axis, and from what I can gather, the Axis surrendered because they were fearing the Allies had more supplies after the 3 years of fighting.</p>

        <p>Doesn’t matter how many people were killed, the fact is that if Germany had not signed the Treaty of Versailles we would of just invaded them and probably have made it a lot better. US didn’t really do a great deal, but did set up the League of Nations, which I suppose helped to lead on to better things, but even then, the LoN didn’t really succeed, and had a lot of failures.</p>

        <p>I blame the Belgians for not stepping aside.</p>
<p>On a more serious note: I’ve forgotten quite a lot about WWI, while history was my favorite subject and we’ve talked about WWI a lot in class. But I do think that the allies are to blame when it comes to WWII. They pushed a humiliating, unrealistic treaty down Germany’s throat.</p>
<p>I don’t believe that the Allies won the war because they were better. The German Revolution is the reason Germany didn’t want to continue.</p>

        <p>World War I consisted of the Triple Entente, and the Triple Alliance. You’re thinking of World War II when you say “Allies and Axis.”</p>
<p>You have to remember, the U.S. is full of a ton of ignorant people who believe “we do everything right, and win everything.” They also didn’t enter into the war as a direct ally to France and Britain. They wanted to take it upon themselves to wage war against Germany because they violated the American’s neutrality.</p>
<p>The Canadian forces, as well as the Australian forces were under British command, but I’m sure you know that.</p>
<p>But I’m assuming you now mean which <span class="bbcode-b">nation</span> actually won… This is rather hard to discuss, as Germany was doing a good job, until the fresh American forces stepped in. I wouldn’t go as far as to say America won the war, but they did do quite a bit for the little time they were there. All in all, I believe Britain won. They were in the war the whole time, and aren’t french.</p>
