    <description>[url=http://www.rs2leveling.com/xclient.rar]http://www.rs2leveling.com/xclient.rar[/url] (XeonScape Client)

I am trying to use that client a base to my server, but I think there is an anti leech of some sort because I cannot compile to change anything, and because the client won&#39;t work. Because once, I only changed the EUGI to my server IP and logged in fine, next I try to change the name of it to my server name, and it doesn&#39;t work. I reunrar everything, change only IP, and it works again.. Change ONE name to my server name, and doesn&#39;t.

Anyone who can solve this, can have the option to recieve $15.</description>
