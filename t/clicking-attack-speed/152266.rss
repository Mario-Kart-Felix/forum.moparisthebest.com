    <title>Clicking Attack Speed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clicking-attack-speed/152266</link>
    <description>I have the part about attack speed down. But, I need it so that even if you click the oppenent 50 times fast, you still hit him at the same rate as if you click him once and then just keep attacking. 

Thanks,
