    <description>Hello, im currently creating a 718 Runescape Private Server. I&#39;m still working on some things but i&#39;ve run into some problems. I&#39;ve Jared my client recently but for some reason it won&#39;t work this time. I&#39;ve followed a video on youtube. I&#39;ve opened JarMaker, I created a folder on my desktop called Webclient and selected that as my output directory. I named my client ServerName.jar. After selecting my output directory I changed the input directory. My input directory was Desktop/Server/Webclient/Bin. My input was my BIN in the webclient folder. After doing these steps I create my Manifest Template. Since the server was 718 I put my Manifest to Loader. I then went into my client and opened Loader.java. I created a NO-IP and changed the 127.0.0.0 ip to my NO-IP address that I created. I checked my port forwarding and everything was done correctly. My port was set to 43594. After doing all of these steps I Jared the client and sent it to a friend through skype. He opened the webclient but all that was there was a screen saying &quot;Checking for updates 0%&quot; and it stayed there and never went up. Someone please reply to this and help me out. I do have skype and a working mic so if you&#39;d like to speak with me I can also do that.</description>
