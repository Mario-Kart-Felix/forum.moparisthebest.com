              <p>Like what Butchd12 said, make sure your cache is in the correct spot (C:). Also I find when I start the server before starting the client, the client doesnâ€™t come up with any of those errors.<br>
Yeah so just try starting the server first THEN client. ALSO! did you change the ip to 127.0.0.1? or 0.0.0.0?</p>

              <p>First off make sure that the cache is in the right spot, usually in the c: drive. and make sure the client is loading it in the right spot, same as before the c: drive</p>
