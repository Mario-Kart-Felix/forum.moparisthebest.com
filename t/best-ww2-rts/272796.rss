    <title>Best WW2 RTS?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-ww2-rts/272796</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking for a good WW2 RTS. With good I mean as realistic as possible. A game where strategy actually matters, where spam building one type of unit will mean defeat. A game where you can be Allies or Axis. I&#39;ve played Empire Earth, but I want to try something else.</description>
