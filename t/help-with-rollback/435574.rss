    <title>Help with rollback</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-rollback/435574</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I need help with a rollback. Me and Snake came to an agreement and he changed his house.
Im trying to roll back his old one but Hawk is being difficult.
I know the house is only a few weeks old and was built by a number of players, so just rolling back players radius isn&#39;t working.
I only know the the commands /hawk rollback p:xxx r:xx  and /hawk rollback p:xxx</description>

              <p>That should work, just be careful with radius, and if you go too far you can ‘/hawk undo’ I believe, but don’t count on it working.</p>

              <p>Just blow it up, much more fun  ;D</p>
<p>But considering he was in breach of the rules, shouldn’t you be able to do:</p>
<p>/hawk rollback r:50 t:5d</p>
<p>So it rolls back everyone who’s done anything within the radius/time specified?</p>
