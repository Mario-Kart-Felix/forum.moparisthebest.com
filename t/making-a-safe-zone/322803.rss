    <title>Making a safe zone</title>

    <description>[b]NOTE ~ This probably has been done so many times before, but i could not find a tut for this so i decided to make one.
[/b]

This is a tutorial on how to create a safe zone in your server. I used it when making a new home and skilling area.

[b]-STEP 1[/b]:

Open up client.java and search for this...
[code](((absX[/code]
~NOTE~ It might be easier searching for something like &quot;safezone&quot; or &quot;nonwild&quot;

ABSX means The X cord.
ABSY means the Y cord.




[b]-STEP 2:[/b]

Now you will hopefully see the safe zones for you&#39;re server. now add this in
[code]absX &gt;= (BLX) &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= (TRX) &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= (BLY) &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=(TRY) ) ||[/code]

You see the (BLX), (TRX), (BLY), and (TRY)?

Right basically when making the area a safe zone you have to imagine that its a square.

REPLACE (BLX) with the bottom left hand X cord.
REPLACE (TRX) with the top right X Cord.
REPLACE (BLY) with the bottom left hand Y cord.
REPLACE (TRY) with the top right Y cord.

Once you have all the cords for each corner of the square, the centre of it will be the safe zone 

[b]~EXAMPLE~[/b]
This is one set of cords i made for an example
[code]absX &gt;= 3249 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3258 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3438 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=3431 ) ||[/code]

Thanks for reading and i hope that it helped you like it would have helped me. :)

Please feedback if there is anything wrong thanks
