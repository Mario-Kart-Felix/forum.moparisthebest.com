    <description>i foloed a tutorial and i up to this




Open up player.java press ctrl + f and lookup

public int[] shop2

those are the shops and in the [] is the items they sell, change it around if
you want them to see diff items if you want to add a shop what you would do is
press enter after shop12

copy and paste this

public int[] shop13 = {};
public int[] shop13n = {};
public int[] shop13p = {};

just change the shop# if you want to keep adding shops, and put the item id you want the
shop to sell in the {}.

Next open up npcoption1 press ctrl + f and lookup if(pnp.npcType == 1552)

copy and paste this after the last } in that code

if(pnp.npcType == #)
{
p.viewings = 1;
p.shopid = #;
p.frames.showInterface(p, 278);
p.frames.setItems(p, 278, 89, 94, p.shop#, p.shop#n);
p.frames.setString(p, &quot;Name of shop&quot;, 278, 88);
}

ok in the pnp.npctype = # put the id of the npc there, so if u want a man to sell stuff
you would put 1 next. pshop id, put the shop# from player.java that you want the npc to sell
do that for p.frames.setitems in there too add the shop id #. 

Thats it just spawn the npc and compile!


i foloed it and i dont really understand this part         &quot;pshop id, put the shop# from player.java that you want the npc to sell
                                                                        do that for p.frames.setitems in there too add the shop id #. &quot;</description>
