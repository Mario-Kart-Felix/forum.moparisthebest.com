    <title>Fix defence in allstar source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fix-defence-in-allstar-source/524434</link>
    <description>While working on my allstar source I noticed that the defence stats on armour and the skill itself doesnt actually do anything. 
I&#39;ve heard that its a common allstar problem while researching it, but haven&#39;t been able to find the fix.
Could anyone help me out?</description>

              <p>The combat system on allstar is very very basic, you will need to rewrite the entire system to get things to work out better. Most older winterlove based servers weren’t build to emulate rs as you would think, they were build to just be fun to play around on. As a suggestion, you should download one of the newer servers that was focused on combat.</p>
