    <title>Staff Crowns</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/staff-crowns/431074</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking for Staff Crowns that are ready to be used. Don&#39;t hate saying that i should do it myself, trust me, ive tried alot of things. I would appreciate normal RS crowns (gold &amp; silver), but if you have decent custom crowns then they will do aswell.

By the way, yes ive seen alot of topics showing so many staff crowns, but whenever i try to use it the background is either white or black.</description>
