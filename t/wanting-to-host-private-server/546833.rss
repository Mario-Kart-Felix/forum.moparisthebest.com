              <p>Right about now i would settle for any revision running offline, i have ran servers before (562, 525, &amp; 317) about 2 years ago. Ill keep looking for a bundled client. I have ran of localhost but the port wasnt something i had thought about. Ill double check with the codes and let you know about any good news</p>

<p>I would simply recommend downloading a source and client package, and changing the IP that the client connects to in the actual client files. Clients that have a built in IP changer sometimes aren’t the same revision as the source you’re using, or they can be a bit buggy. Download a client and source package and try changing the IP in the client files and let us know how that works out.</p>

              <p>Make sure both (if applicable, not all server’s require the IP) the client and server are on 127.0.0.1 (localhost). Also make sure the server is 100% online before running the client.</p>
