    <description>Sorry-it&#39;s a bit long
Okay so about a year ago I got into making an rsps with my brother. Me and him set it up on an old desktop we used to have and it worked fine for a while. We got it online and everything and were still in the middle of coding it when we had to get rid of the desktop. Before getting rid of it I transfered all the files from the desktop onto my laptop to continue with the server but when I tried to open the server on the laptop it wouldn&#39;t connect and left me at the login screen. Everything was just as it was on the desktop and I only made the necessary changes i.e. updating the jdk version in the .bat files. Well recently I&#39;ve wanted to get back into coding my server and couldnt get it to work for the life of me so I completely erased a whole few months of work and downloaded several different clients/sources, with no prevail. I know I have port forwarded 100% correctly and I have my client.java text set to local (127.0.0.1) and I still cant log in. I&#39;m using the InsidiaX v2 client and source. It&#39;s about the 15th I&#39;ve tried tonight. Can anybody help me? Tv me and check my files to make sure I didnt do something wrong? Any help at all is appreciated. Thanks.&#39;

EDIT:
Also, I checked my server status on RuneLocus and MoparScape and
both times it said my server was &quot;Online.&quot; 
When I go to canyoueeme.org it says my port is open and it can be seen.</description>
