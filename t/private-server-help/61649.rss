    <description>I need help with my private server. I have bitterscape source, and i like it. these are the things i need: i have a no-ip and i need to know how to make it so my friends can just put the IP in moparscape and log on, i dont know how to do that. i also need to know how to make myself owner because my client.java has some missing things i think..i dont know though..also, port forwarding help if that goes under the no-ip section. if u help me, i&#39;ll make u admin/mod (lol) depending on how good u help me   :)
