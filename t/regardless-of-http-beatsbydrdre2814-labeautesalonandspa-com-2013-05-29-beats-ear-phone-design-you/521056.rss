Weekly commentary by Cbs television studios News Chief Wa Correspondent Bob Schieffer.

If individuals who give a half zillion dollars to a governmental campaign reflect your grassroots, that&#39;s some quite tall grass around. By that measure, George soros, the billionaire funding millions of dollars of invasion ads against Leader Bush, is just one more lunch pail Joe handing out campaign brochures down at the unification hall.No, this is not about the grassroots. It is just the latest example of how the big bucks boys on both attributes can find ways throughout the campaign laws as well as do it with the delights of Congress. Advertising campaign laws that allow these kinds of contributions are this kind of mess we should put them all out and start over. But that won&#39;t happen and here is why.
