    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-the-server-634/454514</link>
    <description>hello guys;
to need a little help here on my server, to be more certain is that the client I see it in the edit launch.java 0.0.0.0 and put my HAMACHI IP, woe to compile there is this photo here &quot;http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/96/158p.png/ &quot;I believe that is all right, step over there for my friends play, and not giving it to connect on my server.
I wish someone could help me solve my problem. 
if I can add my MSN: gabriel95b@hotmail.com
or if I need to pass the ID and password to access TeamViewer remote and see WHAT will need grooming.
grateful now await responses.</description>
