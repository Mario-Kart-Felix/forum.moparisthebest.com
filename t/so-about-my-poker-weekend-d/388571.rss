    <title>So about my Poker Weekend :D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-about-my-poker-weekend-d/388571</link>
    <description>Yea so my mate qualified for the &quot;Redtooth National pub league Final&quot; Which is held at Dusk til Dawn in Nottingham.

Dusk til Dawn for those who dont know is the Biggest Poker Club in the UK and is Host of Televised Events such as the UKIPT and others.


So we head down on friday, We go straight til Dusk til Dawn to try and make it for the 7:30 £15+£5 Freezeout Tournament.. We get there at about 8:20PM with 7 minutes left to buy in.

Anyway everyone who started at 7:30 gets 5000 chips.. When i started i got about 4300 chips which is alot less to say the blinds are now at 100/200 and there were 152 people enrolled.

After a rough start i got down to about 2.2k :/ Then i got in my poker state and started playing some good poker.

Pictures of my Progress:

Grey/Black are worth 100
Red is 500
Green = 1000

I was doing well at this point Intimidating every player on my table with building a chip stack I was playing really well i thought at this point.. Knocked a few mid stacks out and my stack kept growing.

Next picture was taken After they chipped me up and 5000 chips (purple) are now in play.. I had taken out a few decent stacks at this point.

Next photo... Lost abit during a hand But still doing well.. I think there were either 2 or 3 tables left.

[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c163/i_kill_muhah/IMG_0398.png[/img]

Now this is where it gets interesting.. Final table. 3 people left By this time i was chip leader. With about 450k out of the 760 chips in play... Just took out the next chip leader and i got heads up with 680k out of the 760k in play.

[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c163/i_kill_muhah/IMG_0399.jpg[/img]

Now.. The last hand blinds at 10,000 and 20,000 with my chip stack i can pretty much call any hand all in.. Other guy goes all in im big blind so 60k more to call, I call with J/2 off suit and he has 9/10 off suit.. Flop comes all low cards, Next was an Ace, Then the river was another Ace. I had Won!!

[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c163/i_kill_muhah/IMG_0400.jpg[/img]

My winnings? £775 (about $1250) Not bad for a £20 entry fee! Had to pay a taxi back to the hotel :/

What we did saturday? Chilled out in the 4star hotel For £108 each for 3 nights it was worth it.. 

For anyone who knows the place its called &quot;Eastwood Hall&quot; Had a superb Indoor swimming pool with Sauna, Jacuzzi, Steam room. Also had A Gym, and a Sports bar with a snooker table. Along with 23 acres of land... Here are some photos of it.

Rooms arnt as good as the 4 star hotel i work at so your paying for the features of the hotel.

Sunday:

Okay, My mates Big Day, Guest appearances from Lucy Pinder (PHROAW) And Dave &quot;Devilfish&quot; Ulliot.

I decided to have my picture taken with both :P

Okay My mate does reasonably okay, 403 players are playing.. He comes 12th for £150

Just before he gets knocked out of the tournament I decide to play another £15+£5 Freezeout This time i played From the start and with 132 players.

Start off not really in the poker mind.. I have KQ off suit with a AJ8 on the board, I raise the flop and one player re-raises me. Wasnt really thinking straight and i shove all in. He instantly calls and turns over JJ giving him trip J&#39;s im thinking at this point.. Shit what have i just done. What does the turn come? a 10 giving me a straight i was like.. Shit damn.

At this point i get moved tables.. Theres a scottish guy that keeps raising..minimum i fold to him a few times and then i&#39;m big blind, I have K8 off suit.. He raises minimum again i feel i have to call Flop comes AK7 he checks i check, turn comes a 9 he raises and i re-raise and he calls. the river comes a 4.. I raise again and he goes all in, I look at him and i think &quot;He hasnt got an ace he&#39;s played it so bad if he has and he doesnt look like the type of player that would&quot; I had a read on him all the way down the board and i knew he didnt have an ace.. So i call instantly.. He turns over a 9 and i take all his chips.

At this point in chip leader on my table with:

[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c163/i_kill_muhah/IMG_0426.png[/img]

People with short stacks are now going all in when i have like A7, At this point if i lost to them it wouldnt really damage my stack, I dont want other people to call so i Re-raise all in too. Most people even if they have AQ would fold to a all in, and another all in. 

Everyone folds and we turn out cards.. he has low cards i hit 7 on the flop and A on the turn.

After a few pots of winning i got up to this:

[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c163/i_kill_muhah/IMG_0427.png[/img]

Thats when it went down hill.. They moved a stack that was pretty much equal to mine.. I hit two pair with K9 and this guy called me all the way down to hit a straight on the river.. 

Two tables left and im down to about 32k with the blinds now at 4000/8000 Not good, I shove with 9/7 suited and get called by A10 of the same suit.. Luckilly i hit a straight on the turn and also trips on the river :D

Got to the final table and we cashed.. Got knocked out two hands in those when i went all in with K7 off suit and get called by AK suited..

So i came 9th, Two days Two final tables Two cashes, I won £39 on this night so All is well, I was slightly disappointed but i know i shouldnt be as its very hard to final table two tournaments with over 100 people in it.</description>

<p>There is only luck in poker in the short-term, once you play a decent sample size luck becomes insignificant.</p>
<p>Your records at DTD/other casinos is purely based on your small sample size, your ROI is probably something ridiculously high like 3000% when over sample the best players can only achieve ~100% ROI in these games, you most likely couldn’t beat the rake.</p>
<p>You are completely wrong, alot of players at DTD are professionals and do play for a living.[/quote]</p>
<p>Um for a start like i said, Most tournaments dont start with a 30k stack, Remember im only playing small stakes IE Max ive ever played is a £25 tournament. just because you start with 5-10k does not mean its a push/fold stack at the start of the tournament… you saying that makes me think your just some guy who thinks he knows alot.</p>
<p>And yea your right… alot of the players there do do that for a living, so explain your point? I really dont get what your saying, Your saying i played some hands terribly which is true, Yea im not a professional player so what? I play some hands brilliantly. I go down to DTD and cash/Final table both the tournaments i play… Sorry but thats slightly more then luck Fella.</p>
<p>Either way. I was sharing my weekend with everyone… If you have anything bad to say then keep it to yourself because quite frankly… I dont care… I never said i was a professional player so to me… your trying to troll.</p>

<p>How can you start playing good poker with 10bb stack? It’s just shove/fold, not exactly hard to remember basic shoving ranges…</p>
<p>Secondly I read some of your hand histories which ofc you play abs terrible and you just get lucky. I mean seriously bet/3b’ing gutshot vs an obvious passive fish? Are you real? Raising MPNK on turn really? So congrats on making a -EV investment, -EV plays and coming out on top. I’d be more proud of a 1% ROI over sample size than just luckboxing my way to a final table.</p>
<p>I forgot how pro live plrs were 8-). Wd on running hot.[/quote]</p>
<p>Your mistaking the tournaments i play for large televised events where you start with 15-30k chips <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also, Im going to ignore everything you just said about getting lucky. Yea theres an element of luck in poker, Like i said with the gutshot i knew i shouldnt have did it.</p>
<p>My cash records from dusk til dawn / Birmingham / Leeds / Manchester kinda beg to differ <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’m not playing against professional players, Nor am I a professional.</p>

              <p>Yea so my mate qualified for the “Redtooth National pub league Final” Which is held at Dusk til Dawn in Nottingham.</p>
<p>Dusk til Dawn for those who dont know is the Biggest Poker Club in the UK and is Host of Televised Events such as the UKIPT and others.</p>
<p>So we head down on friday, We go straight til Dusk til Dawn to try and make it for the 7:30 £15+£5 Freezeout Tournament… We get there at about 8:20PM with 7 minutes left to buy in.</p>
<p>Anyway everyone who started at 7:30 gets 5000 chips… When i started i got about 4300 chips which is alot less to say the blinds are now at 100/200 and there were 152 people enrolled.</p>
<p>After a rough start i got down to about 2.2k <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> Then i got in my poker state and started playing some good poker.</p>

<p>Grey/Black are worth 100<br>
Red is 500<br>
Green = 1000</p>
<p>I was doing well at this point Intimidating every player on my table with building a chip stack I was playing really well i thought at this point… Knocked a few mid stacks out and my stack kept growing.</p>
<p>Next picture was taken After they chipped me up and 5000 chips (purple) are now in play… I had taken out a few decent stacks at this point.</p>

<p>Now this is where it gets interesting… Final table. 3 people left By this time i was chip leader. With about 450k out of the 760 chips in play… Just took out the next chip leader and i got heads up with 680k out of the 760k in play.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c163/i_kill_muhah/IMG_0399.jpg" title="IMG_0399.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c163/i_kill_muhah/IMG_0399.jpg" alt width="669" height="500"><div class="meta">

<p>Now… The last hand blinds at 10,000 and 20,000 with my chip stack i can pretty much call any hand all in… Other guy goes all in im big blind so 60k more to call, I call with J/2 off suit and he has 9/10 off suit… Flop comes all low cards, Next was an Ace, Then the river was another Ace. I had Won!!</p>

<p>What we did saturday? Chilled out in the 4star hotel For £108 each for 3 nights it was worth it…</p>
<p>For anyone who knows the place its called “Eastwood Hall” Had a superb Indoor swimming pool with Sauna, Jacuzzi, Steam room. Also had A Gym, and a Sports bar with a snooker table. Along with 23 acres of land… Here are some photos of it.</p>

<p>Okay My mate does reasonably okay, 403 players are playing… He comes 12th for £150</p>
<p>Just before he gets knocked out of the tournament I decide to play another £15+£5 Freezeout This time i played From the start and with 132 players.</p>
<p>Start off not really in the poker mind… I have KQ off suit with a AJ8 on the board, I raise the flop and one player re-raises me. Wasnt really thinking straight and i shove all in. He instantly calls and turns over JJ giving him trip J’s im thinking at this point… Shit what have i just done. What does the turn come? a 10 giving me a straight i was like… Shit damn.</p>
<p>At this point i get moved tables… Theres a scottish guy that keeps raising…minimum i fold to him a few times and then i’m big blind, I have K8 off suit… He raises minimum again i feel i have to call Flop comes AK7 he checks i check, turn comes a 9 he raises and i re-raise and he calls. the river comes a 4… I raise again and he goes all in, I look at him and i think “He hasnt got an ace he’s played it so bad if he has and he doesnt look like the type of player that would” I had a read on him all the way down the board and i knew he didnt have an ace… So i call instantly… He turns over a 9 and i take all his chips.</p>
<p>At this point in chip leader on my table with:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c163/i_kill_muhah/IMG_0426.png" title="IMG_0426.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c163/i_kill_muhah/IMG_0426.png" alt width="670" height="500"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">IMG_0426.png</span><span class="informations">720×537</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>People with short stacks are now going all in when i have like A7, At this point if i lost to them it wouldnt really damage my stack, I dont want other people to call so i Re-raise all in too. Most people even if they have AQ would fold to a all in, and another all in.</p>
<p>Everyone folds and we turn out cards… he has low cards i hit 7 on the flop and A on the turn.</p>
<p>After a few pots of winning i got up to this:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c163/i_kill_muhah/IMG_0427.png" title="IMG_0427.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c163/i_kill_muhah/IMG_0427.png" alt width="372" height="500"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">IMG_0427.png</span><span class="informations">537×720</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Thats when it went down hill… They moved a stack that was pretty much equal to mine… I hit two pair with K9 and this guy called me all the way down to hit a straight on the river…</p>
<p>Two tables left and im down to about 32k with the blinds now at 4000/8000 Not good, I shove with 9/7 suited and get called by A10 of the same suit… Luckilly i hit a straight on the turn and also trips on the river <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Got to the final table and we cashed… Got knocked out two hands in those when i went all in with K7 off suit and get called by AK suited…</p>
<p>So i came 9th, Two days Two final tables Two cashes, I won £39 on this night so All is well, I was slightly disappointed but i know i shouldnt be as its very hard to final table two tournaments with over 100 people in it.</p>
