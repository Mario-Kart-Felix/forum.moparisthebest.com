    <description>I need 2 things help with client that i CANT find a tutorial for...

I need a way to .jar my client when i do it i always get errors a tutorial on jaring would be nice and i havent checked runeserver cuz their search always takes me to topics that have nothing to do with what i asked. ...

Second thing is an updater. I want to stop makin ppl redownload shit... i never figured out how to make an automatic client updater so that when i update my client i can make it so all the clients automaticly download the required stuff that would be very helpfull indeed !

Love you guys idk if its aganst rules to say you will get alot of rep if u help cuz i know a few ppl with the same question and ill definately link them to this topic if its solved so that whoever gave the solution gets th credit they deserve even if it isnt their tutorials or whatever :) they still helped</description>
