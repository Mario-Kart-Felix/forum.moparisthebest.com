I compiled, no errors.<br>
I found all the IP’s since their were 3 worlds to select from, changed them all to 127.0.0.1 and then their was 3 different ports also and changed them all to 43594 also.</p>
<p>Bump, someone please help me. :<br>

<li>I’m trying to help so chill yo’ beans.<br>
Make sure the server is also set to 43594. The server doesn’t need an IP because it’s set to a global IP, meaning it doesn’t matter what IP you use, the server is casted on it.<br>
Anyways, the last time I had this issue, it was because there was a problem with my client.java/server.java and nothing came up wrong, but it wouldn’t let anything connect.[/quote]</li>

<li>My bad.</li>
<li>You took forever. &amp; i doubled check and i remember i forgot to search "Server = " for different unsearchable ip’s.<br>
Forgot that there is ip’s there that need to be changed also, now it works.<br>
Thanks for reminding me! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">

Try to compile the server and check for errors.<br>
Make sure the client is set to 127.0.0.1 some have more then 1 IP</p>
