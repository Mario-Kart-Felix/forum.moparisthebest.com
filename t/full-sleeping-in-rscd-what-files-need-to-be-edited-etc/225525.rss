    <title>Full sleeping in RSCD - what files need to be edited etc?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/full-sleeping-in-rscd-what-files-need-to-be-edited-etc/225525</link>
    <description>Well I see RSCA has somehow succeeded to get the sleeping screen, where you have to enter a word(in real RSC) or have to do some math(in RSCA).
I got couple of questions now, concerning that:
1) Where and how is the sleeping screen stored and what file has the sleeping function, screen etc stored?
2) What files total should be edited(just a clue, it saves me alot time)?

Thanks in advance,
Hoping to get answers from someone who take things seriously and/or has knowledge/information about all that. &quot;Lamers&quot; and other kids should stay away, no need for you to show out your lameness. : p

Waiting for responses. :)
P.S! xEnt, if you read this thread, then I believe these questions are related to RSC server development. Or should I send you separately PM?</description>

              <p>Yes, I just looked into this a little bit. It does use images, but I don’t think the server actually sends the images to the client (as I thought you said KO9). However, the images are probably stored in one of the cache-files, which are loaded when the client starts (I assume). The server must also have some kind of reference to or copy of these images in any type of format (either if it is just plain text, or anything else), that are also indexed in the same way as the ones in the client.</p>
<p>It seems as if the server only sends some type of index to the client, where the client picks the image with that particular index, and handles it on the server-side using that index aswell.</p>
<p>Also, for the server to generate an image, and send this to the client, would require alot more data to be sent than just using already pre-defined images stored in the clients cache-files (that just uses an index that have to be randomized and sent to the client). To actually modify the sleeping-process would be alot easier this way, but I honestly doubt they thought anyone would ever be able to modify their cache-files when they made it. I don’t really think they care anymore anyway.</p>

              <p>Yeh because if you had access to a raw string of the equation/sleepword in clientside, it would be so easy for bots to bypass. From the looks of it, it looks like a basic looking class that creates the image from a string, i wonder if there’s a class to turn the byte-array or image to string.</p>

              <p>[quote=“ephemeral, post:8, topic:225525”]It can all be summarized somewhat as the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When you click on an item on the client-side, a packet for this command will be sent to the server. If this item is represented by an InventoryItem that is used for sleeping (sleeping-bag then I assume) on the server-side, the sleeping-proceedure will take place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have activated the sleeping-proceedure, and your Player-class on the server-side could hold a reference to a class called for instance ‘Sleeping’. This class generates a random word, or String of text (either if it is something you can calculate, or just simply compare with another String of text). The generated text will be stored in a String-format in the Sleeping-class for your Player-class. Note: If it is for calculation, you might want to store the result as the word in your Sleeping-class instead, for easier management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The String of text held in your Sleeping-class will be translated into a byte-array, and sent to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you write a word in the client, and clicks Enter (or whatever it uses), your client sends back another byte-array, that later is translated back, and compared to the word in your Sleeping-class. If both the words are correct, your ‘sleeping-session’ will be done with… If not, then just re-do the whole proceedure (also re-do it if the client requests a new word).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This was just my understanding on how it works by reading some of the above text, aswell as analyzing the matter in my head (logical thinking). But as I havn’t really looked into it yet (the reading and writing of bytes to it), I might be wrong… This was also to give you ideas on how to solve it (the ones of you who already havn’t, that is).</p>
<p>Also, what is written in the box client-side, is just a simple String of text… The client doesn’t know anything, except for how it should show it to you. The client only does what it is told by either you, or the server. The server, however, does not need you to tell what it should do.[/quote]</p>
<p>This is pretty much correct, however it is an image which the server generates and sends to the client (on the fly). The client doesn’t handle it as a string, it is displayed as an image. This is to prevent packet interception.</p>

<p>Hi cr0ss, the sleep screen is just an image in the client, I’m not sure how the flashy Z’s are made but it’s purely on the client side - I believe Zerratar just grabbed an original RSC client and decompiled it. The server sends the math equation as an image, the client never knows what it it just displays the image in the box.[/quote]</p>
<p>i know the zzz’s can be changed in client to what ever you want it to be<br>
the math was a good idea cuz if you would have just kept it as the old words, the ocr’s would be back in play again<br>
not saying that it isnt hard to update the ocr’s for numbers but either way not worth it anymore</p>

<p>Server sends an image of bytes for the size of only that middle bit i guess.</p>

              <p>This is RSC development since your not actually asking for the code.</p>
<p>The client draw’s an Image to the screen which was created by the server, and sent to the client in a byte array, the client recieves the bytes and paints it to an image. Shouldn’t be too hard to do if you look into the java Image class.</p>
<p>The way RSCA have it (i think) is that they have a bunch of strings e.g “5 + 5 = ?” and have an answer for each string. Since they don’t store images externally on their server, i believe it’s just a class that creates an image by giving it a string, width/height etc. it then get’s its bytes and sends it to client.</p>
<p>I think the person who made it for RSCA was Zerrentar if that’s how you spell it.</p>
<p>That’s as far as i can take you.</p>

              <p>Well I see RSCA has somehow succeeded to get the sleeping screen, where you have to enter a word(in real RSC) or have to do some math(in RSCA).<br>
I got couple of questions now, concerning that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where and how is the sleeping screen stored and what file has the sleeping function, screen etc stored?</li>
<li>What files total should be edited(just a clue, it saves me alot time)?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br>
Hoping to get answers from someone who take things seriously and/or has knowledge/information about all that. “Lamers” and other kids should stay away, no need for you to show out your lameness. : p</p>
<p>Waiting for responses. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
P.S! xEnt, if you read this thread, then I believe these questions are related to RSC server development. Or should I send you separately PM?</p>
