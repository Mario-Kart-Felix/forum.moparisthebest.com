    <title>Runescape Server Files</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-server-files/537380</link>
    <description>Hello, i&#39;ve just downloaded a server to start editing it. I would like to know how to start doing it, i know about Object oriented programming and java basics + some advance things.

The thing i&#39;d like to know is which are the key files for editing it (Example, in which file would i add a NPC, since Class5 file doesn&#39;t exist in this verison i couldn&#39;t find the file :c)

This would be for a base server file called: Rune-Evolution it&#39;s a 718/734 server.

Thanks in advance!</description>

              <p>Well to be honest when I began RSPS coding back in August 2013, all i knew how to do was change variables… Which isnt even coding. Then I began taking classes for java on Udemy. After a month and a half or so, i began to look into the many different files located in the server since i was able to understand it now. I then tried to figure out what were the main classes and what each of them did (all servers are not written the same way, you have to relearn the new system anytime you switch bases, hyperion, runesource, etc are examples.</p>
<p>So once i understood it, i began to simply add basic functions to the thing such as point systems, making it save to the player files, and also adding my own content like quests which are actually easy to make</p>

I’ve learned that it is way easier to learn to code higher revisions if you start editing a lower one. I started a 317, now working on a 637. Good luck.<br>

I’ve learned that it’s easier to program any RSPS if you go learn Java. That really sounds like something OP should do[/quote]<br>
+1 I agree</p>

<p>Seeing as class5 is the name of a class in a client that may be your first problem. Now are you trying to spawn an npc with in the server or are you trying to add an npc to the client?</p>
