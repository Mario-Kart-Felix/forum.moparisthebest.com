    <title>All servers are showing as down</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/all-servers-are-showing-as-down/110060</link>
    <description>Please help, when we put in a server ip, and attempt to log in, it says
&quot;Error Connecting to server. Must be down. Click cancel and then start server to create your own&quot;
We do that and it says
&quot;The server has successfully started.  now just log in with any username and any password. have fun.&quot;
we get the option to click &quot;ok&quot;
we do so and it comes up with the screen start server and enter. clicking enter comes up with our default ip which is 127.0.0.1
we put in username and password it says &quot;Error Connecting to server. Must be down. Click cancel and then start server to create your own&quot; again.
we have tried like 30 different server ips and they all say the same. 

Please help me =[


(at the bottom of the screen it also says this if its helpful)
