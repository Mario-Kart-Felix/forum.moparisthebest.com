    <title>RSCD V25 help (few errors)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rscd-v25-help-few-errors/387137</link>
    <description>Hi, I was using divinepk but found it too buggy for my tastes, and heard that RSCD v25 was the way to go. I am having a few issues setting up RSCD V25.. So here is the first thing that went wrong. 

Heres how I did it since I ventured off of the original TUT (http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,309101.0.html)

First I downloaded the Rscd v25 Source,  Rscd v25 Www Files, and Rscd .sql Database. Next (instead of xamplite because I never could get it working) I got WAMP (http://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/files/WampServer%202/WampServer%202.1/WampServer2.1e-x32.exe/download)

Then I loaded PHP my admin, created the database rscd, then imported the .sql file. Afterwards I took the wamp WWW folder, deleted it, and pasted in the one I downloaded. I am pretty sure I set up my paths correctly, if needed I can update this post with pictures of those too. So I compiled it (to see if it would) said it was successful... so I loaded run_lserver, then ran run_server. Here is the first thing thats wrong.. 

1) Attempting to connect to LS....
[URL=http://img14.imageshack.us/i/attemptingtoconnectols.png/][IMG]http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/1554/attemptingtoconnectols.png[/img][/URL]
(it basically kept doing this till I closed it, also a post off another topic told me to go to ant\bin and edit the ant.bat and put a pause in there.. along with putting localhost instead of my IP in LS.. which made the loginserver/engine work apparently)

Also, ever since I added the www files and loaded up local host I got this at the top of my screen.

[URL=http://img855.imageshack.us/i/errord.png/][IMG]http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1858/errord.png[/img][/URL]

Then I tried to register a character.. when I clicked confirm / make the account it brought up this screen.

[URL=http://img695.imageshack.us/i/404notfoundn.png/][IMG]http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/79/404notfoundn.png[/img][/URL]

So then I refresh the page, and it says I am logged in. So I try and log out and I get the blue screen again.

Now the final error came after all this, in phpmyadmin.

[URL=http://img820.imageshack.us/i/phpmyadminerror.png/][IMG]http://img820.imageshack.us/img820/1500/phpmyadminerror.png[/img][/URL]

What did I do wrong?  :confused:


Thanks in advance for any help, and if you need more information to help figure out this issue please let me know.

--Steven

::EDIT:: 

Can I just use the WWW file from divinepk? That worked good (just didnt have a forum). Didn&#39;t know if they can mix and match :D</description>
