    <title>Best method for training HP?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-method-for-training-hp/385666</link>
    <description>So in ye olde days I&#39;d go Ape Atoll or somewhere and barrage the fuck out of multi combat enemies. Problem is; 1 Prayer. Can&#39;t do DT for Ancients (reqs 11 iirc).

So I heard of these red chinchompas but I can&#39;t go to Ape Atoll because most people train there and get fat XP but pray...  So I need ideas.


I&#39;m think chins at Soul Wars, with every 100 zeal going to HP?? Although I&#39;ve heard its horrendously laggy (and will chinning go well on players with armour?) hopefully this should be able to get the most out of my chins. Maybe there&#39;s another multi combat area I&#39;m unaware of though, or maybe it&#39;s even possible to chin at ape atoll without prayer? 

An awful lot has changed in the 3-4 years I&#39;ve not played so just throw all suggestions at me. I&#39;m going for speed, so high HP XP an hour is essential. Preferably trained through either range or magic.

Cost is no problem. This goes for armour, pots, food or whatever. Oh, I have 80+hp, 90+def, 90+ att, 80str if this info helps :)</description>

              <p>I agree Lothy, which is why I stake while training so I’m staking while I’ve not got 99s, then once I do (which realistically is going to take some time) then I will only really be fighting over maxed people anyway. I could even stop at 97 or something. I used to do a lot of staking before they removed all the free trade, so now its back I’m back on it and just sort of finding out what’s changed.</p>
<p>For instance, boxing is fine, but for the sake of faster duels I’m going to need 80 Dungeoneering for a Rapier <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I have considered the magic route, I actually did the quest for chaos gauntlets so I could just fire bolt steel drags or something but if I can red chin for faster XP, I will <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<blockquote>Mummies in the chaos tunnels? To be honest, you're going to get fucked up though aren't you?</blockquote>
I don't know, sounds like a new place since I played so I'll look into it. With 90 def (plus I can super def pot - they're cheap as fuck) maybe I'll survive. I'm pretty sure I'd get fucked up at Ape Atoll though.
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>What if I went to Ape Atoll or these chaos tunnels, got a friend with a high level main to stand in front of me with an ivevnt full of prayer pots, he can alch or something while I just sit and chin the fuck out of them all? (I have a mate who would probs be willing if this seems feasible)</p>

<p>Also, you should know that 99s aren’t always the best for a staking account. People see a 99 and shit bricks, even if they’re like 90 in the stat themselves. It’s just some psychological thing, probably induced by the tremendous amount of experience required to get those last 9 levels.</p>
<p>Probably much slower, but have you considered getting and using firewave on a monster like black demons?</p>

              <p>I make money staking as I go along. 2 weeks ago I had bugger all stats and 4m. Now the account is training in gear worth like 80m. This is mainly due to me looking up current RS2 staking, discovering that a large percentage of the “staking guides” on various forums and youtube all teach people the gambler’s fallacy and as a consequence massively profiteering off these idiots.</p>
<p>I know about Ape Atoll, I want to know if anyone knows if you can train there with 1 prayer, or what other spots exist for multi-combat.</p>
<p>Why would chinning players be bad? do they not hit through armour? because at soul wars there is definitely enough people crowded around the graveyards to probably hit a 3x3 grid of players (although I’ve only been there once and didn’t really understand what the hell was going on, I’ve since read up on the minigame :)) Also your link mentions chinning at pest control, but I believe that’s monsters not players, so I could definitely try that out.</p>

              <p>Well since red chinchompas attack all near by creatures in a 3x3 grid training on players is <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> the way to go. You need to find a multi combat area where the baddies stack on you. The best spot that I know of however is on ape atoll.</p>
<p>After a quick google though <a href="http://runescape.salmoneus.net/ranging_help.html#chinchompa">http://runescape.salmoneus.net/ranging_help.html#chinchompa</a> provides you with a few other methods to train using chins. It also appears that castle wars can be a decent way to train but I still wouldn’t suggest using them on players.</p>
<p>Also, why isn’t money a problem? :o</p>

<p>Modern RS Players are so dumb, they can’t do probability at all and think if they lose and then stake double the next duel they’re more likely to win.</p>
