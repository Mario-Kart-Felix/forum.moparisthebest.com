    <title>Ugh..Server Troubles..Agian</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ugh-server-troubles-agian/80879</link>
    <description>         Alright, So im having a bit of trouble with my server, Seems like this is a common thing.
So Im going to ask for a little help. Ive tried almost everything suggested by the people that 
are on the forums. Mod T&#39;s Guide was ok But I never got the sources correct. I have Hamaichi, like someone
told me to get. And I also have Mod T&#39;s Server Program..But it keeps saying that I dont have Java componets..So I went to get JDK 6.0 and after it FINALLY was done downloading...It said I dont have the correct
updates to Java.  And i think that part of the problem is that it cant find Java becasue I changed the Varibles on It when I went to &gt;Start&gt;Control Panal&gt;System&gt;Enviromental..And So now its In The Bin?? Ughh Idk. Im just trying to get my server up. Any Suggestions would be gladly glady Appreciated.
