    <title>[PI] 3 problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-3-problems/363882</link>
    <description>My base is Project Insanity. I have a couple of questions to ask:

[b]PROBLEM 1:[/b] How to make it like Skillcapes only appear in shop if you get 99 in that skill?

[b]PROBLEM 2:[/b] NPCs are not dropping anything, how to make like they start dropping items. I have done all work in NPCDrops.TSM. Its done right. I think its important for you to know that the source is MTP V2 -by marcbob. Hope you know how to?

[b]PROBLEM 3:[/b] How can I make a voting system which requires no MySQL. I want it like some one votes for server and when they do ::claim, they get cash only if they have voted in a particular site or any way for that.

Please answer in the format... problem 1:..
                                         problem 2:..

Hope someone helps me.</description>
