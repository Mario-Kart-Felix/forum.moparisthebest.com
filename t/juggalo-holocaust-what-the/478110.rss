    <title>Juggalo Holocaust? What the</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/juggalo-holocaust-what-the/478110</link>
    <description>My friend was telling me today about this alleged Juggalo Holocaust today, and apparently, it&#39;s a bit more serious than I came to thought.
From what I read [url=http://chicagoist.com/2010/04/28/juggalupdate.php]here[/url] There&#39;s a whole website dedicated to this &#39;cause&#39;. People are nuts man. To be a juggalo is one thing, to be a juggalo that is part of the gang side is another. Killing them because of it is immoral, cause after all, it&#39;s a choice. And, well. Killing is wrong.
Apparently, this is the head site of all the madness here:
http://www.juggaloholocaust.com/

What do?</description>

There is 2 different parts of this “gang” there’s the idiots that treat it as a gang, and the ones that follow ICP for the music.</p>
