    <title>[PI]Npc&#39;s can only be attacked by one person in a multi area</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-npcs-can-only-be-attacked-by-one-person-in-a-multi-area/356829</link>
    <description>I&#39;m adding GWD to my PI base. Made it a multi area, and made it so you can attack an npc while under attack by another one. Whenever another person attacks a boss while someone else is fighting it, it says, this npc is already in combat. Would I resolve this in Npchandler or CombatAssistant? Any help please.</description>
