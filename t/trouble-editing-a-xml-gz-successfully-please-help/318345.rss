    <description>Hey there guys. I&#39;m a noob editor, as I&#39;m obviously not a coder and will never claim to be! At least for now.

I&#39;m trying to edit the name of the &quot;Iron Square Shield&quot; that&#39;s sold in the Falador shield shop. 

I figured this was done by editing the name in &#39;ItemDefs.xml.gz&#39;. 
- - -
So I opened up the file with 7zip, changed the name, and saved it. I then used a compression tool to turn it back into a &#39;.xml.gz.&#39; file. And replaced the old &#39;ItemDefs.xml.gz&#39; with this new edited one. 

Did I do something wrong? Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks guys.
