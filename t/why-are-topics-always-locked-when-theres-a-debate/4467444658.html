<p>Until he is banned forum-sided, he has a right to stay and say what the fuck he wants to say. Just because its a waste of time doesn’t mean he is going to leave, maybe the man has a lot of time to waste? Im not saying what tarkoff did was right, but Im not going to turn my back on him because he decided to fuck shit (noticed i said shit) up. Just like how I didn’t expect everyone to turn on matty when he burnt down my town (staff or not). If you weren’t directly involved in the situation, then you have no reason to judge what the fuck tarkoff did.[/quote]<br>
If the ‘man’ has lots of time to waste, why would he spend it arguing on a forum and debating over a server that is going to ‘fail’ (as he said), that’s pretty fucking sad honestly.  Obviously he’s here to try and get everyone as enraged as possible and try to get everyone to hate Tom.  Matty is actually an intelligent person, unlike Tarkoff.  Instead of raging on the forums and continue to cause a ruckus, he just disappeared for a while and came back absolutely calm.  Everyone one the server was involved with the situation, you have no room to talk since you don’t even play.  Just because you and Tarkoff X-rayed diamonds together doesn’t mean he was a good person, and same for you.  I always kept my distance from Tarkoff because I knew he X-rayed, and if I went against his word I’d probably be banned.  I’m glad he’s gone, and so is everyone else.  So I do have a reason to judge what the fuck Tarkoff did.</p>

<p>lol. The only diamonds i had were the ones looted from the town next to mine that coonhunter died with while traveling. Which I then burnt half of them right in front of tom because he was butthurt about “the economy” of a server that doesn’t even have an economy. No, you and the new fags that just joined the server are glad he is gone. He was always a respectful player, and built more on world2 then you could imagine building. Im not saying he xrayed or not, but on a server with shitty players (like this one) its hard to tell who is and who isn’t xraying. Anywho, If i xrayed I would have went for more iron then I did diamonds. I could always use railing <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Tarkoff isn’t dragging everyone down. there are 2 sides right now, the ones that don’t give a fuck and the ones that knows where tark is comming from. He isn’t going to make anyone leave by what he is saying, and he is intelligent enough to know this. He is just proving his point that the server is ran by tom and, if tom doesn’t like it tom fixes it to the way he wants things.</p>
<p>Also, If im not mistaking you weren’t playing when this whole shit between everyone that already hated tom and everyone that hates him now situation went down. I remember a long period of time where you never even logged on (probably because the server wasn’t updated). Tom has proved that he can get away with almost anything with no consequences.</p>

        <p>He did tell his side of the story (even before he went of the rails it was investigated), he posted a topic in public, and in the staff section. I didn’t remove anyones posts in this topic, so this blatant assumption that it was me (big bad tom) again just shows how some of you are unwilling to listen to reason and assume it’s me behind everything.</p>
<p>There is no “what tom says goes” anywhere on Mopar, a lot of the stuff I do is discussed on the IRC before it is done. I simply am the admin that carries a lot of the enforcement and changes out.</p>
<p>I admit, I have made mistakes in the past, perhaps I was too trigger happy when it comes to PVP but there really is no reason to be so negative in topics like these, I am on the IRC all day, everyday and I will listen respectfully if you have an issue. I’m really not as bad as you all make out, as anyone who has spoken to me will tell you.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Tom, post:26, topic:446744”]He did tell his side of the story (even before he went of the rails it was investigated), he posted a topic in public, and in the staff section. I didn’t remove anyones posts in this topic, so this blatant assumption that it was me (big bad tom) again just shows how some of you are unwilling to listen to reason and assume it’s me behind everything.</p>
<p>There is no “what tom says goes” anywhere on Mopar, a lot of the stuff I do is discussed on the IRC before it is done. I simply am the admin that carries a lot of the enforcement and changes out.</p>
<p>I admit, I have made mistakes in the past, perhaps I was too trigger happy when it comes to PVP but there really is no reason to be so negative in topics like these, I am on the IRC all day, everyday and I will listen respectfully if you have an issue. I’m really not as bad as you all make out, as anyone who has spoken to me will tell you.[/quote]<br>

<p>Just because Im never on now, doesn’t mean I dont play the server. I recently gave my items up simply because Its hard to make time to play a game when you spend all of your time working to survive. maybe you will understand that once you get out from under mommies wing.</p>
<p>And my last post was relating to the forum, not the server. If you read my posts, I specifically said “im not saying what he did was right” so YOU stop being fucking retarded, learn to read a whole post maybe?</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/main.html">@main</a> point of topic; how can you say ‘debates’ are locked, when this topic of spam/back-and-forth ranting over what happened, isn’t being locked. This really isn’t a discussion anymore, it’s just people arguing back and forth, and I believe it is ready to be over.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/main.html">@main</a> point of topic; how can you say ‘debates’ are locked, when this topic of spam/back-and-forth ranting over what happened, isn’t being locked. This really isn’t a discussion anymore, it’s just people arguing back and forth, and I believe it is ready to be over.</p>

</aside>
<p>There isn’t much to say about my OP, just wanted to make my point! I guess this can be locked now as nobody else seems to have anything constructive to offer and this isn’t a topic about tarkoff. Or you know, people could stop spamming? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
