    <title>Why are topics always locked when there&#39;s a debate?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-are-topics-always-locked-when-theres-a-debate/446744</link>
    <description>I can understand locking topics when people are spamming dumb shit and acting a bit childish, and the same goes for deleting posts. But why do staff so often do this for posts that discuss issues that they don&#39;t agree with? I mean seriously, you&#39;re not running a regime here, it&#39;s just a forum.

Does it really matter if someone says something negative about how things are run? As long as the post isn&#39;t personally insulting, then they&#39;re entitled to their opinion and others are entitled to read it. If the post is wrong then make a reply so that others can see why it was wrong. Deleting a post, locking a topic or muting someone just indicates that you know they may raise a legitimate point that you don&#39;t want others agreeing with. Or am I missing something here - do you have very strict bandwidth concerns? Does it improve your link juice if everything is kept to non-meta discussion? Is there so much activity on this forum that we, as readers, simply cannot handle?

Latest example is this topic: http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,549624.0.html
Why was he muted and not allowed to explain himself publicly? Why was his first topic deleted? What does muting someone on the forums achieve when they misbehaved in-game? This pisses me off because the same happened to me when I got banned in-game, and could only watch Davidi construct his lies. By the time my mute expired I didn&#39;t have enough shits left to explain what actually happened.

Cue the smart one-word replies, and if I&#39;m lucky, a cleared out &amp; locked thread with a smart answer from mitb.</description>

<p>There isn’t much to say about my OP, just wanted to make my point! I guess this can be locked now as nobody else seems to have anything constructive to offer and this isn’t a topic about tarkoff. Or you know, people could stop spamming? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

Not sure what you’re all trying to achieve here, Tarkoff isn’t getting staff back and he has apparently quit. This can’t be changed now, the hybrid has took a hit and so has Tarkoff and that is in the past, [b]and nobody can change that. if you guys have personal disagreements then feel free to settle them in private.</p>
<p>I don’t even see how this is relevant to the OP.[/b]<br>

<p>Just because Im never on now, doesn’t mean I dont play the server. I recently gave my items up simply because Its hard to make time to play a game when you spend all of your time working to survive. maybe you will understand that once you get out from under mommies wing.</p>
<p>And my last post was relating to the forum, not the server. If you read my posts, I specifically said “im not saying what he did was right” so YOU stop being fucking retarded, learn to read a whole post maybe?</p>

<p>There is no “what tom says goes” anywhere on Mopar, a lot of the stuff I do is discussed on the IRC before it is done. I simply am the admin that carries a lot of the enforcement and changes out.</p>

<p>There is no “what tom says goes” anywhere on Mopar, a lot of the stuff I do is discussed on the IRC before it is done. I simply am the admin that carries a lot of the enforcement and changes out.</p>
<p>I admit, I have made mistakes in the past, perhaps I was too trigger happy when it comes to PVP but there really is no reason to be so negative in topics like these, I am on the IRC all day, everyday and I will listen respectfully if you have an issue. I’m really not as bad as you all make out, as anyone who has spoken to me will tell you.</p>

</aside>
<p>If the ‘man’ has lots of time to waste, why would he spend it arguing on a forum and debating over a server that is going to ‘fail’ (as he said), that’s pretty fucking sad honestly.  Obviously he’s here to try and get everyone as enraged as possible and try to get everyone to hate Tom.  Matty is actually an intelligent person, unlike Tarkoff.  Instead of raging on the forums and continue to cause a ruckus, he just disappeared for a while and came back absolutely calm.  Everyone one the server was involved with the situation, you have no room to talk since you don’t even play.  Just because you and Tarkoff X-rayed diamonds together doesn’t mean he was a good person, and same for you.  I always kept my distance from Tarkoff because I knew he X-rayed, and if I went against his word I’d probably be banned.  I’m glad he’s gone, and so is everyone else.  So I do have a reason to judge what the fuck Tarkoff did.[/quote]</p>
<p>lol. The only diamonds i had were the ones looted from the town next to mine that coonhunter died with while traveling. Which I then burnt half of them right in front of tom because he was butthurt about “the economy” of a server that doesn’t even have an economy. No, you and the new fags that just joined the server are glad he is gone. He was always a respectful player, and built more on world2 then you could imagine building. Im not saying he xrayed or not, but on a server with shitty players (like this one) its hard to tell who is and who isn’t xraying. Anywho, If i xrayed I would have went for more iron then I did diamonds. I could always use railing <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Tarkoff isn’t dragging everyone down. there are 2 sides right now, the ones that don’t give a fuck and the ones that knows where tark is comming from. He isn’t going to make anyone leave by what he is saying, and he is intelligent enough to know this. He is just proving his point that the server is ran by tom and, if tom doesn’t like it tom fixes it to the way he wants things.</p>
<p>Also, If im not mistaking you weren’t playing when this whole shit between everyone that already hated tom and everyone that hates him now situation went down. I remember a long period of time where you never even logged on (probably because the server wasn’t updated). Tom has proved that he can get away with almost anything with no consequences.</p>

<p>as for agl.<br>
The server has been fucked since before I started playing with its bullshit “tom owns all” dictatorship, Why do you guys even get butthurt anyways? You’ll all drown in toms bullshit eventually, whether your friends with him or not. Simple reason I quit playing, toms retarded censorship rules and shitty server players. lol</p>

              <p>Correct! Just because someone deserves to be banned doesn’t mean they don’t deserve a chance for a public explanation, and people should be able to have a little discussion about it. <span class="bbcode-b">Especially someone who’s been playing the server for a long time and was a <span class="bbcode-i">staff member</span></span>. This attitude of “OH THIS GUY IS A BADDIE NOW LETS TREAT HIM LIKE SHIT IN EVERY WAY” is ridiculous - he’s the same fucking person you all loved and made staff. Anyway, you seem to be missing my point, I was just using this case as an example.</p>
