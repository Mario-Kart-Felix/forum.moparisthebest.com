    <title>How do i make it so, after i die, my hp is set back to whatever my hp level is?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-it-so-after-i-die-my-hp-is-set-back-to-whatever-my-hp-level-is/387232</link>
    <description>When i die, my hp level stays at 0. And i cannot move, or teleport, or eat, or anything.

I want to be able to let people have their hp level back after they die. So if they have 80 hp, after they die, i want them to have 80 hp again. Please help?

Thanks.</description>
