My point is can i get a rollback? Because i have posted around 3-4 seperate topics each including different amounts of proof, even though most went to the solved reports section but NOTHING was rolled back.<br>

        <p>[quote=“Tom_BETA, post:38, topic:408257”]A vote on any moderator commands would never work, you have the groups of friends just abusing it and people kicking people they don’t like. Why would you want to kick someone anyway?</p>
<p>Just seems like a “He’s pvping me, omg! friend,1,2,3,4,5,6 kick vote omg!”.[/quote]Well obviously it wouldn’t be that simple. Players with more reputation (gained by submitting valid reports and confirmed kicks, bans and mutes - not forum reputation) will have more power. So if you had two members with high reputation, they could together ban someone for rule breaking. This would then be checked later on, and if they abused their power then they get punished. I don’t believe people who have taken the time to earn this would abuse it, as they could lose all of their power, the person would be unbanned, and the abusers could be banned themselves. On the other hand, if you had a load of new accounts with no reputation they’d have absolutely no influence on the system. I think maybe people are underestimating the value of reputation you’d need to gain these priviledges.</p>
<p>tbh, after writing about it, it sounds a lot like the current system - only automatic to compensate for the staff inactivity. You yourself worked for long hours reporting topics and helping people in the server section to become a moderator, and anyone else could do the same. The only reason you don’t abuse your power is because it’s taken so much time to earn the position, and you wouldn’t want to lose it. The same goes for earning reputation. Nobody wants to spend time earning shittons of rep just to lose it all by abusing.</p>

<p>Did you even read my post? I know for a fact that when you tried to become a moderator, you simply reported things and followed the rules. I’m sure this is the case with other moderators, and I’m sure you’re going to tell me there’s some magical secret way of getting in. I don’t see anything wrong with this, I’m just saying that the current process of gaining power is not unlike an automated reputation system.</p>

<p>I can’t actually think of any successful real-world nomination based systems from the top of my head. For example, if you wanted to get in to a good school, it’d be more fair for them to give entrance grades than for the governors to sit in a circle and pick kids because they know their parents. If you want to work for a major bank, you apply, and they give you the job based on skills and experience - the board of directors don’t just pick people who they think would be good for the job.</p>

<p>Some players would like to ban serious griefers as they are griefing, rather than being unable to play for several hours or even days (see the nick+jared cases, and jrub’s cases).</p>
<p>LilXCj - google? :S I was describing stack exchange, but they probably adapted the idea from somewhere else and people probably adapted the idea from stack exchange too.</p>

Anyone can report things and show they’re capable of following the global rules, but that doesn’t mean they should have power. Without a proper nomination and reviewing system in place someone who is potentially unstable and inadequate to hold such powers could wriggle their way in.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Did you even read my post? I know for a fact that when you tried to become a moderator, you simply reported things and followed the rules. I’m sure this is the case with other moderators, and I’m sure you’re going to tell me there’s some magical secret way of getting in. I don’t see anything wrong with this, I’m just saying that the current process of gaining power is not unlike an automated reputation system.[/quote]</p>
<p>How long would this system take for a person to achieve a lot of power is what I’m really asking I guess, if we’re talking it’s possible to do in a week then it’s a resounding no on my side. When you first join a community you kind of do want some form of award I guess, whether it be tutorial author or whatever but over years you tend not to care as much. If the system takes a long time to achieve a high enough reputation then I guess it is plausible, because time usually irons out any things you hoped for in the past.</p>
<p>So, how would you have it work if you made it? How would they earn it, how long would it take to obtain certain levels of power? You’re right humans can be biased which can have effects on the nomination process though. Maybe you could write a general plan for it, that would be great actually?</p>

<p>I can’t actually think of any successful real-world nomination based systems from the top of my head. For example, if you wanted to get in to a good school, it’d be more fair for them to give entrance grades than for the governors to sit in a circle and pick kids because they know their parents. If you want to work for a major bank, you apply, and they give you the job based on skills and experience - the board of directors don’t just pick people who they think would be good for the job.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When I was on my work experience the employer said to me that I may have the grades to work for him, but do I have the social skills? He told me not everything was done behind a computer. Last I heard there was no degree in talking to people, not that anyone has anyway.</p>
<p>How would this system account for peoples social skills in game? There attitude towards other players? Or more important their past record and behavior on the other mopar forums. It wouldn’t be that automatic if we had to check the chat logs to make sure they weren’t a complete idiot.</p>

Why would you even want this ban power anyway? It’s pointless for the most part. Why not wait for a staff member to come on and deal with it via bb rollback? I’m not a big fan of automatic systems on these matters.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Some players would like to ban serious griefers as they are griefing, rather than being unable to play for several hours or even days (see the nick+jared cases, and jrub’s cases).[/quote]</p>
<p>Why don’t they just kill them? After all PVP is enabled. If they’re online and see a griefer why not kill them? Besides they can still play just not in the griefed area (they should have res protected it anyway)</p>

<p>That sort of remind me of the current system, except when a moderator thinks you’re being honest he doesn’t tell you, but takes note for future reference that you could be a potential candidate for staff. As you said, but automatic etc…</p>

There is 2 things that stop this from coming true..
1. People like wo0tle speed hack, go see the video on his report, how do you expect me to catch them when they fly at 100 blocks per second/noclip?
2. Plus, they usually do it when im not near the railway, so they speed in, do their griefing, and leave, or when im not online/busy.
Bottomline, I cant stay on all day and somehow pay people to watch every 10 blocks of the railroad..... unless we can open something up were we can take a appointment to request a protection over certain items like railways, id wait the time for an appoitment and get it protected, would help a bunch.

Well if there are more people with the ability to deliver punishments, i see that as no different than staff tbh, considering they would have to be active users to get the “reputation” of a individual who can deliver these punishments.</p>

        <p>The reason I suggested a system like this is because there seems to be uncertainty in who mopar can trust to pick as staff. I can’t think of any other reason to have only 2 active mods on the game with the entire playerbase raging about lack of staff activity.</p>
<p>It would take a long time for people to get reputation the automatic way, so I now support the manual reputation idea. The automatic system could be a possibility later on, but right now we can’t be waiting around for months to let people build up rep. The staff could decide on some trustworthy users to give varying amounts of reputation to, which will let them vote on a ban. Higher rep members can get the user banned with less votes, etc. All bans will be reported to the real staff, so they can be checked later. Anyone that abuses the system can just have their reputation removed.</p>
<p>Better than just handing out full moderator positions to the chosen players, right? You get to see the best moderators by how they perform, and nobody can do any serious damage if they abuse it.</p>
<p>If anyone wants me to, I can suggest a list of trustworthy people and the rep I’d give them. I can also give a numerical example of the scale of reputation and how much ‘swing’ you’d get in a vote.</p>

        <p>Also, I feel we need a new trustworthy person to help administrate the server alongside MITB. Because we all know he can’t do it all himself.</p>
<p>Well, he can, but I just feel we need to take off that sort of workload.</p>
