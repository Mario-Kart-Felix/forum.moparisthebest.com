              <p>I thought people agreed the points would be given manually by official staff, not automatically from posting reports. It’s basically a more manageable way of distributing power around the server, rather than giving a few more staff members full power and running the risk of them abusing it. And as the power is distributed between active players, there’s more chance of being able to ban a rule breaker.</p>
<p>Staff giving players these points is almost exactly the same as giving players moderator status, only they have significantly less power. I’m not talking about handing the points out to everyone, just people who could potentially make good moderators but maybe can’t be trusted with full mod power.</p>

Nah thats too easy i think every 5 reports = 1 point.<br>

<p>unethical, not sure if youre considering the fact that if youre never griefed you wont need to post reports therefore you wont get any points…[/quote]If you rarely get griefed then you can just report on the forums as usual?</p>

No. No point system whatsoever.<br>

<p>it would just cause problems you could just get a bunch of points and then ban someone who annoys you lol[/quote]<br>
Yep, you would be able to spend months earning the reputation of the staff just to blow it all on someone who can just be unbanned. Oh wait, you can do that already.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/tom">@tom</a>, I’ll think up how much MC Points count for in a vote, and how long you have to wait before voting again, but only if mopar agrees because I’m 90% sure he wont do something as different as this.</p>
