        <p>[quote=“Tom_BETA, post:21, topic:408257”]You probably won’t understand my stance here, because most people who aren’t staff think you keep going like a steam engine forever (which isn’t true):</p>
<p>Moderators need motivating, it was alright when you first get promoted because you feel happy and energetic about your role, but as time goes on you just feel drained. It is an unavoidable phase, happens everywhere, even in jobs.</p>
<p>Getting new staff will only slow down the phase but eventually the reality will begin to kick in, and they will be tired of it. Staff need something to work for, something that will keep them wanting to go on and do reports.</p>
<p>This ongoing process of gaining new staff all the time would be stopped. As for me, I do try my best to do the reports but I’m starting to slow down as well now. I cannot help it!</p>
<p>PS most people on the server are idiots, or ban evaders. The few good ones just act like idiots. Unless you can prove me wrong?[/quote]</p>
<p>Well in relation to that statement you probably have an idea what can be done, what do you propose?</p>

        <p>I’ve made a discussion in the staff section regarding ideas, but they can be discussed here also. R</p>
<p>When you gain a staff position, you’re very happy that you’ve been given that chance but eventually that energetic feel goes away and you’re lumbered with a problem. That’s not the case for every staff member but for most of them that is the case.</p>
<p>Moderating a server requires a lot more effort than moderating a forum, especially for me because I have a horrible computer and have to drop everything I’m doing for a good &gt;1 hour to do it.</p>
<p>Instead of getting new staff all the time, I proposed we actually re motivate the current staff (which makes a lot more sense because they’re experienced and better at the job) businesses use techniques to motivate people, for example:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Fringe benefits (perks and so on)[/li][li]Recognition if they do something well (appraisal)[/li][li]A manager which actually speaks to them as a group (IRC meetings and so on)[/li][li]A staff team which gets along[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>There are some examples that businesses use, just tiny things which could make such a big difference in the way reports are handled because right now these slumps where nothing is happening isn’t good, at all.</p>
<p>I can already tell what’s coming from some members “Oh, that’s not the case with me!”. Maybe it’s not now, but I promise you it will be.</p>
<p>Feel free to suggest/debate on it, I’ll happily reply.</p>

        <p>What sort of perks are you suggesting? All mopar can give you is more power, which simply results in more work. Maybe after a certain number of bans you unlock multiplayer mopar pacman or something?</p>
<p>Recognition? So like, a pat on the back for banning a really bad griefer?</p>
<p>The problem is that being a moderator is treated as a promotion. Some people would be willing to pay to become staff, whereas it should be the other way around. New staff soon realise they’re doing quite a lot of work, and take that attitude of “oh I don’t have to solve every report/issue because I volunteer”. Mopar, you make a lot of money from advertising, so maybe offer a small monetary reward to productive moderators?</p>
<p>Any team of staff should get along, provided they’re not immature kids. Having a difference in opinion and having arguments is good because it promotes discussion and revision of outdated rules and ideas.</p>

        <p>When I said a staff team which gets along I was more referring to a business environment example. As far as paying goes, that will never happen. Staff is by the users choice so if they don’t want to do it then they shouldn’t take it (I believe that’s how it is said). The only things moparisthebest will spend the money on is open source things!</p>
<p>People say they want an IRC meeting as they feel it has a bigger impact then a topic in a section, but no one generally stands up and says so, it’s always the same so in the end nothing happens. It isn’t hard to set up a little meeting every now and then.</p>
<p>Moparisthebest does recognition alright, I guess. Anything from a “good” can be enough to motivate an existing member of staff for a small amount of time. But I guess you would call that appraisal, to be honest I have no idea what a good recognition system would be for this community nothing ever seems to change.</p>
<p>I think the issue is that Moparisthebest is very set with the way he has ran this community for a long time, which is understandable, so that means we would need one hell of an argument to ever get him to change it!</p>

        <p>I do my best to solve reports unless you (or some other staff) post that you are going to handle it. Usually the topic goes unsolved (not moved but actually is solved). I have all the motivation I could need to just log on and handle the situation. However, with the newest update, I see the lack of motivation to solve reports because the ban command is bugged. I’m also trying my best to convince my dad to get me a new 6GB RAM DDR3, 750GB-1TB Disk Drive Computer so I may participate more in the community (and other various emulation hackings and developments). I’m simply limited by hardware that actually allows me to stay motivated for long because it is frustrating.</p>
<p>Davidi2 disappeared (from this section of the websites and even before he got a job) and there’s no one to handle administration like it’s supposed to for a constantly changing server like this (and possible abuse). MITB is frequently on and as you said, he’s currently away but that doesn’t seem to be enough.</p>
<p>Is there any actual staff here besides me and Tom?</p>
<p>On the note of recognition and the witty comment by matty: I don’t exactly like how you put it, moderators (or at least me) would like to be recognized for what I do (not extreme to the point where you’re just trying to aggrivate me). We don’t exactly like being taken for granted as Moparisthebest’s sex slaves because you’re trying to poke fun. The “job” is frustrating and as Tom said, we lose motivation to continue moderating frequently and it dies down to every now and then.</p>
<p>As a server moderator I only understand a portion of the workload the global moderators for this forum. However, I find the server hard to moderate if moderators continually need photographic evidence and cannot immediately be at the scene of whatever rule is being broken (should it need an image). Which is why I feel we need teleportation rights so we can investigate the problems. We’re continually being limited to trusting the users.</p>
<p>Also; I want the revival of colored groups for moderators/admins. Mainly to allow users who don’t exactly read every single bit of info on the stickies can identify moderators through login messages or chat colors.</p>

        <p>[quote=“LilXCj, post:27, topic:408257”]I do my best to solve reports unless you (or some other staff) post that you are going to handle it. Usually the topic goes unsolved (not moved but actually is solved). I have all the motivation I could need to just log on and handle the situation. However, with the newest update, I see the lack of motivation to solve reports because the ban command is bugged. I’m also trying my best to convince my dad to get me a new 6GB RAM DDR3, 750GB-1TB Disk Drive Computer so I may participate more in the community (and other various emulation hackings and developments). I’m simply limited by hardware that actually allows me to stay motivated for long because it is frustrating.</p>
<p>Davidi2 disappeared (from this section of the websites and even before he got a job) and there’s no one to handle administration like it’s supposed to for a constantly changing server like this (and possible abuse). MITB is frequently on and as you said, he’s currently away but that doesn’t seem to be enough.</p>
<p>Is there any actual staff here besides me and Tom?</p>
<p>On the note of recognition and the witty comment by matty: I don’t exactly like how you put it, moderators (or at least me) would like to be recognized for what I do (not extreme to the point where you’re just trying to aggrivate me). We don’t exactly like being taken for granted as Moparisthebest’s sex slaves because you’re trying to poke fun. The “job” is frustrating and as Tom said, we lose motivation to continue moderating frequently and it dies down to every now and then.</p>
<p>As a server moderator I only understand a portion of the workload the global moderators for this forum. However, I find the server hard to moderate if moderators continually need photographic evidence and cannot immediately be at the scene of whatever rule is being broken (should it need an image). Which is why I feel we need teleportation rights so we can investigate the problems. We’re continually being limited to trusting the users.</p>
<p>Also; I want the revival of colored groups for moderators/admins. Mainly to allow users who don’t exactly read every single bit of info on the stickies can identify moderators through login messages or chat colors.[/quote]</p>
<p>Another thing that makes it difficult is, as stated earlier, is that it is a game. You want to play. And especially in a game like minecraft where involvement is constant (building, destroying, avoiding mobs, etc) you can’t stop, check the infractions, deal with it, and come back easily. And in that time, there could be an entirely new issue being developed in chat.</p>
<p>All in all, I believe what the current mods have stated about no more motivation and such. However, I do believe that there should be mods from a wider timezone range, so that the amount of time before an infraction is solved or a rollback is made is reduced.</p>

<p>^I agree with LilXCj, we have people on this community who would be willing to take very long periods of time to gain these powers, then would abuse them discretely for a while until they got caught. The number of people who would attempt this would just ruin it.</p>
<p>That may work on other mature communities with a much more adult based population, but the young teenagers which make up 70% of the communities population won’t be able to accept such responsibility.

<p><a class="mention" href="../../../u/zyle1992.html">@Zyle1992</a>: Exactly right, we have quite a young playerbase for the server which involves a lot of lying and trying to blame other people, and “it was my brother” based issues. Those are a lot easier to settle on the forums, but unfortunately it also demands you go ingame to get a clearer picture.</p>

<p>I agree. In more mature communities, rep doesn’t matter like it does here. The young teenagers that are so accustomed to having everything given to them and (in the US at least) the education system babies them along the way. “Oh, you don’t know basic algebra? Don’t worry, you’ll probably be an actor anyway”. So kids these days are passing, and even graduating knowing less than the absolute minimum, just to work at a burger joint. As such, they are accustomed that they don’t have to give any independent thought to a situation. Just blindly follow rules (or blindly disobey; whichever they’re told).</p>
<p>Also, that situation is definitely the most annoying to deal with. I was an admin on a few forums, and every so often, a player would go on a rampage, come back the next day, “Sorry about that guys, my brother hacked my account and was being a dick”.</p>

<p>Stereotypes exist for a reason. And the fact the the US has the lowest level of education compared to other first world countries, and me being through the US education system myself has shown me what shit it is.</p>
<p>All I’m saying is that people these days feel a sense of entitlement that is radically undeserved.</p>
