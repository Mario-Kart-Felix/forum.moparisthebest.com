    <title>(Making server Work) 317 based - Noob guide</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-server-work-317-based-noob-guide/453048</link>
    <description>Hey I am new around making forum topics. I have server my own, made lots of updates and got around 120 active players.. i never got around making forums topic to help anyone out. so I will start help people out on there servers. 

Things we are going to learn on client sided:
Fixing Compile and Run  ( for people who can&#39;t run server )
for webclient ready servers. I will teach you how to make your client cache downloader work.

NOTE: there no picture but I don&#39;t think there is need, 

1. make run and compile work:
Update jdk on google.co.uk, 
Once downloaded JDK - 
Go to the location and copy paste the url of location. so mine says : C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_05
i guess if you don&#39;t have (program files (x86) it would look like this C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_05
go to your run server or compiler. right click then edit, change Their JDK into yours. 
then everything should run smoothly. 

2. How to get Downloading cache working: 
client sided:
go to sign/Signlink 
search for: 
public static String findcachedir() {

you should see  String s = &quot;&quot;); 
with server name on their.. just change that to your server name, 

Now we sort out your cache, go to your cache. GO INSIDE the cache folder, Highlight all all your files, right click, add achieve. 
then zip folder. then put name you want, 
create a dropbox account and put zip cache there, once upload done, right click - copy public link: 

Next at cachedownloder.java 
Search: private String cacheLink = 
it should have location of cache, change and put yours 

next at client.java
search: drawLoadingText(0, &quot;Connecting to File Server...&quot;);
under it should have cache location.zip.  change that to yours. also next to that it has name.zip, change that to your cahcename.zip

then compile then it should work!

sorry not much on this tut, I will add more when i am not busy. 
This is a noob guide of people who can&#39;t understand server coding.........

This is my first forum posting and you will expect more from me :) and also better things that could help you with your server.
If there anything i should mention or add, please comment, il see what  i can do ^_^</description>
