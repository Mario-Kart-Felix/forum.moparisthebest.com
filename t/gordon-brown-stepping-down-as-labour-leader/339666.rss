&lt;blockquote&gt;Gordon Brown has said he is stepping down as Labour Party leader - as his party opens formal talks with the Lib Dems about forming a government.
Mr Brown, prime minister since 2007, said he hoped a successor as Labour leader would be in place by September.
The Lib Dems have been negotiating for days with the Tories - who won the most seats and votes in the UK election.
But the Lib Dems have asked for formal talks with Labour. Mr Brown said it was in the &quot;national interest&quot; to respond.
Mr Brown&#39;s statement will be seen as a move to smooth the way to a deal between Labour and the Liberal Democrats to form a government.
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said it was an audacious bid by Mr Brown to keep Labour in power - and himself in power for a limited period.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
