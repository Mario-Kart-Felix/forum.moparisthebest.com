    <title>Which country would you fight for?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-country-would-you-fight-for/363156</link>
    <description>With all the patriotism and arguments about different countries on this forum, I thought this [i]might[/i] be a nice topic. But lets take a completely made up scenario, I&#39;m not suggesting this could happen, I&#39;m not asking for debate around who could do what, and all this, but purely:

If your country had been taken over or destroyed by another, doesn&#39;t matter which one, which other country, given the choice, would you then take alliance with? Which do you think would be worth helping to save other than your own? 

This is more of a culture thing, what other countries do you think would be worth - potentially your life, saving? Politics is mostly out of the question, ignore what you think about the government and military power, think about the people and culture.

Give your reasons, too.</description>

<p>That isn’t a riot. I had first hand experience of these protests, walking through them at manchester - and they certainly weren’t riots - not with the amount of school children being around there.</p>
<p>I have said it before, I’m happy to join in with these debates with you, but you do come out with some shit.</p>

<p>Not really, even our unemployment statistic isn’t right. It doesn’t show you the people showing up for job interviews in flipflops and being late etc.</p>
<p>How do you measure happiness… You mean like riots in the UK and greece?</p>
<p>We could be like European countries if we wanted to in a heart beat.</p>

Mostly economy though, because when you give all your money to the other two you lose what you had in the first place.</p>
