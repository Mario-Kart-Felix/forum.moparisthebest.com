    <description>Maybe I&#39;ll release them Im not completely sure. The reason i did this is because Im not see any original server, most server looks like a knockoff of Czar. The idea of releasing a server is for someone to take off were you left off thus a server would develop into something better.

[b][u]Some side information[/u][/b] - The client i used it Java Got Me Stoned, I used it purposely for his chat box but the items that came with his client were 85% messed up, and i took the time to fix them now there are a total of 140 items all correctly added.

[b]Enjoy the pictures provided[/b]
