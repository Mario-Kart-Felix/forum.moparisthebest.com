    <description>hello, i have just made a brand new server. the only problem is im not a coding champ. i would like to ask for two of your guys help to create my leeched trisidiaX rsps into a non-leeched-unique-server in which many people would like to play ;)

---requirements---
-access to skype.
-access to paypal

i am not allowed to talk about payment on here so skype me (henpopped swag) or email me at (joeyfim@yahoo.com)

i will pay for web hosting, vps, etc. but i will not right off the bat. once everything is settled and some money comes my way ill get right to it. but obviously. no money will come my way if nobody is changing the server. thats where you come in.

i will try and contact you back within 24 hours. kind regards - lord18

---additional information---
-the server is not up yet, for the files you will have to contact me via skype or email.
-i am also looking for somebody who can develop a website including forums, vote, highscores and communication such as personal messages. 
-i am looking for somebody who is very active and friendly in the community. not somebody who codes once a week. thank you.</description>
