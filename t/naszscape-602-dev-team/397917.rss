    <description>[size=14pt]NaszScape 602[/size] &lt;- Until I can get a banner ^^.

Server Name: NaszScape
Server Deob/Revision: 602 (562 loading).


Anywho.. So recently I&#39;ve been working on like a 562 loading 602, and since it&#39;s Summer Time I&#39;d really like to get this working and probably be the best 562 loading 602 EVAR... so... what I really wanna achieve with this is a really great server and that it&#39;s really stable and fun, but I don&#39;t really wanna do it alone cuz it gets kinda boring =p. But anyways, let&#39;s get started &lt;3 :

                                  [i][b]†Features†:[/b][/i]

~ All 24 Skills Work.
~ Clan-Chat.
~ A great working loot-share system for the Clan.
~ An oke friends list.
~ First server with working Quest Tab for 562+ I Think.
~ Soulwars.
~ Wildy PvP as well as Red-Zone Clan-Wars for 1v1, and Wildy is Multi-Zone. White Portal is safe.
~ Banking with Tabs.
~ Dungeoneering Armour.
~ Many more... x]

But.. it can be a whole lot more better, as we can add Dungeoneering, and Dungeoneering tokens system so that Players can actually obtain Chaotics/Arcane Neclaces/Dungeoneering Stuff Basicly legitly. But other stuff do need to be fixed as well, so the server is less buggy and more &quot;co-operable&quot; too work with, cuz sometimes creating on Quests can just lead to confusion. So, some of the things that would be nice too add are:

~ Working Dungeoneering (Although we don&#39;t have the skill tab, we can always do a ::dungexp or ::dunglvl, which will display either or, or possibly update to just a 604 Client.)
~ Working Dungeoneering Tokens System. (not hard too add at all.)
~ Working Lunars. (Other Vengeance, etc.)
~ High Alching.
~ Random Events
~ Working Quests
~ Minigames
~ Cursed Prayers
~ Etc.. it goes on. ^^

But I&#39;ll post more info later, cuz it&#39;s 4am, so I&#39;ll post pics, other features, and all that tomarrow.. I&#39;m not the best 562+ coder by far.. but I&#39;m definately not the worse &gt;.&gt; I have my vouches here and there.. but for now I&#39;ll put other information.

   [i][b]Donations...[/b][/i]

For the Donations, we will only accept RuneScape Gold or Xats from xat.com. Only because my paypal is currently not working due to my mom cut off my credit card for buying pizza from pizza hut after school and then buying a pair of $89.99 Nike Airforce shoes, but yea.. I need a credit card to verify before I can even use paypal again. So if someone happens too join our Dev team with a working Paypal then that would be great, so we could buy a domain name for our website, etc. All donations will be split equally though with the people on the Dev team, but please don&#39;t join just for this, as we won&#39;t accept you if we notice you slack in coding. The Donation cost is basically 1M RSGP, so if we had 5 people on our Dev team, then everyone would get 200k. 

Other info I guess should really go on the Server Development page, due to it&#39;s questions as in the Server being released, hosting, websites, etc. But yeah.. thanks too whoever applies and we don&#39;t care if you&#39;re rep is bad, you&#39;ll still have a try at it ^.^. (We will only accept 5 Developers though.. so I&#39;ll wait a while before I choose. If you have MSN, you can add me at jaykayyz@hotmail.com or I&#39;ll be on RuneScape High Alching user is &quot;Bluejayy&quot;, (only 40k alchs til 99 mage, lvl 96 atm ^^), and we can talk wherever either webchat/microphone/text.

So.. copy &amp;&amp; paste the app, you can either qualify for Quest Writer, Server Coder, Client Developer, more later.. (also we don&#39;t care how long you&#39;ve been coding/programming, just atleast be a bit good at it.)

So copy &amp;&amp; paste:

Name:
Age:
Applying For: [Quest Writer] [Server Coder\Programmer] or [Client Developer]
If you&#39;ve ever worked on any other server, go ahead and post some links or whatever verify, remember it doesn&#39;t count, just verifies that you know what your doing and you may have a better chance.</description>
