              <p>alright there are a many different ways to make a webclient, this is the easiest i think.<br>
step 1. go to google and type rs-ps<br>
step 2. click on create a web client in top left hand corner.<br>
step 3. click accept in the gray box.<br>
step 4. fill out information, leave Coupon / Offers blank, for client base use delta base, create a safe password one that you can remember, set up to your ip and port (if your server is not online it will connect to a different server) and again (if your server is not online it will connect to a different server),</p>
<p>once you have filled out that information you should save the links to control panel and the webclient link for if you wont to put it on forums or send to people.<br>
to login to the control panel use the ‘server name’ you made when creating the webclient.</p>
<p>any problems post here.</p>
