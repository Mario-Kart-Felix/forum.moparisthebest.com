CB900F Supersport

Dunno what it is about these bikes, but I&#39;ve always loved them, even when I was only riding dirt bikes in fields for lulz. They don&#39;t like corners much, they provide 0 protection against the elements... but they&#39;re huge, torquey as fuck and just great fun

got one for essentially nothing, needs work but nothing a little mopman tlc will not cure

&lt;- happy man
