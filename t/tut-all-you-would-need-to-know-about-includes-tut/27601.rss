    <title>[Tut]All You Would Need To Know About Includes[Tut]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-all-you-would-need-to-know-about-includes-tut/27601</link>
    <description>Hello thank you for looking at my Tut on:
[center][size=16pt][/size][b]Includes![/b][/center]

  If you are looking to make your own include and dont quite know how includes work or how to do it then folow this tut.
  To start off i shall explain what includes are for you, includes are basicily what very nice people make to make scripting alot easier for people. The main one peopel use is SRL to downlaod it go to villu-reborn.com.
Includes are jsut a script full of different procedures and functions that you can add to your script here is a example.
[code]procedure Write(Txt : string);
begin
  WriteLn(Txt)
end;
[/code]This is the include.
Now this could be your script.
[code]procedure P-Report;
begin
  DoStuff;
  Write(&#39;Hello people&#39;)
end;[/code]This could be your script, bascilly it does what is in the procedure in the include in this case its called &#39;Write&#39;.
I hope this answered your questions.

[center][b]Making Your Include[/b][/center]
To make a include you need a good knowlegde of scar and  and thats about it.
First off make your include and if someone gave you a procedure or function to put in it make sure you give them credits aswell. Once you have done save it C:/Program Files/ Scar 2.03/Includes
And then  all you need to do this add somethign like this:
[code]{.Include (YOURINCLUDESNAME).Scar}[/code] If you add that under program; or somewhere before all the procedures that will load your include and let you use the stuff you put inside.
Thank you for lookign at my Tut i hoep this gets moved to the tut section :D

This tells me nothing of what an include is.
And this is not really a guide to making an include.
It looks quite rushed, and half of it is incorrect.
