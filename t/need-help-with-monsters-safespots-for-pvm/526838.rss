    <title>Need help with monsters/safespots for pvm</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-monsters-safespots-for-pvm/526838</link>
    <description>Hi is there anyway to make npcs not able to attack through walls or walk through safespots. For example I am creating donator island and I want my kbd to be safespotable behind the wall. It attacks with mage also, so it mages through the wall. Is there anyway I can make it not mage or not be able to hit through safespots?</description>
