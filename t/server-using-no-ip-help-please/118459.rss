    <title>!server using no-ip! HELP PLEASE!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-using-no-ip-help-please/118459</link>
    <description>Hi guys, I need some help on making a server which uses no-ip. I am currently unsure how to do this since I am a noob to computers :D
so to sum it all up I would like some basic instruction even I could understand from step 1 (choosing a server to work on, and to edit)
and to the last stage (getting the server to run and get other people on it) Thanks guys for reading this I hope you can give me a noob guide on how to create a server with the host to be a no-ip one. At least give me a link please :) once again thanks for reading this post and thanks for your help if you give me any :D chears :D</description>
