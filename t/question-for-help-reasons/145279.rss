    <title>QUESTION, for help reasons</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-for-help-reasons/145279</link>
    <description>ok well i got a question.

ok well to start off, i am makeing a source from start and me and a friend are running it. how can me and my friend run it on two diffrent computers at 2 diffrent locations?

after one is done running do i have to send it to him after i added to archive? and he reopens everything? or is there a auto updater that can update it when one is running and the other is off? like he runs it when im not home and i run it when im home and its always on with same stats and evverything?
