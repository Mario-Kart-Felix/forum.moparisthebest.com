    <description>OK this is my First tutorial but it should help noobs fix compile errors. 

Purpose: Fixing Compile Errors.

Difficulty: 3, 4 max

Assumed Knowledge: How to use &quot;Search&quot;, C/P, edit compile file.

Server Base: ALL!!!!

Step 1: ok first thing you MUST have the latest version of JDK, and you MUST have the Java Runtime Environment files downloaded.

Step 2: Use  Search (Start &gt; Search) and find the following files.

Files: Javac, and Java

Step 3: ok now open the file thats on the list that says Javac. Then you should see an address bar that says something like &quot;C: Owner\Documents and Settings\Program Files\Java\jre\bin&quot; or somthing else in that manner. copy the address and open up your compiler.

Step 4. In your compiler you should see a line that says &quot;javac&quot; at the end of it. Paste the address you copied from the search menu to replace the code that is there.

Step 5. Do Steps 2-5 again; but instead of javac, search java.

Step 6. MAKE SURE JAVAC AND JAVA HAVE THE JAVA SYMBOL (BLUE CUP) NEXT TO THEM.

Step 7. Save and Exit, run the compiler and it should work. any problem post here. and ill help you with them.</description>

              <p>Thanks. None of the other “how to make your own server” compilers worked so i had to figure it out for my self. all of the others are generic locations for the java. so the address is the most important thing in the compiler.[br][size=1]Posted at: November 16, 2006, 06:44:40 PM[/size][hr]i hope this is helpful</p>
