              <p>Mhm i know that and I know how to change the ice barrage speed. I want to add an exception so that when a certain weapon is equipted the ice barrage timer is increased causing the ice barrage to barrage faster.</p>

<p>I don’t think you can completely CHANGE the speed of ONE weapon, but you’ll have to increase the Ice Barrage speed as IS. Because as the server runs, it’s taking from the file that already SHOWS the ice barrage speed. :]</p>
