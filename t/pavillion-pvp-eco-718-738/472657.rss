CACHE UPDATED TO 738;[

About us- 

Pavillion was started as a small server in the summer of 2012, but eventually went down. It is now being brought back as a completely new, revolutionary server created by Maxed. We are a 718 loading 738 server and we strive to become and WILL become the #1 RSPS ever. With loads of features, a friendly community, and a helpful staff team, it’s easy to set ourselves apart from what you’d call “the competition”. We PROMISE you that in no time, you will become part of the Pavillion family. Whether a pker, a merchant, a skiler, or a bosser - Pavillion is for you! Anything you dreamt to have in a server, pavillion brings to life.

Staff spots are open.. so come on and have a go (: [Don&#39;t ask in game, submit your application]
