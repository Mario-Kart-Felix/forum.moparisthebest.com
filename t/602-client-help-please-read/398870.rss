    <description>My client and webclient have recently been acting up.
I have heard that for some reason everyone&#39;s cache downloader isn&#39;t working.
If you would be kind enough to go check out the error im getting from my webclient:
www.realitypkwebclient.tk , and maybe explain how to fix here or
Msn me at :
bulletz2011@live.com
I would very muchly appreciate it.
Also i&#39;m having some trouble with my client , not the cacheloader, but the client its self.
When i try and run it , it wont work but i have 7 players online capable of playing.
I have checked Ip, I have checked ban.
I can&#39;t seem to find anything
If you help with that i am willing to pay 10 $ paypal.</description>
