    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Life is nothing but a blur,
every time I turn, something new to occur.
A death, a wreck, so sad, so tragic,
I feel as if the world is some kind of wretched magic.
All of this happening so quickly,
All i want to do is flee.
Run, Skip, none of it matters,
The world just keeps getting sadder.

People getting mad,
Others being sad.
Its a confusing place,
You can hardly recognize the same face.

The alcohol, the cars,
We should send it all to Mars.
A wretched and deadly combination,
Has complete world domination.
Michelle, may you rest in peace,
and all of this irresponsibility come to cease.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What has this terrible war cost?<br>
Comfort is the key,<br>

The earth hears my sadness.<br>
Why can’t you see<br>
this is a war of madness?</p>
<p>Grieve with me<br>
My own country doesn’t know my name.<br>
I risked my life for free,<br>
how can this life of mine ever be the same?</p>
<p>Grieve with me<br>
I feel as one with the Lost Generation<br>
falling to one knee.<br>
Oh death, sweep me away from this creation!</p>
<p>Grieve with me,<br>

Grief has made this the end</p>

<p>A Shred of Victory</p>
<p>As I traipse the battlegrounds,<br>
there are but many sounds<br>
to be heard among the lines.<br>
All is pointed by many signs.</p>
<p>I have but one shred of victory,<br>
despite my own valedictory.<br>
The battle has been fought and won,<br>
yet this raging war is far from done.</p>
<p>This war will surely never end,<br>
yet to the skies I do extend<br>
my every hope and devotion.<br>
Success is my single emotion.</p>
<p>The light dawns upon a new day,<br>
life grows more difficult in this array<br>
of growing toil and devastation.<br>
Upon the hill is my salvation.</p>
<p>Success is finally at my feet.<br>
This war and this fight I have beat.<br>
I have overcome the adversity;<br>
my emotions, at last, have diversity.</p>
<p>One must keep his head held high,<br>
for victory draws nearly nigh.<br>
The conflict has been overthrown,<br>
a new one begun-- as will be shown.</p>

              <p>This is a poem i did today in creative writing.</p>
<blockquote>I'm all alone with no one to love
They are all gone and i sit here in the corner
The corner of my loneliness and sorrow
I'm in the room of my pain and suffering
While all my demons harass me
I look to the opposite corner from where i was sitting. . .nothing
I look up and down, side to side. . .still nothing
I slowly clasp my hands over my chest and forcefully start to tear
And the place where my heart rests. . .nothing
And so now i'm all alone not knowing how to love</blockquote>
<p>I know it sucks, but please don’t flame</p>

<p>Humanitiy’s a failed experiment<br>

<p>The earth will shake and the waters will rise<br>
the elements reclaim what was taken<br>

<p>The skyline is set ablaze<br>
with regret<br>
ashes cover a falling<br>
silhouette<br>
The city will reap what it’s sewn<br>

watching as the city burns<br>

<p>Blindly consuming mass manufactured faith<br>

<p>Blindly consuming mass manufactured faith<br>
mankind is a festering parasite<br>

Tonight</p>
<p>Only after the last tree’s cut<br>
and the last river poisoned<br>
only after the last fish is caught<br>
will you find that money cannot be eaten</p>
<p>When everything becomes irrelevant<br>
When the sky tears open<br>
fire rains down, fire rains down<br>
the 4th world comes to an end<br>
push the button, light the match<br>
feel the fault lines detach<br>
crosshairs in the evening light<br>
I sit and watch the city burn<br>
Tonight</p>
<p>The city burns tonight</p>
