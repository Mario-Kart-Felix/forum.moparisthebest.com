    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/do-you-mind/154303</link>
    <description>Well, Again, Recently i have put a topic on what should i post for a tutorial, Cause i have nothing to do, And without my job for 1 more week, I have alot of spare time on my hands, And people liked my idea of posting a tutorial on how to get a Command Generator on some batch files, So the thing is

[b]Do you care if i post a topic on how to get command generators on batch files[/b]

If you do, Tell me the reason, Weather you think its going to be copy and paste, People should find out for them selves and so forth.

If you don&#39;t mind, Tell me if there is anything i shouldn&#39;t post, Copy and paste-able scripts, So forth.

So if you could post a reply, Thanks, I really need it.</description>
