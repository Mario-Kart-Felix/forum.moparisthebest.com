    <title>The RuneFocus Revival - 317, 2006 attempt</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-runefocus-revival-317-2006-attempt/534759</link>
    <description>Hello. As a lot of members know that I&#39;m a 317 fanatic, I love everything that brings back memories about RuneScape. I already had an attempt to make a RS 2006 remake, which was going quite good and I lot of people loved that project when it got released. My first attempt was called [b]xEpicz[/b], you can check it out [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=514973.0]here[/url]. I don&#39;t care if some1&#39;ll say that rs 2007 came back, it doesn&#39;t matter for me. I found pleasure on coding servers and bringing back memories my way, so I would like a team that will work together and have fun while working on the project. Yes, I&#39;m still working on the 194, for a couple of days it will be released. :)
