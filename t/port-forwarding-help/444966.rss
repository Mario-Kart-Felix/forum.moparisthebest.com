    <description>I&#39;ve port forwarded 43594 on tcp, put my firewall to access 43594 in tcp &amp; I went a canyouseeme.org. It told me it cannot see my 43594. I double checked everything in my router &amp; the firewall to see if it was good and it was, still no luck. I got uTorrent and port forwarded there, and got some luck. In the website it said, it can access 43594 in my ip, but I can not log onto my server within localhost or any ip. I downloaded various other programs and canyouseeme.org said 43594 is accessible, but I simply CAN&#39;T log onto localhost while it&#39;s running. I exited the programs and then I could log onto localhost, 0.0.0.0 &amp; 127.0.0.1. What can be the problem? I&#39;ve port forwarded many times, and even reset my router. I&#39;ve had others do it over team viewer and still no luck. What can I do? :mad:</description>
