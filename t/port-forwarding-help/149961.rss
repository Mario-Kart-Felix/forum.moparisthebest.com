We will list a series of lines here that will show you exactly how to forward the ports you need to forward. 1st SMTP Server requires you to forward the 25 ports. Go ahead and enter the settings shown above into the Game or Application Definition menu and then click Apply. 

Click the Apply button near the top of the page.
