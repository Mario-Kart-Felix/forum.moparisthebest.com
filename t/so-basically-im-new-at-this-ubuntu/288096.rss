    <title>So basically I&#39;m new at this. + Ubuntu</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-basically-im-new-at-this-ubuntu/288096</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve looked around at all of these clients but because I&#39;m using ubuntu vs Windows I haven&#39;t been able to get anything except Moparscape&#39;s Web Based Client to work. I really have no idea how to get these other clients to work because Linux doesn&#39;t use .bats to execute the files it uses Shell scripts which I don&#39;t know how to make to let these Run.

So basically if you can help me out by providing me a good RSC (or RS2) server / client running on my computer I would be appreciated. Also would like other people on it besides myself because I have no idea how to do this.

Oh yes I sound like a total noob. How fun. I just want to kill some stuff with max stats and whatever I want to wear without risk. That would be nice.

EDIT: Also there wasn&#39;t a general help place so I decided to ask here. I hope it&#39;s okay.</description>
