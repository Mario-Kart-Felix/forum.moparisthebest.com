    <title>What do you think?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-think/422304</link>
    <description>Would you think this game is worth getting back into if you had to start from scratch once again?  Now with huge amounts of bots gone, you could actually train.

I haven&#39;t played in almost 2 years now, I want to see if being a noob is as fun as it used to be.  My old account was hacked, so it discourages me a bit, but would it be worth raising an account up again, or should I stick to just playing Terraria and Minecraft?</description>

              <p>Don’t think so. If you’ve been a member with a high level account you probably won’t find it enjoyable to be a newbie again since you’re like missing adventure.</p>
<p>It was more fun at the beginning when you were learning new stuff about the game everyday while training your account.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I just wanted to know if that sense of adventure and awe (yes I rollplay when I play games) was still there after they turned it into a child’s playground a couple years ago.</p>
