    <title>What Do You Think?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-think/407566</link>
    <description>Thinking of releasing a PK server with xp rate AROUND 10x (community will decide) using the RSCA source with a few tweaks.

Idea: Once you reach 99 in a stat you can change that stat between 1-99.

For example, if you train Attack to 99, you will be able to change your attack level from 1 - 99
same goes for Defense, Strength, Magic, Prayer and Ranged.
You can only do this once you reach 99 in that stat

How long the server will stay up and running depends on the support from community tbh.

Who would be up for playing...

Everyone is entitled to an opinion I guess...</description>

I do think it’s a poor choice to release another failed concept. Given the history of what this community has created, it seems to be repeats of failed concepts and poor leadership. Since some developers have already created the foundation, take steps towards educating yourself in basic programming concepts and learn to improve the current code, then execute new ideas that you are confident with rather than asking few possible players. I myself won’t bother since I feel this game has lost it’s appeal over the years with constant failure.<br>

<p>How is that relevant? With some close examination, one could of gathered that I’m here because I had an interest in <span class="bbcode-b">RSC Development</span>, which seems to be close to non-existent here. After examining your previous posts, perhaps you should ask yourself that, considering most of it is passing judgement on others and adding spam.</p>
<p>OT: Another idea would be also to tackle the current client, some good refactoring and dead code removal would help ease the experience. Even using the latest MC, would be a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>If there’s a private server let me know lol, &lt;3 Zelda[/quote]I have seen zelda clones like <a href="http://www.lgdb.org/game/zelda_mystery_solarus_dx" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.lgdb.org/game/zelda_mystery_solarus_dx</a> and some zeldalike servers like slothrpg and maybe stendhal (ariannerpg engine) both are java. No 3D yet.</p>
<p>On topic: Since u want to do a pking server, maybe u could make high lvl monsters drops rune bars, then take the bars and cash to a npc who can make the armor or weapon out of them (get 5 rune bars from killing elvarg + 100k for a rune plate). Looks a bit diferent to me.</p>
