              <p>ROFL, Please leave my topic, You just made a complete ass of yourself on moparscape forums, What can i add to my server? L2Read , I want to add stuff to my Utility.</p>
<p>Also, I never said people “<span class="bbcode-b">NEED</span>” to give me ideas, For all you no i could be talking about, What do you think about my idea of adding all different compiles to suit your java.</p>
<p>Idiot, Leave my topic, I don’t want a 12 year old “Try hard” On this topic, Better yet, Leave these forums, Moparscape doesn’t need another one of you.</p>

              <p>I didn’t spam you, I merely posted a reply saying "Do not post topics with the name “Help me” , And it doesn’t say “Be as descriptive as possible” it says “Try to be as descriptive as you can” If i tried to be as descriptive as possible , Everyones topic name would have 15+ Words in it, And then the forums will be covered in spam.</p>
<p>If mine was as descriptive as i can make it, It would be:</p>
<p>“What do you think i should add to my “Dog eats Dog” Server utility so i can make it a v6”</p>
<p>Now please, Stop spamming here, Fill my inbox up with crap, See if i care, You have already broken 3 rules today.</p>
