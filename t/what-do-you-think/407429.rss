    <title>What do you think?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-think/407429</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve heard a lot of stories about kids as young as 13 thinking of these simple websites that people enjoy, and becoming millionaires from them. Most of you know of Facebook, Created by a boy in college. He was a jerk, but is a billionaire. He stole the idea from 2 rich people and made it into something WAY better. If any of you have seen the movie &quot;The Social Network&quot; you&#39;ve seen the whole story. But what brings this into my mind is that a lot of people here on moparscape are capable of creating these things. I saw something on the News the other day of some 16 year old and her little brother creating something like Facebook except you meet people you don&#39;t know.. They made like 5 million dollars from it then some company bought it for 100 Million Dollars. A lot of people on here, and all over the world are capable of doing this.. They just need to think, and be more creative. We could see someone on this site right now on the News tomorrow because of some simple Program/Website they invented that ALOT of people could have done, but didn&#39;t think of. This really gets me to thinking as it got a lot of other people to think after Facebook was created. I&#39;ve seen atleast 3 stories about kids becoming rich over something they made, that anyone could of done.. but didn&#39;t think of. What do you guys think about all this? All of you should start thinking because YOU could be the next person on the News that becomes a billionaire! :)</description>

Itd be cool because so many people here have potential. But itd be kind of weird for the people knowing the program was created by people that come from a “not so good” background like moparscape. I mean, after all, it is a cheat/exploit forum, private servers are illegal.<br>

<p>One question I have never really asked… Does RuneScape know about this website? If so why don’t they shut it down?[/quote]<br>
They know about us and google, they don’t do anything because our comunity is lazy and doesn’t really do much and because they can’t really legally do anything to stop us, emulation is legal. Also access to information isn’t illegal. Here you can read up on this if you want, explains it a little more. <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/lawstuff" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/lawstuff</a></p>

<p>There are a few people here who have created pretty decent programs and games, most of them are on Moparisthebest though. Also private servers aren’t illegal, there emulation. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Btw, this community has potential. What’s lacking is the ability to achieve a certain level of creativity. Skill is basically there, as it’s not hard to make something small and get a lot of money… It’s just the idea you need to worry about.</p>
