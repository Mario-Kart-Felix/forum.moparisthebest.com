    <title>What do you think?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-think/148340</link>
    <description>  Well, I was looking over my old account, Exe626. I found the ban quite astounding on the lack of proof an/or evidence towards my offense. I know for a fact I did not use 3rd party programs with Runescape(does SS(swift switch) count?). I didn&#39;t begin my cheating days until perm-ban hit me. Looking over what they&#39;ve told me and why I was banned, I&#39;ve come to a solution;

   Costumer Support is a bunch of monkeys beating on a keyboard all day.

  Why do I say this? I was banned for [url=https://offenceappeal.runescape.com/id/-7721246669673896687/rule.ws?id=7]Rule 7[/url], in which I did not. By reading what they have told me for the offensive after my Query, I received this message:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thank you for your appeal.

We are sorry to inform you that this appeal has been denied.

We have conclusive evidence that you committed the offence and for this reason this offence will remain on your account.

We suggest you take some time to remind yourself of the Rules of RuneScape before you start playing again!

RuneScape Customer Support&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   Okay. So after reading that I thought, &quot;What evidence?&quot; - So out of curiosity I checked the evidence to see why I was banned, guess what I found?

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sorry, no evidence is available for this offence.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
NOT ONLY THAT THEY SPELLED OFFENSE WRONG.

  But the point in this post is that Jagex bans wrongfully, I&#39;ve found myself banned out of several accounts;
Exe626
Archr
Mastr_Mage
  Also, locked from:
Dwayne654321 (I missed this account a lot).
  Does costumer support actually look over the report or anything they ban you for? If I remember correctly on Exe626, I was walking from Al-kahard towards Varrock, D/C, ban. On Archr, I was in the wild pking like always(since 80+ ranged was high to pk in non-members at the time, I pretty much pwnd), D/C, ban, I&#39;m still yet to figure out how I was macro-pking. On Mastr-Mage I was killing Lesser demons on Karamja(still in early stage, only about 60 mage, getting ready for membership), D/C, ban. 
  On Dwayne654321, I was in Seers Village, cutting mages like I always did, D/C while in the middle of a trade on the RS forums! Locked, unable to unlock. I fear they ban you once you get to a certain point in the game just for the hell of it.</description>

              <p>Yea, I’m in the US, and this offense was after the update(Anything before the update is considered a Legacy punishment). But by telling me they have sufficient evidence that I did this, then not showing me any evidence, wouldn’t that be considered stealing from me? I had just under a month left of membership on my Exe626 account, banned for no reason, stolen?</p>
<p>Ok, I sent a message to Jagex;</p>
<blockquote>Hello,
My account, Exe626, has been banned for over a year now for false causes. If I remember correctly it was for using 3rd party software, in which I have never used before. The most thing I've use with Runescape at the time was SS(Swift Switch) which I hadn't been aware that it was against the rules. I was hoping you would take the time to look over my account, because I dislike the loss of it.</blockquote>
<p>Hoping Jagex wouldn’t send another Automated message, I was amazed to find this;</p>
<blockquote>Dear Exe626,
<p>Thank you for your question.</p>
<p>Appeals sent in via the customer support query system will not be considered - we will only consider appeals made through the appeal module - this is because we have a system (which we recently improved) to deal with appeals, and we need to focus on answering game related messages through the query system.</p>
<p>If you have been permanently or temporarily banned or muted then you will be able to see this when you log in to the Account Management section from the main page of <a href="http://RuneScape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">RuneScape.com</a>. There you will see a list of your offences and links providing you with the evidence. If no evidence is shown to you for any reason (such as legacy, macroing, account theft, offensive name, bug abuse, or real world trading evidence), it will still be available for viewing by our staff.</p>
<p>Note that we can not always make the evidence available to you, if it would reveal details about our offence detection systems.</p>
<p>We review each appeal fairly and as quickly as we can, so it will not take long for you to be able to see the outcome of your appeal.</p>
<p>If your appeals have been denied and you are permanently banned you may apply for a last chance. If they have been denied and you are temporarily banned you will be allowed back into the game once the ban expires. In both cases, the black marks will remain on your account permanently.</p>
<p>If you have received black marks for rule breaking while already on a last chance then your account will remain permanently banned with no further chance to appeal. Last chances are intended to be just that, a last chance (please note that in certain situations a last chance will not be offered). If this is your situation then further messages from your account will be blocked, as we consider the issue closed.</p>
<p>No items or skills are transferable from a banned account under any circumstances.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding any banning issues, be sure to read the F.A.Q section of our knowledge base, rather than sending in a query as this will answer the vast majority of your questions.</p>
<p>You can find this on <a href="http://www.runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.runescape.com</a> <a href="http://www.runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.runescape.com</a> in: - Knowledge Base Home &gt; Customer Support &gt; Bans and mutes.</p>
<p>Any membership on a banned account will be cancelled at your next billing date automatically; credit already on the account cannot be refunded or transferred.</p>
<p>Good Luck. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Please always refer to the RuneScape Knowledge Base to find the answer to your queries quicker.</p>
<p>You can also find help on all free player and all new member quests through the QuestHelp system.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely<br>
Mod Bean</p>

<p>Exe, before the whole ‘ban appeal update’ they wouldn’t even offer to show you the evidence (if there was any). Your account must have been banned before the update.</p>
<p>I think you’re just unlucky.</p>
<p>P.S. Offence is mainly used in the UK as to break rules. Dealing illegal drugs is an offence. But, in sport, by cheating, you commit an offense. It’s because you’re from the US. (I guess you are, anyway)</p>

<p>Hmm, I don’t remember exactly what I was doing before I was banned/locked, but I do remember this:</p>
<p>On exe626: I was fletching(going for 85 at the time)<br>
Mastr_Mage: I was fishing for lobster to train(like always?)<br>
Archr: Well Archr never really left Edge ville.<br>
Dwayne: Erm, woodcutting.</p>
<p>The thing I’m finding hard to believe is, how can you conclude I’m autoing if I’m talking to people while doing these things, and/or taking small breaks during so.</p>
<p>[quote=“Casey., post:3, topic:148340”]They never have enough evidence.</p>
<p>I got banned for saying how to avoid a hack, the interpreted it as me telling others to break rules.[/quote]Yes, I’ve been muted for 1-2 weeks for saying such things, usually I was telling them how to get out of a lie test, but I’ve mentioned hack once or twice.</p>

              <p>Well, I was looking over my old account, Exe626. I found the ban quite astounding on the lack of proof an/or evidence towards my offense. I know for a fact I did not use 3rd party programs with Runescape(does SS(swift switch) count?). I didn’t begin my cheating days until perm-ban hit me. Looking over what they’ve told me and why I was banned, I’ve come to a solution;</p>
<p>Costumer Support is a bunch of monkeys beating on a keyboard all day.</p>
<p>Why do I say this? I was banned for <a href="https://offenceappeal.runescape.com/id/-7721246669673896687/rule.ws?id=7" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Rule 7</a>, in which I did not. By reading what they have told me for the offensive after my Query, I received this message:</p>
<blockquote>Thank you for your appeal.
<p>We are sorry to inform you that this appeal has been denied.</p>
<p>We have conclusive evidence that you committed the offence and for this reason this offence will remain on your account.</p>
<p>We suggest you take some time to remind yourself of the Rules of RuneScape before you start playing again!</p>
<p>RuneScape Customer Support</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay. So after reading that I thought, “What evidence?” - So out of curiosity I checked the evidence to see why I was banned, guess what I found?</p>
<blockquote>Sorry, no evidence is available for this offence.</blockquote> 
NOT ONLY THAT THEY SPELLED OFFENSE WRONG.
<p>But the point in this post is that Jagex bans wrongfully, I’ve found myself banned out of several accounts;<br>
Exe626<br>
Archr<br>
Mastr_Mage<br>
Also, locked from:<br>
Dwayne654321 (I missed this account a lot).<br>
Does costumer support actually look over the report or anything they ban you for? If I remember correctly on Exe626, I was walking from Al-kahard towards Varrock, D/C, ban. On Archr, I was in the wild pking like always(since 80+ ranged was high to pk in non-members at the time, I pretty much pwnd), D/C, ban, I’m still yet to figure out how I was macro-pking. On Mastr-Mage I was killing Lesser demons on Karamja(still in early stage, only about 60 mage, getting ready for membership), D/C, ban.<br>
On Dwayne654321, I was in Seers Village, cutting mages like I always did, D/C while in the middle of a trade on the RS forums! Locked, unable to unlock. I fear they ban you once you get to a certain point in the game just for the hell of it.</p>
