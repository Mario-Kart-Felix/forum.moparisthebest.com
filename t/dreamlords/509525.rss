    <description>[b]Dreamlords.[/b]
[b]This game was intentionally a mmorts and was the best strategy game imo at the time. Too bad picklock studios disclosed it due to the fact of low-income. The game was kinda sci-fi, and had three races. There was sol-gameplay as well as multiplayer gameplay, but the entire world was set-online. The game was mostly pvp oriented, but had PvM as well on the sideline. You could take over and control territories and gain rewards and every month every character reset to level 1, so it was kind of practical to play, but you got stronger for every era you played. Imo it was the best mmorts, so discuss you&#39;re thoughts about it [:[/b]</description>
