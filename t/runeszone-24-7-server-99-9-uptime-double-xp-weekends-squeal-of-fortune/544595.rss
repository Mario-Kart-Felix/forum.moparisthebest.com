    Why should you choose to play runeszone server?

    A very good question.. But a very simple answer which is, RunesZone cares about it&#39;s players, it cares about it&#39;s economy, it cares about how the server is ran and what the players suggest and what they want. We do everything we possible can to ensure that the players of RunesZone enjoy playing the game and get the most friendly, fun and enjoyable game play they can!

    The server does frequent and daily updates almost every day, you can view all/most of the updates that happen on RunesZone on the update-log on the forums. RunesZone focuses on every players enjoyment, we have every aspect of game-play that we know players enjoy PvM, PvP, skilling, you name it we have it! We are not like other servers which are ignorant to there players and just ignores there opinions and even ignores there players when they talk to them.. I have played over 50 servers over the past 4 years and have watched very carefully how the best servers are ran and also how the bad servers are ran, I have learnt there mistakes and adapted to how the best servers are ran which is why RunesZone is the place for you.

Why should you choose to play runeszone server?

A very good question.. But a very simple answer which is, RunesZone cares about it's players, it cares about it's economy, it cares about how the server is ran and what the players suggest and what they want. We do everything we possible can to ensure that the players of RunesZone enjoy playing the game and get the most friendly, fun and enjoyable game play they can!

The server does frequent and daily updates almost every day, you can view all/most of the updates that happen on RunesZone on the update-log on the forums. RunesZone focuses on every players enjoyment, we have every aspect of game-play that we know players enjoy PvM, PvP, skilling, you name it we have it! We are not like other servers which are ignorant to there players and just ignores there opinions and even ignores there players when they talk to them.. I have played over 50 servers over the past 4 years and have watched very carefully how the best servers are ran and also how the bad servers are ran, I have learnt there mistakes and adapted to how the best servers are ran which is why RunesZone is the place for you.
