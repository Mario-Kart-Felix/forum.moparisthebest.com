    <title>Rate my website, that I, myself, have created</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rate-my-website-that-i-myself-have-created/249946</link>
    <description>This was for my class project. I want you guys to ignore the content and concentrate on the layout. How do you like it? How can I make it better? I noticed that when viewing the webpage on IE the border under the current tab is the same border color as the content box. Is there a way I can fix this? Do I need to use IE conditionals? and how do you like the navigation?

By the way, I know the logo sucks. Is there a way in Gimp to make the background transparent and have the image blur itself to the transparent background?

Thanks for the input. Hope to hear some constructive criticism. :)

<p>The pictures were rushed. I wish I looked for transparent gifs and made margins around the images but I finished the website on an all-nighter. So I suppose it could have been better. The real .com website that will be finished (eventually) will be heavily worked on.</p>
<p>and has anyone know the fix for the IE border problem I’m having? I tried googling but no luck. I hope somebody figures it out because I really hate registering for another website just to post… so annoying.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@FastBawls</span>, yeah that’s true, but where would you like to see those changes the most? I will definitely add that code to the page. I knew I needed to use it but I was so tired after my all-nighter, that I had to take a break.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/jme">@jme</a>, yeah I didn’t know how to show that page without making the header logo appear strangely. Any suggestions for that?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/onlyonerule">@OnlyOneRule</a>, We weren’t allowed to touch the code at the bottom of each page. That was the professor’s code to check if our pages validated and when we last edited it so she can check if we passed it in on time.</p>

              <p>This was for my class project. I want you guys to ignore the content and concentrate on the layout. How do you like it? How can I make it better? I noticed that when viewing the webpage on IE the border under the current tab is the same border color as the content box. Is there a way I can fix this? Do I need to use IE conditionals? and how do you like the navigation?</p>
<p>By the way, I know the logo sucks. Is there a way in Gimp to make the background transparent and have the image blur itself to the transparent background?</p>
<p>Thanks for the input. Hope to hear some constructive criticism. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
