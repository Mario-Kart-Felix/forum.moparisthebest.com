              <p>Sweet troll, bro. The only remote problem here is number three.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are SUPPOSE to be swinging your sword when you hit somebody… Unless you mean the animation is punch for all weapons.</li>
<li>Do they disappear immediately? If not, items that are dropped are SUPPOSE to disappear over time.</li>
<li>When people die, they will keep the 3 most important items on a lot of servers. And some servers, they will keep everything depending on the coder/source.</li>
<li>In order to pick an item up on any server in the world. You need to be within 1 unit of the item(By the time the animation is finished, the code will register you as on top of the item). And in order to interact with an npc to shop or dialog you need to be within two units(Unit 1 is the action zone, animation-to-code delay will register you around unit 2 just as the item pickup). Trading with other players should follow the same rules as above.</li>
</ol>
<p>No problems here. move along.</p>
