    <title>Bridge Building Competition - WITH PRIZES :D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bridge-building-competition-with-prizes-d/195567</link>
    <description>Hello,
Today I volunteered at Explorathon, and part of the workshop I was helping with was a bridge building contest. I thought it was interesting, so I decided to try it. On the school computer I built several amazing ones, and decided a MITB contest might be fun. Here are my rules:
[u][b]BRIDGE BUILDING CONTEST[/b][/u]
[b]Software:[/b]
West Point Bridge Builder 2007 [http://bridgecontest.usma.edu/download.htm]
[b]Rules:[/b]
All default settings in the program, or to be more specific:
24 Metres
Standard abutments
no pier
No anchorage
Med Strength Concrete
Standard Loading
[b]Winners include:[/b]
Cheapest to work - judged by me
Funniest death bridge - Judged by peers
Coolest design - Judged by peers
Least members - Judged by me
Safest - Judged by me/peers
Most unique - Judged by peers
And more awards can be added if wanted.
[b]WHY?[/b]
[u][b]REWARDS OF COURSE![/b][/u]
Yes, I will give rewards to the winners.

Have fun! Deadline is... end of the month, you can submit as many entries as you would like.
