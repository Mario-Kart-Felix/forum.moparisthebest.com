    <description>Well i wasent sure where to post this; so i&#39;ll post it here:

I was wondering if anyone knew of a server that is like the rs2 classic.

Like pking in the right spots above edgy and vorrok; and npc training; stores in right place.

Dono if anyone has made a source like that; if not maybe i should make a source like that.

Plz Post!</description>

              <p>Try downloading a blank source, so you can add the npc’s yourself. I would download PimpScape it’s a great starter source.</p>
