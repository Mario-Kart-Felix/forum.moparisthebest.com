              <p>lol… its obvious rscd v.25 is better, since it was in development for a longer time.<br>
both are built from rscd base, so i wouldnt say demonik is worse becous of dupes, bugs etc? it wasnt finished when it was released.<br>
and tbh, its not very hard to fix demonik up and make it stable, make it work with forum, since it is already made for that.<br>
-but about no1 on this forum can actually code, and those who can dosent come here anymore, or has given up on developing rsc.<br>
(it dosent matter how good you make your server, how much better than others it is, fact is,<br>
no1 will bother to join you server, becous they already play 1000 diffrent shity servers…<span class="bbcode-b">rsc development is dead, face it</span>)<br>
rsc has joined a new rs2 era, download a source, change the name, voila!<br>
(<span class="bbcode-i">yes i know i released divinepk as that, i was imature and got requested, thats why</span>)<br>
now, when i actually know how to code i have also given up.</p>
<p>this is a stupid thread and you shouldnt post this stupid shit on here.</p>
