              <p>erm, owner and co owner can exist… actualy owner does exist in most sources already.</p>
<p>codes in your client are set to something like</p>
<p>if playerRights &gt;=3 yada yada</p>
<p>they are already in most sources for codes such as ip banning and ownerglow and stuff.</p>
<p>if u want to make co owners, just make codes with something like</p>
<p>if playerRights == 4 or something… whatever you want Co-owner rights number to be. just be sure that whoever you make co owner to put their player rights to that number in their character file to match the code in the client…</p>
<p>-----also, very important and nice to know while coding player rights required commands…<br>
did u notice the &gt;=, &lt;=, and == in your codes?</p>
<p>&lt;= means the requirements are less than or eaqual to the number you put after it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>= means greater than or equal to the number</p>
</blockquote>
<p>== means it has to be that number of rights.</p>
