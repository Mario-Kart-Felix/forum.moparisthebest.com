              <p>tha[quote=“jamessemple, post:2, topic:305465”]ok so it says 127.0.0.1 meaning your no-ip config is screwed so open up your no-ip folder and next to the red “no” sign there should be a .txt file that says DUC-(your username) and open that up and it will have your remote no-ip loggings from your ip.</p>
<p>If there are no recordings of updated ips then open up the no-ip DUC application and hit update and enter your ip thing you want. Make sure it has a smiley face next to it.</p>
<p>Hope this helped<br>
