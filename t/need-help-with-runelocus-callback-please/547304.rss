    <title>Need Help with Runelocus Callback please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-runelocus-callback-please/547304</link>
    <description>This is my Callback link in the admincp for Runelocus. The google is not a troll, that&#39;s the name of a forum that this forum won&#39;t allow to censor, just for those who were wondering.

[code]http://www.google.com/top-rsps-list/vote-39986-AnnihilatedPkerz%20-%20Pking%20Server/?i=[/code]

I tried this link what sk8rdude gave me, but this link just keeps telling me I&#39;ve voted already, even though it&#39;s passed over 24hours. (not blaming on you btw sk8rdude, you&#39;ve done great help with me. Dw)
[code]http://www.google.com/toplist/vote-39986-AnnihilatedPkerz%20-%20Pking%20Server/?i=[/code]

And this is the Runelocus Callback URL.

[code]http://www.annihilatedpkerz.com/vote/php/callback.php[/code]

Yet it keeps saying, please vote on all Links. Wuuht?</description>

<a href="http://www.google.com/top-rsps-list/vote-39986-AnnihilatedPkerz%20-%20Pking%20Server/?i=" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.google.com/top-rsps-list/vote-39986-AnnihilatedPkerz%20-%20Pking%20Server/?i=</a><br>
This was because GTL vote uses your IP to track votes, and rLocus changed their entire vote system. So I took the get tag from the runetoplist one, which uses ?i=Your_ip_here. I don’t know specifically how Locus’s callback system works. I’m sure you could look on their site, and check.<br>
The get may not be needed, it may still be needed.<br>
But, as I stated before, Moparscape does not have a callback system. If you add it to your vote page (which I know you have it on there currently), it will more than likely say “please vote on all links”.</p>
<p>Note: I just went on your page, didn’t even vote, hit continue, and it worked. Twice.[/quote]</p>
<p>ok thnkx, and I need help with this now.</p>
<p>Hey guys, So i downloaded smf theme inferno for my forum. I tried to check and see if the password recovery emails work. It says it has sent the email to reset your password. But its been 2 days and still nothing. I had 7 of my other players trying it yesterday and they havent gotten the email link neither. What’s up with this?<br>
Help please. Thnkx.</p>
