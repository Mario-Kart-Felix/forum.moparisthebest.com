    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/4-things-involving-castle-wars/297124</link>
    <description>Ok i need help with 4 things involving castle wars...this is the tut i followed http://silabsoft.org/smf/index.php?showtopic=5331&amp;st=0

Now it works yes, but first thing..the if killed apply dead part here it is
[code] if ((absX &gt;= 2359 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 2432 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3069 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 3134 &amp;&amp; IsDead == true &amp;&amp; NewHP &lt;= 1)) {
            if(Sara == true) {
        IsDead = false;
        playerLevel[3] = getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]);
        currentHealth = playerLevel[3];
        NewHP = playerLevel[3];
            refreshSkills();
        updateRequired = true;
        appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
            teleportToX = 2427;
            teleportToY = 3074;
            sendMessage(&quot;you died in castlewars&quot;);
        }
        else if(Zammy == true) {
        IsDead = false;
        playerLevel[3] = getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]);
        currentHealth = playerLevel[3];
        NewHP = playerLevel[3];
            refreshSkills();
        updateRequired = true;
        appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
            teleportToX = 2372;
            teleportToY = 3131;
            sendMessage(&quot;you died in castlewars&quot;);
            
        }
        }[/code]
They wouldn&#39;t tele to their castles unless i changed the isDead=false; on both of them to isDead=true;
now they cant move if they die in castlewars. So if anyone could help me on that..it would be great--FIXED

Secondly i would like to..if its even possible make it so the players on the other team  drop tokkul when they die. If you are not able to plz show me how to make it so if you kill someone it gives you points..so basically make a point system and show we what the link is if its a tutorial

Thirdly if anyone can refer me to a tutorial about how to make a tokkul shop plz! tell me..if you showed me how to make a point system plz tell me how to make a shop that uses only those points.

And the fourth one..how do i make it so you cannot attack someone in the same team..</description>
