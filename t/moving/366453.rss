    <description>hey, in my server i am trying to move my runecrafting altars but cant find out where they are in my source. i checked the global objects and rest of the clients but the coords were nowhere in there. when i searched the whole source it only came up with 1 of the coords in client, item and commands. where do i find the coords to move altars?</description>
