    <title>How to change the message&#39;s of NPC&#39;s and What NPC they are</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-change-the-messages-of-npcs-and-what-npc-they-are/133338</link>
    <description>Well first find an NPC saying something, Next go to Player.Java on your source doc
Push Ctrl+F, Type in the message that the NPC had said and you can edit it there along with other NPC messages. also it will have their ID you can change that if you have an ID you want to use.

Hope this helped some.</description>

              <p>OMG THIS IS A FIRST. People usually post questions in the tutorial section, Now someone posted a tutorial in the qustion section! lol, no offense dude, im not flaming you. Its just that so many people post questions in the tutorial section, so this is funny. But ya. its in the wrong section.<br>
And also, to make an npc say something, you search for “moo” in npchandler.java. It also has the npc id there also…</p>
