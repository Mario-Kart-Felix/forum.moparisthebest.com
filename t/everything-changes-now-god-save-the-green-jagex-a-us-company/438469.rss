    <title>Everything changes now...god save the green (Jagex a US company)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/everything-changes-now-god-save-the-green-jagex-a-us-company/438469</link>
    <description>I wanted to post this yesterday, but the site was being a bitch. Anyway...

http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/01/09/god-save-the-green-deal-makes-jagex-a-us-company/

This is the best explanation as of yet for the SOF and other promotions. To make some connections for those who are tl;dr, Andrew sold his remaining shares to a large Jagex investor, giving them the majority of ownership in the company. Jagex&#39;s profits last year were very low, and they lost almost half of their member base in the 4th quarter from removing bots. It doesn&#39;t take much logic to figure out that they are in some serious financial trouble this year. Their investors are looking to make some money on the company, not watch it go bankrupt. So at this point, SOF and raised membership costs are all that&#39;s keeping RuneScape from being lost to bankruptcy. This is not far exaggerated.

It seems Andrew may have finally given up on the game that made him famous over a decade ago.</description>
