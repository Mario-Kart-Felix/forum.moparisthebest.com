    <title>LF better Attack() system</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lf-better-attack-system/529385</link>
    <description>Almost all of my questions are complicated and no one is able to assist me, So i&#39;m just looking for the idea, not the coding.

Unfortunately I don&#39;t really code PI so I don&#39;t have a source don&#39;t have the ability to look at one or anything like that.
maybe how does Hyperion do it?

If someone wants to provide a link to a source that works, however I&#39;d prefer not to see how they do it because then I&#39;ll grab their bad habits.

Delta&#39;s combat system is the worse, I&#39;ve got it almost all combined to one system and entirely redone; players and npcs, melee, ranged, and magic, one system.
bad naming conventions, specials are terrible, double damage... gah.. they call arrow checking like 10 times through the entire attack() subroutine.
They do a loop checking every staff that can auto cast, before checking if you are even attempting to auto cast...

I&#39;m just looking for a better way. I&#39;m already recoding the system might as well do it correctly.
which will make life so much easier. However I noticed their combat system is based on the system timer that everything uses. 

Does PI use a better system? I am basically Looking for input where/how would you guys recommend I setup an attack system.

I really don&#39;t like setting it up on the every 500ms timer. It&#39;s just... just terrible to be honest.

I&#39;ve gotten completely redone the special atks, rather then doing an attack, it just increases max damage.

however I&#39;m missing How/where to do the combat. Right now if you attack someone, it checks every 500ms if it should attack again.
The Timer is just a bad idea.. I&#39;m hoping PI does it a different way and someone experienced can provide me the &quot;idea&quot; so I can code it that way.

Edit: C&#39;mon guys I know there are a lot of smart people here.
Edit2: I may just have too download the Hyperion or something and figure out how they do it.
Edit3: No suggestions at all?</description>
