    <title>CountDown timers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/countdown-timers/380007</link>
    <description>Okay, so im currently hosting a server and a few of my players have been asking if there is any way to add a feature that counts down from 60 minutes so they know when to log off so they dont get a rollback when the server restarts. 

So I agreed with them and told them id look into it. But the thing is, I have know Idead of how I would do this.

SO if anyone could help me with this I would really appreciate it. Oh and im running a [PI] server.</description>
