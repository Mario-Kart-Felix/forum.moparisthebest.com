    <title>Need help finding a specific tool in photoshop cs3</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-finding-a-specific-tool-in-photoshop-cs3/289729</link>
    <description>Hey, im new to the forums and also photoshop, just got cs3 last night and ive been messing around on it alot, but im trying to find a specific tool that i was reading about. Its a line that you can warp around, kinda like the flexible line used in paint, i read somewhere that you can find in in the &quot;pen&quot; tool, but all i can do is choose a start point then a end point and it makes a line between both points. But i cant flex this line. maybe im actually in the totally wrong tools but what im trying to do is make the line, then make it 3px wide or whatever, then give it an outer glow so it looks cool lol...but yeah any help is appreciated and if you need any more info ill will reply soon, thanks.</description>

              <p>OK, simple one. There’s actually a couple tutorials here on using the Pen Tool. But in a nutshell you click the brush tool, edit the settings of the brush, i.e. 3px diameter 75% Hardness. Then use the Pen tool to make the form you want, after that, right click along the highlighted form, and click “Stroke Path” in the scroll down box, choose Brush Stroke. Click the check box if you want to simulate pressure, which you probably do. Play around with it to get your preferred settings.</p>
<p>If you want a blur on the form, then the easiest way is to right click the layer and apply a layer glow, of the same color. Or you can just duplicate the layer, then apply a blur to the lower layer.</p>

              <p>The pen tool is pretty good. Press Ctrl to curve it. The rectangular marquee tool is also fairly good. Eye dropper tool is best for adjustment layers and text.</p>
