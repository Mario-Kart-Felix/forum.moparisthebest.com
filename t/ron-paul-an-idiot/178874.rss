    <title>Ron paul an idiot?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ron-paul-an-idiot/178874</link>
    <description>He&#39;s not for a strong military.
He has consistently voted against funding the troops in the field. He wants to return to the good old days of the toothless military of the 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s.
He wants to &quot;farm out&quot; military action through letters of marque AKA state sponsored piracy. Can you imagine the &quot;blowback&quot; from that policy?

And Skip, yes your hero Ron Paul did say that 9/11 was our fault by saying that it was caused by our policies for the past 50 years.

Ron Paul is a conspiracy nut who wants to team up with Dennis Kucinich to have ANOTHER investigation into 9/11. He&#39;s supported by people who are nuttier than a fruit cake such as Alex Jones and Michael Rivero...Both of which say that 9/11 was an inside job.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I don’t think Ron Paul is an idiot. In one political debate Ron Paul said “I think we need to stop going into other people’s business around the world and concentrate on improving our country” (or something very similar to that). Rudy Guiliani gets up and says “How dare you say that! Apologize right now! I demand an apology!” which I thought was really bizarre because if we didn’t fuck around in other countries such as Pakistan/Afaganistan, we wouldn’t have all these Madrasses that teach muslim children to hate and despise America. The Madrasses are also the root of the terrorist evils that made Osama Bin Laden.</p>
<p>When Ron Paul says that 9/11 was our fault, I think he’s right. During the cold war when we were against Russia, we created the sort of “hate schools” which bred terrorists to attack Russia, but when the cold war was over, we left these schools undestroyed and came back to the states for a state of bliss for a number of years. Osama Bin Laden used to be on our side until he turned but we were the ones that created him and many more who ended up following Bin Laden.</p>
<p>Here are some facts. I don’t know how you feel about globalresearch.ca but it seems to be unbiased.<br>
“The following text outlines the history of Osama Bin Laden and the links of the Islamic “Jihad” to the formulation of US foreign policy during the Cold War and its aftermath.” - <a href="http://globalresearch.ca/articles/CHO109C.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://globalresearch.ca/articles/CHO109C.html</a></p>

              <p>Paul proposed cutting out the Department of Homeland Security and read Al Qaida’s stated grievances with the United States, except he forgot to mention the two tirades by Osama bin Laden on global warming, perhaps because doing anything about global warming doesn’t fit in with his own issues. But why not? If Paul believes the United States is the cause for radical Islam, even though it predates the very founding of the U.S., wouldn’t he want to alter or change whatever ‘reason’ Al Qaida gives to attack this nation?</p>

              <p>[quote=“xxlegitxx, post:10, topic:178874”]I am pissed off enough to post about this.</p>
<p>Ron Paul is the best candidate who was smeared by the media.  End of story.  All his stances are backed by reason and the Constitution.</p>
<p>Why legalize pot?  To save millions of dollars spent on food and housing for people put in jail for non-violent drug possession charges.  We could be solving world hunger with that kind of money.</p>
<p>Why vote against the war?  To save trillions of dollars spend on an unconstitutional, misguided war.  You realize that Bush and Cheney have lied about WMD’s despite CIA intelligence reports, condoned torture of POW’s and others, and caused the stringent airport security measures which could not stop a rocket launcher from getting onto the plane.  It’s all style, no substance.  This war is not providing peace.  It’s causing a mess.  Forget everything the media force-fed you.  Because it’s bullshit, not peanut butter, dimwit.  We could send a manned mission to the moon every 15 days with that kind of money.</p>
<p>Why look into 9-11?  Because numerous reports say that Rice/Bush/Cheney had evidence of a planned attack, but did nothing about it.  They did not launch the attacks, but they seriously helped it along.  But no solid evidence, you’re right.  Because it was all burned in the mysterious fire in Cheney’s office.  That’s right.</p>
<p>Why follow the Constitution?  Because the Constitution protects the rights of the people and limits the powers of the government.  As of now, Bush is expanding the powers of the executive branch while limiting the rights of people.  (See Patriot Act, NSA, etc.)</p>
<p>Why not be limited a bit (or a lot) for our security, it’s for our own good, right?  Let’s see… who said “Give me liberty or give me death?”  Some heathen Iraqi, right?  Some retard French guy?  Some snobby Brit?  No?  Surely not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Henry" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Patrick Henry</a>?  The very foundation of our country is based on freedom, and you’re willing to give it up to pad Bush’s pocket?  I mean, to ensure our freedom?  Not.</p>
<p>Let’s see, a recap of his presidency:</p>
<ol>
<li>Brought us into an undeclared, unprovoked war with a innocent country.</li>
<li>Brought us from a surplus to extreme debt.</li>
<li>Landed us in a potential economic depression.</li>
<li>Caused death and torture of numerous innocent victims.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/rchart4.gif%5B/quote%5D" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/rchart4.gif[/quote]</a></p>
<p>And thats why he should be the next president, but definately won’t. News stations always pick favorites, and then they follow each other. Now its going to be obama/hillary against mccaine. pfft, mccaine.</p>

<p>EDIT Slightly on-topic</p>
<p>[quote=“dbzmaster555, post:1, topic:178874”]He’s not for a strong military.<br>
He has consistently voted against funding the troops in the field. He wants to return to the good old days of the toothless military of the 20’s and 30’s.[/quote]</p>
<p>can you elaborate what you mean by “toothless military” ?</p>
<p>Ive done a little reading and all I’ve come across is what seems more like a consolidation of our military and being more practical about where we ship our troop’s out to. I could be entirely wrong though.</p>

<p>This is offtopic, but: I am also neutral, however the burden of proof is not on dbz. It’s like me saying to you, prove that my dick is not 14 inches.</p>
<p>As for ron paul, I watched some clips from him on youtube and thought he looked like a good candidate. I am not American, so I know nothing about this though.</p>

<p>Ron Paul is a conspiracy nut who wants to team up with Dennis Kucinich to have ANOTHER investigation into 9/11. He’s supported by people who are nuttier than a fruit cake such as Alex Jones and Michael Rivero…Both of which say that 9/11 was an inside job.</p>
