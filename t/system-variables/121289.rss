    <title>System Variables</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/system-variables/121289</link>
    <description>I know this has been posted many times on the forum but the topic got pruned.
I am having alot of problems with my Java and I haven&#39;t been able to fix it I get errors when I use a client and I also get errors when I compile a server. I download the SE software but for some reason I could never get it to compile and this is becoming a real problem for me. 

I need someone to guide me to the right place. I need someone to spend 5 mins to give me the DIRECT download link the the latest version. And what I need to change in the system variables to get evreything to work correctley.

If anyone can give me the right directions I would be very thankful![br][size=1]Posted on: 09 July 2007, 03:32:08[/size][hr]Nevermind I got help elsewhere. Mod lock please.</description>
