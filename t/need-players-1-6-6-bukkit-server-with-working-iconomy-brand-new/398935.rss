    <description>[size=24]Welcome everyone to Limited-X![/size]  
 
This server has 90% no lag and runs without Hamachi! 
It is a 1.6.6 Minecraft Bukkit server. Its brand new and unfinished. If you join and help build the upcoming town it&#39;s very likely of you becoming a Moderator.  
 
[align=center]Heres the IP so you don&#39;t miss it. [/align]
 
[align=center][size=36]96.244.178.211[/size][/align] 
 
The point of this server is basically real life, without jobs. 
 
You own your own shop, that you will make. 
 
[align=center]~~~~~~~~The ranks~~~~~~~~[/align] 
[align=center]Immigrant (Start out) 
Citizen (Build a sign for a starting house in spawn) 
Journeyman (Build your own house in the development) 
Mayor (Build a town) 
Governor (Control an entire city of towns) 
Vice President - ur_mom_in_HD (good friend) 
President - made4speed2 (me)[/align]
