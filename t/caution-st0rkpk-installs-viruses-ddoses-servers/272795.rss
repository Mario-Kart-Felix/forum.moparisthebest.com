    <title>Caution - st0rkpk installs viruses + ddoses servers</title>

    <description>This is a warning to anyone who is thinking about playing st0rkpk DO NOT.

It is well known that their admins attack other servers, they have previously installed viruses onto the computers of people who use their client (so they can use them to ddos servers) and it is likely they will do so again.

st0rkpk has been banned from advertising on mopar for these reasons and we advise that people do not play their server.

There are other, better PK servers, so just look for a different one.</description>
