<p>The RSC moderators were already doing their job fine in their own section. Why should they take up spaces for other members of this forum that would actually moderate other sections?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Due to limitations of SMF, sectionals can’t have warning powers or ban powers, etc. And since not many of our staff visit the rsc sections, it was necessary to promote them so that they could do a better job. They have all proved themselves worthy and therefore we know that if they <span class="bbcode-i">choose</span> to moderate other sections of the site, we trust them to make good decisions at their own discretion. There is NO limit to how many mods we can have, so they are NOT taking up space.</p>
<p>We would all love to see more active intelligent moderators. And we are always looking hard for them! Do you see the problem yet? We can’t find anyone to meet that description!</p>
<p>As I post this now, there are no reported posts for me to check. There usually isn’t. Sometimes though, you might have to wait. Just report it and move on. Surely someone flaming or spamming can’t stress you out so badly that you need it corrected instantly.</p>
<p>Honestly, the current staff members are the <span class="bbcode-b">least</span> of your problems here. We could all have much nicer stuff if there was more learning, more programming, more developing. The community is what you make it. Are we a hard working community with innovative ideas and development that stands above the rest? Is this a kiddy zone rsps site?  Or is this website just going to be another teen hang-out chat spot? It’s whatever you make it to be. And quite frankly most of you (including me) are making it shit.</p>
<p>I do spend a lot of time here. I wish I could spend more of it helping you guys with the tutorial section, etc. But that doesn’t mean I am taking up spots from someone else who COULD spend time doing that. I am still trusted by the higher staff to do my job properly, when I choose to do it.</p>

        <p>Our moderation team is fine, we just need a few sectional mods that can keep their area clean and help out when we need them the most, they could even keep a list of warnings they have given people and then the moderators can take care of the banning, muting, etc, the things sectionals can’t.</p>

        <p>The Moderation seems to be fair enough at the moment for me. Though that is while I have just recently joined not even 7 days ago all together.</p>
<p>The Moderators are only human beings and some people on the site need to remember that. However, I do agree that some of the Moderators on the forums aren’t quite as active. As for the recently promoted Moderators; I do think they could do a better job on Moderating <a href="http://moparscape.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a>. We can’t do much as to inspire them to be become active again; however we can be patient and hope they can do their duty and become active again.</p>
<p>The reports that I report are dealt with within a matter of at least two hours at the most so far as I’ve seen. Therefore I do not have any complaints about them so far at least and I hope in the future I don’t ever have to complain about them. Some people also need to recognize a lot of things aren’t going to be taken care of at least not looked at simply because they do not report the situation.</p>

        <p>Just to clarify, Peeter and K09 were made MoparScape moderators just for the RSC section.  The way SMF is written I can’t give sectional moderators any type of warn/mute/ban powers, and they need them in that section.  So they aren’t necessarily expected to moderate any other section but the RSC ones.</p>

        <p>You seem to be rambling on and on and on, to the point of tl;dr.<br>
Let me make a quick edit to simplify your original post and bring forth the actual purpose/meaning in one sentence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can I please, please please be moderator? I would do a great job!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There we go, all fixed.</p>
<p>It’s obvious (to me, at least) that you are making this post to show that you know what makes a person a bad moderator; at the same time, you are (in a nonchalant way) showing the administrators that you know what it takes to be a moderator and therefore you might do a good job at it. I see this as the real reason behind you making a topic like this. The staff doesn’t affect the users enough to drive a reasonable person to make a topic such as this. The only conclusive reason for you to make a topic like this is the attempt to show administrators that you would make a good moderator.</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, anyone who has the <span class="bbcode-i">desire</span> to be a moderator (and to me, you have clearly shown a desire for such with this topic) would not fit the position because any desire to be a moderator shows that there is personal intent behind it - which will most likely lead to corruption and/or a failure to fulfill the actual responsibilities that moderators should take upon themselves. Basically, anyone who <span class="bbcode-i">wants</span> to be a moderator should not be a moderator.</p>
<p>I hate to call people out and most of the time I’m chill about things, but it seems to me like you almost had the staff fooled.<br>
Welp, that’s all I have to say.</p>

        <p>Although i fully respect everyone’s claims, standard members can’t really made a fair judgement because they cannot see every single moderating action that all the moderators do. You may see a moderator post but you do not do not know who’s being deleting topics, banning members, handing out punishments, or actually looking at reports. Some moderators, including myself, will deal with a topic without posting it. We may delete the topic and pm the op.</p>
<p>The point is that being a moderator isn’t about spending hours on end patrolling the site and punishing every single user that steps out of line just one bit. I see my position as additional thing I do during my spare time; I enforce the rules and try be a role model - not a slave. Thinking that the position gives you some sort of god status (which I can clearly see that some members believe) is just silly.</p>
<p>One of the golden rules of finding a suitable moderator is finding someone who doesn’t have a strong determination to be a moderator and the staff remember all the members that clearly do.</p>
<p>A major fault within this website is the inconsistency between the public rules, the moderator guidelines and the ideal “rules”. The staff are working very hard to correct this which will result in everything being more fair.</p>

<p>A major fault within this website is the inconsistency between the public rules, the moderator guidelines and the ideal “rules”. The staff are working very hard to correct this which will result in everything being more fair.[/quote]I agree with you on many accounts, but some points are invalid.</p>
<p>It is fairly obvious to us normal members when a staff member is active. An active staff member may do all of that ‘behind the scenes’ work, but you cannot say a staff member is active just because behind the scenes work happens. The chance that a staff member is not posting, and is only doing behind the scenes work, seems fairly ridiculous.</p>
<p>What do you conclude as ‘god status’ meaning? Technically, in this forum, you have all power over us. You can ‘kill’ us, mute us, and higher level staff members can change us in any way that pleases them. I find that to be rather god-like. To be honest, if the staff were not supposed to be set above the rest, you would not have a cute little bulbasaur next to your name announcing you were a staff member. Perhaps a topic containing the list of staff members (like the one given in the op) would be there, so that someone might understand how random user ‘SilentCJ’ or ‘Niall’ managed to lock his post. However, you are putting that cute little bulbasaur into the <span class="bbcode-b">awards</span> section of your profile.</p>
<p>And your golden rule makes no sense. I’ve never heard of any government that elects people that do not run for election. Have you? I am not saying you should have a ballot box where users can submit their name and you all vote, but searching for people that aren’t as dedicated to the site seems to me, to be rather counter productive.</p>
<p>I hope that no one misinterprets these points, they are just my opinions.</p>
