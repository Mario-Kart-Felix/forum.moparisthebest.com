    <description>EDIT: I THINK THIS IS THE WRONG PLACE

I need help with firstly downloading and starting moparscape...so i look at the main post where &quot;moparisthebest&quot; posted the link to download moparscape 3.2 ( or was it just 3? ) and i clicked this, it gave me 2 download options (http://uppit.com/NCD3S and http://www.ihud.com/file.php?file=files/180307/1174257375/MoparScapeInstall.exe ) Firsty, i &quot;IHud&quot; one doesnt work...it doesnt have any link to moparscape, and the download from &quot; Uppit&quot; downloads sucsesfully, and then when it has been sucsesfully downloaded and installed, i double click it on my desktop and it appears the way its ment to be ( i have saw my freind using it )...but that only lasts for a second or two, then it closes. I have downloaded it 3 or 4 times now and i am just fraustrated now.

Does anyone have a sollution to my problem?</description>
