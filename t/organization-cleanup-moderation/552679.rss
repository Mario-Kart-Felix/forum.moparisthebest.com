    <description>[b]Moderators[/b]
I would like for us to vote on moderators for the RSC boards. A valuable individual to this community has always been Nacional. He&#39;s always fair game, never picks sides and is a great neutral party, he is even down to host dragon parties from time to time. He&#39;s been a great friend throughout the years and you can review his posts if you want to see what I am talking about. If not him, there are a few others around here who might be worthy, what do you guys think? Feel free to nominate!

[b]RSC Server Development / Discussion Board[/b]
There are a lot of unnecessary posts on the RSC Server Development / Discussion board. I would like to bring it to everyones attention and maybe we could come up with a solution.

I think we should remove all forum TOPICS that :
1. Do not include any sort of code.

2. Do not provide a valuable conversation for people who want to look into the past. It&#39;s quite annoying looking at map editors throughout the years and seeing non stop bickering, it makes us look like shit too when people search for tools or references from the past.

3. Are not RSC related.

These are within the first two pages :

Furthermore, there are posts that can be merged. For example we could remove a lot of nonsense topics about content and they can be merged into a &quot;Show Off&quot; topic. If its a topic relating to a form of release, we can move it to a &quot;Release&quot; topic or maybe we could just create a new childboard &quot;Releases&quot; and have a general release topic there for misc.

https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,671223.0.html


Finally, there are stupid questions being asked in this board which should always be moved to the Server/Client/Spam help section.

[b]MoparClassic Board[/b]
The MoparClassic board nobody cares about, it&#39;s suppose to be for a server but you know how that went. #OpenSourcePublicServerNoSubs/DonationsFairPlayServer. Maybe we could remove it completely or hide it from the public.


[b]Server / Client Help[/b]
I think what we need to do as a community is update Yongs tutorials and make them even more basic for people. Maybe have a child board in the help section for &quot;Tuts&quot; ? Every once in a while we get new people but they are shut down so easily and I feel that we need to make it easier for them to learn and host a server of there own (EasyRSC was great, Noobscape) but it only starts there and there really isnt much for them to build off of except trolls.


Continuously working on RSC in private, I think about how I can make RSC accessible for others. I don&#39;t want to hear anything about how it&#39;s dead, we can still centralize the population and interest without hosting a server. I believe, if we do that.. we could potentially build something that could take us back to the 500+ days. This isn&#39;t about RSCE, RSCR, Karamja, MoparClassic, ClassicKBD, SlayPK, whatever. They had their chances, I think we need to do something without a server and changing these boards around will be a great start.

What do you guys think?</description>

              <p>Yeah, exactly like that, vortex. If anyone has some unlikely but decision shifting arguments to type please do so within the next day or so otherwise I’ll go ahead and archive the MoparClassic board. As far as having a moderator who’s dedicated to this section, I think it’s a pretty arbitrary decision so I’ll see where you guys take it. What member(s) are under consideration by the people who use this section?</p>

<p>It just seems like people get away with so much more than on other sections as i literally browse everything and see punishments from being warned to muted or banned.</p>
<p>Ephermeral Vrunk Stork Xent K09 Peeter Bigh51 they were all mods here.</p>
<p>Im just asking for a global moderator to come by once and a while and cleanup rodger is asking for a specific mod i dunno if this small of a section needs one at the moment.</p>

<p>The issue is that they haven’t been moved, deleted or taken care of. My initial posts expressed how the Server/Client Help section is also like a rsc spam section.</p>

There wouldn't be any additions, we have had them in the past, they are no longer around/relevant. Take the spot from them and we will still have the same amount or less. Regardless, the addition of 1 person who is active here would go a long way!

              <p>There are rules, but how they’re interpreted defines how harsh of a policy it is. For example, what constitutes as spam is interpreted in varying ways even across the staff team, some ways more lenient than others. You’re asking for a harsher interpretation of how those rules have been enforced in the past, which would bring this section out of sync with the rest of the community. If any staff are viewing this please weigh in with your opinions, especially about the addition of a moderator for this section. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>We don’t need a global moderators that really don’t care about RSC. A RSC moderator for the RSC section only will allow for that person(s) to moderate properly, we as a small community need someone who we can all relate to, there are a few candidates if we get around to a voting process. The RSC boards have always been treated different and that’s how it should be. The RSC mods we have had in the past aren’t around, so lets elect new ones.</p>
<p>These boards contain a lot of shit and are disorganized, we can easily change the attitude around here which would result in higher quality posts. That’s the idea.</p>
<p>Patiently waits for other people to pitch their two cents.</p>

              <p>It’s one thing having a harsher moderation policy for the future, but it’s another having someone selectively go around pruning potentially a lot of topics. You’re essentially asking for the way rules are enforced to be very rapidly shifted towards the harsher end of the spectrum, which is possible, but why does it require a new moderator? Given the criteria you’ve specified our global moderator team should have no issue determining what posts stay. As far as MoparClassic, I have no issue hiding the board, if that’s what you lot want then I’ll make it hidden.</p>
