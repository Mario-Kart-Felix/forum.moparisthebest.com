              <p>Is this the online client or a downloaded one?</p>
<p>If it is downloaded try using the online one because it seems as though the downloadable ones dont have every silab item to begin with.</p>
<p>Just go to:  <a href="http://client.silabsoft.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://client.silabsoft.org/</a> and it will work everytime.   ;D</p>
<p>Other than that… I have no expertise with homemade clients. Seems as though most ppl who code them don’t do it properly.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
