    <title>How do you dispose of objects in game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-dispose-of-objects-in-game/279801</link>
    <description>Ok, my question is this.  Say, on a 317 there is an object on the game that I want to get rid of, and I don&#39;t know how, so if someone could tell me how to get rid of an in game object.  :)

Thx.</description>

              <p>Use the delete object void in your client. I think it is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">deleteObject(X, Y, ObjId);</code></pre>
<p>Not really sure though because I really never need to delete objects <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
