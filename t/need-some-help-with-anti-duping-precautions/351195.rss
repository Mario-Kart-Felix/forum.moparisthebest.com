    <title>Need some help with anti duping precautions</title>

    <description>i heard you can dupe, get free pk points, and cash fast in pkplanet v2, now i need some help with this, i tried it and it worked

if you click dismantle twice really fast on a godsword, u get the godsword and the dismantled version, considering how rare a godsword is in my server, i need to find out how to get rid of dismantle, what code do i have to delete? is it in client.java or item/itemhandler.java?

also how can i make it so in the first 10 minutes an account is created, i can make it so they cant attack it, making boosting very difficult (or longer)</description>
