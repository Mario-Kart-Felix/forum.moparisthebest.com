    <description>[b]Hey, i&#39;m making this because I have been stuck on this stuff for ONE WHOLE DAY! Since I&#39;m new, I tried the tutorial Editing EasyRSC, So I did what he said, right up to when he said :Go into your server folder. Once in your server folder, go into:

Conf -- Server -- Defs

Once in the Defs folder, find and open your ItemsDef.xml file.
 :confused: :confused: :confused: When I opend the ItemsDef.xml, Safari opened and i couldn&#39;t edit a thing! (P.S I have tried EVERYTHING) So can anyone help me?
Anyway this topic is for new people like me. Please help us  [/b]i guess... [b][/b]</description>
