    <title>BXPW Removal</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bxpw-removal/449644</link>
    <description>Yesterday they made a thread saying that Bonus XP weekends are now removed and instead they will be giving members some other &quot;rewards&quot;. 

Don&#39;t you think its a coincidence? Nerf effigys, now these weekends. Probably thinking &quot;No more free xp, use the SOF and buy some&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hey 

Just a quick post to let you know that we are rethinking the idea of bonus XP weekends. We have run these for the last few years and whilst they are quite rewarding, there are some big negatives to the way they work. 

We certainly want to do XP promotions in the future, but what form they will take, we just don’t know yet. We wanted to let you know nice and early, so, to those of you buying stocks up trying to make a quick profit or preparing for future bonus XP weekends... don’t! 

Actually, we&#39;re organizing some other great member’s rewards for the latter part of the year, so keep reading the news to find out what we have planned. 

Mod Mark&lt;/blockquote&gt;
