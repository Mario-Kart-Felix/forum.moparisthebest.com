    <title>Artim 718 Player owned houses Pvp &amp; normal mode</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/artim-718-player-owned-houses-pvp-normal-mode/554061</link>
    <description>Once a player builds a lever in the Throne Room, the player can set the mode of the house by right-clicking on the lever. There are currently two mode states: Default and PvP.
Im working on Challenge mode.

Challenge mode allows the first player who can find and open the chest in the Treasure Room to gain the treasure. In this mode, the traps and guards in the Dungeon and Oubliette can damage players. Challenge mode is safe; when players die, they respawn outside of the house and lose no items. PvP Challenge mode is similar to Challenge mode, although players can now attack each other. If players die in either situation, they will respawn outside the house portal the house was in with all of their items.
