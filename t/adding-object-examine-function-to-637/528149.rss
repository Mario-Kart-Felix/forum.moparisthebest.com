    <title>Adding object examine function to 637</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-object-examine-function-to-637/528149</link>
    <description>Title says 90%. I want to make it so that when you examine an object it says the correct examine info. There is no method to get the examine info and display it. Currently the server displays nothing when an object is examined. Anyone help? I tried looking in my other server but i couldnt find anything even though the object examine works.</description>
