    <title>Four dead in Espoo, Finland Sello shopping mall shooting</title>

    <description>http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2009/12/31/2009-12-31_reports_four_dead_in_espoo_finland_sello_shopping_mall_shooting_gunman_may_still.html

&lt;blockquote&gt;A gunman killed four people early Thursday in a shooting rampage at a mall in Finland&#39;s second largest city, police told a state broadcaster.

It was not clear whether the shooter in Espoo had been apprehended and some reports indicated he was still on the loose. State broadcaster Yle reported that the gunman was born in 1966 and was previously known to police.

Police told Yle that three men and one woman were killed in the shopping center.

A witness told the broadcaster that a man dressed in black began randomly shooting at people on the second floor of the Sello mall.

Another witness who was in the mall at the time told Finnish radio that a panic ensued as the shooting began. &quot;There were loads of people who were crying, and many vendors who were completely panicked,&quot; the unnamed witness said.

&quot;It seems like they hadn&#39;t caught the one who shot,&quot; the witness said. &quot;No one seemed to know what had happened.&quot;

Police could not be reached for comment.

The Sello shopping mall describes itself as one of the Nordic region&#39;s largest with more than 170 shops. It opened in 2005.

Finland, a nation of 5.3 million, has 1.6 million firearms in private hands and ranks among the top five nations in the world in civilian gun ownership.

Politicians, social workers and religious leaders have urged tighter gun laws, more vigilance of Internet sites, and more social bonding in the small Nordic nation, known for its high suicide rates, heavy drinking and domestic violence.

In September 2008, a lone gunman killed nine fellow students and a teacher at a vocational college before shooting himself in the western town of Kauhajoki, and in November 2007, an 18-year-old student fatally shot eight people and himself at a high school in southern Finland.

Both young men fired guns in YouTube clips posted before the shootings, shot themselves in the head and used .22-caliber handguns bought from the same store

From what I heard, the shooter&#39;s wife had an affair with another man. The shooter went to Sello to look for his wife but didn&#39;t find her so he decided to shoot some people. Makes no sense, does it???????

Do come to Finland.</description>

You’re forgetting the scope of the law – outlaws live outside of it and, while subject to it, often get away with carrying weapons such as knives.<br>
For the record, in the incident I mentioned it was actually 8 people; you were close, but no cigar. I wouldn’t have been the least bit surprised if they had knives.</p>
<p>And you raise a point about them having weapons as well, and wanted to know what I would achieve. Maybe I wouldn’t survive. But trust me, I’d be satisfied just offing one or two of the mongrels before they offed me in such a scenario.</p>

Suggesting that someone shouldn’t drive a car because they could be in an accident is silly.<br>
No, nobody is going to stop driving one. But you better believe that anyone with a brain in their skull will drive carefully.<br>
Being careful isn’t the same as being paranoid.<br>
[/quote]and carrying a gun EVERYWHERE you go is not being paranoid?[/quote]</p>
<p>Not at all, why in the world would that be considered paranoid?  I don’t think anyone is out to get me, and I don’t live in constant fear of being attacked or anything.  I simply have a right to carry a gun, and I exercise that right.  I’m not alone either, many others do the same thing and I’m glad they do.  I don’t see the problem here?</p>

Suggesting that someone shouldn’t drive a car because they could be in an accident is silly.<br>
No, nobody is going to stop driving one. But you better believe that anyone with a brain in their skull will drive carefully.<br>

Nope. No more paranoid than wearing a seatbelt or looking both ways when crossing the road.</p>
