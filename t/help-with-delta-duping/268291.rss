    <title>Help with Delta Duping</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-delta-duping/268291</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been looking for about an hour (using the search and all that), and i still can&#39;t find an accurate tut about how to fix duping in Delta!  I found three tuts on how to fix it in the tut section, but they were in &quot;unverified tutorials&quot; section, and i couldn&#39;t access them.  All I am looking for is a decent answer to this simple question.  Thanks for helping.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 19, 2009, 02:18:11 pm[/size][hr]Anyone?  :confused:</description>
