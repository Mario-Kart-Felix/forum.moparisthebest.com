    <description>Help! Im trying to make an autominer and i have 20% knowledge on scar scripting. The only basic type of scripting i could do its action script and nothing more. But i need help here. Im trying to make script were It would find the color of the Copper ore. And if the color of the copper ore is found the script will proceed to click on that ore and mine it. And if the color of that ore turns dark brown (meaning that the ore is used up) it would locate on the screen a new copper ore to proceed to mine it. What i got so far (i know, it doesnt even look like a script)

[code]
program Autominer;

procedure mining;
begin
var
 x : Integer;
 y : Integer;
 ClearDebug
 x := 0
 y := 0
 if (FindColor(x,y,4351886,true);
 then (ClickMouse(x,y,True));
end;

begin
end.

              <p>Heya lolmudkips,</p>
<p>Before correcting your code there is a few good things that I should mention, where are your addons? addons have alot of code that you will be needing if you play to code for runescape so use them.</p>
<p>Ok lets begin, so you said you want to create a script that looks for a specific color and clicks if it finds it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (FindColor(x,y,4351886,true);</code></pre>
<p>Findcolor works, but only of the colour you are searching for is static, which in runescape as you allready know they are not. This is why we used a function called -</p>
<p><code>function FindColorSpiralTolerance(var x, y: Integer; color, xs, ys, xe, ye: Integer; Tolerance: Integer): Boolean; 
Works like the regular FindColorSpiral but with a tolerance parameter for finding any similar color. Tolerance is used to find a color in range of the color you are looking for. The greater color range you want, the higher the tolerance parameter should be.</code></p>
<p>The tolerance means that if the colour changes slightly scar will still find it, so thats good news. Now lets move onto your mouse functions, if you didnt allready know then directly clicking a color is very detectable, expsecially when repeated so (as i mentioned) we have includes that provide superior functions for us, in this case -</p>
<p><code>
Mouse(X, Y, randomX, RanomdY, True);
This will move the mouse 'humanly' to the X and Y cooridates with a slight random offset on the click, much less detectable.</code></p>
<p>Now i dont wna to go into too much detail but ive put together a small script that does exactly what you wanted using the SRL include and the functions that I mentioned, please read over it -</p>
<p>[code]<br>
Program RockFinder;<br>
{.include SRL/SRL.scar}</p>
<p>Function GetRockColor : Boolean;<br>
Var<br>
X, Y : Integer;<br>
Tol  : Integer;<br>
Begin repeat<br>
If(FindColorSpiralTolerance(X, Y, 4351886, 1,1,500,500, Tol))Then // searches for the rock color<br>
Begin<br>
If(isuptext(‘Mine’))Then //searches for the text ‘Mine’ to confirm if it is a mining rock<br>
Result:= true;<br>
End;</p>
<pre><code>   If Not result then Tol:= Tol + 1; //increases the tolerance if the rock was not found
   Until Result Or (Tol&gt;=150)
</code></pre>
<p>End;</p>
<p>Begin</p>
<p>SetupSRL; //Sets up our include<br>
GetRockColor;<br>
End.[/code]</p>
