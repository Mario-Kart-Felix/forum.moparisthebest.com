    <title>[PI] NPC taking multiple items</title>

    <description>Sorry if the title doesn&#39;t make much sense, but was the best I could come up with to explain the problem in the title.
So, I am making a quest and during the quest you have to give the NPC 2 items, 1000 of 1 and 1 of the other. But I am getting an error when trying to put this in. Here is what the code looks like:
[code]
case 536:
			if (c.aProMinerStatus == 5) {
				c.getDH().sendPlayerChat2(9830, &quot;Hello Nurmof!&quot;,
						&quot;I am back with the things you asked for.&quot;);
				if (c.getItems().playerHasItem(2358, 1000)) 
					(c.getItems().playerHasItem(15259)) {
					c.nextChat = 537;
				} else {
					c.nextChat = 517;
				}
			} else {
				c.getDH().sendPlayerChat1(9830,
						&quot;Woops! Forgot my items.&quot;);
				c.nextChat = 512;
			}
			break;
[/code]
Here is where I am getting the error:
[code]
					(c.getItems().playerHasItem(15259)) {
[/code]
&quot;(c.getItems().playerHasItem(15259)) {&quot; is where the error comes in on Eclipse.
Here is what the error says:
&quot;Syntax error on token(s), misplaced construct(s)&quot;

From the sounds of it, it is a simple problem of being written wrong. But I can&#39;t figure out how to write it right. Sorry for my dumbness. Thank you for any help in advance!

EDIT: Not sure if this matters, but it is in DialogueHandler.java. And if you need any more pieces of code let me know and I will try to post it.</description>
