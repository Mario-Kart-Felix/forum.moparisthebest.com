    <title>I think I am going to lose my mind</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-think-i-am-going-to-lose-my-mind/88812</link>
    <description>Alright.  So I&#39;ve been coding lots since yesterday.  Everything was great and I was even considering opening up my new server earlier than expected.  I was very pleased to see my progress since a couple weeks ago and I wanted to test out one of the new updates that I made, which was a custom made farming.  So I clicked on run&amp;compile, pressed C, hit enter, AND THEN!:

[code]
client.java:19917: illegal start of expression
}
^
1 error
Files Compiled Successfully!
Press any key to continue . . .
[/code]

This has been driving me to the brink of insanity since yesterday.  I will calmly tell you now that I am about to lose it.  I even ended up deleting everything that I added JUST so that I didn&#39;t have to look at this error anymore.. But it still shows up..EVERY TIME I compile my server.  I haven&#39;t the slightest clue what happened and I bet it&#39;s probably something extremely simple to fix.. But I can&#39;t.  Can you help me achieve my goal and stop this madness?</description>

              <p>Well spank, I tried it last night and I just tried it again just now and all that does is give me the same error with another line.  And BTW in my client at line 19917, there isn’t even a closed bracket!  It was an open bracket which is not what it’s telling me in the error.  This has quickly become ridiculous.</p>
