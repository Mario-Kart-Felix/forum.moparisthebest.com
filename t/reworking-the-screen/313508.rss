              <p>i was figuring i would have to do that but i donâ€™t think it would be that hard to do if i new the methods need for sprite positions. but i would experiment myself but i have a lot of homework example: 500+ essays every week, projects every now and then and tons of math. all together its like school work 24/7. and i dont exactly know where i would start. but could guess.</p>

<p>uggh, personally i cant remember, which method is which. clicking areas are different than sprites, so even if you move it you still need to update the areas.</p>
