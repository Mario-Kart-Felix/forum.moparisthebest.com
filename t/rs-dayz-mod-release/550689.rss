    <title>RS: DayZ Mod Release</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs-dayz-mod-release/550689</link>
    <description>Every time I went make a DayZ concept server my computer would break, it&#39;s been like a curse. Since 2006 I have never released any of my server projects for download. I never saw the point considering how sloppy my work is. I recently found a backup of my latest DayZ server on my phone, that I thought I lost, and so today I am going to make an exception, just in case I lose it again. For more information view my development thread: https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,666997.0

[b]Link removed due to project back in development[/b]: https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,666997.0.html

The base is a real 474 Hyperion (rs2server). I cannot remember if this version has minimap blacking out (need map in inventory and a compass to view minimap/compass, because I had some version control issues which overwrote a days work, and I had to restore it).

Hopefully I can return and improve this once I get my computer fixed.

[b]Disclaimer:[/b]
The code is terrible. Like seriously it&#39;s the Project Insanity of Hyperion and I admit that. Not proud. Going to go away and learn some OOP Java and hopefully re-create something with a bit more quality.

Things that need fixing are:


[ul][li]NPCs don&#39;t combat follow[/li]
[li]Ground items are nulled[/li]
[li]Need to finish the zombie region spawning system[/li]
[li]Need to implement crate looting[/li]
[li]I have a fix for the wilderness ditch[/li]
[li]I have the code for custom object spawning[/li][/ul]


I hope someone can improve on this a lot and maybe make something a little bit better. Like I said my computer broke so anything I was in the middle of doing came to a halt, that&#39;s why there is so many half done systems.

<p>Servers like this <span class="bbcode-i">might</span> be popular.

<p>im confused. so are they popular or are they not popular <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
