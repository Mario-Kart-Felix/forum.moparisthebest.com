<p>I would suggest that the email and recovery question change is made where there is a wait limit to get them changed and fully working. Sort of like runescape’s pending period just not as freaking long.</p>
<p>The second suggestion, is to make it so there is more than one secret question/recovery question. I would suggest personally  seven questions and you have to get at least 4 out of 7 correct to be able to change it.</p>
<p>I suppose five questions would and having 3 out of 5 would be even reasonable.</p>
<p>I would  like to also suggest allowing it for those who ( while I know you aren’t supposed to) who may have a secondary account on here ( unintentionally or if it has been approved by a  staff member ) where the email for recovery etc can be linked to both accounts.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, if a person is phished/keylogged all they have to do is put in their password and the email is automatically changed. A person could even take this a step further, if somebody is ratted they could remote to that persons’s computer and do the changes so it shows the owners ip instead of the hackers.</p>
<p>You see where I am getting at?</p>
<p>I also suggest there should be a waiting time for it to be changed. Similar to bank pins, so that way if the owner gets hacked/ and if it takes a day or so to get his computer clean when he comes back he is able to show appropriate proof by stating what his recovery questions were and the answers to them.</p>
