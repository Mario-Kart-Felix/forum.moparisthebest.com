    <title>LFT - Programmer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lft-programmer/450450</link>
    <description>Hi,

My name is Rick, and I am a professional programmer living in The Netherlands.
I have always had an interest in game development but since I can&#39;t do any 3d modelling / texturing / animating I could never find a team I could work in. For that reason I decided to make a post here hoping there is a team out there that is still looking for a programmer.
The languages I currently use the most are C, D, Java and C#. Besides those I do have experience working with quite a few other programming languages, but they arent common in game development so it seems kind of pointless to list them. Besides being a programmer, I also do network administration and systems management as well as consulting, so I have a very broad skillset that may or may not be useful to your team. 

I do have to note that I work 40 hour weeks and for that reason I am only available on evenings (for +/- 5 hours, starting 19.00) and weekends (pretty much all day unless something comes up, but an 8 hour/day guarantee). 

Please let me know if you can use my help.</description>
