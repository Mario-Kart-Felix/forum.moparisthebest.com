    <title>People who scar doesnt work for anymore</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/people-who-scar-doesnt-work-for-anymore/3491</link>
    <description>If you used to use scar but now it doesnt work properly for you anymore please reply with a brief description of wat is happening. (I am not talking about compiling errors)!!!!!!! (only problems such as the script running with the colors picked but no clicking with lots of lag)!!!!

If we get together all of the people that are having this problem, we can work together and solve this issue that many people are having with their scripts. Never give up!

Also if you have any solutions or suggestions on how to fix this problem feel free to help out.   :)

please i will say it again, HELP!</description>
