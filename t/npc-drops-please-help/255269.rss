    <description>Okay well I made a custom item called New Years Godbow and the ID is 19005 so anyways I wanted to make a new years event so I spawned some skeletons in a spot and then compiled to check if they were there and they were there. So next, I went to npc drops and put this right under the label...
[code]//--------NPCID---------DropType--------Item----Amount--
npcdrop = 90		1		19005	1	[/code]
so that 90=skeletons drops 19005=new years god bow and amount=1 and then i did file save and then compiled and then I killed like 10 of them and they never dropped so could someone please tell me how to fix this
-thx
