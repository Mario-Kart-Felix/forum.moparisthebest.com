    <title>Obama calls Assad to step down</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday for the first time called on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down after a brutal crackdown by Syrian forces on demonstrations against the Assad family&#39;s 41-year reign.

The president also imposed a fresh round of American sanctions to freeze all Syrian government assets under U.S. jurisdiction and to bar U.S. individuals or companies from transactions with Assad&#39;s government.

The moves are intended to ratchet up pressure on Assad, who has used his military and security forces to attack protesters seeking an end to four decades of authoritarian rule by the Syrian president and his late father, Hafez al-Assad.

While the United States has previously called for Assad to embark on democratic reforms or to get out of the way, Obama&#39;s statement marks the first explicit call for him to go.

His decision to make a direct appeal for Assad&#39;s departure appears to reflect a U.S. conclusion that Assad is incapable of reform as well as growing condemnation of the Syrian leader, including from influential Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia.

&quot;The future of Syria must be determined by its people, but President Bashar al-Assad is standing in their way. His calls for dialogue and reform have rung hollow while he is imprisoning, torturing, and slaughtering his own people,&quot; Obama said in a statement announcing the sanctions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
