    <title>~~~ so long ~~ Intrested users read? ~~~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-long-intrested-users-read/167775</link>
    <description>to begin this is &#39;the&#39; last message I&#39;ll place on moparscape pserver section. I thought I did put the last message in my client development thread but as soon as I found out the development leader of the game we were going to create first had to go to america for some business I was back to these forums to chissel of some time because I didn&#39;t really had something to do unless practice some with graphics.
Now I have a fulltime job as GFX&#39;er and I don&#39;t really have to chissel of time.

I also gave some reputation to some persons that where good in the time I knew them, or persons that I appriciated. So mods don&#39;t have to take the reputation of those persons thinking I was abusing the Rep system.
my total time logged in was: 16 days, 6 hours and 3 minutes in the past year and a half.
I might be breaking a rule by posting this in 2 different sections but I don&#39;t care what I get (mute, warned, whatever) but I do not leave spamming.

So long.</description>
