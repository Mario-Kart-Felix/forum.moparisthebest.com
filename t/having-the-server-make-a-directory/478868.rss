    <title>Having the server make a directory?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/having-the-server-make-a-directory/478868</link>
    <description>Well, in allstar, if anyone has ever used it before. They know it has like 4 files per character. Instead of it saving all those across 4 folders or what ever. I wanted to make it so it would create 1 folder per user, and save all 4 files in that. Anyone know how to have the buffered writer do that?</description>
