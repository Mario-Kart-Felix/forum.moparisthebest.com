    <title>Microsoft vs Google vs Apple</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/microsoft-vs-google-vs-apple/519377</link>
    <description>Many of you skiddies don&#39;t know this but once Microsoft got on top of the world they realized they wouldn&#39;t be in that position forever and decided to invest a large cash stack into other companies such as apple, best buy, facebook etc etc. 

So I would first like to point out that Microsoft is already a winner. They gave up the throne willingly and now Google is the top dog. Apple finally was in a position to take over the world but lost that vision when Steve Jobs passed away. In recent news Apple is fading away with their 120 billion dollars in the bank, failing to reinvest it into other companies or utilize it to take on their competition. 

Google is soaring and has proved their dominance in every aspect of the market: Advertising, Books, Music, Superior Search Engine, Maps, Android OS etc etc. 

With the information you know about these companies from your own beliefs, experience or what you have heard...

Which company do you favor?
If you can give advice to any of the three companies on what they should do next, what advice would you give them?
Do you think Facebook or Yahoo even have a chance?</description>

<p>i have to agree because a good portion of the idiots going with ps4 dont even know jack shit about it and just jump on the bandwagon, much like apple<br>

<p>What does apple have to do with sony???</p>
<p>and what is there to need to know? Sony showed that its <span class="bbcode-b">cheaper</span> than the xbox one and the game trailers they showed for it at E3 was a really good look of how the games were going to look on the PS4, they proved that its better than the xbox1 you fcking idiot of course more people are going to get the PS4[/quote]<br>
just saw this<br>
Maybe if you took your head out of your ass, you’d realize that alot of that is subjective, and really different people would like different things, but since people dont even look into what happened and just jumped on sonys dick acting like it was fact that it was better in every way possible, well thats what i was referring to you “fcking idiot”</p>

[/quote]</p>
<p>Why death to apple? If they get their shit together they can be superior. They have 120 billion in the bank yet fail to put it to use. They have the potential to take on google and microsoft (as they have already proven). Really… does one guy make all the difference?  Apple is very limited because of their failure to adapt. They will be ran over like they never existed unless the reach outside the box.[/quote]It’s not always about the money.  They’re all about ripping off their customers while they have ZERO clue about it.  Hell, a whole new market opened up because of Apple.  Yano, that one where rich people trade in their old phones so they can buy the brand new one? (knowing that 5-6 months prior, they released yet another under the market product, but still claimed to be pioneers)  They don’t build any of their devices to last.  They’re always one step behind the market, but for some reason they were able to put together so many fuckin’ fanboys that they can keep making commercials.</p>

Google with their <span class="bbcode-b">Android</span> operating systems, <span class="bbcode-b">dominate</span> the <span class="bbcode-b">mobile</span> operating systems. And are very customize-able for mobile devices.</p>

For<span class="bbcode-b"> mobile devices, Apple wins.</span> (iPad, iPods, etc.)<br>

<p>Obviously they are not dominate if iOS has more users. Don’t contradict yourself and provide facts please.</p>
<p>The other day I saw a bunch of mac fags buy a computer for $1400 that I could of bought for $600 and installed iOS on it…[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not contradicting myself. Mobile devices, and mobile operating systems are two completely different things, am I right? Apple does a great job when it comes to the hardware of iPads, iPhones, iPods, etc.</p>
<p>However, there’s no doubt that Android is dominate when it comes to the operating system. iOS isn’t too good, too simple.</p>
<p>On topic:</p>
<p>I think we all can come to a mutual agreement that Apple beats Microsoft and Google when it comes to using the same letter in every device/software name. Lmao</p>

The Ps3 was overpriced too. Many things Sony release are overpriced but they caters to all markets so that is to be expected. As a whole, I like Sony; they release good quality products.<br>

<p>The PS3 wasn’t overpriced when you look at it on paper though. Sure, the PS3 was <span class="bbcode-b">ridiculously expensive</span> at launch, so much so that Sony <span class="bbcode-b">sold the PS3 at a loss</span> for quite some time. But for that initial £425 price tag, you got the cheapest Bluray player, you got a removable hard-drive, you could play PS2 games, you had built in wifi, and you had HDMI from launch. The launch Xbox’s didn’t have HDMI until 2007 (conveniently when the PS3 was released, <span class="bbcode-b">WITH HDMI</span>), launch Xbox’s had no wifi (with the official dongle being $100), and depending on the model the launch Xbox’s didn’t have a harddrive, at £209 and £279 respectively.</p>
<p>The PS3 dropped the price to £399 quickly after launch, and 8 months later in November 2007 Sony released the 40gb PS3 at £299. In August 2007 Microsoft had came out with the Xbox Elite, which I believe finally had wifi, being priced at oh, look at that, £299.</p>
<p>So sure, the PS3 may have been overpriced at launch compared to launch 360 models, but the 360 models were gimped and when they finally weren’t gimped they came out competitively priced with each other. I feel it’s a cheap tactic, but there’s a reason the 360 launch models were so cheap, a reported 34% failure rate.[/quote]<br>
Wut. Well they attempted to add in far too much then. It is well known one of the reasons why the PS3 wasn’t as successful as the Xbox 360 is because of it’s price tag aka the ps3 was overpriced; I’m not talking about the value ratio as that’s subjective + I cba.</p>

There really is no competing with Google. I mean, shit, they have been working on self-driven cars.</p>

<p>and what is there to need to know? Sony showed that its <span class="bbcode-b">cheaper</span> than the xbox one and the game trailers they showed for it at E3 was a really good look of how the games were going to look on the PS4, they proved that its better than the xbox1 you fcking idiot of course more people are going to get the PS4</p>
