    <description>This Guide Consists Of A Bunch Of Tutorials That People Are ALWAYS Asking...

-Making A Safezone
-Making An Object Give Exp / Teleport

[b]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[/b]
[size=18pt][b]Adding An Object[/b][/size]

[b]Step One:[/b]
Go Into Client.java (This Is A File Named &quot;Client&quot; Commenly Opened In Notepad...)

[b]Step Two:[/b]
Press Ctrl + F And A Search Box Should Pop Up, Then Type In &lt;blockquote&gt;makeglobalob&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Step Three:
When You Find Something Like This...[code]makeGlobalObject(3306, 3204, 2783, 0, 10);//anvil[/code]
(Should Be Two Searchs Away)

Step Four:
Copy One Of Them, Then Paste It Again..And Change It To What You Want...This Is What Each Thing Means!
&lt;blockquote&gt;makeGlobalObject(X-Co-Ord[b],[/b] Y-Co-Ord[b],[/b] Object Id Number[b],[/b] Which Way It Faces[b], [/b]10); //Reference For What Item Is! (Doesnt Effect Anything)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Step Five: 
Save And Compile, Then Turn Off Run.bat And Turn Back On For It To Take Effect.
[b]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[/b]
[size=18pt][b]Making A Safezone[/b][/size]

Now, As A Beginner This Is One Of The Hardest Things To Do. So Ill Make It REALLY Simple.

Step One:
Open Client.Java And Search For..&lt;blockquote&gt;public boolean nonWild() {&lt;/blockquote&gt; ( C &amp; P That)

Step Two:
Look At The Code...Each &quot;Safezone&quot; Is Made Of This...&lt;blockquote&gt;(absX &gt;= 3039 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3111 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3475 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=3523 ) ||&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Step Three: 
This Is What It Means..
&lt;blockquote&gt;(absX &gt;= The X Co-Ord In The Southwest Corner. &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= The X Co-Ord In The Northeast Corner. &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= The Y Co-Ord In The Southwest Corner. &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=The Y Co-Ord In The Northeast Corner. ) ||&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now The || Means You Can Put Another One Next To It Without 100 Errors.

Now Ill Explain How This Works.

[img]http://www.wildyscape.biz/imageuploadeder/U4-1206864523.jpg[/img]

Now When You Enter Those Co-Ords They Shoot Invs Lines Up And Across...And Where Ever The Lines Meet...Creates A Box!! Which Is Your Safe Zone!

Step Four:
Save, Compile Restart Server..And Should Take Effect.
[b]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[/b]
[size=18pt][b]Making An Object Give EXP / Teleport[/b][/size]

Step One: 
Open Client.java And Search For..&lt;blockquote&gt;switch(objectID) {&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under That Copy And Paste This..
&lt;blockquote&gt;case ####:
if(GoodDistance2(absX, absY, objectX, objectY, 3)) {
	if(actionTimer == 0)
	{
		sendMessage(&quot; *************** &quot;);
		actionTimer = 10;
		setAnimation( #### );
		addSkillXP((750*playerLevel[2]), 2);
                stillgfx(246, absY, absX);
                updateRequired = true;
                appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
	}
}
break;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Step Three:
This Is What It All Means!
&lt;blockquote&gt;case OBJECT ID NUMBER:
		sendMessage(&quot;The Message You Receive When You Click It&quot;);
		actionTimer = ## (How Long Between Each Click Allowed);
		setAnimation(1658); The Animation Which Your Player Does When Click The Object
		addSkillXP((750*playerLevel[2]), 2); The 750 = Amount Of Xp...The [2] And 2) Is Which Skill The XP Goes To.. 2 Is Strength.
                stillgfx(246, absY, absX); The 246 Is The Graphics Which Will Happen When You Use
                updateRequired = true; // This Is Needed But You Dont Need To Know What It Does
                appearanceUpdateRequired = true; // This Is Needed But You Dont Need To Know What It Does
} 
break; // This Is Needed But You Dont Need To Know What It Does&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Step Four:
Change To What You Want, Save Compile And Restart To Take Effect.

 ~~~ List Of Skills ~~~ (Like [2] For Strength Etc)

[0] Hitpoints
[1] Attack
[2] Strength
[3] Defence
[4] Range
[5] Prayer
[6] Magic

To Make It Teleport You, Do The SAME Thing EXCEPT!     Add The Following..Instead Of The Other Code.
&lt;blockquote&gt;case OBJECT ID: // Reference
teleportToX = X Co-Ord;
teleportToY = Y Co-Ord;
sendMessage(&quot;Message Once You Clicked Object&quot;);
break;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Simple..Change Those to What You Want, Save Compile, Restart..Done =] Its ALL Explained!
[b]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[/b]
[size=18pt][b]How To Change Start Zone / Death Area[/b][/size]

This One Is SOOO Easy! We Will Use Something I Call Commen Sense!

~~~ Changing Start Zone ~~~

Step One: 
Log Onto A New Account And Before Moving, See What Your Co-Ords Are.

Step Two: 
Open PLAYER.java And Search For The X-Co-Ord,

Step Three:
Once Found Change BOTH X And Y Co-Ords To Where You Would Like New Players To Start!

Step Four:
SCR (Save, Compile, Restart) And Your Done!

 ~~~ Changing Where You Go When You Die ~~~

Step One:
Log Onto Your Server..And Die!

Step Two:
WITHOUT Moving Look At Your Co-Ords.

Step Three:
Go Into CLIENT.java And Search For Those Co-Ords Until You Find Them Usen Ctrl + F

Step Four:
SCR ( Save, Compile, Restart) And Your Done!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[size=18pt][b]How To Change Start Equipment[/b][/size]

Step One:
Log On, And Get The Code For Something You Are Wearing When You Start.

Step Two:
Go Into PLAYER.java And CTRL + F That Code
And Search For That Code..Then It Pretty Much Explains Itself..
It Looks Like This..
&lt;blockquote&gt;//Giving the player an unique look
		                playerEquipment[playerHat]=-1; // Put Hat ID Number Where -1 Is
                playerEquipment[playerCape]= -1; // Put Cape ID Number Where -1 Is
                playerEquipment[playerAmulet]= -1; // Put Amulet ID Number Where -1 Is
                playerEquipment[playerChest]= -1; // Put Chest ID Number Where -1 Is
                playerEquipment[playerShield]= 1191; // Put Sheild ID Number Where 1191 Is
                playerEquipment[playerLegs]= -1; // Put Legs ID Number Where -1 Is
                playerEquipment[playerHands]= 12436; // Put Gloves ID Number Where 12436 Is
                playerEquipment[playerFeet]= -1; // Put Boots ID Number Where -1 Is
                playerEquipment[playerRing]= -1; // Put Ring ID Number Where -1 Is
                playerEquipment[playerArrows]= -1; // Put Arrows ID Number Where -1 Is
                playerEquipment[playerWeapon]= 1323; // Put Weapon ID Number Where 1323 Is&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

NOTE: Put -1 If You Want NOTHING To Be There =]

Step Three:
SCR ( Save, Compile, Restart) And Your Done!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ill Add More Tomorrow..But Now....YOU HAVE A UNIQUE SERVER!

Thanks..Adding More..Keep Alive</description>
