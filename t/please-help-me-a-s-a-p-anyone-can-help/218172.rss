    <description>Hello Moparscapers!

I have been looking for a tutorial which makes your server compatible with silabsoft item ids (1000+)
But I think Tico135&#39;s tutorial got deleted or something.

Could you get me the link to one and I will reward you.
And No, I don&#39;t wanna use another source.</description>
