    <title>Error_game_invalidhost.ws - Shouldn&#39;t have this error, What have i done wrong?</title>

    <description>Hi,

I have made a 562 web client, i jar&#39;d it like i was ment to and i even edited the signlink.java, client.java and applet.java so everything should be working. I have had no problems with the compiler, the compiler says everything is coded correctly.

When i jar&#39;d the client i also generated a batch file too and the batch file opens with no errors and then starts downloading the client but however i do not get this on my website, i get the error_game_invalidhost.ws.

This is what i get when i open the batch file:

and i get the same thing to when i open the jar file. The cache gets downloaded.
After the cache is downloaded the client is stuck at &quot;Connecting to server&quot;. But i have checked the client ip that its trying to connect to and it is correct and is also online.</description>
