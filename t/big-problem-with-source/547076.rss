              <p>I have no idea what revision it is, but I will try my best to help. Check either client.java or player.java and look for “isinwild” or something like that, and then do a quick search for “duel”. If there is no duel then you can take the isinwild coordinates, make a new void for “isinduel” and use make it not drop items.</p>
