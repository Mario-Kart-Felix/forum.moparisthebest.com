    <title>Problem with jarring the client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-jarring-the-client/537178</link>
    <description>Hey, i have a PI Client. I&#39;m trying to jar it, but always when i create the jar, it doesn&#39;t open up. Before every client got jarred perfectly and worked, but this doesn&#39;t? Maybe because my .class files are not located after /bin/ ? Because if i go on /bin/ there is another directory called /com/, and in this directory are the class files located. (Some class files are located in a few directorys too, example: /bin/com/blabla/meow.class

Anyone?</description>
