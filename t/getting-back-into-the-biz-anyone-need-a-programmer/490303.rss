    <title>Getting back into the biz, anyone need a programmer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-back-into-the-biz-anyone-need-a-programmer/490303</link>
    <description>Hey guys, some of you may remember me/know me other probably not. I have created several server&#39;s some of which i released and did not. anyways i have been in-active due to IRL stuff for about the last 2 to 3 years.

Basically, i really enjoy coding and would love to help someone if they ever need it. I have plenty of experience under my belt. If it was up to me... i would run my own, but hosting is not an option for me.

So if anyone needs an experienced programmer for whetever reasons just send me a message.
