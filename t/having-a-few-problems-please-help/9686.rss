Hi, im starting my first server. Im using the project 16 source because it has lots of preinstalled features. Ive looked at many tuts and started developing.

My first problem is this. I opened my character&#39;s txt file that i wanted admin and i changed player rights to 3 which shows ownership. When i logged in and spoke i didnt have a Gold crown.

My second problem is this. In client.java i found the welcome messages and edited them to say what i wanted. However when i logged in it still had the default source message.

Id really appreciate some help. Please bear with me as i only know very basic coding.

Another thing, i edited the stats on the character file and that wroked fine. So somthing must be right.</description>

              <p>Ok the answer is why you don’t have a gold crown is because if you set it to 3 you won’t see it but other people can.<br>
The answer to your second problem is that you save it.Close the running bot and the project 16 thingy then open it again so the server notices the changes.Oh yeah and the first answer i know is right but the second one i’m not pretty sure.</p>
