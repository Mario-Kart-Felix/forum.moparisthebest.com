    <title>I have four simple questions about my private server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-four-simple-questions-about-my-private-server/388167</link>
    <description>Please Don&#39;t remove topic if it&#39;s in wrong section, it took a while to post this :( Could you allow it please? I&#39;m not sure if this is where I am to post this, but here are my questions.

[b]Reward for answering questions:[/b] [b]Rep+[/b]

[b]My first question is:[/b] Do you know how when you double click run.bat or whatever it is, you sometimes get a cmd and a client loading right? Well my cmd is named, &quot;your client&quot; and I&#39;d like to change it to my servers name.

Could someone tell me how to change that to what I want it to be?

[b]My second question is:[/b] How do I change the title of the client (on the title bar)? Right now it says, &quot;Core pking by Core&quot; I&#39;d like to change that to my servers name.

This is a side question: How do I change where it says, &quot;HyBriD PvP is loading - please wait...&quot; You know when you wait for a private server to load theres a red bar going higher and higher each time it loads a part of something. And there is a text on top of the loading bar.

How do I change that text?

[b]Third question:[/b] How do I change where it shows above &quot;Login&quot; and &quot;New User&quot;, &quot;Welcome to RuneScape&quot; but in this case, &quot;Welcome to HyBriD PvP.&quot;

[img]http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/1618/picture3rl.png[/img]

[b]My fourth question is:[/b] How do I change the text for when you click the option, &quot;New User&quot; and it tells you &quot;Create a free account&quot; and the text under those words telling how you create a free account.

[b][size=36pt]When answering these questions, please state which file I look in, what I search for, and I guess how I change it lol..[/size][/b] :P</description>

<p>By the way. If you upload a link to your client I can help you look for it.</p>

              <p>Well … basically you just need to open up client.java and search for “Core Pking by Core” and also look for “HyBrid PvP” in that same file.</p>
<p>For the Command Prompt when you right click on it click on “edit” and look for a line that starts with “title” and then put your servers name after that.</p>
<p>As for the background. You will have to find a new image and replace the old one with yours.</p>
