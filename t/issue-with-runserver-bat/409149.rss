    <title>Issue with runserver.bat</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/issue-with-runserver-bat/409149</link>
    <description>I have a problem with my runserver.bat

First my run.bat just opened and closed, i added pause then it said it could find the batch intern extern blabla

so i redid my PATHS and compiled (the compiler is working perfect without errors)

now it says this: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;error occurred during initialization of VM Could not reserve enough space for object heap
error: could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
error: Fatal exception has occurred program will exit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I totally lost it now, never saw something like this before, i hope someone can help me

thanks in advance


Problem fixed:
working code:

[code]@echo off
title RandomScape, sourced by Dallas Nathan Mitchell, coded by RandQm (Version: 1.0)
color 0f
echo ----------------------------------------------------
echo     RandomScape, made by RandQm.

echo System: RandomScape loader is currently using RandomScapeserver1.10
java -Xmx512m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.08-ga-bin.jar server
pause
