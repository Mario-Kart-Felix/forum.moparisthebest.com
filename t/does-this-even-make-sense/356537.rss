    <title>Does this even make sense?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-this-even-make-sense/356537</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not sure if this is really the right place to put this but I figure it&#39;s something to discuss so w/e lol. Ok so pure2ownage, krackkid, and chaos. The 3 ppl noone really seem to like here from what I&#39;ve seen and the whole apolagy thing. How come all of them have 200 rep? Whatsup with that?

Also on another note this may be a stupid question (plz don&#39;t hate for me asking) but what exactly would you guys define as a troll?

Edit: I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m posting so many topics in the General Discussion section. This is the last one till all mine are off the front page =p. I don&#39;t wanna be a spammer.</description>

Shut up shut up shut up. They get their rep because people acknowledge them as you are by making a whole thread for them. Rep is a number that represents how much of a socialistic piece of garbage you are, in addition to you see how many posts you can put on this site by the end of the night.</p>

<p>Before moderation, I thought ReaperX was pretty chill and liked to have fun. Outside of mopar, it is probably that way. Since his promotion, I believe he needs to put serious mode on (with an occasion of humor).</p>
