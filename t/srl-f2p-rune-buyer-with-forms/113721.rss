What does it do?
This script buys any F2P rune that you want from either Betty&#39;s Magic Emporium or Aubury&#39;s Rune Shop. Currently no world-switching(if I get good feedback on this script, next version will be with world-switching).

Features:
 -Antiban
 -MultiPlayer
 -Forms(Easy setup :))
 -Works in either Betty&#39;s Magic Emporium or Aubury&#39;s Rune Shop
 -And the usual features that you would want a script like this to have.

How to setup?
[size=9pt] -Make sure the specify a RS client
 -Declare the players in DeclarePlayers procedure(also make sure that all the users are in either Betty&#39;s Magic Emporium or Aubury&#39;s Rune Shop)
 -Click run
 -Edit the settings in the form to your liking
 -Press start, and your done[/size]

[B]If you download this script and use it, please post some feedback.[/B]
I didn&#39;t save any progress reports, but the script worked fine for me for 12+ hours. Please post some progress reports or bugs that you find.</description>
