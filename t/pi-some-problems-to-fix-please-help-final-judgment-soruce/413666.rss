    <description>[center][size=14pt]Problems to Fix:[/size][/center]

1. Skills

-Smithing when you try to smelt on the furnance (any bar) , and when you try to smith something on an anvil the client crashes, but when you log in, you actually got the xp/lvl up on smithing. What I want to fix is the crashing when Smelting/Smithing.

-Fletching when you try to cut logs with knife, string, same as Smithing, client crashes, and you recive xp/lvl up.

-Fishing I try to fix (with my fishing net on inventory) but I don&#39;t start fishing... I think im missing the fish gfx or I really don&#39;t know.

I&#39;ll post anything you need , just tell me what to do.

NOTE: I click on the furnance, select the bar then the screen goes, Loading Please Wait...then Connection Lost.

2. Multi zones 
 
How do I make the Kalphite Lair Multi?, It does have the &#39;Multi zone sign&#39; but you 2 can&#39;t attack. The KQ.

3. Weapon Staces

Well I have Chaotic Rapier, Korasi &amp; Vesta long on my server. But I don&#39;t like the weapon stances... however the gravite rapier has the stance I want to have with chaotic rapier, korasi &amp; vls. Where &amp; how do I change that?

Is it client sided? and in which file?

4. Summoning

Does anyone know how to activate / make work the summoning botton to take out all the items of the following familiars:
Spirit Terror bird
War Tortise
Pack-Yack

I hope you guys can help me with any of this problems.

Thanks!
