    <description>http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,133199.0.html

why isnt there a forum games section? it would stop all the general discussion games that are not general discussions.  Honestly do you play the 3 word game with your friends when you are trying to talk about something other than the three word game?  or do you randomly pull out a picture and say whats wrong with this picture while you are trying to talk about a class assignment because you missed a day of school or something???

I personally think we should have one (right below general discussion so everyone can see it)
