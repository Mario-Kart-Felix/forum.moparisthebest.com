    <description>[center][b][size=24pt]Development of Project PkScape[/size][/b]
New Online Image Counter..
[img]http://fashionpotato.com/online.php[/img]

[size=8pt](I&#39;ll be updating the thread whenever I do updates, everything below is updated as of September 09, 2011.)[/size]

Details:
Developers: Me.
msn: thedjinn123@hotmail.com
Type? Pk Server - EasyRsc (Cbf to setup rsca, easier for people to just login instead of registering).
F2P or P2P: F2P
Wilderness Reduced by half
Webclient: In Process of being made.
EXP Rate: 200x (Meant to be easy).
Max Stat: 99
Registration: Login with any Username &amp; Password
Master Fisher: Free Lobster
World?: Might Reduce the world to only Edgeville &amp; The North of the wilderness connected to edgeville - Suggestions?
Dueling?: It will stay added in, people like dueling. (So part p2p, dueling wise unless voted to be taken out.)
Free Items: Strength/Diamond amulet spawn in edgeville

[b]Commands:[/b]
::stuck
::say
::spree (Username) 
::wild (How many people in the wild)
::pkp (How many pk points you have)
::setstat statname 40  (Might remove this due to the ease of the exp rate).
(Max you can set your stats is 40, you can also reduce your stats any less than 40 if you want it higher, you must train).

There will be PkPoints - I&#39;m not sure what to do with these yet though.

On the Left there is a Magical Portal leading to 3 places, on the Right it is showing the reduced size of the wilderness

This Image shows a party hat loot after killing someone, as in everytime you kill someone you get a chance to get 1 item randomly out of 300 or so items. This was just a test. It won&#39;t be dropping party hats.

[b]What has been done?[/b]
Not much really..I just started this last night. 
What you can do? Well, when you log in you will start with 10k and a iron 2-handed sword. To obtain money/items you can either train, or pk.

Pking Rewards(Chances to get a good item on drop): You can get Rune Items, crappy items, and such. It depends on random luck.

[b]Wilderness?:[/b] 
The wilderness has been reduced to half its size due to the low population of the RSC Scene, only the wilderness from edgville to the north exist. Except P2P wild which has been removed as well.
I remembered a server called &quot;Piru Online&quot;, so I added like a &quot;Tree Box&quot; in edgeville some what like they did. Only idea I took from them.

[b]Training Spots:[/b]
Basically Edgeville Dungeon &amp; The wilderness
Fire Giants are located far back in edgeville Dungeon they drop rune armor quite often, but not to often since we want a value on items or pking would get boring quite quick. (Remember if you don&#39;t like training, you can always try and pk for chances at rune drops).


[b]Note:[/b]
This server will be put up, I can put it up at any time but I chose not to right now since I want to do a lot more things and get your guys ideas on what should be done.

What kind of things should be added to the F2P Pk Server? Suggest away, if its a good idea I&#39;ll add it in! For example the Stork feel? With it displaying what weapon the person killed you with, or something I can&#39;t think of ideas.. Idk you decide.
I&#39;m looking to add anything that will attract you guys to play. I could careless what you want to say bad about it, I&#39;m just looking to get a F2P Server up. If you want to beta test before I put it up, add me on my MSN. or Reply here.

<p>I know, it just seems different. (Since a lot of code has been modified in the client I’m using). I have a headache right now anyways from starting at the computer screen to long. I’ll probably make the webclient tomorrow, or in a couple days. But ermm. I guess I’ll make an advertisement for the server.</p>
<p>Consider this project done, (will still be updating via advertisement).</p>

<p>Are you really trying to look for workarounds and fixes for EasyRSC just so you don’t have to learn SQL? That’s obviously the case since Luke and others have pointed out that EasyRSC obviously isn’t stable and you still choose to use it because you don’t know SQL.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I never said I didn’t know SQL… I chose to use it because I wanted to. The players online count and such obviously involves SQL and obviously a MySql Driver, which I added in so that should speak for it self. I’m obviously just improving easyRsc. I don’t know why people act like things can’t be fixed such as stability. For example, when xEnt hosted BeyondRsc his was stable and such, I also believe it had over 100 players? His base was EasyRsc. Which can be stable.<br>
Edit: Also people are not going to care which and who’s framework I am using. It’s the gameplay that gets the players.</p>

Also I need to decide on a EXP rate for the server.<br>
Any suggestions?</p>

I might make a Menu that will popup, like a market to exchange your pk points instead of using a npc. I’m not sure what all to do yet though.<br>
Going to add an online counter which will update the database each time someone logs in, for example</p>
<p>currentlyOnline: 20</p>
<p>Then going to make a file and it will be a image counting how many people are online the server which I can place anywhere on the forums. (In my post). Just having a bit of trouble making the online counter right now.</p>

<p>It’s easy, but not so easy the items will be worth not picking up. There are numerous ways to get Armour and such. Either buy them from the shops, kill fire giants, or PK for random drops to see if you get that lucky rune drop. Lobsters are free, but if you want swordfish it costs 5 pk points for 25 to be added to your bank. Pots are cheap, they’re in the shop. Rune’s are in the shops as well. We’ll be hoping to get the server up soon.</p>

              <p>Just finished creating the PkPoint Exchanger.<br>
What does it do?<br>
You obtain 1 pk point per kill obviously,<br>
for 5 pk points you can get 25 swordfish added to your bank.<br>
Lobsters are free from the Master Fisher (I might make it tuna and make lobsters obtainable by pk points as well).<br>
More items can be added to the Pk Point exchange, I just need suggestions. The only thing added right now is 25 Swordfish for 5 Pk Points.</p>
<p>I removed the Pk Point in the ‘Skills’ Menu since it was not working as intended. To view how many pk points you have<br>
you can type</p>
<p>::pkp<br>
“You have X PkPoints.” (I’ll be making a menu in the client soon).</p>
<p>Fixed a few bugs with the Random Dropping System.<br>
Added another portal in edge so its more noticeable.<br>
Changed some NPC’s that weren’t meant suppose to be in certain areas.<br>
Fixed the Players in view crash (I believe, would need to test it.)<br>
And a lot of other things…</p>
<p>ETA of the Server: Maybe September 10th, or September 11th.</p>
<p>Like I said I’m taking in all Suggestions, if they’re good. Please give me ideas.</p>
