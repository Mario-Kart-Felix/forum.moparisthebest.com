    <title>Fun PK Question - RUSE PS Source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fun-pk-question-ruse-ps-source/553476</link>
    <description>Hey guys, first off I&#39;m using the RUSE PS source and trying to make it different, I don&#39;t want the server to be you know.. a &#39;full-on&#39; leech. The idea that came to me was, if it&#39;s possible to somehow make a fun pk zone that allows a player to use ::item (id) (amount) on an economy server. BUT once you die, you lose all the items and the items are not dropped on the ground. Or, if you teleport out, you lose the items you spawned as well. In order to enter the zone, you must bank your items. Is this possible? I&#39;m thinking it kind of sounds like the dungeoneering methods except the command would be different. Anyone know how I would make the command for ::item? I know it would have to be something along the lines &quot;if x = ?? and y == ??&quot;. Please help, thank you :).

<p>I think ruse would classify as an rs3 source. Being a 525 i think it was.</p>
<p>i like the idea but i’m somewhat annoyed with all these ruse sources.</p>
