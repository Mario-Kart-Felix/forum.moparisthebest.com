    <title>The End of the Universe</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-end-of-the-universe/175172</link>
    <description>The question popped up when I was talking to my sis&#39;s boyfriend about stuff like the 4th dimension, evolution, the origin of the universe, etc. Is there really and end to the universe, where the meaning of end being a boundary or something? The universe surely can&#39;t have an end, but then again it can&#39;t go on forever. And if there&#39;s an end, where&#39;s the beginning of the universe. Certain ideologies come into play here, i.e. the 4th dimension,time travel, and other things.

<p>[quote=“Yz85Racer, post:23, topic:175671”]No. Global warming is a myth, the Earth <span class="bbcode-b">is</span> heating up, but the Earth goes in 10 year cycles. One decade will be rainy, next will be sweltering drought. Look up the temperatures for that last 10 and the 10 before that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

Nope, but geologists have.<br>
Climatology just means that the planet is getting warmer, which is true. There should be a reason.</p>
<p>It being our fault is just bullshit.</p>

<p>Everybody is making a big deal out of nothing. Who gives a shit if its getting hotter. As long as we are here on the earth with nobody constantly bitching about the same dumbass thing over and over again, I think we’ll all be fine living our lives.</p>

The question popped up when I was talking to my sis’s boyfriend about stuff like the 4th dimension, evolution, the origin of the universe, etc. Is there really and end to the universe, where the meaning of end being a boundary or something? The universe surely can’t have an end, but then again it can’t go on forever. And if there’s an end, where’s the beginning of the universe. Certain ideologies come into play here, i.e. the 4th dimension,time travel, and other things.</p>

<p>Along with my first question, does anyone believe that there are other “intelligent” life forms in the universe besides humans. There has to be, because what are the chances that we are the only life forms that can contemplate our place in the universe? To add, where did we even come from, how did all life originate on Earth in the first place? How did everything of known existence begin? Where did that object the size of an atom that supposedly created the universe come from?</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s stupid to think there is not. Lets say for a moment that the chance of there being life on any one given planet is 1 in one octillion, which is an incredibly slim chance. It’s still far fetched to even entertain the idea of there not being life on other planets.</p>

<p>We cannot comprehend these “directions” (or higher dimensions), as, obviously, they do not exist in the 3rd dimension. So they cannot be defined by length, width, or height, so in our dimension, they are only theoretical. Therefore, it’s impossible to prove we exist.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s the point I was trying to make to my sis’s boyfriend last night; he said that there had to be limits to everything because of certain laws like physic and such. The thing is, these laws that are used to explain what we (humans) have found can’t place limits, or any kind of restriction upon anything in the known universe for that matter because the basis that they’re set on can’t really be explained.</p>
<p>Along with my first question, does anyone believe that there are other “intelligent” life forms in the universe besides humans. There has to be, because what are the chances that we are the only life forms that can contemplate our place in the universe? To add, where did we even come from, how did all life originate on Earth in the first place? How did everything of known existence begin? Where did that object the size of an atom that supposedly created the universe come from?</p>
<p>Most of these question will most likely never have an answer, but I wanted to see what the people on this forum had in thought.</p>
