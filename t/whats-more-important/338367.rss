I would say all 3. Everything in a game is intertwined with eachother. I mean, you can’t have good graphics unless you have good programming. (you wouldn’t be able to render high quality graphics without good programming.)</p>
<p>Sorry for the somewhat incoherent post.<br>

i was assuming the OP was referring to the gameplay programming (ie: picking up weapons, shooting, etc).[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, that could be how he was referring to it. Now that I have actually reread the other posts in this thread, especially your post above my first post, I really do agree that graphics play a big part in choosing the games you buy.</p>

That makes sense also, the programming behind the rendering algorithms in the 3d engines.</p>
<p>Programming dominates every type of media, but i was assuming the OP was referring to the gameplay programming (ie: picking up weapons, shooting, etc).</p>

I would prefer good gameplay and decent graphics. And hope for the best of both.</p>
<p>This is crysis, when this game was released the creators said no computers capable of running this game on maximum settings would be available in stores for about 2 years.<br>

<p>Now you have to admit, graphics is what everyone looks for at first. If i see a game with horrible rushed textures in gameinformer i flip the page very quickly. As soon as i see something beautiful i start to read about it and the story, which ultimately ends up of the purchase. Graphics and story are what drives people to buy games, hoping the programming will be playable.</p>

<p>Notice how jagex is attempting to keep the graphics up to the current generation, it shows they care and the players also care about graphics. I know i would never buy a game that looks like the graphics were rushed just because the gameplay was good. You also have to remember graphic styles, like just cause and grand theft auto.</p>
<p>The only reason we loved the 317 versions wasn’t because of the graphics, it was what held all the memories we have had playing and its how we were used to when we first found out about the game. If you take a player that started playing in 2009 or 2010 they would say the new version is better.</p>
<p>Also, most of the people here are ignorant, so of course they think they can program and they will say programming is better. Even though i can do both and i still say both, its different.</p>

<p>Again very true…I guess my favorite classic games don’t need them.</p>
<p>I guess this is one of them questions where it goes by the point of view of the person, and what they like in a game, I just wanted to see what everyone else thinks, because it is a well talked about topic.</p>

<p>But without the graphics you don’t have anything to look at, and without programming and graphics you have nothing but a still image. I go for anything with clean graphics at least, as long it isn’t visually horrible.</p>
