    <description>Hey Whats up Moparscape! Mattredd9395 here, 

I am looking to get into coding rsps but i don&#39;t know where to start of with a base like delta,

pi, Hyperion, all star or any other bases. I am new to coding but i would love to learn by 

starting a development team with anyone who like to learn as well or experience coders who 

will like to help build a rsps remake or just a regular rsps. i do apologize in advance if this is a 

nub thread to learn but i don&#39;t know where to start to be honest. if anyone is interested in 

learning and meeting new people to code and make a better rsps it would be great 
appreciatively :) 

Contact me Here

Skype: Mattredd9395

Thanks for your time :)</description>

You will only learn bad habits if you learn from rsps …<br>

Just because they are going to learn by example from RSPS doesn’t mean they will learn terrible concepts, have you heard of Hyperion or RuneSource?[/quote]I’m sure it’s possible no doubt look at imsuperman05 ( even though he even admits he has some flaws/bad habits now because of it ) I would still suggest they get the  basics at least down put from java docs</p>
<p>even though I do have to admit I learned about enums from rsps fairly easily <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
