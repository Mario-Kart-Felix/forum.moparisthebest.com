    <description>All in the title pretty much, although i won&#39;t accept people who don&#39;t have some sort of an application. So please leave a brief app e.g. I coded/code a successful server and am willing to help you with your issues. :D (post count will probably help :))</description>

<p>your probably a 17 year old, who has never hooked up before.<br>
As for not knowing enough java, go learn? if you have the mental capacity to do that.<br>
You pay for help with a game, not male prostitutes? thanks for the information, although it wasnt really needed.<br>
It concerns me because you are actually breaking forum rules.</p>
<p>Needy? How are we needy?</p>

<p>You’re on the Moparscape forums… Yeah nice life you must have… not condoning mine xD Where does a male prostitute come into context? and you do what you want with your money, your ‘cool life’ style will benefit from spending it on Java which in your case is so nerdy because apparently I don’t have a life for having some Java knowledge. /winx2</p>
