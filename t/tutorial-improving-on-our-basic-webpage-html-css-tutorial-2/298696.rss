    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tutorial-improving-on-our-basic-webpage-html-css-tutorial-2/298696</link>
    <description>If you did not read the last tutorial the link is http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,394871.0.html

Ok so building on from my last tutorial here is what we will add to our new layout:


[ul][li]Images and borders[/li]
[li]background images[/li][/ul]

[sup]In the next tutorial i will focus on the navigation ;)[/sup]

So currently we should have 2 files (style.css and index.html) and they both should look like this
[sub]index.html[/sub]
[code]
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;home&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link href=&quot;style.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;Site Name&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt;Test  |  LOl  |  shit&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;news&quot;&gt;Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#39;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;[/code]

[sub]style.css[/sub]
[code]body {
	text-align: center;
}
#wrapper {
	margin-left: auto;
	margin-right: auto;
	width: 800px;
	text-align: left;
}
#banner {
	width: 800px;
	height: 70px;
	text-align: center;
	float: left;
	background-color: #ccc;
}
#navigation {
	width: 800px;
	height: 25px;
	text-align: left;
	float: left;
	background-color: purple;
}
#news {
	margin-top: 3px;
	width: 200px;
	height: 599px;
	background-color: green;
	float: left;
	margin-right: 3px;
}
#content {
	margin-top: 3px;
	width: 597px;
	height: 599px;
	background-color: blue;
	float: left;
	}[/code]
	
First of all we are going to add a background to our web page. Its pretty simple to do the image im going to use is [IMG]http://i31.tinypic.com/2i71o8y.jpg[/img]

So first we open our style.css and in our current body style add
[code]background-image: url(image path);[/code]
In our case it will be
[code]background-image: url(background.jpg);[/code]
[IMG]http://i26.tinypic.com/2s9u3pv.jpg[/img]

Now our background is sorted out its time to start on the header. What we are going to do is remove the background and add a nice image. My image will be
[IMG]http://i30.tinypic.com/2hx7msy.png[/img]
[sup]Its dimensions are 400px (width) by 70px (height)[/sup]
So im going to open our style.css and remove the background from it so you need to remove
[code]	background-color: #ccc;[/code]
It should not look like this
[IMG]http://i29.tinypic.com/zilh5s.jpg[/img]
Now save our style.css and open up index.html and edit the banner to add your new image (basic html) so go to the banner divs and replace
[code]&lt;div id=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;Site Name&lt;/div&gt;[/code]
With
[code]&lt;div id=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;image url&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;[/code]
This is what mine looks like
[code]&lt;div id=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;banner.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;[/code]
[IMG]http://i30.tinypic.com/2qvaa2u.jpg[/img]
 
Now our background and banner have been improved here is what our page will now look like.
[IMG]http://i31.tinypic.com/10psoow.jpg[/img]

Now that is done its time to fix the navigation up a little (not a lot because im going to do another tutorial for that). So what we are going to do is add a border and change its background color to match the banner. So open up your style.css and change the background to match the color. Im going to use #d8e6f8 with a border color of a blackish gray ( #2f2f2f ) so we replace the background color with #d8e6f8 and add the following lines for the border:
[code]	border-style: solid;
	border-width: 1px;
	border-color: #2f2f2f;[/code]
Now you have added that our navigation div you need to reduce the width by 2px and height by 2px to keep it 800px width and 25px high. Now you have done that it should look something like this (depending on the colors you used).
[IMG]http://i31.tinypic.com/wk1nv8.jpg[/img]

Now our navigation is looking better we need to make the news and content sections better so what we are going to do to them is add borders, change the background colors and fix the padding on them. So open up style.css and add this to the bottom of your news div
[code]
	border-style: solid;
	border-width: 1px;
	border-color: #2f2f2f;
[/code]
Now we need to change the color of this. I change mine to #f1f4ff so replace the background color with this
[code]	background-color: #f1f4ff;[/code]
And you now need to reduce the width and height like before to 198px (width) by 597px (height). Your news div should now look like this
[IMG]http://i29.tinypic.com/54j7k5.jpg[/img]
Now our news div is done we only have to fix up the content div so we really just do what we did to the news div (reduce its size by 2px add a border and change background.) I&#39;m not really going to go into detail on this one so i will just add the finished div
[code]#content {
	margin-top: 3px;
	width: 595px;
	height: 597px;
	background-color: #f1f4ff;
	float: left;
	border-style: solid;
	border-width: 1px;
	border-color: #2f2f2f;
	}[/code]
Now this is what your site should be looking like currently
[IMG]http://i25.tinypic.com/xe4lqs.jpg[/img]

I have decided i will do 3 more tutorials. 1 for navigation, 1 for the news section and the other for the content section. I will also try and include asp in with it if i get that far in learning it.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>[quote=“WebProNews”]When building web sites, ASP and PHP are very popular languages. Here’s my opinion on whether ASP or PHP is best.</p>
<p>Both ASP and PHP are languages used to build Dynamic Web sites that can interact with Databases and exchange information. ASP (Active Server Pages) is from Microsoft and is used with IIS (Internet Information Server) that runs on Microsoft Servers. PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is from Rasmus Lerdorf, who originally designed this parsing language which was later modified by different people. It runs on Unix and Linux servers and it also has an NT server version.</p>
<p>There are a lot of differences between ASP and PHP.</p>
<p>Cost</p>
<p>To run ASP programs one needs IIS installed on a Windows platform server, which is not free. PHP programs run on Linux, which is free. Even the connectivity of the database is expensive in the case of ASP as MS-SQL is a product of Microsoft that needs to be purchased. PHP generally uses MySQL, which is freely available.</p>
<p>Speed</p>
<p>If we compare the speed of ASP and PHP then PHP has an upper hand. PHP code runs faster than ASP. ASP is built on COM based architecture, which is an overhead for the server whereas PHP code runs in its own memory space.</p>
<p>Platform Compatibility</p>
<p>PHP programs can run on various platforms like Linux, Unix, Windows and Solaris whereas ASP is mainly associated with Windows platforms. However, ASP can run on a Linux platform with ASP-Apache installed on the server.</p>
<p>Additional Costs</p>
<p>Many of the tools used in PHP are free of cost and since PHP is open source a lot of code can be found in open source forums. PHP has inbuilt features like ftp, email from a web page or even encryption mechanisms but in ASP such features are not built in and some additional components are required. Therefore an additional cost is incurred for such components.</p>
<p>Base Language</p>
<p>PHP is based on C++ language and the syntax used in PHP is quite similar to C/C++. C/C++ is still considered the best programming language by many programmers and people who love this language would surely feel more comfortable with the syntax of PHP. ASP on the other hand has a more Visual Basic kind of syntax that again is closely related to only Microsoft products. So, it depends on a person-to-person which language he or she is comfortable</p>
<p>Database Connectivity</p>
<p>PHP, being extremely flexible, can connect to various databases, the most popular being MySQL. ASP mainly uses MS-SQL.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Both languages have their advantages specific to users. Some would argue that both the languages have their own importance and depending on the user’s requirements the language and the platform can be chosen. If we talk about developing a discussion board then ASP is equally capable but many feel the best discussion boards are developed in PHP. If a user is looking for some e-commerce application development then many would call ASP the ideal choice. This does not mean that PHP cannot provide e-commerce solutions, only that many people choose ASP.</p>
<p>From my perspective, PHP is an all around better choice than ASP.[/quote]<br>
Got that from <a href="http://www.webpronews.com/expertarticles/2005/12/22/asp-vs-php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.webpronews.com/expertarticles/2005/12/22/asp-vs-php</a></p>

	}</code></p>
<p>First of all we are going to add a background to our web page. Its pretty simple to do the image im going to use is <img src="http://i31.tinypic.com/2i71o8y.jpg" alt width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>So first we open our style.css and in our current body style add</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">background-image: url(image path);</code></pre>
<p>In our case it will be</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">background-image: url(background.jpg);</code></pre>
<p><img src="http://i26.tinypic.com/2s9u3pv.jpg" alt width="393" height="68"></p>
<p>Now our background is sorted out its time to start on the header. What we are going to do is remove the background and add a nice image. My image will be<br>
<img src="http://i30.tinypic.com/2hx7msy.png" alt width="400" height="70"><br>
[sup]Its dimensions are 400px (width) by 70px (height)[/sup]<br>
So im going to open our style.css and remove the background from it so you need to remove</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	background-color: #ccc;</code></pre>
<p>It should not look like this<br>
<img src="http://i29.tinypic.com/zilh5s.jpg" alt width="259" height="81"><br>
Now save our style.css and open up index.html and edit the banner to add your new image (basic html) so go to the banner divs and replace</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;div id="banner"&gt;Site Name&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>With</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;div id="banner"&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;&lt;img src="image url" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This is what mine looks like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;div id="banner"&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;&lt;img src="banner.png" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p><img src="http://i30.tinypic.com/2qvaa2u.jpg" alt width="649" height="21"></p>
<p>Now our background and banner have been improved here is what our page will now look like.<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i31.tinypic.com/10psoow.jpg" title="10psoow.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i31.tinypic.com/10psoow.jpg" alt width="690" height="229"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">10psoow.jpg</span><span class="informations">847×282</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Now that is done its time to fix the navigation up a little (not a lot because im going to do another tutorial for that). So what we are going to do is add a border and change its background color to match the banner. So open up your style.css and change the background to match the color. Im going to use <span class="hashtag">#d8e6f8</span> with a border color of a blackish gray ( <span class="hashtag">#2f2f2f</span> ) so we replace the background color with <span class="hashtag">#d8e6f8</span> and add the following lines for the border:</p>
<p><code>	border-style: solid;
	border-width: 1px;
	border-color: #2f2f2f;</code><br>
Now you have added that our navigation div you need to reduce the width by 2px and height by 2px to keep it 800px width and 25px high. Now you have done that it should look something like this (depending on the colors you used).<br>
<img src="http://i31.tinypic.com/wk1nv8.jpg" alt width="301" height="173"></p>
<p>Now our navigation is looking better we need to make the news and content sections better so what we are going to do to them is add borders, change the background colors and fix the padding on them. So open up style.css and add this to the bottom of your news div</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	border-style: solid;
	border-width: 1px;
	border-color: #2f2f2f;</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to change the color of this. I change mine to <span class="hashtag">#f1f4ff</span> so replace the background color with this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	background-color: #f1f4ff;</code></pre>
<p>And you now need to reduce the width and height like before to 198px (width) by 597px (height). Your news div should now look like this<br>
<img src="http://i29.tinypic.com/54j7k5.jpg" alt width="324" height="187"><br>
Now our news div is done we only have to fix up the content div so we really just do what we did to the news div (reduce its size by 2px add a border and change background.) I’m not really going to go into detail on this one so i will just add the finished div</p>
<p><code>#content {
	margin-top: 3px;
	width: 595px;
	height: 597px;
	background-color: #f1f4ff;
	float: left;
	border-style: solid;
	border-width: 1px;
	border-color: #2f2f2f;
	}</code><br>
Now this is what your site should be looking like currently<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i25.tinypic.com/xe4lqs.jpg" title="xe4lqs.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i25.tinypic.com/xe4lqs.jpg" alt width="596" height="500"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">xe4lqs.jpg</span><span class="informations">850×713</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>I have decided i will do 3 more tutorials. 1 for navigation, 1 for the news section and the other for the content section. I will also try and include asp in with it if i get that far in learning it.</p>
