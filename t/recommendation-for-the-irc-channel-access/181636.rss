    <title>Recommendation for the IRC channel Access</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/recommendation-for-the-irc-channel-access/181636</link>
    <description>For the last week just about every day.  Actually it might be more then a week, i can not join #mopar until i have been in #moparscape or other channels and get a anouther person with access to un ban me.

This guy names KoC seems to re-ban me every day while i am not in the channel.

This person talkes greatly about RaW and how i should work with him isntead of against him.  He also refuse to acknowledge all the evidence i have collected in the past.

A few people int the irc channel say his real name is Silver Lining.  We don&#39;t know thou.
(12:52:38) Cowie`: stork: KoC == Silver Lining

Contributors to cheating or p-servers need protection from the channel staff.  Some way of stopping the staff from banning people that should not be banned.

I am in the channel right now i see Greeny, tedjohntj has @.

Silbasoft gets a %

Yet these people do not:
exemplar, regex, Ollie, and myself.

At the very least some protections from the channel staff from banning without a valid reason.

This is not the first time this has happened, it has happened many times however i am usually the target.  I hae reported this to this board before also.</description>

<p>You can tell if someone is mature by the way they act. Not by giving them a test.</p>

              <p>I do not need or want access to moderate anything on these forums or irc channel. I don’t talk there because I have nothing to say, and/or don’t want to partake in all this “drama” about access. Seriously, who cares who has a pretty little symbol next to their name? As long as the channel isn’t getting spammed or botnetted, why must there be someone considered “superior”?</p>
<p>Not a huge amount of talk goes on in <span class="hashtag">#aryan</span>, as anyone who is in there can confirm, but they’ll also confirm we don’t have any ops. I don’t even really talk there either. We’re just a bunch of people that still hang around because we’re all … bonded? I guess that would be the word … from a common past interest, and they’re all a bunch of pretty cool people too (yes, even Mopman! :O)</p>
<p>I do take a passing interest and usually read a log or two if anything catches my eye, but I really don’t spend enough of my time staring at a channel (where most users aren’t even in my timezone anyway), that to be quite frank, isn’t all that captivating and really useful at all for other than minor amusement or if someone old I once knew pops their head in.</p>
<p>… I forget what my point was going to be.</p>
<p>Between work and living with my girlfriend, there’s not really much time for anything else I want though, really. Oh, I did start writing up some random design notes for a new rscd the other day on scrap paper at work. Probably the millionth time I’ve done this, but I really would like something to come out of this crap one day, heh, I’m almost feeling very sentimental about all the rsc times <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>So, I gave KoC’s hop back. Big fuckin’ deal. He had it taken away while there was a situation goin’ on with ruler, the situation passed, I felt he could have it back without playing silly buggers. I was wrong, so I took it away again. These things happen.</p>
<p>For the most part, things in the IRC are a lot quieter and smoother than they were, say, 6 months ago. If you have any suggestions for things that should be done to maintain this “enjoyable environment” I’ll listen… if you have any suggestions for staff other than “omgz me I made a colour clicker in JAVAzzzz wut did dat guy make <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> :(: (” then I’m sure that would be well recieved too.</p>

No, that just means they are inclined to be unfair. Moderators are there to maintain an enjoyable environment for everybody else, not be informed on cheating or whatever.

Sure, CCs may not be active, but that position doesn’t entail any kind of work; operating a channel does.</p>

I mean, I only spent around a day or two in there to see just how inactive it is. Playing Kamu like a fiddle was fun, but seeing just one or two lines of text in a day was the real highlight of my visit; such engaging conversation.<br>
I had to change the topic for him to realise that it was me.</p>
<p>That’s why Kamu has +R set now. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Mind you, he couldn’t even figure that part out on his own - it took a trip to <span class="hashtag">#support</span>.</p>

Instead of complaining about not having something, you’d be best off trying to sell yourself - why should you have it?</p>
<p>Anyway, why should eXemplar have it? Sure, he’s a Community Member among other things. He also played his part in aryan.<br>
Neither of these are selling points when he rarely utters a word in the channel. He’s too elite for <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>, so naturally he conserves his energy for <span class="hashtag">#aryan</span>. The same can be said for pd and company.</p>
<p>Ollie? I haven’t really seen him in the channels much.</p>
<p>Regecks has only just been unbanned from the forums; granting him any special ability so quickly would completely undermine the idea that you receive some sort of punishment if you do something wrong.</p>
<p>As for you, don’t you have your own community to run? I don’t think it’s wise to give someone power here when they’ve got their own community to take care of, especially one the size of yours.<br>
It’s nothing personal, but there’d certainly be a conflict of interests.</p>
<p>Oh, and I added various people (from different timezones) to the access list because I don’t go on much as of late.<br>
I simply haven’t had the time nor the will.</p>
