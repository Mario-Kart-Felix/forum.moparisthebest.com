    <title>Update</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/update/539645</link>
    <description>I believe it&#39;s safe to say that we all have an &quot;IRL&quot;. (yes, that includes you Not_a_bot)

I also believe that it&#39;s fair to say that this project has been an extremely slow paced project. There isn&#39;t one person you can &quot;blame&quot; because it&#39;s a &quot;community project&quot;. I won&#39;t bother to go into detail on why this community is the way it is. The fact of the matter is, MoparClassic presented an opportunity to take the scene and put it in the correct hands (Moparisthebest) There are certain individuals who don&#39;t agree with that but at the end of the day, it&#39;s the right thing to do. Moparisthebest/Travis is perfectly capable of hosting a long term server and has previous successful administrative experience.  

I have been working privately on MoparClassic off and on over the recent holidays and I do have a tight schedule. So here is the update.

[b]New Website[/b] 

[ol][li]Post pictures and videos.[/li]
[li]Organize Events &amp; Clans[/li]
[li]Buy, Sell, Trade on Forum[/li]
[li]Adventure Log[/li]
[li]Full customization[/li]
[li]Easy to moderate[/li][/ol]


I am still working on the bestiary page, as well as npc drop rates.

[b]Inflation[/b]
I have been working out the figures on how to properly keep the economy tough. I have been slowly pacing out npc drops. A lot of the data hasn&#39;t been improved much since RSCAngel.

[b]Client[/b]
I changed the 202 client to load .rscd files. I have a background issue if anyone wants to help me out with it :)


Anyways, if you&#39;re interested in helping. Pm me for my skype.</description>

              <p>I wish you guys good luck, and if you ever get this server up i will play for sure.</p>
<p>Regarding that Inflation, it is hard to avoid, as it is a feature which is built in runescape. That is because the total amount of money in the game keeps increasing over time. Many servers lower the NPC drop rate, but this does not solve the problem, it just slows down the effect.</p>
<p>So in order to keep economy stable, you have to figure a way to get money out of the system too. Jagex tried with implementing Dwarf cannon, which costed 750k. That didnt work though. I’d suggest something that really interests players, for example, a Party Hat shop <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Well nice to see there is some progress. Don’t think anyone is still waiting on this but do your thing I guess. I probably won’t be playing since it’s low xp replica and im not confident you will keep this up long term but who knows.</p>
