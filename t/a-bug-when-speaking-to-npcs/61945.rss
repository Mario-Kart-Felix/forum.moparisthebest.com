    <description>if i try to do something that involves speaking to an npc, it works fine however

if you speak to the npc and he is to say for example

&quot;hi
do you want to go to the training grounds&quot;

and then i click to continue to go onto the next screen, it just says please wait and does nothing.

does anybody know how to fix this? please  :)</description>
