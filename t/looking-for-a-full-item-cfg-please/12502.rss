    <title>Looking for a FULL Item.cfg please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-full-item-cfg-please/12502</link>
    <description>If anyone has a fully filled item.cfg file, please PM me so I can get it.

I would prefer that such an item.cfg would have almost every item there is (up to and/or beyond 7599, which I think is a noted burnt lobster).</description>

              <p>i didnt, YOU did. and stop trying to make me look bad just because you made a mistake. admit it like a mature person.<br>
also, swearing doesnt make you look cool or smart. in fact, it only makes you look like one of the many morally depraved people of the world.<br>
PS<br>
You dont want to look like one of them<br>
Thank you for admitting that, and i hope you will be more mature from now on and realize when someone is not trying to make you look bad. I was just trying to let Marik know, as he started this.</p>
