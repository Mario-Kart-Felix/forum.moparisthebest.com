    <description>I&#39;m wondering were the correct pos Nomad should be i can&#39;t seem to find any thing of telling and hoping someone knows are even a good place for him to go. Also i&#39;ve been working on him and i seem to unable to fix him from hitting 0s i&#39;ve changed the def and att stuff in the spawn-config thinking that would work and nope. So if anyone could help me that would be GREAT! Thanks! :cool:</description>
