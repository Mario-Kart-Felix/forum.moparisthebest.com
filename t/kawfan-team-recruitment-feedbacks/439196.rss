    <title>KAWFAN - Team recruitment / Feedbacks!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/kawfan-team-recruitment-feedbacks/439196</link>
    <description>Heya,

So yeah, instead of just editing the Exion sources, i decided to make it a new RSPS.  :)
Since i had my 2 years webhosting, i was thinking &quot;why not take advantage of this webhost &amp; make something of it&quot;..

[b]Website:[/b] *
[i](not advertising, just giving a preview for feedbacks)[/i]

[u]Webclient side:[/u]
The webclient is out and working. (beta version)

[u]Website site:[/u]
I&#39;ve uploaded a SMF forum software, but i dont really think i&#39;ll keep it.
I was thinking about making simple PHP pages, and code a basic PHP Forum.

So yeah, if you want to get in this project i&#39;ll be happy to get some help.
Or just post your Feedbacks.  :D
Also, I was thinking to release a official version when I reach 300-500 registered members on the forums.
[i]I think this is a good idea because it&#39;s useless to put the official version at the beginning..[/i]

this is why i want feedbacks, I want to know if I should use something else than SMF, etc..
but also, i want to keep it really simple, for me it looks more professional..
I dont want something big.
