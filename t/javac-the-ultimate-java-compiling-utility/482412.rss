This tool can be used to compile packaged applications without the need to specify every directory within the application to be invoked from the command-line (command-line compiler, Win batch files, etc. for those of you who do _not_ use an IDE.)

What this means is that if you don&#39;t like to use an integrated development environment (IDE) and you prefer the old-school command-line initialization and compiling, this tool is definitively for you, simply because if you download a server that has been repackaged and it does not come with a compiler ready for you, you can implement this tool with a few easy steps.

Say you were programming Hyperion, and you did not wish to use an IDE, and you&#39;re using javac++, this is what your batch file would look like:

[code=batch]
java -jar javac++.jar src lib bin
pause[/code]

There are three parameters that you need to figure out. 

1. Where the source is (the .java files, usually named &quot;src&quot;)
2. If you have any dependencies (libraries, usually named &quot;dep&quot;, &quot;deps&quot;, &quot;lib&quot; or &quot;libs&quot;) 
3. And finally the output directory. (usually named &quot;bin&quot; or &quot;build&quot;)

Another thing is that you do _not_ need to specify your directory to your jdk, which is sometimes frustrating I can imagine.

Some of you who know about setting the environmental variables know that this can be done much more simple, but not everyone knows how / cares to do so. The only thing I take credit for is decompiling his older version and making it compatible with jdk-6 and jdk-7 and for re-uploading it (all of his posts were removed from Rune-Server and he account was removed here.)

If you have any further questions feel free to ask on this thread. :-)
