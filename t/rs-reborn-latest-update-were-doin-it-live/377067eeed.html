<p>Because it doesn‚Äôt matter how incredible the design of your server is, or how many cool systems you implemented. No one will play your server because your scripting system is better than someone else‚Äôs; they play for content.</p>
<p>We aren‚Äôt doing this strictly to test ourselves like you seem to be doing; we are making a server that emulates RuneScape, like most other people here.</p>

When you actually write something that‚Äôs half-way decent or better than the things that are released you don‚Äôt want every half-wit to have it. It‚Äôs a very simple idea really‚Ä¶ Why would you a mostly undeserving community a fully completed server that they‚Äôre just going to host and make no edits to. Then if there are issues they have to overcome by themselves they claim your release is total bull shit.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs what I got done. Also I plan to finish it eventually, but now I can actually do the type of scripting I want to <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Well, this isn‚Äôt really the place to release this‚Ä¶ As it pretty much has absolutely nothing to do with us since there‚Äôs not content on it whatsoever.</p>

<p>Still don‚Äôt get why people are so obsessive over content‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Because it doesn‚Äôt matter how incredible the design of your server is, or how many cool systems you implemented. No one will play your server because your scripting system is better than someone else‚Äôs; they play for content.</p>
<p>We aren‚Äôt doing this strictly to test ourselves like you seem to be doing; we are making a server that emulates RuneScape, like most other people here.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You could have done both, but you guys were more concerned with remaking things people have done over and over again.[/quote]</p>
<p>Nobody has been close to emulating runescape yet, so no‚Ä¶we are implementing content that hasn‚Äôt been done. The correct term is ‚Äúare‚Äù, not ‚Äúwere‚Äù we still exist and we still care more about content. We want a high performance server that emulates RuneScape. Why do I need some sort of insane funky abstract Item system when the one I have works 100% perfect and is technically more efficient.</p>
<p>Our framework has too many ‚Äòfancy‚Äô systems as it is. Far more than most servers. They cause more overhead and never actually increase the speed of programming.</p>

        <p>Scully and the team obviously had intentions of making an efficient RuneScape Remake, not a core that runs with 1% CPU usage. So what if their way is not the top best, so long as it works and isn‚Äôt a complete memory leak/dead lock, who cares.</p>

Haha and you are the kind of person that thinks your highly complex, polymorphic systems are better than everyone elses just because it isn't basic. Once again, K.I.S.S.

LOL, thanks for the laugh. We're not out paying people for help or begging people and that type of shit. We're perfectly capable of doing this ourselves, and doing it right.

<p>Your entire team had no idea what the palette system was, I had to explain how it worked and why I was doing it. WOW we are getting back to systems! I have never heard you use that word before, damn your vocabulary is expanding.

<p>I think you misunderstood, that‚Äôs my fault. What I meant by polymorphic systems is the highly abstract systems you create. I‚Äôm not saying the whole idea of OOP is stupid, I encourage the use of OOP but there is a becomes a point where it‚Äôs just too much and it seems like you don‚Äôt know how much is too much.</p>

No, you shouldn't have said anything at all. Now you not only are a retard, but you look like one. You better watch out for your superior reputation since everyone here loves you so much right? - Oh and don't forget the ladies.

<p>Load data from text file &lt; Load data from class file and load class file onto run time. Your team is just a bunch of lazy fucks who don‚Äôt have any patience.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">It took you [b]3[/b] days to understand that we weren't doing a 317. That must be an idea that is a little [i]too[/i] innovative for the likes of you.</code></pre>
<p>Then right after I figured out we were doing 414 I renamed 40% of the classes in the client in a short span of time, your point is?</p>

<p>The entire idea of our server is special, creative, <span class="bbcode-b">and</span> innovative. As I said before, my systems will out perform yours and be done in half the time. Player‚Äôs aren‚Äôt going to play your server because you spent a month designing and diagramming every single system you make; they will play mine because its better.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Your entire team had no idea what the palette system was, I had to explain how it worked and why I was doing it. WOW we are getting back to systems! I have never heard you use that word before, damn your vocabulary is expanding. Also you guys couldn‚Äôt even comprehend how I could possibly have used Rhino to script most of the server; this is what I like to call incompetence. We didn‚Äôt even get to my grand idea of using Lua as a scripting agent, oh damn I was looking forward to that.</p>

<p>I should have used the word incompetent.</p>
<p>A little note on Polymorphic Systems:</p>
<p>Why call it a system, Polymorphic is a computer science term for the process of a root object being used for different higher tasks. Its always better to use a Polymorphic OOP <span class="bbcode-b">MODEL</span>, systems are sets of processes that do something i.e. Item System. Go back to school or get a book before you act like you know what you are talking about.</p>
<p>Keep It Simple Stupid</p>
<p>In my mind is using a low level OOP model, sorry people don‚Äôt find that simple but that‚Äôs how I roll.</p>
<p>In conclusion;</p>
<p>This project is a lie.<br>

<p>Oh for the love of God.</p>
<p>You renamed the class <span class="bbcode-b">names</span> and it took you multiple days.</p>
<ol>
<li>Holy shit I can look at a 317 and realize that it‚Äôs the exact same naming.</li>
<li>Why? You just wasted time. You have no priorities.</li>
</ol>
<p>You are well recognized for doing nothing, and only on locus; nobody has ever heard of you anywhere else. The things you have released have never been used. Your attempts to do anything are completely futile.</p>
<p>You just completely made up the idea of Rhino and Lua; you didn‚Äôt mention either of these a single time. You wanted to use Javascript.</p>
<p>If you are going to argue to prove your intelligence, don‚Äôt lie about it man.</p>
<p>[quote]I should have used the word incompetent.<br>
[/quote]<br>
No, you shouldn‚Äôt have said anything at all. Now you not only are a retard, but you look like one. You better watch out for your superior reputation since everyone here loves you so much right? - Oh and don‚Äôt forget the ladies.</p>
<p>Going to ask for this thread to be cleaned, you have done nothing but waste our time and prove your ignorance.[/quote]</p>
<p>Last time I checked Rhino was Javascript <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/</a>, talk about ignorance huh? Although I admit I did not say we were going to use Lua mainly because I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to; but now I have a plan.<br>
I am not well known? Oh damn I will just have to try harder‚Ä¶</p>
<p>What have you accomplished, in your time of being in RSPS that you have publicly released? Wait to add onto this, that is actually worth mentioning?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/client-2.html">@Client</a> Argument</p>
<p>317 client and 414 client are very similar, the cache system was the only thing I found different (so far). Strange but true fact children.</p>
