    <description>ive been looking at some timers and when i tried to add one in my client the timer doesnt do anything... it seems to stay at the number i set it on. i copied &quot;logoutdelay&quot; and made a new timer out of it but like i said it didnt work. can someone explain how i would make one?

---EDIT---
