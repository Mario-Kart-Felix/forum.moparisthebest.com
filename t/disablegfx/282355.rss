    <description>[center][b]DisableGFX v1.0[/b][/center]

This is a little application that I put together that disables the rendering methods in the client.  When I say &quot;disables&quot; I simply mean that it gives you, the user, the ability to disable and enable the client graphics at will.  Think of it as a switch of sorts, turning the graphics on and off.

This is more of a proof of concept than full fledged application.  I have not included a loader for it, however I will give all the information that you need to do so yourself, and perhaps when I have more time I&#39;ll bung something together quick to load it up and allow you to disable and enable them.  However, anyone who would find this application of any use to them should be able to do it themselves.

[b]Output:[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;DisableGFX will disable the rendering methods in the client
Author: The Bank

Loading class files :
- Loaded 310 class files

Injecting conditonal field and accessors :
- Injected boolean field: gfxEnabled
- Injected accessor: getGfxEnabled()
- Injected accessor: setGfxEnabled()

Searching for Animable class :
- Found Animable class: nh
- Found render method: a

Patching rendering in client :
- Patched rendering in method: f.a
- Patched rendering in method: ri.a
- Patched rendering in method: ia.a
- Patched rendering in method: hc.a
- Patched rendering in method: fe.a

Dumping Client :
- Client dumped to: runescape_out.jar

DONE!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b]Information:[/b]

This is any information you will need to create something to load the edited runescape jar.

DisableGFX injects 2 methods and 1 field into the &quot;client&quot; class.
[code]static boolean getGfxEnabled() - returns whether the client graphics are currently enabled
static void setGfxEnabled(boolean enabled) - sets the gfxEnabled field to the value of enabled
static boolean gfxEnabled - the field that controls the state of graphics[/code]

Once it finds the render method, it will find all instances of the method in the client (there appears to be 5 in all the latest revisions) and edit them so the start of the method will appear as such:
[code]if(!client.gfxEnabled)
	return;[/code]

Also, depending on how you want to access the methods and field that were injected, the &quot;client&quot; class now also implements &quot;net.bot.hooks.Client&quot;, but that could be easily changed with a quick source code edit.

[b]Final Notes:[/b]

This is, in no way shape or form, tested.  It is a [i]proof of concept[/i] and [i]should[/i] work, however if it doesn&#39;t please tell me the result of which and I will be more than happy to make a new version of it.

You can choose two distributions, the binary code in a JAR format, or the source code as a RAR.  If you choose the JAR, you have two choices, you can run it from the command-line or terminal to see the output of the program, or just double-click the jar and wait for &quot;runescape_out.jar&quot; to appear.  The jar can be renamed as you wish after being generated.

[b]runescape.jar MUST be present in the same directory as the JAR![/b]

<p>Also, currently, you can interact with the client while the graphics are disabled, and the memory usage is noticeably lower, however having said that, there are more methods I could target.  There are other methods in the “drawing3DBuffer” class which would reduce even more CPU usage, however doing so would make you lose your ability to interact with the client.  In the way I do it, you maintain control of the client, while reducing CPU and memory usage.</p>
