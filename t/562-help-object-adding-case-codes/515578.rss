    <title>[562] [Help] Object adding - Case codes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-help-object-adding-case-codes/515578</link>
    <description>Hello,
On my server, I have the smithing skill fully working, besides furnaces not working. Any furnace I tried to use in runescape simply said &#39; object not added &#39;. So anyway, I got the furnace Id, added where I wanted it. Now I get not error like before. But they simply do not work. I have narrowed it down to that I need to add a case code for the furnace(s) to work. I know the case codes are all in my Object1PacketHandler.

I just do not know what code to add exactly, Can any of you guys help?

Thanks in advance.</description>
