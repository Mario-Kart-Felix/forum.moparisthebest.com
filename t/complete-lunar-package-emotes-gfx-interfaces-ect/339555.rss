I was collecting this and doing everything hard coded, but then realized that was dumb, so i gave up.

If you don&#39;t know how to add these, then you don&#39;t deserve this.

You need to:

Gzip models, rename the model id under 15000 (unless preloading)

Add configs in ect....

<p><span class="mention">@You</span>, I didn’t reply to your PM because I know you would have just leeched it.  I’m not fucking stupid, and BTW, anyone can go on runescape and grab emotes, then go into RSMV and grab models for the Animations…</p>
<p>It isn’t impossible…Also, I do have skillcape emotes.  Don’t hate cause you can’t get what you want.  If you worked hard at creating stuff, which over half this community lacks, you would be able to say you did something cool.  Would you release knowing that over 50% of a community of 100,000’s is just waiting so they can leech it and take credit?  No, you wouldn’t but others would, why?  I have no idea, I tried being nice at first but you wouldn’t accept it…Since you wont, fine, but next time don’t flame someone for posting back on something others already have…You posting this was like as if you reposted dragon claws models.  so… [size=36pt]GTFO OR STOP FLAMING[/size][/quote]</p>
<p>I’m sure you do have skill cape emotes thats why you failed to show me and SilentCJ you had them?</p>
<p>LOL splitting them into 2 files? Are you retarded? No you have no idea whats so ever how to do it, me and CJ asked you simple questions, and you couldn’t answer.</p>
<p>Please I dare you to take 3-4 hours searching for models, animations, and GFX’s. I dare you.</p>
<p>Please learn some grammar before you speak again. Thanks</p>
