    <description>Hey guys

I have a quick question, when doing barrows on my server (you actually have to do it like in real RS, digging and killing 5 of them, then go into the tunnel) you get disconnected when going into the tunnel. Does anybody know how I can fix that? Thanks in advance.</description>

<p>Take a picture of the run.bat of your server when it disconnects you, i’d like to see what it says.</p>

              <p>Soulsplit (317) also had this problem, which is an earlier version of P.I.</p>
<p>It’s disconnecting when you reach the tunnel which leads underground? When exactly is it disconnecting? Also take a screenshot of the error it throws. If It’s the exact same problem as Soulsplit, then it will give an error.</p>
