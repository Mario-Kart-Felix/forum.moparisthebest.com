<p>There is nothing in the client, there is no password harvesting going on, and everything is 100% legitimate.</p>
<p>Please show me exactly what you are basing this nonsense on, because I’d like to see this “password stealer” seeing as I am hosting it.</p>
<p>An excellent program to scan what a program is doing is ‘wireshark.’ It shows all network connections and will clearly show that nothing is going on.</p>
<p>If you have other programs that can see what it’s doing, feel free to use them. Decompile it even!</p>
<p>This is nothing more than a baseless and underhanded shot against my server because a few people are pissed off over something I don’t even know about. Show me one piece of evidence that shows one thing is going on with hydrascape that isn’t legitimate and I will shut the entire site and server down right now.</p>
<p>All I want is ONE PIECE OF EVIDENCE that backs up your announcement that is destroying my server.</p>
<p>If you can’t provide me that, I don’t see why that announcement is up.</p>
<p>I’ll keep an eye on this thread and answer any questions until the announcement is deleted.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 17, 2008, 03:53:13 pm[/size][hr]Oh look at that, no one can provide ONE SINGLE BIT OF PROOF…</p>

You sir have failed. Why would a Moderator just decide to post about Hydracape in the Announcements? Obviosuly theres a reason.[/quote]</p>
<p>If there is a reason, it is unknown to me. It is silly to think that a person I have never heard of knows more about my server than I do, when I HOST IT.</p>
<p>All I am asking for is that reason, and no one can provide it to me. I have seen the client inside and out, I know the staff well, and I know how everything works within my community. There is nothing going on, but somehow when some moderator here makes a comment with no proof, everything stops?</p>
<p>How would you like it if you spent months making a server that is 100% legitimate and someone came along and made an outright lie claiming your server is unsafe? It’s pretty damn frustrating.</p>
<p>Adding to the frustration, no one has a single shred of proof that something is going on, and yet the announcement stays up?</p>

        <p>Also in moparscape if we are in a download section and someone says ‘omg virus’, there is a 90% chance everyone will freak and say the same shit. It is also the same with ‘omfg leech’ when they DONT HAVE A CLUE if it is or not. They just want to be in the ‘in’ crowd. Also i never seen mopman or w-e hes called lie before. Thug lies so theres a difference lol</p>

<p>Exactly, just because someone claims something is unsafe does not mean its unsafe. We recently had to ban close to twenty users for duping, perhaps someone who was banned is just angry at us and is friends with mopman? In that case, I would have to call mopman on abusing his staff position. This baseless announcement is going to kill my server and over absolutely no proof aside from the word of a moderator that doesn’t even play my server.</p>
<p>Show me the proof or delete the announcement, is that so much to ask?</p>

<p>If you want the proof that my client is clean, decompile it, scan it with a network monitor, or whatever else you want. Show me the proof and I will SHUT THE SITE DOWN.</p>

<p>I am not sure why Mopman made that post, as it seems unethical to put a server in an announcement, perhaps you would like to send me your framework’s source and I will look through it and try to see what Mopman is going on about. (I wouldn’t worry about me stealing your source). Next time I see Mopman I’ll inquire him about it.<br>

<p>I’d be happy to, I will zip it and send it to you shortly.[/quote]<br>
Thank you, I will look at it when I get home from school, but I appreciate you not arguing and accusing me of stealing your source. Until then, read this - <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,237059.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,237059.0.html</a>, join IRC and talk to Mopman.</p>

        <p>Rofl i am rolling both ways… you DO know why i highlighted the ‘hydrascape client.exe’ part? Is there even a file name called that? Does the run.bat even run that? Why hasn’t anyone posted this yet? Why is it .exe? Cause this is a FAKE picture i made. Well not fake but i used one of my tools and renamed it to ‘hydrascape client’ Shows how idiotic and easy faked pictures can be made.
