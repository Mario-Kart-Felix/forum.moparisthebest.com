    <title>About the announcement for Hydrascape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/about-the-announcement-for-hydrascape/231650</link>
    <description>I own and host Hydrascape and all I have to say is what the hell?

There is nothing in the client, there is no password harvesting going on, and everything is 100% legitimate.

Please show me exactly what you are basing this nonsense on, because I&#39;d like to see this &quot;password stealer&quot; seeing as I am hosting it.

An excellent program to scan what a program is doing is &#39;wireshark.&#39; It shows all network connections and will clearly show that nothing is going on.

If you have other programs that can see what it&#39;s doing, feel free to use them. Decompile it even!

This is nothing more than a baseless and underhanded shot against my server because a few people are pissed off over something I don&#39;t even know about. Show me one piece of evidence that shows one thing is going on with hydrascape that isn&#39;t legitimate and I will shut the entire site and server down right now.

All I want is ONE PIECE OF EVIDENCE that backs up your announcement that is destroying my server.

If you can&#39;t provide me that, I don&#39;t see why that announcement is up.

I&#39;ll keep an eye on this thread and answer any questions until the announcement is deleted.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 17, 2008, 03:53:13 pm[/size][hr]Oh look at that, no one can provide ONE SINGLE BIT OF PROOF...</description>

<p>I am not sure why Mopman made that post, as it seems unethical to put a server in an announcement, perhaps you would like to send me your framework’s source and I will look through it and try to see what Mopman is going on about. (I wouldn’t worry about me stealing your source). Next time I see Mopman I’ll inquire him about it.<br>

Thank you, I will look at it when I get home from school, but I appreciate you not arguing and accusing me of stealing your source. Until then, read this - <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,237059.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,237059.0.html</a>, join IRC and talk to Mopman.</p>

<p>You sir have failed. Why would a Moderator just decide to post about Hydracape in the Announcements? Obviosuly theres a reason.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>If there is a reason, it is unknown to me. It is silly to think that a person I have never heard of knows more about my server than I do, when I HOST IT.</p>
<p>All I am asking for is that reason, and no one can provide it to me. I have seen the client inside and out, I know the staff well, and I know how everything works within my community. There is nothing going on, but somehow when some moderator here makes a comment with no proof, everything stops?</p>
<p>How would you like it if you spent months making a server that is 100% legitimate and someone came along and made an outright lie claiming your server is unsafe? It’s pretty damn frustrating.</p>
<p>Adding to the frustration, no one has a single shred of proof that something is going on, and yet the announcement stays up?[/quote]<br>

You sir have failed. Why would a Moderator just decide to post about Hydracape in the Announcements? Obviosuly theres a reason.[/quote]</p>
<p>If there is a reason, it is unknown to me. It is silly to think that a person I have never heard of knows more about my server than I do, when I HOST IT.</p>
<p>All I am asking for is that reason, and no one can provide it to me. I have seen the client inside and out, I know the staff well, and I know how everything works within my community. There is nothing going on, but somehow when some moderator here makes a comment with no proof, everything stops?</p>
<p>How would you like it if you spent months making a server that is 100% legitimate and someone came along and made an outright lie claiming your server is unsafe? It’s pretty damn frustrating.</p>
<p>Adding to the frustration, no one has a single shred of proof that something is going on, and yet the announcement stays up?</p>
