Grow plants or something.

I had a really weird urge to grow plants yesterday and I still have it today so I want to carry through with it. Odd because I&#39;m like the opposite of a vegetarian.

Anyways. I&#39;m pretty much going towards sunflowers I think. I was talking to my friend at school and he said he used to have them and explained quite a bit about them.

I&#39;m open to suggestions though.

It&#39;s pretty cold right now where I live so I&#39;d probably grow them in my room or in my spare room.

How much do you think it&#39;d cost for a few plants (maybe start out with two sunflowers?) to get everything set up?

Any tips from anyone who actually does this stuff?</description>

              <p>I remember growing a tray of grass, I dont know why I just went down to mums greenhouse and got a tray and started growing grass. After a few good weeks it was going really strong I lost it and found out my mum had put it in to the lawn to repair it, I then spent further weeks taking care of it and I think it’s still growing strong to this day.</p>

And if you really like this stuff, click my ads. That’s what paid for this starting stuff actually &gt;_&gt;</p>

              <p>Ok we went shopping today and I got everything I need locally here at Home Depot after checking out the prices at a few other place.</p>
<p>I even got the seeds here cause the online retailer sells their seeds to Home Depot.</p>
<p>I spent a lot less than expected. $41.</p>
<p>This got me:</p>
<p>5 seed packets. (Elf Sunflowers, Teddy Bear Sunflowers, Tropical Mix Sunflowers, Sweet Banana Peppers, and some other flower I forgot the technical name of)<br>
2 Light 4ft Fluorescent strip.<br>
2 40W 6500k color temp bulbs.<br>
64 quart bin.<br>
32 quarts of soil.</p>
<p>For like $7 they had a 12" pot for plants and with the spacing requirements that would mean two plants max probably.<br>
For $9 they had a 64 quart bin, the giant tupperware container things for like laundry and misc shit. Yeah well it’s about as tall as the pot and a lot longer and wider.<br>
So I got that instead. I put the top underneath it and drilled holes in it and viola, a drainage system also.</p>
<p>The lamp runs like 5" off each side if I place it right one top. Until the plants are each like 3" tall I can basically put the lamp on top of the box, and then to keep most of it in I can put a huge sheet of foil on top of the box. After that I need to find a way to raise it slowly. The chains that came with it are only 6" long. I’m thinking about finding a way to fasten it to my camera tripod because I’ve got two of those in here.</p>
<p>I took a few of each seed and started germinating them so within two weeks I should have some ready to plant.</p>

<p>My friend has grown these and he first tried by windows and the cold killed his.<br>
Then he moved them to his small greenhouse and they grew pretty well.</p>
<p>The only places I can find any information about lighting requirements in terms of wattage and lumens are weed forums. But it’s helpful nonetheless because it gives me an idea of what I need.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a bunch of people using a 2 bulb 4ft strip FL light and grow a few plants underneath but they’re all fairly small plants compared to what I’ll be growing.</p>
<p>Looking into this more I found CFLs to be cheaper than FLs because I’m spending most my money on the strip for the bulbs with those, and CFLs I only need a wall socket adapter.</p>
<p>But looking into it EVEN MORE I found I can actually spend a lot less money on FL tubes and get a lot more light out of them.</p>
<p>I had a few setups in mind. 4x23W CFLs or 2X40W CFLs.</p>
<p>I could either get four clamp lights or two with a Y adapter so they’d house four lamps total.<br>
That price came out at about $40-$50 either way, ordering online or buying in store. I can get it cheaper online but the shipping cost makes it exactly the same as in store.</p>
<p>Either of those would give me 5.5-6.5k lumens. Almost perfect considering the plant will be tall and a lot of falloff is expected.</p>
<p>However, I found a nice cheap FL tube housing which fits two 4ft tubes, the T12 kind. Well I also found T12 4ft 40W tubes on sale and in packages of two. I can get two of these strips and two sets of two bulbs for less than $30, and my lumen output will be over 12k. That’s not bad at all, even though they’re T12. The T8s and T5s are much more efficient but cost a LOT more than this.</p>
<p>It also works out because I can have them slightly vertical instead of horizontal and get two sides of the plant lit from above. I could probably throw in some small plants next to it as well and they’d thrive off of the lights.</p>
<p>The only problem is I’d need to make or find something to attach the lights to. And make my own reflectors</p>
<p>And if I’m really considering doing this with more plants later on, there’s a T8 pre-fashioned 4ft 4 tube 32W each setup less than $50 and with a lumen output just a little higher. Though I think I’ll stick to what I said right before this one.</p>

<p>Any search I do with lumens and plants pops out a shitload of weed growing forums.<br>
But they all say different things. 2k lumens per sqft or 5k lumens per sqft.</p>
<p>For one sunflower I’m guessing it’ll need a lot of light because it’s a full sun flower but not THAT much yaknow?</p>
<p>I’ll pick up a CFL 40W+ that’s higher than 5500K temperature-wise which gives me at least 2k lumens to play with on that one, and I have another CFL which I don’t think is that much but it can be a secondary light for now.</p>

<p>About the ones you mentioned. You mean CFL? Compact fluorescents? I’ve got one, but I use it for photography.</p>
<p>The ones I’ve looked at online specifically for growing, are like 100W. And the same amount of money basically. But I’d need more than one.</p>
<p>And all the other ones like max out at like 30W. Same as like a 100W+ incandescent. But speaking in that, you’d need like 30 80W incandescent lights to grow a normal plant I read somewhere.</p>

Ok FUCK Metal Halide lights.</p>
<p>Apparently lights like that only work with a ballast, basically something that regulates the current.<br>
Well the lights are pretty cheap but those ballasts are like a fucking hundred dollars for the shittiest one.</p>
<p>Guess I’m looking into a lot of fluorescents.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 22, 2009, 10:14:30 pm[/size][hr]</p>
<p>Ok.<br>
2ft 24W Entire range FL tube is 2000 lumens. I was going to get two of these maybe. 4000 lumens.<br>
250W metal halide light is about 20000 lumens. Basically five times that.<br>
CFL 40W is 2600 lumens. More than one 2ft 24W tube?</p>
<p>Doesn’t make much sense to me. But it seems the cheapest route is the CFLs. About $40 from a plant specialty store with a clamp and plug.</p>
<p>I’ll inspect Home Depot’s CFLs and see if they output near as much.</p>
<p>I wish I knew how many lumens a sunflower wants =[</p>

Sunflowers and corn are my final choices I think. Found a site that specializes in lighting and looked up some prices on some lights. I think I’ll go with Metal Halides cause they’re effective and for less than $20 I can get a 400W one, which is great for a 3sqft area which should be all I’ll need for a while. later I might get some fluorescents to supplement it.</p>
<p>That was just for pricing basically.</p>
<p>Now I need to look into pots and soils.<br>

<p>I’d hate to pay the electricity bill for a 400W lamp.  I’d use florescent lights if you have to, but you should be able to just put them by the window.[/quote]</p>
<p>The windows are cold around here, I don’t think it’d be warm enough. Even so, I’d have to move it to fall into the sunlight wouldn’t I? My dogs would be like WTF IS THIS SHIT.</p>
<p>I think everything just got a lot easier. My mom has a pretty big pot she wants to throw the plant out of so I can use that pot. She also has soil.</p>
<p>Now, I just need to get the light and the seeds. I think I’ll order the seeds tomorrow once I research each of the ones I’ve narrowed it down to specifically and find a nice starting one.<br>
This weekend I’ll go looking around at Home Depot etc and see if they have any kind of lights fitting to my needs.</p>
<p>I would use fluorescent lights but I’d need at least two really high output ones or four decent ones. I was looking at prices on those and I would pay a lot more immediately to get those than to get the one MH light. Plus, one of these little lights has equal the output of ten 54W 4ft FL tubes. I’m not looking to getting that many =/</p>
<p>EDIT: Don’t take any of that seriously. I forgot I wasn’t getting the 400W MH. I was getting the 250W.</p>

<p>Well I think for now I’d keep them inside. It JUST started getting really cold here (lows are 15) so it’d be a while before the last frost.<br>
By time these are completely finished, I think it’d be a little past that, so the next ones I’d probably plant outside.</p>
