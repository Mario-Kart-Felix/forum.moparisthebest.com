    <description>hi there for now i am just gona post the basics of what the server will be. sorry mods if i am posting without permision please tell me if i am. 



Tlpkscape this is a new project. Based Devo v2.4 i need serios java programers that are willing to build a good economy server not shitty server. If you would like to join please post ur emails here or private message me for your contac info.



[ul][b]what will the server have?[/b]
[list][li]We will try to build a good pvp system(Devo has it just need to edit a little bit more). 99%[/li]
[li]New PVNPC system. 80%[/li]
[li]better minigames. 0%[/li]
[li]Jad waves. 20%[/li]
[li]Quest(at least 10). 0%[/li]

[li]fishing.100% (thanks to killmess)[/li]
[li]firemaking. 100% (thanks to killmess)[/li]
[/list]

[b]Update #1 06/03/09.[/b]
PVP: i&#39;ve added more special attacks to the weapons. Barrows are doing there special effect. 
Minigames. I been thinking about a minigame using Casel Wars it will be like my clan wars. I started adding the combat in CW am gona try to finish it by this week.
this is all i did today i am try to add vids and stuff like that.

[b]Update #2 06/05/09.[/b]
client: I got my webclient working it connects to the server.
server:almost done with the new minigame. Started to work with the PVNPC it&#39;s a little complicated since killmess did not add the magic againts NPC&#39;s so this is gona take me a while to add. Othere than that pretty much it. I am still looking for java programmers.

about this:


[quote=&quot;v3nom&quot;]george dont lie to yourself.. david was your coder and he quit, and everyone remembers what happened last time you started doing things on your own, you were running the server into the ground, the vps going down just finished it before you could.
Im not being mean here but its the truth and when you get a new plan to get everything running again, then maybe you can tell us your doing updates.
Because i havent seen anything lately that shows your trying to update everything.[/quote]

people he does not know what his talking about. David was my programer he did not even know how to program he was my webmaster. I was the one who coded the server want to talk to david to see if he was my programmer? add him his email is davilardi@hotmail.com go ahead add him ask him who program tlpkscape. If you don&#39;t know whats going on don&#39;t come talk shit to me please.</description>

The rule is clear as day, you cannot post a development team without moderator approval.
