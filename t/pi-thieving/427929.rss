    <description>Hello everyone,
How I set it up so far is. You need a ticket to thieve a stall, you but tickets from shop.
When You have tickets in you&#39;re inventory and click a stall, it takes away one ticket and you theive one time.
I want to make it soo, you can only buy i certain amount of tickets per day.
I don&#39;t know how to go about this though, I think it has something to do with this,

&lt;blockquote&gt;case 239:
				c.getShops().openShop(78);
			break;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
