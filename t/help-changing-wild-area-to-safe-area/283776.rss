    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-changing-wild-area-to-safe-area/283776</link>
    <description>I was coding my own source when i noticed that all the areas i wanted were &quot;Wild&quot; areas. I was wondering if any knew how and could explain it to me so i can finish my source. I think this would help many other people also. so help if you can and thanks. Guardianman5</description>
