          <blockquote>
              <p>The function getLastLogin takes a parameter of the Client class.  As RandQm said, you can call public methods from the Client object inside of that method now.  This is called referencing an object.</p>
<p>You pass a reference to an object into the method so you can use the data/methods/etc. from that object.  “c” is the name you would refer to the object as when you’re inside of the method.</p>

              <p>[quote=“RandQm, post:2, topic:526560”]It refers to your Client object.<br>
Code going from the client object can be called inside the method now.<br>
That why you see c. before some code.<br>
But you could put Client dlzefnguaenguer if you would want, you just would have to put that row before any code<br>
you want to call from the Client object.<br>
So for organization they put c or client lowercase[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh thanks</p>
