    <title>667 Wildy is broken..? Rep</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-wildy-is-broken-rep/449312</link>
    <description>I&#39;m pretty sure that before I started working on the source it had wilderness working.. But then since that I&#39;ve done alot of updates to do with different things such as clanwars etc and I never went to the wildy so I didn&#39;t know that it wasn&#39;t working.. 

When you go into the wildy you can only see the normal options on other people like follow, trade, req assist but no attack :\

Does anybody know how I could fix it or has anyone else had this problem before and fixed it? Am I missing a method or something? :\

Thanks any help appreciated I&#39;ll rep+ you :)</description>
