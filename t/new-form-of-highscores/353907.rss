    <title>New form of highscores</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-form-of-highscores/353907</link>
    <description>Well, a development I made  :rolleyes:

I&#39;ve always hated it how the highscores are in-game.
So, I thought, &quot;What if i made them out of all around characters- and not connected to MySQL?&quot;.

That&#39;s just what i did today ;)

[size=14pt]Features:[/size]

[ul][li]Has top10 ranks from all characters, offline &amp; online.[/li]
[li]Loads mostly the same way as before, but instead from a text file.[/li]
[li]The text file is updated, the person of that rank is moved down, and the last person is kicked off of the list.[/li]
[li]100% Accurate, set up to reload every time a player levels, logs out, logs in (in-case of DC), or disconnects.[/li]
[li]Important: Doesn&#39;t lag, one bit  :eek:[/li][/ul]

Ill post pics soon.

P.S. Post your opinion on this, please no flaming, and please tell me if i should make a TuT on this :)</description>

<p>Yes.  It would be much faster to load from a database.</p>
