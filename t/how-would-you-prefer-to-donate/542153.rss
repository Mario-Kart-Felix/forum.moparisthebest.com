    <title>How would you prefer to &quot;Donate&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-you-prefer-to-donate/542153</link>
    <description>Most rsps owners will depend on payments (or &quot;donations&quot;) from players keep themselves afloat. However, the typical server will have one of the following:
1) You send money to the owners paypal, then the owner gives you the item.
2) You&#39;re presented with a few items and can pick from the list, and then get the item from the owner.
3) Same scenario as 2, but there&#39;s an auto donation system in play.

However, there is also the system like ikov has. Where you purchase a fixed amount of tokens and then purchase the items with said tokens. Runescape uses the same idea for solomons.

What do you guys think? Do you think that token-based shops are better than paying for the item(s) alone?</description>

              <p>It depends on what you’re going for. If you want a lot of money, microtransactions for another type of currency are the way to go. People are more likely to spend money if the things they are buying do not have an exact dollar amount linked to them. For example someone is much more likely to buy a partyhat if you sell it for 1000 tokens rather than 10.00 dollars, even if 1000 tokens costs about 10 dollars. That said, my personal opinion has been that anything you can buy with real money shouldn’t have a significant impact on the game. Unfortunately this isnt the best way to make money so people dont do it. But if I was going to spend money it would be purely cosmetic.</p>

Yes, but people paid money for tokens. I doubt they would have low value in game. If a guy was say 100 tokens off an item, they most likely would either donate or trade something of high value in game to make up for the tokens. Either way it benefits you and players.</p>

              <p>Most rsps owners will depend on payments (or “donations”) from players keep themselves afloat. However, the typical server will have one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>You send money to the owners paypal, then the owner gives you the item.</li>
<li>You’re presented with a few items and can pick from the list, and then get the item from the owner.</li>
<li>Same scenario as 2, but there’s an auto donation system in play.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, there is also the system like ikov has. Where you purchase a fixed amount of tokens and then purchase the items with said tokens. Runescape uses the same idea for solomons.</p>
<p>What do you guys think? Do you think that token-based shops are better than paying for the item(s) alone?</p>
