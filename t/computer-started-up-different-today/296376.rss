    <title>Computer started up different today...?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/computer-started-up-different-today/296376</link>
    <description>Normally my computer will go straight to the account decision, but today the screen went black and a box that said something about WINDOWS/command.com repeatedly popped up. It probably opened about 10+. I shut down my computer, and then I got to the account decision. After I logged on, the same thing happened but it said a frame.dll or a file near that could not be found. I restarted one more time, and this time I logged in successfully. The box however kept opening up until my msn opened aswell.

I am not sure what went wrong. The only thing I can imagine is from yesterday. The SpyBot Search &amp; Destroy program which wanted to run the next time the computer started so it could delete some PUPs. I am running a virus scan just incase. Does anyone have any ideas what went/is wrong?</description>

You like graphics, music, and browsing the internets (and nothing else)?<br>
Go Mac.</p>
<p>You like programming/servers?<br>
Go Linux.</p>
<p>You like doing a wide variety of things and playing games?<br>
Go Windows.</p>
<p>Or be like me and have all three on different computers… My mac is a little old however so I don’t use it all too much.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>3 different computers?  Because you can’t have them all (or at least two) on the same computer?  Linux will run beside anything.[/quote]</p>
<p>You can, but why mix anything with a Mac?</p>
<p>Linux+Windows is fine but I’d rather have them separately if possible.</p>

I mean dont get my wrong osx is great for surfting the web/checking your email. But for most people knew to computers it can be a bit overwhelming, and now with the release of windows 7 which I like very much it may be a bit hard to keep up. I dont see why everyone complains about viruses. Honestly if you cant use a windows computer with decent anti-vrius software and not get a virus you shouldnt be using a computer at all. I think ive only every had 3 viruses and that was on old operating systems, even then I could remove them and everything would be just fine.</p>

<p>Obviously you’re changing the subject because you cannot come up with a valid reason as to why you think Windows is better than Linux. Just because you suck at everything, including operating systems doesn’t mean the OS sucks.</p>

If windows is so much better than linux then why is it used on most web servers. And dell sells linux PC’s.</p>
