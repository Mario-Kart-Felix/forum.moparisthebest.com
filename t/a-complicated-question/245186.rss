    <description>Alright, this may be hard for some to know because it sonds to me like it would be hard to do. How can you make NPCs remotely attack each other? Like when one sees the other or when there next to each other they start to attack each other. I am using DDSspec as my source if that makes any difference. Thanks![br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 19, 2008, 01:06:08 pm[/size][hr]Anyone? Heh heh</description>
