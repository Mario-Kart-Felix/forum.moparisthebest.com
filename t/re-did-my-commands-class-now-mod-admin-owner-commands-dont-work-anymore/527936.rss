    <description>Hello MoparScape,

Last night i decided to give my Commands system a little make over and re-do every command i had.
When i whas done i whas gonna test my commands and i found out that all my Player commands (Playerrights 0) works perfectly, also my Donator commands (isDonator) works good.
So when im trying to do a Mod/Admin/Owner command it just doesnt work.
Also the yell system dont work.
And when i do ::mute without a name it says: The player must be offline.
If i do ::mute remco
IT doesnt mute him, just does nothing.

So here is a copy of my Commands class i made

http://pastebin.com/um4dGDpW

Can someone help me out here? That would be very awesome.

And the Donator commands work again but i think thats because of<br>
c.isDonator &gt;= 1</p>
<p>Not sure what the problem is…</p>

              <p>Did you test the commands for regular players on an account having playerRights == 0?<br>
As Sessy Pk3er already stated you don’t have an <code>if(c.playerRights &gt;= 0)</code> and have an <code>if(c.playerRights &gt;= 1)</code> twice.</p>
<p>I haven’t yet noticed why your Mod/Admin/Owner commands wouldn’t be working.<br>
Try adding some debug messages in between the “If’s/cases” and see where exactly it goes wrong.</p>

</aside>
<p>That bit is normal.</p>
<p>as your command without a name would be “mute” which is 4 chars and you try to substring 5 in your code (the normal extra space after mute when you do insert a name).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>When catching this error it’ll throw you</p>

<p>OT: the only margin for error that I noticed is the 2 instances where you use <code> if (c.playerRights &gt;= 1) {
		switch (playerCommand) { </code></p>
<p>This confused me as you never declared any commands where <code> (c.playerRights == 0)
</code> yet you claim that those undeclared conditions work.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
