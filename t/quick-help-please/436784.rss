    <description>On my server when you first log in the chat color is by default pink, and if you go into the settings tab there is a button that says: chat effects and it is on by default. When you press the off button it will be yellow which i want to be the default value. I looked in the files of my server and found one area (in client.java) where I think controls the chat effects. I found the section bellow. I was thinking that there was going to be a boolean that i would simply have to change to false as default but, it says chatTextColor = inStream.readUnsignedByteS(); and i do not understand what this means or how it works, could someone please tell me how to make it so chatcolor is by default yellow and chat effects button is default set to off?

[code]			case 4:			// regular chat
				chatTextEffects = inStream.readUnsignedByteS();
				chatTextColor = inStream.readUnsignedByteS();
				chatTextSize = (byte)(packetSize-2);
                                if(muted == 1) {
                                sendMessage(&quot;You can&#39;t talk because you are muted!&quot;);
                                }
                                else if(muted == 0) {
				inStream.readBytes_reverseA(chatText, chatTextSize, 0);
				chatTextUpdateRequired = true;
                                }
	
				break;
