    <title>Dont use bot anymore!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dont-use-bot-anymore/87921</link>
    <description>RuneScape can easily detect your bots now, and the way they can is by:
Once someone report your bot, there detection machine will look into your account records then ban you...
Its all explained in [url=http://news.runescape.com/newsitem.ws?id=785]the update[/url], so this would be like. You could easily get banned even if you let your bot rest!
&amp;
For the fan websites...boy have bots really done it this time. Jagex wont go after the bots now, but after the fan website who host black market items and such. As quoted below, heres my proof:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We can (and do) ban them - including using [b]IP bans[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

IP Ban! That would mess you up from playing the game! You dont wont this...

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]We currently ban about 8000 accounts every week[/b] for trying this sort of cheating, and for a long time that kept things under control.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

8000 a week! Thats a lot of bots  :eek:. You bette hope there not you next...&gt;.&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]
This is why we are now further increasing our efforts.[/b]
So how to stop it? The answer is clearly to [b]tackle the black market[/b]. As long as there is the potential to make money, they won&#39;t stop trying, even though it damages the game for everyone else. Of course, if nobody spent real world money on RuneScape gold these unwelcome groups would just switch to a different game.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 I&#39;m guessing you see the problem in this one...

&lt;blockquote&gt;Finally, we have noticed some 3rd party sites, which call themselves &#39;fan sites&#39;, but then [b]advertise black market trading sites[/b]. This will no longer be tolerated. By running such advertising [b]these sites are directly supporting these gangs[/b], and are thus [b]causing the botting problems they then complain about[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
All you fan sites..boy you better unpack your things. Even if you weren&#39;t guilty you still would have to shut it down soz.

[i][i]And now you see why you shouldnt use bots.[/i][/i]</description>

I’m sure you have all heard of a Proxy right?<br>
A proxy is something you download onto you’re computer from any website (reccomend <a href="http://download.com" rel="nofollow noopener">download.com</a>, it’s the safest site). Now proxies have the power to change you’re Ip, Rofl copter, you’re sorted?</p>
<p>so just download proxies if you get banned  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>All the 8000 accounts they ban and are detected are all those lvl 3 defauly players in lumbrage chopping yews.  They are used with a java bot and are very detectabe; and people do report them.  As for scar, you can go forever without getting banned.  All you need to do is auto on a character with a high combat like 40, only auto for 30-1 hour at a time on each char and let them rotate, and don’t leave them with no armor and bad stuff.  It is RSdemon that is ruining runescape, not us.  We even help jagex ban the RSDemon users with stuff like <a href="http://www.srl-forums.com/forum/botcatcher-t10137.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">THIS</a>.  And when you transfer stuff from one player to another, never trade it for nothing, always throw in some runes or something bad so it won’t eb suspicious.</p>

<p>EDIT:<br>
Well, if your going to use a bot, I’d suggest making it seem like he’s muted, by making it use emotes to talk lolz. That would be undetectable bot proof there.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>As recently discussed from a friend of mind who let me barrow things- Credit goes to <span class="bbcode-b">Agnome</span> on RS2 (ty mate!):</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Agnome</span> says…</p>

As you can see on the front page, <span class="bbcode-b">jagex is now cracking down on rule 12</span> ( real world item trading )</p>
<p>While i understand the need to do this ( as extensivly explained on the update page ), i have a question with this.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How can you tell ?</span> (<span class="bbcode-i">You can discuss this one here…</span>)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Jagex says they can detect “suspicious” trades.</span> (but is it true they can?)</p>
<p>Whats suspicious?</p>
<p>I used to trade my partyhat to a friend(which is me…) all the time, let him keep it for a while, and then he gave it back to me.</p>
<p>Is this a suspicious trade ?<br>
How do you know its not breaking rule 12 ?</p>
<p>What if i let him have it for a week, am i getting banned then ?<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">What if a friend quits and gives me a large amount of gold or items ?</span> (possible this could happen…)</p>
<p>I had a friend who got banned(not me &gt;.&gt;…), because he helped someone sell his christmas cracker ( in game, for RS gold ) so his friend gave him 20 mill as a thank you.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Next week, he got banned for RL item trading.</span> <em>lol!</em></p>
<p>I have had a friend loan me 16 mill cash(that was me), when i wanted to buy my first partyhat, and i payed him back a month later (no he payed me half of it :@, how solo ay?).<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Now, i would be scared to try that, because Jagex will assume it RL trading.</span> <em>I agree, I would to</em></p>
<p>Jagex, i respect the need to crack down on this, as its an obvious problem.<br>
But tell me:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">How are you going to protect all the inocent people that will inevetibly get caught up in your witchhunt</span> ? (yeh jagex…how?)<br>

<span class="bbcode-b">they can see and track</span> but<span class="bbcode-b"></span> i <span class="bbcode-b">dont think they will tell</span>.<br>
for exemple you talk to your friend more then once.<br>
greetings dhyan h</blockquote></h2>
<p>good point<br>
still, how long do you have to be talking to someone, until they arent suspicious ?<br>
I agree… Jagex will have a hard time in that, so it will mainly be like this:</p>
<p>In order to not get banned for real life item trade, dont give free money! Because jagex update there trade system.</p>

              <p>RuneScape can easily detect your bots now, and the way they can is by:<br>
Once someone report your bot, there detection machine will look into your account records then ban you…<br>
Its all explained in <a href="http://news.runescape.com/newsitem.ws?id=785" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">the update</a>, so this would be like. You could easily get banned even if you let your bot rest!<br>
&amp;<br>
For the fan websites…boy have bots really done it this time. Jagex wont go after the bots now, but after the fan website who host black market items and such. As quoted below, heres my proof:</p>
<blockquote>We can (and do) ban them - including using [b]IP bans[/b]</blockquote>
<p>IP Ban! That would mess you up from playing the game! You dont wont this…</p>
<blockquote>[b]We currently ban about 8000 accounts every week[/b] for trying this sort of cheating, and for a long time that kept things under control.</blockquote>
<p>8000 a week! Thats a lot of bots  :eek:. You bette hope there not you next…&gt;.&gt;</p>
<blockquote>[b]
This is why we are now further increasing our efforts.[/b]
So how to stop it? The answer is clearly to [b]tackle the black market[/b]. As long as there is the potential to make money, they won't stop trying, even though it damages the game for everyone else. Of course, if nobody spent real world money on RuneScape gold these unwelcome groups would just switch to a different game.</blockquote>
 I'm guessing you see the problem in this one...
<blockquote>Finally, we have noticed some 3rd party sites, which call themselves 'fan sites', but then [b]advertise black market trading sites[/b]. This will no longer be tolerated. By running such advertising [b]these sites are directly supporting these gangs[/b], and are thus [b]causing the botting problems they then complain about[/b]</blockquote>
All you fan sites..boy you better unpack your things. Even if you weren't guilty you still would have to shut it down soz.
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-i">And now you see why you shouldnt use bots.</span></span></p>
