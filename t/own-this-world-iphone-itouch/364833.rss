    <description>Apple appstore link: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/own-this-world/id344905169?mt=8

I&#39;ve been playing this for the last month it&#39;s awesome. Description below.


&lt;blockquote&gt;Description
Want to rule the world? There&#39;s an app for that!

Back in the good old days explorers would roam the world and claim land on behalf of their nation. These days everything is taken. No longer! We&#39;ve decided the world is free for the taking again.

Own This World is a geo dependent online game (GDOG) that allows you to take over territory based on your current location. Your rank in the world climbs as you claim territories. If you have the most you are crowned the ruler of the World.

Owning territories allows you to accumulate resources (gold, manpower, food &amp; supplies) which in turn allows you to attack other users in your current territory. 

Compete against the entire world or buy your own personal world for you and your friends.

Create or join an Alliance so you can your friends can take on the world together.

View the state of the world at www.ownthisworld.com

-------------------------------------------

WHAT OUR USERS ARE SAYING:

&quot;This is an incredible idea and is one of the few apps I&#39;ve downloaded that changes how I go about my day to day routine. My wife loves to use it while we&#39;re driving. She enjoys sending us on alternate (or &quot;scenic&quot; routes) just to take territories from people. This application has made hitting a red light or a wall of traffic a positive thing, and there aren&#39;t many apps out there that can pull that off. There&#39;s something about taking a territory from a friend that is simply exhilarating. The amount of backstabbing that&#39;s gone on in my office over the day has been hilarious and there are already talks of road trips just to build up scores.&quot;

&quot;I had a dream about this app last night. I dreamt that I walked all the way around the great wall of China, just to gain the territory.&quot;

&quot;This is a great and very original app. It makes me want to ride my bike down the street just to get a new territory!&quot;

-------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:

-Regional Leaderboards: 
Having trouble taking over the entire world? Now you can narrow it down a bit with regional leaderboards. If your region isn&#39;t listed, please email support@bnid.ca and we will add it to the list.

-Alliances:
Now you can take on the world with your posse! Your nightly production of resources is shared amongst those in your alliance, so you can share your wealth or get a little help from your friends. Territories owned by alliances will be indicated by the alliance color as well. Watch your climb to world domination with the alliance leader board.

-In-game Messaging
Have you been dying to chat with some of the people you&#39;ve been playing with? Now you can. Just add them to your friends list, and start chatting.

-No-Purchases World
You asked for it, we&#39;ve given it to you. Don&#39;t like that people can blow money and stock up on resources. Then play in a purchase free world. Just select &quot;Earth - No Purchases&quot; in the world selection screen.

-New look and feel
We&#39;ve tightened somethings up, moved some things around, and added more features!

-Twitter integration
Brag to your friends and followers about your status in OTW, do a little trash talking, or just tweet it with a local # to get more players in your area.

-------------------------------------------

*NOTES: 

- Users location will be less accurate when playing on an iPod touch as it has no GPS to calculate the location, instead using other means provided by Apple.

- An 3G or internet connection is required to play Own This World.

- Location services must be turned on to play Own This World.

- iPod Touch Users: Your IP address must be registered with Apple or you&#39;ll show up in the ocean. http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/29/apple-location/

<p>The client determines the timer, I wonder if they have any safegaurds for the timer being modified to go faster…</p>
<p>Has anybody got the ability to play around with it, try to speed up the timer or attempt to spam the packet the timer sends? I would have a look, but my work computer is too restrictive.</p>

<p>-No-Purchases World<br>
You asked for it, we’ve given it to you. Don’t like that people can blow money and stock up on resources. Then play in a purchase free world. Just select “Earth - No Purchases” in the world selection screen.</p>
<p>-New look and feel<br>
We’ve tightened somethings up, moved some things around, and added more features!</p>
<p>-Twitter integration<br>
Brag to your friends and followers about your status in OTW, do a little trash talking, or just tweet it with a local # to get more players in your area.</p>
