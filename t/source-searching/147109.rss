    <description>Hi guys,

I&#39;m looking for decent source. I&#39;ve been using Testscape, but I can&#39;t seem to be able to add objects and get NPCdrops to work and stuff, even after posting on this forums several times in the past requesting advice and help with the coding (to no avail). 

So what I want is a source that already has the objects place thing sorted. Also, working woodcutting, special attacks would be a bonus. 

Although if someone could be as kind as to download a source and do these things for me, That would be great. 

Thanks in advance,

Syrillia.</description>
