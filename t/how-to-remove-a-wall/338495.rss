    <description>OK BEFORE U TRY TO ANSWER READ THIS LINE!
The wall that im trying to delete is not on a X and Y Axis, So i cant use Deleteglobalobject ####,     #####,     #,         10// An object.

the wall i am trying to delete is between absX 3094 absY 3493, and absX 3095 and absY 3493 so unless i can do deleteglobalobject      3094.5,     3093,       3,         10;
so how can i delete a wall that has no even  X and Y ?</description>
