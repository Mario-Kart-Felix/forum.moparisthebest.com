Level Up Minecraft is a fast growing bukkit server. The server started out back in Novemember last year as a Factions Server. We have since grown to an average player base of 60 during the weekdays and 100+ on weekends. We have had over 30,000 accounts log onto the server since January and making the top 70 on Minestatus including 1431 registered users on our website. We now have two servers, PvP and Survival to cater for our players interests.

We have just opened our second server to expand our name giving us the opportunity to provide our players with 2 different game types, Survival and PvP. In the near future we are also planning to release a Creative server. We are in the process of creating a cloud, enabling players to teleport between servers within our servers it self and experience the ability to change servers with a simple command in-game or walking through a portal in the &quot;Hub&quot; server.

You can visit our website at http://www.levelupmc.com
Server IP: mc.levelupmc.com

Both our Survival and PvP server is hosted in LA with a dedicated box of Dual Intel Xeon E5-2650 OCTO-CORE processors combined with 16GB DDR3-1600 ECC registered ram, two Intel 180GB 520 series ssd&#39;s backed by a LSI 9260 Raid controller with cache and a high speed internet connection giving minimal lagg anywhere around the world.

The server network has many great features for all players to enjoy.

    Survival server - which includes 8 build worlds.
    PvP Server - Factions based PvP gameplay. 4 worlds dedicated to Factions and spawn world which has sewers and other PvP arenas. Mod Arena soon to come.
    DisguiseCraft - Have the ability to turn into mobs with a simple command. When you get attacked or attack someone in a disguise, you/then will then become undisguised to remove unfair gameplay.
    mcMMO - Brings a new touch to the game, level up woodcutting, excavation, sword and many other skills. This gives you rewards while playing the basics of Minecraft.
    Stable Economy - We have managed the economy so everything on the server is affordable no more ridiculous high prices
    Donator Features - The server runs off donations only. All donations brought into the server will help expand the servers and create an even better game play.

All our moderators and Admins have been picked by myself and other admins as they shown dedication to the server, respected and helped out the players. All moderators start out as Mod Trainees and are given 2 weeks to prove that they have the ability to do moderator jobs. This is to ensure that there are minimal stuff ups to keep our players happy.

Our admins and moderating team are working around the clock to bring players a better playing experience. We do changes based off the community input, we can&#39;t make everyone happy - but we do our best to make it enjoyable for everyone.</description>
