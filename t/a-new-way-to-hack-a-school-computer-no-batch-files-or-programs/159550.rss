[ul][li]This will only work if your school uses [b]www.studyisland.com[/b] in classes, you cannot do this. And i have [b]Tested[/b] this at school, that is how i discovered it. **Note: This will work on anything, i&#39;m just using studyisland.com b/c that is how i found this and most schools use this during a computer time.
[/li][/ul]

[b]
Something to know:[/b] Everytime i get a chance i screw a computer at school, and then the next day i&#39;ll go to use the same computer and ask the teacher what is wrong with it and ask the teacher to fix it when i know how.

[b]1. [/b]Ok to start, open up your browser either log onto studyisland and start a quiz, or google something and go to images.
[b]2. [/b]Second, Just right click the image and select &quot;save as&quot; and you should have access to anything from there like i did. I was able to go into &quot;C:/&quot; and &quot; All Programs&quot; Which you cannot usually have access to, if this does not work for you, your teachers are smarter than the average teacher dumber than a donkey in &quot;US schools&quot;.

[b]If you did not understand any of this here is a picture.[/b]

[b]Credits: 50%, Me 40% My teachers for being to stupid to block this, 10% And You risking getting expelled for attempting to do this.[/b]</description>

I really don’t care anyhow, With firefox’s extensions their little web blocker is useless lol.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Sadly, they use internet explorer in our school.</p>
<p>Our school has a <span class="bbcode-b">high</span> restriction to any bad websites…Like even google images are blocked, miniclip(I know it’s useless), and couple others.</p>
<p>I highly doubt this guide will work for most since they can’t ussually access their Program Files…</p>
<p>Another way (if they have restrictions) is you can look at your internet connections and choose the one that is not the school one (if you have more than 1 internet connections obviouslly) and they probably don’t have restrictions.[/quote]</p>
<p>Just go to <a href="http://hidemylocation.com" rel="nofollow noopener">hidemylocation.com</a> it lets you go anywhere, my computer class is half the school day so I do the work that takes 5 mins then do whatever like go on myspace or mopar or anything else.</p>
<p>And once I told one of the 8th graders at my school how to do this and he started to print pr0n pics from the internet, the teacher was reading so he got away with it…untill i took the pictures and got him suspended that is.</p>

<p>There is a breakdown of my security. Most settings are locked but they dont matter due to deepfreeze.</p>

person googled proxy (they are dumb) and were called down the next day or so</p>

<p>real easy to hack. go to internet explorer and type in ‘C:’ witout the quotes. then hit enter. if you can’t access C: by doing that then your unlucky. on my school computer we had access to everything except blocked sites. i even had access to regedit and cmd. and i could use most cmd commands and change almost everything with regedit. quite fun. we could even change our de3sktop pics and themes. quite nice of them. in the library we could login with our own username and password precreated for us. but those had less freedom. we could still change our desktop and themes and stuff tho.</p>

Sadly, they use internet explorer in our school.</p>

<p>Another way (if they have restrictions) is you can look at your internet connections and choose the one that is not the school one (if you have more than 1 internet connections obviouslly) and they probably don’t have restrictions.[/quote]<br>
My schools blocks at a minimum of 70% of the stuff. You cannot edit wallpapers or anything like that. But i was able to get into that stuff with this. so i don’t know maybe your just unlucky <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
