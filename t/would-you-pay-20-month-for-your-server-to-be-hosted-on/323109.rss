    <description>Dual Intel Quadcore 5420 CPUs
12GB Ram, 2x500GB SATA Drives
Unlimited Bandwidth [100Mbit Port] 


I&#39;m possibly going to give you 10 spots (Maybe even more) starting out at 20$ a month for this server.

[b]Note: You would ONLY get server hosting, in no way would you have FTP access to any parts of the servers, nor would you have any access at all. Any updates would have to be made via your side, then give to me to upload to the server.[/b]

I am also interested, as a Mopar user and enthusiast, in providing Moparscape possibly their own spot on the server for free for their own server.</description>

<p>But you would have to run how many of these $20 servers on there to make money?  At least 10 or 15 I am sure, which would mean they would run horribly.  Also, how would you make sure each user couldn’t access another user’s data by writing the java code to read their files?  Overall it is just a really bad idea, it would be better for someone wanting a server to get their own server or VPS.</p>

<p>Yes I’m quoting the owner.  Who cares.  I dought anyone would pay so only 2 people would have servers running on his pc.  So it would be fast -_-</p>

<p>So you warned me about saying that?  1, thats dumb (no offense mod)  because if you have basic computer knowledge you can set up sharing folders than can be VPN accesses.<br>
And spam?  I’m just “asking” if people would.</p>

<p>So you have unlimited IPs you can bind to on the server?</p>
<p>What I am concerned about, is that unless you run each server under a different account, AND have permissions set up correctly.  With the right code in someone’s server they could look at, change, and even download other people’s servers, configuration, and passwords.</p>

              <p>But you would have to run how many of these $20 servers on there to make money?  At least 10 or 15 I am sure, which would mean they would run horribly.  Also, how would you make sure each user couldn’t access another user’s data by writing the java code to read their files?  Overall it is just a really bad idea, it would be better for someone wanting a server to get their own server or VPS.</p>

<p>I’m possibly going to give you 10 spots (Maybe even more) starting out at 20$ a month for this server.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note: You would ONLY get server hosting, in no way would you have FTP access to any parts of the servers, nor would you have any access at all. Any updates would have to be made via your side, then give to me to upload to the server.</span></p>
<p>I am also interested, as a Mopar user and enthusiast, in providing Moparscape possibly their own spot on the server for free for their own server.</p>
