[size=14pt][u][b]Welcome to Spades-Scape![/b][/u][/size]

Spades-Scape is a new server that Spades and Runefreak10 have been working on. It kicks a good amount of ass.

[b]Spades[/b]: Kevin
[b]Runefreak10[/b]: Bill

We&#39;ve also been getting side help from Ry60003333 (Ryan)

We are open beta at the moment. To view our open beta thread, click [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,534248.0.html]here[/url].

Our client is a 317 client loading a 377 cache (objects, npcs, maps, etc.) with imported 474 items, animations, and gfxs. We have items such as godswords, bandos, armadyl, 3rd age, dragon boots, dragon full helm, skill capes, etc. all in the old environment. We like it this way because everything remains basic and simple, but you still have a larger variety of weapons and armour to choose from. It&#39;s bomb as fuck. We also made headicons read from the cache.
[size=12pt][u][b]
Client Features:[/b][/u][/size][/center]

[ul][li]You must have a username AND a password both filled in in order to log into any server, not just ours.[/li]
[li]You get the option to change the server ip and the port underneath the username and password.[/li]
[li]Delete key quickly erases text in the username, password, and server ip fields, as well as the chatbox in-game. So if you have a long ass message typed out and you find a typo at the beginning of your message, delete key erases it all instantly.[/li]
[li]The client will not log you into the server if your username contains any invalid characters, such as ~, !, @, #, &gt;, &lt;, etc.[/li]
[li]The client will auto-capitalize the player&#39;s username; the first letter in the username, as well as any other character following a space and will auto-lowercase any unnecessary capitalizations. (looks more clean and organized this way)[/li]
[li]There are built-in commands to change the detail of the client; ::lowdetail and ::highdetail. Low detail looks pretty shitty on some objects though, as well as the fire cape. No idea why, was always perfectly okay before the client was jarred, but fuck it, shit happens.[/li]
[li]There&#39;s a Ctrl+V feature that was added. you can copy any text on your computer and paste it by pressing Ctrl+V into the chat box and it will paste in your text. Convenient as fuck.[/li]
[li]Updated the friends list, so all online friends appear at the top of the list, so no more annoying scrolling through your list to find online friends[/li][/ul]


[center][size=12pt][u][b]Recent Adds/Fixes:[/b][/u][/size][/center]

[ul][li]Fixed special attacks: there was a bug causing the game to crash when using certain special attacks on certain npcs[/li]
[li]Fixed a bug where you could stake x and trade x and when you put a zero, it would still add the item[/li]
[li]Added real-time challenging/trading: you don&#39;t challenge or trade the player until you&#39;ve ran up to them[/li]
[li]Fixed a bug where if two different people trade you, and you accept one of them, after accepting the first one and you click at the bottom of the screen to accept the second one, then decline the trade, the original player you were trading gets stuck in the trading window[/li]
[li]Fixed it so if the server is restarted while a player in in the middle of a trade, or a duel where they are staking, their items safely return back to their owners. Also fixed it so when a player has an offered item in trade or stake and that player disconnects for any reason, the items return back to them[/li]
[li]Fixed it so when a player dies, their skull is removed from above their head.[/li]
[li]Fixed a bug where if a player was at once in combat with an npc and they try to log out, their client returns them to the login screen, but their player remains online, causing them to not be able to get back on[/li]
[li]Fixed max item amount from 2,000,000,000 to 2,147,483,647[/li]
[li]Fixed the bank where it would only allow you to store up to 200 slots, now allows all bank slots[/li]
[li]Added mining: appropriate mining timers, uses Graham&#39;s cycle-based task manager[/li]
[li]Added online players list: showed the amount of players online before, now it shows the player&#39;s names[/li]
[li]Added fully working clan chat system: can create your own clan chat, join others, have people join yours, etc. (will possibly be adding a ranking system for friends)[/li][/ul]


[center][size=12pt][u][b]Features So Far:[/b][/u][/size][/center]

[ul][li]FLAWLESS player-clipped following, and I mean FLAWLESS[/li]
[li]FLAWLESS NPC clipping[/li]
[li]Efficient and organized trading system[/li]
[li]Beautiful PVP/PVM system; melee, ranging, and magic[/li]

[li]Player following while using range AND magic, while the player&#39;s running away[/li]
[li]Working defence bonus system[/li]

[li]::searchitem command[/li]
[li]Dueling arena (100% working staking, rule-toggling, and remove-item-toggling)[/li]
[li]100% successful OFFLINE IP-banning and OFFLINE Un-IP-Banning (by putting in player&#39;s name, not their ip, that&#39;d be dumb as fuck)[/li]
[li]Perfect banking system (also noting and unnoting the 474 items properly, as well as ANY items where their noted ID is NOT 1 number above their unnoted version, like dragon 2h, claws, helm of neitiznots, etc.)[/li]
[li]Perfect shopping system (Properly unnotes every single item if you sell noted items to the shops)[/li]
[li]PVP skulling system (don&#39;t lose your skull if you log out)[/li]
[li]Player and NPC freezing with magics (bind, snare, entangle, and freezing ancient spells)[/li]
[li]Player stat-reducing magics[/li]
[li]Loaded over 500 NPC animations so far, starting off with only 2[/li]

[li]Online players list[/li]
[li]Fully working clan chat system, will possibly add ranking system for friends in the future[/li][/ul]

<p>We’ve also been getting side help from Ry60003333 (Ryan)</p>
<p>We are open beta at the moment. To view our open beta thread, click <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,534248.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our client is a 317 client loading a 377 cache (objects, npcs, maps, etc.) with imported 474 items, animations, and gfxs. We have items such as godswords, bandos, armadyl, 3rd age, dragon boots, dragon full helm, skill capes, etc. all in the old environment. We like it this way because everything remains basic and simple, but you still have a larger variety of weapons and armour to choose from. It’s bomb as fuck. We also made headicons read from the cache.<br>

Client Features:</span></span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[ul][li]You must have a username AND a password both filled in in order to log into any server, not just ours.[/li]<br>
[li]You get the option to change the server ip and the port underneath the username and password.[/li]<br>
[li]Delete key quickly erases text in the username, password, and server ip fields, as well as the chatbox in-game. So if you have a long ass message typed out and you find a typo at the beginning of your message, delete key erases it all instantly.[/li]<br>
[li]The client will not log you into the server if your username contains any invalid characters, such as ~, !, @, #, &gt;, &lt;, etc.[/li]<br>
[li]The client will auto-capitalize the player’s username; the first letter in the username, as well as any other character following a space and will auto-lowercase any unnecessary capitalizations. (looks more clean and organized this way)[/li]<br>
[li]There are built-in commands to change the detail of the client; ::lowdetail and ::highdetail. Low detail looks pretty shitty on some objects though, as well as the fire cape. No idea why, was always perfectly okay before the client was jarred, but fuck it, shit happens.[/li]<br>
[li]There’s a Ctrl+V feature that was added. you can copy any text on your computer and paste it by pressing Ctrl+V into the chat box and it will paste in your text. Convenient as fuck.[/li]<br>
[li]Updated the friends list, so all online friends appear at the top of the list, so no more annoying scrolling through your list to find online friends[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[center][size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Recent Adds/Fixes:</span></span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[ul][li]Fixed special attacks: there was a bug causing the game to crash when using certain special attacks on certain npcs[/li]<br>
[li]Fixed a bug where you could stake x and trade x and when you put a zero, it would still add the item[/li]<br>
[li]Added real-time challenging/trading: you don’t challenge or trade the player until you’ve ran up to them[/li]<br>
[li]Fixed a bug where if two different people trade you, and you accept one of them, after accepting the first one and you click at the bottom of the screen to accept the second one, then decline the trade, the original player you were trading gets stuck in the trading window[/li]<br>
[li]Fixed it so if the server is restarted while a player in in the middle of a trade, or a duel where they are staking, their items safely return back to their owners. Also fixed it so when a player has an offered item in trade or stake and that player disconnects for any reason, the items return back to them[/li]<br>
[li]Fixed it so when a player dies, their skull is removed from above their head.[/li]<br>
[li]Fixed a bug where if a player was at once in combat with an npc and they try to log out, their client returns them to the login screen, but their player remains online, causing them to not be able to get back on[/li]<br>
[li]Fixed max item amount from 2,000,000,000 to 2,147,483,647[/li]<br>
[li]Fixed the bank where it would only allow you to store up to 200 slots, now allows all bank slots[/li]<br>
[li]Added mining: appropriate mining timers, uses Graham’s cycle-based task manager[/li]<br>
[li]Added online players list: showed the amount of players online before, now it shows the player’s names[/li]<br>
[li]Added fully working clan chat system: can create your own clan chat, join others, have people join yours, etc. (will possibly be adding a ranking system for friends)[/li][/ul]</p>
