    <title>Simple MP4 movie server for browser. (GIT)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simple-mp4-movie-server-for-browser-git/554800</link>
    <description>I needed to host a movie server in my house from a old desktop so that everybody didn&#39;t need to copy movies onto a thumb drive to watch them. I started off with the web-server, and now I have changed it around into a simple web-server for watching movies. It uses a simple HTML5 embed to play them.

There is one issue and that is that I had to link to another file-server to actually watch them. When uploading to GIT I was in the middle of adding a Config class and forgot to edit the MoviePage class to not link back to the other server. Its not an IP address, used in-house router address for the computer.

Github:
https://github.com/Soharuda/Movie-Server

The problem:
When linking back to the own server I can easily download the movie to other computers, which is fine but I would prefer just click and play. Currently it has to link to another file-server for the HTML5 player to actually work. When linking back to my server the file will be sent but never received by the player as far as I can tell. Not sure whats going on so I would like some help fixing that.</description>

<p>Yes the project has been actually a good deal of practice. I have been using the program as-is for a while now as a web-viewable movie server, along with downloads. I have expanded this to now be able to assign movies into a category, as well as several back-end fixes which don’t effect the user. I plan to enable POST requests later to upload a movie with MP4 extensions only. Once everything works as it stands I will start a complete re-write from the bottom up to get it so that movies can be watched via browser without needing a 3rd party file-server.</p>
<p>Still have not fixed the issue where movies can be downloaded at any time but cannot be watched if linked to my server for the HTML5 viewer. It doesn’t keep the connection going.</p>
<p>EDIT: I guess this is a good time to mention that I have been toying around with other servers to check out and see how they handle transfer of data. So far they all just use the OutputStream like I have been doing, and just writing bytes. As well as they produce the same connection issue. Will keep looking/trying things until I find one that works and then change my file-transfer to work like whatever I find.</p>

              <p>Yes, ya see when doing a program for personal use I tend to code with the same amount of fudges that I give in life. None. If it works, good. Its for personal and I couldn’t care less.</p>
<p>I could re-write this with far better methods rather than to just jumble code together like I have been doing. I would just rather get everything working before I actually start making it better. Code is simple enough as-is to do a complete re-write within a few hours.</p>
<p>EDIT: Okay in a last-ditch effort to find out whats wrong I am going to write a program to grab the response headers when requesting the same movie from my server and from the file-server and see what is going different.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Alright I suspect it is in the way that I transfer data. Will do a total re-write using another method I guess. Will do some more research in a more reliable method. I grabbed the request and response headers when grabbing movie from file-server and my movie server. Hard-coded them to match, making what needed to be entirely dynamic. Tested with same movie, and did get same header, but still did not play. Now I guess goes the time to package the classes and everything. Will be swapping the GIT for new one once I get a working product.</p>
<p>EDIT3: Well after several other methods of sending data were tried and none of them working correctly I am going to abandon this project as it in its current state. It works fine when accompanied with a second file-server which does support ranges. Just been using this as a front-end for the website side of things and a 3rd party file-server for actually grabbing movies to watch them.</p>

<p>Will look into this now. Thanks.</p>
<p>Okay now I am lost. Network tab shows nothing when grabbing it from the seperate file-server. Shows a (obviously) small file being received from my server. Yet the movie (yes this is a DVD-RIP from a movie that I do own) is 834MB. Here is a picture of the tabs side-by-side.<br>

<p>To be honest I never even thought about the content type being the issue. I guess I’ll open up the debugger and see what it’s reading from the other file-server and make a change to see if it worked. I have it hard-coded as a damn application for content type. Never payed attention just grabbed a snippet header for file transfer to fix it. I’ll check it when I get home and let you know how it goes</p>
<p>Edit: Okay fixing the content type did not solve the issue. Working with the debugger in chrome but can’t seem to find the information I’m looking for.</p>

When uploading to GIT I was in the middle of adding a Config class and forgot to edit the MoviePage class to not link back to the other server. Its not an IP address, used in-house router address for the computer.</p>

<p>Movie-Server - basic movie server for MP4 files using HTML5 embed.</p>

<p>The problem:<br>
When linking back to the own server I can easily download the movie to other computers, which is fine but I would prefer just click and play. Currently it has to link to another file-server for the HTML5 player to actually work. When linking back to my server the file will be sent but never received by the player as far as I can tell. Not sure whats going on so I would like some help fixing that.</p>
