    <title>A newbie question about logging in</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-newbie-question-about-logging-in/370898</link>
    <description>I just downloaded the Moparscape client (along with the recent java and the JDK) and I loaded moparscape however everytime I go to start server then I create an account this happens in the black box:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[01:45:25] Server : 127.0.0.1
[01:45:25] 
[01:45:25] 
[01:45:25] Loaded 0 random handlers
[01:45:25] # Loading controllers
Server: Starting HybridScape Server on 0.0.0.0:43594
[01:45:41] Couldn&#39;t open output stream to log file Testaccount-20101128.log
[01:45:41] 
[01:45:41] Logging into (Testaccount, *****)
[01:45:41] Your UID is: 51397987
Server: ClientHandler: Accepted from 127.0.0.1:55918
Registering user testaccount with pass testing
Server: hybridscape Server (2): Exception!
Server: ClientHandler: Client testaccount disconnected.
[01:45:43] Couldn&#39;t open output stream to log file Testaccount-20101128.log

Server: ClientHandler: Accepted from 127.0.0.1:55919
Did not save for testaccount
Server: ClientHandler: Client testaccount disconnected.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and in yellow it says my account is already in use. I have windows 7 (I read its bad for mopar but its what I got...) 32 bit. May someone help me?</description>
