    <title>In wild when using spec you only hit 0&#39;s [Pi]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/in-wild-when-using-spec-you-only-hit-0s-pi/442838</link>
    <description>Alright well I have been doing some testing and found out in the wild you only hit 0&#39;s with spec no matter what I used like 15 specs and hit 0&#39;s then I did it on an npc out of the wild and it was fine and inside the wild npcs are fine but players in the wild are somehow invincible to specs... And normal weapons work fine except if you try to use spec you hit a 0 if you killing someone in the wild... I don&#39;t know why honestly.. Any help is appreciated I&#39;ll rep + if you can help.</description>
