    <title>Which would you prefer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-would-you-prefer/226221</link>
    <description>Okay, I&#39;ve been writing a 317 server lately, and am going to release it soon. But, I was wondering what you would prefer:

[ul][li]Scripting language; so far I have Python on my mind.[/li]
[li]Event Listeners[/li][/ul]


Now, I already have the ability to deregister the current listener and add your own with custom event listeners, but I need to decide whether to implement a scripting engine. 

If you do think I should implement a scripting engine, please say a scripting language; for example Python, Ruby, etc.

I&#39;m beginning to think I shouldn&#39;t due to the fact it isn&#39;t really needed because there&#39;s not much to script, as all can be done by event listeners extremely easily. Anyway, make a choice.

A definition of an event listener: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/events/index.html, this will have to be done code-wise, so you will need to reset and compile it every time.
A definition of what I mean by scripting language: (I can&#39;t find any good tutorials which explain it easily enough so I&#39;ll write a quick one).
It just allows you to create a script file, and the server will load it. So you do not actually have to modify the server at all, just write scripting files for it. This would probably be better dynamic-wise, as you wouldn&#39;t need to reset the server for things to take effect. But, the downside is that this will require quite a bit of tedious explanation to people to set the libraries up.</description>

<p>C++ isn’t a scripting language.</p>
<p>I would say python, as it forces the people who can’t ident here to either ident or quit <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Okay, I’ve been writing a 317 server lately, and am going to release it soon. But, I was wondering what you would prefer:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Scripting language; so far I have Python on my mind.[/li]<br>
[li]Event Listeners[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Now, I already have the ability to deregister the current listener and add your own with custom event listeners, but I need to decide whether to implement a scripting engine.</p>
<p>If you do think I should implement a scripting engine, please say a scripting language; for example Python, Ruby, etc.</p>
<p>I’m beginning to think I shouldn’t due to the fact it isn’t really needed because there’s not much to script, as all can be done by event listeners extremely easily. Anyway, make a choice.</p>
<p>A definition of an event listener: <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/events/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/events/index.html</a>, this will have to be done code-wise, so you will need to reset and compile it every time.<br>
A definition of what I mean by scripting language: (I can’t find any good tutorials which explain it easily enough so I’ll write a quick one).<br>
It just allows you to create a script file, and the server will load it. So you do not actually have to modify the server at all, just write scripting files for it. This would probably be better dynamic-wise, as you wouldn’t need to reset the server for things to take effect. But, the downside is that this will require quite a bit of tedious explanation to people to set the libraries up.</p>
