    <title>Which would you prefer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-would-you-prefer/393614</link>
    <description>What type of mini-game would you prefer,

One like CoD&#39;s HQ where both teams spawn and must fight to capture an objective? First one to 100 some points win?

Or

One like CoD&#39;s S&amp;D where both teams spawn one must defend others must destroy?</description>

              <p>headquarters honestly. Id like S&amp;D if I didn’t die at the beginning of the match by some idiot running around with an smg like its a TDM or a tomahawk. I tend to play HCTDM to get a mix of both, wave respawn is nice.</p>
