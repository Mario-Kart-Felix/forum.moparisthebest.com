<p>lol swoosh…theres a difference between hosting a server and receiveing money to cover hosting fees and hosting a server that receives more money then hosting fees requires, pocketing the rest n never lowering subscription cost to only cover the said hosting fees…</p>

Why are people so concerned about the Money somebody makes with their private server? It’s almost like there is an under tone of jealousy in this community for anybody who has a server that “makes” it. Man if there’s 3 to call a server provider greedy for every 100 players they have subscribing I can only imagine the conspirators trying to poke a stick at JaGeX. Oh, wait?</p>
