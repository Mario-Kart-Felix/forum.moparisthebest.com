    <description>Okay I&#39;ve just downloaded the Devolution Enhanced source which was just released today its in the downloads section. I&#39;m not sure if this is just an anti-leech or what but everything works fine and all dupes are fixed theres just one problem, you can&#39;t attack NPCs? Idk if its an anti-leech or what, but can someone help me fix it? I really need a source like this. Thanks!</description>
