    <description>Based on-PhoneScape

Hello to all. I have recently had some trouble today with getting my server up and running. I have my No-IP up and ready and a name for my server to. I also have my file on WinRAR w\ PhoneScape saved on there. Only one problem. When I go to where I saved my source-folder and open it, I try to do compile and runserver, but when I TRY to open them it says that &quot;javac&quot; not recognized as an internal or external command. Operable program or batch file. So can you help me? I&#39;ve tried the TUT&#39;s on many sections but I jsut can&#39;t seem to locate the materials I need.

Thanks
