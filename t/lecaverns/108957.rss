    <description>I&#39;m having some difficulty with the following, consider it development, because helpers will be rewarded somehow when my new server comes out, I&#39;m busy doing the touch ups that [i]I know how[/i] to do, and don&#39;t have time to mess around with it. The following is my list of problems:

- NPC combat
I want my NPC&#39;s to attack properly, and die properly, as well as facing you while attacking, telling me how to do this, or giving me a tutorial link would be extremely appreciated

-GFX
Some GFXs appear infront of me one square, such as the dragon long special, how would I make it so it projects from the square behind me?

-NPC walking
I have everything proper on my walk range, and I&#39;ve tried with both walk type 1 and type 2. Can someone give me a walkthrough on how to make npcs talk properly?

- } else { In an NPC&#39;s dialogue.
For quest making, I can&#39;t seem to get the } else if (q2stage &lt;= 2) { to work.

-Using Item on npc
Billysmithers would not work for me, so a quick walkthrough of this working would be nice.

-ANY SUGGESTIONS
I need suggestions for my server as well, it&#39;s an underground setting. I have alot but I don&#39;t want to say what :D

Thank you for your time.
