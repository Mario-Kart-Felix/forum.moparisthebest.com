    <title>LF old old games</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lf-old-old-games/264755</link>
    <description>Both these games are like 15 years old
short,
1. Venture
2. G-nome

Long drawn out cause i like typing:
Ok, I have been shit bored out of my mind, ive played like 40 games recently and bored of them all.
Then i remembered something from when i was little. A demo game from the 100 great kids game cd, I think it was called venture, you basically went through hallways and rooms by choosing a direction to face and picked up any little objects or valuables you could find. The cool thing was, you could make your own levels, but only in the full version, which i never could find, now ive even lost my demo, Can any one get me a link to the full version download, if not il be happy with the demo again lol. 

It amazes me how my favorite games fall off the face of the earth, I cant find anything about this game any where online -.-&#39;

And another one I have been looking for is Gnome, giant mech robots, My disk finally broke after years and the only computer i had it installed on didnt support usb and had some other issues, so no recovery. This one actually seems to exist but i cant find a free site to download it off of and i cant find any torrents of it. http://www.classic-pc-games.com/pc/arcade_action/g-nome.html (ive tried registering for that site but i never got emailed the activation link, tried 6 different emails all with different providers.)</description>

              <p>Well if you’ve got a playstation Id recommend Nuclear Strike or some of the Spyro games. NS is like a war game where you can pilot an Apache or Commanche helicopter, a Harrier, hovercraft, and some other planes. You go around in Asia and stuff, cant remember where exactly, and do missions blowing shit up and rescuing allies. Its got a really cool story line if I remember right, like where you’re preventing WW3 and Russia taking over, or something.</p>
<p>The Spyro the dragon games were really fun rpgs where you go around a magical world with a whole bunch of smaller, themed worlds within itself. You’d do quests for people and stuff, and the games seemed huge.<br>
I spent sooooooo many childhood hours on these its not funny. But if ur looking for Pc games then Id go with the Roller Coaster Tycoons or the Heroes of Might and Magic games, both are amazing.</p>
