    <title>Need help trying to download flash file</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-trying-to-download-flash-file/107919</link>
    <description>Well I was surfing around the web and I happened to come across this awesome virtual &quot;fish tank&quot; that could be used as a desktop background or even as a screensaver. I had tried to use IE&#39;s caching system to retrieve the cached files but the .swf file does not work meaning the &quot;fish tank&quot; would not load even though I had gotten all the files. The link to the webpage is here:
[url=http://www.papervision3d.org/]http://www.papervision3d.org/[/url]

If anyone can attach the working swf file with the image and script files that will be much appreciated. Thanks.</description>

              <p>Well then how come it doesn’t work when the file is downloaded? I am I missing a file even when I set my cache to 300,000mb ? All the files are only around 4mb. Is the file protected?</p>

              <p>I am not sure what exactly is causing this but the .swf file on the website does not seem to load on firefox only on Internet Explorer. Also is it possible to use Sothink’s SWF Catcher to save the .swf file and the images?</p>
