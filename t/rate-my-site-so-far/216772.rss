I see it the other way around. I took a short amount of time to look over your posts too. It seems you have contradicted yourself multiple times. Usually lacking any form of real sentences. You may think you have me figured out. But you don’t, you know nothing about me. And trying to judge me my by posts isn’t accurate at all. I’m through arguing with you, it’s not getting anywhere.
