    <title>Account Recovery</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/account-recovery/458698</link>
    <description>I attempted to log in today only to find that my password has been changed.  I tried to recover my account, but the email has been changed too.  I read on the site on how to recover the account with a changed email address.  They told me to Email accounthelp@jagex.com .  I quickly received a reply back from them, saying it will take up to 4 weeks for an answer.  My question is, is there a faster way to recover my account? I always remember there was an easier way to do this, but I may be mistaken.  This is the first time I&#39;ve actually tried recovering an account that was hacked, so can anyone help me out?


Oh an just for the record, In the rules it says
&lt;blockquote&gt;[font=Verdana][size=13px]No discussion of account hacking or recovering. If it isn&#39;t yours, don&#39;t take it.[/size][/font]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I am not attempting to hack or recover someone else&#39;s account, so I am not breaking any rules.  I just desperately need tips on how to recover my own account.  Any help or tips are appreciated.</description>

I cannot post on the forum because i do not have another account that has a total level abover 350 (or whatever the free to play requirement is).</p>
<p><span class="mention">@papaproach</span><br>
I have emailed Jagex with ALL the account information, such as: recent passwords, ALL recovery questions and answers, date I was hacked, etc.  I am just unable to post on the forums or anything about it because like i said i do not have an account with a 350 total level, so i’m pretty much stuck with just emailing them, which they said will take up to 4 weeks (but i’ve heard from multiple people it will only take 2 or 3, and i emailed them yesterday).</p>
<p>Thanks for the help guys.</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
If you waant, I can give you access to my old account which has like a 700 total but its f2p, assuming 350 total is the only requirement you can post with that :). Its less effort for me and I have no problem giving you access.<br>
If their are other reqs my own main can post on the forums, just tell me what you want me to write and I’ll post it for you and get back to you with what they say[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah if possible could i maybe hop on the f2p account for a couple minutes later?  I am away right now, i will PM you when i am ready.</p>

              <p>You can easily retrieve the account if you remember early passwords and it your using the same (or similar) ip it was created with.</p>
<p>Its still possible to recover it without all that but it may take a few attempts. I have had mines hacked in the past(ages ago when I was younger) and found it easy to recover it. I got given an account from a mate once and was even able to recover that after playing on it for 6 months.<br>
Gl man, try n figure out how you got hacked and take procedures to make sure it doesn’t happened again good luck.</p>
