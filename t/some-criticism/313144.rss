    <title>Some Criticism</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-criticism/313144</link>
    <description>Ok, well i&#39;ve added a few new minigames to my server and need some criticism on how they could be better or worse.

Ok, the main one is one that takes place in Buthorpe you talk to Saba he tells you if you bring him 20 of Dad&#39;s bones here will open a new shop for you. (He currently opens a shop with newbie items like Rune Scimatars, and Black platebodys). The new shop has some ddp&#39;s, full rune, etc.

How could I better that? ^.</description>
