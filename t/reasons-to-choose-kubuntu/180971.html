<p>Reasons to choose kubuntu (or ubuntu, xubuntu, etc etc):<br>
[b]</p>
<ol>
<li>The apt-get package manager. [/b] apt-get is simply superior to all other package managers that I have worked with or heard about.  I will review them here.</li>
</ol>
<p>a. RPMs:  This is the package type of mandrake, SuSe, fedora and red hat, along with numerous others.  However an RPM made for one distro most likely flat out won’t work at all for another distro, oh, it will probably install, but just break a lot of things along the way.  For more in depth info read here:  <a href="http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=article-rpm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=article-rpm</a></p>
<p>b. Portage: Gentoo’s package manager, it downloads the source code and compiles everything specifically for your machine.  Sounds great right?  Wrong.  Not only does it take potentially hours to install certain packages, you can’t ever upgrade your entire system without almost certainly breaking it entirely.  But you get a large performance gain from compiling everything from source right?  No, not really.  While with certain things such as kernels you may get a performance gain (but only if you know exactly what you are doing, portage doesn’t and can’t detect everything and therefore must aim for the general case anyway) the vast majority of your programs won’t compile any differently on different systems anyway, so you therefore would be better off or at least just as well off downloading pre-built binaries.</p>
<p>c. Apt-get: The debian package manager, which is also the one used by kubuntu, ubuntu, xubuntu etc.  Packages from different distributions are almost invariably compatible with each other (I have never found one that isn’t), even repositories are compatible.  There is a program that comes in handy sometimes called alien that will convert RPM packages to DEB packages.  You want to compile your programs like gentoo?  Certainly, just install the source package and with one command compile your program into your own DEB package that you can then simply install with apt, or distribute to other people.  This also allows for easy removal of the package if you messed something up, and easy upgrading.  Do you want to upgrade your entire system?  Apt-get can do that seamlessly without breaking dependencies and so forth.  I have yet to find a flaw with this system.</p>
<p>(I realize there are other package management systems, pacman for arch, tgz packages for slackware and probably many other obscure ones, but I haven’t used them and therefore can’t write a fair review, if you know enough about these please write a review of your own here.)</p>
<p>As you can see, apt-get is the clear winner here, now onto the next point.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
2. Ease of setup.</span>  You try to explain to people that linux is better than windows, you even show them your system and impress them.  And then you tell them to boot the linux cd to the command shell, type a myriad of complex commands to configure and set up their system exactly like they want it?  I don’t think so.  People who have used windows all of thier lives have most likely never touched the command line, and they shouldn’t have to if they don’t want to in linux either.  Kubuntu provides a livecd that they can boot up and try, and if they like it they can use a graphical installer right there on the desktop to set it up.  The default install comes with most things a common computer user would require, much more than a fresh windows install anyway.  Sure it may come with a few extras that die-hard linux users don’t want, but they are easily removed either from a fancy GUI or an ‘apt-get remove’ on the command line.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">3. Ease of use.</span>  From bootup it is a point and click operation to do practically anything you want, which is what windows users expect.  Even most setup and advanced configuration operations have a GUI now.  And of course for the diehards there is always a terminal emulator, and the actual terminal for whatever you want to do.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">4. Support.</span>  I see this as perhaps the most important aspect of using a distro with a large user base.  Chances are you will NEVER run into an issue that has not been run into by numerous people, and fixed already.  99% of the time you can type ‘name of your question/problem kubuntu’ into google and come up with hundreds of results with help.  If you do run into such an issue where you can’t find the answer on google, there are always usually over 1000 people online at any given time in the <span class="hashtag">#ubuntu</span>, <span class="hashtag">#kubuntu</span>, and <span class="hashtag">#xubuntu</span> IRC channels on <a href="http://irc.freenode.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">irc.freenode.net</a>, many of which are more than happy to walk you through the issue and get it solved.</p>
<p>Arguments I have seen against using kubuntu:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“*buntu is for noobs, use debian” (insert your preferred distro in place of debian)  The way I see it, I can install debian, spend literally hours installing and configuring all of the software I want, and still be left with older software in the repos, and a smaller userbase to refer to.  Or, I can install kubuntu, remove a few packages, install a few others, do a little configuring and have an identical system in much less time with up to date repos and a large userbase for support.  It just doesn’t make sense to set up things one at a time when I can do it all at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>add your own here!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, well if you read this whole thing good for you!  This is the longest post I have written in as long as I can remember and my fingers are tired.  Hope to get into some good debates, and maybe I convinced someone to use kubuntu! <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

        <p>Sabayon is better.</p>
<p>Even though it uses emerge, which downloads, compiles installs everything for you. What is to stop people from simply downloading source code, ./configure, make, make install</p>
<p>I installed Xubuntu and Kubuntu, and I must say it is a pretty easy install. But in my opinion Sabayon mini edition is better, clean UI, Simple installer.</p>
<p>Depending on what you choose as your DE, Fluxbox, KDE Etc. Sabayon is still pretty easy to use.</p>

I can’t help but think this post is directed at me <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowning1bce.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
Anyway, gentoo is not really as unmaintainable as you make it out to be, or it may just be me having too much time on my hands…</p>
<p>As for support, i can say the same about gentoo and arch every problem i have run into i have been able to solve with a quick google most leading to with gentoos wiki. Freenode also has a very popular <span class="hashtag">#gentoo</span> channel.<br>
I don’t hate *buntu as much as you think, i mostly say things like that because i love a <em>debate</em> or like to annoy people by saying shit i usually don’t mean <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> (As most people on irc know).</p>
<p>@ evokki` since sabayon is gentoo based you can use the <span class="hashtag">#gentoo</span> channel for probably more support than <span class="hashtag">#sabayon</span> since sabayons channel is not that well populated :p.</p>
<p>When i say *buntu sucks, its really just me saying ‘I prefer [Insert distro]’. Kamu made a great point <em>After</em> he had finished bashing ubuntu on irc - something along the lines of “Ubuntu has helped linux overall to move to more of a desktop type operating system”.</p>

        <p>Hahahahahaha. Uh, if we can present a package manager as a pro of our chosen distro, why isn’t everyone using Arch? pacman is better than apt-get. and there’s no debating that because it’s fucking fact. Moving on, the ease of setup is not a pro but a con. If I wanted to leave no room for things that I’ll use (cp, development tools, etc), I’d install everything in each of pacman’s repositories.

If you want a tiny diversion from Windows so you can say you’re “sticking it to the man”, by all means, run some dumbed-down Linux distro.

<p>Can you write up a review of some sort on pacman like I did with the above package managers?  I would like reasons why it is better.</p>
<p>As to the ease of setup, my point is that if you are starting with linux, you don’t know what you want or how you want it configured.  And even if you are a veteran linux user and know exactly what you want and how to set it up, installing arch with nothing and configuring from there leaves you with the same system as if you install kubuntu and configure from there.  That just ends up being personal preference, I would rather remove 100 packages than install 1000.</p>

<p>as i said, there’s binmerge for those that prefer binaries over source.<br>
binmerge is actually nothing more than setting the BINHOST variable and adding the --use-pkg switch to emerge.</p>
<p>also, most people will probably go for the mini-edition since it’s only as big as a cd</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Linux is not for everyone, we’ve covered that in the “one-size-fits-all” debate, its obviously not for you, since your family can afford to buy a new computer every 2 days to keep up with the updates in technology.</p>
<p>I’v had my computer for almost 6 years, and even when i got it, it was second hand, I’v reinstalled Windows countless times in an attempt to keep the machine usable, and today, when i have to boot into Windows, it always notice how slow it responds.</p>
<p>I dont have Linux so i can do “sticking it to the man”, I have it because its better.</p>
<p>Its similar with buying fish, I can either buy it from the supermarket, or i can buy it from the square where fishermen come in every day at 6 o’clock in the morning.<br>
I dont buy from the fishermen because i want to “stick it to the supermarket”, i buy it because fishermen fish are fresher, and therefore better then the supermarkets frozen variaty.</p>
<p>you get used to it, you know, you kind of accept that waiting is a part of life, but once you get used to the normal responce from Linux, you’ll never go back, if your machine is anything like mine.</p>
<p>The thing with Linux is, once you get used to it, as soon as you go back to Windows, the first thing you notice is how slow it seems. And Windows-users often come up with “Why are you saying its slow? it seems perfectly fine for me”, and they just think you’re mad/exadurating.</p>
<p>With Linux, I’v drawn out my computer’s life to 6 years, and it has no signs of letting up, perhaps ill be able to get to 10 years of use, who knows.</p>
<p>My parents workplace is getting ride of their old computers, they said we can have one if we want, I think I’ll try to revive it, perhaps install a destro where you need to compile it yourself and it takes hours, so you can compile it again and again whenever you make changes, you would learn more about that way.</p>
<p>you have to accept that the people at Microsoft and similar companies are not programmers, they are businessmen, out to make a profit.<br>

<p>Its a very good reason, price is a major part of deciding to use something or not.<br>
If i see two pencils, they both appear to do the same thing, but one costs £20 and one costs 20p, its obvious which I’ll buy.<br>

        <p>The reason that I say using Linux for money is a questionable reason is because copies of Windows are handed out like candy. It’s not exactly stretching oneself to find a copy of Windows floating around the 'net. Then again, you could be referring to the large amount of open source software on Linux. In that case, your argument is very good. I suppose you’ve shown that I was wrong in saying that I don’t run Linux for money-related purposes, because retrospect shows that the lack of a good and free IRC client on Windows was a small influence in my switching back.</p>
