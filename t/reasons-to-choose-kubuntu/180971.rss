    <title>Reasons to choose kubuntu</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reasons-to-choose-kubuntu/180971</link>
    <description>For some reason it seems a few people on this website are anti-*buntu, for no good reason as far as I can see, so I figured I would write something up as to the reasons why I choose kubuntu and why it would be a good idea for others to do the same.  Here we can debate this and maybe even come to a mutual agreement. :)

Reasons to choose kubuntu (or ubuntu, xubuntu, etc etc):
[b]
1. The apt-get package manager. [/b] apt-get is simply superior to all other package managers that I have worked with or heard about.  I will review them here.

a. RPMs:  This is the package type of mandrake, SuSe, fedora and red hat, along with numerous others.  However an RPM made for one distro most likely flat out won&#39;t work at all for another distro, oh, it will probably install, but just break a lot of things along the way.  For more in depth info read here:  http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=article-rpm

b. Portage: Gentoo&#39;s package manager, it downloads the source code and compiles everything specifically for your machine.  Sounds great right?  Wrong.  Not only does it take potentially hours to install certain packages, you can&#39;t ever upgrade your entire system without almost certainly breaking it entirely.  But you get a large performance gain from compiling everything from source right?  No, not really.  While with certain things such as kernels you may get a performance gain (but only if you know exactly what you are doing, portage doesn&#39;t and can&#39;t detect everything and therefore must aim for the general case anyway) the vast majority of your programs won&#39;t compile any differently on different systems anyway, so you therefore would be better off or at least just as well off downloading pre-built binaries.

c. Apt-get: The debian package manager, which is also the one used by kubuntu, ubuntu, xubuntu etc.  Packages from different distributions are almost invariably compatible with each other (I have never found one that isn&#39;t), even repositories are compatible.  There is a program that comes in handy sometimes called alien that will convert RPM packages to DEB packages.  You want to compile your programs like gentoo?  Certainly, just install the source package and with one command compile your program into your own DEB package that you can then simply install with apt, or distribute to other people.  This also allows for easy removal of the package if you messed something up, and easy upgrading.  Do you want to upgrade your entire system?  Apt-get can do that seamlessly without breaking dependencies and so forth.  I have yet to find a flaw with this system.

(I realize there are other package management systems, pacman for arch, tgz packages for slackware and probably many other obscure ones, but I haven&#39;t used them and therefore can&#39;t write a fair review, if you know enough about these please write a review of your own here.)

As you can see, apt-get is the clear winner here, now onto the next point.
[b]
2. Ease of setup.[/b]  You try to explain to people that linux is better than windows, you even show them your system and impress them.  And then you tell them to boot the linux cd to the command shell, type a myriad of complex commands to configure and set up their system exactly like they want it?  I don&#39;t think so.  People who have used windows all of thier lives have most likely never touched the command line, and they shouldn&#39;t have to if they don&#39;t want to in linux either.  Kubuntu provides a livecd that they can boot up and try, and if they like it they can use a graphical installer right there on the desktop to set it up.  The default install comes with most things a common computer user would require, much more than a fresh windows install anyway.  Sure it may come with a few extras that die-hard linux users don&#39;t want, but they are easily removed either from a fancy GUI or an &#39;apt-get remove&#39; on the command line.

[b]3. Ease of use.[/b]  From bootup it is a point and click operation to do practically anything you want, which is what windows users expect.  Even most setup and advanced configuration operations have a GUI now.  And of course for the diehards there is always a terminal emulator, and the actual terminal for whatever you want to do.

[b]4. Support.[/b]  I see this as perhaps the most important aspect of using a distro with a large user base.  Chances are you will NEVER run into an issue that has not been run into by numerous people, and fixed already.  99% of the time you can type &#39;name of your question/problem kubuntu&#39; into google and come up with hundreds of results with help.  If you do run into such an issue where you can&#39;t find the answer on google, there are always usually over 1000 people online at any given time in the #ubuntu, #kubuntu, and #xubuntu IRC channels on irc.freenode.net, many of which are more than happy to walk you through the issue and get it solved.  

Arguments I have seen against using kubuntu:

1.  &quot;*buntu is for noobs, use debian&quot; (insert your preferred distro in place of debian)  The way I see it, I can install debian, spend literally hours installing and configuring all of the software I want, and still be left with older software in the repos, and a smaller userbase to refer to.  Or, I can install kubuntu, remove a few packages, install a few others, do a little configuring and have an identical system in much less time with up to date repos and a large userbase for support.  It just doesn&#39;t make sense to set up things one at a time when I can do it all at once.

2. add your own here!

Alright, well if you read this whole thing good for you!  This is the longest post I have written in as long as I can remember and my fingers are tired.  Hope to get into some good debates, and maybe I convinced someone to use kubuntu! :D</description>

<p>If it supports Athlon64, it will almost certainly support the Turion. They both use the AMD64 instruction-set (the distro maintainers really should label their distros “AMD64” not “Athlon64”, unless it ONLY supports the Athlon… but I’m willing to bet they don’t and it will be fine).</p>

<p>Arch is better than any other distro out there imo. *buntu is too bloated and full of useless stuff. It’s incredibly slow as well, you might as well run windows. Xfce is the best WM btw, extremely lightweight and still contains everything you need + it looks sexy.<br>
Also, arch is piss easy to install. They have a wiki page on how to install it for linux beginners. It’s well-documented and simple to follow. It taught me alot about unix in general as well.</p>

Arch is better than any other distro out there imo. *buntu is too bloated and full of useless stuff. It’s incredibly slow as well, you might as well run windows. Xfce is the best WM btw, extremely lightweight and still contains everything you need + it looks sexy.<br>
Also, arch is piss easy to install. They have a wiki page on how to install it for linux beginners. It’s well-documented and simple to follow. It taught me alot about unix in general as well.<br>

<p>That makes no sense.</p>
<p>ArchLinux is optimised for i686 (well, and x64 for the 64-bit version). It will not run on anything else.</p>
<p>DSL is optimised for what, i386?</p>
<p>I suspect Arch would be faster.</p>

<p>I have noticed 1 thing about pacman though, it seems to be smarter (I guess you can say) in a sense.</p>
<p>in apt you do:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo apt-get install php5 mysql5 apache2</code></pre>
<p>in pacman you do:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo pacman -S apache mysql php</code></pre>
<p>the same for the jdk, with apt it’s like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk</code></pre>
<p>with pacman:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo pacman -S jdk</code></pre>
<p>it automatically gets the latest version, although I didn’t try to just do that with apt so it may be the same <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>I agree with Mopman’s assessment of that article.  However KDE is still better than GNOME. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Well I don’t know about Kubuntu over * but heres a good comparision I found for KDE and GNOME</p>
<blockquote>KDE
<p>A big room somewhere in Europe with lots of chrome and glass and a great big whiteboard in the front with lots of tiny, neat writing on it. There are about 50 desks, each with headphones and pristine workstations, also with a lot of chrome and glass. The faint sound of classical music permeates the room, accompanying the clicky-click of 50 programmers typing or quietly talking in one of the appropriately assigned meeting areas. (Which of course consist of elegant contemporary white pine coffee tables surrounded by contemporary white pine and fine leather meeting chairs.) Coffee, tea, mineral water and fruit juices are available in the break area.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, <em>everyone</em> checks in their code and the project leader does a “make” just to make sure it all compiles cleanly, but it’s mostly only done from tradition anymore since it always compiles cleanly and works flawlessly. When all milestones have been met, and everything has been QA’d, (usually within a day or two of the roadmap that was written up 18 months previous) a new KDE release is packaged up and released to the mirror sites with the appropriate 24-hour delay for distribution before being announced.</p>
<p>KDE developers are generally between the ages of 16 and 25, like art made of lines and squares and the colors white and black. When/if they finally stop taking government subsidies and get around to getting “real jobs,” most of their salary will be taken in taxes so the socialist government can subsidize the care and feeding of the next generation of KDE developers, just like it did for them. A high percentage of KDE developers, during their mandatory 5 years of government military service, crack from their years of cultural dullness and flee Europe to become terrorists for the sheer joy to be found in killing random strangers for no discernible reason.</p>
<p>GNOME</p>
<p>An abandoned warehouse in San Francisco, kitted up as for a rave, electronica playing at 15db louder than “my ears are bleeding and I’m developing an aneurism” volumes and the windows all painted over black so that the strobe and spotlights and lasers can be seen better. Computers, mainly made of whatever stuff has been exchanged for crack or scavenged from dumpsters behind dot-bombs, are scattered around on whatever furniture is available, which also consists of whatever stuff has been exchanged for crack or scavenged from dumpsters behind dot-bombs. There’s no break area, but you may be able to bum a beer (or more likely something harder) off of one of the developers hanging around, and they will probably be too jacked up on X, coke, acid, heroin, ether or all of the above to notice that you’ve taken anything.</p>
<p>Development strategies are generally determined by whatever light show happens to be going on at the moment, when one of the developers will leap up and scream “I WANT IT TO LOOK JUST LIKE THAT” and then straight-arm his laptop against the wall in an hallucinogenic frenzy before vomiting copiously, passing out and falling face-down in the middle of the dance floor. There’s no whiteboard, so developers diagram things out in the puddles of spilt beer, urine and vomit on the floor.</p>
<p>At the end of the day - whenever that is since an equal number of programmers will be passed out at any given time - or really whenever someone happens to think of it (which is rarely), someone might type “make” on some machine somewhere, with mixed results. Generally nothing happens, so he/she shrugs his/her shoulders and wanders off to look for someone who might have more pink/black-striped pills. Once in a great while, generally in the unpleasant time between the come-down from the last thing they took and before whatever it was they took just now comes on fully, someone will tar up a bunch of random files and post it on a website someplace it as the next GNOME release, usually with a reference to some kind of monkey.</p>
<p>GNOME developers rarely live past 25 and prefer “alternative” art - generally stuff made of feces that’s “too edgy” for most people to “understand” or “like.” Core GNOME developers are heavy Ketamine users. The bodies of GNOME developers can often be found in dumpsters or floating face-down in any sufficiently large body of water.</p>

              <p>I use Kubuntu because I haven’t been bothered to try something else, I don’t feel the need too which is the main reason. It has EVERYTHING I would want. It’s fast enough for me, I’m not a hard-core computer user, as some people here are. That will probably change as I become more competent on a computer, but until then, so far Kubuntu is perfect for me. I want to try Archlinux, and I’m quite sure Kamu would like to see me do so too. =]</p>
