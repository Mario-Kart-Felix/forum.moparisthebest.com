    <title>Server not connecting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-not-connecting/252608</link>
    <description>Ok, so I don&#39;t know much at all about this whole moparscape/compiler/client thing. Now, I got to the moparscape website, and when I try to run the game from there it says &quot;Error connecting to server. Must be down. Click &quot;Start server&quot; to make your own.&quot; So, I tried just that, and got the same thing. I then go to the server status page, and tried numerous different servers. Still, I get the same result. So now, I try downloading the moparscape client. It opens up fine, and when I try to log in, I get an error saying: &quot;Account is already logged in. Try again, or make a different account name.&quot; So, again I follow the instructions, with no result. Confused, I run to the forums, looking at guides. I follow everything on them (Downloading the latest java, reinstalling moparscape) And still these same results keep on coming up. Help would be appreciated :)

I have also tried searching the site for topics that have had the same problems, but they were all solved by the things that mine weren&#39;t.</description>

<p>I tried all of this, and it’s still not working. I just get “Error connecting to server”. I have allowed the port through the firewall, I’ve done all of the portforwarding and yet it still tells me there’s an error whilst trying to connect to the server.</p>
