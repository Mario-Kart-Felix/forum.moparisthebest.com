    <title>Server not connecting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-not-connecting/260960</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve downloaded the Moparscape client and everytime I try and log in it always says &#39;Error connecting to the server. Must be down. Click &quot;cancel&quot; then &quot;Start server&quot; to make your own.

Yet the server I&#39;m using already IS my own, yet I clicked cancel and start server and went back to the login page and the same details including the same server ip were still there and once again it came up with that message. Could anyone please help me? :confused:

Thank you</description>
