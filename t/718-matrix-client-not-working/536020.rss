    <title>718 matrix client not working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-matrix-client-not-working/536020</link>
    <description>Earlier today i downloaded a 718 source as well as 718/742 cache and a 718 client. I&#39;m only trying to connect to local but the client is still not connecting, its giving me the error_game js5connect. I think the server side is fine, i ran the server and it says its online and the cache is in the data folder. for the client side i went in to loader and set all the ip&#39;s to 127.0.0.1 and recompiled, but its still not working. ive also portforwarded. please help im so  :confused: right now</description>
