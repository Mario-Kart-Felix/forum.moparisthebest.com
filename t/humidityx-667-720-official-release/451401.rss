[b]Good Evening,

The reason I took along time was because I was waiting for my unban which is now sorted. Finally, After working since November 2011 on my source, I am going to release it because I&#39;m going back to 614 Development. In this source there are 5 Anti leeches.

I do NOT want anyone leeching my source, that is the reason I included them.  I do NOT give permission to ANYONE re releasing a fixed version of my source or releasing my source anywhere but Rune-Server. I have a reputation on Rune-Server so my source must remain on Rune-Server. Hint for one of the anti leeches: &quot;Libs&quot; Good luck everyone :)[/b]

[b]The download link is a package of my source, client, cache, forums files, cache stuff; this includes, item editors, sprite editors, packers, cache downloaders and so so much more hence it&#39;s 1.2GB. It&#39;s got previous cache versions inside it aswell. There are exactly 10 different cache tools.[/b]

[b][u]HumidityX Biography[/u]

To Be honest with you; On my projects: 317 377 428 503 508 525 614 I&#39;ve just leached. Back in September I got my first 639 Source and I never really understood the lower revisions so I actually started coding for real since then and learning. Yes I was the owner of EyreScape639 and people to this day still use my release such as RawrScape &amp; QuantumX. My Old name was Fox and my old server name was EyreScape.

Back In November I moved onto the FIRST EVER 667 on which today I still have that this is. A player named &quot;thebacon&quot; sold me the source and his friend can decompile clients so he gave me the decompiled Matrix client. I was one of the top 5 people to get it the earliest possible. Back then I payed for my 667 for $25 because I&#39;ve always loved the higher revisions and were the only revisions I could use dispite the fact that other Rune-Server players would tell me to start at a 317. Now I have enhanced my knowledge, I&#39;m not the best coder and like a human; yes I do get stuck but I literally love programming to the Extreme and would love to learn more and more. It would be kind of you guys to set me up with a few tips if possible and I literally ask for nothing more. You respect me and I respect you.

Since I got my 667 now for 11 months I have been working on my source and if you see my source layout like my classes, txt and java files It&#39;s totally different from when I got my source back then. I&#39;ll probably never release my source for another year or two (depends) however when I do release it, I would love people to take the oppertunity of my source and learn to program like I did. At the moment it&#39;s all Trial and error for me and as I mentioned above I would love some useful/helpful tips.

During my time with 667s I got the new client (matrix) which had malicious content in it which I was un aware of and I got banned on Rune-Server. I honestly didn&#39;t know about it, Mister Maggot my good friend removed it for me and since that day I have been unbanned, not to mention; I&#39;ve never ever broken a rule on Rune-Server. I hope everyone appriciates my work like I do to theirs. You will most likeley never see me put a harrasfull post on a reply to a thread or another post or even anywhere because it&#39;s just the person I am. I treat people the way I&#39;d  like to be treated. I would just like to say thank you to all my friends in my programming/Rune-Server experiance so far; Erica, Beta, Vincent, Vin, Gf_u, Rudie, Eric (Fatality614), Chronic, Coombser (Old 317 Developer), Scu11,  Sean, Poseidon (Apolo), Shabba56 (for the amazing Disturbed), Logan, VoltageScape (Tyler, Ben &amp; Isaac) - hope you remember me Ex-Moderator Ags Vs Claws, legitimate, James Lawrence, Mister Maggot, Sway, Zelt,  Rs Wiki, Tizen, Tyro, Zach, Rising King, and a few others at the back of my head...[/b]

[b]Thanks For Reading,

Owner Of HumidityX,[/b]
