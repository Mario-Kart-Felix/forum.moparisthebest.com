    <title>Stripping, and unstripping?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stripping-and-unstripping/442573</link>
    <description>I found two different versions of the 614 server i was looking for, i downloaded both,
on the first one, you cannot take off any items, and on the second one, you cant wear anything, so i was thinking i could just rip one from the other, what class or file would i look at to wear stuff.

Basically i need to know what class or file, that allows you to wear items, so i could rip it and add it to my other source, its 614.</description>
