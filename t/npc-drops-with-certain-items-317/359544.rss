    <title>Npc drops with certain items 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-drops-with-certain-items-317/359544</link>
    <description>Ok lets say I have a bronze defender in my inventory. How would I make it so that the npc would drop an iron defender or above only if I had the latest defender.. heres an example if that was confusing. Like the warriors guild. You go in with an addy defender and they drop rune defenders.. Nothing else below or above

Delta 317

Thanks for the help from this confusing question</description>
