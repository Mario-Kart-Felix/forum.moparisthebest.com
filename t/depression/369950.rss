    <description>My sister is really depressed. She cries every night And complains she has no friends and she&#39;s ugly and that she&#39;s fat. All if these are false, but she won&#39;t listen to me or anybody else. She says she has contemplated suicide and if it weren&#39;t for me she might already have. I am trying everything to cheer her up, but to no avail. Please help me. I hate seeing her like this.</description>

<p>I have finally managed to get her a hobby, probably not a good one, but she loves Oblivion. Also thanks to you guys, I know how to handle the situation, when she starts telling me she’s depressed. I don’t look at my sister as being a immature 13 year old, because she is very smart for her age. I don’t mean just grade wise. I mean she can converse with an adult and not look stupid. But I also have opened my eyes a little bit to see that she is indeed only 13. And that I shouldn’t take this as serious. I still take making her feel good serious, but her threats to commit suicide less seriously. You guys have made me understand what depression really is, I never really understood it. And I feel this topic has really hit home at a lot of people on these forums by the looks of it. Thank you all.</p>

<p>Internet is most definitely not the best idea. If she ever met a bunch of psychos like us online, suicide would be first on the agenda. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Depression can bring upon thoughts that life lacks meaning. Joining the army&gt;search for meaning&gt;???&gt;find meaning/death/continuation of previous depression<br>
[/quote]<br>
No you join the army because it makes you a stronger person, you help people (gives your life meaning) and makes you a better person over all. The only ones the army kills are those trying to harm others greatly.[/quote]<br>
You have yet to give a good excuse to make it worth looking into when you are in deep depression. You seem to miss the fast, Sergeants will be in your face yelling at you constantly to cause high stress while you are there, so that you are used to it when you are deployed. Does this sound like an ideal place for someone who has considered suicide? I don’t think so Andrew.</p>

<p>Depression can bring upon thoughts that life lacks meaning. Joining the army&gt;search for meaning&gt;???&gt;find meaning/death/continuation of previous depression[/quote]<br>
No you join the army because it makes you a stronger person, you help people (gives your life meaning) and makes you a better person over all. The only ones the army kills are those trying to harm others greatly.</p>

Plus I would hate to have to trust them to protect my back when there depressed. Already many people get depressed because they miss there family and friends. No the Army for a depressed person is not the best idea.</p>

<p>I’m not saying you shouldn’t take her seriously… But if none of this is true, I find it highly unlikely that she will pursue to end her life. There is no motive. Tell her to get a hobby (not being an asshole).</p>

<p>I think that’s just the blunt and honest truth, but how do you go about saying that to somebody? It’ll just make them feel worse.</p>
<p>This is why you have to keep persistent at reassuring someone the opposite of what they are feeling inside.</p>
