    <title>Changing hotkeys</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-hotkeys/340866</link>
    <description>I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to change the hotkeys like f1 opens attack options atm but I want it to open inventory. Like the real runescape ones are.

This is for 508/525 btw.

I found keypressed in class123 but it didn&#39;t have anything about hotkeys. I found many tuorials for 317s but it doesn&#39;t work for 508/525 clients because it&#39;s in a different file.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks :)</description>
