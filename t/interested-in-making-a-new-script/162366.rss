    <title>Interested in Making a New Script?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/interested-in-making-a-new-script/162366</link>
    <description>If you have experience at making scripts and would not mind helping out someone who is not so experienced, please continue reading. I am hoping to make a rune essence, mining script, since no one seems to have one that works with SCAR 3.13. If you have Ventrilo or TeamSpeak we could talk over that while we work on it which would make creating the script much easier. If anyone is still interested please either post in this thread or send me a message. All feedback is appreciated.
