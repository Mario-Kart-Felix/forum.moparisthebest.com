    <title>Need help with C assignment!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-c-assignment/553998</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m trying to make this C app but can&#39;t get my head around it. 

Task:
&lt;blockquote&gt;• You are required to write a single program that merges two input text files, one line at a time, and then saves the output to a new file – with the file contents reversed!

• The program should also produce statistics on the contents of each input file

(number of characters, words, lines, etc.). These should be displayed on the screen.

• If one input file is shorter than the other then the remainder of the larger file should be added to the end of the output file.

• The user should be prompted to enter the filenames of the input files and output files.

• The program must be written in C within Microsoft Visual Studio.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here is my current code: 

[code=c]

// ConsoleApplication1.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.

#include &quot;stdafx.h&quot;
#include &quot;stdio.h&quot;

int main()
{

	//The size is 256 because that is the max file name length a file can have
	char file1[256]; //first file name
	char file2[256]; //second file name
	char output[256]; //the name of the file that will be outputted

	printf(&quot;Enter first file name: &quot;); //ask user for first file name
	scanf(&quot;%s&quot;, &amp;file1); //store what the user enters into char[] file1

	printf(&quot;Enter second file name: &quot;); //ask user for second file name
	scanf(&quot;%s&quot;, &amp;file2); //store what the user enteres into char[] file2

	printf(&quot;Enter output file name: &quot;); //ask user for output file name
	scanf(&quot;%s&quot;, &amp;output); //store what the use enters into char[] output

	FILE *f1 = fopen(file1, &quot;r&quot;); //opens file1 in read-only mode
	FILE *f2 = fopen(file2, &quot;r&quot;); //opens file2 in read-only mode
	FILE *out = fopen(output, &quot;w&quot;); //opens (or creates if not present, i think) the output file in write mode
	if (out == NULL) {
		out = fopen(output, &quot;wb&quot;);
	}


	char f1_content[300]; // the contents on file1 

	int index = 0; //cursor to navigate in arrays
	char i; //the content read from file
	while (i = fgetc(f1) != EOF) {
		f1_content[index++] = i; //adds the file1 content to f1_content
	}

	char f2_content[300]; //the contents of file2
	index = 0; //reset index
	while (i = fgetc(f1) != EOF) {
		f2_content[index++] = i; //adds file2 content to f2_content
	}

	//merge file1 and file2
	//char out1[1000];//the output file size (1000 is the size because it seems resonable)

	for (i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
		//Adds file1 contents into each line that is a odd number 
		if (i % 2 != 0) {
			output[i] = f1_content[i];
		}
		else {
			//Add content of file2 into even number line
			output[i] = f2_content[i];
		}
	}

	//TODO: output file
	int j;
	for (j = 0; j &lt; sizeof(output) / sizeof(int); j++) {
		fprintf(out, &quot;%c\n&quot;, output[j]);
		printf(&quot;%c&quot;, output[j]);
	}
	

	//Close all the files after we are done
	fclose(f1);
	fclose(f2);
	fclose(out);

	char t;
	scanf(&quot;%s&quot;, &amp;t);
	return 0;
}

<p>To be honest <span class="bbcode-i">why</span> would you recommend an obsolete C book. I get that it’s a classic (and every C programmer should own it) but I can’t see why this would be a good idea for a beginner in 2016.</p>
<p>(If you want a fantastic introductory C book that is more modern try this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Modern-Approach-2nd-Edition/dp/0393979504" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Modern-Approach-2nd-Edition/dp/0393979504</a>) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>since you’re merging the two files line by line you might as well read the file by line instead of by char since you have no reason to read one char at a time, as i believe it’s a little faster. additionally i would read both files at the same time so you can simplify your problem by using only one buffer. then you can just iterate backwards.</p>
