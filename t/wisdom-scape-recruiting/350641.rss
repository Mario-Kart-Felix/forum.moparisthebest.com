    <description>[center]Wisdom Scape[/center]

[center]What can I say, we&#39;re a new server, thats hoping to get a dev team that can make our server totally amazing.
I got lots of great ideas ready to be shared. All I need is for them to happen.[/center]

. About us / What we somewhat want, revamped, and written down.

Well, Wisdom scape is started as friends just wanting their own server. We want something that players will like, and enjoy. Something different. Something that pops, and makes players want to stay. Something that doesn&#39;t get you bored after 3 days of playing. We are going to be ran off community, skilling and money making, and so you have to earn things. But, we will have pking features for thoughs who like pking. Pking is fun, if theirs nice arenas, bennofits, and things that make pking enjoyable, and so you can make some money off of it.

If you can help out, it will be greatfully appreciated. Coders are what make servers runs. Being able to update glitches, and fix bugs as soon as possible, being able to fix things to players needs. Thats what we want. And thats what were looking for.
