    <title>[Warning] - Fraudulent User Acting As Developer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/warning-fraudulent-user-acting-as-developer/478966</link>
    <description>Please take note i had posted this on my website and pasted it here.


He has also claimed he has hacked Trisidia&#39;s MoparScape account, whether this is true or not i don&#39;t know.


&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the past 24 hours you may of noticed the user &quot;High Detail&quot; has been demoted to a banned user, reason being his fraudulent actions towards to community is making the website look very unprofessional. Please be careful of anyone named &quot;Mike Hurst&quot;. Hes been claiming to be a guy called &quot;Trisidia&quot; who developed a server and seems to be well known due to the money this guy made from his account.


Heres some conversations the user has had with myself.

Not only has he done this, but hes also tried to chargeback numerous subscriptions he has previously had to Top-List forums, which i doubt he will succeed at regaining as PayPal never refund for virtual items.


Heres some information on the user so you don&#39;t get yourself mugged off by him.
