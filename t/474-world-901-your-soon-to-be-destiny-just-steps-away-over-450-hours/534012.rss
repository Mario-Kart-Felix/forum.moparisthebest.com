Hello, and welcome to the official World 901 advertisement. What is World 901 you may ask? World 901 is a relatively new RSPS based on the #474 revision. We look to provide fun, lasting content that will keep our users engaged. We also look to provide a great community so everyone can react friendly to one-another. All-in-all, we hope you enjoy a joyful experience.

World 901 is here to offer something different to the community. We DO NOT (and that&#39;s strictly a NOT) proclaim ourselves unique, nor will we. World 901 is here so you can see RuneScape a different way. Every idea is thought by the Owner Arham 4 and Co-Owner Andrew, and if they are thought by anyone else, they will be credited.

[size=18pt][b]Ideas[/b][/size]
[size=1]The full list of ideas are [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,642510.0.html]here[/url], however, here are our allstar ideas.[/size]

[u]The Wilderness[/u]
In normal RuneScape, when you are above level 20 wilderness, you may not teleport. While this is still true in World 901, there is another catch. The catch? You may not view your minimap above that level of the wilderness.

[img]http://puu.sh/4r6HO.png[/img] [b][u]Add-ons to combat[/u][/b]
RuneScape&#39;s combat tends to be the same. Now we aren&#39;t looking to make a new EoC or anything, but we ARE looking to add some nice features.

If the player is using the [i]slash[/i] combat style, the player has a chance to make the opponent bleed. If the player is using Ranged, the player has a chance to make an arrow stuck in the opponent&#39;s skin. Also, if the player is using Ranged, and the combat style is [i]accurate[/i] then they have a more accurate chance of getting the arrow stuck in the opponents skin. The victim, in turn, will try every turn of theirs to get the arrow out until they succeed doing so. Now, I will summarize every possibility.

Combat Type (Melee or Ranged) --- Combat style (Stab, Accurate, Slash, etc.) --- Effect --- Percent chance for effect
[hr]
Melee --- Stab --- The ability to make the opponents Attack decrease by 2 - 5. --- 10%
Melee --- Slash --- The ability to make the opponent Bleed. --- 5%
Melee --- Crush --- Crush the player. Inflicting 1/8 of their health. --- 10%
Ranged --- Make an arrow stuck on the victim. --- 5%
[hr]
Effect --- Remedies
[hr]
Bleed --- Put a bandage on.
Having an arrow stuck on you --- Wear Magic Secateurs or wait for the effect to go away. Your player has a 70% chance of taking the arrow out themseves. However, if he does, it will hurt your player considerable damage.
Having a stat drained --- Drink a restore potion.
Having yourself get crushed --- Wearing something that neutralizes crush effect (chainbodies, or a sq shield, or defenders).

[u]Transportation[/u]
Instead of teleporting, you can either walk, run, chariot, or simply teleport. This option interface will occur as soon as you click the teleport. Chariot is the fastest way of transportation, running is 3x slower, and walking is 2x slower than running. The time it takes is determined by tiles.

[center][img]http://puu.sh/42Ucm.jpg[/img][/center]

[u]Recoil[/u]
After doing a special attack, you get recoil damage. The damage itself is determined by what weapon did the special attack. The basic idea of it will be that it hits 25% of the damage given.

Now do note, only SOME weapons will have recoil, not all. Weapons like the barrelchest anchor, saradomin sword, and the armadyl godsword will have this effect. Simple things like the dragon dagger will NOT have this effect.

If the player kills the opponent from the special attack, there is no recoil damage.

[img]http://puu.sh/4r6HO.png[/img] [u][b]World 901 - The Minigame[/b][/u]
Runescape&#39;s worst rulebreakers are put in to World 901, an abandoned and corrupt version of Draynor Village. Only one can survive and win their freedom...

[b]Idea[/b]
As soon as you start, a player named &#39;Host&#39; will arrive. He will say in all the contestants chat (like dialogue), &quot;Welcome, to World 901 - The Minigame. however_many_people_are_in_the_minigame of the world&#39;s greatest rulebreakers in the game have been put in this minigame, in order to prove who is the best player. The winner will receive an immense reward, and the rest, will receive a small reward for trying. We wish you luck.&quot;

Of course, the contestants aren&#39;t really &#39;the world&#39;s greatest rulebreakers in the game&#39;, that&#39;s just to copy the World 901 movie.

[b]Location[/b]
The location of this minigame will be in a fake Draynor Village.

[b]&#39;Contestants Remaining&#39;[/b]
Instead of making it typically that the counter stays on with the &#39;Contestants Remaining&#39;, we will make it appear on the screen every time a person dies. So, for example, there are 20 players in the minigame. The &#39;Contestants Remaining&#39; will appear on the screen for 5 minutes, then it will go away. Player 20 dies, so for all the 19 contestants remaining, the &#39;Contestants Remaining&#39; will appear on the screen for another 5 seconds, and then it will go away.

We are doing this for 2 reasons:

[ol][li]The World 901 movie did this.[/li]
[li]We find that it will make more &#39;suspense&#39;.[/li][/ol]

[u]The Central Trading Hub[/u]

The Central Trading Hub is located in Falador&#39;s garden and is the new trading area. You may still trade anywhere, but think of it like this. You&#39;re trying to find something and you can&#39;t find anyone that has it. Go to the Central Trading Hub then!

I guess all my support for World 901 is gone. I have done tons of updates (3 per day), but I can’t update due to lack of replies…<br>
[/quote]<br>
Your support is gone because you’re coding small things into a barely playable server. It took you over a week to code 4 bandits, a bandit champion, and a chest with a key. The server needs massive amounts of updating and it needs to  be done asap if you want to take this out of BETA. I am pretty sure I can’t use pathing to find my enemy if it moves, gain any amount of gold unless I grind on simple things for copious amounts of time even with a 50x rate. Shops still should be removed, and a lot more to boot. You know what I think about the server, our skype convos have pretty much everything. I would suggest bumping the advertisement thread once in a while to get testers to check things out and find out what you are going to offer those who are testers when the server comes out of BETA.[/quote]<br>
It really did take me only a day to make those bandits. I appreciate everything you’ve discussed with me, so I’ll review what we’ve talked about.</p>
<p>I never really expected much of a player base. I just wanted a nice, small community. I just don’t know how to manage time NOW. When I let this server up, I boomed out updates. Then, with my brother seriously doing college work now, he took over the computer with me only getting a mere 1 - 2 hours compared to the 5 - 6 hours I used to have.</p>
<p>I’m not some slacker, but you can say I am really relaxed. I will change a login message in 5 minutes just due to me not having that personality to do some straight and right away. We have different personalities in programming.</p>
<p>The players are really loving my updates (you too with the updates of Slagilith and Mudskipper). Being a relatively small community at the moment (everyone knows each other), and me planning to full-on advertise, i will do-so after I get some priorities clear (lag issues, donations, etc.) ahead and make more money making ways, ill be sure to keep this bumped.</p>
<p>I hope you understand my situation right now.</p>
<p>EDIT: I did tell you I did ~3 - 4 updates a day.</p>

<p>I learned this from clawz fury. We had it at 10 ticks, and that made the server muuchhh worse. So I removed it for this past month. Now I notice that after 1 whole day of running the server, the server becomes VERY laggy to the extent where you can barely walk. So, after seeing that, I added the garbage cleaner for every 30 mins.<br>

Possibly. I have learned so much from the start of World 901 to right now. I should really take some time to fix my HORRIBLE code I made in the past.</p>

<p>I learned this from clawz fury. We had it at 10 ticks, and that made the server muuchhh worse. So I removed it for this past month. Now I notice that after 1 whole day of running the server, the server becomes VERY laggy to the extent where you can barely walk. So, after seeing that, I added the garbage cleaner for every 30 mins.</p>
