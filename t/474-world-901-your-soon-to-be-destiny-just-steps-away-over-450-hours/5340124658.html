I am not familiar with your xp rate, but a gradual decrease once a decent amount of players have hit the “limbo” stage of their skills may be a good idea. This gives original players a good boost to help the economy, then gently lets them down so that they can keep walking rather than fall on their faces with a super low exp rate.</p>
<p>That also depends on the type of server. I really liked it when a server had a good range of monsters to train on that were somewhat dispersed around the world, and sometimes had lower leveled bosses. This way it didn’t become Grindfest 2013. I would really like to see more servers incorporating the idea of a lower xp rate (2-10x) and using custom level mini boss areas.</p>
<p>Maybe try giving level 10 players the ability to fight a “Goblin Brute” or something that drops a rare item that can be traded in for something by an NPC at your spawn? Kind of like revnants but I would suggest avoiding monetary rewards, as those just help bloat the economy with wealth. Maybe something like a “boss token” that can be redeemed for some cool gear? Just an idea should you decide to take my suggestions ;).</p>

I will take maybe 3? No… 2! Naw, 1!</p>
<p>NO, ALL OF THEM!</p>
<p>I love this. This is exactly (besides the brute part), and I mean exactly, what I put as my aim in my servers. Low xp rates, a good variety of npcs not in some stupid “training area teleport”, but dispersed around the land, everything!</p>
<p>Sadly, I cannot lower XP rates, the reason being that I did a <a href="http://world901.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=105" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">community vote</a>, and the community voted for 50x.</p>

<p>I am not familiar with your xp rate, but a gradual decrease once a decent amount of players have hit the “limbo” stage of their skills may be a good idea. This gives original players a good boost to help the economy, then gently lets them down so that they can keep walking rather than fall on their faces with a super low exp rate.</p>
<p>That also depends on the type of server. I really liked it when a server had a good range of monsters to train on that were somewhat dispersed around the world, and sometimes had lower leveled bosses. This way it didn’t become Grindfest 2013. I would really like to see more servers incorporating the idea of a lower xp rate (2-10x) and using custom level mini boss areas.</p>
<p>Maybe try giving level 10 players the ability to fight a “Goblin Brute” or something that drops a rare item that can be traded in for something by an NPC at your spawn? Kind of like revnants but I would suggest avoiding monetary rewards, as those just help bloat the economy with wealth. Maybe something like a “boss token” that can be redeemed for some cool gear? Just an idea should you decide to take my suggestions ;).<br>

<p>I love this. This is exactly (besides the brute part), and I mean exactly, what I put as my aim in my servers. Low xp rates, a good variety of npcs not in some stupid “training area teleport”, but dispersed around the land, everything!</p>
<p>Sadly, I cannot lower XP rates, the reason being that I did a <a href="http://world901.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=105" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">community vote</a>, and the community voted for 50x.[/quote]<br>
50x is great for a base rate to help those dedicated players get set up for ~2 weeks. However, I would suggest announcing that in 2 weeks the xp rate would be lowered to 40x, and subsequently lowered each week by 10x until we reach 10x rate. That is a month of great xp rates, which gives loyal members the ability to really get their levels up while staff kicks out some great ways to gain xp and awesome activities for players to try their new levels on.</p>
<p>Remember, players want high xp rates because most of them are concerned with what they get out of the xp rate. As a leader, you are responsible to ensure the longevity of your server.</p>

You know what, that’s an amazing idea. Players would flock to the server to get the 50 times XP rate, 40 times XP rate, 30 times XP rate, and the 20 times XP rate in that month in an attempt to get their skills higher earlier on. It could get a good playerbase.</p>
<p>In private beta, XP rates were 100 times. I forgot to change it. It’s still 100 times. Perhaps I can slowly make it 50x, yes?</p>

I would make it 50x right now and with that make the announcement that in the upcoming weeks the exp rate will continually be lowered at a gradual place. This gives you the ability to set a new standard for your server and not seem like a cruel dictator that just wants to make things harder all of a sudden.</p>
<p>All it really takes is a couple dozen players and decent release of content to get players interested. If you really want to succeed, make sure you make custom loot tables for an array of monsters that are normally not in most servers. People like originality and exploration to see what makes a server different than the others.</p>
