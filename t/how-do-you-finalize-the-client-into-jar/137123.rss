    <title>How do you finalize the client into .jar?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-finalize-the-client-into-jar/137123</link>
    <description>It seems only clients with .jar as the main client file work for me. Whenever I download a client with run.bat and compile.bat, it doesn&#39;t work. So how to you take all of the class and java files including the batch files. And make a jar with it?</description>
