<p>[quote]A girl goes into the doctor’s office for a checkup. As she takes off her blouse, the doctor notices a red ‘H’ on her chest. “How did you get that mark on your chest?” asks the doctor. “Oh, my boyfriend went to Harvard and he’s so proud of it he never takes off his Harvard sweatshirt, even when we make love,” she replies.</p>
<p>A couple of days later, another girl comes in for a checkup.

<p>A very rich man had a son. He was very proud of his son. The son was smart and diligent and did well in school.</p>
<p>On the son’s 16th birthday, the father went to his son and said “son, you are the apple of my eye and I’m very proud of you. I am a very rich man and since you have made me so proud I will buy you ANYTHING you ask me to buy you for your 16th birthday.”</p>
<p>The son, without hesitation, asked his father for 1,000 green golf balls.</p>
<p>The father was taken aback. “But son, that’s such a strange request! Might I remind you that I’m VERY rich, and I could buy you ANYTHING your heart desires?!”</p>
<p>But the son was adamant, and his father, though confused, honored his son’s request.</p>
<p>Some years later the son graduated from college at the top of his class. His father, once again beaming with pride, came to his son.</p>
<p>“Son, you are the apple of my eye and I’m very proud of you. I am a very rich man and since you have made me so proud I will buy you ANYTHING you ask me to buy you for your college graduation.”</p>
<p>The son, without hesitation, asked his father for 2,000 green golf balls.</p>
<p>The father once again was confused, and a bit angry.</p>
<p>“Son, that’s a ridiculous request! I’m offering to buy you ANYTHING you want! I’m a very rich man, and almost NOTHING is beyond my requisition! So please, reconsider, and tell me what you REALLY want!”</p>
<p>But the son was adamant, and his father, though bewildered and frustrated, honored his son’s request.</p>
<p>Years later, the son, following in his father’s footsteps, was a very successful businessman. He’d married a beautiful wife and borne his father many wonderful grandchildren.</p>
<p>One night as they ate dinner in an expensive restaurant, his father said to his son, “son, you are the apple of my eye and I’m very proud of you. I am a very rich man and since you have made me so proud I will buy you ANYTHING you ask me to buy you in honor of your fantastic success and wonderful family.”</p>
<p>Once again without blinking his son asked for 3,000 green golf balls.</p>
<p>Enraged, his father slammed his hands on the table and yelled, “WHY MUST YOU MOCK MY GENEROSITY SO?! FINE; YOU’LL HAVE YOUR STUPID GOLF BALLS, BUT YOU HAVE LOST YOURSELF A FATHER!”</p>
<p>And so the trade was made; the son’s strange request for the animosity of his once-doting father.</p>
<p>Several years later, the father and the son not having spoken once since, the father got a call from a hospital informing him that his son had gotten into a terrible car accident and was dying. Forgetting all about his grudge against his son, the father flew down to his son’s side in a flash. His son was conscious for the first time in days as his father arrived.</p>
<p>“Son, you are the apple of my eye and I’m very proud of you. I’m so sorry for disowning you! I know I never should have! I’m so sorry for the years we’ve lost! But I must know, son, why did you want all those green golfballs; those wretched orbs that drove us apart?! Surely you had a grand design for them; you’re the perfect son and I could not have asked for anything more in the world than you!”</p>
<p>His son, on death’s door, looked into his father’s eyes and said weakly, “well, father, I-”</p>
<p>And then he died.</p>

<p>Why is the sky blue?</p>
<p>Light is made up of electromagnetic waves. The distance between 2 crests in this wave is called the wavelength. White light contains all the colors of the rainbow. The amount of light scattered for any given colour depends on the wavelength of that colour. All the colors in white light have different wavelengths. Red light has the longest wavelength. The wavelength of blue light is about half that of red light. This difference in wavelength causes blue light to be scattered nearly ten times more than red light. Lord Rayleigh studied this phenomena in detail. It is caused the Tyndall effect or Rayleigh scattering. Lord Rayleigh also calculated that even without smoke and dust in the atmosphere, the oxygen and nitrogen molecules would still cause the sky to appear blue because of scattering. When blue light waves try to go straight through an oxygen and nitrogen molecules, its light is scattered in all directions because of this collision. This scattered blue light is what makes the sky blue. All other colors (with longer wavelengths than blue light) are scattered too. Blue light’s short wavelength causes it to be scattered the most. (The shorther the wavelength of the color, the more that color gets scattered by the atmosphere). Actually, violet has the shortest wavelength of all colors. Violet is scattered even more than blue light. However, our eyes are much more sensitive to see blue than violet, therefore we see the sky as blue. Very little visible light is absorbed by the atmosphere.</p>

        <p>[quote=“OnlyOneRule, post:1, topic:256555”]Paddy the Irishman is sitting in a pub one night when 3 Englishmen walked in.<br>
The men sit down, and start to talk about how they can anger the Irishman.<br>
The first man says, “Watch this.” He gets up, walks over to the Irishman, and says, “Hey Paddy, I hear your St. Patrick was a faggot.” The Irishman just replies, “Oh, is that so now?” The Englishman, goes back to his seat confused, when his friend jumps up and says, “Here, let me try that.”<br>
So he goes over to the Irishman and says, “Hey Paddy, I hear your St. Patrick was a transvestite faggot!” The Irishman only replies, “Oh, is that so now?” So the Englishman, frustrated goes and sits down with his friends.<br>
When the 3rd Englishman jumps up and says, “Well, now, I’ve got to try that!” So he walks over to the Irishman and says, “Hey Paddy, I hear your St. Patrick was an ENGLISHMAN!”<br>
The Irishman replies, “Aye, that’s what your friends were sayin.”[/quote]<br>

        <p>An Irish man was on a 747 one day, flying over the Pacific ocean when an engine cut out.<br>
“This is your captain speaking. One of our engines has cut out. Please do not worry, as the 747 is the safest plane in the world. We will be four hours late for landing.”<br>
An hour later, the second engine cut out.<br>
“This is your captain speaking. Another one of our engines has cut out. Please do not worry, as the 747 is the safest plane in the world. We will be eight hours late for landing.”<br>
An hour later, the third engine cut out.<br>
“This is your captain speaking. Another one of our engines has cut out. Please do not worry, as the 747 is the safest plane in the world. We will be twelve hours late for landing.”<br>
After about 30 minutes, the last engine cut out and the Irishman piped up “If it continues at this rate, we are going to be up here all year.”</p>
