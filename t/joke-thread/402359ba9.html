        <p>MORE!!!</p>
<hr>
<p>In the days of the Wild West, there was a young cowboy who wanted more<br>
than anything to be the greatest gunfighter in the world. He practiced<br>
every minute of his spare time, but he knew that he wasn’t yet<br>
first-rate and that there must be something he was doing wrong.</p>
<p>Sitting in a saloon one Saturday night, he recognized an elderly man<br>
seated at the bar that had the reputation of being the fastest gun in<br>
the West in his day.</p>
<p>The young cowboy took a seat next to the old-timer, bought him a drink,<br>
and told him the story of his great ambition. “Do you think you could<br>
give me some tips?” he asked.</p>
<p>The old man looked him up! and down and said, "Well, for one thing,<br>
you’re wearing your gun too high. Tie the holster a lil’ lower down on<br>
your leg.“Will that make me a better gunfighter?” asked the young man.<br>
“Sure will,” said the old-timer.</p>
<p>The young man did as he was told, stood up, whipped out his .44 and shot<br>
the bow tie off the piano player. “That’s terrific!” said the cowboy.<br>
“Got any more tips for me?” “Yep,” said the old man. “Cut a notch out of<br>
your holster where the hammer hits it. That’ll give you a smoother<br>
draw.” “Will that make me a better gunfighter?” asked the younger man.<br>
“You bet it will,” said the old-timer. The young man took out his knife,<br>
cut the notch, stood up, drew his gun in a blur, then shot a cufflink<br>
off the piano player. “Wow!” said the cowboy. “I’m learning’ somethin’<br>
here. Got any more tips?”</p>
<p>The old man pointed to a large can in a corner of the saloon. “See that<br>
axlegrease over there? Coat your gun with it.” The young man went over !<br>
to the can and smeared some of the grease on the barrel of his gun.<br>
“No,” said the old-timer, “I mean smear it all over the gun, handle and<br>
all.” “Will that make me a better gunfighter?” asked the young man.</p>
<p>“No,” said the old-timer, "but when Wyatt Earp gets done playing the<br>
Piano, he’s going to shove that gun up your ass and it won’t hurt as<br>
much.</p>

<p>Actual dialogue of a former WordPerfect Customer Support employee with a caller:</p>
<p>“Ridge Hall computer assistant; may I help you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, well, I’m having trouble with WordPerfect.”</p>
<p>“What sort of trouble?”</p>
<p>“Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went away.”</p>
<p>“Went away?”</p>
<p>“They disappeared.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. So what does your screen look like now?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“Nothing?”</p>
<p>“It’s blank; it won’t accept anything when I type.”</p>
<p>“Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?”</p>
<p>“How do I tell?”</p>
<p>“Can you see the C: prompt on the screen?”</p>
<p>“What’s a sea-prompt?”</p>
<p>“Never mind. Can you move the cursor around on the screen?”</p>
<p>“There isn’t any cursor, I told you, it won’t accept anything I type.”</p>
<p>“Does your monitor have a power indicator?”</p>
<p>“What’s a monitor?”</p>
<p>“It’s the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV. Does it have a little light that tells you when it’s on?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power cord goes into it. Can you see that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p>
<p>“Great. Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it’s plugged into the wall.”</p>
<p>“…Yes, it is.”</p>
<p>“When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two cables plugged into the back of it, not just one?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the other cable.”</p>
<p>“…Okay, here it is.”</p>
<p>“Follow it for me, and tell me if it’s plugged securely into the back of your computer.”</p>
<p>“I can’t reach.”</p>
<p>“Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s not because I don’t have the right angle - it’s because it’s dark.”</p>
<p>“Dark?”</p>
<p>“Yes - the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from the window.”</p>
<p>“Well, turn on the office light then.”</p>
<p>“I can’t.”</p>
<p>“No? Why not?”</p>
<p>“Because there’s a power outage.”</p>
<p>“A power… A power outage? Ah, Okay, we’ve got it licked now. Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, I keep them in the closet.”</p>
<p>“Good. Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from.”</p>
<p>“Really? Is it that bad?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m afraid it is.”</p>
<p>“Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?”</p>
<p>“Tell them you’re too stupid to own a computer.”</p>

<p>Two Alabama State Trooper Patrol cars were in hot pursuit of a Camaro heading east towards Georgia on I-90.</p>
<p>When the suspect crossed the Georgia line, the first trooper pulled over immediately. The rookie Trooper pulled over right behind him and asked, “Sarge, why’d you stop?”</p>
<p>“You dumb rookie,” replied the Sarge. “He’s in Georgia now. They’re an hour ahead of us, so we’ll never catch him.”</p>

        <p>[quote=“1963328, post:46, topic:40235”]Actual dialogue of a former WordPerfect Customer Support employee with a caller:</p>
<p>“Ridge Hall computer assistant; may I help you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, well, I’m having trouble with WordPerfect.”</p>
<p>“What sort of trouble?”</p>
<p>“Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went away.”</p>
<p>“Went away?”</p>
<p>“They disappeared.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. So what does your screen look like now?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“Nothing?”</p>
<p>“It’s blank; it won’t accept anything when I type.”</p>
<p>“Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?”</p>
<p>“How do I tell?”</p>
<p>“Can you see the C: prompt on the screen?”</p>
<p>“What’s a sea-prompt?”</p>
<p>“Never mind. Can you move the cursor around on the screen?”</p>
<p>“There isn’t any cursor, I told you, it won’t accept anything I type.”</p>
<p>“Does your monitor have a power indicator?”</p>
<p>“What’s a monitor?”</p>
<p>“It’s the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV. Does it have a little light that tells you when it’s on?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power cord goes into it. Can you see that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p>
<p>“Great. Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it’s plugged into the wall.”</p>
<p>“…Yes, it is.”</p>
<p>“When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two cables plugged into the back of it, not just one?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the other cable.”</p>
<p>“…Okay, here it is.”</p>
<p>“Follow it for me, and tell me if it’s plugged securely into the back of your computer.”</p>
<p>“I can’t reach.”</p>
<p>“Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s not because I don’t have the right angle - it’s because it’s dark.”</p>
<p>“Dark?”</p>
<p>“Yes - the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from the window.”</p>
<p>“Well, turn on the office light then.”</p>
<p>“I can’t.”</p>
<p>“No? Why not?”</p>
<p>“Because there’s a power outage.”</p>
<p>“A power… A power outage? Ah, Okay, we’ve got it licked now. Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, I keep them in the closet.”</p>
<p>“Good. Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from.”</p>
<p>“Really? Is it that bad?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m afraid it is.”</p>
<p>“Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?”</p>
<p>“Tell them you’re too stupid to own a computer.”[/quote]</p>

<p>Saddam Hussein and George W. Bush meet in Baghdad for the first round of talks in a new peace process. When George sits down, he notices three buttons on the side of Saddam’s chair. They begin talking. After about five minutes Saddam presses the first button. A boxing glove springs out of a box on the desk and punches Bush in the face. Confused, Bush carries on talking as Saddam laughs. A few minutes later the second button is pressed. This time a big boot comes out and kicks Bush in the shin. Again Saddam laughs, and again Bush carries on talking. But when the third button is pressed and another boot comes out and kicks Bush in the privates, he’s finally had enough, “I’m going back home!” he tells the Iraqi. “We’ll finish these talks in two weeks!”</p>
<p>Two weeks later Saddam flies to the United States for talks. As the two men sit down, Hussein notices three buttons on Bush’s chair and prepares himself for the Yank’s revenge. They begin talking and George presses the first button. Saddam ducks, but nothing happens. Bush snickers. A few seconds later he presses the second button. Saddam jumps up, but again nothing happens. Bush roars with laughter. When the third button is pressed, Saddam jumps up again, and again nothing happens. Bush falls on the floor in a fit of hysterics.</p>
<p>“Forget this,” says Saddam. “I’m going back to Baghdad!”</p>
<p>Bush says through tears of laughter, “What Baghdad?”</p>
<hr>
<p>A few days before Christmas, a man enters a pet store looking for a unique gift for his wife. The store manager tells him he has just what he’s looking for! A beautiful parrot named Chet that sings Christmas carols.</p>
<p>He brings the husband over to a colorful but quiet bird. The man agrees that Chet certainly is pretty, but he doesn’t seem to be much for singing. The manager tells him to watch as he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter. The manager then clicks the lighter and holds it under Chet’s left foot. Immediately Chet starts singing; “Silent Night, Holy Night.”</p>
<p>The husband is very impressed with Chet’s singing abilities and watches as the manager moves the lighter underneath Chet’s right foot. Chet now starts to sing “Jingle Bells, Jingle All the Way.” The husband says Chet is perfect and that he’ll take him.</p>
<p>The husband rushes home to his wife and insists upon giving her this wonderful gift immediately. He presents Chet and starts to explain the parrot’s special talent.</p>
<p>Demonstrating, he holds a lighter under Chet’s left foot and the bird sings “Silent Night.” He then moves the lighter under the right foot and Chet lets loose a round of “Jingle Bells.” The wife is absolutely impressed, and with a mischievous grin asks her husband what happens if he holds the lighter between Chet’s legs instead. Curious the husband moves the lighter between the bird’s legs, and the bird begins to sing - Chet’s nuts Roasting on an Open Fire!</p>

<p>A lonely frog telephoned the Psychic Hotline and asked what his future holds. His Personal Psychic Advisor tells him: “You are going to meet a beautiful young girl who will want to know everything about you.” The frog is thrilled, "This is great! “Will I meet her at a party?” he croaks. “No,” says the psychic, “in biology class.”</p>

        <p>One particular Christmas season a long time ago, Santa was getting ready for his annual trip … but there were problems everywhere.<br>
Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule. Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit.<br>
This stressed Santa even more. When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where. More stress. Then when he began to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys. Needless to say Santa wasn’t in the best mood.<br>
Just then the doorbell rang and Santa went to the door expecting another problem. He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas tree there just to cheer Santa up.<br>
The angel said, very cheerfully, “Merry Christmas Santa. Isn’t it just a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Isn’t it just a lovely tree? Where would you like me to stick it?”<br>
Thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the Christmas tree.</p>

<p>There was this guy who liked to hit lawyers with his car. One day he saw a priest who’s car was broken down on side of the road, so to be nice he decided to give him a ride. They were driving and the man saw a lawyer, so he instinctively went to hit him, then he thought “Oh my gosh I have a priest in my car.” So the man swerved out of the way of the lawyer. At the same time the priest opened the door.</p>
<p>Then the man said, “I’m so sorry, I almost hit a lawyer.”</p>
<p>And the priest said, “That’s O.K. I got him with the door.”</p>
<hr>
<p>A man walks into a bar and orders a beer. The barman charges him 10 cents. Confused, but not complaining, the man pays.<br>
After a while he decides to have another, and some food, so he orders another beer and a steak. The barman charges him 25 cents, 10 for the beer and 15 for the food.<br>
After finishing his food and drink, he calls the barman over and says, “Mate, that was the best steak I’ve ever had. I want to talk to the manager and thank him.”<br>
“No problem,” says the barman. “He’s upstairs with my wife.” “What’s he doing upstairs with your wife?” asks the man.<br>
“Probably the same thing I’m doing to his business down here!”</p>
<hr>
<p>A burglar found a prime neighborhood with nice houses and lots of older people who would be gone to Florida for the winter. He watches a particular house for several days before deciding that it would be safe to hit. It was pitch black inside as he made his way through the kitchen, then the dining room and into the den where he expected to find the things he wanted to steal.</p>
<p>“I see you and Jesus sees you,” a voice said.</p>
<p>The burglar froze in his tracks. Then he heard it again, “I see you and Jesus sees you.”</p>
<p>When nothing more happened, the burglar took out his flashlight and shinned it in the direction of the voice. All he saw was a parrot on its perch. “I see you and Jesus sees you.” the Parrot said.</p>
<p>The burglar laughed.</p>
<p>“Just a dumb bird,” he said.</p>
<p>The Parrot nodded towards the floor and responded, “I am a dumb parrot, Jesus is a Doberman pincher.”</p>
<hr>
<p>On the outskirts of town, there was a huge nut tree by the cemetery fence. One day two boys filled up a bucket with nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts. “One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me,” said one boy. The bucket was so full, several rolled out toward the fence at the edge of the cemetery. Cycling down the road by the cemetery was a third boy. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate.<br>
Sure enough, he heard, “One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.” He knew what it was. He shuddered. It’s Satan and St. Peter dividing the souls at the cemetery. He cycled down the road as fast as he could and found an old man hobbling along with a cane. He convinced the man to hobble back to the cemetery to hear the devil and St. Peter. Standing by the fence, they heard, “One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.”<br>
The old man whispered, “Boy, you’ve been telling the truth. Let’s find out if we can see the devil himself.” Shivering with fear, they peered through the fence, but they were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought-iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of Satan.<br>
At last they heard, “One for you, one for me. And one last one for you. That’s all. Now let’s go get those nuts by the fence, and we’ll be done.” They say the old guy made it back to town five minutes before the boy.</p>
<hr>
<p>On Christmas morning a cop on horseback is sitting at a traffic light, and next to him is a kid on his shiny new bike. The cop says to the kid, “Nice bike you got there. Did Santa bring that to you?”<br>
The Kid says, “Yeah.”<br>
The cop says, “Well, next year tell Santa to put a tail-light on that bike.” The cop then proceeds to issue the kid a $20.00 bicycle safety violation ticket.<br>
The kid takes the ticket and before he rides off says, “By the way, that’s a nice horse you got there. Did Santa bring that to you?”<br>
Humoring the kid, the cop says, “Yeah, he sure did.”<br>
The kid says, “Well, next year tell Santa to put the dick underneath the horse, instead of on top.”</p>
