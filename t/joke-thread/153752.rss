[b]Adam And Eve[/b]
Once upon a time there was a girl named emily,
Emily was not very bright and particularly hated religion
One day when Emily was sitting in religion class day-dreaming
the teacher asked here a question:
&quot;Who is our savior?&quot;
Emily had not heard her and didnt say anything until billy who was
an annoying little boy pocked her in the back with a stick so emily shouted
&quot;Jesus Christ&quot;
&quot;just as well you know that&quot; replied the teacher
10 miniutes passed and emily started day dreaming again so
the teacher asked
Who is our father?
once again billy pocked her in the back so she screamed
&quot;GOD!!&quot; 
&quot;good job emily i see your learning something&quot; the teacher replied
10 miniutes passed
the teacher knew Emily was day-dreaming once again so she asked
&quot;what did eve say to adam after their 21st child?&quot;
again billy pocked her so emily shouted at the top of her voice
&quot;IF YOU STICK THAT THING INTO ME ONE MORE TIME IM GOING TO BREAK IN HALF!!!!!!&quot;
