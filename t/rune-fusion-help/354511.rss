          <blockquote>
              <p>Commands are the easiest in servers, im guessing Rune-Fusion is a 317 so first off head to client.java in your source/server files and search for:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">command.</code></pre>
<p>If i search that, it will first appear with:</p>
<p><code>if (command.startsWith("brunes") &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt; 1)) {
addItem(555, 6000);
addItem(565, 2000);
addItem(560, 4000);
savegame(true);
}</code></p>
<p>If it doesn’t appear with something like that, keep searching until it does. It doesn’t have to be exactly like mine. Firstly the command name is “brunes”, what a player types to use the command (::brunes)</p>
<p>With this command, it will add barrage runes to the players inventory, but only if their rights equal 1 or is more than one.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt; 1)) {</code></pre>
<p>The items appear in the player’s inventory.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">addItem(555, 6000);</code></pre>
<p>The “555” is the item id, the “6000” is the quantity. You can find item id’s online and you can pick a quantity. Because these runes are stackable, i cant put them in note form. If you want to give a player, say, 1000 sharks you will have to find the item id for the noted form (usually if sharks were to be 444 then the noted id would be 445).</p>
<p>Keep searching through the commands, you can easily work out which some of them mean. Another cool one is this:</p>
<p><code>if (command.startsWith("staffzone") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1) {
toX = 2008;
toY = 4438;
heightLevel = 0;
sM("You teleport to the staffzone");</code></p>
<p>Teleports to the coordinates 2208, 4438 and sends the message “you teleport to the staffzone”, but only the player who used the comand can see the message.</p>
