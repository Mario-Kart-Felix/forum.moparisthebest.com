    <title>Object clicked</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/object-clicked/420591</link>
    <description>Firstly I&#39;d like to establish, I&#39;m very new to clients and they seem very strange to me, but I&#39;m trying to get better at them! :)

I was wondering if there was some sort of way to make the &quot;add a friend&quot; interface show when a certain object is clicked. Originally I thought this would be server-sided, but the opening of the text input interfaces is client-sided. So I was wondering if anyone could tell me some way to open this interface when a particular object within the server is clicked.

All help is appreciated.

 Thank you :)</description>
