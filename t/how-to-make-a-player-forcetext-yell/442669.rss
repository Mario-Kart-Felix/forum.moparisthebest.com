    <title>How to make a Player ForceText Yell</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-player-forcetext-yell/442669</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to get a player to yell as if a NPC would, I&#39;m trying to make a command for it, And for them only to yell it once.
I&#39;d like 2 different commands for a player to yell it and For a owner make another player yell it..

Example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;  
  if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;falcopunch&quot;)) {
			c.forcedText = (&quot;FALCO PUNCH!!&quot;);
		    }&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And it doesn&#39;t seem to work in-game? It compiles fine.. But my player does nothing..</description>

I think he needs to update the required action before it appears to the client, like so (whatever their update method is):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase("falcopunch")) {
         c.forcedText = ("FALCO PUNCH!!");
         c.updateRequired = true;
}  </code></pre>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>no, all your code does is this</p>
<p>if player command  - string command to use is "blah "<br>
forcedtext  - will go to method for  forcedtext which tells the player to say whatever the  string commands<br>
updaterequired - requires it to update  something…not sure what never really looked at it ~^</p>
<p>it has to loop somehow…</p>
<p>without telling it to  go   all out to all players  it would have to be specific to a  rank or to a  person.[/quote]<br>
Oh I see what you’re saying now. I assumed that without it, it would just force the text for the player doing the command. I was right about the updateRequired = true; though, as I’ve already learned from that mistake, hehe.</p>
