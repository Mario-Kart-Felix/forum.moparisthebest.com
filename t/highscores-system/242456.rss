    <title>Highscores system</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/highscores-system/242456</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to add in a Highscores system for my players, I&#39;m not talking about an in-game highscores system I&#39;m talking about one that I can place on my website. Can anybody help me/direct me towards a place that can help me create one of these? My players like to be competitive and I think that adding in a Highscores system to my website would be great. Help is greatly appreciated.</description>
