    <title>EasyRSC - editing ItemLoc.xml file -&gt; error compiling</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/easyrsc-editing-itemloc-xml-file-error-compiling/515791</link>
    <description>First of all, I ain&#39;t coder or trying to become one. Im just trying to remind good old days playing rsc with few friends.


OK,
everything works with fine when I won&#39;t edit anything. So I go to conf - server - locs and open up itemloc.xml with notepad. I didn&#39;t add any new lines, just edited ID values and coords. I added 6 new items to edgeville - they are first item x - 219 y - 455, second item x - 218 y - 455 etc. 
Next I deleted compressed ItemLoc.xml.gz, right click on ItemLoc.xml file and compress(using winrar), I changed also ItemLoc.xml.gz (as all other compressed files on Locs folder) and copy/pasted it into Locs folder(same places as all others).

It seems to compile well ...BUT, when I run server, it gives me error and won&#39;t open GUI.

Any ideas? What should I try?

-Desty.



Figured it out.

Winrar didn&#39;t compress it correctly. I downloaded 7z and now compiles and runs successfully.
Thank you.</description>
