    <title>How did you get into rsps?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-did-you-get-into-rsps/284817</link>
    <description>There was this 1 game called ElementEvil and i heard that u could get similar server and make a game like it, so i was wondering if the same would be for runescape.
I googled runescape server and found WorldScape by Ry60003333 :) Then i found moparscape status page and i saw that he wasn&#39;t the only one with a server, then i found out about the forum and found lots of sources and here i am now.
What about you guys?  :rolleyes:</description>

              <p>I was looking around for ways to cheat on rs (i was 10 and couldnt read the homepage which said: NO RUNESCAPE CHEATS EXIST ect.) so i found a server called something like static-legion or w/e i played it a while, my friend IRL joined to. I then started duping and thought the server was ballshit when it shut down. I googled what they called rsps at the time ‘moparskup serbas’ on google and somehow ended up here.</p>
<p>Long Story Short: it took me a week to learn how to register.</p>

              <p>Funny thing, I could have actually been here before any of you. When I used to play runescape there was always people advertising private server development in lumbridge. So I decided to check it out for once. I googled private servers and there was a moparscape tutorial. At the time, I had no idea how to use a forum. When I first saw moparscape  there were so little members, probably not even 200~ registered. I failed at setting up my own private server so I gave up and abandoned it all together.</p>
<p>A few years later, my friend Kollin showed me “cheaters runescape” (so he called it). I checked it out and said “wait… this is a private server, I’ve seen youtube videos.” Later I went on my first rsps called DXScape. The admin there Rocky1013 or something said he had his own private server and wanted me to be admin. I got to talking to him and he showed me moparscape once again and there I learned how to make my own private server ^-^.</p>
<p>Sort of long, but I guess it’s necessary.</p>

              <p>Ok heres how i got into rsps.</p>
<p>Around December 2006 i think i was at my cousions house playing rs. He told me about this thing called moparscape where you can make cash quick and level easly. So we loaded mopar scape and pressed new server [thinking this would let us play] but it didnt so we gave up and played rs more.</p>
<p>In June 2009 i was planning to make more cash on rs doing godwars so i fougth mabye if i go and try and play moparscape again i could use it for a godwars simulator[thinking it was a exact copy of rs] I then figured out that u have to type in some ones ip to play and i started playing a server called final barrage.</p>
<p>I then played that server and started getting addicted to rsps. I started spending mroe time on rsps then on rs and then started only playing rs 4 5 minutes once a week. I then wondered how you make your own server and googled it. i found a few tuts on how to make one and followed them.</p>
<p>I then couldent figure out how to edit the server so i asked the co owner of final barrage how to. he tryed his best to teach me some basics on coding and i got everything right but didnt know that i ahd 2 compile after… rofl… I then teamed up with the co owner of my current server and he showed me more stuff on how to code. I then started picking up things myself and even teaching my co owner new things.</p>
<p>I then made my own server [the other server that i had the co owner coded it] and started coding it myself. i am still in the process of coding it and am almost done  :)[look at my sig for progress] And thats how i got into rsps <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
