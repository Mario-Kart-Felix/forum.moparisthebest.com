    <description>hello,

        i&#39;ve recently been trying to get on my server and i can get on fine, but i keep thinking huh? how come no-ones on... then my friend told me he couldn&#39;t get on/trying for like 10 minutes. These are the programmes i&#39;ve run... no-ip-----himachi-----source----compiler------runserver-----mopar.... and i logged on.. but none of my friends could. can someone please help me?

If i have done something wrong someone tell me please ( i dont think i have ) i do this process all the time. my server was on yesterday.

my internet is connected properly... so someone tell me plz.

i know u might be thinking &quot; omg wot a noob &quot; but... if someone fixes my problem then there is a 500k reward.</description>
