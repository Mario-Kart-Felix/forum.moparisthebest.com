    <description>Tutorial-some basic functions



Ok we need some more scripters and im a begginer but hopefully this will get you interest 

note:this tutorial is nothing compared to the great kaitnetick(RIP) tutorials 

Okay lets start with some basic functions of scar

So when you open scar you see this on your screen

program New;
begin
end.

ok so lets break this down.The &quot;Program New&quot; is pretty much from my knowledge just the name of the script and by changing the new you can name your script eg

program Autominer;
begin
end.

Okay know the &quot;begin&quot; part, this is important all your code goes after this.

The &quot;end.&quot; this pretty much just ends your script, simple....



okay now for some basic functions 

rembering from above we eneter all our code after the &quot;begin&quot; part of our script.

here are the basic functions i know

movemouse(x,y);
movemousesmooth(x,y,); //moves more human like
clickmouse(x,y,true/false);
sendkeys(&#39;&#39;)

ok so lets brake it down again

for the movemouse function you substitute the &quot;x,y&quot; for corodinates, to get corordinates just use your color picker and the corodiantes will appear at the bottom of scar box in the debug box.eg

movemousesmooth(234,775,true);

rember:scar follows a certain way you have to write things.on almost every command you need a &quot;;&quot; to show tht that is the end of that single command.

the numbers are coridantes, the &quot;true&quot; means that scar will left click and if you had put &quot;false&quot; it would have right clicked.

heres a full example

program New;
begin
movemousesmooth(234,775,true);
end.

for the movmousesmooth fuction just do the same but don&#39;t add the true or false eg

program New;
begin
movemousesmooth(255,775);
end.


ok now for sendkeys function,this will type whatever you wrote into whatever your cursor is on in text applications(like notepad,microsoft word etc...)you just wrote what i wrote up the top and input your string(letters)eg

sendkeys(&#39;hi traitors&#39;);

rember the &quot;;&quot; at the end

and it will write that 

heres a full example

program New;
begin
sendkeys(&#39;hi traitors&#39;);
end.

hope it helps more coming soon
