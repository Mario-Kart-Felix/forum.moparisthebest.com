    <title>Sound Engine - rate the quality</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sound-engine-rate-the-quality/415199</link>
    <description>I have been working on a small sound engine written in Java. The engine (right now) has absolutely no GUI and takes all pattern, timing, SPC file to load from a txt file currently. This was mearly a text to get how well the engine could mashup the sounds right now. I just put in random values and got an outcome. This engine is FAR from done so please do [b]not[/b] ask for sample code or anything.

Anyways, without further dissapointment. I present to you a link to the sound. I don&#39;t think it was all that bad for just writing in random values.

As soon as I get the components programmed and a simple GUI made I will post a development thread.</p>

              <p>I can’t use it right now due to being in a public place, but I am definitely gonna look into this later. I’ve been really interested in studying instrumentation synthesizing and sampling and such, but it has always been an elusively difficult subject for me. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I wish you the best of luck with this project.</p>

              <p>Thanks,  over the next few days I will be getting the timing issues down. Not sure if anybody noticed the beginning is a bit off. As well as some things cut out early.  This was not a error in my txt file as I don’t have sound stopping written in yet. It is supposed to play that whole simple then stop.</p>
<p>Anyways how’s the quality of its output?  I have shitty earphones or I would be able to tell if it was good or bad.</p>
