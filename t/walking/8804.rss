<p>It’s not that hard.</p>
<p>Just using the walking procedures in SRL. Then detecting your whereabouts with colors/dtms and continue on from there. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>There used to be scripts that went from the air altar or the rimmington mine to the bank by clicking on the northern most point that it found the color of the road, until it saw the bank. This worked ok-ish until the road color in falador was made different to road color outside. What makes them unreliable, is that they don’t check where they are by using landmarks. Whichever method you use, make sure you use checks. Having a way to fix getting lost is better than trying to never get lost, if you know what I mean.</p>

              <p>there are 2 ways, ill go over them simply, most walkers use them in conjuction (this is at least how i do it :)) first, you can use coords, and you clickmouse to click on the minimap to go where you want, this can be VERY unreliable for many obvious reasons, seconds, must more reliable is you symbols (rare tree, water, etc) on the minimap, and either use bitmaps, or just colors to have the script find it on the bitmap, and and click it (god i loved aryan, so easy to walk, it had coords you just typed in :P)</p>
