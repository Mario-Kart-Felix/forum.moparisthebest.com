    <title>Hyperion Chat Seems a bit Sluggish?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hyperion-chat-seems-a-bit-sluggish/545397</link>
    <description>Hello all,

I am attempting to use the Hyperion base for rsps. The chat seems a bit...delayed...When One types something into the chat then presses enter, it seems about a second later it appears on the chatbox, it was unlike this when I tried typing in a blank delta.Everything else seems to be working at a &#39;normal&#39; pace. Is there a fix for this?


                                                                                                                                                 Thanks


Sorry about all the questions lately, Im trying to get used to Hyperion.</description>

              <p>it could be that it queues the chat message for the next tick instead of immediately sending it to the clients</p>
<p>haven’t actually checked it though</p>
