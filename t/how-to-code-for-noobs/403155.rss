Coding For Beginners
Step 1.
Changing name of a server to your name, First you will have to find the name of the server. Say if the name is KillerVille then find KillerVille, if nothing comes up then go into client.java and find killerville or the name of the server, you will then change the name of the server to the name of your server
Step 2.
Auto spawn? To spawn items on a delta or czar you must go into the autospawn.cfg. Once there you can add npcs. If there have never been npcs in there before the code would be.
Code: [Select]spawn = npc id        cord x        cord y        0        0        0        0        0        2 the rest you can leave alone for beginng thats for moving npcs around and stuff
Step 3.
Getting you server online. This bring up a lot of questions to a lot of people so I made a tutorial on youtube, here is the link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdMXrxhvz30
Yes i am jjh3owns
Step 4.
Adding commands, adding commands can be tricky but no and days I just use voule&#39;s command generator but if you want to add commands like master it would be tricky.
Code: [Select] if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;master&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0)         {   addSkillXP(14910000, 0);    addSkillXP(14910000, 1);    addSkillXP(14910000, 2);    addSkillXP(14910000, 3);    addSkillXP(14910000, 4);    addSkillXP(14910000, 5);    addSkillXP(14910000, 6);    addSkillXP(14910000, 7);    addSkillXP(14910000, 8);    addSkillXP(14910000, 9);    addSkillXP(14910000, 10);    addSkillXP(14910000, 11);   addSkillXP(14910000, 12);    addSkillXP(14910000, 13);    addSkillXP(14910000, 14);    addSkillXP(14910000, 15);    addSkillXP(14910000, 16);    addSkillXP(14910000, 17);    addSkillXP(14910000, 18);    addSkillXP(14910000, 19);    addSkillXP(14910000, 20);    addSkillXP(14910000, 21);    addSkillXP(14910000, 22);   addSkillXP(14910000, 23);    sendMessage(&quot;Master of everything&quot;); }that would be the code for master if you want to make it for mods or admins+ then change the player rights to 1-2-3. when it says add skillxp and then in parenthises thats the amount of xp it adds then where the numbers are like 23 22 and 21 those are the skill numbers.
Step 5.
Shops! Shops in my example are very hard well kinda lol. If you want to make a shop that&#39;s already a shop and you just want to add items thats not very hard. You go into shops.cfg and if you see the shop you want to edit add this code: 
Code: [Select](item id)        (amount of item) Ex. 15027   10000
Adding shops to delta are hard to explain so go to this link: http://forum.ragezone.com/f365/317-creating-shops-438318/
Step 6.
Prices, prices on items can be easy or hard. depending on how you approch them. Say you have D claws as 1m and the item id is 8002. So i want to make them 500m. I look in my prices.java and find it as 1m so I change it to price. If you search the price and don&#39;t know item id you might get it wrong. If the item id and price aren&#39;t in there you can add them so it would look like this: Before 
Code: [Select]8002 1000000 After: 
Code: [Select]8002 500000000 Very simple when you get used to it!
Step 7.
Objects! Not made by me. If You Want To Delete Or Add New Global Objects Then You Should Open Your Client.java file. This Will Only Work If Your Server Already Has Global Objects Added, Which All Newly Posted Servers Should Have. Hit Ctrl + F And Find This;
Code:

Code: [Select]NewObjects() {Under This You Should See One Of These Two;Code:
          
Code: [Select]makeGlobalObject(XXXX, YYYY, ID, DIRECTION, 10)Code:
          
Code: [Select]addGlobalObject(XXXX, YYYY, ID, DIRECTION, 10)Example;
Code:
         
Code: [Select] makeGlobalObject(2853, 3348, 6552, -1, 10);//altarExplenation;
Code:

Code: [Select](XXXX, YYYYThese Are Simply Just The X and Y Coordinates Of Where You Want Your Globalobject To Be Placed.
Code:

Code: [Select], ID,Go Find The ID Of The Object You Want To Add And Put It In Here.
Code:

Code: [Select], DIRECTION,This will determine which way your object will face. 
Code:

Code: [Select]10)This tells you what the thing you are adding, if your only adding Objects Then DO NOT change it otherwise it wont work. 

----- Deleting Objects -----
To Delete Global Objects Go Into Client.java, Hit Ctrl + F And Search For This
Code:

Code: [Select]Deleteobjects() {Then Scroll Down And You Should See Something Like This
Code:
            
Code: [Select]deletethatobject(2785, 3175); //plantThis Is Much Simpler Than Adding Objects As All You Need To Do Is Enter The X &amp; Y Coordinates Of The Object You Want To Delete. NOTE: If You Delete An Object You Will Not Be Able To Place A New Object In The Position Of The Deleted Object, If You Want To Place A New Object Simply Add That Object As It Will Automatically Change The Object Thats In Its Place.

----- Item On Item -----
Item On Item Is Simply What It Is, You Use A Certain Item On Another Item And That Can Give Anything From Money, Any Other Item, Exp, Messages etc. Go Into Your Client.java (If Your Server Has A Text File With Item on Items Then Open That) And Under Any Command You Can Add This
Code:

Code: [Select]                                else if(itemUsed == 243 &amp;&amp; useWith == 233) {                                        deleteItem(243, getItemSlot(243), 1);                                        addItem(241, 1);                                }Explenation;
Code:
         
Code: [Select]else if(itemUsed == 243 &amp;&amp; useWith == 233) {This Is Just Telling Which Items Will Be Used Together. However, This Will Only Go One Way. You Will Need To Create Another One Of These If You Wanted The Item 233 To Be Used With Item 243. At This Time Only 243 Can Be Used With 233.
Code:
               
Code: [Select]deleteItem(243, getItemSlot(243),1);
This Is Telling You That When You Use The Two Items That The Item 243 Will Be Deleted From Your Inventory.
Code:
               
Code: [Select]addItem(241, 1);When You Use The Two Items Together You Will Receive The Item 241. If Your Wondering, I Used This For Herblore When Your Adding Herbs To The Vial Of Water.

This Is As Simple As It Gets, If You Want Anything Else You Should Try It On Your Own, All I Have Done Is Just Explained What Will Happen When You Use Two Items. You Can Also Add Messages, Requirements And Much More. Just So You Know What It Looks Like I Have Posted An Example Of A Much Complicated Item On Item Below:
Code:
            
Code: [Select]else if(itemUsed == 99 &amp;&amp; useWith == 231) {                                        if(playerLevel[15] &gt;= 28) {                                                deleteItem(99, getItemSlot(99), 1);                                                deleteItem(231, getItemSlot(231), 1);                                                addItem(139, 1);                                                addSkillXP(20000, 15);                                        } else {                                                sendMessage(&quot;You need a higher herblore level to make this potion.&quot;);                                        }
----- Item On Object -----
This Is Also Simple, You Use A Certain Item On A Certain Object And That Can Teleport You, Give You Items, Exp, Open Interfaces etc. First, Go Into Your Client.java, Hit Ctrl + F And Find This 
Code:

Code: [Select]+atObjectID+&quot; atObjectY: &quot;+atObjectY+&quot; itemSIF When You Searched For The Code Above And You Couldn&#39;t Find Anything Like It Then Try Find This
Code:

Code: [Select]atObjectID ==You Should Find Something Like This
Code:
  
Code: [Select]                              if (useItemID == ITEMID &amp;&amp; atObjectID == OBJECTID)                                {                                teleportToX = XXXX;                                teleportToY = YYYY;                                sendMessage(&quot;---- YOUR MESSAGE -----&quot;);                                sendMessage(&quot;---- YOUR MESSAGE 2 ---&quot;);                                }This Is A Simple Item On Object, Again, You Can Make It Much More Complex By Adding Things Such As Exp, Level Requirements etc. Its Telling You That When You Use That Item On That Object You Will Be Teleported And Then You Will Get Two Messages On Your Chat Box.


----- Cases for Objects -----
Cases Represent Objects That Work On Their Own i.e. Portals. Again, You Can Make A Case Very Simple By Adding Certain Messages Or Make It More Complicated. Go Into Your Client.java and Find This
Code:

Code: [Select]//QUEST_1 OBJECTSIf You Cannot Find It In Your Server Then Simply Find A Object That Makes You Do Something i.e. Haystacks And Search For Their Case. So Haystacks Would Be Case 300; Because The Object ID Of The Haystack Is 300.
Underneath What You have Just Found You Should See A Lot Of Cases, Find The Object ID You Want To Use (Make Sure The Object Is Usable) And Then Simply Name it &quot;Case OBJECTID;&quot;. Example;
Code:

Code: [Select]case 4499:break;You Should always add a &quot;break;&quot; to show that you are ending that code. Thats it, nothing is added yet so lets add a teleport to this case.
Code:

Code: [Select]case 4499:teleportToX = XXXX;teleportToY = YYYY;break;Code: [Select]This will teleport you to those coordinates when you click on that object. This is at its simplest and it can be used for a ladder or portal. I have coded in a custom castle wars minigame and i used cases for my portals. This is an example of what i coded.Code:case 4388: // zammy homeif (playerHasItem(4513) == true &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(4514) == true){sendMessage(&quot;You cannot enter with other god items.&quot;);sendMessage(&quot;They have been removed.&quot;);deleteItem(4513, getItemSlot(4513), 1);deleteItem(4514, getItemSlot(4514), 1);teleportToX = 2441;teleportToY = 3090;} else {if (playerEquipment[playerCape] == 4514 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerHat] == 4513) {sendMessage(&quot;You cannot enter with zammy items.&quot;);sendMessage(&quot;Please use the bankbooth and store them safely.&quot;);} else {if (playerEquipment[playerCape] == 4516 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerHat] == 4515) {teleportToX = 2422;teleportToY = 9526;sendMessage(&quot;You are teleported to the waiting arena.&quot;);sendMessage(&quot;Use the portal to begin castle wars.&quot;);} else {if (playerHasItem(4516) == true &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(4515) == true){sendMessage(&quot;Please put on your cape and hat.&quot;);} else {if (playerHasItem(4516) == false &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(4515) == false){addItem(4515, 1);addItem(4516, 1);sendMessage(&quot;You get your hat and cape.&quot;);}}}}}break;Feel free to use this, to explain what this does. If The Other Player Has The Opposing God Items On Or In Their Inventory They Will Be Removed. If The Player Does Not Have A Cape Or Hood They Will Get One And By Only Allowed To Enter If They Wear It. Like I Said You Can Add Anything To Cases .
Step 8.
Exprate this is just a little tut on this. go into client.java and ctrl+f search for exprate then click search twice and change the number you find such as 2000 or somthing to 4000  and keep doing that for the rest of them then compile.
Step 9.
Staff/and such, To make your self owner/admin/mod/donor you will find the charcters folder once in the you must find your name or the charcter you want to make a part of staff. Find the player rights and change to 1=mod 2=admin 3=owner 4=hidden admin 10=hidden owner. For donor you have to find somthing called: Isdonater or somthing like that. Change that from 0 to 1.



These where just some steps to start coding. The only reason I made this was because I had someone that kept asking questions and it was getting me angry lol.

<p>This Is As Simple As It Gets, If You Want Anything Else You Should Try It On Your Own, All I Have Done Is Just Explained What Will Happen When You Use Two Items. You Can Also Add Messages, Requirements And Much More. Just So You Know What It Looks Like I Have Posted An Example Of A Much Complicated Item On Item Below:<br>
Code:</p>
<p>Code: [Select]else if(itemUsed == 99 &amp;&amp; useWith == 231) {                                        if(playerLevel[15] &gt;= 28) {                                                deleteItem(99, getItemSlot(99), 1);                                                deleteItem(231, getItemSlot(231), 1);                                                addItem(139, 1);                                                addSkillXP(20000, 15);                                        } else {                                                sendMessage(“You need a higher herblore level to make this potion.”);                                        }<br>
----- Item On Object -----<br>
This Is Also Simple, You Use A Certain Item On A Certain Object And That Can Teleport You, Give You Items, Exp, Open Interfaces etc. First, Go Into Your Client.java, Hit Ctrl + F And Find This<br>
Code:</p>
<p>Code: [Select]+atObjectID+" atObjectY: “+atObjectY+” itemSIF When You Searched For The Code Above And You Couldn’t Find Anything Like It Then Try Find This<br>
Code:</p>
<p>Code: [Select]atObjectID ==You Should Find Something Like This<br>
Code:</p>
<p>Code: [Select]                              if (useItemID == ITEMID &amp;&amp; atObjectID == OBJECTID)                                {                                teleportToX = XXXX;                                teleportToY = YYYY;                                sendMessage("---- YOUR MESSAGE -----");                                sendMessage("---- YOUR MESSAGE 2 —");                                }This Is A Simple Item On Object, Again, You Can Make It Much More Complex By Adding Things Such As Exp, Level Requirements etc. Its Telling You That When You Use That Item On That Object You Will Be Teleported And Then You Will Get Two Messages On Your Chat Box.</p>
<p>----- Cases for Objects -----<br>
Cases Represent Objects That Work On Their Own i.e. Portals. Again, You Can Make A Case Very Simple By Adding Certain Messages Or Make It More Complicated. Go Into Your Client.java and Find This<br>
Code:</p>
<p>Code: [Select]//QUEST_1 OBJECTSIf You Cannot Find It In Your Server Then Simply Find A Object That Makes You Do Something i.e. Haystacks And Search For Their Case. So Haystacks Would Be Case 300; Because The Object ID Of The Haystack Is 300.<br>
Underneath What You have Just Found You Should See A Lot Of Cases, Find The Object ID You Want To Use (Make Sure The Object Is Usable) And Then Simply Name it “Case OBJECTID;”. Example;<br>
Code:</p>
<p>Code: [Select]case 4499:break;You Should always add a “break;” to show that you are ending that code. Thats it, nothing is added yet so lets add a teleport to this case.<br>
Code:</p>
<p>Code: [Select]case 4499:teleportToX = XXXX;teleportToY = YYYY;break;Code: [Select]This will teleport you to those coordinates when you click on that object. This is at its simplest and it can be used for a ladder or portal. I have coded in a custom castle wars minigame and i used cases for my portals. This is an example of what i coded.Code:case 4388: // zammy homeif (playerHasItem(4513) == true &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(4514) == true){sendMessage(“You cannot enter with other god items.”);sendMessage(“They have been removed.”);deleteItem(4513, getItemSlot(4513), 1);deleteItem(4514, getItemSlot(4514), 1);teleportToX = 2441;teleportToY = 3090;} else {if (playerEquipment[playerCape] == 4514 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerHat] == 4513) {sendMessage(“You cannot enter with zammy items.”);sendMessage(“Please use the bankbooth and store them safely.”);} else {if (playerEquipment[playerCape] == 4516 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerHat] == 4515) {teleportToX = 2422;teleportToY = 9526;sendMessage(“You are teleported to the waiting arena.”);sendMessage(“Use the portal to begin castle wars.”);} else {if (playerHasItem(4516) == true &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(4515) == true){sendMessage(“Please put on your cape and hat.”);} else {if (playerHasItem(4516) == false &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(4515) == false){addItem(4515, 1);addItem(4516, 1);sendMessage(“You get your hat and cape.”);}}}}}break;Feel free to use this, to explain what this does. If The Other Player Has The Opposing God Items On Or In Their Inventory They Will Be Removed. If The Player Does Not Have A Cape Or Hood They Will Get One And By Only Allowed To Enter If They Wear It. Like I Said You Can Add Anything To Cases .<br>
Step 8.<br>
Exprate this is just a little tut on this. go into client.java and ctrl+f search for exprate then click search twice and change the number you find such as 2000 or somthing to 4000  and keep doing that for the rest of them then compile.<br>
Step 9.<br>
Staff/and such, To make your self owner/admin/mod/donor you will find the charcters folder once in the you must find your name or the charcter you want to make a part of staff. Find the player rights and change to 1=mod 2=admin 3=owner 4=hidden admin 10=hidden owner. For donor you have to find somthing called: Isdonater or somthing like that. Change that from 0 to 1.</p>
<p>These where just some steps to start coding. The only reason I made this was because I had someone that kept asking questions and it was getting me angry lol.<br>
