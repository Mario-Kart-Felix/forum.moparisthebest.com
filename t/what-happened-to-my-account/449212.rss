    <title>What happened to my account?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-happened-to-my-account/449212</link>
    <description>I&#39;m assuming those chink motherfuckers did this to me but there&#39;s nothing to do about it now. I finally logged in after almost a year of not playing and find my account has again been hacked in my absence. It&#39;s happened about 3 times now and I can&#39;t figure out how they&#39;re doing it. The first time they botted my hunter cause I logged in after recovering it and had level 96 Hunter. Which I had like 45 when I quit playing. The second time it happened I recovered the account and found my bank pin was removed and some stuff sold, and it looked like they had been botting for dragon bones, but I still had my 140mil and some of my rare items. 

But this time... all my shit is gone, my members was removed, and I&#39;m in the middle of the fucking wilderness with dragon bones. I&#39;m not posting this to rant because that wouldn&#39;t accomplish anything. And I&#39;m not asking for a handout. But how the HELL do they keep doing this? I&#39;ve changed the recoveries, and I know I don&#39;t have any keyloggers. I&#39;m afraid to play the game because shit like this keeps happening. And I knew eventually my stuff was going to be taken. So any ideas? Also, they added a friend [#1C398P3J]</description>

              <p>It sounds like it was recovered, basically if you were signed up on ANY other Runescape forums (even old tip.it accounts), hackers have been injecting outdated Runescape forums which contain hashed passwords which then are cracked, and used to recover accounts (or simply login). With information from one site alone gives you - email, 1 previous password (1 is all that is req.), and possibly an Ip address.</p>

              <p>That friend indicates a deleted account lol. If anything, you’re fortunate that your account isn’t banned for botting.</p>
