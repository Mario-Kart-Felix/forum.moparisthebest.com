        <p>If you are anxious to eliminate your glasses as well as contacts, a new operative option may be the reply. It’s a corrective surgical procedure for nearsightedness that is similar to laser beam surgery, reports Surgeon Dr. Rose Gabriele of CBS News affiliate WOIO-TV in Cleveland.Intacs, which are inserted onto the non-seeing periphery with the cornea, were recently authorized by the Food and Drug Administration.The small diamond ring segments in the shape of half-circles are put on the edge of the particular cornea to change its condition, says Dr. Samuel Salamon of the Corrective Eye Middle in Cleveland. Patients are inserted with an anesthetic however remain awake from the surgery. Tiny cuts are made in the cornea to place the implants in every eye. The procedure will take approximately fifteen minutes.Studies show that most patients get 20/20 vision or greater with the implants. Nevertheless, unlike other helpful procedures, the enhancements can be removed.“We can remove the segments, we can modify them, we can substitute them,” states Salamon.Like most surgery, often there is a risk of troubles, including infection. The cost of the procedure is almost the same as eye surgery – about $2,200 for each eye.People that have mild to moderate nearsightedness may also benefit from the medical procedures.  <a href="http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutlet.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutlet.html</a><br>
The following is a every week 60 Minutes Wednesday commentary by columnist Charlie Hartman. Way below Neiman Marcus, below Filene’s basement, and even the particular Dollar Store – recorded on the very bottom step of our consumer-driven society – will be the American yard sale.We have always been fascinated by yard sales, specifically, the unmitigated gall associated with sellers.To think someone else would want their junk. Who would buy a person’s garbage and go on it home? Well, I actually do. I’ve never had the oppertunity to leave a sale empty-handed. I’m going to see an extra virgin olive oil bottle, and even though I have thrown away dozens just like it, at this moment … I’ll think, ‘What a deal.’" I couldn’t even resist the guy who had not even attempt to sell except Nine hundred used golf clubs. And I do not even golf. I just bought a putter out of pity. Good luck eliminating the other 899.Sellers say it’s the next best thing to be able to free money, and i also wanted in with this action. So I decided to have my own garage sale. I put up signs and almost immediately, unknown people started peeking in the house windows.Shopper: You’re using a sale today, can’t you be? Hartman: Yes, in an hour.Shopper: OK, I’ll come back.I never acquired stalkers before. This was thrilling already.My yard sale consisted mostly of things I found lying around a cubicle, like a macaroni and cheese box in the '96 Republican Convention, props coming from old stories and some boring personnel study materials (CBS News Criteria).Basically nothing I possibly could ever imagine anyone buying.And yet, the idea sold. The Velcro attended an art teacher, and somebody even ordered the autograph. Really the only factor I couldn’t unload was that stupid essential olive oil bottle. Hartman: It’s thicker glass, try to press that, you can’t break it. Shopper: He has been getting desperate currently. Pay for your turkey and let’s get out of here.In total, I manufactured $93, and I’m already focusing on my next selling.  <a href="http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutlet.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">gucci outlet store</a><br>
When the president met regarding his top generals and admirals Tuesday, the official subject ended up being the readiness with the America’s armed forces, accounts CBS News Countrywide Security Correspondent David Martin .However, lurking under the surface was the issue of whether Mister. Clinton can continue to lead your military. He is the commander-in-chief and he had a good adulterous affair with a girl who was the equivalent of a money private, and then he lied about it. From the military he would become relieved of his / her command and probably court-martialed. “He’s our own supreme officer in this way,” said Lt. Ethan Mls, an officer at the Aberdeen Showing ground. "He should have the same standards as we need to."However, Defense Secretary William Cohen says that while everyone is disappointed by the Lewinsky matter, he doesn’t think Mr. Clinton’s sins are hurting the military services.“I have not detected any kind of reduction in the state of well-being of our military men and women,” he said. Atmosphere Force Lieutenant Kelly Flinn was forced to resign in order to avoid a court-martial for almost the same transgressions – committing adultery and also lying about it. When the Air Force’s top general justified the seemingly harsh treatment of this particular young woman, they did it in terms that could just as well apply right now to bill Clinton.“This is not a problem of adultery,” said Gen. Fogelman throughout reference to Flinn. "This is an issue about a officer who is vested to fly atomic weapons who disobeyed an order and lied. It is exactly what this is about."Reported simply by David Martin©98, CBS Worldwide Corporation., All Rights Earmarked  <a href="http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutlet.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutlet.html</a><br>
Some household bug murders have prompted a reminder and a ban due to a dangerous chemical aspect, reports CBS Information Health correspondent Dr. Emily Senay.The Environmental Defense Agency has prohibited the pesticide chlorpyrifos – and this is sometimes called Dursban – from use in common household products. You’ll find these brands on the labels of countless familiar brands of insecticides for the home and garden.Chlorpyrifos has been around for more than Three decades but the EPA affirms repeated exposure to this pesticide and others like it is a health hazard, specifically for children. The main problem is long-term exposure. We also are aware that even short-term exposure may cause problems. Symptoms connected with chlorpyrifos include nausea, dizziness and breathing difficulties. Individuals who have been exposed to large quantities of this have even perished.The EPA right now says we need to retain chlorpyrifos away from kids.Over 800 products located in the supermarket contain this specific chemical, including insect sprays for the home, flea collars for creatures, and products that destroy bugs in the lawn.“The latest studies have advised that neurological issues are the real risk the following,” says Medical professional. Senay.However, the products will not be recalled. “This is a period out,” explained Dr. Senay."You will still be capable to buy these products until 2001. These things are nevertheless going to be around. A lot of stores, however, might want to take them off the shelves now."The chemicals will still be used agriculturally. “Farmers will still use it on all sorts of items, crops<br>
but they’re going reduce its use in stuff that are most popular using kids, like grapes and apples,” explains Dr. Senay.Your EPA is going to try to get rid of chlorpyrifos from educational institutions, playgrounds and anyplace kids might be.Medical professional. Senay advises parents not to throw products using these chemicals down the drain or perhaps in the garbage. As an alternative, “Contact your state and local dangerous waste disposal system or local sound waste collection program for advice about how to handle them.”  <a href="http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutlet.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutlet.html</a></p>
