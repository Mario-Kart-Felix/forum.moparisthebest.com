    <title>Equip Ids Not Working?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/equip-ids-not-working/470458</link>
    <description>In RS2HD 562/659 when you look at the equip.txt file or something named similar to that, it contains a file that has the item id and the equip id for that item.  For some reason though, when you apply the ids to the itemDefinitions they don&#39;t all work.  One such as the Omni-Tiara (13655) The equip id is: [code]item = 13655	3123[/code]
But when you insert it in the itemdefinitions, and then refresh the server it doesn&#39;t work.  Other items tend to work, but a lot of other items just don&#39;t equip, does anyone know how to fix problems such as this?</description>
