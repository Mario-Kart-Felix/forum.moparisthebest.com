    <description>Ok so i&#39;ve downloaded a source called &#39;BrokenX v2&#39; I&#39;ve done a couple changed w/ the shop etc. and I wanted my friend to come try it out, this also happened with the source &#39;TeamTorva&#39;, but i assumed i have to change the ip&#39;s in gui.java and client.java in the client folder

Here&#39;s the pics of the gui.java ip&#39;s i&#39;ve edited

And here&#39;s the pics of the client.java

[URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/9/client1o.png/][IMG]http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/1422/client1o.png[/img][/URL]

[URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/847/client2.png/][IMG]http://img847.imageshack.us/img847/5990/client2.png[/img][/URL]

In the first picture on client.java i have it changed to 127.0.0.1 because if it&#39;s basedworld.no-ip.org i can&#39;t connect to my own server. After saving all these i then compiled.

I also changed the information in the source to, the cmd prompt even works too:

[URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/228/cmdpn.png/][IMG]http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/6571/cmdpn.png[/img][/URL]

All my ports are connected, i&#39;m like 95% positive i port forwarded correctly but is this all right?? did i miss something plz tell me, i need to know. I can upload more pics of different things if requested. 
I have my no-ip running fine too:
