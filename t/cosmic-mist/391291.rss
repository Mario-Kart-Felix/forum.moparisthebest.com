    <description>[b]Cosmic Mist[/b]

[b]Info:[/b]


Cosmic Mist is in development, this development is a MMORPG game. The creator is Joe Awwad; he is managing and running the development. This will be coded in C++ and Java. We are currently a big development and we are looking forward for the completion of the game. This will be free for all; there are no charges what so ever. We are looking very forward for the population of Cosmic Mist and would like to see how this roles.

Cosmic Mist will basically be a free and online game for everyone. We will have members and free users. As we know, we cannot host 100&#39;000&#39;s of people on the one dedicated server so we must have several dedicated servers with different worlds. The gaming will be HD and will be 3D to all members. Full screen mode might/will be for paid members. This is a huge project as you all see, we are trying our hardest to make this your game and have what you want in it! I bet you are looking forward to this!

This is not very easy to get staff on the forum&#39;s or the game. This is a hard earning matter, which you must work hard to earn it. All staff members will have their own little image in game and on the forums beside their name. This may make people think a bit, we will have two forums on the one website. Of course we will have our game forums with boards, but i had some suggestions that i should open a second forum. The second forum will be a general forum with all the basics on it. We will have My Award’s and Tabbed Menu on that forum. Having two forums’ sound&#39;s awesome but its hard work running a game and two forums all at once so i will need some awesome help from you guy&#39;s to manage my second forums.


This will be a broswer game, we will need a server/source and a gaming client.
