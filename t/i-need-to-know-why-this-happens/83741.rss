              <p>The items you are spawning are most likely NOT in your item.cfg therefore it’s loading an invalid item ID… Well, attempting to and when it can’t… It stops loading the account and gives you an error…</p>
<p>Just make sure the item you are adding is in your item.cfg and is compatible with your cache…</p>
<p>Goodluck…</p>
