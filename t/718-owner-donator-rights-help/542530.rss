    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-owner-donator-rights-help/542530</link>
    <description>so i&#39;ve got a matrix 718 server and i&#39;ve gotten myself owner status on it finally (new to all of this) and when try to spawn in items it&#39;ll work but when i go to equip them it&#39;ll say that i need to vote to be able to use it or tell me i need to be donator/extreme donator. i&#39;ve found the code where i need to change it to my name and put it in but even doing this and having owner rights isn&#39;t allowing me to use the items. any ideas on what i should do?</description>
