    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-new-bows-ranged-weps-and-staffs-staffs-and-2hs-into-2hs/343924</link>
    <description>I am wanting to add some new weapons. Bows and 2h&#39;s. How do i make the 2h&#39;s be 2h&#39;s and the bows be bow&#39;s and staves be staves? I searched my files but i couldnt find anything.
If any1 can help i would be greateful. BTW i am using a delta source.

IF YOU HAVE TO   YELL AT ME CAUSE ITS DELTA DON&#39;T POST!

And idk if this topic gets locked for this second question but... Does any1 no about a goood modeller program that is easy to use for new ppl at modelling?

If any mod tells me to remove the 2nd question i will do so.</description>

              <p>Yea, i did… The thing is, where do i declare bows as bows, 2h’s as 2h’s and staves (magic staves) as staves? I tried item, doesnt work. I tried weaponhandler, didnt work</p>
