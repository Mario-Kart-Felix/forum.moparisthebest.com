    <title>Dragon claws need help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dragon-claws-need-help/364859</link>
    <description>I need help with dragon claws the dragon claws work on npc but not plays on players it only hits twice on spec. Then to see the spec bar i have to put a melle wep with spec on then put d claws and the spec shows. Then after i spec it still shows that the spec is ready to spec but it doesnt and it doesnt show the spec drained it stays 100% but it says im out of spec.

list of whats wrong

claws spec on npc but not players
gfx and animation weird(my person looks like a blob that flings every where)
no spec bar unless you wear a melle wep with spec
spec doesnt show that it drains after spec
spec bar stays highlighted
