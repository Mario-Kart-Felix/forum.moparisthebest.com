    <description>I have the following version of JDK:
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23

I changed the ip in client.java to 0.0.0.0 in order to be able to local host, however it seems that it doesn&#39;t like my java even though I&#39;ve changed it in the launcher, and all necessary files.

If anyone knows of a specific tut to describe how to do this or could give me a little insight to a guide it&#39;d be much appreciated :)</description>
