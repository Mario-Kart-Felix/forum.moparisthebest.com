    <description>[center][size=24pt]ADRIAN CHRIS[/size]

Recently I decided to start my own project on making a new Rsps. The only problem that prevents me from doing this: I am very new to coding.
 I think it&#39;s fun getting known with coding, but I still have a long way to go, though I seem to learn pretty fast from what I have taken a look at so far. 
As I am writing this, I am completely aware of that it might seem stupid to the more experienced coders who take a look at this thread in the future, that I started this project with my lack of knowledge. 
The thing is: it is not stupid at all. I have played Runescape Private Servers for years, and RuneScape before that. I also have a very good experience with communities, and I know very well of the 
difference between what&#39;s right and wrong. Life is [u]unfair[/u], but I believe in the best of it. 
For as long as I have played RSPS&#39;s, I always meant that I&#39;d fit in as an owner, or atleast part of the Staff. I never applied for Staff in any Rsps&#39;s though, even if I had the possibilites. 
The more experienced you are as an coder, the better. When it comes to Staffpositions, I can only say that I am looking for experienced people who are able to put some effort to the server.
This means you will have to put some effort and give me a good impression of what you are capable of. If I am hosting a server, I am NOT adding random people to Staff. You have to deserve it. 
Be aware of this before you decide to be a part of this server, which WILL be on the toplists in the future. You have my word on it, all we need is patience.
That is why we do this for fun.

[size=12pt]The Server: [/size]
Well, what can I say? I have no idea of what the name should be. I have thought of many ideas, but they are all trash. I want something creative and original, and rather not 
something with &quot;SCAPE&quot; in it as of that it&#39;s sexually abused by all kind of RSPS&#39;s. 
I don&#39;t mind any 600 Servers with HD graphics, but I rather have the old school 317 Grahpics with the following features.

[size=12pt]Features:[/size]
Gear:
All spirit shields 100%
Dragon claws 100%
Staff of Light 100%
Korasi 100%
All Chaotics 100%
All Godswords 100%
All PvP Armour 100%
Torva, Pernix, Virtus 100%

Ancient curses!
No dupes!
Stable economy!
Proper item switching!
Edgeville as Home
(Donators features- to be discussed, not sure)
Automatic donation!
(Working Duel Arena?)
All skills 100% (Summoning, hunter, dungeoneering, construction- not needed)
PvP zones- PvP drops (Statius, Vestas... Corrupt, non- corrupt)
Ancient magics
Lunar magics
Teleporters 

Warriors Guild
Barrows
JAD 100%
Corp 100%
Nex 100%
Tormented Demons 100%
KBD 100%
Steel Dragons, Iron dragons
Mithril Dragons 100% (placed in deep wildy, a bit overpowered, drops Korasi and Staff of light?)
Full GWD (With killcount, not being able to noclip into chambers)
And more...!

I will be the Owner. The most experienced coder will be an Owner next to me. I am not sure how I will choose my Staff list and it&#39;s positions yet (that&#39;s not the point of making the server and shouldn&#39;t matter too much), 
but I am looking for three experienced coders!
 Donations will be sent to the Server&#39;s Paypal address. I will have access to the PayPal address at first. (Money will be spent on vBulletin, Dedicated Servers, Advertising, more..)
You have to be motivated for this if you want to join. With the features I have listed above, we can make it far. There will be a lot of work, and it&#39;s going to take AWHILE.
We&#39;ll never give up. Life will be a first priority, but when we are able to we will try to make progress.

The more experienced you are as an coder, the better. When it comes to Staffpositions, I can only say that I am looking for experienced people who are able to put some effort to the server.<br>
