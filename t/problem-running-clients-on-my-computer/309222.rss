              <p>Your most likely on Windows Vista 64bit. Idk why this happens it happens on some and some they work. This is also just 317s. Idk a fix for it I was looking for one a week ago or so. Also some clients have a “Run 84” and that works on vista 64bit so maybe you could ask around about that.</p>
