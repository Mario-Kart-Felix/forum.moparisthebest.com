    <title>Are RSPS Illegal?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/are-rsps-illegal/420730</link>
    <description>I know I&#39;m a really old member of Moparscape, and I left a long time ago, but I wanna come back because Runescape has became worse than bull crap.

I think I&#39;m much more mature now, and I think I will be able to get along with the Moparscape community better than last time.

I haven&#39;t studied Java yet and I probably forgot almost the few bits I scarcely knew, so I decided to come back and maybe read some online lessons.

My question here is if RSPSs are illegal. I have heard people saying they are and they aren&#39;t. But now I wanna know for sure, because I really want to make a new one. :)</description>

              <p>They are not illegal, however the clients are. However, JaGex cannot do anything about normal clients, only webclients. They are illegal because use their items, their interfaces, their whole cache. However now a days, JaGex won’t really shut down 317 servers, only the higher revisions. So in a technical sense, RSPS servers are not illegal, the clients are.</p>

              <p>Technically they are, but Jagex, won’t spend their time hunting down small RSPS’s like most of the ones out there are. Just the ones getting a lot of players. Most of those, have lawyers that can get them out of those situations.</p>
