    <description>(to the idiots who say an admin didnt tell me to come here, nial did, he said for me to ask you guys.)






I have been having a problem with the server status page not letting me add servers...

It tells me &quot;you only get to post one server, sorry&quot;

I haven&#39;t even added servers is why I&#39;m so confused.



Please tell me why it does this to me, and a few other people







the administrators of Mopar-Scape sent me here so don&#39;t argue over me posting this issue here please.


O and if it is bugged, fix it!</description>
