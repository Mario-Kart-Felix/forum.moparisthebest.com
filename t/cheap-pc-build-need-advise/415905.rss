    <title>Cheap pc build, need advise</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cheap-pc-build-need-advise/415905</link>
    <description>basically I&#39;m building a pc for someone and I need some advice on the build I&#39;ve got, keep in mind it will almost exclusively be used for facebook/web browsing, also I&#39;m not paying for it so the cheapest possible build to maximum performance would be nice

I swapped a regular harddrive for a ssd since their current pc only uses 15gb~ give or take so a 40gb ssd will give a huge performance increase and extra storage won&#39;t be needed, the 4gb ram is for futureproofing and I also included a graphics card since igp performance is terrible even on high end mobos

              <p>cheaper cpu and gpu.  not all that needed for just mainly web stuff.  i managed just fine with an ati 2600 for about 6 years, playing games like crysis on low-mid settings fine.</p>
