        <p>Ok well GTA:IV came and i booted up the PS3 and played it and first impressions: what a game! It obviously has some flaws but thats ok because you can get around those. Firstly lets start with the single player.<br>
[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-u">Single Player</span>[/size]<br>
[size=11pt]<span class="bbcode-u">General</span>[/size]<br>
Well the thing that really pisses me off is the controls, they have changed from classic GTA to bloody annoying. But you can choose to have classic controls but these prove to be fiddly and hard to use in the new game so i don’t advise it. The genral gameplay is pretty much classic GTA roaming around beating up hobos and picking up hookers on faggios so don’t expect anything different. Some great new features include being able to pick up objects to lob at unsuspecting fat people and windows. This isn’t as entirely great as it sounds as it doesn’t always work some objects that should be able to be picked up can’t and throwing is almost an impossible task for dead accuracy.<br>
[size=11pt]<span class="bbcode-u">Missions</span>[/size]<br>
Ok so in previous incarnations of the game you got a big glowing red circle to stand in for a mission, not anymore. It is just a little arrow point down to where you must go this isn’t as showy as before it looks more discreet and keeps realism in the game. Missions in general are typical GTA, go kill some druggies and get my money kill this guy etc etc. Some missions you will receive over your mobile phone that need to be done instantly otherwise it has an affect on the story. By this i mean that if someone, lets says your cousin, calls you and says ‘i need help please come pick me up’ and you decide to do a different mission in place of this one then you get an angry call after completeting the other mission where you find out your cousin has just had his ass spanked by several russian guys and is now at the hospital. Obviously this means you don’t have to do the other mission and instead you get a replacement mission which undoubtedly leads to the same ending anyway. Not all missions are work in the world of GTA:IV some are fun, there is a particularly good mission near the begining where you and your cousin must go and see a show that is on down the road. Obviously you can just press X or whatever you press on 360 and skip this but that is never as much fun. Other more casual missions include taking your girlfriend out on a date to go and play a few frames of bowling. This is a hard minigame and definately tryed my patience.<br>
Edit: The missions after time start to get samey and reptitive, you often find yourself doing the exact same mission over and over again. Also as you get deeper into the game you start to complete missions just to get them out of the way and not because you want to do them it saps the fun from the game but its not all negative as some missions are exciting and are a laugh but the average run of the mill mission is exactly the same as the last few missions so you soon tire of this and find yourself just roaming the streets blowing stuff up for the hell of it.<br>
[size=11pt]<span class="bbcode-u">Driving</span>[/size]<br>
This is where some of the flaws with GTA:IV come in, my main concern is that when you brake using L2 you cant turn at the same time so you are set going straight. Obviously the handbrake is more use and when you whack a car around a corner at 100mph its alot more fun as you slide around the corner like you should do. Controlling the handbrake turn is incredibly hard in some cars but once you have a knack for it there will be no problems. Just sling the car round and then push in the oppisite direction to counteract the force and you are away. Handling is extremely skewif, in GTA:SA most cars you could sling around like quadbikes and it would be awesome fun. But now you turn too hard the car just spins turn to little nothing happens turn just right you go wide so my advice is stick with the handrake or a sports car. Strictly speaking this next bit shouldnt be under this category but i couldn’t be bothered to make another one, planes are not included in this GTA as most of you will know just to ease anyone’s mind it is not because Rockstar are afraid people will fly them in to buildings its because they just aren’t practical in such a small area which i must say i disagree with. Now for the PS3 owners that have this, i must mention sixaxis. Sixaxis is incredibly fiddly for driving and flying, in a boat its not too bad and on a bike its  acceptable but i must warn anyone trying to do it in a heli that they will crash extremely soon and in a big ball of fire. Speaking of fire something else that concerns me (and i know i sound like a grumpy old man but hell i survive) is the fact that cars are almost impossible to blow up and extremely easy to roll. Those GTA veterans that are reading this will know that the law in GTA is if you roll your car it blows up. Not anymore it is exremely hard now, you can’t even keep crashing into stuff to blow up your car, it just loses power and your engine cuts out. how gay is that?<br>
[size=11pt]<span class="bbcode-u">Storyline</span>[/size]<br>
Its great, more in depth than ever before and it has a purpose for you blowing stuff up and executing people( which you can do in a fantastic menagery of blood thirsty ways) i won’t ruin for those that havnt got the game but the basics is he has come from somewhere in europe( either romain or poland or somewhere like that maybe even russia i cant remember) and he has come searching for the american dream or so he says. After a few missions you find out more as to why he is truly here and it isn’t long before you get your first girlfriend either so the story develops and you can shape to how you want aswell.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">[size=12pt]Multiplayer[/size]</span><br>
[size=11pt]<span class="bbcode-u">General</span>[/size]<br>
Generally it rocks, no more info needed <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> but of course i will give it to you. It is the first GTA game ever to have online multiplayer GTA:SA had offline multiplayer which frankly sucked, you could only get in one vehicel between the two of you, there could only be two of you and the camera was crappy. So now with PSN and XboxLive GTA:IV has a great online potential. There are several game types from the usual deathmatch to the not so usual cops and robbers. There is of course free roam online where you and a few mates can do whatever the hell you want around the city for however long you want. Gameplay is pretty much identical to offline so no need to worry that you won’t enjoy it because some aspects are tweaked etc. No its perfect, you can get up to 7 people in a party and all climb onto a bus and have a 7 man drive by. Alternatively you can hop on to faggios with your mates and play jousting for a laugh. If you go for the serious games they all revolve around cash and not score. Its not like COD4:MW where you need x amount of kills to win its all about cash which you can win and lose over the course of a game by dieing, killing, jacking rides, and finding it. Its all about money and thats what counts.<br>
Hope you enjoy my review, as i get further into the game i will edit this more and more</p>

        <p>Nice review, unfortunately i’m refraining from reading as I don’t want all of the surprises revealed. I was quite lookin forward to gta: san andreas and when I got it I was 10 times more impressed with the amounts of features. So i’d rather not read much about gta iv to leave the surprises to myself.</p>

        <p>[quote=“ThugLife, post:1, topic:202726”]I’m currently on 38% done and unlocked all three islands, and i must say that the story line, the characters and the detail of the game just makes me want to do mission after mission. I probably would of been further than where i am now if i hadn’t been ill for the last few days, its such an addictive game that i have hardly tried the online play yet since i’ll probably get addicted to that and not finish the story line.</p>
<p>Great game, 9.8/10 (the .2 is the little features we had on san andreas that have been missed out on this one, no i don’t mean the character customization either :P)[/quote]you can but clothes at stores… what i miss is being able to take cars to shops and pimp them out</p>

        <p>To be perfectly honest, I hated the game when I got it but now I’ve gotten more into it I like it. I’m on the third island and currently doing missions for the two McGreary brothers ( Gerry and Derrick ). I must say that once you complete a few missions you keep getting dragged into doing more and more missions, the story line isn’t dead like the last few games in the GTA series, it’s something I can personally get into.</p>
<p>The only real thing I do hate about this game is the fact you cannot have <span class="bbcode-b">MAJOR</span> character / vehicle customizations, I cannot get haircuts, I cannot customize my rides, I don’t have a garage in ANY of my safehouses, meaning I cannot store a vehicle.</p>
<p>I’d rate this game around a 9, just on the grounds it’s broken the mould of GTA Games and the advancement of the graphics, physics and online gameplay is immense.</p>

        <p>Cowie think of it like this, GTA 3 was a whole new GTA they had to build that from nothing then build extra bits on and release them as other games such as Vice city and San andreas. They completely rebuilt this one too, this is a new start for another series. Just wait for the ‘expansion packs’ as rockstar calls them on this one for those extra features you miss on san andreas. And yes, if you park the car properly in the parking space it WILL save there, all my cars have and there is no reason yours shouldn’t.</p>
<p>This is a fucking amazing framework for later GTA’s in the ‘GTA IV’ series. I’m willing to call this probably the best game i have ever played.</p>

<p>If you park it correctly, it does save it there, for a while.</p>
<p>I miss the fact that I cannot actually just get a property with a fucking garage, nor can I actually choose the property I want. I’m stuck in Playboy X’s old penthouse, or the one Roman got me in the second island.<br>

<p>I will back you up on the fact that this is probably the best game I have ever played, also if this is just a framework for the future " expansion packs " that are coming out, then I seriously cannot wait, because I know for a fact it will be awesome.</p>

        <p>I personally like the parking spaces, Holding triangle to turn off engine and get out of car and leaving it parked :D. Its a nice change that imo the game needed, i probably would not of found the game at all enjoyable if it had the same concepts as GTA 3 - SA.</p>

        <p>The frame rate, the graphics (Only slightly better on the color side) and the loading times are better on the ps3 and rockstar have already said when they announced the 360 content that ps3 will get their own dlc later on in the year.

        <p>Well i have now got further into the game and i must say the cracks are showing what i once thought to be a pioneering game is crumbling. Its still an OK game but wouldn’t give it more than that there are flaws and appealing features come up as gimics later on still suggest buying it for people who are new to the GTA series(and these are few and far between) but for veterans and long time fans who havnt already bought it save your money</p>

        <p>Yeah sanga282, what are the ‘flaws’, i’m still sticking to my ‘This is the best GTA in the series and probably the best game i’ve played’. Think of it like this, this is the GTA 3 for next-gen: There are expansion packs to come (eg. Vice city, and san andreas), look at this as framework for later games in the ‘GTA IV series’.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=GTA+IV+reviews&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=GTA+IV+reviews&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a</a><br>
For ‘Trusted’ reviews.</p>
