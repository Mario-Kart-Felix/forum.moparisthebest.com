    <title>Ice barrage</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ice-barrage/156845</link>
    <description>Well, on some servers, when your at a really far distance, you can barrage someone no problem. On mine, when i go to that same distance, and barrage my enemy, my player runs towards them, as if they were attacking normal...

The distance, is maximum 8 squares apart to barrage.

If you are more than 8 squares, it runs to the enemy. How can i change this? that you can barrage from any distance?</description>
