    <title>A small problem with Shops? (317)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-small-problem-with-shops-317/535773</link>
    <description>[size=12pt][font=arial][b]Hello all the wonderful people of the Moparscape Community.[/b]

I am having a small problem with my shops. I have created a shop that will exchange a &#39;Agility Arena Ticket&#39; (Item ID: 2996) for 1000M and will sell for it back to you for 1000M.

But the problem is that if you have 3 tickets you can sell 1 and then get 1B, then sell another and get 2B but if you sell 3 it only goes to 2147M and I know that&#39;s Java&#39;s limit but I was wondering if a message could display in the message box that would read &quot;You don&#39;t have enough space&#39; or something like that. Even if you sell 10 AGT you will still only get 2147M maximum.

Is there a way to fix this problem so that players do not lose their huge amounts of cash?

Sorry if this is difficult to understand. I am happy to provide any relevant information and I will Rep++ to the person that can help me solve this :)

Notes: I have PKPlanet Source V3 which is a 317 Server[/font][/size]</description>

<p>Sorry thanks for your help I appreciate it. But I do not have a ‘Sellitem.cfg’ or anything in my source files and I cannot find where I would add it in ‘Client.java’. I am stumped.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:">  :([/quote]<br>
It’d go in your shophandlers sellitem method (Where your shophandler is I don’t know)</p>

<p>Thank you for this, but I seem to be having trouble doing this. Would you be able to explain it in more detail or link me to something than can help? Sorry haha.</p>
