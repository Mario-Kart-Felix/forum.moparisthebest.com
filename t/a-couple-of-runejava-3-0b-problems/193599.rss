    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-couple-of-runejava-3-0b-problems/193599</link>
    <description>Well, i am useing the newest runejava, 3.0b.
Now, when i range, its perfect [b]except[/b] It is always either 1 or 0, no matter what level you are, or bow and arrows you are using. How can i fix?

#2. 
When it attacks, its very slow. You will hit once(the animation will display) And youll attack more but no animation will be displayed, and then in 10secs, it displays once more. How can i fix that?
Any help is very much appreitaited
