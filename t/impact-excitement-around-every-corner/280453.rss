[COLOR=Red]Requests added at the bottom.[/COLOR]


[B][U][FONT=Impact][SIZE=5][COLOR=Red]Impact:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][/U][/B]
Impact is a server that was founded by Core. Right now I am just about done with beta stages and planning having beta about 1-2 times a week to check progress on what we have added. If not during the week then for sure on the weekend. This will be a player killing based server, but it will have so much more then just that, we have decided to actually add several more skills since people say that pking all the time is a bit boring so we gave it a little more. There will be a majority of custom to RuneScape made mini games, some use runescape ideas but they are mostly custom. There is excitement around every corner!

[B][I][U][SIZE=5]Release Date: [COLOR=Red]Unknown[/COLOR][/SIZE][/U][/I][/B]

[b][u]Server Base:[/u][/b] [i]Emulous 1.6.2[/i]

[B][U][FONT=Impact][SIZE=5][COLOR=Red]Forums:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][/U][/B]
I have already purchased a domain and I&#39;m still looking for forum shit. If you want the link just ask. We have improved them alot by working on several pages.

[B][U][FONT=Impact][SIZE=5][COLOR=Red]Client:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][/U][/B] 
The client is currently under development by Stewie_. It is a 474 game frame with so much more. There will be only a few updated items. E.G. Dragon boots, Helm of neitiznot, Skillcapes, and more. But to many to mention, just think of items you would PK in and those would be them. There will be client side features that are edited due to it being a 377 based server, we decided to add a few 474 interfaces as they look better.

[B][U][FONT=Impact][SIZE=5][COLOR=Red]The Server:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][/U][/B]
In Impact, there will be skills for others to train, but the skills will be majorty for Player Killing. Not all of them are though, we are adding a few extra to supply the PK supplies. Maybe in the future more will be added for the sake of players enjoyment.

[COLOR=Red][b][i]Current Skills:[/i][/b][/COLOR]

[ul][*]Fishing
[*]Cooking
[*]Herblore
[*]Thieving
[*]Runecrafting
[*]Crafting
[*]Woodcutting
[*]Slayer
[*]Fletching
[*]Agility
[*]Mining
[*]Smithing[/ul]

[center]
As you can see each of these skills are vital to player killing. The server will have an economy also no commands to pickup or get 99 in a skill. You must work for you levels/items. There is only 1 teleport in the game and that is to Entrana. Entrana is the island I choose for the home because it has all you will ever need on it. To get around you will use Amulets and Rings. E.G. Duel ring, Amulet of Glory, and Games Necklace. Amulet of Glory will take you to 3 places.
[/center]
[COLOR=Red][b][i]Teleport List:[/i][/b][/COLOR]
[b][i]Amulet of Glory:[/i][/b]

[ul][*]Varrock
[*]Edgeville
[*]Magebank[/ul]

[COLOR=Red][b]Varrock;[/b][/COLOR]
Varrock wild is a multi pking area, but wild levels are in effect so you must be with 1 or 2 levels of each other :p

[COLOR=Red][b]Edgeville;[/b][/COLOR]
Wild in Edgeville is basically 1 on 1 with someone that is your level if your not feeling the risk.

[COLOR=Red][b]Mage Bank;[/b][/COLOR]
Here in Mage Bank you risk your items, but the reward can be even greater. In mage bank you are able to fight anyone 50 levels below or above you.

[b][i]Duel Ring:[/i][/b]

[ul][*]Relleka
[*]Crash Island
[*]Karamja Volcano
[*]Brimhaven Dungeon[/ul]

[center]
[COLOR=Red][b]Relleka;[/b][/COLOR]
There you can battle the interesting creatures of Rock crabs or you can walk south in to the city of Relleka where there are some shops and Guards to steal from.

[COLOR=Red][b]Crash Island;[/b][/COLOR]
There is a wide variety at Crash Island. You can kill Moss Giants for different type so armor, herbs, weapons, etc. Or you can have a dangerous fight with the Elf Warriors, they shoot there crystal arrows at you so watch out for them. In the back you will find a pit leading to a mini quest with the Giant Mole.

[COLOR=Red][b]Karamja Volcano;[/b][/COLOR]
In the hot volcano of Karamja you will find different types of NPCs that use magic and melee. You might even stumble across the lost city of TzHaar.

[COLOR=Red][b]Brimhaven Dungeon;[/b][/COLOR]
The dungeon of Brimhaven is known to many strong creatures including Dragons, Hellhounds, and other huge monsters. I wouldn&#39;t suggest going there unless it is a must and if you do go there an Anti Dragon Shield is a must.

On Impact there will be a lot of mini games. At the moment there happens to be only 2, but later on there will be a lot more.
[/center]
[COLOR=Red][b][i]Current Mini Games:[/i][/b][/COLOR]

[ul][*]Fight Arena
[*]Barrows
[*]Duel Arena[/ul]

[center]
[COLOR=Red][b]Fight Arena;[/b][/COLOR]
Fight Arena is a custom mini game, it is basically an all out free for all. It is based at the Fight arena, you start out in the lobby and there are 3 different rooms next to each other and it will count down. Once the player count gets up to 4 a time of 60 seconds will start counting down and once it reaches 0 the game will begin. There are no rules, you can team, you can use melee, you can use range, you can use mage, you can eat, it doesn&#39;t matter whatever you want. The last one standing or the winner will be given a choice.
[/center]
[COLOR=Red][b][i]Reward Choice:[/i][/b][/COLOR]

[ul][*]50,000 coins
[*]Mystery Box[/ul]

[center]
[b]Mystery Box;[/b] The mystery box is home to many different items both good and bad. You will just have to see for yourself.

[COLOR=Red][b][i]Barrows;[/i][/b][/COLOR]
Barrows is actually a huge part of the server, seeing as that is how you will be getting your barrows armor :). You can go to Barrows via your Games Necklace, make sure to bring your spade. You can pick any tomb you would like and dig on top you will find yourself in a crypt of some brother, you will have to open the tomb and a brother will pop up and come at you if you survive a point will be added to your kill count. You can find out your kill count by the lower right hand corner of your screen. Once you defeat 5 of the brothers you will find a secret entrance and it will lead to the chest once at the chest the last brother will appear and if you kill him you will be able to loot the chest. The chest is full of a lot of items.
[/center]
[COLOR=Red][b][i]Possible Rewards:[/i][/b][/COLOR]

[ul][*]All barrows items
[*]All combat runes
[*]Coins[/ul]

[center]

[COLOR=Red][b][i]Duel Arena;[/i][/b][/COLOR]
Duel arena in Impact will be a fun and enjoyable mini game. You can stake as much or as little as you want. You can duel who ever you want. I would say that Dueling in Impact is 95% exact to RuneScape (5% to unfound bugs).

[COLOR=Red][b][i]Player Killing:[/i][/b][/COLOR]
PVP is the main part of the server because it is player killing based. The combat is near perfect, most specials working to perfection. Every single prayer works exact to RuneScape. There is an items on death button to check what you will keep if skulled. You lose all your items if you are skulled. There are both single and mutli zones in the wild.

[b][i]Features: [/i][/b]
There are some pretty nice features in the server. There is Clan Chat, currently it is disabled because there is a bug that disables all of the other commands. There is full Glory and Crystal Bow charging. A lot more stuff I just can&#39;t think of anything at the moment.

Impact is a server that was founded by Core. Right now I am just about done with beta stages and planning having beta about 1-2 times a week to check progress on what we have added. If not during the week then for sure on the weekend. This will be a player killing based server, but it will have so much more then just that, we have decided to actually add several more skills since people say that pking all the time is a bit boring so we gave it a little more. There will be a majority of custom to RuneScape made mini games, some use runescape ideas but they are mostly custom. There is excitement around every corner!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">[SIZE=5]Release Date: [COLOR=Red]Unknown[/COLOR][/SIZE]</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Server Base:</span></span> <span class="bbcode-i">Emulous 1.6.2</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">[FONT=Impact][SIZE=5][COLOR=Red]Forums:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]</span></span><br>
I have already purchased a domain and I’m still looking for forum shit. If you want the link just ask. We have improved them alot by working on several pages.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">[FONT=Impact][SIZE=5][COLOR=Red]Client:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]</span></span><br>
The client is currently under development by Stewie_. It is a 474 game frame with so much more. There will be only a few updated items. E.G. Dragon boots, Helm of neitiznot, Skillcapes, and more. But to many to mention, just think of items you would PK in and those would be them. There will be client side features that are edited due to it being a 377 based server, we decided to add a few 474 interfaces as they look better.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">[FONT=Impact][SIZE=5][COLOR=Red]The Server:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]</span></span><br>
In Impact, there will be skills for others to train, but the skills will be majorty for Player Killing. Not all of them are though, we are adding a few extra to supply the PK supplies. Maybe in the future more will be added for the sake of players enjoyment.<br>

[<em>]Fletching<br>
[</em>]Agility<br>
[<em>]Mining<br>
[</em>]Smithing[/ul]</p>
<p>[center]<br>
As you can see each of these skills are vital to player killing. The server will have an economy also no commands to pickup or get 99 in a skill. You must work for you levels/items. There is only 1 teleport in the game and that is to Entrana. Entrana is the island I choose for the home because it has all you will ever need on it. To get around you will use Amulets and Rings. E.G. Duel ring, Amulet of Glory, and Games Necklace. Amulet of Glory will take you to 3 places.<br>

Varrock wild is a multi pking area, but wild levels are in effect so you must be with 1 or 2 levels of each other <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>[COLOR=Red]<span class="bbcode-b">Edgeville;</span>[/COLOR]<br>
Wild in Edgeville is basically 1 on 1 with someone that is your level if your not feeling the risk.</p>
<p>[COLOR=Red]<span class="bbcode-b">Mage Bank;</span>[/COLOR]<br>
Here in Mage Bank you risk your items, but the reward can be even greater. In mage bank you are able to fight anyone 50 levels below or above you.</p>

<p>[center]<br>
[COLOR=Red]<span class="bbcode-b">Relleka;</span>[/COLOR]<br>
There you can battle the interesting creatures of Rock crabs or you can walk south in to the city of Relleka where there are some shops and Guards to steal from.</p>
<p>[COLOR=Red]<span class="bbcode-b">Crash Island;</span>[/COLOR]<br>
There is a wide variety at Crash Island. You can kill Moss Giants for different type so armor, herbs, weapons, etc. Or you can have a dangerous fight with the Elf Warriors, they shoot there crystal arrows at you so watch out for them. In the back you will find a pit leading to a mini quest with the Giant Mole.</p>
<p>[COLOR=Red]<span class="bbcode-b">Karamja Volcano;</span>[/COLOR]<br>
In the hot volcano of Karamja you will find different types of NPCs that use magic and melee. You might even stumble across the lost city of TzHaar.</p>
<p>[COLOR=Red]<span class="bbcode-b">Brimhaven Dungeon;</span>[/COLOR]<br>
The dungeon of Brimhaven is known to many strong creatures including Dragons, Hellhounds, and other huge monsters. I wouldn’t suggest going there unless it is a must and if you do go there an Anti Dragon Shield is a must.</p>
<p>On Impact there will be a lot of mini games. At the moment there happens to be only 2, but later on there will be a lot more.<br>

[</em>]Barrows<br>
[*]Duel Arena[/ul]</p>
<p>[center]<br>
[COLOR=Red]<span class="bbcode-b">Fight Arena;</span>[/COLOR]<br>
Fight Arena is a custom mini game, it is basically an all out free for all. It is based at the Fight arena, you start out in the lobby and there are 3 different rooms next to each other and it will count down. Once the player count gets up to 4 a time of 60 seconds will start counting down and once it reaches 0 the game will begin. There are no rules, you can team, you can use melee, you can use range, you can use mage, you can eat, it doesn’t matter whatever you want. The last one standing or the winner will be given a choice.<br>

<p>[ul][<em>]50,000 coins<br>
[</em>]Mystery Box[/ul]</p>
<p>[center]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Mystery Box;</span> The mystery box is home to many different items both good and bad. You will just have to see for yourself.</p>
<p>[COLOR=Red]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Barrows;</span></span>[/COLOR]<br>
Barrows is actually a huge part of the server, seeing as that is how you will be getting your barrows armor :). You can go to Barrows via your Games Necklace, make sure to bring your spade. You can pick any tomb you would like and dig on top you will find yourself in a crypt of some brother, you will have to open the tomb and a brother will pop up and come at you if you survive a point will be added to your kill count. You can find out your kill count by the lower right hand corner of your screen. Once you defeat 5 of the brothers you will find a secret entrance and it will lead to the chest once at the chest the last brother will appear and if you kill him you will be able to loot the chest. The chest is full of a lot of items.<br>

<p>[ul][<em>]All barrows items<br>
[</em>]All combat runes<br>
[*]Coins[/ul]</p>
<p>[center]</p>
<p>[COLOR=Red]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Duel Arena;</span></span>[/COLOR]<br>
Duel arena in Impact will be a fun and enjoyable mini game. You can stake as much or as little as you want. You can duel who ever you want. I would say that Dueling in Impact is 95% exact to RuneScape (5% to unfound bugs).</p>
<p>[COLOR=Red]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Player Killing:</span></span>[/COLOR]<br>
PVP is the main part of the server because it is player killing based. The combat is near perfect, most specials working to perfection. Every single prayer works exact to RuneScape. There is an items on death button to check what you will keep if skulled. You lose all your items if you are skulled. There are both single and mutli zones in the wild.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Features: </span></span><br>
There are some pretty nice features in the server. There is Clan Chat, currently it is disabled because there is a bug that disables all of the other commands. There is full Glory and Crystal Bow charging. A lot more stuff I just can’t think of anything at the moment.</p>
