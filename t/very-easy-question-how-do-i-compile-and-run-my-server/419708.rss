    <title>Very Easy Question - How do i compile and run my server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/very-easy-question-how-do-i-compile-and-run-my-server/419708</link>
    <description>Alright, so i have a server, and after i edit the files and everything, i don&#39;t understand what to press. Their is like 3 compile buttons, and 3 run buttons, no matter which one i press, it doesn&#39;t work and the server just goes down. I have to end up using memleak. So my question, how do i compile and run a server after i edit it?

Thanks.

              <p>it doesn´t. first check your compile servers (right click - edit) to see if they are to your version of jdk (so if it says c:\programfiles\java\jdk1.6.0_25[morestuffhere] and you have jdk 1.7.0 change it to c:\programfiles\java\jdk1.7.0) that should make your compiler work. if nothing works well get someone to fix em cuz the first one that made em probs did it wrong.</p>
