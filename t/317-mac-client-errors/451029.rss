    <title>[317] Mac Client Errors</title>

    <description>Source: Delta

Hey guys, I&#39;m just have a slight problem with my webclient/downloadable client. It isn&#39;t working for macs, it downloads the cache and everything correctly, but it gets stuck at &quot;Unpacking files&quot;. Basically, it can&#39;t find the directory. What would you use for macs? If anyone knows how to fix this, and can supply their code it would be much appreciated. Even if you think you know how, any suggestions are appreciated. 

Thanks a lot. :)</description>
