    <description>Hello, i&#39;&#39;ve been trying to fix the code so that u cannot attk the other player who is not in multi.

Because say if somone in 1 vs 1 zone is fiting.. nd somone goes to multi they can attk them..

Ive tried making a code if other player getting attked isnot in multi then sM this person is in combat. 

I dont no how to do it ..
 Can some one just give me a little hint of wat it should look like i can do the rest my self..

Thanks</description>
