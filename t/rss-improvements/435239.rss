    <title>RSS Improvements</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rss-improvements/435239</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve started using Google Reader again, and one of the feeds I have on my list is this forum&#39;s.

I think it would be nice to have some customization options for RSS.  On the technical end of things, settings could be retrieved through appending a unique key to the RSS url, for example:
[code]https://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?type=rss;action=.xml;key=d3b07384d113edec49eaa6238ad5ff00[/code]

The most important thing I would want from this is the ability to have hidden forums that I can see from my account on my feed, so I don&#39;t have to log in to check them.  Being able to remove certain categories/forums from the feed would be nice as well.</description>

[/quote]I had to wget the xml file with my cookie and then read the wgetted xml file to get everything to work when we used to have rss in <span class="hashtag">#mitbrss</span> <span class="hashtag">#gamedev</span> and <span class="hashtag">#mscaperss</span> :F</p>

<p>That’s easily done, but the point is to be able to personalize it like that without workarounds (like using wget with a cookie, Google Reader can’t quite do that).[/quote]My point was that I support the key suggestion because of the way that MITB has done his TOS.</p>
