    <title>Hmm, Jagex getting desperate?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hmm-jagex-getting-desperate/139138</link>
    <description>Well it seems that in their eternal quest for money, they have glorified the Membership section of the web page, putting it in gold trim and right below the language selection:

I think they&#39;re losing customers because they just don&#39;t listen. Look at their forums, lol. Half the rants are basically retarded. Here&#39;s some sample ones:

stop following me!
NER* THE WHIP!!!!!!!!!
wtf??
DATING ON RUNESCAPE?! ROFL!
GUYS ROBE LEGS!! GAHHHHHH!!!!!

In this particular board, half of them can&#39;t type, 25% of them type in all caps, and the rest can&#39;t do anything but complain.

Personally, I think that the reason they moved the &quot;membership benifits&quot; section to the top is so that idiots who don&#39;t know how to scroll down (much like the people who post MSCP stuff in the General Discussion board) will be able to convince their (insert older person with credit card here) to buy them membership.

Not that you all care, but I&#39;m bored and happened to notice this.</description>

They are business people, they run a business, one of the main reasons is to earn enough money to pay for expenses, and another being EARN MORE MONEY.</p>
<p>No such thing as a greedy person when you are running a business.</p>

              <p>This is how i think of things.</p>
<p>A business’ money belongs to the business. Not the owners, creators, partners or whatever you want to call them. When you start a business you decide weather your going to a, milk the business for all you can get out of it (at one point it will most likely go bankrupt but thats not your problem as you wont have to pay (as long as your ltd)) or b, you could create a company and add your self in the payroll. You would probably decide to pay yourself more than your employee’s however if you pay yourself too much you could go bankrupt.</p>
<p>Its very difficult starting a business from scratch but JAGEX must have worked very hard to get there 10m+ members… its sort of harsh that we sat back wile JAGEX were busy spending time and money to make it work and then we come along and ‘h4x0r th3 sh1t 0ut3r 1t’ <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>I don’t know the English terms for it, but there are roughly 4 kinds of companies. At least in my country there are. Ill explain them a bit.</p>
<ol>
<li>Nameless company - Notated on the stock market.</li>
<li>Closed partnership - works quite like <span class="hashtag">#1</span>. You and a few others throw a pile of money together and start a company with it. Say there is you, mister A and mister B. You invest 40k, A 25k and B 35k. That’s a total of 100k. You own the company for 40%, A for 25% and B for 35%. If the company goes bankrupt, only the company goes bankrupt and not you and A/B.</li>
<li>Partnership in Company - This is a bit similar to <span class="hashtag">#2</span>, but here you and other owners have full responsibility if your company goes bankrupt.</li>
<li>One man company - Here is only 1 person the owner, and has full responsibility.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now I don’t know wich kind Jagex is, but I do know that they are not <span class="hashtag">#1</span> and <span class="hashtag">#4</span>. First of all that 500k is a rough estimate of what they get. But there are more things that go on a balance (= overview of what you own and what debts you have). Think of investments (I can’t think of any that Jagex can do atm, but they sure do invest). They also have to pay other companies for their services, like accountants, advertisers, maybe they lease cars, etc… And they have to reserve money for times with economic downfall too. They can’t just fire everyone, you get a few weeks notice in wich sallary’s have to be paid.</p>
<p>So my conclusion is that the Gower’s do earn more then the normal person, but they really dont earn millions a year. (It also has to be divided by 3 or 4, I don’t know how many Gower’s there are :P)</p>

<p>You’re the first person I’ve ever seen to actually make a statement that shows they understand how money works, lol.</p>
<p>On the RS forums, there’s usually a daily topic about how “O jagx gets 5m a mondt den why don we get r gud upd8s?”</p>
<p>After reading through about 20 replies to that topic, half of them were “YEA JAGDIX WHY DON WE GUT UPDATS”, the other half were flaming. No one bothered to explain that they have over 100 workers that they have to pay, building rent, paying for the servers, taxes, etc.</p>

<p>Now it averages around 200,000+ a day, and there are more member worlds, then f2p worlds(I think?)<br>
Each member world always has 1000+ people on at a time(during the day)</p>
<p>So these guys are making big…</p>
<p>And I don’t think there in it for money, they already make enough.<br>
I think because members are gold(stars on the list) they did that.</p>
