    <description>well latley i have been cleaning up a delta client and source and its going pretty well. But ive come to a problem because i removed the retarded run orb. I cant seem to find where the green number&#39;s inside of it are held. Is this a client sided problem? Because i&#39;ve been searching through the source for awhile. I thought it was just an awful run energy coding job so it showed up like that, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case. I&#39;ve checked my classes and searched the general energy codes. Any help?</description>
