    <description>Hello people, it&#39;s me here again. It&#39;s been a few months since I&#39;ve returned here *sigh*

Anyways moving on. I am adding these new ranks to my server: Server Support
                                                                                      Premium Member

Firstly I have the crowns all added, the ranks created and set up in the server and etc.
Now the problem is:

Let&#39;s say I was a premium member, and the other guy wasn&#39;t.
If I talk my crown would show for me. But for the other guy, he wouldn&#39;t be able to see the crown... 

Any ideas?

(I posted this topic here because I&#39;m not sure if this has to do with server side or client side work)</description>
