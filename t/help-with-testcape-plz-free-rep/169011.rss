    <description>i have a few problems with pking in testscape, can any1 help

1. when you use &quot;ice burst&quot; it frezes every time, but never hits above 0
(same with other ancient spells)

2. bloods have been turned into ecto tokens by the source owner guy because of server crashes.. but the ecto tokens don&#39;t register as bloods in the magic menu. I try to use a spell and it just says i dont have enough bloods. so i went and changed ecto tokens back to bloods and it crashed and i lost my data, so i went back and changed everything back to ecto&#39;s but they don&#39;t register as bloods, (and yes i made sure every symbol for blood rune, aka 565, is ecto token, 4278.) 

3. in normal magiks, no spell hits on pvp except earth blast and it always hits 0, and i don&#39;t knwo about wave spells cause i can&#39;t get bloods

4. in ancients, every spell hits 4 and does no effect until u get ice burst then the lower spells hit nothing, and ice burst freezes but hits nothing.</description>
