    <title>Keep 3 items upon death?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/keep-3-items-upon-death/223435</link>
    <description>How would I make it so you keep 3 items when you die?

It currently only keeps 1, and that came with the source. 

Would be nice for 3 most valuable items but it does not matter.


Tell me if you need more...

[code]    addItem(keepItem, keepItemAmount);
     if(keepItem2 != 0)
     addItem(keepItem2, keepItemAmount2);
     if(keepItem3 != 0)
     addItem(keepItem3, keepItemAmount3);[/code]

All I know is the ! means not

Edited, question: would removeing the ! fix it or something? Or does this code have anything special to it?

Yes, I KNOW, I am a dumbass so just tell me. :)</description>
