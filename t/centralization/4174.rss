    <title>Centralization?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/centralization/4174</link>
    <description>Has anyone made an effort to standardize/centralize server emulators? A shared login or chat server maybe? How about a useful friends network? Would people even care enough to add support for such a thing to their servers? Would anyone be able to reliably host something like that?</description>

<p>lol idea stealer :eek:<br>
I’ve got something similar for my rsc - it’s just that I’m probably never going to finish it, so I thought maybe emuRS2land would be interested. How are you coming with that anyway?</p>
<p>As for SilabNet, yeah, that’s cool - you could use IRC but then you have to deal with it actually being an open IRC channel instead of a custom thing you can control/authenticate as you please. With a projected load that low you could probably even add some nice encryption to everything and not suffer (why encrypt RS chat? because we can).</p>
<p>Have you ever thought of adding friendlist support that could tie in with the client? If I remember correctly, the RS2 F/I-list data consist of lists of username-as-long-int’s that can easily be created by any program (everyone’s seen Jagex’s encoding by now right?). It’s simple to store them locally in a SQL database - if management ease is more of a concern than speed - or in some text/binary format otherwise.</p>

<p>silab, it would be better, in my opinion, to use irc for your servers to communicate rather than make some icky server and deal with sockets.</p>
