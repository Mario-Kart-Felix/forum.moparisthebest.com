    <description>I think this is in right section.. If not mod please move it.

What would be the best way to get players on my RSPS? Besides paying websites to advertise for me. I advertised on rs-ps and got like players but now back down to 4.. Any ideas?</description>

You could also have you or some people wait by the area where new players spawn and tell them some cool stuff about the server or give them something.</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
<p>We cannot advertise other websites on this forum.</p>
<p>I can suggest using a search engine and searching for: “RSPS Server list”.</p>
<p>That’s about all I can tell you!</p>
<p>Thank you, good luck!</p>

<p>You’ll need to get out there and advertise your server!</p>
<p>Many places allow you to advertise for free, and to keep your server in the top rankings, make sure you keep the down time to a minimum, the more it’s down, the more it will drop down the list.</p>
<p>Try this for a start: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php</a></p>
<p>Thank you![/quote]</p>
<p>Registered it there, 100% uptime, Anyone know any good places to advertise to get players?</p>
