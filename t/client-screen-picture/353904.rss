    <description>Hey guys...Everything anybody has helped me with so far has worked...so..I&#39;m gonna ask one more question and if you guys can answer it, I will be full satisfied.

You know how some people make custom client screen pictures...NOT WITH PAINT but with words that actually looks like its in the game....like not created by paint...but some super major awesome uber program??
Well can you guys send me in the right direction on how to make my own?? I haven&#39;t found a tut and one of you will probably end of seeing one I didn&#39;t see...and yes...I&#39;ll look harder next time!
