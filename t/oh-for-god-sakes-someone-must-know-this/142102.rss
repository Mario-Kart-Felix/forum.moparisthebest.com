    <description>I hav all the int&#39;s for making new items, objects, npcs, ect... but I DONT KNOW HOW TO UNPACK/REPACK CACHE!!! I spent 3 months looking for the chance to learn how to make new items, and the only thing that is stopping me is not being able to find a program that unpacks cache, and no nowing HOW to unpack cache. Plus I hear repacking is ALOT harder. Can someone PLZ help me!!!!!!!!! And I REALLY hate begging, but I just cant find the stupid link. And all the links that I do find are broken. I can never trust mopar to hold an old file, because its deleted like a few days after its posted, or wrongly locked... PLZ HELP!!!! lol, srry for begging, and I dont mean to be mean to any mods/admins.
