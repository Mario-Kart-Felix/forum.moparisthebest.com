    <title>Making a dual-world 317 server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-dual-world-317-server/399789</link>
    <description>Hi. I have played some servers that have &quot;two worlds&quot; that are acting like 2 different servers. Because that&#39;s what it is, is 2 servers running at once. I have found a way to have 2 servers running at once loading the character files from both servers because the &quot;two world&quot; server have 2 sets of character files.

Here&#39;s how you do it. Note that this is probably more work then it&#39;s worth.

[b]Step 1[/b]

Run your world 1 server (your regular one)

[b]Step 2[/b]

Find your server.java file and open it. Search for &quot;listen&quot;. The port should be set to 43594 or 5555. Change it to 43595. Make sure you set one of the listening ports to 43595 and the other one to 5555 or 43595. Compile your server then run it. Now you have 2 servers running from the same set of files.

[b]UPDATING[/B]

Updating will now be a pain. When you do a update you have to set the port back to 43594 then compile then redo the steps above.

[b]OTHER GLITCHES[/B]

Now you open up your server to duping, not losing items when you die and a character file may not save correctly. Players could now login to both servers at the same time. If they do this one of their profiles won&#39;t save correctly.

[b]Last Part[/b]

To do this you will either have to have a client that is able to switch ports by clicking change world or change port tool or something or you will have to make a world 1 and world 2 client. World 2 running the port as 43595.

If I missed something or something does not work please tell me and I will fix it.</description>

that is wrong, consider to what you are saying. both servers can NOT run on the same port, it will say “port already used”<br>
so change it to say <blockquote>Step 2
