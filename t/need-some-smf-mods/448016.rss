    <title>Need some smf mods</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-smf-mods/448016</link>
    <description>There really isn&#39;t a request or forum section so I just posted in the general questions. Staff can feel free to move this to wherever they feel it is best.

I recently installed some smf forums on my website and I am looking for some helpful mods or possibly just some tips on how to do a few things.

The version of smf I am using: [IMG]http://i49.tinypic.com/2znpmdj.png[/img]

Some things I am looking to do:

1. Remove post count related title if user has a title such as administrator. For example, administrators don&#39;t have Administrator and Moparian or another post count related rank.

2. I am wondering what system MoparScape uses to display rank images but also the stars. I also want to know how to display several rank images. Normally what I would do to display the rank image is just change it from loading the star to instead loading the rank image. However, some users have more images and can be easily added/removed and I am wondering if there is a mod that does it or what. 
Example: [IMG]http://i50.tinypic.com/1rstox.png[/img]

Both tL and Davidi2 are great examples of what I am looking for. Not only do they still have stars and images, but they also have multiple images.


I will add more things to this as I go. If you have any modifications or methods on how to do what I ask, please post :)

EDIT: ONLY NEED THE ONE TO SHOW MAIN RANK AND REMOVE POST RANK IF YOU HAVE A PRIMARY GROUP NOT BASED ON POSTS

EDIT2: I have everything I need, thanks to those who helped via msn and pm</description>
