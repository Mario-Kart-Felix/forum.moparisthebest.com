    <description>I don&#39;t see how Brittan is to blame here, so far Jade Goodie hasn&#39;t been racist(as far as I know) yet on the news she&#39;s to blame?? Jermaine Jackson called Jade&#39;s mother white trash? Is that not racism?</description>

              <p>[quote=“moparisthebest, post:5, topic:48619”]Unfortunately the way that the world works currently is that the only people that can be racist are white (and male usually)</p>
<p>For example here in the USA there are PLENTY of scholarships for black males, black females, hispanics, asians, and all minorities.  However when I need a scholarship, a white male scholarship is nowhere to be found, I got the shaft because of my race, that is racism in my book.[/quote]</p>
<p>This is very true.  I thought that the whole Civil Rights thing was to make blacks and whites equal, there should be equal opprotunities for both, but instead it has gotten patchy.  Some places white people are the minorities, sometimes the other races are.  Also it’s retarded to think that the only people who could be racist are whites.</p>

<p>I like the show. I can be racist. I don’t give a shit.</p>
<p>(Plus i only really watch the summer one because the celebrities are all unknowns in the winter one and i find it more interesting to see people from the public in the house (and the house is new and pretty))</p>

Unfortunately the way that the world works currently is that the only people that can be racist are white (and male usually)</p>
<p>For example here in the USA there are PLENTY of scholarships for black males, black females, hispanics, asians, and all minorities.  However when I need a scholarship, a white male scholarship is nowhere to be found, I got the shaft because of my race, that is racism in my book.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>yeah i agree with that, around here if i call someone a paki, i can get beaten up and put in a cell all night, but if they call me a chav, they get to walk freely</p>
<p>is jade the fat one that keeps getting angry? if so, i bet this was planned, cause she’s the one that people like to watch losing it, cussing, swearing and being offencive</p>
<p>also look at this way, big brother just got world coverage, and its rating are falling, IMO this is a publicity stunt[/quote]</p>
<p>Chav has nothing to do with race.</p>
<p>But yeh pakis will hit you for calling them that and black people will like… eat your brains if you call them a nigga. But us white people, just because of our ancestors slave business, are treated like crap and get called “white bois”.</p>
<p>Heres an example:</p>
<p>Me and my mates are jyst walking along then a group of black people go around a door and say “20p to pass” then when we just dont say anything and try to get passed they are like “OMG you white people just discriminate against us niggas” and we are like “what!?” then they just go “Stupid white kids” and walk off.</p>
<p>Back in the old days they would be branded and working in my cotton fields, but these days they are like all superior.</p>
<p>Also, a Eastern or black person would easily be able to sue someone for a racist offense. But has anyone heard of a white person suing for racism and winning? I think not.</p>

Your pretty ignorant. Why the fuck would you call anyone from an Asian background a ‘paki’. Calling someone a ‘paki’ and calling someone a ‘chav’ is nowhere near the same thing.<br>
[/quote]<br>
im emphasise the ‘if’</p>
<p>also, just in case theres some misunderstanding, my definition of a chav is a derogatary term for white, working class person, whats yours?</p>
<p>okay, another example, calling someone a darkie and being called a cracker[/quote]</p>
<p>Chav doesn’t mean white, working class where I live. Where I live it means: Council house, no job, on the dole, if a girl pregnant at around 16 etc… Basically Vicky Pollard from the comedy show Little Britain.</p>

<p>I was reading about this on the front page of the newspaper (again…) and they said that Big Brother has shamed the UK. I was like wtf? Racism is everywhere these days, regardless of the country. I think this racism on Big Brother thing has been blown out of proportion by the media.</p>
