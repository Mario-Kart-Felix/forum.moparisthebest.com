    <title>Why was Gorilla Sto/CopyRight banned again?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-was-gorilla-sto-copyright-banned-again/333194</link>
    <description>Hi, just curious. I was reading this topic:

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,429169.0.html

and was slightly confused why he was banned again? There are several members on this forum that were permanently banned but have come back and have been accepted. He seemed like he didn&#39;t want to be that annoying guy on the forum soooo why not just [b]not ban him[/b]? Sounds crazy right? I don&#39;t even understand why the topic was locked. Anyway, there&#39;s my 2 cents.

              <p>I can’t believe you guys have forgotten the real reason for why we responded so harshly to him.</p>
<p>Copyright joined in with JDB’s fun when JDB discovered that global moderators could create other global moderator accounts.<br>
Copyright asked for, and received, such an account, and then used it to move internal threads into public forum sections, to ban/mute a large number of users, and to be disruptive in general.<br>
Perhaps I remember more so than the others because it was Mopar and I on at the time that all of the cleaning up took place, which was a real pain in everybody’s arse.</p>

<p>He is to remain banned.</p>

I banned him. To my knowledge any person with multiple accounts is supposed to be banned.</p>
<p>No one should be exempt. A prime example was when Wales33 was made a moderator and then was found to have 2 or 3 other accounts leading to him being demoted and banned.<br>

Whats your suggestion to him being unbanned? Go on IRC? Going on IRC for something like that is a fucking joke.[/quote]</p>
<p>I never suggested he should get unbanned. In my opinion he should definitely be banned, permanently.</p>

<p>Making a thread does not seem mature to me, which he claimed to be. All it does is flamebait.</p>
<p>I locked the topic because of the amount of flaming going on.</p>
