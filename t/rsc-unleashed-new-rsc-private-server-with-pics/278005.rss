<p>Doesn’t suck as much as you not being able to spell “server”, to be honest.</p>
<p>Edit: I know that you’re saying that because of Yong Min taking your “gamble”. It was probably the only thing that you could code without any errors… unless someone else did it for you.</p>

If you want this server to become popular, you have to add something that other servers don’t have.</p>
<p>At the moment, this is a generic EasyRSC server. Not very appealing.<br>

Tbh I think has to do more with the advertising, stability of the server, and the way things are ran.Take rsca for example…It didn’t have anything really “new” at all. The reason it became popular was up time, mature staff, and new advertising ideas. Try Getting on youtube and searching “how to play rsc for free.” A full tutorial comes up showing how to register for rsca (Not so small on views if I might add). Obviously If anyone is going to make a decent server they will have to learn what worked and what didn’t work from past servers.[/quote]</p>
<p>RSCA has alot of stuff that nobody knows about, from what I’ve overheard. It has tons of stability upgrades and under the hood updates. It’s also really close to original RSC.</p>
