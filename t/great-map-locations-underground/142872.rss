    <title>Great Map Locations (Underground)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/great-map-locations-underground/142872</link>
    <description>In most of the servers I have played on, The underground areas of Runescape have been left untouched, so here are a few good ones I have found that can maybe spark your imagination. You can access them using the ::tele (x) (Y) command.

Name	                                                                                                       X-Pos	     Y-Pos
L-Shape unknown land. Good position to develop. Slightly south of archery guild.     	2630	      9351
Lot’s of space to build new things. Possibly a city.

Temple of Ikov. Good to turn into a fighting arena.	                                           2658	          9828

Tunnel from lumbridge cellar.	                                                                          3222 	         9618

Square Room with shapes. Good for puzzle games. (Below duel arena)	                 3364	        9640

Duel arena. Directly above puzzle room (above)	                                                   3364	          3240

Glarials Tomb. A small Tomb, nothing special really.	                                            2542	   9818

Not sure what this is. Could be a good fight arena.	                                            2387	  9816

The gnome workshop for making Gliders. Possibly good for training area.	                    2396	   9874 

Possible site for a PK fightpit. With possible viewing area’s at each side.	                2402	       9703

A good site for mage/range training.	                                                                2397	        9606 

Castle wars underground area. Rocks block exit, so this could make a 	                    2401	    9503
very good fighting area. Ladders DO work though.

Underground maze looking place. Could be great for a mini-game.	                             2405	    9426

More to Come...

On a further note, if you want to post your own ideas with some suggestions than post them below. BTW, before some retard say I leeched these locations from his mums house or his bin or something, I literally sat for the last 30 minutes and searched for these locations. Sorry about the layout. I couldn&#39;t work out the tables :P. Hope they [u]help[/u] (being the help and support forum).</description>
