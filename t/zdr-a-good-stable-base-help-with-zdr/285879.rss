    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/zdr-a-good-stable-base-help-with-zdr/285879</link>
    <description>Hey guys

i was thinking of using a ZDR base , i played it once before when it was up and i liked it and it didnt lagg for me , i need to know if its a good stable base and is it good for non-lagg when up to higher amount of players.

Thanks and there is another thing , if i wanted to use say... a delta client with the hp run energy and prayer energy at the top right , (bluurs client) how whould i set up all the items and objects so it works with ZDR? 

or if anyone knows of a client that works with ZDR because the 1 it has with it is closed source and i dont know how to change the server ip ,

thanks for reading and any help is much appreciated,

And ohh yea , is it possable to re-open a closed source client? i know it sounds stupid but...[br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 28, 2009, 09:15:09 am[/size][hr]anyone? :(</description>
