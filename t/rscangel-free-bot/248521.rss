    <description>[center]I am not sure if this is legal or not.

[size=14pt][b]AND I WILL DELETE THIS IF IT IS ILLEGAL![/b][/size]

[b][size=14pt]IDEA:[/size][/b]
But has anyone ever heard of Rscangel?
It&#39;s a private 24/7 server dedicated to Runescape Classic.




[b][size=14pt]PLAN:[/size][/b]
And there is working bots out, but you also need to pay for them.
So I had an idea to find a few old bots and attempt to mess around with a few files and get it to work with RSCAngel server.
It worked!
So my plan is to get it to work almost flawlessly and for FREE release, or I may just keep it private to a few friends that helped.
But anyways, I need a few people to help me edit/create a few other files that I have no idea where to start, and what type of program to use to begin with.  We also need to develope a sleeper that will WORK!  Which shouldn&#39;t be that hard.  I still am a beginner to this type of coding language, but I CAN learn fast.




[b][size=14pt]INFO:[/size][/b]
And now I somebody(s) to help me decompile some compiled information, and change a few settings.
All I really need is somebody to decompile a few files that I will send you. (.Jag, .Mem, etc.) And I could probaly finish the rest from there.  And if your interested you can also help with a few other things.



[b][size=14pt]OTHER:[/size][/b]
I think I have a great idea going, and it already works great besides the sleeper.
I plan on changing the display of everything, name, commands, speed, config, etc.
And also, if you switch a few settings around, it will work on any other RSC private server.

[b][size=12pt]Please post or message me on MSN if you are interested.[/size][/b]


[b]MIGHT ADD MORE![/b]

<p>Ok, I have a bot that works on RSCAngel private server.<br>
And I am wondering how I can decompile a few files to edit the display, speed, commands, etc.</p>
<p>If you would like, I can upload 1 of the files onto rapidshare or something so you can see what I am talking about.</p>
<p>Sorry if I this hard to read.<br>
It’s hard to put in words really.</p>
<p>So basicly, I am looking for somone to help me develop this bot more.<br>
To create a decent bot for RSCAngel.</p>
<p>And it may seem like a dumb idea, but I am doing this mostly for the experience and as a hobby for now.<br>
And I think I have a lot of learning.</p>
<p>I’ve coded before, and I get the idea on what to edit.  But only when the file is decompiled, instead of in byte and any other [][][1]1[][][] language.</p>
<p>I hope that sums a little of it up.</p>
