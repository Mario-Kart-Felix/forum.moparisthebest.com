    <description>Do you think implementing runecrafting would negatively affect gameplay balance in RSC?

[code]	/**
	 * Can&#39;t figure out what this one is for, either.
	 */
	public int groundItemVar;[/code]

This variable (from GameObjectDef.java) is actually the pixel y offset of items that are placed on game objects (think tables, dolmens, altars etc.) in case people still hadn&#39;t worked out what it is. That&#39;s how I got the air rune to hover over the table (and is also an easy way to identify which altar&#39;s which considering no one has bothered to look into model/skin editing yet). I&#39;d add tiaras but I used up all my sprite editing skills on blanking that magic rune. Every altar is in the game, same as RS2 (map location-wise) and there are a few &#39;rune stone&#39; (Rune Essence) mines around my map.

Anyway, my point is, it&#39;s possible. My question is, is it practical?</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I think the reason no one has added an RSC-clone of agility is not because they’re incapable of it, but because they can’t see a reason to bother. I haven’t. Maybe if agility was given more weight to the game, if it was made to affect certain aspects of gameplay to actually make the skill worth while. I think it’s original reason was just to add restrictions to areas/quests to make p2p players play longer (and pay longer), which is a normal MMORPG tactic. Considering the attention span of the average private RSC server player is about 10 seconds, no one wants to waste their time on a useless skill. These days, if you don’t login with 60 thousands sharks in your bank and a set of full rune, they move on to a server where you do.</p>
<p>But I’m not talking about the life span of your private servers, I don’t really care because personally, I don’t play them (but I do check them out). I’m talking about the people who want to learn. There’s really not much in RSC private servers xEnt, I know that. I mean between Tewl and Jagex, server owners are pretty much destined to be buttfucked. But this forum wasn’t originally created so that people could advertise their own forums and servers. It was created to help people learn programming by a RS-oriented hands-on approach, and that’s what I’m talking about. And if there are people still here who aren’t at all interested in that, I think it’s time they moved on to a new game or something, because they won’t find any entertainment here.</p>
<p>Before I started studying as a game designer/programmer, decent and fun sandboxes like RSCD were hard to find. This is an excellent tool for people to get a practical example of how to modify and create content for a game. Don’t even bother trying to sell your servers, because Jagex will nail you as soon as they can be bothered to fork out the equivalent (to most of us) of a few cents. Maybe you’ll get away with it for a while, maybe you’ll quit while you’re ahead and make a few hundred bucks. In the long run, it’s not really worth the trouble. The only reason RSCDaemon lasted so long is because it was the first of its kind (RSC-wise).</p>
<p>And as far as Runecrafting goes, it’s really a simple case of taking from the different existing skills, like fishing or smithing. You use an object, and in return, certain item(s) are replaced and you’re given exp in the skill. And you place certain restrictions on which items can be made at what levels.</p>
<p><code>.   .   .
if(command.equals("runecraft on"))
{
    handleRunecrafting();
} else
.   .   .</code></p>
<p>[code]			private void handleRunecrafting()<br>
{<br>
final RunecraftingAltarDef def = EntityHandler.getRunecraftingAltarDef(object.getID());</p>
<pre><code>			if(owner.getMaxStat(17) &lt;= def.getReqLevel()) // Too low runecrafting lvl
			{
				owner.getActionSender().sendMessage("You need at least level " + def.getReqLevel() + " Runecrafting to use this Altar.");
			} else
			{
				if(owner.getInventory().countId(167) &lt;= 0) // Chisel
				{
					owner.getActionSender().sendMessage("You need a " + EntityHandler.getItemDef(167).getName() + " to shape the rune.");
					return;
				}
				
				int runeAmount = owner.getInventory().countId(1314); // Rune Stone

				if(runeAmount &lt;= 0)
				{
					owner.getActionSender().sendMessage("You need " + EntityHandler.getItemDef(1314).getName() + "s in your inventory to Runecraft.");
					return;
				}
				
				owner.setBusy(true);
				
		    	        Bubble bubble = new Bubble(owner, 1314); // 1314 is the Rune stone item id.
		    	
				for(Player p : owner.getViewArea().getPlayersInView())
					p.informOfBubble(bubble);
				
				if(runeAmount &gt; def.getConversionRate())
					runeAmount = def.getConversionRate();
					
				final int amount = runeAmount;
					
				owner.getActionSender().sendMessage("You place " + (amount &gt; 1 ? amount + " of your " : "one ") + EntityHandler.getItemDef(1314).getName() + (amount &gt; 1 ? "s" : "") + " on the " + EntityHandler.getGameObjectDef(object.getID()).getName() + "...");
				
				world.getDelayedEventHandler().add(new ShortEvent(owner) 
				{
					public void action() 
					{
						owner.setBusy(false);
						owner.getInventory().remove(1314, amount);
						owner.getInventory().add(new InvItem(def.getRune(), amount));
						owner.incExp(Formulae.getStatIndex("runecrafting"), (int)(def.getExp() * amount), true);
						owner.getActionSender().sendInventory();
						owner.getActionSender().sendStat(Formulae.getStatIndex("runecrafting"));
						
						Bubble bubble = new Bubble(owner, def.getRune());
		    	
						for(Player p : owner.getViewArea().getPlayersInView())
							p.informOfBubble(bubble);
							
						owner.getActionSender().sendTeleBubble(object.getX(), object.getY(), false);
						owner.getActionSender().sendSound("spellok");
							
						owner.getActionSender().sendMessage("You retrieve " + (amount &gt; 1 ? amount + " " : "one ") + EntityHandler.getItemDef(def.getRune()).getName() + (amount &gt; 1 ? "s" : "") + ".");
					}
				});
			}
		}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>And the Runecrafting defs are loaded by XML like the other skills. Fairly easy if you apply yourself for a good two hours. And yes, I know this isn’t a complete Runecrafting skill as compared to RS2, but it’s a simple example of the possibilities.</p>
<p>Also, anyone interested in what I said about quests might like to see something I dug up with google that looks pretty sweet - <a href="http://littletutorials.com/2008/05/10/script-thy-java-app/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://littletutorials.com/2008/05/10/script-thy-java-app/</a>. I haven’t tested efficiency compared to simple class loading yet, but from what I can see, it looks like a cool way to add scriptable quests (or anything, really) to your server/client.</p>

Right now the only good thing is to develop for learning purposes, or to sell it. Even once it gets sold, it won’t take a long time for it to get leaked.</p>
<p>As far as runecrafting goes, id choose that over agility. Because agility is just plain stupid (especially how RSC has it) But i remember i did summoning on a demonik source and nobody at all liked it.</p>

              <p>Shit… Can’t beleive i read all that, but yet we finally have one of the most clued up people on here, who knows what he is saying, yet the last bit, it will never happen. People will always be at each others throat it’s impossible for it not to be like that, unless moparscape kick all the wankers out then they will be left with less than a hundred people. But i think you anarchist have the most chance to actually create something decent, you have actually showed your willingness(if that is such a word) and desire to keep RSC Dev going, see i would love to start helping the development truth is i don’t have the knowledge, i’d love to get so deep into this and help out, just i can’t quite get the hang of java… I have been trying for the past month+, not getting anywhere yet but i am still going for it.</p>
<p>I think the main problem is the good programmers, will not release any decent work since moparscape is full of people who know nothing, only how to edit a couple of variables and swap things about. Probably the main reason no decent stuff such as quest systems have been released i can garuntee 1 or 2 are out their. Also a random change in topic, what you said about the RS2 is totally true, rsc was so simple and original that’s what made everybody love it so much, then they invented RS2, which totally surpassed RSC with succession but yet it did not appeal to alot of the RSC players, mainly what made me hate it is, the 3D graphics and the way they made it so much more complicated and un-original.</p>
<p>Well someday i hope a couple of the clued up and mature programmers here will actually try to make somthing decent, instead of sitting in the background.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>The only reason I refuse to play RS2 is the fact that they adapted every cliché MMORPG combat style. I only played RSC to pk. Yeah right, so every kid and his dog made a PK server. That’s not pking. Those pk servers are jokes. Pking was a skill like any other, that had rewards and risks involved. If you had high smithing, you could make r2hs. If you were good at catching, you could pk r2hs. I loved the simplicity of RSC, but when RS2 came out with all it’s 3-Dimensional goodness, the game lost its simplicity and its originality. It’s still a good game and I respect its success, but it’s not a game that appeals to me.</p>
<p>That being said, there are a number of things RS2 has added or fixed that RSC servers could borrow from. Killing monsters to pick up these special stones just doesn’t make sense to me - how did they come into existence in the first place? If they’re impossible for supposedly intelligent ‘human’ players to create (other than that motherfucking ::item command that effectively lead to the ruin of RSC servers), how did goblins get their hands on them? Runecrafting is a skill that does makes sense to me, even if it isn’t practical in RSC gameplay.</p>
<p>Another question I’d like to raise is quests. Why haven’t they been implemented yet? The concept behind them really isn’t that difficult to grasp. I suppose it would be fairly easy to hard-code the quests into the server, but that’s impractical. Which leaves only one alternative - scripting. I guess that’s where everyone who has tried to code a questing system has got stuck? Whether it be through Java class loading or Python interpretation, why hasn’t someone created a basic quest system? I mean even STS had custom a user-made .txt script parsing engine for christ’s sake, the easiest of the easy custom-made scripting languages.</p>
<p>Think about it, what did the HARDEST RSC quest consist of? Collecting items? Killing NPCs? Just use on(event) triggers. Easy (pseudo):</p>
<p>[code]<br>
on(“item_pickup”, int item_id)<br>
{<br>
if(questStage == 1)<br>
{<br>
if(item_id == special_quest_item_id)<br>
{<br>
questStage = 2;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>on(“npc_killed”, int npc_id)<br>
{<br>
if(questStage == 2)<br>
{<br>
if(npc_id == special_quest_npc)<br>
{<br>
questStage = QuestConstants.QUEST_COMPLETE; // triggers quest completion<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p>I suppose anyone who’s successfully created a quest system (I’m certain there’s people out there who have) don’t advertise the fact to avoid annoying “noob fame” and a bombardment of stupid questions.</p>
<p>Meh, I’ve got off topic, but only specifically to the title of this thread. I’m still poking at the same issue here - why the hell has RSC dev stopped dead with RSCD’s leak? I mean, seriously, you’re given the holy grail of RSC server source codes, and you choose to shit in it instead of drink from it?</p>
<p>RSCD was hardly a completed project, and has so much more potential to grow than people have given it credit for. Come on guys, if you want to educate yourselves, think outside the box. I’m sure Reines is dead set disgusted, like any good programmer, that his hard work is being abused by 11 year olds making half-assed attempts at StorkPK rip-offs.</p>
<p>Be original! Stork was. Reines was. What’s stopping you guys? The fact that most of you are at eachother’s throats 24/7 for the most ridiculous reasons possible? Grow up, stop arguing and consider why you’re here. The rules state that this is an educational community, if I’m not mistaken. Are you here to learn? If you answered yes, then do something about it. If you answered no, then find somewhere else to waste your time.</p>

<p>This variable (from GameObjectDef.java) is actually the pixel y offset of items that are placed on game objects (think tables, dolmens, altars etc.) in case people still hadn’t worked out what it is. That’s how I got the air rune to hover over the table (and is also an easy way to identify which altar’s which considering no one has bothered to look into model/skin editing yet). I’d add tiaras but I used up all my sprite editing skills on blanking that magic rune. Every altar is in the game, same as RS2 (map location-wise) and there are a few ‘rune stone’ (Rune Essence) mines around my map.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point is, it’s possible. My question is, is it practical?</p>
