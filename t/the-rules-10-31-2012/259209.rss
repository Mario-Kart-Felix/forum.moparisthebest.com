    <description>[b]Foreword:[/b]

The staff reserve the right to interpret these rules any way they see fit. The following rules are more like guidelines. You shouldn&#39;t be looking for loopholes in them, rather, you should just get along with them. We&#39;re looking for users that use common sense. For example, we would prefer a user that knows, just because something isn&#39;t on the rules, that it it isn&#39;t necessarily allowed.
 
[anchor=ideals][size=10pt][b][u]Ideals:[/u][/b][/size]

[ul][li]We are not anti-leech. If you respect our community and our ideas, feel free to ask questions and they will be kindly answered if you follow the rules. Answer to questions that others ask if you know the answer or offer useful content, [b]otherwise remain silent[/b].[/li]
[li]We don&#39;t talk about things we don&#39;t know. This is an informative community.[/li]
[li] We do not care about post count alone. If someone has high post count but most of it is spam, we hate them. If someone has a high post count with informative posts, we love them. The higher count, the more we hate/love them.[/li]
[li]We do [b]not[/b] make spelling mistakes on purpose. We use &quot;you&quot; not &quot;u&quot;, we use &quot;why&quot; not &quot;y&quot; etc.[/li][/ul]


[size=10pt][b][u]Rules:[/u][/b][/size]
[anchor=rule1][b]Rule 1:[/b]
Moderators lock topics/remove posts and topics/hand infractions to users at their own discretion as required to foster a positive community. Any disagreement with a staff member&#39;s decision is to be resolved through the use of the PM system. Any public disputes are [b]unacceptable[/b] and punishable.

[anchor=rule2][b] Rule 2:[/b]
Everybody is equal, don&#39;t treat people worse than you do others(E.G., don&#39;t isolate someone and flame them).

[anchor=rule3][b]Rule 3:[/b]
Posts should be knowledgeable, try to put some effort into them, it&#39;ll save hassle and stop you from looking like an idiot.

[anchor=rule4][b]Rule 4:[/b]
We only have [b]one[/b] forum account per person, you can use the same account for [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf]Moparscape[/url] and [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf]Moparisthebest.[/url]

[anchor=rule5][b]Rule 5:[/b]
Do not advertise without permission from a Global Moderator or an Administrator. Anyone advertising maliciously will be permanently banned.

[anchor=rule6][b]Rule 6:[/b]
Pornographic content is not allowed under any circumstances. This includes images, links, or deep-rooted discussions regarding watching, sharing, creating, or otherwise being involved with pornographic media. Pornography may be referenced and discussed up to the point where it does not violate the above statement.

Explicit content or otherwise questionable content may be allowed, but we expect users to use the &#39;NSFW&#39; rule when posting ([b]N[/b]ot [b]S[/b]afe [b]F[/b]or [b]W[/b]ork). Users are expected to use this tag in the title to inform other users the topic may contain explicit content. Please use your discretion when posting such content.

[anchor=rule7][b]Rule 7:[/b]
A moderator&#39;s decision is final, if you have a problem with it, pm an administrator. Trying to resolve it through a thread will result in a heavier punishment.

[anchor=rule8][b]Rule 8:[/b]
We do not sell anything on this site, period.  This includes offering &#39;rewards&#39; for donations or anything like that.  Furthermore, all requests of price or value for any property related to the game RuneScape is disallowed on these boards.

[anchor=rule12][b]Rule 12:[/b]
We respect each other and other communities. We do [b]not[/b] flame. There is to be no fighting on the forums.
