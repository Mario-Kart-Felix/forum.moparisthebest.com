    <description>Hello friends,

I have been working a lot with sprites recently, oh you know those notes, custom capes and other misc stuff. I am currently working on a sprite editor that allows artists to create content with the ability to use current sprites as a &quot;template&quot; for their work. When they are done they simply &quot;save&quot; and their work is packed into the cache. This sprite editor is unique because it allows for artists to use all the different views at the same time.

[b]IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS LET ME KNOW[/b]

So below are a list of features which will be implemented :
-load templates (monsters, humans)
-load sprites (will put the sprites you&#39;re interested in working with on the templates)
-inbuilt paint (for editing)
-save

RSC requires 17 different views so I will probably run with a 3 x 6 grid horizontally. 

Using the paint would be something like this...
