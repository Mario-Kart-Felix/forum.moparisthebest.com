    <title>The RuneEmu Server Project. More people needed</title>

Recent Changes:
---------------------------------------------------------

-I have unwillingly popularized the word &quot;serious&quot; on topic titles, and, apparently, it is now being used by the most pathetic &quot;projects&quot; to lure people into signing up for forums. I have removed the word from the title since it has no meaning anymore. 

-As of 22/12/2007, new team members will need to pass a small (and easy) test. For more information, scroll down to &quot;Requirements&quot;.
There will be more than one test available, and you only need to pass one of them (you can choose which one). Most people who are actually willing to make some effort should be able to pass, if not the C++ or DB test, the Usefulness test.

Currently available tests:
-Medium difficulty C/C++ test.
-Usefulness test. (Exact nature of this test may vary).
-DB &amp; MySQL &amp; light C/C++.



---------------------------------------------------------
Original Post:
---------------------------------------------------------

I have noticed that at the moment there are very few, if any, &quot;professionally&quot; made runescape servers. Although Runescape is relatively simplistic for a MMORPG, it is still a MMORPG. MMORPG servers are especially complex projects, which involve many areas of Computer Sciences knowledge, including Relational Databases, Distributed Systems, Event-Controlled Systems, Multi-Threaded design, Object Oriented Design, and others. 

With that in mind, I have decided to start creating a new, well designed server.


[b]The Main Language[/b]

The language will, of course, be C++. C++ is one of the most widely used professionally used programming languages. Most games, if not all, are written in C++. That includes Quake 3, Quake 4, Half Life 2, World of Warcraft, Starwars Galaxies, Warcraft 3...

In fact, the Runescape server is probably done in C++ too. The Runescape client is done in Java because Jagex is a browser-games firm. If you don&#39;t believe this, have a look at jagex corporal page, at http://www.jagex.com. You will notice that they are hiring programmers who know either Java OR C++.

[b]Database[/b]

We can basically state that a serious MMORPG server needs to make use of a modern relational database. The server will use MySQL, as it is free, fast, and powerful.


[b]Scripting language[/b]

Having to re-compile the server to add minor features is far from professional. Modern games make use of scripting languages to define their behaviour, so that new features are safer and faster and easier to add (I think Jagex calls theirs RuneScript). Although it is soon to talk about this, we will probably be using Lua or Python as our scripting language.


[b]Server Design[/b]

Although true MMORPG servers are completelly distributed (clusters), such a design is quite complex. The first version of RuneEmu will not be fully clustered, though it will be designed in such a way that it can be modified to add full clustering support in the future.

The design of RuneEmu will be multi-layered and as modular and object oriented as possible, so that the different classes and modules are as reusable as possible.


[b]The target[/b]

The target is a very stable server, superior, especially for bigger servers, easily customizable through scripts, and efficient, able to handle many players easily thanks to a proper use of a relational database and a modern, professional and careful modular design.


[b]Who we are looking for[/b]

At the moment, we need (quite obviously) more programmers. Although someone with C++ experience would be especially nice, I know that being that strict I won&#39;t find anyone.

For that reason, everyone with some notion of programming is welcome, as long as he is willing to learn C++ and is able to follow the RuneEmu design. 

Note that as of 22/12/07, passing a small test is also required for joining. There is more than one kind of test available, and a few of them don&#39;t require C++ knowledge.

C++ is very similar to Java, so, those who know Java already have advantage.


[b]What you get[/b]

Learning is the main reward. Working on a big, complex project, with the help of someone experienced, is one of the best ways to get good at programming and C++. There are some things that you can never learn until you have worked on something like this.

Of course, we are a team, so you will get credits for what you do as well.

We also could use someone with MySQL knowledge.

If you are interested, please contact me. (Scroll down to see how you can).

[b]Requirements for joining[/b]

- Knowing what programming is. (Not much knowledge required).

- WILLINGNESS TO LEARN, and to become a good programmer.

- ABILITY TO FOLLOW my advice / RuneEmu design. 

- Passing ONE of the following tests:
   
-Medium difficulty C/C++ test.
-Usefulness test. (Exact nature of this test may vary).
-DB &amp; MySQL &amp; light C/C++.



[b]Open / Closed source[/b]

For now, the server will be closed source. Eventually though, it will probably go Open Source, at least partially.


[b]Work-flow[/b]

I will design the server, in a quite detailed way, so that not-so-experienced people don&#39;t have much trouble finding something they can do, and so that they can learn without worrying too much about messing up the design badly or adding fatal bugs.


[b]Specifics[/b]

-We will, at least at first, be using RS 317 as a client. Though as the server will be very modular and Object Oriented, it will be possible to update it to a higher version easily, once the protocol of that version has been reversed.


[b]Contact me[/b]

The preferred way to contact me is through IRC. Send a msg on irc.moparisthebest.com to ZSTARS or DUTHER, when I am online. I am usually in the channels #mopar , #moparscape , #RuneEmu and #rsreversing 

I can also be reached through a PM on these forums.

To join, we will need to meet at #RuneEmu.


[b]About me[/b]

I am mainly C/C++ programmer. I also have some knowledge of C++/CLI, Java and Delphi.

I am quite experienced on MMORPG server design and programming. 

I&#39;ve worked on several closed source emulators, and on a few open source ones.

One of the first examples would be the RevZ version of SWGEmu&#39;s Core 1. This one is Open Source. If you are curious, you can access the public SVN repository here:
http://opensvn.csie.org/SWGEmuRevZ
(Note that the original server base, called Core 1, is old and always was quite messy, so the design and source is not especially good. The design of RuneEmu is / will be much better)

              <p>Not exactly. There isn’t much automagic at this respect. Data is serialized over the network, and in the end it’s all just a bunch of signals. If a 4 bytes integer is serialized, sent over the network, and received by a different computer as the byte stream DE AD CA FE, without additional information you actually have no way of knowing the integer’s real value. It all depends on how the integer was serialized. Could be DEADCAFE, FECAADDE, or something completely different. Runescape especifically uses several different byte orders and encodings, probably to make packet sniffing / forging harder, which means that often it would be neither of the above.</p>

              <p>[quote=“zstars, post:642, topic:160753”]Indeed, Java is big endian. It is however not C++ or Windows what is little endian, but the PC x86 architecture itself. Reversing the byte order is however a trivial task. Also, it would still need to be done in Java because Runescape uses several different non standard byte orders and encodings, possibly for obfuscation purposes.</p>
<p>C++ streams are not intended for that use, so that might be the reason for your troubles. We are using some custom ByteBuffer classes, which are in a way similar to Java byte streams. If anyone wants to have a look at them, they can be found in the SVN repository, in the Shared project.[/quote]</p>
<p>Since Java is platfor independent, wouldn’t it make those changes automatically to accomidate to OS</p>

I wanted to know if I could view, or possible learn from your server development.  I am thriving to learn more on C/C++ Java.  I have been looking up videos on youtube and I own a textbook on Java and I am currently wanting to earn myself a certification.  I’m no super programmer or teacher, but I ask if I simply could join your server just to watch, or learn on Server Development.  Please send me a response to my email/messenger.<br>
