    <title>Wanting to code for an RSPS?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wanting-to-code-for-an-rsps/447071</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;ve been wanting to learn how to code in an RSPS, starting with just the basics.
Would anybody be willing to teach me? Or link me to something that could get me started?

And also, do I need to know any programming languages.</description>

<p>I’ve been using Java for about 2 years and I’d say I have a good understanding of it. But I mainly use C# because it’s AWESOMESAUCE. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Anyway, if you cover everything on that site, you should be in good standing and at least have more knowledge in Java than all the other newbies coming to MoparScape, cause I gotta tell ya; some people come here with not even knowing a thing.</p>
<p>But before you finish everything on that site, don’t jump straight into RSPS. Try to make a small DOS game. They’re fairly easy; then you should be comfortable to jump into RSPS development. Good luck!</p>
<p>Ok thanks very much!<br>
I’ve learned Javascript in the past few months, not sure if that’ll help me or not (Helped me understand some fundamentals)<br>
But thanks, I’ll check out the site and try a few games.[/quote]</p>
