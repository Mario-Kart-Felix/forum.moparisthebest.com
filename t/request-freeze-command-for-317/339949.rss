    <title>[REQUEST] Freeze command for [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/request-freeze-command-for-317/339949</link>
    <description>I was searching for a freeze command.
the idea of the command is.

when an mod do ::freeze (player) then will the player been frozen.
and cant teleport and cant logout if possible.
and the frozen player cant run away or something.
and when someone is frozen. then he get an auto message with :
You are Frozen by an admin , dont logout or you will been jailed/banned!

or something likes this!
i hope someone got this command!
