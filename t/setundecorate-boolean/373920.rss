    <title>setUndecorate boolean</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setundecorate-boolean/373920</link>
    <description>I doubt i&#39;ll get an intelligent response, or one at all. Don&#39;t bother to reply please if you do not know the answer.

You know what setUndecorate does. if you don&#39;t basically it removes native decorations from the frame, mainly this is used to remove the title bar along with the buttons at the top of a standalone applet.

setUndecorate is best used when the frame is now being shown. The problem is, the client applets call the frame. I can use set unedecorate but i leaves the frame, just undecorated. Plain white space. This is problemative because its ugly and it makes the fullscreen not quite fullscreen.

Any ideas on how i can remove the actual frame or something along those lines? Ive attempted re-arranging the calling of show along with the calling of undecorate. Nothing works so far.</description>
