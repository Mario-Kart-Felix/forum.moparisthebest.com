    <title>Looking for a long time coder</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-long-time-coder/332596</link>
    <description>Hey my server has been up for almost 2 months, i started it not knowing what a vps was, or how to add basicly anything to my server. I have learned as the month passed, but I need a PR0 CODER. I need someone that is very good at coding, and is willing to code for my server for a while, in return you will be co owner. I am currently on the moparscape server sponsor page, with 70+ players online. If you are willing to code please send me a message, or add me on msn- x-x--g--x-x@live.com
~thanks~</description>

<p>Yes I do.</p>
<p>[quote=“MrPurple436648, post:5, topic:332596”]Its actually not that hard. A “PRO Coder” could be anyone who has studied to be honest. I read TUT’s and read all through these forums for one week. Learned what i wanted to add, and take out. Whatever i wanted to know (for me) is on this forum, i just searched for it.<br>
Instead of giving someone Co-Owner to code your server, do it yourself. yes it will take time, yes a lot of time. But when you get done, you will know everything you wanted to know. And can call yourself a “Pro Coder”.</p>
<p>(I am far from a “Pro Coder” but hey im better off then some people, and it took barely anytime.)</p>
<p>And yes i think Itaiis right, if someone was a pro coder and do everything correct, they would make there out BEAST LIKE server and run it for themselves with VPS.</p>
<p>Trust me dude, everything you need is located on these fourms.</p>
<p>(All that was just a opinion to help you out, if you still want to higher someone that is fine. its your choice, just offering)[/quote]<br>
Your right.</p>
