    <title>[667]Adding/Editing drops?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-adding-editing-drops/446334</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been searching around throughout like 5 different files trying to find General Graardor so I could edit his drops and I&#39;ve had no luck finding his NPC Id.

I&#39;ve looked at dropEditor.java, NPCDrops.java, and NPC.java and nothing is coming up.
Any ideas?</description>
