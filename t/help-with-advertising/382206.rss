    <description>I Don&#39;t know if this is against the rules or not but if it is Please tell me immediately or Delete it if your a Mod. But anyways I was wondering if there were any good websites to advertise your server. And if there is any other websites like rs-ps.org. And like on that website you can buy stuff like playershare to get players, any websites like that? Thanks for your help guys         [color=limegreen] -Vheno[i][/i]m[/color]</description>

              <p>You can use status pages and buy features/spots on them to increase your player traffic. Though you can’t buy players at a set amount. You can use the Moparscape status page to advertise your server or many other status pages.</p>
<p>Moparscape offers sponsored server to increase your traffic. It works on a biding bases. Another method would be advertising using banners etc on other RSPS related communities, some offer payments for these perks. Never advertise without permission on another community as it will get your server a bad name and nasty traffic which will do harm.</p>
