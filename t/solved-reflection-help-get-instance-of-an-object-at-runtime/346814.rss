    <title>*Solved* [Reflection Help] Get instance of an object at runtime</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solved-reflection-help-get-instance-of-an-object-at-runtime/346814</link>
    <description>So I have started this java class using reflection, and set a breakpoint after it started so I can see all of its Fields, Methods, Etc.
I have an object inside of a field that I want to get.

[b]To clarify what I mean:[/b]
MainClass.a.E - E is an instance of a class that I need to get at runtime (lets say myType), since creating a new object wouldn&#39;t have been initialized with everything that I need, I cannot simply write: myType obj = new myType(), then  use obj.

[b]When I try to do:[/b]
myType newObj = MainClass.a.E, it tells me how &quot;a has protected access in this class&quot;. 

I just want to get its current running instance, that is all.
Any help at all appreciated! Thanks


-------------------------------
[b]Edit:[/b]

I finally got it to work, and got the current instance I was looking for.
This is what I did: 
[code]
Class a_class = a.getClass(); // I had an instance of a
Field E_fld = a_class.getDeclaredField(&quot;E&quot;); 
E_fld.setAccessible(true);
myType newObj = (myType)E_fld.get(a); 
[/code]

It worked like a charm!</description>
