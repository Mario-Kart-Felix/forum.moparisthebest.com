    <title>What Happened to the Dots?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-happened-to-the-dots/394925</link>
    <description>I just realized, what happened to the dots or &quot;circles&quot; that used to be posted by mods? What I mean is when someone was muted, a mod would post a yellow dot in the post that lead to the mute.

Was this changed so that it was more of a &quot;private&quot; manner?</description>

That was part of an old (and shitty) mod that ran on SMF 1.  SMF 2 comes with a built in moderation system that doesnt include the dots, and thats the one that is used here.  So we lost the dots when we upgraded from 1 to 2.</p>

<p>But people with mod rights anywhere on <span class="bbcode-i">any</span> of the three sites can see dots on profile previews (on posts at the left, where it shows rep, etc) and the moderator log</p>

              <p>It was decided not to make punishments public anymore, probably so nobody would get ‘ragged’ on about being muted or something, as well as narrowing down the work for giving a reason in the posts.</p>
