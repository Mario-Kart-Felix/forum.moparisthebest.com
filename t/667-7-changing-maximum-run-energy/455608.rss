    <title>[667/7**] Changing Maximum Run Energy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-7-changing-maximum-run-energy/455608</link>
    <description>Hey,

I was just curious to how I would go upon changing the run energy to be unlimited.

I have tried going into player.java and changing the maximum run percentage from 100, to 2147M but obviously, that gave an error.

If anyone knows how, I would appreciate a small bit of help.

Thanks.</description>
