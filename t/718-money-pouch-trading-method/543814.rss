    <title>[718]Money Pouch Trading Method</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-money-pouch-trading-method/543814</link>
    <description>hello,

i am playing around with the rune-evo v3 source for something to do in my spare time and i m struggling to find a fi for the money pouch. the money pouch works near perfectly apart from when you are trading you cannot click &quot;+ money pouch&quot;, it does nothing meaning you have to have the money in your inventory. just woundering if there is a fix for this anyway. ive tried google for the past few houres but havnt found a fix for this.

thanks</description>

<p>Open an interface which allows the input of numbers, like the “x” feature when banking etc, make the result add in money from the money pouch by looking at how the money pouch is used, e.g:<br>
p.moneyPouch<br>
Then make a check to see if the player has entered an amount higher than what he actually has, so something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(enteredamount &gt;= p.moneyPouch)
       enteredamount = p.moneyPouch;</code></pre>
