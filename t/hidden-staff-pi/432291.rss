    <description>I had been looking through the snippets in the snippet section and was wondering what this actually did, with the hidden characters?

[quote=&quot;zyle1992, post:596, topic:256172&quot;]In this post, I&#39;ll be showing you how to add &quot;hidden&quot; characters. The purpose is to allow admins and mods to investigate certain players for rule breaking (without them noticing).

The process is really quite simple.

[ul][li]Add a &quot;hidden&quot; variable to the Player[/li]
[li]Check if the player is hidden in the update packet. If they are, ignore/remove them[/li]
[li]Add a command for mods/admins to make themselves hidden[/li][/ul]


[b][size=18pt]1. Adding the variable[/size][/b]
This part is easy. Go into your Player class, and add the following.
[code=Java]
private boolean hidden;
[/code]

And because we all want to follow simple object-oriented techniques, we&#39;re going to add a getter/setter pair.
[code=Java]
public boolean isHidden() {
    return hidden;
}

public void setHidden(final boolean hidden) {
    this.hidden = hidden;
}
[/code]

[b][size=18pt]2. Modifying the update process[/size][/b]
This part is a little bit more difficult. I&#39;m not going to get into specifics (PI vs Delta vs Czar, etc) because the process is the same regardless; the only things that change are the names.

Go into your update process, and add the following code where the other players are added to the current update list.
[code=Java]
if (otherPlayer.isHidden()) {
    if (currentPlayer.getPlayerList().contains(otherPlayer)) {
        currentPlayer.getPlayerList().remove(otherPlayer);
    }
    continue;
}
[/code]

as well as where the movement updates for the other players is added.

[b][size=18pt]3. Adding the command[/size][/b]
At this point, you should all know how to add commands to your servers. This command is very simple.
[code=Java]
if (command.equals(&quot;hidden&quot;)) {// NOTE: feel free to add whatever requirements you&#39;d like.
    final boolean hidden = Boolean.parseBoolean(args[0]);// Where args is the array of strings after the command name.
    player.setHidden(hidden);
}
[/code]

That&#39;s it. Now whenever a player uses the hidden command, it will be marked as hidden, and will disappear to all players that can currently see it, and not show up to future players.

@Atomic: Well for one thing, you&#39;re checking to see if the name.toLowerCase() equals one of the strings in the unspawnable list; however, your list contains strings that aren&#39;t exclusively lowercase.
[code=Java]
  &quot;Ahrim&quot;, &quot;Dharok&quot;, &quot;Guthan&quot;, &quot;Karil&quot;, &quot;Torag&quot;, &quot;Verac&quot;,
[/code]

You&#39;re also declaring the strings twice, one for the &quot;proper&quot;, and one for lowercase, taking up twice the amount of memory.

Second, Strings inherently take up more memory than ints. Ultimately, it&#39;s up to the VM to determine how much memory classes take up (if I recall), but it&#39;s usually 8 bytes + the sum of all primitive data types contained in the class, + the sum of all non-primitive, non-null datatypes. So for example, let&#39;s say we had the following class:

[code=Java]
public class Node {
    private long id;
    private Node next;
    private Node previous.

    // methods, constructor, etc
}
[/code]

The Node class has 8 bytes initially (object index, and name) + 8 bytes for the long, and if next and previous aren&#39;t null, 16+ bytes until a null is reached.[/quote]

Does it just make their crown hidden, etc, or does it make them invisible, and so on.

If it just hides the crown, is there a way to actually take a player off the minimap, make them invisible, but keep them there, and their text still able to be read?

Thanks.</description>
