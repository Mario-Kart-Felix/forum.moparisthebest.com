    <description>I just need a little help.

I run the &quot;run&quot;.batch file of the DELTA scape source 

and then i load up the Moparscape client... Used the default IP.

It loads and connects to server. So everything is good soo far. The DELTA server is running and the mopar client is working.

But when i click LOGIN using a random user and PW it says it cant find my Character Profile.


How do i make my Character profile so that i can log in. i didnt think i would have to.. thought it would all be automatic...

Thanks.</description>
