        <p>Last night I had an extremely vivid dream to what I thought was actually reality, I can remember it like it actually happened. If it were not that I woke up in my own bed I would have known no difference.</p>
<p>I could actually touch and feel things and control what I do, I was also extremely scared. It would almost loop back on itself, I would sit in a room with people who would then say something, I would then just standup and start to fall, once falling I hit the floor and hurt myself (I actually felt pain), I pinched myself to see if I was dreaming and I was able to pinch myself, and feel what I thought was a pinch. This did not wake me up and this is when I started to become scared, I was put into a maze whereby there were security guards looking after some object, It almost looked like it was the key to the universe or something similar. I do not know why but there was the key and a door, however attatched to the key was a label with a picture of a hand and a cross over it. I refused to pick it up and continued to explore this maze, I was always able to return back to the key by following my footsteps backwards as there was a slight dust on the floor. The maze was also cold. After exploring for what felt like half an hour I stumbled upon a door, to which was open. I open the door and walk through to find myself in the original room i was in with the people, I was very confused and I sat back down in the same seat. The people were still having the same convosation and then I realised it was exactly the same convosation they were having and when it got to the point where I fell last time I jumped up and said “No De Ja Vu, I have seen this before” and at that point again begun to fall. This happened 3 more times, however each time I got faster at the maze because I learnt the way, after it happened for a 5th time I fell and a piece of paper fell with me, and I managed to give myself a paper cut and was in alot of pain at this point, as well as my legs and ribs hurting from constantly falling. I thought I was either going mad or dying. This time I decided to ignore the warning on the key and proceeded to open the door, however soon as I picked up the key the whole maze collapsed and the security guards came over to me with syringes and saws, I was pleeding for my life saying “no, no, no help, I don’t know why I am here” they proceeded to inject me with lots of things. I then tryed to kick away, at this point I woke up in my bed. I checked to see if i had a paper cut, hurt ribs or syringe marks. None of these things were visible apart from a healed paper cut wound, I did wake up crying and in a bed of sweat.</p>
<p>what could this mean? I have two theories, one being I was abducted and actually put through this, two being that I was just dreaming. But that doesnt explain the paper cut wound still being there, I have never had a cut there before and didnt before I went to bed, it isnt even a small cut which could be passed off as a slight accident in bed. It is also very worrying that it felt so real, I could feel pain and I could still think rationally, I just did not understand what was going on. I could write so much more about what happened in extreme detail, probably more so than I could write if I got on a bus to town and had to explain it.</p>
<p>tl;dr - I had a VERY realistic nightmare.</p>

        <p>You had a paper cut, you didn’t consciously acknowledge it but the subconscious parts of your brain did. It then brought up the paper cut in the dream.</p>
<p>Interesting dream though.</p>

I googled seven nurses today to see if it meant something. It didn’t.</p>

        <p>i had a really fucked up dream the other day, but it wasn’t exactly a dream…</p>
<p>i past out on my couch, and slightly woke up (still feeling the REM of my eyes). the door to my kitchen in front of me opened slightly and i started hearing noises coming from the basement, and then i felt my foot starting to get dragged off the couch… i started tripping balls but still laid still, and then decided it was too fucked up and fully opened my eyes as if nothing happened</p>

I’ve also had dreams where I’ve told myself in the dream that I am only dreaming, then continued on with the dream being aware of it not being real.</p>

        <p>Been there done that Ollie, and not on drugs…infact I’ve been having dreams like that from long before I started doing drugs or drinking.</p>
<p>It isn’t exactly lucid, because even though you have semi-control over yourself, you still have to follow the boundaries your mind has set for this dream and can not alter the “rules” so to speak.  It is a game, and you lost.  Just as I have many times before.  It is sometimes impossible to win, other times very difficult depending on the circumstances of your dream.</p>
<p>I would wake up with scratches…cuts…even a bruise once.  Each one I would be able to relate directly to the same place it happened in my dream.  I even started keeping a journal about these “dream games”.  They are very scary indeed.</p>
<p>I seen a sleep specialist when I was 15 for a sleep apnea test.  Sure enough, I had a dream that very evening.  The specialist woke me up before I could get far into it, and told me I was self-inflicting wounds on myself.  Three deep scratches on my chest where in my dream a bear had attacked me.</p>
<p>The way he explained it, is once you hit a certain stage of sleep your body’s nervous system becomes so shutdown (so to speak) that you can’t even feel yourself inflicting damage to your body.  However, when you do, the nerves still send the electric impulses to your brain saying where the pain is coming from.  Your dream then adjusts to this and creates a circumstance where this injury is inflicted.</p>
<p>I’m very interested and can relate completely to this subject so if you would like to ask any more questions about it I’d be happy to answer.  I’ve been there…first time is the hardest :P…but they aren’t that common and not many people can have them.</p>

        <p>My first wet dream was to lucid dreaming. Dreampt I could go around raping any woman I wanted. Came across some mid thirties woman, felt so awesome and woke up with pants full of jizzum. That was like 3 years ago.</p>
<p>Few days ago I had a proper nice lucid dream, had lots of sex. It feels so amazing knowing your asleep and knowing you can do whatever you want, it’s like a gift from god… not even going to describe the people I had sex with, was fucked up.</p>

        <p>For more proof you and I aren’t the only ones, here is another testament:</p>
<blockquote>My boyfriend also does the same, its getting worse, he rang me this am nearly in tears because he has now ripped about 5 fifty cent sized holes in his lower stomach. its out of controll, &amp; we have no way to prevent it or fix it. Along with his increasingly worsening sleep apnea(its in his brain, not his throat we found out last year wile he was on life support after a head injury) Crazy very life like dreams Please someone would have to no who to talk to?? Is he mental???</blockquote>Source: http://ehealthforum.com/health/self-injury-while-sleeping-t165484.html
<p>Obviously this is a rather extreme case, but it can get very very ugly sometimes.  Before you know it, it is possible (almost happened to me once) that you won’t be waking up in a bed of sweat next time…it may be a bed of blood.</p>
<p>If you continue to have these dreams, you need to see a doctor who will refer you to a sleep specialist.  They can provide you with meds to help, and they will help, unless your drug-like self decides to start snorting them to get high.  If you choose to help yourself, wear big winter gloves to bed and try to make sure they don’t have that plastic grip stuff on them or any sharp things attached.  Also wear socks.</p>
<p>The dream itself will become more violent and more gruesome as the level of self-inflicted wounding increases.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Also, the syringes are probably the result of the “pins and needles” feeling you get when your body first starts to wake up, which would explain why it happens near the end of your dream.</p>
