    <title>EXTREMELY vivid dream</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/extremely-vivid-dream/344726</link>
    <description>Last night I had an extremely vivid dream to what I thought was actually reality, I can remember it like it actually happened. If it were not that I woke up in my own bed I would have known no difference.

I could actually touch and feel things and control what I do, I was also extremely scared. It would almost loop back on itself, I would sit in a room with people who would then say something, I would then just standup and start to fall, once falling I hit the floor and hurt myself (I actually felt pain), I pinched myself to see if I was dreaming and I was able to pinch myself, and feel what I thought was a pinch. This did not wake me up and this is when I started to become scared, I was put into a maze whereby there were security guards looking after some object, It almost looked like it was the key to the universe or something similar. I do not know why but there was the key and a door, however attatched to the key was a label with a picture of a hand and a cross over it. I refused to pick it up and continued to explore this maze, I was always able to return back to the key by following my footsteps backwards as there was a slight dust on the floor. The maze was also cold. After exploring for what felt like half an hour I stumbled upon a door, to which was open. I open the door and walk through to find myself in the original room i was in with the people, I was very confused and I sat back down in the same seat. The people were still having the same convosation and then I realised it was exactly the same convosation they were having and when it got to the point where I fell last time I jumped up and said &quot;No De Ja Vu, I have seen this before&quot; and at that point again begun to fall. This happened 3 more times, however each time I got faster at the maze because I learnt the way, after it happened for a 5th time I fell and a piece of paper fell with me, and I managed to give myself a paper cut and was in alot of pain at this point, as well as my legs and ribs hurting from constantly falling. I thought I was either going mad or dying. This time I decided to ignore the warning on the key and proceeded to open the door, however soon as I picked up the key the whole maze collapsed and the security guards came over to me with syringes and saws, I was pleeding for my life saying &quot;no, no, no help, I don&#39;t know why I am here&quot; they proceeded to inject me with lots of things. I then tryed to kick away, at this point I woke up in my bed. I checked to see if i had a paper cut, hurt ribs or syringe marks. None of these things were visible apart from a healed paper cut wound, I did wake up crying and in a bed of sweat.

what could this mean? I have two theories, one being I was abducted and actually put through this, two being that I was just dreaming. But that doesnt explain the paper cut wound still being there, I have never had a cut there before and didnt before I went to bed, it isnt even a small cut which could be passed off as a slight accident in bed. It is also very worrying that it felt so real, I could feel pain and I could still think rationally, I just did not understand what was going on. I could write so much more about what happened in extreme detail, probably more so than I could write if I got on a bus to town and had to explain it.

tl;dr - I had a VERY realistic nightmare.</description>

it does that whether the program is running or not… its just more noticable when the temperature is lower, which is what the program does; lower the display ‘temperature’</p>

<p>There is some time between shutting down and going to bed. For example, this week I step away from my laptop at around 9 pm, and go to bed around 11 pm. I do watch TV in between. I’ll try the program nonetheless, sometimes I notice that it’s already dark, and that I’ve been staring at a bright screen.</p>

<p>the ubermann sleep schedule is quite similar in idea too, i dunno why it works that way tho</p>

It’s also mostly subconcious stuff, not stuff you’re purposely thinking about before you go to sleep. Apparently the evolutionary reason for it is so we can experience new situations and make decisions without actually being in any danger.</p>

<p>seriously? i find that hard to believe. i cant recall a night where i didnt dream, and i understand not all dreaming is during rem, but most of my dreams are pretty vivid and etc. are you refering to people who sleep too little or is this true for people who sleep 8 hours a night too?[/quote]On average, and I can cite the medical book I read it from when I find it, only 1/3 of people reach REM sleep every night in a week, even when getting 8 hours of sleep.  Your body begins to dream at the stage <span class="bbcode-i">before</span> REM.</p>
<p>It is the leading cause of mistaken sleep apnea.</p>
