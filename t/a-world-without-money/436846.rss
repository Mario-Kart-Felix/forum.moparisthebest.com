<h3><a href="https://www.thevenusproject.com/resource-based-economy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Resource Based Economy | The Venus Project</a></h3>

<p>In a Resource Based Economy all goods and services are available to all people without the need for money, credits, barter or any other means.</p>


  </article>
  <div class="onebox-metadata">
    
    
  </div>
  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>
</p>
<p>Essentially (some paragraphs were omitted).</p>
<blockquote>The term and meaning of a Resource Based Economy was originated by Jacque Fresco. It is a holisticsocio-economic system in which all goods and services are available without the use of money, credits, barter or any other system of debt or servitude. All resources become the common heritage of all of the inhabitants, not just a select few. The premise upon which this system is based is that the Earth is abundant with plentiful resource; our practice of rationing resources through monetary methods is irrelevant and counter productive to our survival.
<p>Modern society has access to highly advanced technology and can make available food, clothing, housing and medical care; update our educational system; and develop a limitless supply of renewable, non-contaminating energy. By supplying an efficiently designed economy, everyone can enjoy a very high standard of living with all of the amenities of a high technological society.</p>
<p>A resource-based economy would utilize existing resources from the land and sea, physical equipment, industrial plants, etc. to enhance the lives of the total population. In an economy based on resources rather than money, we could easily produce all of the necessities of life and provide a high standard of living for all.</p>
<p>In a resource-based economy all of the world’s resources are held as the common heritage of all of Earth’s people, thus eventually outgrowing the need for the artificial boundaries that separate people. This is the unifying imperative.</p>
<p>A resource-based economy would make it possible to use technology to overcome scarce resources by applying renewable sources of energy, computerizing and automating manufacturing and inventory, designing safe energy-efficient cities and advanced transportation systems, providing universal health care and more relevant education, and most of all by generating a new incentive system based on human and environmental concern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hate the concept. I am a cynic but this just reminds me too much of damn Wall-E.</p>

<p>Currency was made in roman times I believe(not the earliest form I know but i remember hearing that when I was like 5), it wouldn’t be chaos as people traded with items rather than irl gps back then <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>While I didn’t watch it, I feel this would bring the bartering system back into play for countries and give the third world countries an upper hand to be able to take advantage not only of the abundance of resources many of them possess (gold, oil, natural gas, etc) but to be able to use this to get things that are currently in cheap abundance in first world countries (food, comfort, etc.). This could speed up development in a number of these countries, but also leave 4th world countries (those without any natural resource) practically no chance to get back into the world market.</p>

<p>ya that stops me too. but like the guy in the video said(not in these exact words) is the stuff we believe true or just what we have been made to believe? does our young become greedy b/c its human nature and the ones who aren’t greedy learn not to be, or have they just been fed/taught while growing up? will there be greed if the idea of greed has been phased out of society, through planning and advances in technology? to form a more perfect society there would have to be some drastic changes that im sure a majority of the population would be against unless you were able to speak their language. but then i think how would ppl like current generations live in a future society where the future generations learn better morals than those that go on today. would we corrupt them or would we eventually be assimilated into that way of life. idk it takes a lot of deep thought about thinking about different mindsets and ways of thinking, and society setup so different from the way you were born and raised.</p>

<p>The enviroment makes us what we are, and also how we were raised, but sadly, it would be extremely hard to change things now, considering there are billions of people that live by this current system, including the greedy ones, if we just suddenly change the system, they will still be greedy and do what they are doing now. If we wanted to really change the system so there would be no such things as money, we would need to ‘restart’ or just slowly move towards it…But then again, humans have always had somekind of currency, whether it was some kind of material or coins, it would just be so strange.</p>
<p>If we had no currency of anykind, we could just take what we need, if you wanted a car you could take it, we would also need to share things we have and we don’t need, with greedy people around it’s impossible. I just don’t see how it would work, maybe I’m irrogant…I don’t know.</p>
