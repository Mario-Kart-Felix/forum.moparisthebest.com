    <title>Adding objects from cache?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-objects-from-cache/525866</link>
    <description>Okay so i understand that objects like 1415,1602, 1826 etc. are all wall objects, but in object list that are on the forums these objects are nulled objects that we cannot custom spawn through server because they are client sided objects within the cache i believe. the reason i chose these objects as an example is because i was using peters map editor and in the spots where walls would be those object numbers appear. So my question is how do i spawn these objects that are in the cache that i cannot spawn server sided. if anyone can give information to why this even not possible that would be great to, i just wanna learn more about this and use it to my advantage, just a learning experience :D.</description>
