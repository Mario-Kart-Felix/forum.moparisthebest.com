    <title>How to add people to the FTB whitelist, and not break my script</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-people-to-the-ftb-whitelist-and-not-break-my-script/517603</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve took the time to write another script, this one basically checks the forum topic every 24h, reads the list in the format I posted and then pushes it to the white-list.txt topic on the server. The topic [b]must[/b] remain locked so only staff can edit it, if anyone opens it normal members can edit the whitelist. When the server goes down for the restart and backup the whitelist will be updated too. Here is how you add someone:

Step 1) Navigate to https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,638656.0.html

Step 2) Take note of the format, click edit, and say we want to add a person called &quot;Chris&quot; we do:

[code][x]-Chris[/code]

and then hit save. it MUST be in this format, or it will not work. The script isnt interested in anything on the page, but that format. You can also remove people from the whitelist by removing the &quot;[ x]-name&quot;. As stated at the start, the effect wont be instant, it will update every night when the server goes down.</description>

              <p>Really annoying setting plugins up with FTB, and we dont currently have a fully working permission set that’s configured so it’d require us giving all staff operator ingame. Besides, I wanted to try something more cool. It allows for uptodate representation of the list, and in the future I want to link it into everything including staff and bans, but that will come with more security and not just a locked topic that all staff can edit. We’ve always had trouble with keeping the forum uptodate with the server, so now this makes them go hand in hand.</p>

              <p>Just out of curiosity why did you decide to write your own script for the whitelist and not use the scripts that already exists through the use of in-game commands?</p>
