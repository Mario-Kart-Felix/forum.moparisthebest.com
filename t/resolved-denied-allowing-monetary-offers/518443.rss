    <title>[RESOLVED - DENIED] Allowing Monetary Offers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-denied-allowing-monetary-offers/518443</link>
    <description>This might come across as a rather selfish proposal, but I&#39;m suggesting removing the rule that doesn&#39;t allow buying/selling things - at least to some extent.

First off, if a user gets scammed, it&#39;s usually his or her fault for not being careful enough. And plus all the rule is doing is preventing people from making offers. Sites like rune-server have people buying/selling RSPS work all the time (and I&#39;d like to remind you just how much of a better private server site r-s is).

So what will this do and why am I suggesting it? Well, I believe some good things can come out of it. For example (and here comes the selfishness), if someone offered me $30 and asked me to make a map editor, I would do it. The community would get it, and now there would be a decent map editor available and we could start seeing custom maps. &quot;Wow Lin, why not just make it and release it to the community anyway? We don&#39;t want that kind of greediness in our community.&quot; Actually, it&#39;s great motivation. [b]Right now improving the community isn&#39;t good enough motivation and the boost a monetary reward offers is gigantic.[/b]

              <p>A lot of work goes into supporting monetary transactions, even when scamming is removed.</p>
<p>For example, consider we emulated websites like freelancer and provided a pay-for-programming service which involved escrow of funds. User A says they’ll pay $50, and the funding is held by Moparisthebest in an escrow account. User B completes the work, but User A is unsatisfied (maybe the work isn’t up to scratch, or maybe they’re trying to get out of paying).<br>
Who is supposed to arbitrate this kind of thing?</p>

              <p>I just like the idea of moparisthebest paying some money for open source programs, it’s unreasonable to expect too much from him but for useful programs it could be an investment. If anyone has any ideas of what programs would really benefit the community, they should post them. Perhaps we could come up with a wishlist of downloads for our site, that programmers will see.</p>
<p>I mean stuff beyond just a good rsps base, lin mentioned a map editor but there must be other useful programs to be made?</p>
<p>Almost sad that we’d have to pay but there is nothing happening otherwise. I think even people in <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> would be tempted if they had a whole list of different things that could be made and a listed price/requirements.</p>
<p>If the moparscpae homepage had a downloads tab and all our own great open source tools/programs with clear descriptions and some images, people would definitely check it out, and they would want to try them out.</p>

Would that cover what you are talking about?[/quote]I mentioned that; you’ve had that <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,345848.0.html" data-bbcode="true">offer</a> up for a long time, and I think there was a reply in there where you said you would consider buying tools/utilities as well. If that’s the idea, then maybe it just needs more visibility or a slight rework (in a way that people can suggest things we need, we have a list of them, and then people can submit and if it’s up to par they get paid)</p>

              <p>The problem with this IS the scamming, and it absolutely will happen, it has and does at every other site I’ve been a member of or ever even heard of that allowed members to buy or sell anything.  Someone said just record proof, but that is hard to do too, and easy to fake.  Then the staff is stuck in the position of trying to determine who is the scammer and who got scammed, and link the scammer to a forum account, which you then ban just for them to come back under another name.  Sometimes sites try to fix this problem by offering certified ‘middle men’, who handle the transaction by taking payment and product from both sides, and only delivering the goods when both have lived up to the agreement.  This works fine as long as that guy is trustworthy, but most of the time they are only trustworthy for a limited amount of time, when they scam everyone for multiple transactions all at once then ‘quit’ the community, generally coming back later under another name to do it again.</p>
<p>That being said, you mentioned something about someone paying you for a product and then the community benefiting, if it was a private transaction, there would be no community benefit.  However, if you wanted to release the product freely and open source, I could probably pay you out of the sponsored server fund, or maybe we could set up such a system to handle something like that, the community pooling money for programs.  Would that cover what you are talking about?</p>

The problem with money in communities is that it separates those who have money and can pay for things, and those who don’t and can’t. Adding a section where people can go to buy and sell will just cause problems between the legit programmers who want to make a good server, and the fake ones who have their parents in their pocket, and want to buy a pre-made server to leech. It is easier to keep things the way they are, it isn’t broken and it shouldn’t be fixed. However, you should be allowed to do underground transactions between one and another member with no relation to the community. You cannot stop people from selling or buying things they really want, but you can keep it from causing community dysfunction.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Based on the OP, I don’t see why it would separate the community between those who have money and those who don’t. The $30 would simply be motivation for him to create it and release it to the entire community, not just the buyer individually.</p>
<p>[quote author=Lin link=topic=636708.msg4292589#msg4292589 date=1367602758]<br>

Because despite these intentions to release it after someone has paid you, the person paying you may not want you to release it. If you do, it will cause tension between members. Who pays someone for something they can’t have to themselves, the community wouldn’t be paying for it so why would they have it? There are too many problems that will occur if this takes place, and every one  has different intentions. You can assume it will help the community, but that chances are it will only make members selfish.</p>

It effects the RSPS community which is a large part of our community. They’re gonna advertise their server here and there but right now they only buy stuff over there ;)[/quote]<br>
