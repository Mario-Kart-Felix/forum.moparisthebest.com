So you’re saying they have a bigger community because they have a marketplace? So I could link you to some other RS site that doesn’t have a marketplace and is much bigger and use that as logic that we shouldn’t have one?<br>
[/quote]<br>
That’s not the sole reason they are bigger. Don’t try and twist my words. It is, however, something they have and we do not and they are a bigger community. You can take whatever you want from that but I don’t think you could show me a RSPS site bigger than them or ever MoparScape that doesn’t have a marketplace.[/quote]All I’m saying is you can’t look at a site that is bigger and look at a feature and say it’s a reason they are bigger. I could do exactly the same thing for R-S and say we should let people pay money to get unbanned or have paid user ranks. Do you see my point? Just because a site is bigger and has a certain feature doesn’t mean that feature is good</p>
<p>The main thing I have against this is that it’s like craigslist, all trust based. We’re not a store forum, we don’t have ways to guarentee product or guarentee payment. It’s kinda trashy to do it.</p>

<p>this community began, revolving around bots and rsps themselves. now we have web, graphics, and other programming boards.</p>
<p>i’ll agree that the majority of the userbase on any given rsps site is mostly teenagers, but who’s to say there arent people who actually want to do certain things like graphic design, web design, or application development for a living?</p>
<p>why can they not use this as a sort of temporary/whenever offerable job.</p>
<p>however, payments for help/servers (if not fully open source) should not be allowed.</p>

<p>payment (if allowed) should be shown as gratitude for something you’ve done or payment to a service. it should not be asked. we dont need a market place where users can sell things they havent made.</p>

Wont work on this community. The majority of users are not 16, let alone 18, and as such can not even legally have ways to pay users. This leads to fraud, scamming, using parents credit cards, etc. I doubt Moparisthebest wants to be seen as the catalyst in those type of transactions.

<p>Surely if I ask my parents to pay on my behalf, that doesn’t make it illegal? Also, I could pay over the internet with my debit card when I was 15. And I think Lin meant that the motivation of having $30 to merely create it in the first place was enough.[/quote]No, that’s not illegal. But I know there are teens that steal from their parents to buy things online. And that’s pretty much exactly like the private server fund. The difference is Moparisthebest would pay for sure, and they showed him the product before he paid. And he did offer to buy other things as well, and the offer is still there, but nobody is doing it. Or did people forget about that <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>So you’re saying they have a bigger community because they have a marketplace? So I could link you to some other RS site that doesn’t have a marketplace and is much bigger and use that as logic that we shouldn’t have one?</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s not the sole reason they are bigger. Don’t try and twist my words. It is, however, something they have and we do not and they are a bigger community. You can take whatever you want from that but I don’t think you could show me a RSPS site bigger than them or ever MoparScape that doesn’t have a marketplace.<br>
[/quote]All I’m saying is you can’t look at a site that is bigger and look at a feature and say it’s a reason they are bigger. I could do exactly the same thing for R-S and say we should let people pay money to get unbanned or have paid user ranks. Do you see my point? Just because a site is bigger and has a certain feature doesn’t mean that feature is good</p>
<p>The main thing I have against this is that it’s like craigslist, all trust based. We’re not a store forum, we don’t have ways to guarentee product or guarentee payment. It’s kinda trashy to do it.</p>

</aside>
<p>But we’re trying to grow the forums so why not try to include a marketplace so people have another reason to come to MoparScape?[/quote]And why not add a NSFW section… that’d bring in a lot of activity <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Instead of struggling to try and appeal to other communities userbases, we should do what WE do best, but even better. Step 1 would be to create a homepage portal like it’s been suggested in the announcements topic, to make these sites easier to navigate and easier on the eyes.</p>

        <p>The problem with money in communities is that it separates those who have money and can pay for things, and those who don’t and can’t.

<p>The problem with money in communities is that it separates those who have money and can pay for things, and those who don’t and can’t. Adding a section where people can go to buy and sell will just cause problems between the legit programmers who want to make a good server, and the fake ones who have their parents in their pocket, and want to buy a pre-made server to leech. It is easier to keep things the way they are, it isn’t broken and it shouldn’t be fixed. However, you should be allowed to do underground transactions between one and another member with no relation to the community. You cannot stop people from selling or buying things they really want, but you can keep it from causing community dysfunction.</p>

<p>Based on the OP, I don’t see why it would separate the community between those who have money and those who don’t. The $30 would simply be motivation for him to create it and release it to the entire community, not just the buyer individually.</p>

        <p>I don’t like the thought of being payed to create. I am on XDA-Developers alot and here is a couple prices of their system that could work.<br>
°A user contributed bounty for a program, as in whoever comes up with it gets our money, a finished polished product.<br>
°We have a donate button linking to the users PayPal and are not slowed to request payment. This way XDA is not involved.<br>
°We can use adf.ly links as long as there is another non-monetary link that the adf.ly leads to. Another way for users to donate.<br>
----Just last month I payed my truck and cell phone bill thanks to adf.ly</p>

Because despite these intentions to release it after someone has paid you, the person paying you may not want you to release it. If you do, it will cause tension between members. Who pays someone for something they can’t have to themselves, the community wouldn’t be paying for it so why would they have it? There are too many problems that will occur if this takes place, and every one  has different intentions. You can assume it will help the community, but that chances are it will only make members selfish.</p>
