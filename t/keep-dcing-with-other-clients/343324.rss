    <description>Hey,

I have been using a base to work of for a long time now, and im now comming up to finishing my server and want to move on and imporve the client or even change client, but everytime i log in with another client i get dced. I think it may be because the client is calling something in the server files, and if the client doesnt have it, it cant log in.

Please help
