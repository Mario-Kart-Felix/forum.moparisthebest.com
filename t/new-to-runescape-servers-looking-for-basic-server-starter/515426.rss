    <title>New to Runescape servers; looking for basic server starter</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-to-runescape-servers-looking-for-basic-server-starter/515426</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been lurking and going through threads and trying different downloads for about a week now, and I haven&#39;t found what I&#39;m looking for.

I&#39;m basically looking for a vanilla RS2007 server set-up, except I&#39;m not even really interested in hosting a public server. It&#39;s just something I want to set up for myself and my roommates, just so we can play a game we used to enjoy when we were younger. Modern-day Runescape is completely foreign to me at this point and I&#39;d rather not pay the Members&#39; fee to play their so-called &quot;Old School&quot; game. Unfortunately, most of the tutorials seem to focus on public server hosting when I&#39;d like to get it running locally before tinkering with anything else.

In looking through the forums here, I&#39;ve found a lot of information on java development, which is handy, but I&#39;m already a decent java programmer and I&#39;m not planning on doing any incredibly complicated mods anyway. I&#39;ve tried downloading a ton of the servers that are already on the forum, but I&#39;ve either run into various errors (mind you, I&#39;m not a stranger to java and I got past a lot of the simple java-compatibility ones) or have encountered dead links.

Apologies if this isn&#39;t in the right forum. It&#39;s a little difficult to figure out what&#39;s what, as an outsider to this community, and I&#39;m just looking for somewhere to start.</description>

              <p>Thanks, both of you! I’ll start working with those and see if I can make some headway.</p>
<p>As an aside, a lot of the downloads I’ve looked through specifically note which quests are included; am I to assume that every quest has to be written from scratch or something? I figured they’d usually be included with wherever the source originally came from.</p>
