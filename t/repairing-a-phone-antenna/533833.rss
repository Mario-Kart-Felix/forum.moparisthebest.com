    <title>Repairing a phone antenna?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/repairing-a-phone-antenna/533833</link>
    <description>I have a Huawei Piller (M615). It&#39;s a cricket phone. I have $0 to buy anything. The other night I got in a fight, and threw my phone down a street.  Now, it&#39;s broken in multiple places (the plastic shell). It works just as it did before, with an exception. The phone cannot find any cell signal. I don&#39;t exactly know why, but I assume it&#39;s the antenna. No, it&#39;s not some retro phone that has an antenna that you&#39;d pull out the side of it or anything like that. It has one of those integrated ones. So I need to figure out how to attempt a repair on this, mostly because I&#39;m expecting a call from a potential employer sometime this week. Yeah, go figure I break it when I need it most..
Here&#39;s what it looks like (ignore the black case):

<p>That still takes money to activate, I pay for monthly service, and actually just had the bill paid and it expires in November, so I’d rather not pay for another phone line.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’d depend on what repairs are needed. Like I said, I have no money at this time, but getting this repaired is a priority…<br>
I can’t exactly say what is wrong, as there’s no clear way to tell.<br>
Edit: anything over like $50 would be useless as I could just buy a used one of these for like 20-30 bucks and get it reactivated for about 15.</p>
