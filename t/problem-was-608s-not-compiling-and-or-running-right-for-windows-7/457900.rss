    <title>Problem was : 608s+ not compiling and or running right. for windows 7</title>

    <description>Solution is update your jdk and jre, even if you think it is up to date. my version is jre7 and jdk1.7.0_03

jdk version is located in program files and jre version is located in program files (x86) this is ONLY way i could get it to work

make sure your jdk is located in program files not program files (x86)</description>
