    <title>[tut] Creating a login system with php and MySQL</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-creating-a-login-system-with-php-and-mysql/9253</link>
    <description>Well, I was browsing this and saw a few threads asking for help in this area and I have written a tutorial on it, so I figured I&#39;d put this out there. It describes how to create a complete login system, including the register page, the login page, handling users, etc. Well, since this was too long, I&#39;m hosting it somehwere else and just putting links to it here. I don&#39;t think this would be considered advertising since it links to a forum I hosted for my friends and no one ever goes there anymore. But if I&#39;m wrong, just tell me. HEre is the table of contents:

[url=http://www.ezforum.org/dirtymustard/dirtymustard-post-239.html#239]Chapter 1: Starting Out[/url]

EDIT: Ok, seriously, something does not want me to post this. Ezforum won&#39;t let me make new topics on my own freaking forum. Please don&#39;t think I&#39;m an idiot while I look for a different host :-[</description>
