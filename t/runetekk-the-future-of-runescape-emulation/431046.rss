    <description>[size=12pt][U]RuneTekk::Preamble[/U]

Welcome to the RuneTekk development team thread. RuneTekk is a recreation of the previously acclaimed Evelus project which brought new and exciting emulation tools and ideas to the industry. I&#39;m pleased to announce that RuneTekk emulation tools and development will continue in stride with what Evelus was once set on to do. If you are unaware of what Evelus was, we were a group of Runescape emulators who sought to help the community and make it easier for you, the customer, to develop Runescape emulation. We will be continuing on that same goal and as we move forward we hope to involve the Moparscape community with threads detailing the current Runescape protocols, updating the wiki also with the newer Runescape protocols and manufacturing tools in which you can all use. We hope to see your support and we also look forward to any comments or ideas you post. Thank you, have a nice day.

[U]RuneTekk::Projects[/U]

The Cloud -&gt; [URL=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,533054.0.html]Project Thread[/url]

The Cloud is a utility that will detect and download any updated file of the Runescape cache from the Jagex server and document the update history of the entire Runescape cache. All files will be downloadable by revision or by the specific  file along with  any information of when the file had been changed. The current code is open source and can be found on the project thread. 

XTEA Server -&gt; [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,529995.0.html]Project Thread[/url]

The XTEA server once allowed for members to upload their files and verify if they were correct keys to decipher the Runescape landscape archives. Because of recent complications we no longer have the site for this and will have to remake it. However we still do have the server and when we create a new website page for this we will update this description with more information.

[U]RuneTekk::The Application[/U]
As you most likely assumed, this is a development team thread, and we need developers, HOWEVER, the programmer who will help must be skillful. However, here is an application.

[code]IRL Name: This can be said over PM or in here, just to get to know you
Years of Programming: However many years you have programmed. 
Programming Languages Known: Hopefully more than one, however if you are an expert in just one language we will overlook it.
Reason for Joining: Self-Explanatory
Skype/Msn: You may message Sinisoul or me this, however both is preferred (Both of us being messaged).
[/code]

[size=12pt]
Website Developer Application [/size]
[code]IRL Name: Again, just to get to know you. NOT NEEDED, just preferred.
Years in Web Development: Not just making a free forum, actually developing websites.
Languages Known: More than just Html is required.
Skype/Msn: Just give us the skype or the msn, or message us it.
Reason for Joining: Just tell us your reason. We don&#39;t care if its bored, money, whatever.
[/code]
[size=12pt]
Note: We are also in need of a good graphics artist. We won&#39;t make an app, but just show us your previous works, tell us a little about you, skype or msn, and finally years of making graphics.

Now the current people developing this project are:
Kieran Bailey (Baddy351, `Hash, Integer_)
Hadyn Fitzgerald (Sinisoul)

Thanks for reading.</description>
