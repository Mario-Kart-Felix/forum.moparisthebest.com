    <title>Would This be worth the effort?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-this-be-worth-the-effort/410150</link>
    <description>I wanted to rework a server to make it well, &quot;noob friendly&quot; make a class for all the skills, remove most of the stuff from client. java, as they only thing required in that is the non-shared variables, [loading, leaving, leveling,...] and the player.java can cover them O_o. client.java would be the PRIMARY routing point for packets received from the user. They then would be sent to where ever they are required =P stuff like itemOnObject, itemOnItem, itemOnItem[interface Handled version], itemOnPlayer[not needed ATM], atObject(click object), and atItem(click item) would be the new Primary &quot;workzones&quot; for coding. i am second guessing myself on making a file for every skill, but at least would organize the parts of those skills in the corresponding file.

if anyone has opinions i would like them &gt;.&gt; i know this sounds a lot like delta actually, which is ironic because i just looked at one of them XD.</description>

              <p>it wouldn’t be me deleting any classes, just moving data used in unison across the server to a separate file. example[i’d but a colon here but my colon key is broken XD, i have to code on my desktop O_o]</p>
<p>[SKILLS]<br>
each person has their own skills, therefore not in unison and unique to each person. stay in the client.java</p>
<p>[ACTIONS]<br>
using items on objects does the same thing for every person across the server.<br>
clicking rocks to mine, for example, is the same across the server.</p>
<p>[OBJECT HANDLING]<br>
this needs to be established still [by me] to make trees server sided [i had no idea how to word this correctly] so every client loads the same tree state.<br>
instead of them all being self done, trees and doors are the main examples of this.<br>
i suck at explaining things =[ this is why my rep is low, i suck at tutorials but i am good at coding ~_~</p>

              <p>I’m getting confused? your going to delete some classes and use others to replace the ones you’ve deleted, but all mostly in the same class? because if you’re going to do that, that would be horrid.</p>
