Hello fellow members of Moparscape, and welcome to my OFFICIAL advertisement thread for my project, Poltergeist.

At poltergeist, we are a very friendly community aiming to shoot for the top and add new content to satisfy our players every day.  We focus on what YOU as the community want in the server, and base that off of what is added. The project has not been around for long, only around a week but it&#39;s coming along very well and very fun to work with. The history on the project can be found in the spoiler below.

Poltergeist History
[spoiler]
Poltergeist originated when I decided to get into coding back in 2010. It wasn&#39;t always named poltergeist, it actually started out as &quot;Legend Of Godz Scape&quot;.  My learning experience on RSPS started with a delta source, and my experience and knowledge quickly expanded.
Legend Of Godz Scape was eventually closed down (after acquiring a playerbase of about 30 players daily) because I had been busy with school, and I discontinued the project to later bring back the server, but with a new name. The new name was &#39;New Redemption&#39;, and that server lasted from January of 2011 to October of 2011. I was hosting the server off of my computer, and had around 15-25 on daily, but had to discontinue it because my computer had shit out on me. I was unable to back up my files, so New Redemption was then history. 
After being extremely dissapointed in the loss of my files,  I had taken a break from RSPS until mid 2013, where I would eventually bring back my server, with a PI base rather than a delta base. This was my most successful run with a server (peaking at 60 online daily) as I had run it from mid 2013 until July of 2014. The server was entitled Fatality-Scape. Many of you may remember it, and I encourage you to join Poltergeist if you had played it in the past.
My biggest regret was shutting the server down for such a stupid reason - I didn&#39;t have much time to work with the project anymore because of the serious relationship I was involved in, which lasted from April of 2014 until June of 2015. A lot of former players recently have been asking me to bring back the server, so here I am. I decided 2 weeks ago to begin an RSPS project, and bring back the server that I had loved hosting and to hopefully bring it back permanently and top our original peak of 60 players. I&#39;m a decent experienced coder, and I hope that I can supply those of you from Rune-Server with a fun-thrilled action-packed addictive adventure at Poltergeist.
