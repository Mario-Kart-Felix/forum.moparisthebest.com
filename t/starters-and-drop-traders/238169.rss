    <description>Ok, I&#39;m currently working on a DELTA [yes delta] based server. I would like to add a starter into the server. However, I&#39;m aware that people will then drop trade the 5m or whatever to a main to make money. One of my friends came up with an idea that sounds pretty good, I&#39;m just completely stumped on getting started. His idea was the following: The characters start with a &quot;token&quot; thats only to be spent in a certain store and cannot be traded or dropped. 

Now, if anyone can get me pointed in the right direction I&#39;d greatly appreicate it. I may just not be seeing something when it comes to this idea, or it may be a huge pain to accomplish. If you&#39;ve got another idea please PM me with details. 

Thanks for reading, CC. 

Basically what I&#39;d like to accomplish is: Giving new members a starter but not letting them drop trade it or transfer it. Sure, you can ban them as you catch them, but you&#39;re not going to catch everyone that does it.</description>
