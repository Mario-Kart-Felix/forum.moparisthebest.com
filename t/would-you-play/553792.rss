    <title>Would you play?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-you-play/553792</link>
    <description>If there was an app for android and ios that was possibly exactly like rs with great story line etc and massive dungeons like skyrim but rs2 graphics and was just single player would you play it or possibly even buy it and if so what would be the most you would spend. Just want honest answers no rude bashing comments.</description>
