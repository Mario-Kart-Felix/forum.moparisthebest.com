    <title>Looking for someone with extreme PhotoShop Skills</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-someone-with-extreme-photoshop-skills/98530</link>
    <description>First off, mods, if this is the wrong section, just move it please  :D.

Well basically, I need someone who is [b]really[/b], and I mean REALLY good at photoshop because I need a logo for my website. What I want is a realistic black, blue, and grey dragon(no cartoons please) breathing red/yellow/orange fire out of their mouth with a Z eched into it. Not like the actuall letter Z on it, I mean in the fire.

PM me if your interested. Oh, and I will pay for this to be done but obviously I can&#39;t discuss it here  ;).</description>
