    <description>Gday,

Using Project Insanity, Client 1 = clled, 602 client
###### Client 1 = New Bank &amp;&amp; Client 2 = Old Bank
[img]http://C:\Users\Blaak\Desktop\Proj_Ins_Test_Edit - Instellingen\Problem Noting.png[/img]

We&#39;ll, When i have like alot of ores on my bank.. for e.g.
And I want to note them for &quot;dropping or selling&quot; my client freezes, and i need to start the client[1] again. 
Now I&#39;ve found out, that when i&#39;am on an other client[2], I can use note.

Just when i hit the &quot;Note&quot; button is freezes inmidiatly, even when i go over it when the mouse without clicking it.

Does this exist because of the client ?

Because there are more problems with this client, Like

I am invisible.. I can see duradel on client 2, and I cant see him on client 1,

Maybe some-one nice can help me fixing this problem, or just simply send me a link of a good client ;)

Tyvm,
