    <description>Hello, today I basically made the following:

[code]			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;vote&quot;) &amp;&amp; voted==true) {
			c.sendMessage(&quot;You have allready voted today.&quot;);
			}
			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;vote&quot;) &amp;&amp; voted==false) {
//WILL OPEN WEBSITE LATER
			c.sendMessage(&quot;You may now do ::claim for your reward!&quot;);
			voted = true;
			}
			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;claim&quot;) &amp;&amp; voted==false) {
			c.sendMessage(&quot;You have not voted.&quot;);
			}
			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;claim&quot;) &amp;&amp; voted==true) {
			if (!Connection.hasVoted(Server.playerHandler.players[c.playerId].connectedFrom)) {
			c.getItems().addItem(6199, 1);
			c.sendMessage(&quot;Thank you for voting Creation&quot;);
			c.sendMessage(&quot;You have received a Mystery Box.&quot;);
						c.VoteTimer = 86400; //24 hours
			Connection.addIpToVote(Server.playerHandler.players[c.playerId].connectedFrom);
			Connection.addIpToVoteList(Server.playerHandler.players[c.playerId].connectedFrom);
			} else {
			c.sendMessage(&quot;You have already voted today.&quot;);
			}[/code]
What this does for me is allows me to type ::reward in-game, after doing this if I have not voted, it will say I have not voted, then if I do ::vote, and then ::reward it will properly give the items to me and it sets a timer
[code]						c.VoteTimer = 86400; //24 hours[/code]
This timer is supposed to run for 86400 seconds, or 24 hours (which is how long I want it to be before they are able to vote again). 
[code]			if (VoteTimer==0)
			Connection.VoteRenewal(Server.playerHandler.players[playerId].connectedFrom);
			if(VoteTimer &gt; 0)
			VoteTimer --;[/code]
How I go about doing this is I use Connection class to have their ip in a .txt and then after 24 hours under process() in my client.java like shown above, is once the VoteTimer of 86400 reaches 0, it removes the ip from the list and when they next do ::vote and ::check they are able to sucessfully carry this out.

THE PROBLEM: If a player logs out, it resets the timer, so next time they login according to what it should do under process(), it should remove the ip and allow the player to vote again. [b]What I want it to do is keep the timer running for that player even when he logs out.[/b]</description>

              <p>Thank you above poster, I was able to create the following</p>
<p><code>			if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase("claim") &amp;&amp; c.voted==0) {
			c.sendMessage("You have not voted yet!");
			}
			if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase("claim") &amp;&amp; c.voted==1 &amp;&amp; c.VoteTimer==0 &amp;&amp; c.votereward==0) {
			if (!Connection.hasVoted(Server.playerHandler.players[c.playerId].connectedFrom)) {
			Misc.println("[VOTE]: "+c.playerName+" has claimed! ");
			c.getItems().addItem(6199, 1);
			c.sendMessage("Thank you for voting Creation");
			c.sendMessage("You have received a Mystery Box.");
						c.VoteTimer = System.currentTimeMillis() + 86400000;
						c.votereward = 1;
			Connection.addIpToVote(Server.playerHandler.players[c.playerId].connectedFrom);
			Connection.addIpToVoteList(Server.playerHandler.players[c.playerId].connectedFrom);
			}} else if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase("claim") &amp;&amp; c.votereward==1) {
			c.sendMessage("You have already claimed today.");
			}</code></p>
<p>and I got <code>		if (VoteTimer &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() &gt; VoteTimer) {
			voted = 0;
			votereward = 0;
			VoteTimer = 0;
			Misc.println("[VOTE]: "+playerName+" can vote again! ");
			Connection.VoteRenewal(Server.playerHandler.players[playerId].connectedFrom);
		}</code></p>
<p>In my client class under process, it works 100% and very well, thank you very much.</p>

              <p>An event would not obtain the desired result. If the server goes offline (for whatever reason, could just be an update) then you still get bad results.</p>
<p>Basically what you have to do is switch the VoteTimer variable to a long, then when someone votes, set the variable like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Now the votetimer is set to the current time, + a day (in milliseconds) so now all you have to do is</p>
<p><code>if (VoteTimer &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() &gt; VoteTimer)
                        Connection.VoteRenewal(Server.playerHandler.players[playerId].connectedFrom);</code></p>
<p>Then in your VoteRenewal method set VoteTimer to 0.</p>
<p>Now your timed thing will work no matter what happens.</p>

              <p>When the player votes make an event that is not attached to the Client class, this way it will still keep running even if the player goes offline.
