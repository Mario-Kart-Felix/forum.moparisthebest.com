    <description>[CENTER][IMG]http://i61.tinypic.com/4s1dtw.png[/img]

Hello and Welcome to my recruitment thread.
I currently am searching for a Development Team.

What is Agonia?

Agonia will be an upcoming RSPS, proving you what the word &quot;unique&quot; actually means. We&#39;ll be striving for a good community, and perfect clean code so the server can run flawless. Besides of that, there will be upcoming updates, maybe daily, maybe weekly, who knows in future? Im trying to make up the best RSPS experience for those players, who will try to play Agonia.

So, with this thread im trying to recruit people for my Team.

Positions :

Developer/Founder : Me
Server Developer : -
Server Developer : -
Client Developer : -
Graphics Designer : -
Funder : -

You can apply by filling this out :

[CODE]What&#39;s your IRL Name :
How old are you :
Do you have any experience :
Since how long are you in the RSPS Industry :
For which of the above place are you applying :
Do you have Skype? If yes, Name :
Do you have a microphone :[/code]

Thanks in Advance, hoping to find a few people. ;)[/CENTER]</description>

<p>Lirim is one of the biggest douches i’ve ever met.<br>
Not only did he pretend to be one of my mates…<br>
He also RAT’ed one of my moderators, so he could hack his skype (which he succeeded in), and he proceeded to use his trust to gain my website information, he also succeeded in that.<br>
As a matter a fact, i trusted him aswell.<br>
He backstabbed me more then i could have ever expected from him, and he has proven himself to be unworthy of being a friend or a partner in any way.</p>
<p>This is a warning, do not seek contact with this guy, he isnt the kind of person you want as a friend.</p>
