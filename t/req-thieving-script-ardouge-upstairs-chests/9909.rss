    <title>[REQ] Thieving script - Ardouge Upstairs Chests</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-thieving-script-ardouge-upstairs-chests/9909</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like a script that thieves from the two chests in an upstairs part of a house in Ardouge. There are two chests - one with a Nature Rune and 30 GP, the other with 50 GP. Both chests have traps.

So could someone makes a script that:

- uses antirandom stuff (running from gas that might come out of the chests)
- will move onto the second chest once the first has been looted
- will disarm the chest&#39;s traps BEFORE it opens them
- will say things or dance every now and then to avoid suspicion

Please? Thanks! :D</description>
