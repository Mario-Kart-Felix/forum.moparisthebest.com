    <description>I&#39;ve used the search bar already and didn&#39;t find any useful about this question.
[b]Please type in DUMBASS language as i&#39;m still a beginner at coding.[/b]

I would like to add Models &amp; Command id&#39;s to my server. But i have no clue where to add them. I wouldn&#39;t normally ask a question like this as Jesse (Maker of Rise/Teh Paradise) would help me.

How would i add these Models and Commands in and where..

All answers appreciated!</description>
