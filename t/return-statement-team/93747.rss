    <description>[center][b]Return Statements Team[/b]
[u]Scroll down to learn more...[/u]

[s]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/s]

[i]This is a team comprised of 3 or more people all dedicated to finding return statements. These will help in the direction of, when/if it happens, own, made weapons - all completeley made, with own GFX etc. A return statment is, normally, in the way we&#39;re using it, a statment that tells the client how to hold a weapon when running, walking and standing, and how to accept an item/weapon&#39;s way of holding before AND after an attack (*if any*) and the animation of the attack. This is very grueling work - most of the return numbers just freeze up the Mopar client. But, if we try, we can get MANY new weapon holds.

Some I have discovered:[/i]

return 2065; - hold like a dharok axe, over shoulder

return 2074; - a crossbow hold, in front of body

[i]I will not as of now tell where these belong or how to add them, unless you join - then, we share the wealth.

So, join today, and find something useful for the community.[/i]
