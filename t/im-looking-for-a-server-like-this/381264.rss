    <title>I&#39;m looking for a server like this</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-looking-for-a-server-like-this/381264</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having a bit of a hard time finding a server like this because of all the newer versions now a days. I&#39;m looking for a 317 server that comes with a client that it works with. Basically what I&#39;m looking for is one with no custom items, has shops, training spots and mini games. Skills don&#39;t matter too much. I remember seeing this a lot back in the day, any recommendations? 

Thanks for your time and help</description>

              <p>Well if you are looking for a base, you aren’t going to find many without customs… Thats all kids make these days. So you could you Hyperion, Runesource or Apollo. Although i don’t think apollo is even out yet… If you add in all the things you want im sure you would become better at programming.</p>
