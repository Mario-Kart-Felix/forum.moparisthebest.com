              <p>Well, you dont always have to have the working ::pass command. You can always go into the files, you char files, and search the person you want the pass too. Like making someone an admin, mod or co owner/ owner, just you will see there username and password at the top. Some sources have like a bunch of numbers as their pass.</p>
<p>Let me see if i can get the working ::pass command.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nope sorry, dont have my source on this comp. PM me later and I can get it for you.</li>
</ul>
