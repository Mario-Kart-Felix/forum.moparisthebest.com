    <description>Ok In the mist of my coding on my server source and client i somehow ruined the ability to attack anything, players or npc. Which file should i look under and what should i look up?

Also while i&#39;m at it can anyone post me to a tut or write a quick one on how to make it so u only have attack in wild? [br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 17, 2009, 05:41:57 pm[/size][hr]Bit more info on problem: When i try to attack (npc or player) it does the attack follow but no striking (with or without weapon) also npc&#39;s will realize you want to attack and swing at you.</description>
