    <description>1: Attacking Error
l) OK, when I use a melee weapon and attack a player, it hits them. Then when they walk away, my character doesn&#39;t follow them and they still get damaged. My character doesn&#39;t move, and still they get damaged even if they are far away. Does anyone know how to solve this?

ll) [b]Sometimes[/b] when I click to attack somebody, it does the hitting emote but the other player doesn&#39;t get hit at all. I have to wait a few seconds then click on them again for it to attack properly. Why is this?

2: Anti-lag
OK, I&#39;m 90% sure that there is some kind of code that stops lag. Whenever I click really fast on training objects in my server, it lags. When I try to click somewhere else, my character continues to train on the object and doesn&#39;t move to where I wanted to move to. I have to wait like ages before it moves. I&#39;ve tested many sources, and some of them doesn&#39;t lag, some does. The problem is... the training cases from those non-laggy servers are exactly the same as the one in my source I&#39;m using... On my original source, I have actionTimer in those cases already, but it still lags. Can somebody please tell me how to solve this lag?</description>
