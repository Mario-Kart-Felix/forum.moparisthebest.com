    <title>Get Billions Of GP a day, what do you think?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/get-billions-of-gp-a-day-what-do-you-think/23713</link>
    <description>Disclaimer- I don&#39;t condone any of this, it is just ideas for education, and I am not telling you to do any of this. If you get in trouble, don&#39;t bother blaming me, because these two lines of text protects me.

Hey,

     I was just thinking about when I used to have a private server, and how I could see all the profiles of the players, and stuff like when they log in, level, stuff like that. Well, then I realized, there are servers just like the private servers we run today. I myself live in South West Florida. For those who are uneducated of USA geography, it is the US&#39; only peninsula. Well, Miami is only 5 or 6 hours away from me and I go there sometimes with my family. Well, there is a few ways to go about this.

1.) Social Engineering- For those who don&#39;t know what this is, in laymans terms it is Social Hacking, manipulating people to get what you want (ie. passwords, keys, information ect.). So, you can just find out the host of the miami servers, I think it&#39;s xgaming, not sure though. Then get to know some of the people that work there. Become good friends with them, and then ask them for a favor. Ask them to copy the profiles on the server. I don&#39;t think you guys know what kind of choas this would cost. Your player profile (correct me if I&#39;m missing something.) includes your entire play time in miliseconds, your username, your password, your recovs, your bank pin, your inventory (in item id&#39;s), your bank inventory(in item id&#39;s), equip (in item id&#39;s) your levels, and your address, and I think a few other things. Now consider how many people log on those servers a day! At least 1500 people log on to a Miami server everyday. So that is at least 1500 people, with 1500 oppurtunities to make TONS of cash. Not only this but you could edit your profile to get higher levels, more items, and more!!! I mean, if you make a good friend, they&#39;re not going to mind just editing or copying some text files for you.

2.) Get a job there yourself- Apply, this one might be easier since you don&#39;t have to rely on them, or what if they back fire and call the cops. Then just follow the steps above.

3.) Break in- I don&#39;t condone this because you could get in a lot of trouble. You could just break in with a  cd or floppy, or a piece of paper, and copy the info of the accounts.

4.) Crack into the servers- Ha Ha Ha, I don&#39;t know why I even put this up here because I don&#39;t think anyone will, but if you wanted to, you could just crack into the server, then download all of the profiles.</description>

That’s pretty terrible if you consider your life being ruined because a guy on the internet is on your case quite often. Infact, that is really sad and I advise you to get off your computer and go outside. And besides, the reason james doesn’t like you is becuase your a scammer. You scammed on <a href="http://sythe.org" rel="nofollow noopener">sythe.org</a>(or tried to) and were banned for it. Quite honestly the best thing would be if the same rule was applied here, but there just isn’t any real proof I suppose.</p>

              <p>Lets say you DID get a job there, I’m sure the files aren’t stored onto the actual internet, but lets say the files where stored on a shared folder between 2+ computers, you login to the computer to access the files, you would need to download them and put them on a disk/floppy/external memory device. Once you have the files at a safe location you would need to decrypt them.</p>
<p>(To explain a little more, one computer and only one would be able to access them from a server, that bans all mac address’s apart from one, this computer. Once downloaded this computer would share maybe with some other computers, could not. This could hold key information, like security logs, player logs(example login details, automated/cheating report) and other stuff, this could allow staff to say check for cheating in more detail. Some files would say be encrypted, like login details and checked by a computer for attempts auto-crackers. The main idea of the original post and this idea, would be to get a job at Jagex, Cambridge, get access to these computers, my idea from this would be to download the login details, and on a safe computer not related to Jagex, decrypt these files to get the readable .txt versions, and login to accounts.)</p>
