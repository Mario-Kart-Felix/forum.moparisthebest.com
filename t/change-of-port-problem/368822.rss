    <title>Change of Port Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/change-of-port-problem/368822</link>
    <description>Hey, I have a newbie question here and was hoping somebody could help or simply give me a gentle nudge in the right direction :D

So I have a dedicated server up, and decided to put an RSPS on it. It&#39;s running on it&#39;s own account, and all the ports are open. Now, while it&#39;s running I head on to my computer and attempt to log in, it appears to work for a second, the GUI appears (the map and main screen is black, and chat is empty) and it holds this for a split second before disappearing.

This also happens on friends computers, our theory is that it is something to do with the ports. We believe that 43594 is not working as it should and we would like to change it to 5555. We have changed it in the source code&#39;s &quot;server.java&quot; but it still refuses to work.

Does anybody have any suggestions that could possibly help us? It would be veeeeery much appreciated :)</description>

              <p>I’m just using a Butterscape source, I changed from what I was using before because I couldn’t edit the port in it.</p>
<p>So right now I’m more interested in simply getting it online than making it good, so I simply but a source up that enabled me to change the ports. So I don’t think it could be the client.java, it’s been almost completely unedited except for the port change.</p>
<p>Do you or does anybody know what problem it might be if it’s not the ports?</p>

<p>The problem now is that when I try to connect it tells me I’m using an invalid username or password, I’ve tried a few different usernames and the “characters” file in the source is empty. The server is running etc.</p>
<p>Any help appreciated, anyone?[/quote]</p>
<p>Check your reading/writing in client.java</p>
<p>Also check your initiate/process method for anything suspicious. Try to look for where it’s doing it.</p>
<p>There’s more I could type but I have to go, I’ll be back to help later.</p>

<p>But I’ll answer your question anyway, you need to change it in server config too + remember to compile.</p>
