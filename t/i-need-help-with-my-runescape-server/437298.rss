    <title>I need help with my runescape server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-my-runescape-server/437298</link>
    <description>Alright, well i need help with the following things:

Order of running bats?
Edit both client and gui or just client?
what is the best Source+Client to use (From experience)?

Alright, so what i have been doing normally is just i edit client.java and sometimes i cant find the area to edit i search &#39;localhost&#39; &#39;127.0.0.1&#39; &#39;no-ip&#39; and sometimes if that does not work, i edit the GUI.java, then i will run the source and then run the client. and it will either give me an error on the bat or not run at all.

I have just been edidting the client.java but some of them i cant find the space to edit. so then i edit GUI.java

i want to find the best one that is currently working i dont care what build it is. thanks!</description>

              <p>What I got from your question is that you want us to recommend you a source. Requests aren’t necessarily allowed, for future references.</p>
<p>Anyways, this is a personal opinion, you shouldn’t go with what everyone says. If you want a clean build try something like runesource or hyperion. If you’re competent I would suggest trying out apollo, but that’s going to be a lot of work. I’m personally using a heavily modified PI and I’m content with it.</p>
