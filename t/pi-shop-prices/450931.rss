    <description>Hey, I have a problem in shops when you buy items and click value it says a price higher than it costs.

E.G. Warrior Helmet costs 60K when you click value it says 69K, If you have 69K in inventory and buy the helmet it removes 60K, How would I go about fixing this?

Thanks, RS PS</description>
