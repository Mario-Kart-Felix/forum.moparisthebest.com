<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>Hello there, Adventurer!  Looks like you’ve stumbled upon the wonderful server known as “CreativeScape.”  This isn’t your ordinary Runescape Private Server.  CreativeScape is dedicated to bringing you back to that incredible time period that we all fell in love with, Old School Runescape.  Our main objective is to make sure the player enjoys his/herself thoroughly, so we spend hours upon hours on perfecting that old school feeling we all love so much, with a hint of creativity, hence the name "Creative"Scape.  Below you’ll be able to enrich your mind with the incredible history behind this wonderful server, as well as some of the best features of it.  We hope you continue reading onward, because we know you won’t regret it!</p>
<p>History:</p>
<p>CreativeScape originally began its journey in April 2008, following it’s creation by R0cky 0wnz.  Since then, we’ve moved through the years delving into many different versions, such as CreativeScape Classic, Vexillum, CreativeScape V1 and CreativeScape V2.  We are currently moving through V3, which has been running since December 2012.  Here we’ve sat on the throne of private server royalty, remaining one of the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> Old School Runescape private servers of ALL TIME.</p>
<p>Our MANY Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A fun, loving, happy community of 300+, where anyone can fit in and make TONS of friends!</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Every single skill from Old School Runescape (excluding construction and hunter) can be fully trained, with multiple ways to go about raising your levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four custom and creative quests for you to enjoy, so that you don’t just finish leveling up and have nothing else to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A FLAWLESS combat system, giving you the PERFECT old school PKing/PvMing experience.</p>
