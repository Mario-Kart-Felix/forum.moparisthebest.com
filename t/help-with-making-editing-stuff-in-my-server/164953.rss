    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-making-editing-stuff-in-my-server/164953</link>
    <description>Hi, I have my server working and I theres a few things I wondered if some of you smart people (unlike me lol) help me edit. I know a little about this stuff but I&#39;m still a noob so if your not busy and are willing to help, then thanks very much, but if you are busying and don&#39;t want to help, I understand, so thanks anyways!

I can use a different server thing instead of pimpscape if I need to.

Im using pimpscape.

Things I want to do:
(X = Things completed)

1. Unlimited run for everyone
X 2. All newcomers start at castle wars
3. No experience is gained from teleporting
4. Tele on the emotes for Castle Wars
5. Make it so the max for any stat you can get is 99
6. Have a small place where players can train range, prayer, attack/str/def/hp, and mage anywhere as long as it is small and I can change the Tele emote to tele there.
7. Emote Tele for Duel Arena
8. Emote Tele for PK
9. You gain GP for attacking with range, mage, or melle on &quot;dummies&quot;
10. You gain different GP for each of the 6 Castle Wars Tables and diffrent levels required for each one.
EX,
1st tbl  -  lvl 1  5k,
2nd tbl - lvl 30 - 25k, 
3rd tbl - lvl 45 - 50k,
4th tbllvl 60 - 150k, 
5th tbllvl 75 - 500k,
6th tbllvl 95 - 1m

11. No arrows and no Runes required for ranging and spell casting but you must have lvl to cast spell.
12. In the Castle Wars Thieving Table Room, I need to make it to where on any of the 5 exits (stairs up and down, Ladder down, Door west, door east) will take you back to the Castle Wars Lobby
13. Emote tele for Castle Wars Lobby
14. Emote tele for Castle Wars thieving room


If Burgh De Rott don&#39;t work, then basically all I want is a small place where players can easily commute with each other and talk and train at the same time.

Please help.

Thanks to all that do!!![br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 15, 2007, 01:09:41 PM[/size][hr].</description>
