<p>Just threw this together real quick with the efficient help of javadocs, obviously not very well written in some aspects but it should do the job. Please note - I can’t comment on the safety of the JAR as I didn’t provide/check them. So if somebody wants to do that then nice one <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It shouldn’t take more than 20 seconds to complete the task, a large portion of waiting time is obviously downloading the JAR as the host isn’t that quick. If somebody wants to redo it to be better then I’d welcome that.</p>
<p>Maybe include a GUI and so on. If anyone can be bothered, then here:</p>

<p>Forgive the random indentations at parts, and my scattering of random code+numbers. I started experimenting with random functions that I didn’t remove completely part way through  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Oh yeah, I forgot it shows it all all the forums.  I just think something needs to be done.  Maybe have a link to the topic on how to downgrade in the rules, even though a good bit of new members don’t read it I’m sure some do.[/quote]<br>
I’m working on a launcher. if MITB wanted to put up the proper pages, and BIN, I could make it all redirect to moparcraft instead of Mojangs amazon stuff.</p>
