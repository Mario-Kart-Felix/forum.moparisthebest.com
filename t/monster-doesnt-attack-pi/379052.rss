    <title>Monster doesn&#39;t attack [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/monster-doesnt-attack-pi/379052</link>
    <description>Alright well I&#39;ve got a monster that doesn&#39;t attack, and you can&#39;t attack it if you add it through spawn-config.cfg. But if you spawn in using ::npc 2554, it works just fine. The monster is K&#39;ril Tsutsaroth, its ID is 2554. If anyone could go about telling me how to make this monster available for combat, that&#39;d be great. Sorry if this in the wrong section, I don&#39;t know where the problem lies.</description>
