    <title>How to Make, Host, and Maintain a Website *FOR FREE*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-host-and-maintain-a-website-for-free/13434</link>
    <description>Ok here we go.

For this project you will need the following:

1. Web Design Program, You can get Dreamweaver for free [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,1266.0.html#post_dw]here[/url]

2. A creative mind

3. This tutorial

Step 2- MAKING the website:

Okay, now that you have a good website design program, lets design the website. Say your making a game website that your friends can play at school, without getting blocked out. Open up Dreamweaver, goto the site menu, and make a new site. Every site needs a good layout, if your good with Photoshop, and want to be original, you can make your own, then for the unoriginal, lazy ignorant people, theres [url=http://www.freelayouts.com/]this place[/url], theres a ton of templates and generators here for free that you can use, or use as an outline to make your own, theres nothing wrong with building on others ideas. Now you have a new site, and you&#39;ve found a great template, but wait... don&#39;t you need web pages? When I&#39;m working on a website, I try to draw out a site map on paper, preferrably with pencil or erasable pen. A site map is like a tree, one page builds off of another, at the top of the tree is the home page, sort of like the index of the site, because you can access EVERYTHING with a url from the homepage, well guess what you call the index of a website, index! We use the name index.html because that is what search engines like google look for, not because your computer teacher said that&#39;s what you name it or you get an F. Anyways, try site mapping like this:

[img]http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/9774/sitemapkv8.jpg[/img]

Add your text, and if you need videos, check some out and add the code [url=http://youtube.com]here[/url]. If you want some games, check some out and add the code [url=http://arcadecabin.com]here[/url]. If you want some animations, you can make some and host them [url=http://photobucket.com]here[/url]. Now that your site is done, we can go to the next step.

Step 2- HOSTING the website:

Now that you have all the pages, we need to put them on the web. First, we need a free host. Some of the good ones are:

freewebs.com -Not my favorite because if you have forms, you can&#39;t use them for 7 days.
geocities.com -Pretty good
frihost.net -my favorite, gives tons of space and good bandwith

just register on one of those sites and upload all of your files, including the images. Make sure that if you made your own layout that the images aren&#39;t in a path like C:\yah da yah da yah\blah blah blah\image1.jpg, just make it \image1.jpg or images\image1.jpg if you created an image directory. Also, the less the size of your files, the faster they load. Don&#39;t go deleting text or anything, but try making it so all the files you have are linked to somewhere like rapidshare, and make all of your images jpeg. Once you have all your files hosted on one of these, it&#39;s time to make the url more professional. No one is going to take you seriously if your website url is freewebs.com/whatever, or whatever.geocites.com. But, there are better things, like url redirecting.

Some good ones are:
http://officelive.microsoft.com/ -This is THE BEST there is, during beta. This WILL give you a free domain with the ending of .com. IF you have a credit card. they give 50 free emails, traffic reports, and a ton of other awesome things.

freedomain.co.nr -Pretty good, will make your site whatever.co.nr

dot.tk -My favorite besides microsofts. Makes your site whatever.tk

no-ip.org -gives TONS of free redirecting.

now that you have your site hosted, learn how to maintain it.

Step 3- Maintaining your site:

Now you have a site, fully operational. Well, unless it&#39;s a site for your journal, tell people about it! If you used no-ip.org for a host then you can add your meta straight from them. If not, simply goto index.html and edit the &lt;head&gt; code. Add a &lt;meta =[u]add, the, stuff, about, your, site, here[/u] &lt;/meta&gt;. You can make money off your site even if a lot of people come, you can add some ads, even mopar does it, just don&#39;t sell out and have your loyal visitors bombarded with pop-ups when they come to your site. Add new stuff, make a news page, add a forum. Keep the site going strong! Have fun with it. Just keep updating your site.
