    <description>Hello my name is nivri, i am not new to the game of RSPS&#39;s.
I have owned multiple succesful, and failed projects. I met alot of interesting people along the path. 
I have had multiple names, and i may know alot of you. I decided to come back into the game, because i never truly accomplished
what i wanted when i was younger. And that was a thriving RSPS. I now have the resources &amp; funding, to make this happen. If you are looking to join, my team. Then you must meet at least one of the following criteria&#39;s:


[ol][li]17 of age+[/li]
[li]High Graphics skills[/li]
[li]Website designer[/li]
[li]High Pi knowledge base[/li]
[li]Have owned multiple servers before[/li][/ol]


My requirements are high, because i am shooting high. 
If you have a base, you would like to start on then pm me and we can talk about it.

Now some of you guy&#39;s are asking yourself&#39;s....What does he have to offer?

About me...
I have owned multiple servers. (players ranged from, 20 to 60)
I have managed forums and websites. (I own currently a forum community, with paid sponsors and advertisements. Have personal mybb designers creating a 200$ theme on it as we speak.)
I know and understand above average java coding. (I know some client sidded and server sided, basic fundamentals.
I have a Vps and domain ready to be activated. (I own multiple vps, because of my connections.)
I can promote the rsps. (I am not afraid, of spending money. I easily spent nearly 200$ on just promos for my forum.)
I have proper funding. (I have a career.) 

[b]This project well not fail, because i well not fail.[/b]
Lets make this happen.
