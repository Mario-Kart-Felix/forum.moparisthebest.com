              <p>If you want someone not to be able to edit or steal your source unless they are excellent coders which most people around here are not</p>
<p>make a backup of your server (the one you will edit will be this one)<br>
the one you give to hosters (you must compile it and then delete your .java files so that only leaves .class files that way they can’t edit it)</p>
<p>But they can still run the server…<br>
Pretty sure this infomation is correct <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>thanks is appreciated</p>
