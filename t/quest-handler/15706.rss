    <title>Quest Handler?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quest-handler/15706</link>
    <description>Anyone have one?

I expected Cheese to have one, but to no avail.

If anyone is working on one or has one currently, could you please post it or PM it to me?

All credit will be given in my server&#39;s advertisements as well as ingame.

Thank you for reading.</description>
