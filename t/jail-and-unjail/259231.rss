              <p>All of the basic codes that kids are asking for that im looking and finding around mopar now that i’ve come back… to be completely honest, you should all try to make these yourself. Its look and reference. All you have to do is look at methods from other codes like ip ban, and mix it with the mute method. And for the jail and unjail, you just have to make someone teleport to a certain location using some sort of victim process and teleblock them. They’re goign to have to have a skill in the char file called jailed though. (heads up).</p>
<p>Anyways, please try to figure stuff like this out yourself before coming here and asking for the code to be posted for you. Perhaps post an example of what you’ve previously tried, and we can help you on where you went wrong. You’ll have people saying this over and over, this is not a spoon fed community ;]</p>
