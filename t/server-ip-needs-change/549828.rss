    <title>Server IP Needs Change!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-ip-needs-change/549828</link>
    <description>Making a new thread because I can&#39;t reply to or edit my old one.

Originally I was using no-ip and because of their service shutdown I had to get it changed.

https://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?server=72.20.52.30

It should be &quot;world1.zarpor.com&quot;

Please update this for me, I&#39;ve pmed moparisthebest about it numerous times and it has been several months without anything done.

There is nothing I could have done to avoid this situation. The fact I&#39;ve spent thousands advertising here and I have the most votes out of any other server on the toplist, I think I would deserve some more consideration.

Please, it really doesn&#39;t take all that much effort to do this.
Thank you.</description>
