    <title>Vistex v7 remove damage soak</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vistex-v7-remove-damage-soak/542150</link>
    <description>recently damage soak has been screwing me. why its annoying is because my server is pvp server,ok to the point, what it does is when you get hit with a massive hitlike 340,the soak would be 7,they would stay alive by 7 hitpoints.so everyone in server looks like they get extremely lucky but its just a bug that prevented them from dieing.i really hope someone understands what im trying to say 


Look in screeny how i lived that hammer is like pring but i stayed alive due to damage soak as i drew my ghetto arrow showing you the connection
