&quot;Epic on your behalf&quot;[/b][/CENTER]

Hello,

I am Maruku the founder of the EpicScape project, this thread was made to show the progress the development team for EpicScape is making and to make a general awareness of this project.

What is EpicScape:
EpicScape is the current private server name for a general Runescape community known as EpicBots, we currently have a 100+ user activity rate and increasing, and many of them play private server and can&#39;t wait for it.

[B]Currently being worked on:[/B]

[ul][*]Website Layout started
[*]Logo started 
[*]Development team recruitment started
[*]Finding a good revision and source[/ul]


[b]Revision and Source:[/b]
We are currently in the process of deciding our revision and base, if you have any suggestions or good sources please post, I proposed the goal of making EpicScape the one server that will update as long as Runescape does, so any new features in Runescape should be added in EpicScape. The current development team and I are trying to find a good 667/711 souce, we have found some but have no idea where to start coding and how in some places.

[b]Development Team:[/b]
The Matrix team has inspired me to develop something similar, logically when you have one person doing all the work, its going to take a long time to get something done, but when users cooperate, and work as a team, more is accomplished and work is done faster, so we are currently going to be making a team of knowledgeable users in the field of coding a Runescape private server of java in general to help us develop the new generation of private servers.
