    <title>Upload for a Webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/upload-for-a-webclient/401853</link>
    <description>Hey everyone how do you do today,

basically I run a runescape market forum and everyone wants a Private Server.
I got 2 guys coding one for me and 1 guy doing the graphics.
I&#39;ve made a sub-domain for the webclient and the folder for everything.

What I don&#39;t understand now is how do I upload everything to get it to work.
How do I set-up the VPS.

Just to break it down and make sure everyone understands.
-I have a client + soruce.
-I have a website + hosting + VPS

What do I do now.
I&#39;d really appreciate it if someone can give me a set by set or a rough overview.
I&#39;m a good website coder so I&#39;ll understand the basics but other then that I&#39;d like some help on.

If I&#39;m aloud here is where the webclient should be:
www.webclient.varrockcity.org

^^Sorry if that isn&#39;t aloud PM me or admin remove it.

Thank you for reading.</description>
