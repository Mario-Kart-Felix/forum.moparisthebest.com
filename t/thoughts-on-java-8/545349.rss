    <title>Thoughts on Java 8</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thoughts-on-java-8/545349</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m just wondering what you guys thing of all of the new changes brought in with Java 8.

Personally, I haven&#39;t touched any of it. It seems like most of the stuff they added (lambda functions, collection streams, default interface implementations) were added to make the code more &quot;streamlined&quot;, but the hand off is that it introduced some complexity for human readers. For example, instead of 
[code=Java]
for (Player player : players) {
    for (Npc npc : player.getRegion().getNpcs()) {
        if (npc.isVisible()) {
            System.out.println(&quot;Npc: &quot; + npc.getName());
        }
    }
}
[/code]

There is now:
[code=Java]
for (final Player p : players) {
    p.getRegion().getNpcs().stream().filter(
        n -&gt; n.isVisible()).forEach(n -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;Npc is visible: &quot; + n.getName()));
}
[/code]

Sure, it takes up less lines of code, but the purpose is harder to discern.</description>

<p>Yeah. I noticed this creeping up in Java 7 as well. I think it’s bullshit that users have to change their security settings to run self-signed applications on websites now.

<p>You can buy a code signing certificate for like $10/yr? And it is a very small price to add on to the start up costs of your server. In most cases one donation will cover that?</p>
<p>If you are serious about being a developer of any kind then you would pay for a signing cert. Not only does it tell people you are serious, but it prevents people from manipulating your files and then trying to pass it off as you.<br>

Might have aimed a little too low there. Comodo had advertised $80/yr when I was looking earlier but can’t find it anymore. Even $300/yr is less than those sponsored servers pay for one month of being in the top. When you are that large it is definitely worth the expense.</p>

You can add specific websites to a whitelist that will allow self signed apps to run.<br>
However, you have to do it for every site that will have a Jar on it you want to run (that is self signed).</p>
<p>I’m glad they still offered some form of a feature where we can whitelist apps, but I don’t think they should have removed the setting entirely, I think we should have the option to put ourselves at risk (like chrome and downloading).</p>

One can understand their point. Java Drive By’s are so easy to hide in applications and so many people have been affected by fraudulent applets that they added it to help facebook crawlers from getting JDB’d everyday. It helps stop the bad guys but hurts the good guys.</p>
