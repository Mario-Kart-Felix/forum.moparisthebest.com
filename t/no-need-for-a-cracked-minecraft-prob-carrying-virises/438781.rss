              <p>There are some younger kids who can’t pay for it because they don’t have a method of payment and their parents more than likely don’t trust them to buy stuff online with their credit/debit card. There are a few good other reasons I can think of that people can’t buy the game because of, but I don’t have time I should have left the house already to go to a family “get together” lol</p>

              <p>Idk why people even ‘crack’ minecraft, you are paying a 1 time fee of, $25?, which isnt much. Not to mention you are provided with free,frequent, updates. The endless hours of gameplay is well worth the cash.</p>
<p>At first i did crack it, just to see what it was like, i quickly got into it and decided to pay up, and it was well spent.</p>
