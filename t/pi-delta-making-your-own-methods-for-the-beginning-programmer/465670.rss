    <title>[PI/DELTA] Making your own methods - for the beginning programmer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-delta-making-your-own-methods-for-the-beginning-programmer/465670</link>
    <description>[size=20pt][b]Intro[/b][/size]
I&#39;m writing this tutorial due my disappointment in a person 
and all other people wanting to program instead of just moving npc&#39;s around.
This guide is aimed on learning you the basics of programming
and will be explained like I&#39;d have to learn it my mom, for the real noob.

[b]We will be creating a basic skill throughout the tutorial.[/b]



[size=18pt][b]Let&#39;s get started.[/b][/size]
[size=15pt][b]Step 1: Making a class[/b][/size]
First of all we will be creating a new class, a .java file where we will be programming in we call a class.
Our compiler converts these .java files to .class files so they can be read and executed by our computer.

If you are using a PI, add a new java file in your skills folder,
if you are using Delta just add it with the other files.
Name it &quot;Crafting&quot;, if you already have a crafting file remove the other one.

In the new created file, we will first be opening our class and closing it.
Therefor add this on top:
[code=java]
public class Crafting {
}
[/code]
{ opens the class
} closes it

[i]All the upcoming things we will do have to be added between the &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot;[/i]

[b]You now have successfully created a new class![/b]


[size=15pt][b]Step 2: Creating a method[/b][/size]
We will be creating a void for our crafting, 
first of all you need to set up the constructor, the same way as making a class we open and close it:
[code=java]
public void cutGem() {
}
[/code]

[b]You successfully created a method![/b]


[size=15pt][b]Step 3: Continuing your method[/b][/size]
Now we want if we execute the method that our player will craft.
First of all we will need the data for it:
 - We know we need a chisel and uncut gems, so go lookup codes on a website like this: http://rspscodes.synthasite.com/
   and find the [i]chisel code[/i] and some [i]uncut gems codes[/i]. 
   looked those up for you, chisel = 1755, gems are: 1617, 1619, 1621, 1623 (diamond, ruby, emerald, sapphire)


[size=15pt][b]Step 4: IF statement[/b][/size]
Now to start off we will use an easy way of doing it to learn, the better way will follow later.
In your method so after the opening bracket, enter a line down and add this:
[code=java]
if (item1 == 1755 &amp;&amp; item2 == 1617 || item1 == 1617 &amp;&amp; item2 == 1755) {
}[/code]

[b]You successfully created an IF-statement![/b]

[i]If item one is the chiselID and item2 is the uncutID;
then it will look what to do after the { opening bracket.[/i]

item1 and 2 are what the player clicks in his inventory, if he does [i]&quot;use&quot;[/i] on [i]&quot;another item&quot;[/i] 
then use will be item1 and the other item item2.

that&#39;s why we added &quot;|| item1 == 1617 &amp;&amp; item2 == 1755&quot;
this basically means &quot;OR&quot; if item1 is the gem and item2 the chisel [i](if the player used the gem on the chisel instead)[/i]


[i]Now you are thinking, [b]where does item1 and item2 come from?[/b][/i]
In your constructur &quot;public void cutGem()&quot;
between (), add: &quot;int item1, int item2&quot;
so it looks like this:
[code=java]
public void cutGem(int item1, int item2) {
[/code]

[i]We will be adding this method in our packets first to continue the explanation,[/i]


[size=15pt][b]Step 5: Adding to our packet[/b][/size]
Now since this is cutting a gem (use chisel on uncut)
we want this method to be executed when a player uses a chisel on an uncut.
[b]Therefor we will need to add our method inside the item-on-item packet.[/b]

Hoping for you that your server is documented and tell which number is which packet,
else search for 
[code]case 53:[/code] 
in your client.java (delta)
for PI go to your packets folder and it should easily be named &quot;itemonitem.java&quot;

You should see some lines like this:
[code=java]
int usedWithSlot = c.inStream.readUnsignedWord();
int itemUsedSlot = c.inStream.readUnsignedWordA();
int useWith = c.playerItems[usedWithSlot] - 1;
int itemUsed = c.playerItems[itemUsedSlot] - 1;
[/code]
and some other lines like our method cutGem();
If not, make sure to add [b]after[/b] the lines shown above.
We will be adding this correctly later on, but for now just put 
cutGem(useWith, itemUsed);
I need this to explain you some things farder on.

Now you see we added useWith and itemUsed, where item1 and item2 is,
and if you inspect the code you see [i]useWith[/i] and [i]itemUsed[/i] come from some weird lines like [i]instream().getBigendiandzdez();[/i]

Those send what the player does ingame,
so if the player clicks use on his chisel it will send the chisel id to the packet, 
Here&#39;s an image to explain:
[img]http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/3657/zzzqk.png[/img]

So since our packet is active is it will read everything in it.
The &quot;instream.getBigWordEndian();&quot; and similar things are the data we get.
We save those to an int: 
[i]int firstitem = Instream.dekferg();  int secondItem = instream.dfere();[/i]

The server scans through everything added in the packet and then...
it reaches our method  &quot;cutGem(firstItem, secondItem);&quot; and executes it.

Our integers we declared in our void will now have the value of the clicked items ingame.
So basically our method now changed to this;
[code=java]
public void cutGem(1755, 1617) {
if (1755 == 1755 &amp;&amp; 1617 == 1617 || 1755 == 1617 &amp;&amp; 1617 == 1755) [/code]
[i]if we clicked the gem first, everything would be the opposite.[/i]


[size=15pt][b]Step 6: Continuing our method[/b][/size]
Now we have everything required to get out things working.
[b]So a short lookback:[/b]
[ul][li]We click on our chisel ingame and then on our gem.[/li]
[li]The client sends the data to our server.[/li]
[li]Server sees that you clicked &quot;use&quot; and then clicked another item.[/li]
[li]It makes the item on item packet run.[/li]
[li]The data of the client (chiselID and gemID) get added to the integers (useItem = c.instream....).[/li]
[li]It reads the methods in the packets and finds ours and executes it.[/li]
[li]Because we did this &quot;cutGetm([b]usedItem[/b], [b]otherItem[/b])&quot;, [i]item1[/i] and [i]item2[/i] in our void constructor get those values.[/li]
[li]Our void opens {[/li]
[li]Reads our if statement - if (item1 == # &amp;&amp; item2 == # || ...)[/li][/ul]


If we clicked ingame on other items than the 2 id&#39;s in the if-statement it will do nothing, because the id&#39;s are not right.
If it is right it will open [i]{[/i]
and read what we put there, we didn&#39;t put anything yet so we will do that now.

[i]We want to add a gem and remove the uncut one.[/i]
so behind the {
We add [b](delta)[/b]:
[code=java]
c.addItem(1607, 1);  //1607  is the cut gem
c.deleteItem(1617, 1); //1617 is the uncut gem
[/code]
[b]PI:[/b]
[code=java]
c.getItems().addItem(1607, 1);
c.getItems().deleteItem(1617, 1);
[/code]

But wait, the one who is really understanding the tutorial will now see that there&#39;s something not right.
[i]Where does that c come from? And the additem where&#39;s that?[/i]

The addItem method is located in our client.java class (delta) itemmanager(pi).
We can&#39;t just simply reach a method in another class so we have to call the class itself first which is c.
But the server wont know what c is, it&#39;s just a character being there so we have to show the server where it comes from.

So on top of your class under your opening {
add this: (capital C if using PI)
[code=java]
client c;

public Crafting(client cl) {
c = cl;
}
[/code]
Now the server will know that c comes from the client class and that is has to be called in the crafting class.

Now you see how we call things, you now where the c is coming from, 
Now you should realize that we added our cutGem in our packets without calling it, so it can&#39;t be reached to.
You are right it can&#39;t so we will fix that up now.

First of all go to your client class and add this under the opening { of the class
[code=java]
Crafting crafting = new Crafting(this);
public Crafting getCrafting() {
return crafting;
}
[/code]
[i]For PI or packaged Delta&#39;s don&#39;t forget to import your Crafting class!
If you forgot how to import, scroll up to where your imported your client class in your crafting class.[/i]

Now in your item on item packet where you added cutGem(
add infront of it &quot;getCrafting().&quot;
so it&#39;ll look like this:
[code=java]
getCrafting().cutGem(useWith, itemUsed);
[/code]

[b]Now it can reach to our cutgem method![/b]

For PI or packaged delta&#39;s we will also need to add a package declaration and imports.
On top above your class constructor we need to add this.
[code=java]
package server.model.players.skills;
[/code]
Locates our crafting file, its in that ^directory. (adjust to your server&#39;s packaging)

The path starts where the packaging started, so if you go to your Server.java you&#39;ll see on top &quot;package server;&quot;
This is the start and not src like some people think, src is just a folder.

Now we also have to import the packages where classes that we call are located, so we have to import our client class.
Under your package declaration add the package of your client class like this:
[code=java]
import server.model.players;
[/code]

If you now save and compile, go ingame and click the chisel on the diamond you&#39;ll see it will work.
If it doesn&#39;t you must have done something wrong.
If it is working, continue the tutorial.


[size=15pt][b]Step 7: Continuing our method[/b][/size]
Now we want that something happens for all the uncuts. 
One way is using easy [i]if-else statements[/i]:
[code=java]
public void cutGem(item1, item2) {
if (item1 == 1755 &amp;&amp; item2 == 1617 || item1 == 1617 &amp;&amp; 1755) {
c.addItem(1607, 1);
c.deleteItem(1617, 1);
}
else if (item1 == 1755 &amp;&amp; item2 == 1619 || item1 == 1619 &amp;&amp; item1 == 1755) {
c.addItem(1609, 1);
c.deleteItem(1619, 1);
}[/code]

So basically what this does now is looking to our if statement, and if it is not right it will go to our &quot;else if&quot; statement.
This way you can add all your gems and they will all work.


[size=15pt][b]Step 8: 2D Arrays[/b][/size]
[b]Now a better way of doing this is using an array or a 2D array.[/b]
We will store all our data in a 2D array.
On top of your class outside the method, add this and add the id&#39;s in the array.
[code=java]
private static final int[][] GEM_DATA = {
{1617, 1607}, //uncut, cut
{1619, 1609},
};
[/code]

Now remove everything INSIDE your void and add this instead:
[code=java]
for (int i = 0; i &lt; GEM_DATA.length; i ++) {
}
[/code]
This makes us loop through our array we just created.

Now,
[code=java]
for (int i = 0; i &lt; GEM_DATA.length; i ++) {
if (item1 == 1755 &amp;&amp; item2 == GEM_DATA[i][0] || item1 == GEM_DATA[i][0] &amp;&amp; item2 == 1755) {
c.addItem(GEM_DATA[i][1], 1);
c.deleteItem(GEM_DATA[i][0], 1);
}
[/code]

Don&#39;t mind the i, its from our loop, what you need to know is the numbers [b][0][/b]
That&#39;s the spot in the array
[code]{1619, 1609}[/code]

1619, is spot 0 or [b][0][/b]
1609, is spot 1 or [b][1][/b]

So -&gt; IF item1 == chiselID or FIRST_SPOT_OF_ARRAY (uncut gem)
then 
additem(SECOND_SPOT_OF_ARRAY, 1); (cut gem)
deleteItem(FIRST_SPOT_OF_ARRAY, 1); (uncut gem)


[size=15pt][b]Step 8: Variables.[/b][/size]
Now to give you a thought about variables,
we will be checking how many times the player made the method execute. (used a chisel on an uncut)

On top of your class but still in the class, add this:
[code=java]
private int count;
[/code]

[b]You just have declared a variable! (A primitive data type to be specific)[/b]

The variable we declared is an int, this holds values of decimal numbers.
By default the value it holds is 0.

[i]You can read up about different sorts of variables here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html[/i]
[code=java]
count ++; //increases by one
count += 1; //increased by the given value
count --; //decreased by one
count -= 1; //decreases by the given value
count *= 1; //multiplies by the given value
count /= 1; //devides by the given value
[/code]

[b]Now in our method we make the variable increase by one.[/b]
So our method should now look like this:
[code=java]
public void cutGem(int item1, int item2) {
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; GEM_DATA.length; i ++) {
      if (item1 == 1755 &amp;&amp; item2 == GEM_DATA[i][0] || item1 == GEM_DATA[i][0] &amp;&amp; item2 == 1755) {
         c.addItem(GEM_DATA[i][1], 1);
         c.deleteItem(GEM_DATA[i][0], 1);
         count ++;
      }
   }
}
[/code]

Now we want the server to tell our player the amount and we add this to it:
[code=java]
c.sM(&quot;You have cut &quot;+count+&quot; gems!&quot;); //Delta
c.sendMessage(&quot;You have cut &quot;+count+&quot; gems!&quot;); //PI
[/code]

The reason we are putting our variable between: &quot;++&quot; is because what we outprint is a String,
if we just add count in it, it will outprint &quot;count&quot; and not the value of our variable.
Therefor we put our variable between: &quot;++&quot;

Now every time the player cuts a gem he will also get the amount of gems cut send in his chatbox.



Took me a while to write all this, I hope it will help some of you beginners.
Also:
If you&#39;re interested in learning the java language itself, or you find things you don&#39;t know what they are.
It&#39;s highly recommended from instead hopping in the help section using these docs provided by Oracle.

That’s my story. Everything I know (very little) is from rsps. Never got a book, never read a doc, just kept going. Eventually understood functions such as switch statements and arrays and those stuff.</p>

I knew how to make a void even when I first started, as I started off programming separate things in Java before I actually decided to advance into RSPS. Not really an advance though IMO.</p>
<p>This isn’t worthy of the featured section, but it is a nice although there are tutorials all over the internet on how to create a void and use an array. Good Job?</p>
