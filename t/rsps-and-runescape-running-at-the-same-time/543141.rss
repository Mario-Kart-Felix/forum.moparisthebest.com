    <title>RSPS and RuneScape running at the same time</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-and-runescape-running-at-the-same-time/543141</link>
    <description>Was just wondering if it&#39;d be dangerous to run a server from the same computer on which you play RuneScape.

For example, right now I&#39;m playing the official RuneScape game whilst toying around with my server. Could that get my RS Account in trouble? Have you ever heard of a friend getting banned because the game detected they had a RSPS running on their machine while playing?</description>

No, and I believe it’d be illegal for them try and check that.<br>
You can play as much as you want and code, or whatever.[/quote]It’s not illegal, some anticheat systems use it. They just have to have you agree and people check the source often to make sure it’s not doing more then it’s supposed to.</p>
<p>However, I’m pretty sure Jagex doesn’t do it, so you should be safe.</p>
