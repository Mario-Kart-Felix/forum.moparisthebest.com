    <description>[center][size=8pt][b][u]Introduction[/u]

Hello. I&#39;m looking for a development team. I&#39;m thinking between 2 and 4 people recruited. I&#39;m looking for beginners because I am a beginner, but I believe I could be a lot more productive if I work with others, and this is something I&#39;ve been wanting to do for a while now.

[font=georgia][/font][/b][u]Why I&#39;m making this project[/u]
I&#39;ve been wanting to pimp out a server for a while now... I just want to do it so I can learn from it &amp; move on. I&#39;m looking to really make this server
the best it can be.

Positions Needed:
Server Developer x1-x2
Client Developer x1-x2
GFX Developer x1
Other (random talent) x1-x2

Update log:

[End]


[b]Application:
           -I give no permission for anyone to release this for any reason other than me: PI_Developer


Skype(withHeadset):

Just as a reminder, I&#39;m looking for beginners, you can&#39;t know nothing, but you can know enough.
