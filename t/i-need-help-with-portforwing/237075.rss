<pre><code class="lang-auto">Number: 479 	Type: Ghost/Electric 	Does not evolve</code></pre>
<p>Rotom (ロトム, Rotomu?), is a small, floating Pokémon whose body consists of plasma. It has been known to enter electrical devices and wreak havoc. The only available Rotom in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl resides in a possessed television in an old haunted château. Rotom is both Electric- and Ghost-type, making it immune to Fighting- and Normal-type attacks (but weak against Dark attacks and Ghost attacks), and its Levitate ability makes it immune to Ground-type attacks, making it the only electric Pokémon aside from Zapdos to have this immunity. When a wild Rotom is encountered in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, the music that plays is the “Legendary Theme;” however, and despite being genderless, Rotom is able to breed with Ditto, and is not considered to be a legendary Pokémon.</p>
<p>Pokémon Platinum introduces five new forms of Rotom, accessible by using the Secret Key item to unlock a hidden room within the Galactic Headquarters in Eterna City: Frost Rotom, Wash Rotom, Cut Rotom, Spin Rotom, and Heat Rotom. Each form’s appearance corresponds to a household appliance (a refrigerator, a washing machine, a lawn mower, a desk fan, and an oven, respectively), and is able to learn an elemental attack exclusive to itself, which is lost upon conversion to another form, despite that each form retains the Electric/Ghost-type</p>

              <p>kk i can tell u the hard way or the easy way</p>
<p>The easy way it to buy the port fowarding programe (which costs $30)</p>
<p>Or the hardway</p>
<p>do it all yourself by logging into your rotur and doing it all your self</p>
<p>Ps. if u have a net gear rotur then the user is admin and the pass is password</p>
<p>I’m no expert on doing port fowarding so i recomend doing the easy way so then u can just create any server u like lol</p>
