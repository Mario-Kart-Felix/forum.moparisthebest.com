    <title>I need a Auto Restarter that works and saves players</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-auto-restarter-that-works-and-saves-players/171649</link>
    <description>Ok I tried to use two different auto restarters and none of them make me satisfied.

First I used a command to restart which restarts and saves players but runs stealth and sometimes it doesen&#39;t work.

Second I used Voule Auto Restarter.exe with Voule.bat and I think I set it up right and when it restarts it doesen&#39;t save peoples files so they lose items/xp etc.

Please help me!

Thank You</description>

              <p>lol my auto restarter is kinda ghetto, what i do is i have an auto save so it saves every ones game like 2-3 times a minute, then i have a my guy logged in sitting in some remote place, i have a scar script that loggs him out and in, and if it cant log him in it restarts, and i also have it auto click my port checker that i made, if the port returns as closed or w/e, i have it restart. could do something like that, or you could do something simpler, idk…</p>

<p>Anyways my server is allready established and has avg of 40-50 people at all times. I just got back from work finding my server crashed again 12 hrs later. I really need to put a auto restarter.

<p>Thats all I’m asking.[/quote]</p>
<p>just fix the errors that cause it to crash, my server has been on for 24 hours with no restart and no crash.</p>
<p>but if you wan’t a good restarter either make a scheduled task which can be done in the control panel or use voule because it is the best one</p>

              <p>Ok I tried to use two different auto restarters and none of them make me satisfied.</p>
<p>First I used a command to restart which restarts and saves players but runs stealth and sometimes it doesen’t work.</p>
<p>Second I used Voule Auto Restarter.exe with Voule.bat and I think I set it up right and when it restarts it doesen’t save peoples files so they lose items/xp etc.</p>
<p>Please help me!</p>
<p>Thank You</p>
