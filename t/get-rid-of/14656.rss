    <description>guys how do i get rid of spy sweeper 5. something trial version. i used moveonboot but it said it failed. i want to get rid of it becuase i searched on morpheus for a carck for spy sweeper but i only found one for 4. something version. it said i had to uninstrall the new version. if you do not know how to get rid of it can someone post me the links or something to get a crack or serial for ver 5. something? i dont want to go onto the sites that arnasses14 suggested to find serails because my parents are around often and some sites have you know what. so i would apperciate it if someone posted me a crack/serial for the latest version of spy sweeper and help will be greatly appreciated.

thanks, sid</description>
