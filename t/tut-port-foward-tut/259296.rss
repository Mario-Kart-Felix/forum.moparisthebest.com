    <title>TUT ~~~Port Foward~~~ TUT</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-port-foward-tut/259296</link>
    <description>Ok i have seen this many times and i had trouble ages back with it myself.

 1.press start
 2. press &quot;run&quot;
 3. type &quot;cmd&#39;
 4. a black box should come up like this.
 [IMG]http://i281.photobucket.com/albums/kk215/milomakes/HELP.jpg[/img]
5. type &quot;ipcofig&quot; and press enter.
[IMG]http://i281.photobucket.com/albums/kk215/milomakes/HELP2.jpg[/img]
6. (this is for most computers)open up google and type 192.168.1.1 in the adress bar.

7. this is for most routers and if your parent/ the person who installed your network left the password and user at default the username should be admin and the password=password. 


8. once in find LAN ip setup (you should have 1) where i said &quot;your ip at step 5 click add and type your ip adress in your mac adress and your computer name.[IMG]http://i281.photobucket.com/albums/kk215/milomakes/HELP4.jpg[/img]

After this go to port fowarding/port triggering. and add the name as moparscape the port (whatever port you want) and the ip (your computer lan ip adress)




this was for my netgear router NOT ALL OF THEM ARE THE SAME!

Hope this helps some of you if you have further questions post here or pm me. please do post and rep if you think im worthy of it.</description>

              <p>Lol… Thats really gay. Were do you live and what internet company do you have? Only way you could fix that is instead of plugging into a router plug straight into the modem, because if your plugged into you don’t have to open ports. But there prob a way around opening ports so that they wouldn’t know, but I would take the risk of them making it so you can no longer use them as a provider… Even though they seem to blow…</p>

JUST A WARNING TO SOME WHO STILL CAN’T PORT FORWARD:<br>
(I’ve done this for many friends and from my personal router I have tons of trouble)<br>
Uhm, my ISP and Router don’t cooperate together.<br>
I believe I have to put the modem into bridge mode and then configure the router in a special mode such as PPPoE</p>
<p>I don’t care enough to do it but just a heads up to you guys.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Totally not a reason why port forwarding on your router doesn’t work… Yeah your ISP does block some ports like port 80 and 21 , because those are ports that people can use to connect to your computer when you don’t know it. Most the the reason people can’t get port forwarding to work is because they ether have a Virus Protection Program, Didn’t add ports to both firewalls, or they haven’t setup a static ip so that it doesn’t change your IP and the ports no longer work. If your really having that much trouble fixing your ports to work i’ll be glad to connect to your comp through team Viewer or VNC and see what the problem could be. Also when I say people don’t add the ports to <span class="bbcode-b">BOTH</span> Firewalls , I say that because you have to add the ports to another part of the windows firewall settings.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT:</span> Also I don’t think these thread belongs in this forum.[/quote]</p>
<p>Like I’ve said, I’ve done this for many people though and my computer was the first one to ever give me such difficulty. My ISP sucks ass in terms that they don’t like allowing ports to be forwarded and if they actually find you with ports forwarded they will “suspend” your access to the internet unless you have a special license/plan/contract with them. I’ve had them threaten to drop me before and now it seems like they finally put a way to end me forwarding my ports.</p>
