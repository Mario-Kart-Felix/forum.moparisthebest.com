    <title>Craigslist easy-poster?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/craigslist-easy-poster/542822</link>
    <description>Hey guys. I&#39;ve got this gig-like thing where I&#39;m making money via selling someone else&#39;s shit on craigslist. Basically, I get paid if he gets paid. So, I want to market as many products as possible.

I want to write some form of script, or whatever would be needed, to make posting to craigslist easier. I will only be selling items, nothing more, meaning the &quot;type&quot; won&#39;t change (I saw this in the url, I believe they use php GET_ for it). But each post has an auto-generated url (go to craigslist and hit the post button, you&#39;ll see what I mean). Then from there you select the type and the next page will add &quot;?s=cat&quot; on it (cat is for &quot;for sale by owner&quot; option). The next part is where you select the item type. This will vary, so I&#39;d have to make some form of a selection box. After that selection, is the key page. I want the contact information to be auto-filled (since I&#39;m doing this for the same person X times over), as well as the location and general shit like it.

Lastly, I&#39;d want to save the urls, I understand I could look them up in my account, but I want to quickly link him to each one after it&#39;s posted.

I don&#39;t care what language I have to write this in (as long as I know it). I prefer Java, just because it&#39;s my strong suit. HTML/PHP is fine as well, I can even write a flash app (rofl) for it. I don&#39;t know RoR, Perl, or shit like that. Never got far in web dev.</description>

<p>No because I didn’t even see that on the site, so I’ll look at it and report back.<br>
Edit: They have a sample written in perl5 and it returns some RSS. I’ll have to look into converting or writing similar.</p>
