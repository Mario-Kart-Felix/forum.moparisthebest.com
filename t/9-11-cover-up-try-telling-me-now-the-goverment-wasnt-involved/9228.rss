              <p>Honestly I do not like Bush as president, but if he was involved do you really think that from January to September was enough time to plan all this?</p>
<p>One of my biggest problems is that with beliving this and how could Bush be involved? He is a complete idiot and there is no way he was smart enough to pull this off.</p>
<p>Also, haven’t there always been theries saying that someone with power was involed?For example what about John F. Kennedys assassination. There are many theiores and there is a thery I belive it was called the X factor that someone from the goverment up to even the the Vice president had been involed with the assassination of John F.Kennedy.I don’t belive there is any evidene since John Harvey Oswald ( belived to have fired the shot that killed JFK) and Jack Ruby( the one whp hired Oswald) are both dead. So this will just be another Cold Case.</p>
<p>I think this is also another theiry, but its just not true.</p>

              <p>ok you fuckwits that are just constantly flaming, saying its all fake, its impossible, america is <span class="hashtag">#1</span>. Either Open your eyes, or close your mouths, or at least start supplying evidence to support your claims, cause this video is more than youve supplied so far other than smartass comments.</p>
<p>Wether you think it was a coverup or not, you cannot deny evidence until you look at it, so before you start saying its all fake, look at the video.</p>
<p>I watched it a few days ago, and i was drawn in, but not totaly convinced, so i went further than any of you idiots have gone, and actualy tried to find out more information, i found some of the records, i checked the public government files. Virtualy everything on that video is true and the things that wernt, whernt lies either, as they couldnt be disprooved otherwise.</p>
<p>I then went a step further, and researched various other ‘events’ that have happened in america, including the Kenedy assination and Pearl Harbour. There is undisputable proof for people that care to actualy look that prooves these where both cover-ups, as where many other events that have transpired in american history.</p>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>my opinion is, the american government is corrupt, and is willing to do anything to get what it wants, including hurting its own people. Where will it stop? Who knows, but i for one do not plan to sit idly bye, while America desides they want something and kills me or people i know to get to it.<br>
Wether you believe my opinion or not, it is not ok to flame it, your entitled to your opinion, and im entiled to mine.</h2>
<p>People who would like to talk further about this pm me please, being a Criminologist in training (which is International Security stuff) i have alot of interest in this kind of stuff.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Thats my 2 cents, you can keep the change</span></p>

<p>[quote=“Xerxes, post:20, topic:9228”]Yes. They would kill 3,000 to make new laws, attack a few countries, higher security, get “big brother” going etcetc.</p>
<p>Do you guys even think? No. Do you know anything about conspirancy? No. Do you read books? No. Do you listen? No. Do you know anything about US history and similiar stuff? No. Do even know what happends in background when something like 9/11 happends? No.</p>
<p>No one of you should post because you have simply no idea. I think I will start answering your questions and talk to you - go on.[/quote]</p>
<p>In the last 3 days ive reserched my ass off on US history and the supposed ‘coverups’<br>
I think i have a fairly good idea what happened now during 9/11, aswell as the pros and cons from America, and the supposed ‘terrorists’.</p>
<p>Now, where you simply flaming the people that didnt have an idea, or where you flaming the idea of a conspiracy itself? Im not sure where you stand on this matter Xerxes</p>

<p>I agree BUT. If i was accused of something so bad that i hadnt done like terrorism i’d be like fuck you all im going to do it now. I mean if it is true and bush was behind 9/11 think about all the innocent people dieing in the hands of the american &amp; british army? Wouldnt you be angry if your people were dieing for no reason and you were being used as a escape goat so that the invaders could have a reason to come into your country?</p>
<p>However i think the terrosists are going about it the wrong way. Blowing more people up isnt going to solve anything.</p>

<p>What evidence are you talking about? The video some kid in college with too much time on his hands made? Do you think people view that as an authority of the events of 9/11 and the continuing war on terror? Why would it confirm what you are thinking? Do you believe everything you see?</p>
<p>No, nuclear weapons aren’t just “hanging outside,” that is what you implied when you said we have satelite mapping to uncover them.</p>
<p>I never said nothing is kept secret, but the consequences of the revelation of such a conspiracy would mean an end to America as we know it. Why would anyone be willing to take that gamble?</p>
<p>Your last sentence makes no sense at all, I have no idea how it plays into your argument–in fact it rebukes it.</p>
<p>Xerxes: “Your post make no sense at all.” Do you think that makes sense, idiot? You can’t even come up with a coherent response to what I have said.[/quote]</p>
<p>Because I cant bother reading your smartass comments.</p>

<p>We live in diffrent places. Here they are all perceived as terroists.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Where have i said iraq’s hate american’s?</li>
</ol>
<p>AND no its not complete bullshit, you dont live here so go die. As you may know there was or still is a mass evacuation undergoing, one man i cant rememeber his name boasted how he had a huge house, 5 children and had never worked here whatsoever and he told the papers, it was published he was kicked out the country he also said how he thought terroists are great, during the mass evacuation he asked to come back, his request was denied as he was no longer a uk citizen. HA goverment aid? I think its great we accept refuges but alot of them take the piss. You go to london, deep into it and try and find a single english person the goverment is giving them more than just aid. However who can blame them? If your offerd money, your bound to take it.</p>
<p>The last sentence i made clearly is not part of the arguement, all i was saying is i dont think terroism is good so dont get the wrong idea.</p>
<p>I make many typo’s and im proud that i dont triple check my posts for spelling errors or punctuation errors.</p>
