        <p>[quote=“runescape192, post:18, topic:9228”]why wouldn’t I look…</p>
<p>Cause its all a bunch of Bullshit</p>
<p>Do you really think that they would kill over 3,000 Americans? what are they just hiding and they will all come out and say peek a boo?<br>
No its a bullshit i don’t give a dam. ill even staret watching it right now.[br][size=1]Posted at: August 13, 2006, 12:22:45 PM[/size][hr]I am not no bush lover but I do not think it was a coverup. this movie is all bullshit lies!</p>
<p>let me see the real documents thoses were just ones made on his computer.</p>
<p>Don’t any of you think that just mabey we would have heard reports on the news or anywhere and Bush would have been impeached and anyone else involved?[/quote]</p>
<p>If you read my post, watch the film first before replying. He gave answers as to why he thinks it happend and back it up by evidence. Millions of dollars worth of gold was taken from the trade centers THE DAY BEFORE september the 11th. Bush got alot of popularity from saying he was going to war. I cant remember the other reasons but theres a few more in that video, everything is backed up by evidence. There is video footage in there on bin larden admitting he was behind sept 11th however from looking it you can see how it is fake and it looks like its not bin larden at all. Infact theres significant proof that its not him.</p>

<p>Watch the video, then come and tell me that. There is a major possiblility the video was fake. It even gives that video footage of them admitting it, in this video and tells you whats wrong with it. View it.</p>

Hey kid, what the fuck do you know? It is beyond me why a 14yr old twat is trying to act as some kind of authority on the bullshit he is pulling out of his ass.</p>
<p>Oh, and Taios, you’ve obviously done your research on Bin “Larden”. You can’t even remember a single example from this movie you are rambling about (which I had already wasted my time watching).</p>
<p>Same with you Xerxes, it’s spelled Al Qaeda, you stupid fuck–and it was formed in 1979 following the Soveit war in Afghanistan.  Do you even know why Bin Laden hates America? How and why Al Qaeda was formed? Why Bin Laden has been trained by CIA operatives? Do some fucking research you ignorant fuck.</p>
<p>If Bin Laden truly isn’t responsible, don’t you think the U.S. would stage a capture and put him to death to put an end to it?</p>
<p>What the fuck do you know about history past your 7th grade education? You want to talk about extreme-leftists? Look no further than the the teachers in our public education system.</p>
<p>I think what you should do is grow a brain of your own and stop with your bullshit conspiracy theories, you don’t know the first thing about what you’re saying.</p>

<p>You are supposed to be persuading me as to why the american goverment is not involved? I am sorry but you have just done a bad job.</p>
<p>Hasnt the american goverment thought he was dead? They were then shocked to see him on tv, live and well. They cant catch him.</p>
<p>I was talking to a army guy at school, we had loads visit and someone abruptly asked him. How the hell do you know there are weopans in iraq? His reply was, we have an aeroplace to skim the earths atmosphere and from there can read a newspaper from all the way down on earth, you cant tell me there are no nucleur weopans, they just arnt in iraq. So why on earth have they sent an army to iraq? I am looking for answers to questions as much as the next person and that video answerd them for me pretty well.</p>
<p>“think what you should do is grow a brain of your own and stop with your bullshit conspiracy theories, you don’t know the first thing about what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>You havnt even explained what you know. I am entitled to my own opinion and im open for a discussion for other people to put across all their opinions. You have not done that, in stead you have attacked me and Xerxes and not even given us something to argue, you have given us no points that american goverment was not involed. Instead to me you come across as a victim of brainwashing.</p>
<p>I have disliked the iraq people since september the 11th alot of hate has been influenced on us by our goverment in the UK, of course also other peoples opinion would influence ours aswell, also the fact one man was boasting he hadnt worked a day in his live, came here brought 3 houses and had 5 children i mean wtf? I also began to hate them for their terrorism irrational behavior but if it is indeed true that the september 11th was not only planned and excecuted by Al Quada but by the american goverment then they have betrayed their people and i am ashamed of the british goverment mainly tony blair got kissing george bushes ass and sending the english army to iraq aswell.</p>
<p>I am not trying to say al Quada had nothing to do with it but untill someone comes up with a GOOD ARGUMENT that the american goverment was not involved, i keep my opinion they were.</p>
<p>Just because the goverment may have been involved you cant blame the american people and i find some americans when this point is put forward jump to the conclusion they are being blamed for it. You cant sterio type anyone it would be the goverments fault, not its people.</p>
<p>Also muslims, germans etc. You cant blame the majority on the minority. That is my opinion.</p>

<p>Hey kid, what the fuck do you know? It is beyond me why a 14yr old twat is trying to act as some kind of authority on the bullshit he is pulling out of his ass.</p>
<p>Oh, and Taios, you’ve obviously done your research on Bin “Larden”. You can’t even remember a single example from this movie you are rambling about (which I had already wasted my time watching).</p>
<p>Same with you Xerxes, it’s spelled Al Qaeda, you stupid fuck–and it was formed in 1979 following the Soveit war in Afghanistan.  Do you even know why Bin Laden hates America? How and why Al Qaeda was formed? Why Bin Laden has been trained by CIA operatives? Do some fucking research you ignorant fuck.</p>
<p>If Bin Laden truly isn’t responsible, don’t you think the U.S. would stage a capture and put him to death to put an end to it?</p>
<p>What the fuck do you know about history past your 7th grade education? You want to talk about extreme-leftists? Look no further than the the teachers in our public education system.</p>

<p>I was talking to a army guy at school, we had loads visit and someone abruptly asked him. How the hell do you know there are weopans in iraq? His reply was, we have an aeroplace to skim the earths atmosphere and from there can read a newspaper from all the way down on earth, you cant tell me there are no nucleur weopans, they just arnt in iraq. So why on earth have they sent an army to iraq? I am looking for answers to questions as much as the next person and that video answerd them for me pretty well.</p>

Your argument is barely coherent, your spelling and grammar are terrible and you don’t seem to have a focal point.</p>
<p>Do you think the U.S. govt. can frame a billoinare oil-heir who runs one of the largest terrorist organizations in the world and get away with it? Bin Laden has many media outputs to his disposal, and he used those to claim responisibility for the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>Your argument about satelite mapping is pointless, b/c they could use a building such as a hospital or another civilian structure as cover.</p>
<p>You tell me you are entitled to your own opinion, but you only developed these ideas by watching that movie; YOU are the one that is brainwashed.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with Vietnam? We declared war on that country under false pretenses, Lyndon Johnson staged an attack on a battleship at a harbor and we subsequently went to war.  We found this out b/c I believe there is a law that states after x amount of time private govt. documents are released to the public.  Now, even if 9/11 was an inside operation &amp; off the record, the idea of someone unraveling the truth would be catastrophic. If the people of the U.S. were to find out about such a conspiracy, complete chaos would ensue and we as a country would lose our credibility and merit–our foreign relations would be non-existant (let’s not even get started on how the American people would react, and how our economy would fall into its deepest depression), everyone involved would surely face the death penalty, and America would no longer be a superpower.</p>
<p>Your last bit makes no sense at all, who is blaming the citizens of the United States? Why would  you ever hate the Iraqi people? What have they done? What has our govt. implied they as a people have done? Do you even know what the fuck you are on about?</p>
<p>Let me also paste something from a link posted in this topic as a response:</p>
<p>Whatever reason it may be that the government supposedly orchestrated this conspiracy, it must have been worth it to them to cause so much suffering and loss of life. So if there’s any truth to this, then you can bet your ass that the government wouldn’t let a couple of pecker-neck chumps with a couple of Macs and too much time on their hands jeopardise their entire operation by letting this stupid video float around on the Internet. I can picture you morons emailing me now: “BUT MADOX, MAYBE DYLAN POSTED IT ON THE INTERNET BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT HAD A CHANCE TO REMOVE IT LOL.” Yeah, too bad this rebuttal is inconsistent with the premise of Dylan’s shit-festival of a movie: that the WTC was brought down “in a carefully planned and controlled demolition … and it was pulled off with military precision.” Now we’re expected to believe that the same government that was able to commit the largest terrorist operation in history–with military precision no less–is suddenly too incompetent to sniff out and shut down a little website set up by some college losers within days, if not minutes of its creation?</p>

<p>“Your argument is barely coherent, your spelling and grammar are terrible and you don’t seem to have a focal point.”</p>
<p>Spelling is not my strong point, i hate english. Math is much better as it requires you to use your brain alot more, yet i suggest if you are to attack someones spelling then you dont make spelling mistakes yourself. For example, “billoinare”.</p>
<p>The video i saw was not an act of brainwashing, it gave its point, evidence and explination and allows peopel to come to their own conclusion. It doesnt just completly say, "The american goverment are to blame for 9/11 continuously untill you believe it.</p>
<p>The last bit i was assuing. I am NOT american, but by me putting the point across that the american goverment is to blame i have had a few getting angry as if i was blaming the americans for it.</p>
<p>“Why would  you ever hate the Iraqi people?”</p>
<p>Dcthugs told me that iraq people and muslims are now continuously looked down upon in america because of september 11th, they are also steriotyped in the UK as terroists, this is what i was referring to. I walked down the road with a friend who was muslim, a man cuts in front of us turns around and stands there and just stares at her with a look of hatred. I was constantly in debate with her about muslims, how they live, the terroism aswell. They are steriotyped, terroism is against their religion. Just because a minority of people do something stupid the rest are thought to do or be the same. Why would you hate the Iraq people? 1 reason could be because some of their people are supposed to have blown up the two towers, here in the UK hate is generated by the fact the come here, get massive houses and dont even have to work for them.</p>
<p>If someone wants to cover the truth, someone will cover the truth, why would there be this much evidence against the american goverment if they were not involved? Do you really think that every peice of information is released to the public and there are no secrets?</p>
<p>Also, you cant expect nucleur weopons to just be hanging around out side can you? I assume they have some sort detection equipment for them, else they wouldnt have found the other ones.</p>
<p>Now, I am not standing up for terroism, saddam had to be stopped however way you looked at it, he was a threat to the world and murderd his own people.</p>
<p>@ Xerxes : LMFAO!!!</p>

<p>We live in diffrent places. Here they are all perceived as terroists.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Where have i said iraq’s hate american’s?</li>
</ol>
<p>AND no its not complete bullshit, you dont live here so go die. As you may know there was or still is a mass evacuation undergoing, one man i cant rememeber his name boasted how he had a huge house, 5 children and had never worked here whatsoever and he told the papers, it was published he was kicked out the country he also said how he thought terroists are great, during the mass evacuation he asked to come back, his request was denied as he was no longer a uk citizen. HA goverment aid? I think its great we accept refuges but alot of them take the piss. You go to london, deep into it and try and find a single english person the goverment is giving them more than just aid. However who can blame them? If your offerd money, your bound to take it.</p>
<p>The last sentence i made clearly is not part of the arguement, all i was saying is i dont think terroism is good so dont get the wrong idea.</p>
<p>I make many typo’s and im proud that i dont triple check my posts for spelling errors or punctuation errors.</p>
