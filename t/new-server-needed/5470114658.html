        <p>You guys can make custom quests to add incentive to actually DO quests. Quests, for the most part, aren’t rewarding EXP wise. I was thinking maybe making bounties (kill people in the wild x amount of times), or (do this quest twice). Let me try to explain a little more in detail.</p>
<p>As I’ve been playing Destiny, I like the setup they have. They have a really nice PvE setup, and then a decent PvP setup. You have bounties to kill PvE bosses on different modes, and then doing certain things while in PvP.</p>
<p>Make custom bosses (could be minigames), and when beating those minigames (within a certain time frame or difficulty), your rewards will vary, but you have a higher chance of getting something rewarding from completing the minigame. Within those minigames, you can make “bounties” to complete by doing minigames a certain way. It can give exp incentives, or item incentives (or both) depending on the level of difficulty, and the time it took to complete it.</p>
<p>For PvP, you guys should make it so that the ONLY way to complete PvP bounties is if you’re in a clan (this is where you implement clan capes). To enter a clan, the clan leader should be able to create a quest to get INTO the clan (could be whatever they want…for example, kill black dragon 5 times). Once in the clan, you’re enabled to complete PvP bounties, but can ONLY complete the bounties when wearing your respective clan cape.</p>
<p>Bounties for PvP could include killing “opposing clan” members in different ways. You can kill enemies by getting the kill through range, or kill clan leader, killing all enemy clan members once, etc.</p>
<p>The bounties can reset daily, and then you can have WEEKLY bounties to complete. You can make various bounties, but cycle them and don’t have the same ones active, every day. Cycle the quests to switch it up.</p>
<p>Also, when completing raids, or especially difficult mini games, you guys could make it that you can upgrade your armor or weapons through items that enable you to upgrade your armor and weapons. In destiny, they’re called ascent shards (or something like that)…maybe you can create a rainbow shaded bead (modeled after the ones you get from killing imps), and when used against armor, or a weapon, you can +1 that equipment (ONLY ONCE) of a state you choose, or add 1 more additional hit when in combat (happens at random), or range slightly faster than normal if you upgrade a bow. For instance, if I get the rainbow bead (should be named something else), I can add +1 permanent strength to my chest plate, or add +1 defense to my plate. For other bonuses, inside combat, you have a random chance of hitting 1 more time within those 3 rounds (after hitting once, you can hit another time (rare chance) so instead of 3 hits, you have a chance of hitting 4 times. Also, when you get pked, just like regular items, you have a chance of losing that item, and whoever loots it and is able to use it, can use the bonus. For range, you can range slightly faster, or have a higher chance than normal of hitting critically (higher chance of hitting your highest hit with range). I could come up with more ideas if you guys would like.</p>
<p>Between stat bonuses, and other (more rewarding) bonuses, you can adjust the amount of rainbow beads needed to receive low tier, mid tier, or top tier bonuses for that item, and receive them at random (cannot personally select the bonus you wish to have). For instance, a stat bonus (depending on the stat) can require 1 rainbow bead, or two. Since attack and strength are slightly more important than defense, you can require defense and hp to just need 1 bead, and 2 beads for str or attk (but it will select attack or str randomly). For top tier stuff like random 4th hit, or ranging slightly quicker, you can make it so that you need 3-5 beads (respectively) to select bonuses within their respective tiers.</p>
<p>Also, make it so that you can ONLY receive these beads through weekly bounties, or raids (which would need to be extremely difficult…like spawning 3-5 black dragons on an island and having to kill them within 20 minutes), and THEN you MAY have a chance to receive the bead.</p>
<p>I could see this getting abused down the line, so I guess there needs to be road blocks to prevent that. It was just an idea.</p>
<p>Basically, make an rsc that models Destiny. As I think about it, I really think it could work. Raids in rsc could be real fun if done right.</p>
<p>If anyone is confused, I can try to explain even further (if you seriously want to try this idea out). It really could work, but would require a legit coder.</p>
