    <title>RS2 template for your website</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs2-template-for-your-website/4277</link>
    <description>My friends wanted the runescape template so I thought maby you guys would to. 

On here you can get the Runescape Homepage which you can preview here http://www.geocities.com/football2261/runescape.html , the Runescape High or low detail select preview it here http://www.geocities.com/football2261/highorlow.html , and you can get the world select preview it here http://www.geocities.com/football2261/worlds.html .

None of the links work on these sites but if you edit them to linnk to other parts of your website you could make your site exactly like runescape or make a cooll runescape site.

If you would like me 2 put anymore pages of runescape on here just tell me and I will put them right up.
