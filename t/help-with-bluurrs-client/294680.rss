    <title>Help with Bluurr&#39;s Client!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-bluurrs-client/294680</link>
    <description>Okay, so everytime when I log in to my server which is hosted by a friend of mines. I put the IP in and I logged in. But when I log in, it only lasts for 1 second and it logs out by itself. When I try to log in again, it says Your account is already logged in, please wait for 60 seconds and try again. 

But when I use Galkon&#39;s client, it works. I tried to change client because Galkon&#39;s client couldn&#39;t add more custom crowns more than 2.

Someone please help me! My Msn is Srhicecube@hotmail.com and I have Teamviewer too.</description>
