    <title>How to make skull go away in safe zones</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-skull-go-away-in-safe-zones/168931</link>
    <description>Hey, I was wondering how to make it so when I&#39;m in a safe zone, my screen is completly empty and when I&#39;m in the wildy to have the little skull with a red Wild under it. I can&#39;t seem to get it, the skull will still be there in a safe zone, but the text won&#39;t. Help please.</description>
