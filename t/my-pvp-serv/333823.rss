    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-pvp-serv/333823</link>
    <description>This is my latest development, My other developments were all on scythe, and etc.
After helping Brent code obpk, I started coding hard.
I quit coding for a while due to rsps&#39;s started to give me headache&#39;s and i thought were to hard to mantain, After a year and a half, i started (Now) And ive been coding a barrage KO Source, from reg to what it is now.
I have added new shops, WAY different and better stuff then the others.
Edited the mage guy, so he has infinity etc.
Changed the home to varrock, lookin great to.
already got 150+ players on constantly from 4 days of a server.
Updated the fairy, added ags bgs zgs sgs all working with stances, with correct str bonus&#39;s etc. Made a staff ring, made a donator cape/Superman cape (NEVER SEEN BEFORE SUPERMAN CAPE!!!!!) And puttin it together, makin it look better, when i release, you guys will be all over it watch it (: The superman cape is very different but cool looking the cape itself is black, with blue trim, And a s in the middle, added ALL HD to the server, and its a 317, And still can use silab on it and see nearly everything (:
tell me what you think please, and thankyou.
