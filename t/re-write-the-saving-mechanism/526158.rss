<p>The serialized is good, why do you want to change it? If you want to edit char files you could program an app for it or do it within the server and like use commands or something if you want.</p>

make it write to a fudgeing text document? it seriously isn’t hard. but you should leave it how it is, much more efficient</p>
<p>edit: after reading through your former post I’ve noticed every single one of them to have been in either: client help, server help, or server downloads. your intentions are clear; you do not want to learn java. you want to be spoon-fed. we don’t mind helping people with legitimate problems, but your just wanting your ass wiped for you. that was my rant for the day I suppose. but all in all, instead of coming to us with EVERY SINGLE error, make an attempt to actually learn something along the way, your not doing yourself any good mate<br>
