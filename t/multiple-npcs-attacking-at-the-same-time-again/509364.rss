    <title>Multiple NPC&#39;s attacking at the same time: AGAIN</title>

    <description>Hey reader

I currently have a little problem finding out what causes my problem. I have a few NPC&#39;s spawned by a minigame and they all load well and they do want to attack me, but once there is 1 of them attacking me, they all stop walking towards me in order to attack me. Even if I run past them, they won&#39;t do anything. I know it&#39;s probably in NPCHandler (maybe even in the void AttackPlayer method).</description>

              <p>Update on this:<br>
I managed to get them walking towards me even though I get attacked by any other NPC. Now they will attack me once the first one has died.</p>
<p>Example on this:</p>
<p>I have the 6 barrows brothers spawned at the same time on the start of my minigame. Dharok is closest to me and starts attacking me. The other brothers walk towards me to a place they can attack me. They will not attack me until I killed Dharok, not even if I attack them.</p>
