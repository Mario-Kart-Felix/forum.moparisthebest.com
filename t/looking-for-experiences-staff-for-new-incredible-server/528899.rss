    <description>Hi, my name is Petter. I&#39;ve been working with Runescape private servers for little more then a year now until the other developer took the server and abanded us.

I am looking for Staff members and developers for my new 474 based server

Little info:

- Economy -
- PK -
- Minigames -
- Fulle working skills -
- Name: P**** of Ve*******. (Hidden so people won&#39;t take it -
- Not yet released.
- I do not take in people under the age of 13 -



If you are intrested in becoming a part of this Hopefully incredible server apply like this:

Name: Petter
Age: 16
Skype name: Petterissupercool
Previous experience: I hosted my own server for about a year before I quit.
Rate yourself: 8/10
Anything else?: I enjoy coding 474 because of the perfect graphics and the memories it gives me from back when I played Runescape</description>
