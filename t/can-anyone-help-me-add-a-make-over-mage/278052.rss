    <title>Can anyone help me add a make-over mage?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-anyone-help-me-add-a-make-over-mage/278052</link>
    <description>I really want to add a Make-Over Mage to change the looks of all characters etc like the real Runescape one.

Anybody know the code or anything that could help me? :)

I know that you can force the player model looks in the config stuff but i&#39;d like a mage to change them. If i spawn the make over mage you cannot talk to him.

Thanks alot :D</description>
