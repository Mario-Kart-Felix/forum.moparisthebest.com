    <title>Adobe&#39;s First ~back to designing~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adobes-first-back-to-designing/524183</link>
    <description>Hey Moparscape, I used to be a bit active on these forums in the server help back in 2011. But got busy, and eventually grew away from it. Now that I stumbled upon it once again, I decided I&#39;d rejoin. This is the most inactive part of these forums as I have noticed and saw other people noticing so I&#39;ll start trying to head into this type of thing.
Constructive criticism would be delighted, just try not to flame, as I couldn&#39;t care less if you did.

<p>I’ll be completely honest, I started this off just trying out a lot of brushes I had just downloaded. Then I thought, it doesn’t look nearly as bad as most people’s so I’ll just turn it into a signature. Not a lot of effort put into it, but thanks for the CnC.</p>

              <p>Looks pretty good. Could use some work. Like your depth could definitely use some defining. I honestly don’t even see any depth in it at all. I suggest making your background slightly blurred to at least provide us somewhat of a focal point. The text you added doesn’t fit in well with the whole image. The background is completely white, and that never looks really good. Your lighting could use some work, although it does fit pretty well. The splashes of red effects in the top left corner looks odd to me. The render also looks pretty big. Could use some touching up, but you’re off to a good start.</p>
