    <title>MY topic locked for NO reason?!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-topic-locked-for-no-reason/56926</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
I put up my topic in the downloads section including my new harmscape source for everyone to download!
Now its been locked for no exact reason!
I was posting something to a guy called kill bill because he asked me about MY server source(harmscape) and didnt know how to start it. Now whats wrong about doing that in my thread which I made? I think i earn some respect for what I made public... Of course there i better sources, but to lock someones hard work for a reason that I cant understand? 
Maybe someone (including you mod tharaok!!!) could explain me this!!
THanks!</description>
