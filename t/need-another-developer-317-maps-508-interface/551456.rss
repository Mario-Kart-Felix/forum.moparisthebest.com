    <description>hello i have 1 developer now but we need another as he cant do everything at once etc... the donations of the server will be split between both of yall!!!  there really isnt to much to do atm just a few minor things like barrows is about 85% atm needs to be finished as he is working on client and forums! let me know on skype,thanks austin feagle

Requirements:

- You must be good with Server Sided development (aka have decent knowledge on coding a 317), I am not worried if you lack in knowledge to do with Client Side, It&#39;s perfectly fine.
- You must take this SERIOUSLY, I am not here to fool around. I take professionalism seriously, If you want to be apart of the team, then you will be 100% DEDICATED to the Server and act professional (I&#39;m not saying that we won&#39;t have fun and mess around, but on the most part you need to show professionalism). 
- You must be willing to help whenever you are asked, unless you&#39;re occupied with soemthing more important.
- You must have skype. 
- You must be able to work with a team, be friend, nice, active, professional, and be able to accept &amp; improve on constructive criticism.

You can contact me here or my skype (austin feagle), I would prefer skype.

Thanks.</description>
