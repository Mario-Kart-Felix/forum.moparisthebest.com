    <title>Help with Port Forwarding? (Pics)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-port-forwarding-pics/324709</link>
    <description>Ok so I have finished making my server and I cant log into it and neither can others and im pretty sure that its because I probably messed up on Portforwarding. (I have a D-link model DI-524 router). Ok so when im doing the portforwarding here is the pic of what I put in on my router: 

When I&#39;m putting in the portforwarding this is what it looks like:

Now when I&#39;m done with the Portforwarding I start up the server and it looks like this: (All looks good right?)
