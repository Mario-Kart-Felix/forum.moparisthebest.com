              <p>i thought i got the point across but sorry if i didn’t =\ (now looking back on my post i completely forgot to give any explanation whatsoever). this was supposed to be more of a time saver than anything else. I’m perfectly capable of finding these, but it’ll take time and i have very little time left till school starts and i have a boatload of other stuff that needs to be done. Yes, it sounds like one of those “cry me a river, you procrastinated” kind of stories, but i moved and as everyone does… procrastinated the first month but otherwise I’ve been busy between moving and funerals this summer.</p>
<p>I understand your frustration, but… it was still unnecessary lol</p>
