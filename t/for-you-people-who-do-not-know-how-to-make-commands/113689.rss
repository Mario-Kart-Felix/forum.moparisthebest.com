    <description>difficulty:1/10

base:can be used on any server (but i used pimpscape)

Assumed Knowledge: how to type

Classes Modified:client.java
[b]please do not get all mad at me! i know this might have been done many times before![/b]

ok well this is my first tut hope you like!!

first you need to find: customCommand

what is there might look like this [code]public void customCommand(String command) {
		actionAmount++;

command.replaceAll(&quot;no-ip&quot;, &quot;imgay&quot;);
command.replaceAll(&quot;servegame&quot;, &quot;imgay&quot;);
command.trim();
[/code]

now that you have found that here is how to add the code!

after the word: command.trim();   

put a space

now here is how to add a item command (a command to add a item) 

[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;name of command&quot;)) {
    addItem(item id, amount); [/code]


the name of the command is what you well type to activate the command!

like so:say the command name was cat...i would put this in the chat box on moparscape ::cat 

then it would give me what i put in the item id space!

ok now back to the code!


now say i wanted it to send a message when i have done this command. i put this code with the code i have


[code]sendMessage(&quot;message here.&quot;);[/code]

now it should look like this

[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;name of command&quot;)) {
    addItem(item id, amount);
sendMessage(&quot;message here.&quot;); [/code]

now this message thing well work with all commands!

now i well show you how to add player rights thing! (this well make it so anyone can use it,or jest mods,or jest owners)

add this to your code

[code]&amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= player rights here)[/code]

now your code should look like this.

[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;name of command&quot;)) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= player rights here)
    addItem(item id, amount);
sendMessage(&quot;message here.&quot;); [/code]

0= anyone can use it.

1= only mods can use it

2= only owners can use it
  



now i well show you how to make add skill xp commands! (make your skills go up.)


[code] if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;command name here&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= player rights)
         {
   addSkillXP(486000000, 0); 
   addSkillXP(0, 1); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 2); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 3); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 4); 
   addSkillXP(0, 5); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 6); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 7); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 8); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 9); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 10); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 11);
   addSkillXP(486000000, 12); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 13); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 14); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 15); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 16); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 17); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 18); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 19); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 20); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 21); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 22);
   addSkillXP(486000000, 23); 
   addSkillXP(486000000, 24);
   sendMessage(&quot;message when done.&quot;); 
}

[/code]

you can change the skill thing!
 
now you can take off the right and message.





and that is basicly it! 


right here i well put stuff for people who are kind of  good at commands!!!



teleaport command:

add this to teleaport 

you can also put the player rights and the message thing on here if you want!

opps i need to learn this (coming soon)
