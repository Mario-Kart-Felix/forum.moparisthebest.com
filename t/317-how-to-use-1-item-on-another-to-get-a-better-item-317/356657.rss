    <description>Hey guys! My 1st post got messed up because I put it in the wrong section. But this time I&#39;m going to be showing you how to do this with everything. This is very simple and I&#39;m a beginner so please don&#39;t get angry at me! And please, if someone already released the exact thing as I did please don&#39;t go crazy at me! I did this with my Co-Owner!

Server Tested On = Delta &amp; Devolution
Difficulty = 1/10
Credits = Me and JJ (a Co-Owner from my server)
 
OK. So here&#39;s a quick description of this TuT. I&#39;m going to teach you how to use 1 item on another to get 1 good item. For example: Dragon Sq Shield, Potions, Dragonfire Shield, ect. For this TuT I&#39;m going to use the Dragon Sq Shield for the example.

Step 1:
OK, 1st we&#39;re going to need to get 3 item ID&#39;s. The item to use, the item to be used with and the final product. The we are going to open up a blank notepad doc and put this:

if(itemUsed == #### &amp;&amp; useWith == %%%%) {
        deleteItem(####, getItemSlot(####), 1);
        deleteItem(%%%%, getItemSlot(%%%%), 1);
        addItem(@@@@, 1);
} else {
sM(&quot;message here&quot;);
}
OK. Now I&#39;m going to explain each line. 
Line 1: if(itemUsed == #### &amp;&amp; useWith == %%%%) {. All thats saying is that if you use 1 item on the other something will happen. In the #### you will put the item ID of the item you want the player to use and in the %%%% you will put the ID of the one that you will use the 1st item on. Simple enough? 


Line 2: deleteItem(####, getItemSlot(####), 1);. All you are doing in this line is putting your 1st item ID. This will remove that part from the players inventory.

Line 3: deleteItem(%%%%, getItemSlot(%%%%), 1);. This line is almost like the line before this one, but your putting the 2nd ID in. It will do the exact same thing as the line before.

Line 4: addItem(@@@@, 1);. All this line is doing is adding the the final product of using those 2 items together. The one at the end is how many the player is going to receive.

Line 5, 6, &amp; 7: } else {
sM(&quot;message here&quot;);
}. This code is just saying that if you dont have both parts to this it will say the message you choose to send. The } at the end is just telling it that the command is done.

That&#39;s the basic script. Now, Im also going to teach you how to make it have a skill requirement and so that it gives you XP. So lets just say that your making a D Sq and you want the people to have a smithing level of, lets say 90. Under the 1st line you would put this:

if (playerLevel[13] &gt;= 90) {

What that lines saying is that you need to have 90 smithing. The [13] is the skill number and the 90 at the end is the level your player needs. Now for adding XP. Lets say, you want your player to get 1,000,000m XP. Add this below the line you added above:

addSkillXP(1000000, 13);

Thats saying that your adding 1000000 XP to smithing which is skill # 13. Now if you did that, make sure you put this in the place where you should put your message! 
sM(&quot;You need to have 90 smithing to do this!&quot;);

After your done that open up your client.java, do ctrl + f and search for: case 53. When you find it go under the 1st thing that looks similar to yours and do ctrl + v. Save then Close and then compile. Then your done! If you have any questions or errors, post them below or send me a PM.</description>

              <p>This promotes horrible programming habits, and on top of this… It’s not a tutorial. There is a ton missing. What if a member doesn’t have the following:</p>
<p>addSkillXP<br>
itemUsed<br>
useWith<br>
etc.</p>
<p>Every server is different, so you can’t expect all of the variables to be the same. You have to teach it universally, so that it will work for all server sources.</p>
