    <title>Should I repair this bike?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-i-repair-this-bike/423538</link>
    <description>My dad bought this years ago for $5 at a garage sale. Although it&#39;s very old, the bike is one of the more expensive brands here in Australia. I don&#39;t need a bike, neither will I ride it very often but I have a lot of free time on my hands these days.

All I would need is something to remove the rust, lubricant for the chain, new tires and a helmet. 

That would cost me under $30, depending on how much helmets go for. Is it worth it?</description>

<p>We have gasoline powered bicycles too, but not many people use them. The electric motor assists you, it doesn’t work when you aren’t moving the pedals. It’s like riding your bike with a constant wind in your back. The reason they don’t buy petrol engines isn’t clear to me. I wouldn’t buy a petrol engine for my bike, because you look like a hobo if you do, but I wouldn’t be an E-bike either.</p>
<p>I guess any of the following reasons apply: The bike doesn’t look bad, usage is cheaper than a petrol engine, it doesn’t pollute on the spot (generating electricity pollutes, but I’d rather have a power plant <span class="bbcode-b">outside</span> of a city than lots of petrol engines <span class="bbcode-b">in</span> a city) and it doesn’t smell.</p>

You don’t get it, do you? The dutchies are obsessed with saving the environment. Putting a petrol engine on a bike would defeat the purpose.</p>

<p>Obviously a new bike costs more than a used bike. Racing bikes that cost more than €1000,- have carbon components, which make them lighter. Obviously, the more expensive racing bikes have more expensive components, which ensure a smoother and faster ride.</p>
<p>E-bikes are expensive because of the motor and battery. Normal bicycles aren’t that expensive, and you could do with a cheap one. My normal bicycle put me back €150,- which isn’t that much.</p>

              <p>This ‘chain wax/lube’ stuff they are talking about may be good to lubricate it over the long-run, I don’t know, I’ve never used it.

I can’t believe anyone would spend that much on a bicycle unless they were a hard-core racer or something!  The most I’ve ever spent on a bike is $100 (on sale from $250), but most of my bikes when I was younger were just bought used for $5-$15, and they all worked just fine. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p>Like Radeon said, we Europeans (and especially the Dutch and Belgians) have a rich bicycle culture. I used my bike to go to elementary school, secondary school, and still to go to the busstop now that I go to higher education. Although public transport is mostly used by students, it isn’t like in the US where schools pick children up with a bus.</p>
<p>My household, consisting of my parents and myself, own a total of 7 bicycles. I have 2 racing bicycles and a normal bicycle. My father has 2 MTB’s, and my mother has two normal bicycles. The racers and the MTB’s are shared between me and my father. Our bicycle to household members ratio is quite high, even to Dutch standards, but almost every Dutch citizen owns at least one bicycle. The newest trend is the electrical bicycle, where a motor assists you. They cost well in excess of €1000,- Popular ones reach €2000,-[/quote]<br>

<p>I really don’t think that amount of surface rust will cause a problem, and probably a good soaking with WD40 and a few rides will wear it right off anyhow.</p>
<p>I can’t believe anyone would spend that much on a bicycle unless they were a hard-core racer or something!  The most I’ve ever spent on a bike is $100 (on sale from $250), but most of my bikes when I was younger were just bought used for $5-$15, and they all worked just fine. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>What will you be using it for (school/job, or racing)?

<p>Clean the cassette and chain, and take it for a spin. Maybe just removing the rust will suffice.</p>
<p>You won’t need more than 9 gears. On flat terrain, only gears 3-9 come in use. 8 and 9 probably require you to switch gears on the crankset first, which only happens when you go faster than about 30km/h.</p>
<p>The bike doesn’t look like it’s been used for racing though. When racing, you put slicks on your bike, not tires with profile. You put a saddle on it that will make you sterile if you sit on it too long, and pedals that give more grip.</p>

<p>You don’t need to remove the rust to ride it, and if the tires and tubes will hold air, you don’t need to replace them either, and if they won’t hold air, you can also just put a $5 tube inside them if the tread is sufficient for your needs.  All that chain/gear setup needs is a few sprays with a penetrating oil like WD-40, that you can get a generic version of from the dollar store around here for less than $3.

<p>Yeah that sums it up. Gonna go get me some WD40 and I’ll settle with any other imperfections.</p>

              <p>I wouldn’t replace the gears as that would drive the cost up enough not to make it worth restoring.</p>

<p>Depends on condition of crank set and pedal arms, also wear on chain, HF with the rear freewheel (under 9 gears?) that looks fucked.</p>

<p>Why would you need more than 9 gears? confused face/</p>
<p>Just like RSC said, not wearing a helmet is dangerous. Also the police here will fine you for not wearing one.</p>

              <p>Just put a bit of steam oil on the chain and ride around for a while. That will fix the chain. All you really need on a bike like that is working brakes. If the tires aint popped, don’t fix em.</p>
