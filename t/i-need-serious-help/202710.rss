    <description>Ok, I am new to making private servers and I am having some problems.

First of all, when people talk about client.java, in my source folder (Czar) i dont have client.java, but I do have client and client.class. So when people say to edit client.java, i edit client. Now, I am not sure wether that is the problem but whenever I change anything in any folder wether it be client(.java) or server(.java) it does not change anything at all. I save it, compile and restart the server, and when I log in again, everything is still the same.

Please help me</description>

<p>if you did then: there will be a client.class and just Client(in a like a txt format)for somepeople</p>
<p>if your not: Try redownloading the client if it doesnt work just try a new source</p>
