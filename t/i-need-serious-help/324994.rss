    <title>I need serious help! =(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-serious-help/324994</link>
    <description>So for Christmas I got a laptop with Windows 7 Home Premium. The wireless internet sometimes randomly dc&#39;s and when I try and reconnect it says &quot;Unable to connect to [network name]&quot;. Half the programs on my laptop that I&#39;ve downloaded don&#39;t work because of my gay firewall. My firewall is screwed up big time! I&#39;ve tried playing runescape and I get redirected to http://world17.runescape.com/error_game_js5connect.ws because my firewall or something is blocking off port 43594. I made an exception in my firewall (In the inbound connections section) for port 43594 but it still gets blocked. I&#39;ve tried downloading Trend Micro and House Call to scan for viruses but they can&#39;t be installed because &quot;I&#39;m not connected to the internet&quot;. I&#39;ve tried opening Firefox, Safari, Netscape, Google Chrome, and Flock, but all of those so that they can&#39;t display the webpage and that I&#39;m not connected to the internet. One program said I was having troubles with my proxy settings but I don&#39;t have a proxy set up! So these are 2 things I&#39;m having serious troubles with:
My firewall.
My internet connection.
Please help! I&#39;m posting for help here because I know there are LOTS of 1337 computer wiz&#39;s here that can help. How do you think I should fix my problems I&#39;ve been having? Oh, by the way, I&#39;ve tried shutting off my firewall but that did nothing.</description>

<p>try completely disabling the firewall and if it still does not work, it is not your firewall blocking everything, it is something else</p>

I couldn’t find anything useful, although I looked at my Wireless Connection properties, and neither IPv4 or IPv6 are Installed. Could this be a problem?</p>

<p>If you shut off your firewall, then what makes you so sure it’s your firewall blocking stuff? Even so, add software exceptions to your firewall (I’ve never used a Windows Vista or 7 one, so don’t ask me how) like you would on XP, if it’s even possible. Instead of using the default Windows 7 network manager, download some other one, or if you bought a wireless network adapter, use the software that came with it if it came with any. If you ARE using the software it came with, then try Windows 7’s. That’s all I can think of at the top of my head.</p>

<p>I’m using the built-in network adapter and I’m currently also connected to the local area connection of my family computer. I’ll do some looking around in the devices area of my computer. Sometimes I use a Linksys adapter that I didn’t install. I used it a few years ago with my old vista computer and had installed it but I lost the CD and am able to plug in the adapter and connect wirelessly without a problem. I’ll get back to you if I can find any other problems/solutions<br>
(One day later)<br>
I can’t find any problems, but I’m not going to go get it checked out because I’m saving up for… Well I don’t know, but I don’t want to waste a bunch of money for nothing. Thanks for trying to help Lin.</p>
