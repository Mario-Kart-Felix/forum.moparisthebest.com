    <title>How illiterate were you?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-illiterate-were-you/525806</link>
    <description>I was going over some old posts I have made on all the websites I have contributed to and have realised I was illiterate as fook, check this out for example:

              <p>I like you Lin.</p>
<p>I have near-perfect grammar, however I’ve always had one question. When you’re trying to say the plural of something which cannot be typed as it is mainly phonetic (like the plural of s, ss? s’s?), how is it typed?</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>ANSWER!:</p>
<blockquote>Apostrophes are used to form plurals of letters that appear in lowercase; here the rule appears to be more typographical than grammatical, e.g. "three ps" versus "three p's." To form the plural of a lowercase letter, place 's after the letter. There is no need for apostrophes indicating a plural on capitalized letters, numbers, and symbols (though keep in mind that some editors, teachers, and professors still prefer them). Here are some examples:
[b]p's and q's[/b]
[b]Ps and Qs[/b]</blockquote>

<p>’</p>
<p>Amazing isn’t it? Now, these are its TWO, AND ONLY TWO PURPOSES (As I know of):</p>
<p>-To show ownership (Lin’s something)<br>
-To take place of removed characters (Don’t)</p>
<p>Here’s an example of where you <span class="bbcode-b">shouldn’t</span> (Hey look, a proper apostrophe!) use one:<br>
“Array’s”<br>
I saw that in the tutorial section. Why? Why is it there? There’s no ownership being given to it, and no letters missing from the original word. <span class="bbcode-b">It’s not needed. It’s annoying and improper grammar.</span> Using no apostrophes is better than using one where they’re not needed.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Good</span><br>
The building’s windows are clean.<br>
Don’t do that, please.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Bad</span><br>
A Lesson on Apostrophe’s</p>
<p>The sad thing is I need to post this, when you were learned about them in the 1st Grade for all you Amerikanz. It’s rare for me to post two topics in around an hour in the same board, but I seriously got angry when constantly seeing it.</p>
<p>But seriously. Stop adding apostrophes when not supposed to. It makes you look like an idiot.</p>

When it’s supposed to be like ver samila tuude. How silly I had a good laugh.<br>
Why I remember the other day I tried to read othello but it was sad at some parts that I felt lugubrious. Man that was silly &lt;— I’m such a funny person haha.<br>

some weapons i have recently added do not fit the player’s hand in my client. for example, they would just stay there, and when the player attacks an npc, they would just punch it barehanded, with the weapon staying still right beside them. how do i fix this?</p>

<p>I wasn’t trying to be literate. I don’t get you plan to go with this thread<br>
In case you didn’t notice some of the english grammar cases i was trying to make abit noticeable was<br>
you and one, breaking up my dependent clauses etc.</p>
<p>but what are you trying to showcase here? that you are super literate now?<br>
This is why I hate grammar Nazis<br>
I like funny and false grammar. There is no point to correct improper grammar in non formal posts such as forum posts.<br>
It’s fine to tell them that but using it as a way to show your superiority is pure ignorance.<br>
It is very annoying. It goes something like this<br>
“your stupid and week” and the Nazi has nothing to say<br>
and does “you’re* weak*” then screenshots it and posts it on Reddit or Facebook thinking that the comeback was freaking hilarious<br>
It is stupid. It isn’t cool either. that is why i hate these posts or threads.<br>
Especially when you know the person already knows he accidentally mistyped because of a little rush.<br>
I mean YOU know what they freaking mean.<br>
… but i guess it makes them feel good about themselves.</p>
