    <title>Australian hosted RSPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/australian-hosted-rsps/541871</link>
    <description>Is anyone aware of an RSPS hosted in Australia? I was playing a server trying to hybrid when I realized I can&#39;t play American servers without wanting to kill myself..

Doesn&#39;t have to be just in Australia btw, can be in the oceania region- eg new zealand maybe japan etc.
