    <title>Got a Problem with a Blank Source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/got-a-problem-with-a-blank-source/296294</link>
    <description>So.. I have decided to start completely new, with a blank source.
So far, the home is great, and added a few NPCs.

But...

I want too add a Scimitar shop near the NPCs so that players can buy, as they advance levels.
But when I use the Shopmaker, I look in client.java and I don&#39;t have a &quot;Wannashop = 2&quot;
And I have no clue how I would start one without messing up the server.

If anyone has ideas, that would be great.
Thanks! :rolleyes:</description>
