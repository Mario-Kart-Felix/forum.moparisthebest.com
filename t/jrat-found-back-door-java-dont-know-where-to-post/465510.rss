    <title>JRAT found back-door java.(Don&#39;t know where to post)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jrat-found-back-door-java-dont-know-where-to-post/465510</link>
    <description>My pc has caught a JRAT about an hour ago by downloading one of the &quot;clients&quot; on the server status page.
I&#39;m not familiar with these kind of things, but it seems to be a java back-door application which can break into your computer.
I suggest this server to be removed from the serverstatus page.

^ That is the link with the JRAT.

Please correct me when I&#39;m wrong. I appreciate your comments and I want to learn of them.</description>
