    <title>Can&#39;t Connect to Anything!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-connect-to-anything/10545</link>
    <description>I have tried the MoparScape 3.0 Client by going &quot;File &gt; New Server&quot; and entering the exact IP of the server I want to use. I then hit &quot;Enter&quot; and then I type my user and pass and hit &quot;Login&quot;. It NEVER works!

I&#39;ve tried an old, basic client which is just &quot;Username:&quot; and &quot;Server:&quot; when you hit &quot;Existing User&quot;.

I CAN play on/modify the private servers which I have downloaded the source for and have run the Compile.bat and Runserver.bat files.

But I just can&#39;t seem to connect to ANY SINGLE SERVER.

I&#39;ve made sure that the people said they were online, etc etc.

Help, please? I used to be able to play on them every day, but now I can&#39;t. No matter what time, what server, what client, what IP, etc.
