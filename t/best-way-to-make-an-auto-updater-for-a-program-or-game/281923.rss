    <title>Best Way to make an Auto-Updater for a Program or Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-way-to-make-an-auto-updater-for-a-program-or-game/281923</link>
    <description>Well, there&#39;s something I&#39;m working on. It&#39;s an online multiplayer game, and is coming along good (Has logging in and account creation). However, some point I plan on adding an auto-updater. I&#39;ve done this before, but it previously looked at a file online and read the version. If the version wasn&#39;t didn&#39;t match the one in the program, an update was required. On download, it would download the new EXE... (This was a while back when I wasn&#39;t that good at programming.)

Realizing that wouldn&#39;t work for a professional game (Not saying mine is, because I know it&#39;s not. I&#39;m just saying that because I&#39;m comparing it with other games), I wanted to make it replace the current EXE file. However, I only have one idea in mind that&#39;ll make it so you wouldn&#39;t have multiple EXE files...

Do the version checking thing like previously said, and if it needs to update, close the EXE file (the main game application) and launch another program that actually downloads the update. First it would store the file name of the game application, then kill each instant of the game program and re-download the new one, rename it, and launch it. That way, nothing would have to be done manually.

The problem I see with this is the whole application will have to be re-downloaded and can be bad if the file size gets big (Which it will, unless I decide to load images from an external source and tell it to download new ones if any).

If you can think of another way, please tell me. I was thinking of a plug-in system, but honestly, I&#39;ve never had any experience with one and would like to stick with something like my idea.

Thanks,

<p>P.S. OffTopic.<br>
On that note am i the first person to make a recursive compression that can be decompressed completely? I turned a 200 MB file into 1024 bytes (1 KB) can’t go into details but is it a joke if I try to patent it or something. Wonder if there is anyone money in this? After all its very slow to compress and just as slow to decompress. Good for backing up data in the longrun.</p>
