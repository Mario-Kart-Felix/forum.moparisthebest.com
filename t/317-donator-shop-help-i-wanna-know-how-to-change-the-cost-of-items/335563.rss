    <description>well in my source, items are bought out of a shop with donator points.

in the shop for example it would say..
[code]Spirit Shield: currently costs 2 Donator points[/code]

what file, do i edit the cost of donator points for an item?</description>

              <p>To editi the file, find the item in Items.cfg<br>
And edidt the first 3 number of the item.<br>
And thats the price.<br>
What it does is, the items in the donator shop are already set to sell and buy with donator points.<br>
So anything in that shop will sell everything it has for donator points.</p>

              <p>hmm maybe it’s just like regular files-go into items.cgs and it should look something like this</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:<br>
item = 3627	Arcane_spirit_shield	An_ethereal_shield_with_an_arcane_sigil_attached_to_it.	120700000	120700000	0	0	0…</p>
<p>so the first number set you see is what the shop will buy fro-the second one is what you sell for-change that and problem solved(maybe) , just not to sure about the donater points but it changes the shop price forsure.</p>
<p>hopefuly that helped =]</p>
