    <title>How do I make a client connect to my no-ip</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-a-client-connect-to-my-no-ip/217870</link>
    <description>I recently downloaded an open client and source. I was just wondering how I could get the client to connect to my no-ip. Someone said there was a tut on here but I was unable to find it. Please help me! :) Thank you!

Edit: Scratch that. I figured it out.</description>
