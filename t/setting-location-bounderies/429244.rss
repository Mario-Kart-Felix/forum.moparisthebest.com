    <title>Setting location bounderies</title>

    <description>Alright so I have a warriors guild bug that when you leave it still takes your points until you are out, and when you run out, no matter where you are, it teleports you back to the guild.

I would like to add some sort of location check like if c.isinguild {
points drain here etc
}
else {
save points to character file here
}

Can I get some help with this?</description>
