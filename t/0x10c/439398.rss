&lt;blockquote&gt;A New Game

Hi, I&#39;m Notch, and this is my new game. It&#39;s going to be a space game, and it&#39;s quite ambitious!

The game is still extremely early in development, but like we did with Minecraft, we expect to release it early and let the players help me shape the game as it grows.

The cost of the game is still undecided, but it&#39;s likely there will be a monthly fee for joining the Multiverse as we are going to emulate all computers and physics even when players aren&#39;t logged in. Single player won&#39;t have any recurring fees.

Backstory and Setting

In a parallel universe where the space race never ended, space travel was gaining popularity amongst corporations and rich individuals.

In 1988, a brand new deep sleep cell was released, compatible with all popular 16 bit computers. Unfortunately, it used big endian, whereas the DCPU-16 specifications called for little endian. This led to a severe bug in the included drivers, causing a requested sleep of 0x0000 0000 0000 0001 years to last for 0x0001 0000 0000 0000 years.

It&#39;s now the year 281 474 976 712 644 AD, and the first lost people are starting to wake up to a universe on the brink of extinction, with all remote galaxies forever lost to red shift, star formation long since ended, and massive black holes dominating the galaxy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#39;m surprised by the lack of a thread here about it. I&#39;m actually fairly excited for this game but I think Notch went about the wrong way of releasing the game to the public because there is no direction other than the DCPU-16 and hard science fiction. Looks like a Minecraft-based space game with a onboard computer you can program. So far.</description>
