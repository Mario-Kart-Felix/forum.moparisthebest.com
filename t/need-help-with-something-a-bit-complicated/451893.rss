    <title>Need help with something a bit complicated</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-something-a-bit-complicated/451893</link>
    <description>Alright, so theres this server I play called Tribulation PK, but problem is they have no downloadable client, Just a webclient. I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a way to make the desktop client, it has something to do with the cache and crap. Does anyone have a solution/idea? 

If you want to see webclient heres the link:

http://www.trpk.net/webclient.html

p.s i&#39;ve talked to people that have done it but they won&#39;t tell me how.</description>
