<p>We are getting oil. Oil prices in the US are lower than anywhere else in the world. I agree, the Arabs control us and it’s Bush’s (and every president for the past 25+ years) fault. We could switch to other fuels (for example, Brazil has completely stopped being dependent on foreign fuels…they use some kind of corn oil), but since they cost slightly more in the short term we don’t.</p>
<p>Personally I would pay 5$ a gallon if I knew I wasn’t supporting those crazy arab fucks.</p>

<p>Let me elaborate on that. assuming your american (sorry if your not) u goto war in the middle east to pump out as much oil as possible. Then You cant wait till the day that the oil will finsh over there. Why? oh sorry did i say u went to the middle east for oil? i meant democracy silly me :s…<br>

<p>the arabs are controlling you? Thats why the middle east is a thrid world country. Many people can barely eat everyday while you guys are orried whether or not you can fill your car up with petrol to move while theres many alternatives. People in the middle east are so poor yet they are controlling the strongeest country in the world? With a debt that the US has i dont think they would be fighting to spread their beloved democracy. The only people benefiting form the oil in the mid east are the leaders and the US and other countries.<br>
We are getting oil. Oil prices in the US are lower than anywhere else in the world. I agree, the Arabs control us and it’s Bush’s (and every president for the past 25+ years) fault. We could switch to other fuels (for example, Brazil has completely stopped being dependent on foreign fuels…they use some kind of corn oil), but since they cost slightly more in the short term we don’t.</p>
<p>Personally I would pay 5$ a gallon if I knew I wasn’t supporting those crazy arab fucks.[/quote]</p>

<p>The middle east is a region, not a country.</p>
<blockquote>Many people can barely eat everyday while you guys are orried whether or not you can fill your car up with petrol to move while theres many alternatives.</blockquote>
<p>Not only do many people have trouble getting enough to eat everyday, 30,000 children starve to death every day. I would gladly use an alternative to oil if possible, and support candidates for office that want energy reform, hence I’m doing all I can as a US citizen.</p>
<blockquote>People in the middle east are so poor</blockquote>
<p>Not really. There country is rich in natural resources, they just <span class="bbcode-b">choose</span> to fight eachother, as they have for <span class="bbcode-b">thousands of years</span> and will continue to do <span class="bbcode-b">for thousands more</span>.</p>
<blockquote>yet they are controlling the strongeest country in the world? With a debt that the US has i dont think they would be fighting to spread their beloved democracy.</blockquote>
<p>Our countries fiscal situation can be quickly reversed. During Clintons presidency, we were asking “What are we going to do with the surplus?”. Besides, it doesn’t make a difference whether we have money or not, we can always just print some more out of the national mint; it’s not backed up by gold anymore. Hence, any debt we have is imaginary anyway.</p>
<blockquote>The only people benefiting form the oil in the mid east are the leaders and the US and other countries.</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, all the Arabs you see driving around in Rolls Royces and shooting their collecters edition Benelli shotgun in the air earned all their money some other way than oil. Probably high alching sand.</p>

Do you think sunnis and shiates would be fighting each other if the US did not invade iraq?
The country is rich in natural resources which are mostly exported. 40% of the profit goes to a royal family or leader while the rest of the money goes to the government which is barely enough to support the people
