        <p>Gah heres my two cents i couldnt be bothered reading half the crap on the other pages so if i repeat some stuff sorry.</p>
<p>The nuclear warheads today are 50 times more powerful then the ones used on japan. And no im not exaggerating they are actually 50 times better. By the time one person launches a missile the other will launch cause they will see it comeing and it will be all over. Its the M.A.D theory. Or is it M.A.S. I think its mad. Anyways it stands for mutually assured destruction. That means that as soon as ONE missile is fired everyone goes ape and starts firing theres even at allies.</p>
<p>This is because if say russia shoots one at someone. (this is never going to happen but just say) and to get to that place it ahzs to go over america. They will say to america hey were firing this thign dont shoot at us cause it will only pass over you not land at you. America will immediatly think is it true or not. Because if there lieign there dead. And if there tellign the truth and they shoot it down russia will get pissed off.</p>
<p>And on the execution thing. Its better for him to rot in solitary confinement. He will never see another human face that isnt a guard or jail warden. He is in his cell 23 hours a day. And the other 1 hour he is in a room with concrete walla where he has time to excersise.  If he was executioned he would be a martyr and he would like that cause then he would go striaght to heaven</p>

        <p>Oh yeah I read about this on Yahoo News. The guy that was convicted, at the end of the trial, said “You lost America, I won” or something like that. What a wacko. But then again… America was the one that created Osama Bin Laden during the war with Russia. So… maybe we deserved what we got? We created them, and left them to continue teaching hate, and then those suicide bomber Gihadis (Gee-Ha-Deez) came to India and lots of other people killing 10s of 1000s of people.</p>

<li>
<p>Xerxes is a DA and no i am not kidding. Anyone who has been to the SRL forum will agree with me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If 70% truly hate france well heres one reason:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>The French lost WW II to the Germans in about 20 minutes. Along with the British, we got into the war and had about 150,000 guys killed getting their country back for them. We fought all across France, and the Germans finally surrendered in a French schoolhouse. 
<p>You’d think that school building in Reims would be a great tourist attraction but it isn’t. The French seem embarrassed by it. They don’t want to call attention to the fact that we freed them from German occupation.</p>
<p>I heard Steven Spielberg say the French wouldn’t even let him film the D-Day scenes in â€œSaving Private Ryanâ€ on the Normandy beaches. They want people to forget the price we paid getting their country back for them.</p>

All the people who make those conspiracy videos are just Liberal Extremeists who want to bring the president down. You may remember me from ArLTD when they had the 9/11 conspiracy thread. I was the person who came up with about 18 reasons to prove the video wrong…</p>

<p>w00t one supporter, and wow my oppinnion obviously turned half the forum against me more than half prob lol i dont care. i dont take sides i just say what i think will happen. As for the french jokes come on man you dont think i havent heard that? theres this kid as school spends he entire time finding french jokes and comes up to me and starts “dissing me” as he calles it. I know 75 % of the us hates france. So be it, make sure you remeber 50 of that 75 are rednecks in trailers  ;)[/quote]</p>

<p>Xerxes is a DA and no i am not kidding. Anyone who has been to the SRL forum will agree with me</p>

<p>If 70% truly hate france well heres one reason:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[quote]<br>
The French lost WW II to the Germans in about 20 minutes. Along with the British, we got into the war and had about 150,000 guys killed getting their country back for them. We fought all across France, and the Germans finally surrendered in a French schoolhouse.</p>
<p>You’d think that school building in Reims would be a great tourist attraction but it isn’t. The French seem embarrassed by it. They don’t want to call attention to the fact that we freed them from German occupation.</p>
<p>I heard Steven Spielberg say the French wouldn’t even let him film the D-Day scenes in â€œSaving Private Ryanâ€ on the Normandy beaches. They want people to forget the price we paid getting their country back for them. [/quote]</p>

For all you dumb shits you think the U.S government was behind 9/11, you really need to stop looking at Google Videos.

I was the person who came up with about 18 reasons to prove the video wrong…</p>
<p>Please, just don’t believe every bloody thing you see in the internet…[/quote]</p>
<p>You are the only dumb shit here. U.S Government was behind 9/11, and I haven’t looked at Google videos, I have seen a couple videos like Loose Change (<a href="http://www.loosechange911.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.loosechange911.com/</a>). It got some interesting facts there that it wasen’t a Boeing 747 that hit Pentagon, rather a missile. See at it and then comment. I am glad to discuss this with you however with no insults alright.</p>
<p>Look at that video, and then say what you want, bring up questions and such I will do my best to try and answer. Have you ever seen the offical reasons by the government? They are a joke, I am not american and I don’t give a damn but I give a damn when USA tries to play god and attack whoever they want.</p>
<p>For example, Sherton hotel and a gas station was recording when the “Boeing 747” hit Pentagon, so why did FBI come few minutes later and grabbed those records, which never was released to public? Why is for example the Pentagon lawn completely GREEN, without a single scratch? Why do so many people say they heard explostions? Why did the owner of WTC or WTC 7 make a contract that if something happends to them he shall get money or somthing similiar.</p>
<p>Why, days and weeks later alot of training took places, and terrorist campaings.</p>
<p>Here is like a few things people wonder about;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>How did a failed Cessna pilot execute the Pentagon attack?<br>
(The guy they said flied into Pentagon, he couldn’t even fly a one-engine Cessna)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When did Flight 93 crash? Was it shot down? Do cell phones work at 30,000 feet?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many hijackings were attempted? How many flights diverted?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What caused the collapse of a third skyscraper, WTC 7, which was not hit by a plane?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the movie they show how other buildings like burn for 24 hours and it never collapsed, how could WTC, who was build so great, to stand against a plane crash and such collapse after 10 seconds?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20041221155307646" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20041221155307646</a> &lt;- Here you can find a bunch of reasons, if you really don’t think 9/11 was behind it, answer them please?.</p>
<p>Why did security guards get 12 hour shift? (if i am not wrong now), why did the bomb dogs get removed?.</p>
<p>Did you know a plan like this was written for Kennedy by some guy, so he could start a war against Kuba? But he refused the plan, and that may had been the reason for his death.</p>
<p>Bush also needed a new Pearl Harbor to be able to attack countries like Iran, Iraq, Afganhistan, Syria, Korea and who knows who else.</p>
<p>Why did when someone(can’t remember who, but in the movie you can see) say that no planes should be in the air, all the current ones in the air should land and no others could lift, but why were there still a couple planes on the air?</p>
<p>Alright, and once again. In Iraq, it’s still war, and Iraq is not a good country with a good military, but Iran, Iran is different, they have a great military and I saw on news that they had around 30,000 or 40,000 self-bombers ready.</p>

        <p>Pfft, those you want to read my many reasons and arguments againts yours, read up. Btw, Loose change is a goolge video…lmao. Oh, and of course, written and directed by ‘Alex Jones’…at the start of the video, I thought this is gonna be a load of bollucks. Examples that prove this are “Whoa, rewind this!” Comparing a very blured plane to a sharp picture. That was just the start. Anyway, to answer these idiotic accusations I am gonna do it in a special format.<br>
First, your ‘un-answerable question’ and than my answer:</p>
<p>“OMGZ! There was a pod underneath the plane!!! Its a missile/bomb!!!”</p>
<p>Answer - The most clearest shots of the 173 plane was taken by Rob Howard. This high res picture was sent to Ronald Greeley, director of the Space Photography Laboratory at Arizona State University. Greely dismissed the notion of the missile. What was visible was  the Boeing’s right fairing, a pronounced bulge that contains the landing gear. He also conluded that light reflecting off it gave it an exagerated look.</p>
<p>Claim - "No fighter jets were scrambled from any of the 28 Air Force bases within close range of the four hijacked flights. “On 11 September Andrews had two squadrons of fighter jets with the job of protecting the skies over Washington D.C.,” says the Web site <a href="http://emperors-clothes.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">emperors-clothes.com</a>. “They failed to do their job.” “There is only one explanation for this,” writes Mark R. Elsis of <a href="http://standdown.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">StandDown.net</a>. “Our Air Force was ordered to Stand Down on 9/11.”</p>
<p>Answer - On 9/11 there were only 14 fighter jets on alert in the contiguous 48 states. No computer network or alarm automatically alerted the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) of missing planes. “They [civilian Air Traffic Control, or ATC] had to pick up the phone and literally dial us,” says Maj. Douglas Martin, public affairs officer for NORAD. Boston Center, one of 22 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regional ATC facilities, called NORAD’s Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) three times: at 8:37 am EST to inform NEADS that Flight 11 was hijacked; at 9:21 am to inform the agency, mistakenly, that Flight 11 was headed for Washington (the plane had hit the North Tower 35 minutes earlier); and at 9:41 am to (erroneously) identify Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 from Boston as a possible hijacking. The New York ATC called NEADS at 9:03 am to report that United Flight 175 had been hijacked–the same time the plane slammed into the South Tower. Within minutes of that first call from Boston Center, NEADS scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air Force Base in Falmouth, Mass., and three F-16s from Langley Air National Guard Base in Hampton, Va. None of the fighters got anywhere near the pirated planes.</p>
<p>Claim - "On Sept. 11, FOX News broadcast a live phone interview with FOX employee Marc Birnbach. <a href="http://911inplanesite.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">911inplanesite.com</a> states that “Bernback” saw the plane “crash into the South Tower.” “It definitely did not look like a commercial plane,” Birnbach said on air. “I didn’t see any windows on the sides.”</p>
<p>Coupled with photographs and videos of Flight 175 that lack the resolution to show windows, Birnbach’s statement has fueled one of the most widely referenced 9/11 conspiracy theories–specifically, that the South Tower was struck by a military cargo plane or a fuel tanker."</p>
<p>Answer - Birnbach, who was a freelance videographer with FOX News at the time, tells PM that he was more than 2 miles southeast of the WTC, in Brooklyn, when he briefly saw a plane fly over. He says that, in fact, he did not see the plane strike the South Tower; he says he only heard the explosion.</p>
<p>While heading a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) probe into the collapse of the towers, W. Gene Corley studied the airplane wreckage. A licensed structural engineer with Construction Technology Laboratories, a consulting firm based in Skokie, Ill., Corley and his team photographed aircraft debris on the roof of WTC 5, including a chunk of fuselage that clearly had passenger windows. “It’s … from the United Airlines plane that hit Tower 2,” Corley states flatly. In reviewing crash footage taken by an ABC news crew, Corley was able to track the trajectory of the fragments he studied–including a section of the landing gear and part of an engine–as they tore through the South Tower, exited from the building’s north side and fell from the sky.</p>
<p>A picture of windowed debre <a href="http://imageshack.us/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img133.imageshack.us/img133/4003/0305911windowssm3na.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>Now, there are about 11 pages of answering your crap up on the site: <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/defense/1227842.html?page=3&amp;c=y" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/defense/1227842.html?page=3&amp;c=y</a></p>
<p>This proves, with evidence, that you are wrong. Alex Jones’ videos are made for brainwashing. They make you look at evidence which you cannot dispute. I used to believe that. I actually used to think that the Government killed thousands of people. I talked to my parents about it, and they almost changed my mind. I went to certain sites that debunk the idea, and after reading a few hundred pages, I was finally convinced that this theory was made for publicity.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to insult you btw. And Xerxes, you are one of the most hated people on this forum. What makes you hated is you thinking you are superior to everyone else. You know who else thinks like that? Nazis. I am not calling you a Nazi, I am saying they have the same ideas as you.</p>
<p>Now, what I expressed above is my opinion. You are entitled to your own opinion. I am just asking you to look at more harder evidence, other from Google Videos.</p>

        <p>sdcit, if you are talking to me. Yes I read all those pages. Xerxes, I could bring up a lot more points. Everything that is on Google Videos is either fake, true or complete bullshit. The category the conspiracy fulls under is the 3rd one. I don’t understand why you can’t see you havent been brainwashed. I just don’t understand it. What logic is there in killing thousands of your own people?</p>

i dont know if this has anything to do with the ^^ topic but he is right america has lost and the mid-eastearn countries have won. The u.s. debt is soo freakin high that the country will collapse in 5 years.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/</a></p>
<p>this is the current us debt</p>
<p>$8,354,235,972,701.79</p>
<p>"The estimated population of the United States is 298,646,034<br>
so each citizen’s share of this debt is $27,973.70.</p>
<p>The National Debt has continued to increase an average of<br>
$1.95 billion per day since September 30, 2005!"</p>
<p>If the U.S. went to war with Iran i have no doubt in my mind that Iran will win. They will defeat the u.s. in the nuclear war. president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will show no mercy.</p>
<p>This is not an biaist opinnion because im a from France and i am just showing the facts.</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
Hey, Buddy… Your own damn country was bankrupt after helping funding the U.S.A. in their revoluntionary battle. Did your country collapse? Nope… Btw: Before you talk crap about the U.S. think about fighting your own battles… Obvisouly, You would get your arse kicked if the U.S. wasn’t an ally…[/quote] honestly i dont think he was trying to make fun… im from the us of a as well and i agree with his, our country has suffered a VERY,( dont even get me started ) VERY!!! defishient income rate sence bush came to office… when clintin was prez, gas was $1.90 now its a frickin $3.40 were i live and is rizing by 2 cents every day… also, “buddy” he is just explaining the facts, dont get a Non-bright eyed and bushytailed becuz he states his opinion.</p>

        <p>I have no doubts Bush and his mates planned this. Yet, you came up with 2-3 points that I hardly talked about…I guess… respond to my questions, watch the film or whatever.</p>
<p>Btw, all these “US didn’t do 9/11” is made by people who like Bush. So what you say is pure bullshit. there were no fkn terrorist, how the hell could the Twin towers burn and explode just like that when it gets hit by a plane? Either it had to be bombs in the Twin towers, or it was not a plane. Maybe a missile.</p>
<p>I read about a couple buildings who was on fire for like 24 hours or more, and those buildings was older, and it didnt explode nor fall down or whatever.</p>
<p>Man, just use your brain and you will understand the truth.</p>
<p>Answer my questions, look at the movie and answer those questions and then I may believe you that US didn’t do it, kthx.</p>
<p>And the logic is very clear:<br>
All those leaders have been trained not to give a damn about the people. Atleast thats what I think.<br>
They are ready to kill thousands of people, to accomplish what their want - I have no idea why they could have done it, whoever a couple reasons: War with Iraq, Iran, Afganistan and other countries, even Bush himself said World War 3 has started. A idea like this was brought to Kennedy, and he denied it all. So, why you telling me this wouldn’t happen?</p>
<p>etc etc I could write forever but I am lazy now.</p>
<p>Answer my questions, the films questions and I may believe you.</p>
<p>And you know, a profit they get from this? Bushs family, or Dick Cheneys corporations that sells guns, or deals with oil etc.</p>

        <p>Firstly, the movies are biased. They are made by nothing more than liberal extremeists that do anything to try and bring down governments. Secondly, The site I provided you with is based around the films about all the nonsense. I can currently answer these questions:</p>
<p>Your question -<br>
Btw, all these “US didn’t do 9/11” is made by people who like Bush. So what you say is pure bullshit. there were no fkn terrorist, how the hell could the Twin towers burn and explode just like that when it gets hit by a plane? Either it had to be bombs in the Twin towers, or it was not a plane. Maybe a missile.</p>
<p>Ok, well, I live in the UK. I do not support, nor do I hate Bush. In my life, Bush plays no role, therefore I have no feelings for him.</p>
<p>Secondly, I take it you have seen footage of the attack. You saw a plane flying in to the center. Now, the first thing you will say is, “it has a bulge on the bottom, that surely suggests something?” As I explained in my earlier post, the clearest picture taken on that day was sent to a photo analysist. He explained that what you were seeing was merely the landing gear box which was exagerated by the light. Of course, we have no real proof of this. Then again, you have no proof it was a missile. The next thing you will say is “There was a light coming from the plane seconds before the plane hit. That was a missle being fired.” I don’t understand, how you<br>
can come to that conclusion just by seeing a white light. That light could of meant many o’ things. It can of been sunlight catching the metallic surface of the plane. It could be reflection of light coming from a world trade center window. If it was a missle, why did nothing come out of the plane before the impact. The next thing you may say is “It went right through the building, with an explosion coming out of the other end.” Now, really think about this. A plane hitting a building at 300+ Mph, it is bound to come through.</p>
<p>You also say there were bombs planted. First thing is, how does someone plant bombs without arrousing suspiscion? Out of the thousands i that center at the time, why wasn’t a bomb seen? How does someone get in; plant the bombs, and get out without a citizen getting suspiscious. Now, apparently, it was the same building take down as a planned demolished building. Think about it. The plane hit roughly 3/4 of the way up. Now thats maybe a few thousand tonnes resting on a damaged part. The preassure from the 1/4 left must of pushed so hard on the damaged area, it had to give way. The force from that taking down the rest of the buidling. No one ever came to the conclusion that fire burned it down.</p>
<p>And, if this was a conspiracy. Think of the many thousands of people who had to of haved knowledge on it. It just doesn’t add up to a conspiracy.</p>
<p>I have watched those films and I did understand where the writers were coming from. No matter what, there is always going to be a conspiracy. Most of the conspiracies made up by Liberal Extremeists.</p>
<p>Xerxes, I have nothing against you. I just don’t want you to fall for the same thing I did. I am 14 years of age and am ready to believe anything. My brother always used to pull pranks on me making me believe shit. I am very gullable. Although I am only 14 and you may be a few years older than me, please don’t take me for an idiot.</p>
<p>I feel like ending the discussion as it is not going anywhere. I say we agree to disagree. Please don’t say anything like “I owned you”, or any crap like that. I’m just simply not willing to carry on this conversation.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for reading mate. Have a good day <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>Chris, give up.  I am learning never to discuss politics with people on the internet, because when people can remain anonymous they are free to be as radical as they please, and won’t back down because they have nothing to lose.</p>
<p>Xerxes may or may not be a dumbass.  That’s irrelevant to this debate.  The point is that he’s not going to change his views no matter what you tell him, and you aren’t going to change your views (or at least I hope you won’t).  So, you two guys are going to butt heads, and this debate will degenerate into flaming.  As it is, we are now debating whether or not the US is responsible for 9/11, not whether the conspirator deserved to die or not.  So it’s already off topic.</p>
