    <title>9/11 Conspirator is not sentenced to death</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/9-11-conspirator-is-not-sentenced-to-death/2386</link>
    <description>Zacharias Masawi is the only person to be arrested for the 9/11 attacks. His death penalty trial took place a few days ago. He was sentenced to life in jail, by a jury made up of 12 of his peers. If he had been placed in a military tribunal and tried as an enemy combatant, he would have been quickly publicly executed. 

Interestingly, he said wanted to be killed. Then, when he was let off, he said America had lost and he had won. 0/12 of the jury said that his wish to be executed played a role in their decision, and 9/12 of the jury said that they were influenced by the racism that Masawi had experienced as a child.

Do you think sunnis and shiates would be fighting each other if the US did not invade iraq?
The country is rich in natural resources which are mostly exported. 40% of the profit goes to a royal family or leader while the rest of the money goes to the government which is barely enough to support the people

Does that give you an excuse to spread your beloved democracy? I have nothing against democracy infact i support it but i say the war had nothing to do with democracy. Yet that does not seem to prove that The mid eastern countries are controlling the US

<p>Let me elaborate on that. assuming your american (sorry if your not) u goto war in the middle east to pump out as much oil as possible.

We are getting oil. Oil prices in the US are lower than anywhere else in the world. I agree, the Arabs control us and it’s Bush’s (and every president for the past 25+ years) fault. We could switch to other fuels (for example, Brazil has completely stopped being dependent on foreign fuels…they use some kind of corn oil), but since they cost slightly more in the short term we don’t.</p>
<p>Personally I would pay 5$ a gallon if I knew I wasn’t supporting those crazy arab fucks.[/quote]</p>

<p>We are getting oil. Oil prices in the US are lower than anywhere else in the world. I agree, the Arabs control us and it’s Bush’s (and every president for the past 25+ years) fault. We could switch to other fuels (for example, Brazil has completely stopped being dependent on foreign fuels…they use some kind of corn oil), but since they cost slightly more in the short term we don’t.</p>
<p>Personally I would pay 5$ a gallon if I knew I wasn’t supporting those crazy arab fucks.</p>

<p>Xerxes may or may not be a dumbass.  That’s irrelevant to this debate.  The point is that he’s not going to change his views no matter what you tell him, and you aren’t going to change your views (or at least I hope you won’t).  So, you two guys are going to butt heads, and this debate will degenerate into flaming.  As it is, we are now debating whether or not the US is responsible for 9/11, not whether the conspirator deserved to die or not.  So it’s already off topic.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Firstly, the movies are biased. They are made by nothing more than liberal extremeists that do anything to try and bring down governments. Secondly, The site I provided you with is based around the films about all the nonsense. I can currently answer these questions:</p>
<p>Your question -<br>
Btw, all these “US didn’t do 9/11” is made by people who like Bush. So what you say is pure bullshit. there were no fkn terrorist, how the hell could the Twin towers burn and explode just like that when it gets hit by a plane? Either it had to be bombs in the Twin towers, or it was not a plane. Maybe a missile.</p>
<p>Ok, well, I live in the UK. I do not support, nor do I hate Bush. In my life, Bush plays no role, therefore I have no feelings for him.</p>
<p>Secondly, I take it you have seen footage of the attack. You saw a plane flying in to the center. Now, the first thing you will say is, “it has a bulge on the bottom, that surely suggests something?” As I explained in my earlier post, the clearest picture taken on that day was sent to a photo analysist. He explained that what you were seeing was merely the landing gear box which was exagerated by the light. Of course, we have no real proof of this. Then again, you have no proof it was a missile. The next thing you will say is “There was a light coming from the plane seconds before the plane hit. That was a missle being fired.” I don’t understand, how you<br>
can come to that conclusion just by seeing a white light. That light could of meant many o’ things. It can of been sunlight catching the metallic surface of the plane. It could be reflection of light coming from a world trade center window. If it was a missle, why did nothing come out of the plane before the impact. The next thing you may say is “It went right through the building, with an explosion coming out of the other end.” Now, really think about this. A plane hitting a building at 300+ Mph, it is bound to come through.</p>
<p>You also say there were bombs planted. First thing is, how does someone plant bombs without arrousing suspiscion? Out of the thousands i that center at the time, why wasn’t a bomb seen? How does someone get in; plant the bombs, and get out without a citizen getting suspiscious. Now, apparently, it was the same building take down as a planned demolished building. Think about it. The plane hit roughly 3/4 of the way up. Now thats maybe a few thousand tonnes resting on a damaged part. The preassure from the 1/4 left must of pushed so hard on the damaged area, it had to give way. The force from that taking down the rest of the buidling. No one ever came to the conclusion that fire burned it down.</p>
<p>And, if this was a conspiracy. Think of the many thousands of people who had to of haved knowledge on it. It just doesn’t add up to a conspiracy.</p>
<p>I have watched those films and I did understand where the writers were coming from. No matter what, there is always going to be a conspiracy. Most of the conspiracies made up by Liberal Extremeists.</p>
<p>Xerxes, I have nothing against you. I just don’t want you to fall for the same thing I did. I am 14 years of age and am ready to believe anything. My brother always used to pull pranks on me making me believe shit. I am very gullable. Although I am only 14 and you may be a few years older than me, please don’t take me for an idiot.</p>
<p>I feel like ending the discussion as it is not going anywhere. I say we agree to disagree. Please don’t say anything like “I owned you”, or any crap like that. I’m just simply not willing to carry on this conversation.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for reading mate. Have a good day <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I have no doubts Bush and his mates planned this. Yet, you came up with 2-3 points that I hardly talked about…I guess… respond to my questions, watch the film or whatever.</p>
<p>Btw, all these “US didn’t do 9/11” is made by people who like Bush. So what you say is pure bullshit. there were no fkn terrorist, how the hell could the Twin towers burn and explode just like that when it gets hit by a plane? Either it had to be bombs in the Twin towers, or it was not a plane. Maybe a missile.</p>
<p>I read about a couple buildings who was on fire for like 24 hours or more, and those buildings was older, and it didnt explode nor fall down or whatever.</p>
<p>Man, just use your brain and you will understand the truth.</p>
<p>Answer my questions, look at the movie and answer those questions and then I may believe you that US didn’t do it, kthx.</p>
<p>And the logic is very clear:<br>
All those leaders have been trained not to give a damn about the people. Atleast thats what I think.<br>
They are ready to kill thousands of people, to accomplish what their want - I have no idea why they could have done it, whoever a couple reasons: War with Iraq, Iran, Afganistan and other countries, even Bush himself said World War 3 has started. A idea like this was brought to Kennedy, and he denied it all. So, why you telling me this wouldn’t happen?</p>
<p>etc etc I could write forever but I am lazy now.</p>
<p>Answer my questions, the films questions and I may believe you.</p>
<p>And you know, a profit they get from this? Bushs family, or Dick Cheneys corporations that sells guns, or deals with oil etc.</p>

i dont know if this has anything to do with the ^^ topic but he is right america has lost and the mid-eastearn countries have won. The u.s. debt is soo freakin high that the country will collapse in 5 years.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/</a></p>
<p>this is the current us debt</p>
<p>$8,354,235,972,701.79</p>
<p>"The estimated population of the United States is 298,646,034<br>
so each citizen’s share of this debt is $27,973.70.</p>
<p>The National Debt has continued to increase an average of<br>
$1.95 billion per day since September 30, 2005!"</p>
<p>If the U.S. went to war with Iran i have no doubt in my mind that Iran will win. They will defeat the u.s. in the nuclear war. president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will show no mercy.</p>
<p>This is not an biaist opinnion because im a from France and i am just showing the facts.</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
Hey, Buddy… Your own damn country was bankrupt after helping funding the U.S.A. in their revoluntionary battle. Did your country collapse? Nope… Btw: Before you talk crap about the U.S. think about fighting your own battles… Obvisouly, You would get your arse kicked if the U.S. wasn’t an ally…[/quote] honestly i dont think he was trying to make fun… im from the us of a as well and i agree with his, our country has suffered a VERY,( dont even get me started ) VERY!!! defishient income rate sence bush came to office… when clintin was prez, gas was $1.90 now its a frickin $3.40 were i live and is rizing by 2 cents every day… also, “buddy” he is just explaining the facts, dont get a Non-bright eyed and bushytailed becuz he states his opinion.</p>

              <p>sdcit, if you are talking to me. Yes I read all those pages. Xerxes, I could bring up a lot more points. Everything that is on Google Videos is either fake, true or complete bullshit. The category the conspiracy fulls under is the 3rd one. I don’t understand why you can’t see you havent been brainwashed. I just don’t understand it. What logic is there in killing thousands of your own people?</p>
