    <title>Blocking invalid usernames</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/blocking-invalid-usernames/274646</link>
    <description>I want to make it so when a player attempts to log on with a !, ~, @, etc. it won&#39;t let them on period. I don&#39;t want it to log them on, disconnect them, then ban them, I want it to just not them on at all and just display the message &quot;Your account had been disabled - please check your message center for details.&quot; or whatever. So I added this under my initialize method:

[code]	for(char c : playerName.toCharArray()) {
	if(!Character.isLetterOrDigit(c)) {
	if(Character.isSpaceChar(c)) continue;
	returnCode = 4;
		}
	}[/code]

I&#39;m pretty sure that works but how can I make it so they can&#39;t log in period? I tried using returnCode = 4;, but it failed to work. Help is appreciated. Thanks. :)</description>
