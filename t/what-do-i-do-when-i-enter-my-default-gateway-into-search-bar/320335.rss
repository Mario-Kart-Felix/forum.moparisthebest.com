i clicked&#39;FIREWALL&#39; and is says     your Router is equipped with a firewall that will protect your network from a wide array of common hacker attacks including Ping of Death (PoD) and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. You can turn the firewall function off if needed. Turning off the firewall protection will not leave your network completely vulnerable to hacker attacks, but it is recommended that you turn the firewall on whenever possible.


So do i disable it so people can connect?

              <p>in your firewall you can add ports that let people get through with that port (43594) if you do that it should work but im not 100% on this</p>
