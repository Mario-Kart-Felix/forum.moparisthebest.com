    <description>Many of you may have noticed i posted like ten times last night about my new Chat Server. Well for anyone who cares or read my posts, i finally got it all working. Thanks to everyone who attempted to help me, in the end i figured it out by just pasting a bunch of code in place and working out the errors  until it worked. Once i have added private chat and account verification to it i will post a link to it if anyone wants a copy.
It doesn&#39;t really work with the rs servers, but it is nice to have if you want to remove yell from your server, that way the game chat is not so full.
I guess i will make htis into a development question so mods dont get mad at me, does anyone have any ideas i can add to it?
currently i am working on adding a few text effects, and making the passwords actualy do something.

anyone who wants to check it out, its not that interesting i guess, but jsut incase, jsut click start bar, then run, then type &quot;telnet 1mixscape1.servegame.com&quot; and you should connect</description>
