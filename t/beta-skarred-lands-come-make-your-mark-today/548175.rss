[size=20pt]Why Skarred?[/size]
     Skarred Lands is a RuneScape Private Server (RSPS) server from the 317 revision. It does have content from higher and more recent revisions, but it&#39;s not the newest. It still has an old-school feel to it, while not really being old school. What sets our server apart from others is how our server is ran. We put the community first, because if they&#39;re not satisfied, we&#39;re not. Don&#39;t be mistaken, though, because our updates are anything besides normal. One week we may just be updating some bugs, and the next week we could be releasing a new minigame or similar. We like to keep our players guessing, and our staff guessing a little more. 
I hope to see you in game soon,
     Mod Watson


[size=20pt]An Important Message[/size]
     Our server is in a [u]public beta[/u] right now. Which means two things (mostly). One is that [u]all players must register on the forums to play[/u]. I know most people hate this requirement, and it is planned to be removed, but it is needed for the beta because it is important that players report any and all bugs to the staff, and having you on the forums already just puts you one step closer to doing that. Two, it means that our server isn&#39;t perfect. I will not guarantee your current experience as we are attempting to patch whatever bugs are left on top of adding new content and more updates.

<p>And with today’s updates, it’s even better. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
[hr]<br>
I promised you guys I’d do something with the Mysterious Caves, well there you go.<br>
You can now fish Rocktail and cavefish using their respectable shoals in the mysterious caves. I’ve also put the LRC creatures from runescape in the caves. Each creature drops living minerals, and have drops similar to RuneScape’s.</p>
<p>Server:</p>
<p><code>
Replaced NPCs in Mysterious caves.
Added rocktail and cavefish support for fishing &amp; cooking
Added new fishing spawns in Mysterious caves.
Added support for fishing spots to "Die". They don't move though. Spawn timers are random.
Added new shop at home "Grummy's Goods"
Removed all but home teleport tab from general store, and added the tab to make teleports in place.
Made weapons in Weapon Roulette a lot more random than before. You'll never guess what weapon comes next..
Fixed leather crafting not crafting the item displayed.
Fixed firemaking, now has ashes, walking back, global objects, etc..
Fixed leather crafting not removing all leathers.
Updated some boss npc's stats (I might have forgot which ones...)</code></p>
<p>I’ve only got 1 gif, but I hope you enjoy it all the same…<br>

<p><code>Fixed Pure Ess mining in some locations.
Edited Crystal Chest messages to be more dynamic towards the players inventory (As if it matters)
Rewrote RFD minigame, fixing it being inaccessible.
Also rewrote the RFD minigame shop handler.

Similar to RFD, rewrote 90% or so of the code to Fight Caves.
      Fixed Fight Caves (jad minigame) not starting.
      Fixed Tz-Kih prayer draining ability
      Added entrance message to Fight Caves
      Fixed npcs not spawning out of view, or not doing anything when barley in view

<p>I use gifcam, personally. It’s simple, hella easy to use. and has like 5 different export types.<br>
It looks like this:<br>
