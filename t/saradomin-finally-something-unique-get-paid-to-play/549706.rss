Update log will be edited on the main thread weekly, rather then every single day. However, I will post any updates as they are made.
Each update listed is simply the commit  message from our repository, to avoid going through 20+ pages and saying each and every change, for each commit on each page. Some commit comments are very unexplainitory, fixes to other commits, addition to previous commits, may contain more then the comment says, or may be simple a few lines changed.

              <p>Bump. Fixed any and all links on the website that were redirecting wrong. Started adding in the plugins for Subscriber Perks. Fixed the issue where account wasnt created ingame on forums registration. Was due to a referral package we added. Fixed an issue with the mouse disappearing in the client (Will be updated in the next client we put up, with multiple changes). Converted our shop system to work with the current json rather then txt to save time, the new shop interface and system will be released in the next client update. Added last clan chat joined sub text, when typing in a clan chat to join. Auto join last clan chat on login added. Added a discount subscription package for 20% off one month available at registration only.</p>

<p>Update log will be edited on the main thread weekly, rather then every single day. However, I will post any updates as they are made.<br>
Each update listed is simply the commit  message from our repository, to avoid going through 20+ pages and saying each and every change, for each commit on each page. Some commit comments are very unexplainitory, fixes to other commits, addition to previous commits, may contain more then the comment says, or may be simple a few lines changed.<br>
