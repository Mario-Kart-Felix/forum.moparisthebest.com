    <title>Help picking a topic?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-picking-a-topic/365106</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve got a research paper to write..

[i]Choose a subject related to graphical user interfaces for your topic.  You may select a GUI feature or technique, an individual who was a pioneer of some renown in the field of GUI, or you may compare two different methods of user interaction.  Your paper should reflect an adequate amount of college level research and should not be a description of your own experience.[/i]

Anyone got any decent ideas? I wanted to do Common User Access but I couldn&#39;t find anything but internet sources and IBM articles that needed to be purchased... Also it kind of strays away from the requirement. I need a topic that can be found in multiple types of references.


Thanks,
Adam</description>

              <p>Touch screens and multi touch user interfaces would be a good topic. In addition to obvious things like the iPhone you could cover stylus based input and OCR.</p>
