    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-play-guitar/198253</link>
    <description>If you have a guitar post how long you&#39;ve had i,t how long you&#39;ve playing what sort of guitar you have, what sort of guitar your first was and how good do you actually think you are [serious.] anyone actually in a band and think/hope they will actually get somewhere?

I play guitar, I have an electric acoustic atm its just a shit ebay one because I got no cash atm but once I do I want to get a Gibson SG my first guitar was a Monterey Electric. I am probably about average and had my electric for 1 yr before it got broken and hadn&#39;t got a new guitar till 4 yrs later :( so I missed alot of practice time but I am back into it with my acoustic.</description>

              <p>Well playing chords and singing is easy, however playing loads of different notes and singing is another story. I definately advise you to steer clear of buying a BC RICH WARLOCK. I’m not sure about gibsons but I heard they are quite good. You should look into what you could get in the ibanez range for the same price as a gibson.</p>

              <p>Nice, I actually was/am thinking of buying a BC Warlock because it looks pretty cool and most of my friends who don’t know much about guitar would think its amazing, one of my friends who does know a bit though also has an Ibanez I have played it and they are quite good but atm my favourite guitar is the Gibson SG which is what I am hoping to get. I also use Guitar Pro always its an awesome program. Signing along is something I have tried to do and really want to be able to do but it is really hard and I can’t do it yet but hope to soon.</p>

Its an alright guitar, but you can’t play it standing up(something us men know a lot about amirite?) and its not a good one for begginers like me.<br>
My current guitar is an ibanez [SA S36 FM] seen here:<br>
<img src="http://www.audio-electric-shop.de/shop/catalog/images/Ibanez-SAS36FM_DRS.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
I have to say I really love this guitar, playing it is so natural and its so god damn light! I really do have to recommend Ibanez’s to everyone (Thanks a lot to the forum user HEX KEY whom hasn’t been seen in a while, because he was the person who told me to get an ibanez, and i have to say this was the best advice i’ve nearly ever listened to from a person met on the internets.)</p>
<p>I’m not that good at the guitar, I only really play when I want to let off some stress and be creative. I also love to sing along to guitar chords, and that is why I also recently bought a cheap acoustic guitar. I like to also use Guitar pro to play along to the tabs because its so easy to just watch the tab moving along and playing it.</p>
<p>I play guitar with my friends sometimes, infact recently me and my friend have been playing “Give em hell kid” by my chemical romance on guitar and its so much fun. My other friend also wants me to be in a band but I think the commitment isn’t what I want to do. I love playing but I don’t want to get into a band where we have a set rehersal because it would make me hate playing the guitar. I also don’t really want to become a band because I know we won’t get anywhere plus the fact I have college which I don’t need anymore destractions from!</p>
