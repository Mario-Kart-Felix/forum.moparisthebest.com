    <title>Client Compiling</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-compiling/247326</link>
    <description>I know this isn&#39;t really requesting help with &#39;servers,&#39; but I didn&#39;t think it would be appropriate to post in 317 client hacking or the moparscape client sections. Anyways, whenever we attempt to compile our open source client, we get 100+ errors. First javac wasn&#39;t recognized, so we went through the task of defining the environmental variables, now there are numerous errors starting with the very first java file it tries to compile. Originally, the client consisted of only class files, but we decompiled all of them. Without editing any of files before or after decompilation, we still get errors when compiling. Although, before we decompiled, the client would run fine. Is there something we&#39;ve overlooked? We don&#39;t really have a clue whats wrong so much help is appreciated.  :)</description>
