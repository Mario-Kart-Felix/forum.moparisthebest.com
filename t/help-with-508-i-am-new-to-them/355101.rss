2)Does anyone have a 508 command Generator i can download?
3)How can i edit the quest tab?
4)How can i edit the experience given?
That&#39;s all i have atm :|, but i might add more :|, and please don&#39;t give me some answer like &quot;login.java,&quot; i need information like as if i was asking to make myself admin, i would please like an answer like &quot;Go to login.java, then search &quot;rights&quot; without the quotes, then change the past owners name in the &quot; &quot;, to yours. OR please paste a code or something,
