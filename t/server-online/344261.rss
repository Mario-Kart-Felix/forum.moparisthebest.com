    <description>Ok, so I am using a Verizon Router, given to my by my provider. I have port forwarded using the &#39;RuneScape Private Server&#39; tutorial on PortForward.com. After the tutorial I used the port checker to see if the ports were open and they both read (Both TCP, and UDP) that they were open. With No-Ip open and my server and client running I could [b]NOT[/b] connect using the IP just localhost. Any Help?

Edit: It&#39;s around 5 in the morning where I am, and I&#39;m going to take a brief nap. If you have any information that may help, please post it.</description>

              <p>yeh i could help jsut fixed this for someone else. ok after you do everything with port forwarding your not done theres 1 more very important step. open up your firewall options click exeptions. then click add and add RsPrivateServer or w.e name you want. put the port as the port your using and put the last option as tcp.</p>
<p>what this does:: just portforwarding doesnt do it all you need to also do this so you can allow people to go through you firewall. this does not harm your pc an anyway</p>
