    <title>Pvp drops and magic delay</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pvp-drops-and-magic-delay/316370</link>
    <description>i have two questions, one is the source im using has a pvp drop system and id like to have it where just the inventory is dropped rather than random items could someone please help me with that?

also the magic delay for some spells is short and you can cast spells such as ice barrage as fast as you can click does anyone know how to fix this? also it says //created by bakatool for ice barrage, not sure what that means.

its a delta base 

thanks</description>
