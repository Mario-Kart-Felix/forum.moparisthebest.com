[center][size=18pt]Intro[/size]

Hey guys, my name is Tom. I have always loved programming, I have hosted quite a bit of servers in the past and was co-owner on helix-world (dark). Now I just want to get together a team which should know quite a bit about java programming. I have enough knowledge to make minigames, fun skills, and other stuff. I prefer to use eclipse (IDE) and would hope that my team would use one as well to keep the project as neat at possible. Currently there is hope that once we make a great server we can host it and watch people enjoy what we made. We will be using a cleaned PI which could be switched to hyperion if the team is talented enough to handle it. We will make a server with content that hasn&#39;t been seen before, this includes custom bosses, minigames, better ways to stabilize the economy. More information about the project will be discussed on skype. [/center]

If you would like to join this project please fill the information below corresponding to your position choice.
As mentioned in the intro, you have to have decent knowledge in java so that you won&#39;t be a burden on the team. To make sure we get no one that will slow down progress, you will be tested on skype before being added to the team.

I am pretty much working on a similar project, I am basically taking a 2006 remake, and improving its core and its content.<br>
I like to imagine we were jagex and we made our own 6 years of updates <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
