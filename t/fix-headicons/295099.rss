    <title>Fix headicons</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fix-headicons/295099</link>
    <description>Ok, this is the easiest way to do headicons. Instead of doing it Bluurrs way, where the server writes 3 bytes, and the client reads 3 bytes and the client reads 3 bytes, you just make the server write 1 int, and the client read 1 int. It also increase the number of available headicons to 30 at any 1 time.

Ok, the first step is to go into your Player.java and search for this:
[code]
playerProps.writeByte(headIcon);[/code]

Or something along those lines, depending on your server. Now, simpy replace that with this:
[code]
playerProps.writeWord(headIcon);[/code]


That&#39;s all you need to do to the server. Save, compile, etc.

Now, in the client, Go to Class30_Sub2_Sub4_Sub1_Sub2, and search for:
[code]
anInt1706 =[/code]

And you should see something like this:
[code]
anInt1706 = class30_sub2_sub2.method408();[/code]

Simply replace that with this:
[code]
anInt1706 = class30_sub2_sub2.method410();//method410() is the name for readInt()[/code]

Save, compile, etc.

Less lines than bluurrs method. Simple, but not much of an accomplishment.

Enjoy.

PS: make sure that in client.java, it&#39;s loading headicons_prayer isntead of headicons.
