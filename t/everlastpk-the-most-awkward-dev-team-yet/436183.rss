    <description>Well here&#39;s the thing. I&#39;m not hosting the server. I have a sub-par server, a domain, a site linked to the domain and so on. I don&#39;t want to host I want to be the web site coder.

I&#39;m Excellent with HTML (and HTML5), CSS, a little Javascript, some php. And flash. I made a flash media player through Adobe flash and XML, it can be used on the site if someone would like it. It&#39;s not big or fancy, it just loads songs in xml, plays, skips, pauses and goes back. There is no shuffle but it does display what song and artist is playing.

I know most people that start a dev team are the head coder for the server. But this time, I&#39;m the head coder for the website, but I do know a fair share of Java and PI server coding.


I don&#39;t have an exact application format or who will do what (Head coder will sort this out) but here is what I got for finding the Head Coder:

[code]
1. Age:
2. Experience:
3. Proof:
4. MSN/Skype:
5: Job applying for:
[/code]

Edit: If you are accepted as head coder and do use my server, there is one bug that I have yet to figure out how to solve. It has something to do with the money pouch. Some how ids can get max money with it, but then again, you can always disable the money pouch.</description>
