        <p>Indiana judge ruled Mondy that Planned Motherhood of Indiana need to turn over to the state the medical documents of its patients under 14.Marion County Exceptional Court Judge Kenneth Brown sided with the Indy attorney general’s office in its quest to examine the medical records of 84 young people.Planned Parenthood attemptedto stop the seizure, arguing which investigators were on a “fishing expedition,” perhaps to identify the partners of sexually active 12- as well as 13-year-olds. None of the 84 individuals has received an abortion, according to Planned Parenthood.The attorney general’s office has said that its Medicaid fraud device "is investigating whether or not children were neglected due to a failure to record instances of child molestation to the proper authorities."Since a primary March 1 seizure with the medical records regarding eight clients, Designed Parenthood has advised its clinics not to turn over medical data to the fraud control unit. Health care providers which refuse to cooperate using Medicaid fraud investigators can be disqualified from the software.Indiana law describes sexual activity with a child under 14 while child molesting, no matter how aged the partner will be.    no previous page following    1/2  <a href="http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutlet.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutlet.html</a><br>
