    <title>OpenCL Ray Caster (3D Graphics)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/opencl-ray-caster-3d-graphics/552605</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been writing an OpenCL Ray Caster the last couple of days.

The source code can be found at my [url=https://github.com/macroing/OpenRC]GitHub Page[/url].

By default I have 500 spheres and four point lights in the scene. It runs at around 60 FPS on my machine with that.

Do you have OpenCL 1.1 or later?</p>
<p>Taharok &amp; Eyeownyew: I’m using a library called Aparapi. It compiles the Java bytecode in the run() method and all run-reachable methods (as they call it) on the fly, to C99 code, which OpenCL is using. So there are quite a few limitations to how you can write your Java code.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I made some changes to how you build the project and fixed some issues with running it. I had not tested to clone, build and run before. But now I have. It didn’t work, but now it does (at least for me).</p>
<p>I also updated your starting position in the scene, so you should hopefully see spheres when you start it, unlike before, when you had to walk around to find them.</p>
<p>A few new controls have been added. Press ESC to exit (it may require a few presses if you’re running in JTP (Java Thread Pool) execution mode, as it’s pretty unresponsive then). Press E to display your current execution mode to the standard output. They can be GPU or JTP (Java Thread Pool) at this time. Press T to toggle between execution modes.[/quote]</p>
<p>It does this during runtime? That’s ridiculous. I’m very impressed by it, actually. It sounds like a neat idea, but I’m surprised someone actually did it. Why not just use C directly? Haha, seems like a ton of effort to go through just to use Java. Meh. I see some huge limitations, too. Either way, it’s cool.</p>

<p>It’s super cool, but I very intrigued by this library that lets you specify Java methods for OpenCL kernel programs. How on earth does that work? Does it use the native compiled version of the Java bytecode and somehow upload that to the graphics card? I’m a bit confused because doesn’t C/C++ code configured for OpenCL or CUDA require a separate extension to compilers to compile it in an intermediary form for the graphics driver to send to the GPU for execution? How does that work to Java? I just haven’t heard of such a thing and didn’t realize this was possible.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t know much about this topic at all, but from my experience with OpenGL it’s just Java bindings. Methods exist in java as replacements/extensions of the C methods, and are used in the exact same fashion. There isn’t much (if any) object oriented code when using these bindings in Java, so it’s very similar to programming in C, and the library just sort of acts like an interface. It looks like this is how Jocl works too, though I’m not sure what library object is using, and if he’s not using any (bindings, that is) I don’t know how it works.</p>
