RuneScorp The Delta&#39;s Best

Starting position is runescape tutorial island and yes you have to complete it currently coded up to smithing area all you need to do is complete vannaka part also remember all delta servers with the 8 quest this now has 15 quests including more strategy and wackeness they are harder but more fun!

Godswords

Now the godswords were very similar to the skillcapes as i had to create the model and gfx myself by obviously being patient and working hard at it the specials are still the same though i couldnt get them any different sadly i will try next time though...some how lol.


RuneScorp Has just been finished off created today by the owner Rune-Scorp and its a huge multi-player pvp system entertaining game with monsters to kill , points and items to claim and has every feature of a server you couldnt imagine so Download and enjoy and have more fun than ever! Thankyou RuneScorp Take a look at pictures please that explains it all

The Stability of the server is amazing it has all great features and its still only 836kb file size it holds many players as i have cleaned out alot of data that didnt need to be in the file so basically what im saying is its really a clean server.

Now lets get on to the specials basically im not going to take a picture of every special because takes to long but it has all of the specials

Well Thanks for looking i hope it makes you want to Download theres tons more features and the home base by the way is lumbridge.

 

Prayers also works inc. Piety , Smite and so on also its an economy based server with medium Training and there is no Beginer Teleports or anything like that its basic RuneScape Lumbridge,Falador,Camelot,Catherby,Ardgoune,Varrock and so on there the basic teleport but to get godwars and stuff you have to walk there same as RuneScape like teleport to Falador then walk from there and so on i think you get the idea Every npc Position is same as runescape so basically to do beginer train walk to goblins , cows or chickens.
