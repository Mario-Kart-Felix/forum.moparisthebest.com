This is the SCAR Usage guide i promised after my first Tut.

In the right of the tools bar, you will see a crosshair, Before you start a script, you must always drag this crosshair onto the RS screen.

In the middle, you will see a start and stop button, you will use these to.. Start and stop.

At the bottom, you will see a debug box, this is where error messages will appear, you can see i&#39;ve been testing a fishing script lol.

Next to the Rubber, is the Color Picker, You will use this tool  to pick a color on the RS Mainscreen, then it will be saved to your clipboard and you can paste it onto your constant menu.

Make sure you keep up with includes, when a new include comes out, be sure to download it and set it up properly before using any scripts.

Also, If you want to ever terminate a script, use Ctrl+Alt+S.
Ctrl+Alt+R is to Run a script.

F9 is to compile a script without running it.

Last of all, all good scripts should have good comments on it, FOLLOW THEM.

~Happy Cheating~
