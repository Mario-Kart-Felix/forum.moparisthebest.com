    <title>Custom Crowns</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-crowns/480999</link>
    <description>I want to add some custom crowns, instead of using those 2 the server comes with, and I don&#39;t like a lot of that I&#39;ve seen around the net.
Here are my ranks[There&#39;s 12, 14 including the donor ranks]:

[ol][li]Dethroned - I.E Staff that has been revoked of their rank. This title is a must for them, and cannot be changed, it shows the rest of the players they lost their rank, and can&#39;t get it back.[/li]
[li]Ex-Staff - Someone who left on their own accord, or just isn&#39;t active enough to keep their rank. They are still forced to wear the title, but it shows they don&#39;t have staff on a good account, unlike above.[/li]
[li]Trial Mod[/li]
[li]Trial Admin[/li]
[li]Forum Staff[/li]
[li]Mod[/li]
[li]Head Mod[/li]
[li]Super Mod - Not better than head mod, mod on both site and server[/li]
[li]Admin[/li]
[li]Head Admin[/li]
[li]Super Admin - Not better than head admin, but admin on both site and server[/li]
[li]Owner[/li][/ol]


[s]Donors:[/s]

[ol][li][s]Donor[/li]
[li][s]Super Donor[/li]
[li][s] [Possibly] Server Donor[/li][/ol]


Now, I&#39;d like to see some creativity. But they need to be 12 x 13
[s]For Donors, I have the Red Donor icon, but I&#39;d like 2 recolors. 1 being green and one being purple.[/s]
A few ideas:
Forum staff - a greenish crown with a black/white F on it
Dethroned - A crown with no rank on it, behind jail bars, please make it look different than the rest. Black and while would be cool.
Ex-staff - A blank crown, preferably the one used for dethroned, just no jail bars.
Trial Staff - Blue Crown with the resembling rank on it.
Mod - Red Crown/white text.
Head Mod- White Crown/Red Text.
Super Mod- Rainbow Crown/White text (assuming it doesn&#39;t look like shit on the rainbow)
Admin - Purple Crown/White Text.
Head Admin - White Crown/Purple Text.
Super Admin - Same as Super Mod, with admin rank on it.
Owner - This one, is really up to you. But Red/Black is always cool ;)
Note:
I&#39;d like them all to be the same crown, if possible. With the above edits, so my server doesn&#39;t look funky :)

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and if you made any crowns, make me the crowns

P.S:
I&#39;m looking for a gfx&#39;er, if interested, please tell me.</description>

<p>Also “Server Donor”? Where the hell are people coming up with this shit?[/quote]<br>
The back of my tired brain.<br>
Got a better name for it?<br>
Shoot.<br>
but really though, I’ve had 5 hours of sleep in the past 2 days<br>
Edit:<br>
Oh, about your remark on how many staff I have.<br>
This system is implemented to ensure player safty, and no confusion on what players are/aren’t staff. The trial ranks are only for if a person has been newly promoted, or are on stand for abuse of power, etc.</p>
<p>It’s similar to Rocket’s staff implementation, but this is my own.</p>
