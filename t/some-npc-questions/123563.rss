    <description>Alright I need help with 2 things, 1. I want to be able to talk to certain npcs, not for quests but for players to get help, for example, you join my server and you talk to the combat instructor for tips, Also if there anyway to get the ship fares working like, port salim to karamaja because I made some npcs on this random island and I spawned a sailor and a boat there and I think it would be cool if I could get someone to transport me there, like make a boat and a sailor at ardougne docks and when you talk to him he transports you to the other destination.

              <p>Sorry but I’m just on a tight schedule because I’m leaving for upstate soon and I just wanted to run my server privately for some friends I know, If those triple posts add onto my count then a mod can remove them with no doubt from me, I just didn’t think they did because they were in the same post.</p>
