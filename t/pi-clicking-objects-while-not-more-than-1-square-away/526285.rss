    <title>[PI] Clicking objects while not more than 1 square away</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-clicking-objects-while-not-more-than-1-square-away/526285</link>
    <description>So here is the situation:

Packet error that occurs occasionally, most likely relevant because I tested my client with another source and the clicking works and no packet error.

packet Error?
[code]
Error: T1 - 123,0 - 36,36
[/code] 

Actual Problem:

If I am more than 1 square away and one click a bank booth(Or any object) I will run over to them and the action will occur. However if I am standing right next to them and one click the object the action will not occur. 

If I right click the object and choose the second option IE(Quickly Bank) I can be at any distance. 

Since my Client works with another source without this error I can safely assume it is something server sided. Been sifting through my object clicking with no luck so far.</description>

              <p>The problem is in not being able to one click any object that results in an action unless I’m more than 1 square away.</p>
<p>Altars, Chests, banks, doors(not opening but attaching say a tele to them).</p>
<p>[edit]-finally fixed it.</p>
