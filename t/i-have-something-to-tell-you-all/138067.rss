    <description>Hello,
You all know me as D E C O Y.

I have something to tell you all.
I never had a server,
I never had anything advanced.

I am doing this to try to get a second chance at Mscp.

I will not lie again.
and Moparisthebest, im sorry for spreading rumors.

Im just tired of seeing the same old &quot;An error has occured!&quot; page.

sorry.
