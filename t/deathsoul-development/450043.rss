    <description>[center]Im not posting a tread all about what i want to add and need people because i feel that if you&#39;ve done it on your own or had alittle help with it its more you learn so heres what iv add and what im going to add

What im working on now

Im making a new minigame called deathwars. Its a pvp type game that has two teams of 3-5 players that kill each other untill one team reachs 25 kills. after thats reached the game will send all players back to lobby area

I added a grandexchange base... need to fix interface and make it more user freindly

Im also working on a way to convert the queen black dragon into a pi server

what im going to add in the next weeks

Domination tower 
Random Events like runescape
I have to sof interface just need to code the wheel spinning and random items in boxs
Clue scroll with 3-4 stages before the chest is found
making a lunar spells work instead of just 3-4
adding more spells to magic
make a member and f2p area (all Armors are f2p)
remove skilling area and make it more world map 
adding effects to all items
loyalty award system like runescape but get points every 96hours
auras that when activated their effects work
Full working soul wars (online have lobby area and tele into game working)
castle wars
Full Warriors guild not just armor

Please dont flame this is my development for my server i already have all my skill at 90-100% full working with interface and all
