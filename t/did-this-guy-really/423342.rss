    <title>Did this guy really...?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/did-this-guy-really/423342</link>
    <description>Okay i was walking around with my girlfriend at a local mall, and this random guy, he seemed like a business guy trying to sell his product, came up to our group and asked us if we wanted to be part of an experiment to not feel pain.

I though this guy was crazy but one of my friends was playing around and kept nudging him to give us more information.
So basically what i got out of this is, our brain is like a computer where it sends signals everywhere throughout our body to make us feel pain,hunger, and fatigue. He suggested that with some type of technology that requires no surgery or pills whatsoever, i was guessing some type of electrical waves, they can disable some of these nerves and imply it to a computer...

Soooo basically we wouldn&#39;t feel heat or coldness, yet our body temperature will emit on a reader and we would just feel as though our temperature is neutral. .

I want to know your thoughts of this, i think this guy is crazy because this is the first time I&#39;ve ever heard of something like this before.</description>

<p>Not feeling pain != super humans. Quite the opposite.</p>
<p>If you’re out of touch with your pain receptors you’re basically asking to die very very fast (all be it without pain) but how do you know something you picked up is too hot?.. or that you’re standing on a nail. If anything more serious happens you have no idea which part of you is hurt (can no longer explain where it hurts to a doctor) this means injuries get worse and worse; ie walking around with a nail in your foot is only going to get infected and widen the wound.

<p>The eventuality is, this would be a death sentence and I imagine it would be one carried out by the ignorance of your own injuries.</p>
<p>EDIT: Should be noted there are people out there that suffer from this naturally due to a genetic defect, con[size=72pt]<span class="bbcode-b">genital anal</span>[/size]gesia asociated with several diseases and genetic disorders is a nasty ailment that if you’re born with it is incredibly dangerous. The mere fact these children have never felt pain means eating a meal is dangerous as if it’s too hot they’ll just burn their insides without any realisation. Often, they don’t even know they’re hungry and they can quite easily bite off their own tongue. If you were the sort of person who bites their nails with this condition, you could quite easily knaw your fingers off, it seems ridiculous to us, but if you have no stimuli to indiciate you shouldn’t be doing it (pain) then you can quite easily assume it’s OK to do and they’ll just grow back.</p>
<p>I should probably mention you don’t have to be born with this, there are degenerative diseases than can lay dormant and start destruction of never cells at any point in life.</p>
<p>I think my underlying point here is that not feeling pain is completely overrated  ;D[/quote]</p>

<p>your brain is a computer but the analogy is bad, love hunger feeling etc are only possible because of the brain, and technology can “interact” with the brain or control certain functions but it’s more likely that it will be a drug[/quote]</p>
<p>This. The brain processes signals from nerve ends. If you cut yours finger tip, the nerve ends detect this and send a signal via your nerves to your brain. Your brain recognizes this signal, and knows where it came from. So you feel the pain at it’s origin, but the pain itself is ‘caused’ by your brain. If you cut the nerve, you won’t be able to feel it.</p>
<p>There are substances that mess with the nervous system, which are a necessetity in surgery. But if you use them when you are walking about, not only will you walk like an idiot (you can’t feel your feet)(if you can walk at all), but you’ll probably die of blood loss or something because you can’t feel when you get wounded.</p>
<p>I doubt you can disable the nervous system with waves. The nerves are essentially wires, and you can’t stop the signals from reaching your brain without cutting them. You can however cut the wires and stick them in a device, which is linked to your brain. But such a device doesn’t exist yet, and it requires surgery.</p>

Sounds like he was trying to do a psychological test on you where. He’d probably put you in a room and tell you it’s getting hotter but you shouldn’t be able to feel it so you’d just assume it is. Something like that!<br>

              <p>Okay i was walking around with my girlfriend at a local mall, and this random guy, he seemed like a business guy trying to sell his product, came up to our group and asked us if we wanted to be part of an experiment to not feel pain.</p>
<p>I though this guy was crazy but one of my friends was playing around and kept nudging him to give us more information.<br>
So basically what i got out of this is, our brain is like a computer where it sends signals everywhere throughout our body to make us feel pain,hunger, and fatigue. He suggested that with some type of technology that requires no surgery or pills whatsoever, i was guessing some type of electrical waves, they can disable some of these nerves and imply it to a computer…</p>
<p>Soooo basically we wouldn’t feel heat or coldness, yet our body temperature will emit on a reader and we would just feel as though our temperature is neutral. .</p>
<p>I want to know your thoughts of this, i think this guy is crazy because this is the first time I’ve ever heard of something like this before.</p>
