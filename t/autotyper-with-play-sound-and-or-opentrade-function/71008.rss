    <title>Autotyper with play sound and/or opentrade function!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/autotyper-with-play-sound-and-or-opentrade-function/71008</link>
    <description>Omg this is a long time ago i visited mopar, i was like almost forgotten this site.
To appolagize me i just wanne post this script i made long ago.
It&#39;s an autotyper that will play a sound and opens a trade when a trade has been found (both ot 1 of those 2).
I used SendText in my script because TypeSend; doesn&#39;t types numbers for me (also not : &gt; : is a /) so yea, maybe other ppl has got this problem 2??
However, if you wanne use TypeSend; (when you haven&#39;t got any problems with it ofcource :)) you just change &quot;SendText&quot; into &quot;TypeSend&quot; and change the &quot;TypeByte(13);&quot; that comes after it in every msg procedure.
I hope you guys read this before posting things like: &quot;Use typeSend noob, it&#39;s a lot og better.&quot; :D

Have fun and post comments/bugs/proggys...
