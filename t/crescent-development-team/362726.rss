A little about us
[left]To begin, Crescent is a very professional group. We strive to do our best in everything we do and expect that out of everyone that works with us, but at the same time we like to enjoy ourselves.  This project has been around for about 1 month now and we are taking our first steps into hiring.[/left]


About the server
The server we will be working on is a 508/525 base that will need a little work. Our goal in making this server is to have a *PERFECT* economy with a *PERFECT* pking system and have atleast 200 people on at all times. There will not be any commands for any players because we believe that it ruins the economy. There isn&#39;t to much to say about the server now considering it is just a 508/525 base and that it is needing work.
Later on when work is finished there will be a domain name and a ded.We are also looking for someone who knows GFX and is good at doing it. If you are wanting to apply for a server coder you must know how to code a 508. 

About the website
We arent looking to rip off Runescape&#39;s website, so please don&#39;t come in here telling me your an amazing web devo and try to set up the old gui of RS. 
We are looking for creativity. We want someone who will put time and effort into it. That is what draws people to the website more, is when it looks good. If you are wanting to apply for a website devo you must know php and be able to work in joomla.

Who we are looking for
We are looking for someone who is willing to work 15-20 hours a week. You must be able to work under a little bit of pressure at certain times, you must always have a good attitude. If everyone is in a good mood than it will create a better working environment. We would like you to be at least 15 years old or older. We can make exceptions though.

<p>[center][size=36pt]W[/size][size=14pt]elcome Moparscape. [/size][/center]</p>
<p>A little about us<br>
[left]To begin, Crescent is a very professional group. We strive to do our best in everything we do and expect that out of everyone that works with us, but at the same time we like to enjoy ourselves.  This project has been around for about 1 month now and we are taking our first steps into hiring.[/left]</p>
<p>About the server<br>
The server we will be working on is a 508/525 base that will need a little work. Our goal in making this server is to have a <em>PERFECT</em> economy with a <em>PERFECT</em> pking system and have atleast 200 people on at all times. There will not be any commands for any players because we believe that it ruins the economy. There isn’t to much to say about the server now considering it is just a 508/525 base and that it is needing work.<br>
Later on when work is finished there will be a domain name and a ded.We are also looking for someone who knows GFX and is good at doing it. If you are wanting to apply for a server coder you must know how to code a 508.</p>
<p>About the website<br>
We arent looking to rip off Runescape’s website, so please don’t come in here telling me your an amazing web devo and try to set up the old gui of RS.<br>
We are looking for creativity. We want someone who will put time and effort into it. That is what draws people to the website more, is when it looks good. If you are wanting to apply for a website devo you must know php and be able to work in joomla.</p>
<p>Who we are looking for<br>
We are looking for someone who is willing to work 15-20 hours a week. You must be able to work under a little bit of pressure at certain times, you must always have a good attitude. If everyone is in a good mood than it will create a better working environment. We would like you to be at least 15 years old or older. We can make exceptions though.</p>
