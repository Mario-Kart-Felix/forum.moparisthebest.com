    <title>Restart server with command?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/restart-server-with-command/356501</link>
    <description>I know there&#39;s a ::update command, but all that does is disconnect the players and denies all connections until the server is manually restarted.
Is there anyway to make it restart the server by itself when the timer runs down?
This would be very convenient because I help code my friends server and we constantly need to restart the server when I&#39;m making new content, and it would be great if I could do it without the host needing to be online and active.
Running a delta (I don&#39;t wanna hear it...) base server on a 317.</description>
