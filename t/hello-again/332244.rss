    <title>Hello Again</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hello-again/332244</link>
    <description>Hello again guys, 3 months after I was banned, I&#39;m coming back. (Not to stay, just to make this post / browse around)

My old alias was: Goodbye RS, Hello RSPS

I was banned because someone else made an account called &quot;Goodbye RS, Hello RSPS_&quot; and some mod just supposed it was me and decided to ban me permantly. (Not cool by the way, check the IPs)

Don&#39;t mock me for making this statement, but MoparScape, of all truths and will, was the best RSPS programming website I&#39;ve ever visited. Compared to R0ne-Server (know it all zone) and RuneL0cus (idiot fest) this community seemed to be most mature.

Well now that I am IP banned from here, R0ne-Server for realeasing skillcape emotes, and Locus for crashing 2speced, I will be leaving the RSPS era for good.

There is no reason for me to continually developing servers if I cannot realease them anywhere, so without further adue, please enjoy my last release, a 525 as stable as Hyperion. Based off z508 - yes I know what you will say, it&#39;s very lag prone, and disconnects users randomly. I&#39;ve fixed that. I&#39;ve also converted the entire server&#39;s process to Graham&#39;s event managing framework, excluding packet processing (in which were meant to be in process in the first place, and ONLY them.)

Do whatever, ban me some more, IP ban me. I havn&#39;t done anything to be banned in the first place.

Goodbye RSPS, Hello LIFE.

<p>My old alias was: Goodbye RS, Hello RSPS</p>
<p>I was banned because someone else made an account called “Goodbye RS, Hello RSPS_” and some mod just supposed it was me and decided to ban me permantly. (Not cool by the way, check the IPs)</p>
<p>Don’t mock me for making this statement, but MoparScape, of all truths and will, was the best RSPS programming website I’ve ever visited. Compared to R0ne-Server (know it all zone) and RuneL0cus (idiot fest) this community seemed to be most mature.</p>
<p>Well now that I am IP banned from here, R0ne-Server for realeasing skillcape emotes, and Locus for crashing 2speced, I will be leaving the RSPS era for good.</p>
<p>There is no reason for me to continually developing servers if I cannot realease them anywhere, so without further adue, please enjoy my last release, a 525 as stable as Hyperion. Based off z508 - yes I know what you will say, it’s very lag prone, and disconnects users randomly. I’ve fixed that. I’ve also converted the entire server’s process to Graham’s event managing framework, excluding packet processing (in which were meant to be in process in the first place, and ONLY them.)</p>
<p>Do whatever, ban me some more, IP ban me. I havn’t done anything to be banned in the first place.</p>
<p>Goodbye RSPS, Hello LIFE.</p>
