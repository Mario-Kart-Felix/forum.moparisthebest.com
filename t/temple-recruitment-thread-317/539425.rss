Let&#39;s begin with some clarification on what we mean by goals.


A goal is a game-state that we, our Developers strive to achieve in order to obtain a better game play or gaming environments.
However, a goal is the end of a certain progression. Temple-Network comes with multiples games projects like Gunz, Runescape private server and MTA. We (Vocab and Maxxe) are real life friends which recently started this project after a long discussion about other servers.
We both agreed on the fact that many, not to say alot of Gaming community provide bad customer support (Obliviously, our players are our customers) and such horrible gaming experience!
Our network will be developed with the goal of having a complete wide assortment of games (casual, competitive, or social. We try our best to accommodate the needs of all gamers and make sure our players gets a good experience playing our games).
T-N hopes to expand, it would be impossible to do so without planning and organization.
