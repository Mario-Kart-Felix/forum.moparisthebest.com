Hello I’m Vocab, first of all I would like to thank you for reading my post. As I realised video games are getting more and more boring not to say over-rated!<br>
The reality is that you have about five seconds to make a first good impression in most situations, Even in real life!<br>
Since there’s no rewind button to undo a false start, i won’t blow this opportunity to cement the perfect image of Temple-Network.<br>
However, I don’t want to forget my journey through many games over the years. So today I’m happy to announce that Temple-Network Will open his doors to the public.<br>
Temple-Network will strives on his Staff knowledge, common goals and organization. We are planning on building multiples games, including Gunz The Duel, RuneScape private server and MTA roleplay.<br>
To acheive our goals, We need every helping hands, so if you are a scripter of any kind or just a modeler and are interested in our projects which will bring solids benefits, good co-workers and organization…<br>
Temple-Network is your home!</p>
<p>So anyone with 3D modeling, texturing, Map Editing, Coding, Web Development or graphic design skills are welcome to apply to join our team to contribute!</p>
<p><img src="http://i476.photobucket.com/albums/rr129/ranchief2/goal_zpsa4a27b9c.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Let’s begin with some clarification on what we mean by goals.</p>
<p>A goal is a game-state that we, our Developers strive to achieve in order to obtain a better game play or gaming environments.<br>
However, a goal is the end of a certain progression. Temple-Network comes with multiples games projects like Gunz, Runescape private server and MTA. We (Vocab and Maxxe) are real life friends which recently started this project after a long discussion about other servers.<br>
We both agreed on the fact that many, not to say alot of Gaming community provide bad customer support (Obliviously, our players are our customers) and such horrible gaming experience!<br>
Our network will be developed with the goal of having a complete wide assortment of games (casual, competitive, or social. We try our best to accommodate the needs of all gamers and make sure our players gets a good experience playing our games).<br>
T-N hopes to expand, it would be impossible to do so without planning and organization.</p>
