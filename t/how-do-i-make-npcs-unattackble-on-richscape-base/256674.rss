    <description>wel atm i use richscape not really used to the base, But still find it good but however how do i make npcs unattackble
because on most other servers you have to go to npc.cfg and look up the npc and change it&#39;s health to 0 but when i did that i cant attack him and he attacks me with full power, By that i mean he hits massive man hits about 1-30.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 15, 2009, 03:57:26 pm[/size][hr]nvm- leave it, removed it since no one is going to post anyway :cool:</description>
