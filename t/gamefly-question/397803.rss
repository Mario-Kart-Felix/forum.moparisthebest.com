    <description>If I signup for the Gamefly free trial will they charge me?



&lt;blockquote&gt;We may offer free trials, trial memberships, and discount introductory offers of the Service to allow customers to become familiar with the many benefits of the subscription plans we offer. These trials and introductory offers are available to new (first-time) customers only, limited to one per household, and cannot be combined with any other offer. These limited trials and introductory offers are only valid in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia. A valid credit card is required. WE AUTHORIZE THE CARD UP TO THE AMOUNT OF ONE MONTHLY FEE IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE ACCOUNT. We receive no money from this transaction, even if your bank or credit card company temporarily holds the funds in your account.

We will begin billing your credit card for a monthly subscription fee (plus any applicable taxes) on the first day following the end of your trial or introductory offer period. YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR TRIAL OR INTRODUCTORY OFFER PERIOD TO AVOID HAVING YOUR CREDIT CARD CHARGED.

During a free trial or trial membership period, customers will not be eligible to receive free shipping on used game purchases and will not accrue GameFly Rewards.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>True, I try out games I would never think to playing and some actually impress. I tried Elder Scrolls for the first time and realized I was no-lifing for the entire week.</p>
