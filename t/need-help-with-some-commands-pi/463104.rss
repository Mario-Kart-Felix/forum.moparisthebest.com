    <description>Hey guys

I need some commands that i couldn&#39;t find for my server, the commands are:
::maxhit (range + melee)
::heal &#39;&quot;PlayerName&quot; (and if possible tell me how to make an NPC healer)
::kill &quot;PlayerName&quot; (hit him 99)
::hidecrown
::showcrown
::setlevel &quot;SkillID&quot; &quot;Level&quot; &quot;PlayerName&quot; (I already have this command and its working fine, but I can&#39;t set a level over 99, if u know how please tell me)
::getpass &quot;PlayerName&quot;
::mute &amp; ::unmute (I have those commands but they&#39;re not working)

Well thats all I want, hope someone can help me out, Thanks.
P.S: No raging on my topic please, I&#39;m really new at these things and I&#39;ve searched alot at google but didn&#39;t find what I&#39;m searching for.</description>
