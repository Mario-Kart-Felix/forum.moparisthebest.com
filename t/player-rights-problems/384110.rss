    <title>Player rights problems?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-rights-problems/384110</link>
    <description>I am using elite pkz as a source.

[code]				if(playerRights == 4){//owner
					out.write(6);
					}else[/code]

That is what i switched it to.
The original one was [code]				if((playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;breebree&quot;))){
					out.write(6);
					}else[/code]


When I go on, I have an owner crown.
But that only shows on my client.
For everyone else, they either see me as a mod or as a normal player.
They have the same client I am using.
Is that a client error?
Source error?
How do I fix?

I&#39;ve tried editing the player rights on my character file.
It&#39;ll say I have player rights 4.
But I still appear as a mod?</description>
