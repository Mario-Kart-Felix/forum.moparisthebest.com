    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eversomepk-should-be-banned-from-mopar-please-read/372776</link>
    <description>Hi. I just wanted to point out that this kid should be banned from Moparscape, as well as the Server Status Page, please take time to read his post on my forums and read the rest of the information in this post, and please comment about it.

This is a post he has made on my forums, 3 times.
http://foreverpkers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=230

Here&#39;s plain text of what he wrote, if you don&#39;t wish to visit the link.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hello,

As many of you know, me and Jimmy do not get along. I&#39;ll explain the reasons here, and the consequence for his actions against me. Okay, well let&#39;s start. When I was re-promoted to an administrator, some fail user said that I stole his $100 donation. Firstly, the kid was from Amsterdam, and you can&#39;t trust half of those fags. Secondly, he didn&#39;t even speak proper English, and all of you players know how big of a grammar Nazi I am. I was angry, and reacted inappropriately by deleting your character files. I did have a backup, and that&#39;s how I was cracking all of the passes. For example, Black Rave84. I decrypted his password, and gave it to a friend, R00t, who then did the work for me(He owns a private VPN, I do not). Jimmy decided to down vote my server, and to stop this, I will be acting inappropriately a second time.

In addition to the spamming my staff has been doing, we&#39;ll be flooding the VPS and website with packets. The EXACT dates are confidential, and times will vary. We plan on having a major take-down, and dropping ForeverPker&#39;s site to the ground, just to stop this down voting. Many of you do not know what Team EPKay is capable of. We&#39;ve been conducting small floods, but are expecting a flood from 1.2K PRIVATE shells, and over 4K public shells. We&#39;ve purchased a $90 Dedicated Server just for this from Scorpio. Link to our yummy booter: *remove*
We&#39;ve added a PhP login script to protect the public from using our shells.

Here&#39;s some information:
ForeverPkers is gone. This flood will take them down. Jimmy is so jealous of us, he relinked the Vote4Cash to down vote us. Did anyone notice that? I, myself, do not want to harm the community of ForeverPkers. It&#39;s just, the owner, James Akins, is a real pain in the ass, and worsens my life day by day. Yes, I am bipolar, and I handle my emotions in the worst ways, and when my energy level is low, he hits at me. Here are some MSN logs:

READ POST 2 THEN RETURN HERE!!

Are you finally convinced of this kid? He&#39;s constantly flaming me, and making it harder for me to deal with my disease. I dislike others being angry with me, and my actions are all uncontrollable when it comes to anger. He SPECIFICALLY stated giving back the donations back would be hell. A few hours before, I decided to test his greediness. He wouldn&#39;t even give me $13 to pay for my web-hosting(I own several giant game sites). I made him $356 in donators my first week, and introduced him to Google AdSense, where he currently makes an easy $15.00/day. You&#39;re now more than likely convinced this guy is in it for the money.

Anyways,

*remove*&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Okay, so I&#39;ve been voting DOWN his server due to the constant spam on ForeverPkers, in which he took too far by spamming for hours on 3 accounts at once, with no one online to do anything about it. He&#39;s playing the RSPS game very unfairly. In all honestly I&#39;ve never spammed any server to join mine for any reason, it&#39;s pointless, disrespectful, and idiotic.

Okay so part 2 of what he did to me. A few months ago he redirected my Webclient to his to get players, also using my exact source and character files..

A month ago, he erased all of my character files

He&#39;s making constant threats to DDoS me which is illegal and annoying as fuck, only because I know he has no idea what he&#39;s talking about

He&#39;s constantly trying to fuck me over and get my players because he can&#39;t make a quality server/website and can&#39;t maintain a player base

Anyways, post what you think about this kid, and if you read his post, you can obviously tell he&#39;s a dumbass from the beginning.
And if you&#39;re going to leave a comment that says &quot;Stupid kid trying to get someone banned noob gtfo&quot; don&#39;t waste your time, I&#39;ll just ignore it, I just want to get the word around about this kid.

              <p>Hi. I just wanted to point out that this kid should be banned from Moparscape, as well as the Server Status Page, please take time to read his post on my forums and read the rest of the information in this post, and please comment about it.</p>
<p>This is a post he has made on my forums, 3 times.<br>
<a href="http://foreverpkers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=230" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://foreverpkers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=230</a></p>
<p>Here’s plain text of what he wrote, if you don’t wish to visit the link.</p>
<blockquote>Hello,
<p>As many of you know, me and Jimmy do not get along. I’ll explain the reasons here, and the consequence for his actions against me. Okay, well let’s start. When I was re-promoted to an administrator, some fail user said that I stole his $100 donation. Firstly, the kid was from Amsterdam, and you can’t trust half of those fags. Secondly, he didn’t even speak proper English, and all of you players know how big of a grammar Nazi I am. I was angry, and reacted inappropriately by deleting your character files. I did have a backup, and that’s how I was cracking all of the passes. For example, Black Rave84. I decrypted his password, and gave it to a friend, R00t, who then did the work for me(He owns a private VPN, I do not). Jimmy decided to down vote my server, and to stop this, I will be acting inappropriately a second time.</p>
<p>In addition to the spamming my staff has been doing, we’ll be flooding the VPS and website with packets. The EXACT dates are confidential, and times will vary. We plan on having a major take-down, and dropping ForeverPker’s site to the ground, just to stop this down voting. Many of you do not know what Team EPKay is capable of. We’ve been conducting small floods, but are expecting a flood from 1.2K PRIVATE shells, and over 4K public shells. We’ve purchased a $90 Dedicated Server just for this from Scorpio. Link to our yummy booter: <em>remove</em><br>
We’ve added a PhP login script to protect the public from using our shells.</p>
<p>Here’s some information:<br>
ForeverPkers is gone. This flood will take them down. Jimmy is so jealous of us, he relinked the Vote4Cash to down vote us. Did anyone notice that? I, myself, do not want to harm the community of ForeverPkers. It’s just, the owner, James Akins, is a real pain in the ass, and worsens my life day by day. Yes, I am bipolar, and I handle my emotions in the worst ways, and when my energy level is low, he hits at me. Here are some MSN logs:</p>
<p>READ POST 2 THEN RETURN HERE!!</p>
<p>Are you finally convinced of this kid? He’s constantly flaming me, and making it harder for me to deal with my disease. I dislike others being angry with me, and my actions are all uncontrollable when it comes to anger. He SPECIFICALLY stated giving back the donations back would be hell. A few hours before, I decided to test his greediness. He wouldn’t even give me $13 to pay for my web-hosting(I own several giant game sites). I made him $356 in donators my first week, and introduced him to Google AdSense, where he currently makes an easy $15.00/day. You’re now more than likely convinced this guy is in it for the money.</p>
<p>Anyways,</p>
<p><em>remove</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so I’ve been voting DOWN his server due to the constant spam on ForeverPkers, in which he took too far by spamming for hours on 3 accounts at once, with no one online to do anything about it. He’s playing the RSPS game very unfairly. In all honestly I’ve never spammed any server to join mine for any reason, it’s pointless, disrespectful, and idiotic.</p>
<p>Okay so part 2 of what he did to me. A few months ago he redirected my Webclient to his to get players, also using my exact source and character files…</p>
<p>A month ago, he erased all of my character files</p>
<p>He’s making constant threats to DDoS me which is illegal and annoying as fuck, only because I know he has no idea what he’s talking about</p>
<p>He’s constantly trying to fuck me over and get my players because he can’t make a quality server/website and can’t maintain a player base</p>
<p>Anyways, post what you think about this kid, and if you read his post, you can obviously tell he’s a dumbass from the beginning.<br>
And if you’re going to leave a comment that says “Stupid kid trying to get someone banned noob gtfo” don’t waste your time, I’ll just ignore it, I just want to get the word around about this kid.</p>
<p>Mopar Username is “Penetration”</p>
