24/7 VPS with 4gb ram

100% Shops fixed price and etc.
-Almost 100% SOF added (other than the common cache problem with the images screwing up), Stuff like &quot;You recieved (items name)&quot;, All working Rarities.
-All Dominion Glove Specials Work (Golitath, Spellcasters and Swifts)
-Full GWD (Including Nex and Nex Drops the new Nex Boots and Gloves!)
-KING BLACK DRAGON JUST LIKE RUNESCAPE (You will love this feature)
-Perfect Theiving, with delay and sides.
-New Saradomin Amulets (Whisper, Murmur and Hiss) and Godwars Items (Bandos helmet, Bandos Gloves, Bandos Boots, Armadyl&#39;s Crossbow, Armadyl&#39;s Buckler
-Ranks: Mod, Admin, Owner, Donator, Extreme Donator and Helper (With all unique crowns!)
-Revenants and Glacors with working Drops (Pvp Armours for Revs) (Glaivens, Steadfasts and Ragefire Boots for Glacors)
-Custom loyalty program with loyalty shop (Every 30 minutes players get a notification in the chat box that they receive 250 Loyalty points.)
-Custom Quest Tab, Skills tele, monster tele, etc.
-All 735+ Monsters such as Nex, Godwars, All of that good stuff (with 100% working NEW coords for Godwars Plus 100% Working Godwar altars.)
-It has some fixed Mod, Admin and Owner crowns. (Use a cache Editor to change them)
-718 Drop Editor
-An Eco-Reset Batch file
-Xteas are phenomenal, only very few places are missing
-Home is at pest control
-Pvp System with Pvp shop
-A completely CUSTOM Ganodermic shop (Kill Gano Beasts for flakes and turn them in as a reward with the Ogre trader for equipment)
-Announcement when Owner signs on (for you self centered coders, just change the name from ben to whatever your owner name will be)
And now my favorite feature/features would be logs. Yes, logs. I have added chat logs for ANY player (staff or not). Command logs (For all ranks). Ip logs (to keep an eye on your &quot;trusted&quot; players more closely). And Trade logs (Not Fully Fixed but works)</description>
