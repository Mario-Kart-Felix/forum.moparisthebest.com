    <title>Converting php to js</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/converting-php-to-js/373229</link>
    <description>yes i know php is server-side script and javascript is client-side. im wanting to convert a piece of open-source php software to javascript. the original software i havent looked through but i think i can convert most of it to js--loops, sql, conditions, functions, etc... 

What i think i may have trouble with is reading/writing files, request and such. i was wondering how much trouble im going to have doing this. i plan on releasing it as a chrome application that can be used offline when/if i finish it.

the software is eyeos. i thought i would be possible to do this. is there a place i should start? i was thinking i should just start where it seems like it initiates and work my way through it. i thought this would be useful; at least to me.

i learned about websql so i thought i could use that in place of mysql in the php and some other things to make it work; but since i havent looked at any of the code idk if i will be able to--thinking if i have to write files then i can use localstorage right?

i wont be able to work on it much this week since this is finals week and i have assignments i need to get done--kind of a lie; i wont have time, but i probably wont do my work, so in the end i will have the time. i also have other things i want to do for the chrome OS if google doesnt make them.</description>
