    <description>Hi everyone who&#39;s reading this post my name is rilind and i whant to make a software in visual bassics that works like this:
-first it gives you a option on what kind of server you want to make example 317, 508,...
-then it gives you a list with all kinds of source files (servers)
-then it asks you your name of your server (so it edits the name of your server in the log in screen welcome screen,...)
-then it asks you your owner account name and adds him the commands to do ::admin ::mod and all the others
-then it asks you your ip address so it adds on the client
-then it autouploads the cache file (zip,rar) onto a website and adds that link into your client.java
-then it compiles the client and it makes it into a jar file

THATS HOW I Want IT TO BE BUT I&#39;M STILL WORKING ON IT AND ITS GOING TO BE A VERY HARD THINK TO DO SO DON&#39;T EXPECT THIS TO BE ALREADY THERE! if you whant to help me ocntact me
