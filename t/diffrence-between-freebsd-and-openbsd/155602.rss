    <title>Diffrence between FreeBSD and openBSD</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/diffrence-between-freebsd-and-openbsd/155602</link>
    <description>I have been really keen on using openBSD. But I would like to know what is the difference between openBSD and freeBSD.

That includes:

- Packages
- [s]Support/Documentation[/s]
They both offer great documentation.</description>
