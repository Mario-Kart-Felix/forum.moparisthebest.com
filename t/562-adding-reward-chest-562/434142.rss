    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-adding-reward-chest-562/434142</link>
    <description>[b]this is an tutorial on how to add a reward chest (for donators or vote rewards, etc.)

first of all i want to say this isn&#39;t my work im just adding it on moparscape, so all credits to who ever made this.

i have tested it on a 562, and i like it so thats why i add it on here.

the only thing you have to do is open your object1packethandler.java, and add this:[/b]

[code]case 104:
		int [] gifts = {1050, 1038, 1040, 1042, 1044, 1046, 1048, 113, 114, 995, 1540, 995, 995, 995, 995, 995, 995, 1540, 995, 995, 

995, 995, 995, 1540, 995, 995, 995, 995, 995, 1540, 995, 995, 995, 995, 995, 1540, 995, 995, 995, 995, 995, 1540, 995, 995, 995, 995, 995, 

1540, 995, 995, 995, 995, 995, 1540, 995, 995, 995, 995}; //Rares and A LOT of random crap
		int i = Misc.random(60);
		if(player.getInventory().contains(1464)){
		player.getInventory().deleteItem(1464, 1);
		player.getInventory().addItem(gifts[i], 1);
		player.sm(&quot;Have fun with your new item!&quot;);
		} else {
		player.sm(&quot;You need a ticket to search this chest!&quot;);
		player.sm(&quot;Tickets are rewards from admins for being active!&quot;);
		}
	break;[/code]

[b]explaining the code above: 
the &#39;case 104:&#39; is the object ID you can change to whatever you want

the &#39;int [] gifts = {1050, 1038, ..... 995, 995}; //Rares and A LOT of random crap&#39; are the rewards u can just change that to whatever you want, the cash is added for less change to rares

if(player.getInventory().contains(1464)){
player.getInventory().deleteItem(1464, 1);
player.getInventory().addItem(gifts[i], 1);
player.sm(&quot;Have fun with your new item!&quot;);     means that you need the item 1464 (archery ticket) to open the chest, that you get 1 of the gifts and deletes one ticket, and gives a message feel free to change the message.

player.sm(&quot;You need a ticket to search this chest!&quot;);
player.sm(&quot;fill in how to earn tickets on your server!&quot;); this means you dont have a ticket and how to get them.

this is all you have to do, hope you guys liked it, have fun :)[/b]</description>
