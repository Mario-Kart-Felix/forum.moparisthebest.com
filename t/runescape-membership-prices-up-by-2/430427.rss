    <title>Runescape membership prices up by $2</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-membership-prices-up-by-2/430427</link>
    <description>It was eminent with all the loss they had from removing bots. my question is does it mean that If you have an account that has ever been a member than it will continue to have the current price of $5.95? b/c I have 1 account that has had membership for over a year a couple years ago. and another that has been a member probably 4 months b4. both currently arent a member since i dont play enough. so on those accounts will it only cost $5.95?

From my understanding of what they wrote this is correct. I just dont want to pay more than i have to.</description>

Not sure what’s going on, but I just paid $5.95 for membership. Am I missing something? They rose it by $1 for credit card users, and something like $2 for paypal users.<br>

They are going to raise it on the first of the month for new users, but if you have ever had a subscription on an account your signing up on it will only cost the original like 5.95 or something like that.[/quote]</p>
<p>It has to be continually recurring from before the price raise. If you let it slip up then you pay the new price. I still pay $4.95 from a few years ago, so lets hope I never slip</p>
<p>Woops they allow a 7 day grace period if you do slip</p>

              <p>Um the actual price for US citizens is 5.95 up until February then it will be 7.95 I remember very clear that the price has been 5.95 for quite sometime but original price was 5$ until they wanted more money which increased it to 5.95 now they want more money so they are raising the prices yet again to 7.95.</p>

              <p>maybe. they were supposed to be doing some more stuff for f2p which they have. f2p is like 1%(not the actually % it maybe a little higher but it seems like it; i would have to do a ton of research just to figure out the actual %) of what p2p can do… if they increased it to like 5% it would make it nicer. I have a lvl 90 main with lvl 60+ in most of my stats and lvling up skill as f2p just isnt any fun. I actually kinda appreciate them removing bots even though i was a botter(not on my main, may main is purely played by me; but all my noob accounts I botted on). the reason why is when I was wcing just for the heck of it it was kinda nice to be able to talk to actually ppl while you chopped yews. Does mopar have a thread about community f2p activities? I think that might make the game a little more fun if a couple of us f2p skilled, pvp in cw, or did dungeoneering together or something.</p>

              <p>ya I was thinking about buying membership but most of the time I only get on half the days of the month and only play a couple hours when I do play do im thinking it wouldnt be a good for me to buy membership just to keep the $5.95. if they locked the price in for anyone that was a previous member i would buy a membership for one of my accounts but since that isnt the case it would be a waste of money for me. If they add some cool things I will look at buying a membership then but at the moment I still need to buy MC. also im not to happy with them taking the high scores away from f2p… that was absolutely unnecessary.</p>

<p>So if you pay by Sms/Paypal whats the situation? Cause I don’t do reoccurring cause most of the time I just pay Rsgp for members. I know someone answered it but I don’t really understand what there saying.</p>

</aside>
<p>paypal is the cheaper way. sms is a pretty high price. what do u mean by situation? all you have to do is cancel your membership within a day or so if you only plan on being a member for a month. its the cheapest option, so unless you can’t pay by credit card then there isnt a reason why not to take that option.</p>
