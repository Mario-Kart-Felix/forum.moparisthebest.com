    <description>Hi guys, me again.

Just found a VERY annoying bug.

Almost every time someone teleports to the same place as you, you can&#39;t see them but they can&#39;t see you, this is not helpful as I am making a pkbox and people will not be able to see eachother D:

Thanks for your time.</description>
