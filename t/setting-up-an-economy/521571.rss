    <title>Setting up an economy?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-up-an-economy/521571</link>
    <description>Now I want my server to be a pk/economy server, but I&#39;m not sure my economy is that great. 

Monster Drops:
Frost Dragons-Dragon plate, Ava&#39;s accumulator, dragon boots, lamp(for xp skill), dfs, and clue scrolls
Jad and his minions-fire cape, clue scrolls, and other Jad equipment
Ice Queen, Kalphite Guardian, and gorilla(warrior guy?)-ring of wealth(works),parts of crystal keys, clue scrolls
Nezikchened-same as above but plus amulet of fury, clue scroll
god wars bosses-godswords, bandos armor, saradomin sword, armadyl range armor, clue scroll
tds-dkite shield
mole-range boots and robin hat, clue scroll, death cape
chaos elemental-drops what ever, but really hard to kill and is at level 55 wildy
elf warriors-didn&#39;t change their drops
kbd-dfs, clue scrolls
Barreclchest Guardian-statius armor,morgins, and zuriels armor-they are hard too kill...you can get about 5 kills before you bank
corporal beat-spirit shield and spirit cape, clue scrolls
kalphite queen-lava whip and lava armor, clue scrolls
daggonath kings-rings such as warrior&#39;s ring, and dhachet, clue scrolls
barrows-barrows armor

PkShop:
Whips, torva, rocktail, exc

dungeoneering shop:
chaotics

noncombat:
well you can make money off of mining and thieving such as once you hit 90 thieving and thieve off of gem stalls you can make 50k per a thieve and smithing runite bars you make 50k. The third way is fishing and you make only a fourth of the price of the fish, for example a fish cost 400gp, when you fish it you get the fish and 100gp.

I made it where you spend alot on non-combat skills such as herblore and runecrafting, but also made it where you have to actually go get your whips and dbows.

I just want too know what you guys think of my economy?  What does your server have for its economy?</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>The best way to hit off an economical system in a private server is not making players adapt to your server, but make your server adapt to them. In order to do this, you could create a system that logs which monsters are being killed, and what those monsters are dropping. With that data, you could determine which drop rates need to be changed. There is not going to be any solid path for creating a balanced economy, because people are different and have different opinions. Someone might like to join a server in hopes of spawning items and pvping, or leveling up really fast and getting good drops every hour. The sad fact about creating an economy in private servers is that a lot of people aren’t willing to be dedicated to that server, especially if the general population/player activity is low. From personal experience, I would not spend hours upon hours killing a boss in a private server that has any less than 50 players, if that.</p>

<p>I already made the starter pack like that  ;D and for shops made one shop with some rares to get the economy running and another shop for some basic pk supplies but I’m thinking about lowering the number of potions because they are always used when I watch pk vids</p>

For example, I had an npc flower gambler that <span class="bbcode-b">could</span> give a chance to do a  2.5 times the amount increase of whatever you bet. HOWEVER, it was only like a 25% chance of winning. Because of this most of the time gold went out. It was “just enough” though that people would try it. I was doing 4x the gold at first but I found that wins were still too often.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Elrick, post:12, topic:521571”]My suggestion would be to give a boosted xp rate at the beginning of the server, get the eco started and whatnot. Once you have players and a started eco, begin to decrease drop rates secretly, and lower the xp rate back to the original intended. It’s like nurturing a baby giraffe to get it to stand on all fours and get it moving around, then once it begins stability you allow it to begin its own course without all of the cushion it started with.</p>
<p>If item influx is still an issue, up the store price so people will sell it, then create a gold sink to start to move it back out. Jagex almost had the right idea with construction, barrows, and DG so be sure to find a way to get that influx out of the system via non-dropped items such as slayer gear and others.</p>
<p>This is just my idea and tbh I have no proof to back up what I think, so I would actually love criticism on what I think to see whether I may be right, or if I’m just a bafoon :p.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks but to let you guys know drop rates on rare items are pretty low…For really rare items it might be between 10-1 out of 1000, so its not that easy to obtain all these items besides clue scrolls which have 3 different kinds, yet don’t know what I should put them at. and the Crystal keys are pretty easy to get since they are only used to get trim, third age, and god armor such as saradomin, zammy, and guthix(rune) armor.  I have a voting shop but I don’t want to open during the beta just yet. Probly what makes my drops easy is that the ring of wealth plays a enormous factor, but with out a ring of wealth drop rates make it hard for players to get items fast…you see what I’m saying?</p>
<p>[quote=“Loveandpower, post:13, topic:521571”]The only issue I see with lowering xp rates is that people will notice overtime what you did. I don’t suggest this as it will cause drama.</p>

<p>Thats a great idea but isn’t the eco drainer the items that people want from other players?</p>

              <p>My suggestion would be to give a boosted xp rate at the beginning of the server, get the eco started and whatnot. Once you have players and a started eco, begin to decrease drop rates secretly, and lower the xp rate back to the original intended. It’s like nurturing a baby giraffe to get it to stand on all fours and get it moving around, then once it begins stability you allow it to begin its own course without all of the cushion it started with.</p>
<p>If item influx is still an issue, up the store price so people will sell it, then create a gold sink to start to move it back out. Jagex almost had the right idea with construction, barrows, and DG so be sure to find a way to get that influx out of the system via non-dropped items such as slayer gear and others.</p>
<p>This is just my idea and tbh I have no proof to back up what I think, so I would actually love criticism on what I think to see whether I may be right, or if I’m just a bafoon :p.</p>

              <p>i didn’t read all of it, only the first couple of sentences. what i’m trying to suggest is, make the rare items hard to get, but add other items in drops to motivate people, as a sort of secondary-rare if that makes sense?</p>
<p>you won’t run out of items, because these will be hard to get, but not as hard. the RS item database is also quite large, i’m sure people can use any/if not all the items for something. e.g a key; which can be used for opening a dungeon door to access more bosses. the process is everlasting.</p>
<p>you would also need a large enough player base for all the items to be used or w/e, not even SoulSplit can accomplish this.</p>

<p>[quote]<span class="bbcode-b"></span>I am tired of people trying to act like they know what a real economy is without having lived in it. Therefore, here is a rough outlook on how an economy is really done on servers, why it fails, and how it can be improved upon.</p>
<p>If you can find ways to improve it even more feel free to post!</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a leeched server. This server had all the really great features that even this server somewhat relates to. Good/bad ? Who cares!</p>
<p>There once was one player. This one player got on before several others did and got several stats(mostly combat of course!) up before everybody else. This person thus, started the economy when the time came.</p>
<p>The second and third person came on and saw these really cool items(weapons/armor most likely…) and were like “hey dude, that freaking thing is awesome! How much you want for it?”</p>
<p>The mighty warrior by this point laughs at the lesser being and says “you must train up to even use this little grasshopper!” "I tell you what though, this is a genuine, only one of a kind item in the server! I will let you have it for .</p>
<p>The little newbie says “lol I don’t have that much sorry…”</p>
<p>The mighty warrior says “That’s okay mate work up you will have it soon.”</p>
<p>The little newbie says “How can I make money on this server?”</p>
<p>The mighty warrior grins thinking he is helping a new player! “We have several ways of making money I suggest thieving and PvM!”</p>
<p>“Gee thanks Mr. strong guy in dragon full helm!”</p>
<p>So two days later, we have a level 85 slayer who is going for a whip, a skiller who is dead set on staying"level three", three guys camping td’s trying to get “dem claws”, and one guy who is going “ANYBODY WANNA PK, OMG THIS SERVER SUCKS NOBODY WANTS TO PK!”</p>
<p>Now, let’s take out the human factor of voting for now we will come back to this. We have ten people online, this means you can imagine that on the average server, we probably have AT LEAST 100m already in the game.</p>
<p>Then, one day the five more people join after seeing the shiny advertisement made for the server! Yay! More people to talk to! So now we have five more PvMer’s.</p>
<p>A week later you have people selling items for 500m-1b each.</p>
<p>WHAT loveING HAPPENED?</p>
<p>Simple answer: No Challenge!</p>
<p>Let’s rewind a couple of steps shall we? Before the five new PvMer’s came what was the main goal for the current players? To be the richest? To gain a certain item? To be the coolest?</p>
<p>You have three PvMer’s who on average will get a drop every 50-100 kills. If a kill takes a minute(just estimating of course) then that means it takes an hour and a half for one drop.</p>
<p>One drop x 4 = 6 hours of gameplay = a decent time to play in a day for the generic young person.</p>
<p>4 x 3 = 12 drops in a day, 12 x 7 = 72 drops that week.</p>
<p>By just assuming these drops were…let’s say PvP armor to keep it simple!</p>
<p>You have a hood, a top, a bottom, and a weapon right? That’s four pieces!</p>
<p>THAT IS 12 RANDOM VARIOUS PARTS OF OUTFITS FOR PvP armor.</p>
<p>But wait, there is more! How many people do you know who camps a boss? How many peopel do you know who plays on more than one account? How many people do you know who ACTUALLY ABUSE VOTES!</p>
<p>[Chapter 2:]</p>
<p>I believe you get the overall picture I am drawing…every day more people will join, with that comes dupers, abusers, xloggers, toucgh noogies, and etc.</p>
<p>What are the consequences of this massive overdose of items entering the eco?</p>
<p>-People quit<br>
-People rage<br>
-People want to make it easier so they can have the same items<br>
-People want xp raised so they can get items faster<br>
-People want this<br>
-People want that<br>
The list goes on!</p>
<p>Sound familiar? It should , look at our suggestions board!</p>
<p>Items are coming in, nothing is going out. What comes first the chicken or the egg? I have a better question than that… who is going to eat that egg? You going to eat that chicken? Cause I am hungry I will take scrambled eggs yes please.</p>
<p>Okay so now you see the issue as to WHY it fails. You can say all you want “but gold is being transferred”</p>
<p>Yeah, and your just printing more and more of it by having gold from thieving and etc etc…DUDE!</p>
<p>[Chapter 3:]</p>
<p>What can be done about this?</p>
<p>-make items HARDER to get<br>
-Discontinue items<br>
-Increase drop rates<br>
-Put limits on how many times a monster can be done in a day<br>
-make EVERYTHING HARDER</p>
<p>I guess I should explain the reasoning in this.</p>
<p>From a marketing standpoint you have to keep players happy but at the same time you have to weigh the pros/cons of what makes them happy versus what that happiness will cost in the short end and the long end.</p>
<p>Other suggestions/thoughts:</p>
<p>-Make new content UNIQUE content. You need a piece of cake to draw people in but don’t make them clingers!<br>
-A server isn’t totally made up an eco, there is a human factor of “respect” as well.  Look at a very well known server that starts with an “s” for example.<br>
-Improve the environment for all forms of players not just the majority group of PvMer’s. Remember a eco is ran by the items supplied by the players not by the store(or it should be to be fully successful.) For example: look at Runescape. They have BASIC gear in the shops and then you go from there.<br>
-Keep in mind that you will lose some, and win some players. That’s where the respect comes in.<br>
-Advertising in the proper areas at the proper times is key. Ever seen servers such as the one that starts with “s”? They have advertisements everywhere!<br>
-Have a creative outlook. Don’t look at doing stuff like the regular game, but make your own ( which I can see you have been doing somewhat )</p>
<p>[Chapter 4:]</p>
<p>The extras!</p>
<p>Voting</p>
<p>I can see where voting is a huge part of a beginning server I really can. But when you have people who abuse a server it just hurts you more than helps. Going back to the example of the ratio of drops to players, now the reality of this heh…multiply that by 100 fold.</p>
<p>Where is a good place to start with voting? Maybe 30 minutes of a 2.5-5% increase in overall drop rates. Maybe a “double loot” 1% chance. Maybe a 10-15 minute xp boost.</p>
<p>Age of players</p>
<p>Uh yeah…let’s just be honest here okay? The average player will be about thirteen. Yeah so what are you saying? I am saying take their words at a grain of salt. You are the developer, you are the one responsible for building this server economy up! Not them! If you want the players to supply the eco correctly then you have to give them the bare necessities and don’t back down to quitting threats.[/quote][/quote]</p>
<p>although you and i both said to make EVERYTHING harder, this is also a bad idea as well. if your making everything harder, people are going to get bored and/or fed up very quickly. for instance, if a player is killing a boss for about 2-3 hours and gets nothing and nothing from any other boss there going to get annoyed and bored because they want these new items fast…therefore, they’re going to quit.</p>
<p>so…instead of making everything harder add a variety of items into the economy and not just the same old stuff. randomize it a bit, for example: bosses dropping caviliar’s, highwayman masks etcetera. this will keep them entertained and will satisfy the players needs it will also motivate them, wanting them to play on to get better items.</p>

<p>I believe you get the overall picture I am drawing…every day more people will join, with that comes dupers, abusers, xloggers, toucgh noogies, and etc.</p>
<p>What are the consequences of this massive overdose of items entering the eco?</p>
<p>-People quit<br>
-People rage<br>
-People want to make it easier so they can have the same items<br>
-People want xp raised so they can get items faster<br>
-People want this<br>
-People want that<br>
The list goes on!</p>
<p>Sound familiar? It should , look at our suggestions board!</p>
<p>Items are coming in, nothing is going out. What comes first the chicken or the egg? I have a better question than that… who is going to eat that egg? You going to eat that chicken? Cause I am hungry I will take scrambled eggs yes please.</p>
<p>Okay so now you see the issue as to WHY it fails. You can say all you want “but gold is being transferred”</p>
<p>Yeah, and your just printing more and more of it by having gold from thieving and etc etc…DUDE!</p>
<p>[Chapter 3:]</p>
<p>What can be done about this?</p>
<p>-make items HARDER to get<br>
-Discontinue items<br>
-Increase drop rates<br>
-Put limits on how many times a monster can be done in a day<br>
-make EVERYTHING HARDER</p>
<p>I guess I should explain the reasoning in this.</p>
<p>From a marketing standpoint you have to keep players happy but at the same time you have to weigh the pros/cons of what makes them happy versus what that happiness will cost in the short end and the long end.</p>
<p>Other suggestions/thoughts:</p>
<p>-Make new content UNIQUE content. You need a piece of cake to draw people in but don’t make them clingers!<br>
-A server isn’t totally made up an eco, there is a human factor of “respect” as well.  Look at a very well known server that starts with an “s” for example.<br>
-Improve the environment for all forms of players not just the majority group of PvMer’s. Remember a eco is ran by the items supplied by the players not by the store(or it should be to be fully successful.) For example: look at Runescape. They have BASIC gear in the shops and then you go from there.<br>
-Keep in mind that you will lose some, and win some players. That’s where the respect comes in.<br>
-Advertising in the proper areas at the proper times is key. Ever seen servers such as the one that starts with “s”? They have advertisements everywhere!<br>
-Have a creative outlook. Don’t look at doing stuff like the regular game, but make your own ( which I can see you have been doing somewhat )</p>
<p>[Chapter 4:]</p>
<p>The extras!</p>
<p>Voting</p>
<p>I can see where voting is a huge part of a beginning server I really can. But when you have people who abuse a server it just hurts you more than helps. Going back to the example of the ratio of drops to players, now the reality of this heh…multiply that by 100 fold.</p>
<p>Where is a good place to start with voting? Maybe 30 minutes of a 2.5-5% increase in overall drop rates. Maybe a “double loot” 1% chance. Maybe a 10-15 minute xp boost.</p>
<p>Age of players</p>
<p>Uh yeah…let’s just be honest here okay? The average player will be about thirteen. Yeah so what are you saying? I am saying take their words at a grain of salt. You are the developer, you are the one responsible for building this server economy up! Not them! If you want the players to supply the eco correctly then you have to give them the bare necessities and don’t back down to quitting threats.</p>

              <p>as far as i can see, your economy is going to be terrible. however, it all depends on your drop rates - how hard it is to get the rarer items and how much money/points you need for the rare items in the shops. so bare that in mind.</p>

              <p>Now I want my server to be a pk/economy server, but I’m not sure my economy is that great.</p>
<p>Monster Drops:<br>
Frost Dragons-Dragon plate, Ava’s accumulator, dragon boots, lamp(for xp skill), dfs, and clue scrolls<br>
Jad and his minions-fire cape, clue scrolls, and other Jad equipment<br>
Ice Queen, Kalphite Guardian, and gorilla(warrior guy?)-ring of wealth(works),parts of crystal keys, clue scrolls<br>
Nezikchened-same as above but plus amulet of fury, clue scroll<br>
god wars bosses-godswords, bandos armor, saradomin sword, armadyl range armor, clue scroll<br>
tds-dkite shield<br>
mole-range boots and robin hat, clue scroll, death cape<br>
chaos elemental-drops what ever, but really hard to kill and is at level 55 wildy<br>
elf warriors-didn’t change their drops<br>
kbd-dfs, clue scrolls<br>
Barreclchest Guardian-statius armor,morgins, and zuriels armor-they are hard too kill…you can get about 5 kills before you bank<br>

<p>PkShop:<br>
Whips, torva, rocktail, exc</p>
<p>dungeoneering shop:<br>
chaotics</p>
<p>noncombat:<br>
well you can make money off of mining and thieving such as once you hit 90 thieving and thieve off of gem stalls you can make 50k per a thieve and smithing runite bars you make 50k. The third way is fishing and you make only a fourth of the price of the fish, for example a fish cost 400gp, when you fish it you get the fish and 100gp.</p>
<p>I made it where you spend alot on non-combat skills such as herblore and runecrafting, but also made it where you have to actually go get your whips and dbows.</p>
<p>I just want too know what you guys think of my economy?  What does your server have for its economy?</p>
