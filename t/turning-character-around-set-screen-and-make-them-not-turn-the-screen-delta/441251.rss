    <title>Turning character around, set screen and make them not turn the screen [Delta]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/turning-character-around-set-screen-and-make-them-not-turn-the-screen-delta/441251</link>
    <description>[s]I&#39;m wondering how to point a character a special way, (i.e the face points north, south, etc)[/s]
And how to point their screen to north and make it so they can&#39;t turn the screen.

I&#39;m using Delta as stated in the title :)

Alright, I found out how to point the character, now I just need to know how to lock the screen to north.</description>
