<p>“Stealing Players”?</p>
<p>If you think you “own” players, Think again. People do what they want. If they come to lets say RSC-Live, and like it better than that server RSCE or whatever, That’s their choice. Try and stop us from spreading the word. I’ve been accused of alot of things by luke. To be completely honest i do not have any respect for Luke(kryptix) or his server.  RSC-Live has been up for a month and has peaked 76, with many new players joining every day. Thanks everybody for spamming RSCE, As it has brought me many new players who now feel the same way about which server is better.</p>
<p>I’ve had my topic locked for nothing, And I’ve been attacked directly by Luke and others. I joined this forum because it seemed like a popular place. Turns out it is very unprofessional. I’ll continue getting my players by spamming RSCE. Thanks.</p>
