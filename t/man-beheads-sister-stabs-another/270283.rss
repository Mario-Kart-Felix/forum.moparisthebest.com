    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Kerby Revelus, a 23-year-old Milton, MA man has stabbed his 17-year-old sister, Samantha, and decapitated his 5-year-old sister, Bianca. Sky News reports that the incident took place the day after Bianca&#39;s birthday. Nine-year-old sister Serafina has been hospitalized for defensive stab wounds.

[b]Man Beheads Sister: Circumstances Leading Up to the Incident[/b]

The incident had taken place the day after 5-year-old Bianca&#39;s birthday. Nine-year-old Serafina called 911 as Kerby stabbed 17-year-old Samantha with a household knife. Police arrived in less than a minute and witnessed Kerby decapitating his sister Bianca. Police shot Kerby to death to prevent him from going after Serafina.

There is no direct motive for why he assaulted and stabbed is sisters. Neighbors report that they are a solid family with good kids and hard-working parents. According to the Boston Globe, Samantha was a high-school student who was well-respected by her teachers and peers. She was an honor roll student and a member of the Poetry Club and the Caribbean Cape Verdean Club. Five-year-old Bianca had looked forward to starting kindergarten.

The only possible precursors to the incident were that Kerby had gotten into a fist fight with a neighbor the day before. Also, neighbors report that he had recently been depressed and discouraged since leaving prison. Although he had been looking for a job, his previous criminal record had prevented him from finding work. He had been arrested in 2005 and 2007 for gun charges, but was trying to change his life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I know, if you can avoid killing a criminal, avoid it.<br>
If they had to shot they could shoot a non-lethal shoot.<br>

              <blockquote>Kerby Revelus, a 23-year-old Milton, MA man has stabbed his 17-year-old sister, Samantha, and decapitated his 5-year-old sister, Bianca. Sky News reports that the incident took place the day after Bianca's birthday. Nine-year-old sister Serafina has been hospitalized for defensive stab wounds.
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Man Beheads Sister: Circumstances Leading Up to the Incident</span></p>
<p>The incident had taken place the day after 5-year-old Bianca’s birthday. Nine-year-old Serafina called 911 as Kerby stabbed 17-year-old Samantha with a household knife. Police arrived in less than a minute and witnessed Kerby decapitating his sister Bianca. Police shot Kerby to death to prevent him from going after Serafina.</p>
<p>There is no direct motive for why he assaulted and stabbed is sisters. Neighbors report that they are a solid family with good kids and hard-working parents. According to the Boston Globe, Samantha was a high-school student who was well-respected by her teachers and peers. She was an honor roll student and a member of the Poetry Club and the Caribbean Cape Verdean Club. Five-year-old Bianca had looked forward to starting kindergarten.</p>
<p>The only possible precursors to the incident were that Kerby had gotten into a fist fight with a neighbor the day before. Also, neighbors report that he had recently been depressed and discouraged since leaving prison. Although he had been looking for a job, his previous criminal record had prevented him from finding work. He had been arrested in 2005 and 2007 for gun charges, but was trying to change his life.</p>
