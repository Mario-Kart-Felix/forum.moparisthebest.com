    <title>Nemesis V2.0!</title>

    <description>Well, I got bored on Nemesis::::Re-Written, and I&#39;m to lazy to fix some teleporting bugs in it so far, so I decided to start on a whole new server based on WhiteScape!

Updates:
1. Added in best welcome screen
2. 98% Fletching-Need the frame 246 part and the option X stuff, I&#39;ll work on it later
3. Decent Herblore added-BETTER than the current
4. 100% FULL Ardougne Stall Thieving
5. 100% Mining
6. 100% Woodcutting
7. Fixed some null stuff
8. Added in some of Wolf&#39;s tutorials for anti-crash, thanks a lot man!
9. Added in about 30% cooking, just like 4 things on ranges and fires
10. Fixed weapon animations for unarmed I.E.Kicking and punching
11. Fixed dying, blocking, and attacking animations for Jad, Fire Giants, Dwarves, Lesser and Greater demons, Kalphite Queen, all Dragons, including the King Black Dragon

Things to come:
100% Fletching
Full Herblore-not Jungle Quest herbs
Full Fishing-Should be easy enough, I have the base
Boomer&#39;s ThievingHandler-Based on level, will add it later when I work out more bugs in WhiteScape source.
Full Firemaking-I got a decent base for it
Farming-I got a decent base in mind
Crafting-Going to make it about 80%
Runecrafting-90% of it, working on it with Casella (Spleen15)
A base for all skills
NOTE:Before I even think of re-doing combat AT ALL, I will have every non combat skill working
Better weapon animations</description>
