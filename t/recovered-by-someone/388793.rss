    <title>Recovered by someone?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/recovered-by-someone/388793</link>
    <description>So my main got recovered by someone and they somehow glitched my account by changing my email and recovery questions within HOURS! So now I&#39;ve sent an email to Jagex&#39;s parent inbox and have tried many attempted recoverys with no avail. If someone HAS a contact within Jagex or knows a way I can get my account back it will BE GREATLY appreciated and I will GIVE you a reward of some sort. (Paypal, RSGP, whatever you need).

P.S: I think they may of had the account wiped via a post on the forums.

Thanks guys.</description>

I received a message on the recovery page like “only recover accounts that are owned by yourself”.<br>

Sell all your gold for 1$/M so 1x300=300 and I’d say about… 40$ for a 99 so… 40x5=200. My quests and other un-tradeables i’d add about around 200$, so about 700$. I would say.</p>
