Rune-Blaze has been recently released. We focus mainly on the development of the community and economy and make sure our players are getting the best performance in which they can possibly obtain. We provide a friendly, and diverse community. We do not affiliate ourselves with other private servers, and do not compete with others.


[B][U]Why would you want to join?[/U][/B]

We listen to the community. The community is the most important part of any game or server and on Rune-Blaze you will find yourself in one of the best RSPS communities. We also need excellent staff, and we work every day to improve Rune-Blaze. Rune-Blaze is an economy server.

There are many features in-game, and you can see a list below and link with all the links needed to play.

[B][U]Join the Server Today! We&#39;re always looking for Staff! The server recieves daily updates, we&#39;re also open to any future suggestions.[/U][/B]
