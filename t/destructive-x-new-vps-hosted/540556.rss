    <description>[center][b]I see plenty of servers these days and they&#39;re always the same... 
So recently i thought, why not come up with my own server and make it unique... Different from other servers.
and that is exactly what i did. on March 25th 2013... My birthday, I decided to pursue my goal.
We&#39;ve went from 1 player on avg to 80 and back to 1. We&#39;ve hit a lot of rough patches and to be honest my only goal... Is to have a highschool job that i enjoy... But recently i haven&#39;t been reaching alot of players... only from 1-10 players on avg... And this is because advertising is very hard nowadays... Without money, it&#39;s almost impossible to advertise your server.[COLOR=&quot;#FF0000&quot;]But its not like that if you can recieve help from players and your fellow community.[/b][/center]
[b]
What I&#39;m trying to say is that... If you join my server you will be proud. you will be astonished of the fact how friendly my community is and how much we actually care about the community. [/b]
