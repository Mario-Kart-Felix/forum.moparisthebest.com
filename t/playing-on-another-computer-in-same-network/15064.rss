    <title>Playing on another computer in same network?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/playing-on-another-computer-in-same-network/15064</link>
    <description>I have two computer in my home network (hooked up to the same router) and I have MoparScape on both of them. I was wondering if 
(1) You have to have the 43594 port forwarded to play on the non-hosting computer and 
(2) What Server IP does the non-hosting computer use? 0.0.0.0:43594? Localhost? SERVERNAME.no-ip.org?

TestScape
Thanks,
