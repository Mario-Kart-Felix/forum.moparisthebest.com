    <description>[center][size=14pt][b]Project Fallout[/b][/size]
By Cres[/center]

[b][size=10pt][u]General Information[/u][/size][/b]
You find yourself in a corrupt world , loose from any rules , where humanity has strained far from reason.
You don&#39;t know why you&#39;re here , but you know that surviving these lands won&#39;t be easy.

Project Fallout is based upon the Apocalypse-based game [b]Fallout 3[/b] by [b]Bethesda Softworks[/b].
The story goes as follows : ( skip to the GamePlay section if you don&#39;t like poorly written storylines :p )

The several Nations in the world of Gielinor have sought battle with eachother , for economic and political reasons.
At first , the barbarians tried to invade Varock because they didn&#39;t have any food left , they were stopped brutally by the King.
The Fremennik , related to the barbarians , sought revenge and engaged further battle with Varock.
When Varock was finaly invaded by the Fremenik , Falador tried to end their act of revenge.
Whilst Falador was attacking the Fremeniks in Varock , their city got attacked by the army of Bandos ( consisting from ogres , goblins , and such ).
They had answered the call of the Fremeniks who knew they couldn&#39;t fight off Falador.
When the knights of Falador finally made the Fremeniks surrender , they found that their homecity was invaded by the Bandos army.
The knights of Falador sought further help from the king of Ardougne and more of the western laid kingdoms ( Elves ).
Many other armies picked a side in this final battle , which eventually had reduced the world&#39;s population to half.
At last , the King of Ardougne won the war , at the cost of more then 5 entire civilations.
When they returned to their hometown , the inevidable happened.
A group of elitist anarchists saw the sudden apocalyptic war between the nations as their chance to strike down the authorities whilst they were weakened.
The King of Ardougne and his army were stopped there.

At current time , there is no such thing as &#39;Personal Possesion&#39; , it&#39;s yours if you can defend it.

[size=10pt][u][b]GamePlay[/b][/u][/size]
The main event is combat between players , there aren&#39;t any monsters to train on , there are however certain training oppurtunities in certain cities.

Most skills won&#39;t be trainable , whereas other skills shall be crucial to your survival.

To maintain some sort of order , you cannot attack other players inside banks , on any other area players will be able to attack you , and vice-versa offcourse.

Items for warfare can be bought from travelling merchants , or you can attempt to get the primary resources yourself ( this will include the risk of getting attacked by players ).

[size=10pt][u][b]Bosses and PvM support[/b][/u][/size]
The generals of the armies of the gods have been hidden , due to respect of their almost extinct races.
If you find yourself lucky , you may find the entrance to their hideouts.
A special note about these bosses is that they must be killed personally , you cannot rely on the help of your friends ( if you even manage to make those in this world ).

These bosses shall drop items devoted to their gods. ( Godswords , god armour , etc... ).

Sounds pretty badass. You should make the “traveling merchants” have a walking range of like 200+ lol, so players have to find them.  ;D (clip them of course, unless you want them walking on water.  :eek:)<br>

Haven’t done anything today , it was WAY too hot to barely move an inch without sweating , imagine trying to code…<br>
I’m also dry on ideas , so the next thing that shall receive my full attention shall be the bosses and that portal moving around <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>[center][size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Project Fallout</span>[/size]<br>
By Cres[/center]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=10pt]<span class="bbcode-u">General Information</span>[/size]</span><br>
You find yourself in a corrupt world , loose from any rules , where humanity has strained far from reason.<br>
You don’t know why you’re here , but you know that surviving these lands won’t be easy.</p>
<p>Project Fallout is based upon the Apocalypse-based game <span class="bbcode-b">Fallout 3</span> by <span class="bbcode-b">Bethesda Softworks</span>.<br>
The story goes as follows : ( skip to the GamePlay section if you don’t like poorly written storylines <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>
<p>The several Nations in the world of Gielinor have sought battle with eachother , for economic and political reasons.<br>
At first , the barbarians tried to invade Varock because they didn’t have any food left , they were stopped brutally by the King.<br>
The Fremennik , related to the barbarians , sought revenge and engaged further battle with Varock.<br>
When Varock was finaly invaded by the Fremenik , Falador tried to end their act of revenge.<br>
Whilst Falador was attacking the Fremeniks in Varock , their city got attacked by the army of Bandos ( consisting from ogres , goblins , and such ).<br>
They had answered the call of the Fremeniks who knew they couldn’t fight off Falador.<br>
When the knights of Falador finally made the Fremeniks surrender , they found that their homecity was invaded by the Bandos army.<br>
The knights of Falador sought further help from the king of Ardougne and more of the western laid kingdoms ( Elves ).<br>
Many other armies picked a side in this final battle , which eventually had reduced the world’s population to half.<br>
At last , the King of Ardougne won the war , at the cost of more then 5 entire civilations.<br>
When they returned to their hometown , the inevidable happened.<br>
A group of elitist anarchists saw the sudden apocalyptic war between the nations as their chance to strike down the authorities whilst they were weakened.<br>
The King of Ardougne and his army were stopped there.</p>
<p>At current time , there is no such thing as ‘Personal Possesion’ , it’s yours if you can defend it.</p>
<p>[size=10pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">GamePlay</span></span>[/size]<br>
The main event is combat between players , there aren’t any monsters to train on , there are however certain training oppurtunities in certain cities.</p>
<p>Most skills won’t be trainable , whereas other skills shall be crucial to your survival.</p>
<p>To maintain some sort of order , you cannot attack other players inside banks , on any other area players will be able to attack you , and vice-versa offcourse.</p>
<p>Items for warfare can be bought from travelling merchants , or you can attempt to get the primary resources yourself ( this will include the risk of getting attacked by players ).</p>
<p>[size=10pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Bosses and PvM support</span></span>[/size]<br>
The generals of the armies of the gods have been hidden , due to respect of their almost extinct races.<br>
If you find yourself lucky , you may find the entrance to their hideouts.<br>
A special note about these bosses is that they must be killed personally , you cannot rely on the help of your friends ( if you even manage to make those in this world ).</p>
<p>These bosses shall drop items devoted to their gods. ( Godswords , god armour , etc… ).</p>
<p>[size=10pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Development</span></span>[/size]</p>
