<p>Also, the packets will have to be descrambled unless you modify the clients to use the same sesssion keys - in which case, if I interpreted that diagram correctly, the packets would be encrypted on their way out of the helper client and would need to bypass the ISAAC scrambler in the game client. You would need to create a separate “channel” (bad word choice in Java, but I can’t think of how else to describe it) for merging helper-packets with the main game stream (which might produce its own set of problems).</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree. But I don’t see any relavance in that statement.</p>
<p>I personally don’t know anyone that has to make new scripts for every update. The strategy I think you should work towards is developing a wrapper API around all of the internals of the game and exposing that API for developers to leverage. This way, the bot developers work with what they can consider a ‘black box’. They don’t have to know <span class="bbcode-b">how</span> it works, only <span class="bbcode-b">that</span> it works.</p>
<p>And regarding the packets not having to be decrypted… I think you might find out what I’m talking about as you delve deeper into your system.</p>
<p>Good luck and if you come across any questions please post them. I’m interested to hear about progress on your system.</p>

When I replied to your post it wasn't that I was telling you you were wrong - I was just telling you some solutions that could be implemented. Your making everything about it seem so difficult when it is infact easy :P The hardest part would be identifying the randoms and decrypting the packets.

</aside>
<p>It would only work if you have someone on the other side willing to solve the random. You are relying on other people to hopefully solve the random. I think it would be unwise to put in place so much architecture for nothing more than the hope that someone is 1. there to solve the random and 2. willing to solve it properly. There’s too many variables there. I’d rather write the code correctly once, and have it solve the random forever after.</p>
<p>I’m not blowing smoke. And I am definitely not trying to detract you. Look at the design yourself and be honest. The gain is overwhelmingly smaller than the effort needed and even the expense needed to implement this type of design. I’ll explain further below.</p>

<p>Is that all? Silly me! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> What you may not have realized is that the game utilizes a rotating hash on the packet id. It is quite possible that even if you do manage to get a handle to the byte array that represents the in/out buffer for the I/O of the game, you will never get anything useful from it. There is no specific ‘server message that is received when the random starts’. Each random is different. Some of them are triggered by the appearence of a certain NPC with your id in their ‘currentInteractor’ id field. Some randoms (Evil chicken) don’t have your id in their ‘currentInteractor’ field until after you engage them in combat, but they say your name in their overhead-text. Do you have any idea how different these packets can be? Add to that the fact that all you will be seeing is a stream of numbers unless you have a packet decoder (which is possible). In order to get reflection access to that byte array means you have to first find the name of the static packet sender class, then you have to find which byte array is the proper one. Talk about round-about ways of getting a job done. That isn’t even mentioning the fact that all of the packet ids change from release to release. Incidentally, you will never decipher the packet ids without doing bytecode searching. Reflection cannot help you there.</p>

</aside>
<p>Since the only ‘uncrackable’ systems are service-based. It wouldn’t be difficult to implement. The problem is that with service-based systems you will run into resource issues. You’ll possibly have too many clients, or too many open db connections, etc. I’m sure you have a fantastic dedicated server just chompin at the bit waitin to be at your service.

          <blockquote>
              <p>This is a fantastic example of someone thinking out-of-the-box. The concepts and theoretical ideas have some merit. After reading what you are trying to do, it sounds very similar to something that psb and I had thought about trying to implement around November of last year. The concept was that a graphical client would act as a ‘proxy’ between our bot server and the game server. The client would initiate all connections to keep our bot servers from getting banned; our servers were never to connect to the game server. What this would essentially gain us was the ability to allow remote botting. We wanted to keep the bots closed source. Making the system completely service-driven allowed us this privilege. We never moved on the idea because it required a tremendous amount of work. There were also bandwidth issues and limitations once you get outside the ‘trivial’ number of users that one would likely start with. You will run into the same issue… if you were able to get the project off the ground.</p>
<p>The first hurdle you will face is the concept of ‘packet forwarding’. I’m not sure if you meant it to sound as trivial as you did. It will not be possible to forward the client data to the remote system without a modified client. And, if you have a modified client, why in the world would bother with pixel recognition or OCR? If you are inside the game code, why not hook what you are interested in while you are there?</p>
<p>Let’s say you figure out how to forward packets without BCEL or any bytecode modification. Now you have the issue of reliability. Now that we mentioned reliability, it’s worth mentioning that testing will be a complete nightmare because you are dealing with potentially distributed systems.</p>
<p>It also seemed that you had some form of an ‘Auth’ model which led me to believe that you are planning on selling the service. The hassels of writing good authentication are also nontrivial. Ask RichyT how he liked working authentication. He and I had conversations about that topic.</p>
<p>All that said, I think in concept, it’s not too bad an idea. I would say that the best approach would be to implement random event handlers into your bot system. Design your system to be interrupt driven so that your bots are recoverable in case of random events. I’m not talking about having them start over when the random happens… literally stop what they are doing, handle the random, and the pick up precisely where they left off. Of course I have a slanted opinion of that approach… It’s what I do.</p>
<p>All of my random event handlers are built into the system. I have seen Aryan or Richy’s system. They use them as ‘Addons’. This is kinda counterintuitive because a random handler is really an addon that you really would never want NOT added. I put them into the core of my system.</p>
<p>Nutshell: 5 stars for thinking out of the box. 2 stars for ease of implementation. 1 star for viability.</p>
<p>Again, I’m not saying this <span class="bbcode-i">can’t</span> be done. I’m just saying that it not necessarilly <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> be done. It’s just not very effective.</p>
