    <description>In all of the rs2 servers I have seen (players, mobs, items, objects, animations) have all had their own classes and methods for interacting with each other (with the exception of hyperion that followed rscd approach and tied players and mobs as entities) this was a good start but why the hell didn&#39;t anyone include items and objects into the mix as all the world objects share some properties 

WorldEntity -&gt; The super class of all the entities 
Confirmed variables: x,y,z,id
..InteractiveEntity (includes players,Objects with options, Items, mobs) 
..StaticEntity (includes animations, Objects with no options)
....MobileEntity (includes animations, Players, Mobs)
......Player
......Mob
......Mobile Animation
....StationaryEntity(includes animations, Objects, Items)
......Stationary Animation 
......WorldObject
......GroundItem

if we do this right we shouldn&#39;t have to rewrite the same method 5 times to deal with the different world entities of the game (like in every other server)</description>

<p>well except to add a few core calls between versions I think if setup correctly the packet.xml would be able to handle everything. What you would need is to add or remove interface methods if the version does or does not require it.</p>
<p>my biggest concern is scripting I would like to write the scripts to be interchangeable regardless of rs version this should be achievable with the exception of adding or removing new or unused packets.</p>
<p>I am sure runescape has achieved some sort of system like this. Yes I know they build UP rather than around versions but if the core is done correctly is should remove the bulk work from changing client versions.</p>

<p>as for the point class thats fine except I was looking to set it up more this way for the packet handling aspect.  instead of having methods like playerInteractWith(Object) playerInteractWith(Mob) player InteractWith(Item) you could have interactWith(entity) and be done with it.</p>

<p>Anyway, no reason you can’t wrap x/y/height into a Point class. With that done you’re only rewriting minimal code (literally only an accessor/mutator method pair).</p>
<p>Value does lie in having a superclass Mob with two child classes, Npc and Player. But your hierarchy just strikes me as unnecessarily deep.</p>

<p>Players only have an index, no idea.</p>
<p>Npcs have both an index and id.</p>
<p>Items/Objects only have an id, right?[/quote]<br>
actually everything listed has a UID and a ID most of the time people ignore the UIDS</p>
<p>However I how would I go about making it less complex The reasoning i did it like this was that all entities share the x,y,z,id,uid so that should be the super</p>
<p>Mobile properties share the walking queue and many other functions with the exception of mobile animations (maybe that needs to go somewhere else but I am unsure as to where at the moment) as the animation shares the x,y,z and id they can also travel from entity to entity.</p>
<p>Stationary entity share the fact that they can be owned by a player entity (to be seen only by a player) they also interact directly with player entity and some Mob entity so would share all the interactive methods.</p>
<p>Again stationary graphics although sharing the x,y,z and id may not need to be an entity at all. however I though it would be easier for sending the packets of if the other players can see the animations as well if they were part of the entity hierarchy.</p>

<p>Players only have an index, no idea.</p>
<p>Npcs have both an index and id.</p>
<p>Items/Objects only have an id, right?</p>

              <p>In all of the rs2 servers I have seen (players, mobs, items, objects, animations) have all had their own classes and methods for interacting with each other (with the exception of hyperion that followed rscd approach and tied players and mobs as entities) this was a good start but why the hell didn’t anyone include items and objects into the mix as all the world objects share some properties</p>
<p>WorldEntity -&gt; The super class of all the entities<br>
Confirmed variables: x,y,z,id<br>
…InteractiveEntity (includes players,Objects with options, Items, mobs)<br>
…StaticEntity (includes animations, Objects with no options)<br>
…MobileEntity (includes animations, Players, Mobs)<br>
…Player<br>
…Mob<br>
…Mobile Animation<br>
…StationaryEntity(includes animations, Objects, Items)<br>
…Stationary Animation<br>
…WorldObject<br>
…GroundItem</p>
<p>if we do this right we shouldn’t have to rewrite the same method 5 times to deal with the different world entities of the game (like in every other server)</p>
