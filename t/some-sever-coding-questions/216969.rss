    <title>Some Sever Coding Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-sever-coding-questions/216969</link>
    <description>ok i have a question on adding shops. i use the shopmaker program right? well i fill everything out generate it and place it in my server--and i compile and i get the &quot;100 errors&quot; error. and then my server wont even load. (and im using an npc that has already been put in the server--i just change things around for it to work for me) oh and a link to a tutorial on how to add areas--noob freindly--would be nice. 

(if anyone asks i can code somewhat--i can change the name of the server the starting location starting outfit, i can make it so you start out as a mod or admin for gods sake.)

my server base is runejava base source v3.0a, if you need to know.

please don&#39;t spam on this topic saying something like, &quot;HAHA you noob! you can&#39;t code a simpile shop!&quot;
or anything like that please. if you do i won&#39;t hesitate to report you.</description>

<p>I agree, and if you just want to move shops around just go to autospawn.cfg search for the npc id and then change the x and y (x first y second) to the new ones. For example…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 944	3086	3516	0	0	0	0	0	1	Pking Gear</code></pre>
<p>This npc is located at edge, but say I wanted him to be at castlewars instead. I would change the 2nd and third numbers to my new cords. (these are just made up, don’t use)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 944	6484	8489	0	0	0	0	0	1	Pking Gear</code></pre>
