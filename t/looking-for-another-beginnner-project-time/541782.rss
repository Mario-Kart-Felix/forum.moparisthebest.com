    <description>[center]I am currently looking for another beginner to work on a project with.

When I say beginner, I am talking 3-6 months experience, anything less is unwanted, anything more is likely out of my league(Although; if you are trying to be a teacher, be my guest lol!  ;) )

Okay so, let me give you a few details on how this would work.

We will use dropbox to have our source\client shared at all times, the hosting will be done from my PC.
When a majority of development is done, I have a VPS already in-line to use.

What our first steps would be...

Finding and patching bugs\dupes in a clean(ish?) open source\client.
Learning together (via skype), while adding new content.
Gathering a (small) team of people who can play the server and help us find bugs/give us suggestions.


On the side... here are a few things I would like to work on.

Custom items with DatMaker and MetaSeq.
(this includes but is not limited to itemdef(class8) or entitydef)
--Models, ints, animations--
(I would like to get more practice in on this, I want to take in as much as i can from this experience)


A little more info about the server&#39;s plans for the futures.

PvM Based
Questline\storyline from the start of the game.
Realtime gameplay
--what I mean by this is: rather than signing in for your first time, and getting 99&#39;s in a day, it will take real time, and each skill will have it&#39;s own unique benefits--

for example:

[b]Hitpoints:[/b] level directly influences your health points.

[b]Attack:[/b] slight moderation on attack speed, ability to wield new weapons, how often you hit your max hit

[b]Strength:[/b] access to new training gyms (a new one, every ten levels), max hit increase.

[b]Defence:[/b] slight moderation on how much hp you have, ability to wear new armors. 
Higher defence = less damage taken.

[b]Prayer(re-named; Divination) :[/b] Alignments to gods, elements, etc. (Alongside different prayer effects, this skill will be used to align yourself with gods and the elements to benefit different things)

[b]Magic(re-named; Spellcasting) :[/b] Alchemy, Combat, Produce; these will be broken up into several different spells.

[b]Ranged(re-named; Archery) :[/b] Used for several quest lines, some agility short cuts, and even a few bosses.

[b]Firemaking:[/b] Logs will burn like incense, each log having their own benefit.

[b]Crafting(re-named; Tailoring) :[/b] Will be used to create range\magic gear. Also, various other useful items

[b]Smithing:[/b] Will be used to re-work metal into armors and weapons.

[b]Farming:[/b] Well,err... it&#39;s farming, different seeds yield different productions.

[b]Herblore:[/b] Used to make various potions and spices which can be used on food to make it more potent.

[b]Mining:[/b] Used to harvest ores and gems for smithing and tailoring.

[b]Woodcutting(re-named; Lumberjacking) :[/b] Used to harvest wood and various items received while cutting trees down.

[b]Thieving:[/b] Used to steal items, level directly affects agileness.

[b]Fletching:[/b] Used to create ranged weapons\magic weapons (staffs, wands, orbs, etc)

[b]Agility:[/b] Level directly affects weapon attack speed, how long you can run for(run energy)

[b]Cooking:[/b] Used to cook food that can be fished\created.

[b]Fishing:[/b] Used to harvest raw fish and along certain quest-lines.

[b]Runecrafting:[/b] A very complicated skill that requires both agileness and melee experience. 
-Yields great rewards-


[b]Slayer:[/b] Slayer will be the most fun in my opinion, Your slayer level directly affects the type of monsters you can fight, for example, 1&lt;=25 will be easy, Men, Women, Guards, Barbarians, etc. 25&lt;=55 will be intermediate, things like Elemental spirits, minions, baby dragons, etc. 55&lt;=80 will be hard, things like demons, dragons, undead, etc. 80&lt;=99 will be extreme, things like gods, bosses, hoards of monsters.
As your slayer level increases, you&#39;ll gradually notice your loot increasing as well. That&#39;s because the higher your slayer level is, the greater chance you will get loot. Now this does not mean one single person with 99 will get loot so much, as from 80&lt;=99, you will be slaying with groups, and the total level of all slayer levels in group combined will make the big difference. How the loot is split i have yet to decide, but that can be determined in the future.

For more information, if you&#39;re interested, leave your skype below and I will add it.
My skype is: Justehn

I have put alot of thought into this and I am willing to dedicate a majority of my time to developing.
With that being said, I am looking for serious people only, I don&#39;t want to sound mean or anything but I am serious and willing.

Cheers!  :cool:
