    <title>Rank privileges/ donator</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rank-privileges-donator/259406</link>
    <description>Ok, I want to create my own rank.

for example;

mod = 1
admin = 2
owner = 3
hidden = 4
root admin = 20

I want to create my own rank - for example - 6

So if i did rights = 6 it would give them their own rank.

This works - however since its higher than 3, it has admin privileges.

How do i make it so a rank doesn&#39;t have those privileges.

I also tried making a rank -1.

it worked - other than the fact that this time even regular players could do the command for that rank.</description>
