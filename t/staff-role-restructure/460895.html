        <p>Tom and I were discussing a staff restructure recently and we came to the conclusion that we needed to add roles into the mix.

<p>Anyway, i‚Äôll post below what I have come up with so far. These tasks are susceptible to change so make sure you keep up with your specific roles. Also just because you‚Äôve been given a specific role doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt perform another, you just aren‚Äôt obliged to. (but it is nice to help others!)</p>
<p>Moparisthebest - Overall administration (Mopar site founder)<br>
Tom - Overall administration of server &amp; forums + technical management<br>
Zuppers - Server/Community management + technical management<br>
Si Force - Community relations<br>
Fuscate - Spawn watch, land disputes, new member set-up, event ideas, member abuse watch<br>
Kickingjamie - Member abuse watch, New member set-up, event ideas, bug abuse watch, spawn watch, nether hub maintenance<br>
Manbearpig - Member abuse watch, new member set-up, event ideas, nether hub maintenance</p>
<p>You may have noticed that some moderators have received more responsibility than others, and that is down to activity mainly. We have given moderators who are more active around the community more tasks as we know these will be carried out more frequently and with reliability. If you‚Äôre up to taking on more tasks, feel free to volunteer. I‚Äôll briefly go through what each task involves below:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">New member set-up</span>: While some new members may like to be left alone, there are others who are more reliable on others. It is now your job to help these members by suggesting places in which they can locate and perhaps even team up with other members of the community. We don‚Äôt expect you to give them free stuff, although feel free to do so, but we expect you to be mature and helpful to these members.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Event ideas</span>: All moderators have this role. We want all of you to think collectively and suggest ideas for future server events. Things such as spleef championships and other such games are a great way to bring the community together. Please feel free to suggest events, competitions and other such trivial festivities. We want to encourage it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Spawn watch</span>: Those with this task are expected to keep an eye on the spawn and make sure it is kept in good order. By this I mean filling massive, pointless holes if you get the time and perhaps removing abandoned shacks and the likes. If you feel there‚Äôs a questionable building that may or may not pass for being removed, contact me and I‚Äôll give my opinion on it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Land disputes</span>: I don‚Äôt expect too many of these for now, but when we start advertising people will be driven closer and closer together. This will inevitably cause land disputes and similar problems, so here a moderator must visit the scene and then decide the outcome. Please take into consideration who was there first, but also take into account that the original settler may have an unreasonable amount of land, which is not in the servers best interests.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Nether hub maintenance</span>:</p>
<p>Maintenance of the nether hub, you make sure everything is nice and pretty. If something needs fixing, please fix it. If you need materials to fix it, I‚Äôll provide them, so just ask me. If a member needs help connecting his portal to the hub, you are obliged to give them some sort of assistance, whether it be giving them direction or helping to dig their tunnels, that‚Äôs up to you.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Member &amp; bug abuse watch</span>: Member abuse occurs frequently online, in fact I see it everyday on Moparscape. On a minecraft server though it can be more than just verbal abuse, as the offender can assault, annoy and otherwise disturb what another minecraft player may be trying to do. We want to discourage this as we want a friendly enviroment on the server, not an elitist one. Therefore who ever is in with this task must discourage member abuse and help foster a kinder relationship. Bug abuse is basically the same, please report to us any bugs/glitches on the server that the members may take advantage of.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs basically it for now, if you could please post below confirming you understand your assigned duties. All moderators are expected to handle reports. And if you‚Äôre all wondering, I get all of the above roles‚Ä¶ lucky me :rolleyes:. These changes are gearing the staff team towards becoming a functional, efficient unit for when advertising commences, (which I believe will be very soon) so be on your toes!</p>
<p>On another note, there‚Äôs a new award called ‚ÄòSpleef Champion‚Äô being added shortly (whenever Moparisthebest gets around to it), so we‚Äôll be looking to give that out as well as a way to hand out the redstone award.</p>

<p>Sure, i‚Äôll add you into it. Also I intend on building a spleef arena soon enough, but hasn‚Äôt Teresa built one?  Also can you go more in depth about a ‚Äòcommunity giver‚Äô award? It sounds interesting but i‚Äôm not sure what it entails.</p>

        <p>The spleef award has been added, as for the arena Teresa is building, it‚Äôs a nice arena and I certainly think it could be using if she agrees in the future. As those who attended the Skype meeting will know I wanted to push forward the idea of a spawn community, and with that some form of complex arena.</p>
<p>I certainly think the spawn arena in the future should be the main venue for the handing out of such awards.</p>
