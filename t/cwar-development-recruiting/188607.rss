    <title>Cwar Development {Recruiting}</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cwar-development-recruiting/188607</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m Coder X.  Bascially me and my friend Si Force, a couple days ago wanted to make a server.  But we realized that they all were bascially the same!  So I came up with the idea to base a sever in Castle Wars.  

The whole server is Castle Wars base.  When you login, your randomly chosen either in Zamorak, or Saradomin.  In each respawn room there are all of the same shops, except Sara shop as sara stuff, Zam has Zam stuff.  The point to the game is capturing the flag and bringing it back, although that will be quite difficult, most people can barrage and everything.  It&#39;s not just about capturing the flag either, you can pk out in the battlefield.  

[u]Some problems we might face[/u]

- Random Team Picker?
- People making new accounts to be on a certain team
(Probably lots more to be added)

[u]Benefits[/u]

- We plan on taking out the whole rs(less laggggg) besides Castle Wars
- With me hosting, i&#39;m guessing i can hold 50 since i got more ram
- Fairly new idea
- If you be part of the team you&#39;ll get mod in server once released


To be on the team you must have someone expierience in coding (some of you say it&#39;s not called coding w/e).  
- You must have msn
- You can&#39;t be working on any other servers

[u][i][b]TEAM[/b][/i][/u]

Coder X - HOSTING
Si Force - CODING


[u]We are currently looking for:[/u]

2 more coders
1 forum maker
2 global admins on forums(not including forum maker)
3 Mods in Server

This can be intertwined with MySQL, enabling registration to login and play. This would stop multi accounts.<br>
