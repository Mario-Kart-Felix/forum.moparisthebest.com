How about we keep ‘legality’ <span class="bbcode-b">out</span> of this. Ruby doesn’t have to explain anything to anyone (accept the development team) and not to mention, work hours isn’t relevant to the OP at all.</p>
<p>Ruby, I’ve known you for quite some time. I can’t say we’ve been the best of friends, but I do know you well enough to say you aren’t capable of such idiocy. That’s just my 2cents.</p>
<p>OP: this project’s looking great. I hope you all figure out/fix all the complications you’ve encountered these past few days.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Sure thing, but since i’m willing to drop it you should <span class="bbcode-b">definitly</span> either read a dictionary or take another grammar class…Just a suggestion…[/quote]<br>
And before you start to insult people about their grammar maybe check yours before you post.</p>

Wait wat, I’ve just got in the door after working 18 hours and someones accusing me of redirecting something? Go look at the cpanel logs you fools instead of pointing fingers. Why would I hack a site that I’m working on? Don’t be so idiotic, I’m not a child, I have no reason to attack such a site. If I wanted to damage I sure as fuck wouldn’t have simply redirected it somewhere.<br>

We think it was hacked by either ruby or imthenull on mopar and was redirected to <a href="http://lemonparty.com" rel="nofollow noopener">lemonparty.com</a>. I was told this by Dondxon our main webveloper on r-s earlier today. I have been busy with finals so I never saw it but it has been reset and fixed and we will make sure it doesn’t happen again. I’m deeply sorry about that. Website has been fixed now the link is still <a href="http://2006redone.org" rel="nofollow noopener">2006redone.org</a> and I’ll add it back to the main thread soon after we make sure it’s all settled but it should be all good now.</p>
