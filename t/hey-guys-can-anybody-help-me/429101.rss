    <description>Hey guys, so whenever I zip my cache, I open the original cache and zip all of the contents inside, upload it to dropbox or fileden, and then after I change the cachedownloader and everything, and upload it to my client, it gets an error, I know why I get it, I just dunno how to fix it. Whenever it uploads it gets a random zipped file in my cache and all the files are in that file and you can only get them out manually, can anyone help me so they come out themselves?</description>

              <p>The error is that it can’t find the files it needs, it’s because its in a zipped file inside my cache and idk why it won’t unzip by itself, I didn’t copy and paste, I zipped the contents in my cache and uploaded them.</p>
