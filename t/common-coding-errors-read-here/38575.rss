    <title>Common Coding Errors [READ HERE!]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/common-coding-errors-read-here/38575</link>
    <description>This miny tutorial was compiled with common errors people are posting. It is kinda like a FAQ although there is already one. But this FAQ will cover coding issues. I no these errors are really really easy to overcome, but from what I have seen people may need to chech this out.
[hr]
[glow=red,2,300]Error One[/glow]

[ul][li]Majority of beginner coders will no doubt be perfect. When getting an error in your compiler window majority of the time you cannot distinguish the issue, it may be because the code looks similar to all the other code you have written. An easier way to pin point the issue is by searching the numeral at the beginning of the error. e.g.[/li][/ul]

[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img185.imageshack.us/img185/2135/lineerrornu6.jpg[/img][/URL]
Now open the file and hit [glow=red,2,300]CTRL + G[/glow] now type the respected line number.
[/list]
[hr]
[glow=red,2,300]Error Two[/glow]

[ul][li]This next error is seen alot with big class compiling as the slightest mistake can sometimes destroy your work. This is what is known as a brace error. And the solution above is no good. e.g.
[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img350.imageshack.us/img350/6319/anothererrordr7.jpg[/img][/URL]
The best solution is to go through and look for your most recent additions. And make sure every brace is closed. Or you can download a  decent text editor which will should distinguish the error as the text bellow the error should be a different colour then that of the code before the error.[/ul]
