                    SERVER IS: ONLINE!

- EmbodiedPKz is a 317 server with some customs and some unique features.
- The server is still being made at the moment and can be using some more coding help being that i&#39;m new to coding. 
- If you wanna see some of the features that have been added to the server go to the Homepage and Forums!
The Homepage is being changed day-by-day. 
- You can register at: [URL=http://&quot;http://embodiedrsps.webs.com&quot;]EmbodiedPKz homepage![/URL] 
- Webclient up now! - [URL=http://&quot;www.rswebclients.com/play/EmbodiedPKz&quot;]Webclient![/URL]

Since there ain&#39;t much activity on my forums i&#39;ll just post some of the stuff I updated each day. 
June 23rd:
- Fixed the bug where people that would join the server and wouldn&#39;t receive a Starter Pack.
- Fixed the teleports, There was no way to teleport at all (unless you were Donator+ and could go to Donator Zone)
[Now there&#39;s Monster teleports, Minigame/Boss teleports, and Skilling teleports]
- Changed the home to Shanty Pass, It&#39;s smaller and less spread apart and easier to get your things and go!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~ Working on adding a &quot;Bank-All&quot; option while in the bank.
~ Working on adding a Slayer point system and a Shop to go along with it. (Will make tasks more challenging)
~ Working on adding NPCs to the Monster teleports.
~ Working on fixing Skilling areas.

This is the Starter Package (Just for testing)^

These are the 3 teleport options that are currently available, I&#39;ll be adding more eventually. ^

This is the current home. I don&#39;t like it so i&#39;ll change it eventually. 

Note: A large amount of the content which is out now is for people to use during testing. and I would like it if you guys would help me by telling me about some of the bugs you guys see, and even suggestions to make the server a better place and more like-able for other players.
Once the server is finish and is to my liking I&#39;ll reset everyone&#39;s account so people that we&#39;re helping me test don&#39;t have any advantages over the other players. If you donate. you&#39;ll be a Donator through-out testing and once the server is online, i&#39;ll keep your account but reset everything to 1 and strip you of your items. 

Thanks guys!</description>
