    <description>Well, I downloaded the MoparScape 3.2/W Aryan, and I downloaded the latest Java with I downloaded jre-6u1-windows-1586-p-iftw.exe now I don&#39;t know what the problem may be but this is whats happening.

1)I run MoparScape
2) I says &quot;Downloading File&quot;
3)It gets a few % and the exits out on me.
