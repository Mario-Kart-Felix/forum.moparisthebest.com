    <title>Astral Projection</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/astral-projection/156168</link>
    <description>Has anyone else ever tried astral projection? I&#39;ve been trying to project over the last few days, and I&#39;ve almost done it. In fact, I&#39;m quite sure I&#39;ve left my body, though I won&#39;t discuss why I&#39;m sure; I don&#39;t want to get too long-winded. All I will say is that I left my body for a few seconds before being slammed down into it again. I suspect that my physical body was getting cold, and decided to not let me go far without wearing a blanket. Also, in the process of trying astral projection, I&#39;ve found an amazing method of relaxation. Anyways, discuss astral projection and your experiences with it.</description>
