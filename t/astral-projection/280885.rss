    <title>Astral Projection</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/astral-projection/280885</link>
    <description>Astral Projection is the ability to leave your physical body, and travel to the Astral Plane. Now many people get Astral and Etheric (I think it&#39;s spelled right) projection mixed up. [b]Astral Projection[/b] is leaving the physical plane entirely. [b]Etheric Projection[/b] is leaving your body; but staying in the physical plane. Now, I&#39;ll be honest; I&#39;ve only barely done it twice, and I&#39;m still a beginner at it. But, I am interested to see if anyone here believes in it, and if they could share their methods. 



My method is pretty simple; listen to some binaural beats and lie down, relax, concentrate on the back of my head, and wait for the vibrations.



So do you believe?


EDIT: Please give reasoning, or back up your belief. Thank you.</description>

<p>Yup, I thought you were one of those “dumb psychics” up until you said this xD  I mistook you for one of them cause you were going on about leaving your body and how Astral Projection is real.  I still think you’re one of those “Dumb Psychics” but not one who takes their beliefs to extremes and bases their life around them.  I guess you’d be more of just a person who has wierd beliefs than a “Dumb Psychic”<br>

<p>I don’t have any belief that doesn’t fit into science. When I say leave your body I never meant to physically leave as a soul or something. I understand that if I was to leave my body, it would only be in my mind.</p>
<p>Despite how the wikipedia article makes it seem, you don’t need to believe in any of the paranormal stories that go along with astral projection. I’m sure most practicers don’t believe in it either and are able to distinguish that it’s only in their mind. And really the whole idea of astral projection is to “look into” your self and your mind.[/quote]</p>
<p>Look if it’s not supernatural flubajube then you’re thinking of the wrong thing.  Astral Projection is different from what you’re thinking of.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not harder.  Impossible.<br>
It’s to do with the supernatural and thus comes under the classification of a belief.  There is no way to prove it so we just assume it isn’t true.</p>
<p>If you did your experiment we could establish if Astral Projection is even possible.  It still wouldn’t be real or testable but we would be able to establish whether or not it’s even possible for those people to do this Astral Projection thing.<br>
If person knows what picture is then that still doesn’t prove Astral projection is real cause you don’t know what happened in the dream, there are infinate explainations all equally true.  If person doesn’t know what picture was or can’t describe it then that person is 100% bullshitting.</p>

i thought astral projection was outside of sleep?<br>
otherwise thats just dreaming<br>
anyways, im pretty sure you arent supposed to be able to see new things, its just a dream like thing where you see yourself</p>

I barely dream now and I haven’t had a nightmare since I was about 12.  Maybe it’s to do with the fact that i’m skeptical about everything or maybe it’s just cause I used to have sleeping problems, I duno.<br>

<p>Yer I know that you dream 4 times a night.  I actually thought you dreamt the entire time you sleep but aye doesn’t matter.<br>
I meant that I don’t see dreams now like you know how you occasionally can remember a dream you had or when you feel like your in the dream and it feels 100% real but as soon as you get out of it you realise it wasn’t.  I barely get that now,  Like once or twice a year.</p>
<p>Astral projection is not real.  Your concept of Astral projection is wrong.  It’s not when you dream as if you are floating outside your body, that’s simply dreaming.  Astral projection is about physically going outside your body and into one or more Astral planes.  Now that definition is to do with supernatural.</p>
<p>To make what i’ve said above a hypothesis and not a belief you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prove you can physically leave your body</li>
<li>Prove that these Astral planes exist</li>
</ol>
<p>And you you have to have like solid evidence for this, it cannot be something that COULD prove it is possible to leave your body, it has to be something that is obvious and pretty much staring Science in the face.</p>

<p>That’s called a dream…<br>
If you’re talking about that, that has nothing to do with the supernatural, it’s like when you wake up from a nightmare your body is exhausted and you’re puffing and panting.  It’s because the nightmare seems real to you so your body reacts to it like it would in reality.</p>
<p>I barely dream now and I haven’t had a nightmare since I was about 12.  Maybe it’s to do with the fact that i’m skeptical about everything or maybe it’s just cause I used to have sleeping problems, I duno.</p>
<p>I used to have this, usually when i’m waking up in the morning but there’s nothing to it, it’s simply dreaming.  Believing that it actually happened is retarded.  It’s most likely your foot smashed against the wall in your dream because your leg pained not the other way round.  If it was the other way round then it’s because of what i’ve said above.  Pretty much there is to stories like those that can’t be solved with just thinking about them.  Whats more likely, humans can go out of there physical bodys or you simply dream it.</p>
<p>A famous Scientist once said “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence” i’ve failed to see one piece of evidence here.</p>
<p>Oh and no Sanga this post isn’t directed at you, really I think this discussion should just end, we’ve already established that this “Astral Projection” is not some supernatural thing and is just a ridiculous claim made by idiots who can’t establish the difference between dream(in this case) and reality.</p>
<p>If anyone here is to even attempt to prove that this is true then at least have a basic study of how the brain and dreams work.[/quote]<br>
our discussion did end :S anyway what i was going to say was: there is a theory(or it might be a fact i cant really remember) that you are always dreaming but when you return to consciousness your brain just lets go of the dreams and you forget them.</p>

<p>It’s not great actually, lieing in your bed for 10 minutes in the morning, only being able to move your eyes and panicking like shit because you can’t move, then screaming so loudly only to find, when you eventually gain control of your body, that you weren’t screaming at all and no one heard you. They were the worst days of my life right there, fucked me right up.</p>
