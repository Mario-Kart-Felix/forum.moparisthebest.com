<p>Yup, I thought you were one of those “dumb psychics” up until you said this xD  I mistook you for one of them cause you were going on about leaving your body and how Astral Projection is real.  I still think you’re one of those “Dumb Psychics” but not one who takes their beliefs to extremes and bases their life around them.  I guess you’d be more of just a person who has wierd beliefs than a “Dumb Psychic”</p>

<p>I don’t have any belief that doesn’t fit into science. When I say leave your body I never meant to physically leave as a soul or something. I understand that if I was to leave my body, it would only be in my mind.</p>
<p>Despite how the wikipedia article makes it seem, you don’t need to believe in any of the paranormal stories that go along with astral projection. I’m sure most practicers don’t believe in it either and are able to distinguish that it’s only in their mind. And really the whole idea of astral projection is to “look into” your self and your mind.</p>

<p>Look if it’s not supernatural flubajube then you’re thinking of the wrong thing.  Astral Projection is different from what you’re thinking of.</p>
