        <p>Imo it’s basically the same idea as lucid dreaming. Though not quite. With astral projection your using trance/dreaming to “look into” yourself. You will see and experience things that can’t be explained in text or speech.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>yakman: You can try it by your self, if the work you have real evidence that you know are true.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There are 2 ways to prove something to yourself. Scientifically, using the Scientific method and Personal Experience.  Now Personal Experience is not a valid argument, ever.  The only way to prove something is true or exists is Scientifically.  It’s like me saying that the boogeyman exists because I vaugely saw and heard him last night.  As foolish as you’d think I am for saying that I think you are for saying that trying it and thinking you’ve left your body is evidence that you can leave your body.</p>
<p>If we assume that personal experience is a valid argument then I am right when I say that last night I jumped inside my computer and was a 2D image for a few hours then I jumped out again and I was back to normal.</p>
<p>Now if we look at that using the Scientific method well we cannot look at it using the Scientific method because though I have a claim that claim is not testable.  Thus we don’t say it is right or wrong we say it is invalid.  Now we of course assume all these invalid claims to be false because only a finite amount can be right but and infinate amount can be wrong and there’s no way to distinguse any of them from right and wrong.</p>
<p>We can distinguse if my claim is even possible by testing the factors that I have mentioned.  We can test to find if it’s even possible to jump into a computer or possible to be a 2D image.  The thing is though, even if it is possible my claim is still invalid, my claim based on personal experience can never become a theory because it does not reach the standards needed to be classed as a hypothesis.  A hypothesis MUST be testable.</p>
<p>Oh and if you havn’t realised this goes for all beliefs.  All beliefs are invalid when trying to prove if they are true or not because we can only base our beliefs on personal experience.</p>

They think of it as unnatural, etc. As wayzey as stated, it cannot be tested. You can only share experiences / beliefs on it.

I just don’t get what’s not to believe. It’s similar to lucid dreaming. Except, you’re not sleeping. You’re meditating.</p>
<p>No your not physically leaving your body as some soul/spirit. No demons can’t posess you. No angels or divine spirits are involved. This is just stupid ideas that some people believe. It’s as dumb as believing the stuff you see in your dreams. But tell me this. Dreams are pretty cool right? Your mind just wandering like crazy putting all these images and events into place. Think of astral projection as another way of achieving this.</p>
<p>What’s really amazing is just how well some people can do it. They can relive past memories (or observe), or whatever they want really. Like an all-access pass to your brain.<br>
[/quote]To be honest; my family considers it “odd” to even attempt to control your dreams, which I do anyway. They think of it as unnatural, etc. As wayzey as stated, it cannot be tested. You can only share experiences / beliefs on it. There have been tests on Remote Viewing and even government projects dealing with that and Astral Projection (Look up “Project Stargate” it’s an interesting read about the United States using alleged psychics as spies, which worked remarkably well) It’s just like religion, you cannot prove / disprove it.[/quote]</p>
<p>No you completely misunderstand what I meant by that.<br>
You didn’t mean to but you did take what I said out of context xD</p>
<p>When something is invalid it doesn’t mean it’s 50/50 it means that there is no answer.  on a scale from 0 to 10 on how true it is it cannot be on that scale.</p>
<p>If something is like this then we assume it to be false because we cannot test it though we label anything that comes under this a belief and thus things like Religion and other supernatural things fall into this catagory of belief.</p>
<p>Now i’m not saying your religion is wrong or anything but everything that is classified as a belief is assumed to be false.  This is because there is no way to prove it right and in Science something is false until proven true.  This is for the same reasons that in court someone is innocent until proven guilty.  If there is no evidence to prove that ________ killed ________ then the man is assumed to be innocent.  If there is no way to prove that he is guilty then he can never be guilty so we assume he is innocent.  Now if that someone actually was guilty but there was no way at all to prove that he was then he is still assumed to be innocent.  Why is this?   Because if someone is killed by another person we are not going to assume 6 billion people are guilty, we are not going to assume that 6 billion people might have done it.  If there is no way to prove who killed the person we don’t assume anything because there is no way to distinguise out of those 6 billion people, anyone who was more likely to do it.</p>
<p>Now that’s theoretical obviously as if a crime is commited there will always be evidence.  It’s an analogy for how Science looks upon beliefs though.  According to Science religion is neither right nor wrong though in Science we assume it is wrong because if we assumed it was right any future test related in anyway to religion or lets just say god could be corrupted and thus we recieve invalid results which we percieve to be true.</p>
<p>Now beliefs are almost entirely based on appealing to emotion.  It’s fine to have beliefs, morals are beliefs, ethics are beliefs, the government system is a belief, i’m not saying it’s bad to have a belief though it’s irrational it’s human to have beliefs because it’s human to have emotions.<br>
Now something like Maths and Economics, the actual symbols themselves are beliefs but the equations are to do with logic.  Logic is to with patterns in everything, logic also cannot prove anything that isn’t to do with logic true but it can help aid us to find evidence or to give us a clearer understanding of something very complex.<br>
We call anything do with with logic and rational rational evidence whilst everything to do with proving things in the natural world true and false are to do with Emperical Evidence.</p>
<p>So pretty much you have Rational Evidence, Emperical Evidence and Beliefs.<br>
Rational evidence is stuff like language, mathematics, equations, logical patterns<br>
Emperical Evidence is stuff like testable, practical ideas withing the natural world<br>
Beliefs are everything that doesn’t fall into the 2 catagorys above</p>

its like the question, what colour are the snooker balls? We all know that there are reds,a blue, a yellow, a green etc but what colour are they actually. We all know the colour of the ball is red but when i see red i see my red and you look at it and see your red which could be the same as my yellow or my green or any other colour that i perceive, but we are both told the ball is red and therefore think of that colour as red.</p>

<p>I think you’re missing the point of my post.  I know all that, i’ve studied topics such as those before.<br>
I was hoping people on this forum would be intelligent enough to be able to make assumptions and to realise when someone is making assumptions.  Ironically enough, because you made the assumption that I was saying the only way to prove to be absolutely certainly true is Scientifically you have ignored my assumptions which are very obvious.</p>
<p>For one I never talk about absolute certainty, nothing can ever be 100% true or 100% false unless it is in theory.<br>
If you read up a bit you’ll see that I said that the only truths in Science are Equations and just using your brain here what do equations have to do with? Rational Evidence and it just so happens that there can only be absolutes in Rational Evidence.</p>
<p>Look what I meant was prove things to be likely or unlikely to be true, in science we ASSUME all beliefs to be false and I don’t want to explain it again, just read my post above.  Since when do people have to put assume in front of everything when talking about Science.  Science is all about assumptions but it’s to do with classifying things as right or wrong so we always assume something is right or wrong in Science because theoretically it’s possible for this entire universe to not exist or for my whole life to be one huge lie.  These are not true though because they are not testable and thus they are beliefs and are just as likely to happen or be as true as any other belief.</p>
<p>Oh and Sanga they’ve actually found that we all do see the same or relatively the same colours unless we are colour blind.  A bucket is not actually blue, blue is just the light that is reflected off the bucket.<br>

well done you can copy and paste light wavelengths, and again that is not proof as the brain can interpret what it says in any manner it chooses so you have no idea what i see compared to what you see. Secondly i wasn’t even referring to your post it was just in his post and i couldn’t be arsed to remove it from the quote, so don’t go on with shitty lectures that were probably composed by someone else as i really don’t give a shit. Also you don’t have to capitalize words like rational evidence, science or eqautions every fucking time, science perhaps you could get away with but not the others. Stop being a bell end.</p>

<p>Incorrect. There is no way to “prove” any claim, at all. This is because you do not have access to reality, only your own perception of it. You could be living inside a computer program (Think the matrix) that is telling you you are seeing and hearing and communicating all these fantastic things. If you choose to accept science, you must also accept that you cannot prove it has any value outside of your own perception. The real fun begins when you take said perception as the basis of reality, which has been done: <a href="http://www.megafoundation.org/CTMU.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.megafoundation.org/CTMU.html</a></p>

<p>its like the question, what colour are the snooker balls? We all know that there are reds,a blue, a yellow, a green etc but what colour are they actually. We all know the colour of the ball is red but when i see red i see my red and you look at it and see your red which could be the same as my yellow or my green or any other colour that i perceive, but we are both told the ball is red and therefore think of that colour as red.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think you’re missing the point of my post.  I know all that, i’ve studied topics such as those before.<br>
I was hoping people on this forum would be intelligent enough to be able to make assumptions and to realise when someone is making assumptions.  Ironically enough, because you made the assumption that I was saying the only way to prove to be absolutely certainly true is Scientifically you have ignored my assumptions which are very obvious.</p>
<p>For one I never talk about absolute certainty, nothing can ever be 100% true or 100% false unless it is in theory.<br>
If you read up a bit you’ll see that I said that the only truths in Science are Equations and just using your brain here what do equations have to do with? Rational Evidence and it just so happens that there can only be absolutes in Rational Evidence.</p>
<p>Look what I meant was prove things to be likely or unlikely to be true, in science we ASSUME all beliefs to be false and I don’t want to explain it again, just read my post above.  Since when do people have to put assume in front of everything when talking about Science.  Science is all about assumptions but it’s to do with classifying things as right or wrong so we always assume something is right or wrong in Science because theoretically it’s possible for this entire universe to not exist or for my whole life to be one huge lie.  These are not true though because they are not testable and thus they are beliefs and are just as likely to happen or be as true as any other belief.</p>
<p>Oh and Sanga they’ve actually found that we all do see the same or relatively the same colours unless we are colour blind.  A bucket is not actually blue, blue is just the light that is reflected off the bucket.<br>
Oh and how we see colour is to do with the lights wavelength and intensity.</p>
<p>Here’s a chart: (If it fucks up use the link below)<br>

well done you can copy and paste light wavelengths, and again that is not proof as the brain can interpret what it says in any manner it chooses so you have no idea what i see compared to what you see. Secondly i wasn’t even referring to your post it was just in his post and i couldn’t be arsed to remove it from the quote, so don’t go on with shitty lectures that were probably composed by someone else as i really don’t give a shit. Also you don’t have to capitalize words like rational evidence, science or eqautions every fucking time, science perhaps you could get away with but not the others. Stop being a bell end.[/quote]</p>
<p>For one, only a small amount of the post was directed at you.  The rest was at him.  I didn’t quote both of you because his quote was in your quote.  Sorry that’s my fault I should have made it clearer.</p>
<p>The only part I copied was the table and the point I was making was that my red cannot be your blue because things aren’t actually red or blue or peach coloured, nothing actually has a colour.  When we look at a blue bucket the reason it is blue is because of the light reflecting off it.  Get rid of the light and what do you get?  Pitch black.<br>
Now my Red cannot be your blue for example because then that would mean that my brain reads the light as having a wavelength of 700lambda whilst your brain reads it as being 420lambda.  Now this is testable as colour perception is due to the ventral stream of the brain.  Scientists have done many experiments related to this, they record the brain activity of patients when shown different colours and hey guess what, we all see the same colours(i’m of course assuming that being a few shades different doesn’t matter since there are tens of millions of shades of colour)</p>
<p>Sorry that I capitalize words that are important, I only capitalized Assume in my last post because Javaisnotrecognized really misunderstood what I was saying and assumed that I was talking about absolute certainty.</p>
<p>Are you trying to start a flame war with me or something cause so far noone has tried to understand my posts, you’ve all just tried to find small faults and criticize them.  Then when I prove you wrong you just bullshit like an stubborn arrogant lil bitch until I just drop the argument completely.</p>
<p>Oh and yes that’s directed at you this time Sanga, but it’s also directed at pretty much everyone who doesn’t care about whos right or wrong but instead only wants to prove to himself that he’s right in any means possible.</p>

<p>thats me taking things out of context, and i didn’t even want to have this conversation with you, i showed a way to prove whether its possible to actually ‘leave’ your body or whether its the mind showing a random display of images from what it can already see. And no you dont need to explain everything i already know its gonna be retarded with some bullshit back argument that is 100% opinions that you will swear blind are facts. So just end it here and shut the fuck up and go tuck yourself back into bed before it gets too late. Regardless of whether you attempt another futile rebut i am not going to reply to it.</p>

<p>Seriously do I really need to explain EVERYTHING to you, do you have absolutely NO interpreting and decision making skills?</p>
<p>I’m going to highlight a part of my post for you.  [quote]You<span class="bbcode-b"> and</span> your type[/quote]  From what i’ve seen though I wouldn’t be surprised if you just post another smartass comment where you’ve taken what i’ve said entirely out of context.</p>

<p>thats me taking things out of context, and i didn’t even want to have this conversation with you, i showed a way to prove whether its possible to actually ‘leave’ your body or whether its the mind showing a random display of images from what it can already see. And no you dont need to explain everything i already know its gonna be retarded with some bullshit back argument that is 100% opinions that you will swear blind are facts. So just end it here and shut the fuck up and go tuck yourself back into bed before it gets too late. Regardless of whether you attempt another futile rebut i am not going to reply to it.[/quote]</p>
<p>No that’s changing what I said not taking what I said out of context.  There completely different but dw i’m just going to drop it because if not then your just going to continue this now pointless argument.</p>
