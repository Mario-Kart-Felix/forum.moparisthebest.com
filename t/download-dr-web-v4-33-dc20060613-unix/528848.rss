    <description>He couldn&#39;t just sit here, could he?But on the other hand, sometimes those who were injured ought not to be moved.Maybe he should go for help.But the nearest village could be hours away — even if he knew which way to go — and that would give wild animals far too much time to find a fine, easy meal.He cut up more of the horker hide coat and chopped off some willow branches, which he then spent an hour or so fashioning into a travois.

A few moments later he was dragging Sul through the forest, worried, but feeling a sense of accomplishment.He was pretty sure he knew which direction the Ring Road was, and from there he could find almost anything.It was slow going in the woods, and he had to stop frequently to reposition the makeshift harness or to rest.He was sure there was a better way to design a travois, but he&#39;d never had occasion to build one before, and although he had seen them, he hadn&#39;t studied their structure.He dithered a bit about where he ought to go. 
If they were west, the Imperial City was close, but so was his hunting lodge in Ione.Should he go there first, get Sul tended to, acquire some guards?Or go straight for the Imperial City?Attrebus reached the road more quickly than he thought he would, an hour or so before sundown.Lake Rumare was the most beautiful thing he had seen in a long time, its familiar waters turning coral as the evening deepened.

The familiar cries of curlews and coots were music to him.And then there was the Imperial City itself, standing proud and strong on its island, the White-Gold Tower at its center like a pillar holding up the heavens — as some claimed it actually did.For Attrebus, however, it was proof that his quest had been worth it, that he wasn&#39;t too late.His father would listen to him now.With or without Sul, they would invade Umbriel somehow and return Umbra to his sword.</description>
