Actually, all but one rep message comes from Community Members.</p>
<p>And contrary to the belief that you (and probably many others) hold, people can get to the position via means other than programming.</p>
<p>Any other stupid things that you’d like to say James? I’m all eyes.</p>

That is essentially the case. However we do check the reasons (and I check the posts) - if they’re absolutely stupid then I just delete them.</p>
<p>On another note James, how long are you G:lined for on IRC? We’re all missing your presence. At least the so-called morons that have achieved Community Member status lately can behave.</p>
