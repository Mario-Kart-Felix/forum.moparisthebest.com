    <title>Help adding RUNESCAPE music to server (no tuts work*)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-adding-runescape-music-to-server-no-tuts-work/473323</link>
    <description>will none of tuts help at all.

plz help me add music to my server
i have 2 servers that are 317(recreation f2p and runescape 194)(delta) and have old runescape music.
when your client is loading it starts playing the old runescape log on and then switches when you log in and the song switches when you go at a certain x and y position. (sorta like 2006scape)

i wanted to know how to add music to my pi 317 (trisidiax v2)
i tried copying and pasting but it gives me error, i copyed the music too and music files.</description>
