    <description>Yes, Ladies and Gentleman, Yet another development team. Yes i know every other one claims they will make the best server ever built....then you never hear from them after a few weeks and you never hear any news....odd huh?

But on to the more important stuff. I am the creator of heaven and hell scape for those who dont know me or my old server then never mind that comment. I had a few ideas for a server and im running with them...even if its alone. Onyxscape (working name) will be different in that:
[1] Kinda cool starting place. (still need to find a good city for base)
[2] Silver crowns will represent Veteran/Hero/Member Players.
[3] Unique shops and such.

More to the point. The server will be an npc based server. With 1 major quests and im sure ill add more to the list. But the main quest will be the Veteran Quest. Which allows you to wear the elite items of the server. Have access to new shops and many other things. They will also have a Silver Crown (usually called the mod crown) by their name. The Staff will all be of the same level. No Mod&#39;s or Admin&#39;s or such. Just Staff.

Anyways this is just an idea in the making. I already know alot of what i want. Just not where. But Anyways if you are still reading this and actually care. Apply.

[code]
Name:
Msn:
Reason for applying:
How Can you help me?:
[/code]

Thank you for reading and i hope you join. If not hope you join the server.</description>
