    <title>Anybody help? will give DEV RANK</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anybody-help-will-give-dev-rank/550267</link>
    <description>So I have a client+ source, I have portforwarded and changed the JDK version to my current verion,
Source runs and I fixed the client to run and log in.

but my friends can&#39;t log in
And now i did something to where I can&#39;t even log in anymore :\

Could somebody get on TV or skype with me and show me or something?
I&#39;ll be willing to give you credit for my promo video, and give you Developer rank, or Admin.

If anybody could please help i&#39;d be so appreciative 
Thank you, and god bless.</description>
