    <title>Stupid Mistake - Messed up my HDD</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stupid-mistake-messed-up-my-hdd/278358</link>
    <description>On my 250gb HDD I had about 10GB of unallocated space from ages ago. This space had nothing on, it had been secure erased. I recently torrented Partition Magic, and so tried to go about turning the unallocated partition in to an NTFS format and then merging it with my Windows partition. Anyway, when I pressed apply to re-format the partition I got a BSoD with contained the following technical errors:

STOP: 0x000000CA (0x00000001, 0x899CE270, 0x89B12558, 0x00000000)

Now my problem is that when I get in to GRUB and go to Windows Professional XP SP2 it will give me the screen saying &quot;Windows did not shut down correctly&quot; and gives me the choice of safe mode, last known good config etc. I go on anyone of these and it will not get to the Windows loading screen as it seems to automatically restart. I then go to the advanced settings (F8) and try all of the options - none work.

I&#39;ve tried booting up with the Windows disk - Gets to Setup is starting Windows and then goes straight to the BSoD.
I&#39;ve tried using ERD Commander to get back in to Windows - Straight to BSoD.

I&#39;m fairly sure I will not be losing any truly important data, but there&#39;s a good 100GB of programmes, software, music, and video that I&#39;ve collected over the past few years, which I would prefer not to lose.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to get Windows back running normally again? If not, how do I go about re-installing Windows - Seeing as I can&#39;t use the Windows disk.

I&#39;m pretty stuck right now, and have no idea what to do from now on.

Any help much appreciated - willing to answer any Qs you may have.

PS - I can log on to Ubuntu and get to my WINDOWs files through there... I have tried using an external hd to transfer some data through Ubuntu, but as soon as I reconnected my external to my computer, it was unable to mount. Any ideas?</description>

<p>The computer is relatively new, and I wouldn’t think it would be related to the BIOS. I can reset it and it does boot up in the order set no problem.

<p>The files are fine. I can read them in Ubuntu - I’m not sure what happened, but I will a transfer tomorrow. When my files are saved and secured, how would I go about reformatting my drive - noting I do not have access to Windows at all on this computer.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the help - I’ll see what I can do tomorrow. I better hit the hay as I have an English exam tomorrow <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

Maybe your “torrented” Partition Magic was a bit dodgy. I personally use a Linux Live CD when dealing with partitioning because nothing can get in the way and its definatly malware free.</p>
