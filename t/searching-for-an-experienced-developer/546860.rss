    <title>Searching for an Experienced Developer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/searching-for-an-experienced-developer/546860</link>
    <description>Hello and welcome,

First off, I&#39;d like to mention that my investor and myself are currently looking for someone experienced in programming RSPS&#39;s. 

We have the funds to pay anyone who we choose, to help develop the server in OUR direction that we want. We will pay you by the hours that you are online and programming the server, not all at once, unless chosen by yourself (Which will be after we see progress). The server will be a 317, but is open to change at our discretion, before you begin programming, of course. 

We will be looking for active, trustworthy, honest, and overall how experienced you are in programming a RSPS source. We will be communicating via Skype, so if this is going to be a problem, let us know beforehand. 

If we see progress and like how you&#39;ve developed for us, we may hire you on for future reference, but until then, you will be strictly developing the server.


Please Follow this Format
PM me your Skype username, past experience in Developing RSPS&#39;s, and what you think you could contribute to this. If we like what we see, we will contact you via Skype for an interview, which then will determine whether we hire you on or not.</description>
