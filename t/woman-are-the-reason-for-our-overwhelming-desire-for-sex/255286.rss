    <title>Woman are the reason for our overwhelming desire for sex?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/woman-are-the-reason-for-our-overwhelming-desire-for-sex/255286</link>
    <description>Well, I was thinking about it a lot. And I was thinking how men (as the minority) are overwhelmed with the desire of sex. So I was pondering why, Then it hit me when I was at school today. The way females dress are why we have the overwhelming desire. I was thinking well if they didn&#39;t dress this way would it be the same. So... This is a kind of a discussion of if you agree or disagree, and why. Also, I don&#39;t have a problem with the way they dress.</description>

<p>Very true statement, a friend of mine was asked about it by my friend, and she replied with “what girl doesn’t?”</p>
<p>The desire is simply testosterone.</p>

<p>so your basicaly blaming women for dressing well, looking good and having good healthy bodies.<br>
Yes, its clearly the womans fault that your oggeling her figure as she’s walking past.</p>
<p>Sexual attraction is a part of nature. And has been around since before woman looked hot.</p>

The thought about having sex just pops into my mind, wether i’m having fun or not.<br>
It really doesn’t have anything to do with your life being interesting or not.<br>
Just typing this sentence made me think about sex.</p>
<p>And i doubt that getting estrogen would make you think differently, i think it would make your titties bigger?<br>
Like your body would get more feminine.</p>

Yes, it would be the same. I went to a private school with uniforms all my life and they weren’t aloud to wear make up either. They can still attract you somehow.<br>

<p>exactly, and that’s why God/the universe “programmed” us to like attractive(healthy) people.<br>
Therefore healthy people would have more chance of reproducing than ugly people.</p>
