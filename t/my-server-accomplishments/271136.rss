    <description>Hello METAL here with my second post, 

Hello I&#39;ve been working on my server for quite  some time now. I&#39;ve went through error upon errors, I started with a blank original Moparscape server with no NPC&#39;s not even bankers. I worked and worked on my server till Miss Silabsoft released her client with the newer items I&#39;m currently Looking for a [377] server to work on if you have any suggestions read my first post (link at the bottom.)

[b]-Finished Working on-
- 15+ shops all with different items ( A weird goal I had.)
- Added newest items.
- 100% working wilderness levels.
- NPC&#39;s in the right places.
- My own dueling arena (That&#39;s right i have a a custom duel arena (not saying where.)
- 63 wave fire cape mini.
- And much, much more.
- 100% working specials ( who doesn&#39;t have this goal.)
- 100% working lunar (I&#39;ve got all but 3 spells working.)
- And other projects on working on[/b]

As a server programmer, a program programmer, and well html, php… All the other stuff, I suggest you do 1 step at a time. Learn slowly, finish 1 project, take a break, start another… And so on…</p>
