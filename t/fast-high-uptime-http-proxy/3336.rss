    <title>Fast high uptime http proxy?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fast-high-uptime-http-proxy/3336</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m looking for a fast http proxy that is almost always up. I had one a while ago but can&#39;t find it anymore. No, not one of those crappy cgi-web based proxies, just a IP and port number :)

Thanks. 

PS. Please dont tell me to use google, trust me I have been looking for like 2 hours and every proxy is down, and those that are up are extremely slow.</description>

              <p>If you just want it to hide yourself, planetlab has tons of them and one port on each is open to the public (lowest numbered port on the machine) . Several things about them though…</p>
<p>They do record what your doing, so if some site complains to them about you doing illigal stuff, they will give them your info.</p>
<p>http protocol only.</p>
<p>They have them all over the world, and they are very fast.</p>
