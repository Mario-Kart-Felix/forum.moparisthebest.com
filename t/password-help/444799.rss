    <title>Password? Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/password-help/444799</link>
    <description>I started &amp; ran my source this morning and had a few players on. It is an Allstar.
After a while they left and others started coming, so I was checking their passwords and one guy had this 

[code][ACCOUNT]
character-username = flang
character-password = 734161c3145a5cf47da28979d9ff2244e8e1b663

[CHARACTER]
character-height = 0
character-posx = 2857[/code]


The password of flang is like encrypted, but my server does not encrypt passwords.. In dereick0&#39;s account it is normal, how come one is encrypted and one is not? &amp; He logged on multiple times, so he couldn&#39;t have just remembered that long password or written it for a once time use.

[code][ACCOUNT]
character-username = dereick0
character-password = four4

[CHARACTER]
character-height = 0
character-posx = 3024[/code]</description>

<p>The logs say he possibly has duped items, which he did.</p>
