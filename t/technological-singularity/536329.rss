    <title>Technological Singularity</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/technological-singularity/536329</link>
    <description>The technological singularity is basically the point at which we create a machine that is smarter than ourselves, so we never need to create another machine. Do you think this will happen soon or even ever? Do you think we would create a machine that is superior intellectually with us? 

This can also stem into many other subjects such as uploading your mind into a computer, having cloud computing/memory storage with human beings so we are a collective intelligence and whatnot. Would you chose to upload your mind to a computer if given the chance to life forever (granted the computer never crashes :P)?

Machines are programmed to do what we tell them to do. It’s all limited based on human ability.[/quote]<br>
However, we can tell them to do something that humans are able to do that they can do in a shorter amount of time. For example, we could program a computer to test different ways to make smaller transistors without any human interaction. Then program a machine to use these transistors to make another computer. A computer better than one we could have created in the allotted time has just been created.<br>
My point is, we can program computers to use our knowledge to expand faster than we could imagine. Human brains are (obviously) more innovative than machines (they can’t innovate), but they do excel in many different areas where humans are lacking. Machines can do calculations almost unrealistically faster than humans can and they can work with a lot more information at a time. Saying they’re limited based on human ability is incorrect because by that logic calculators would take a lot longer to do simple functions (i.e. graphing, square roots)</p>

              <p>Personally I believe there to be myriad approaches to the solvability of such a profound question. Firstly, are humans actually able to solve all NP complete problems? What about NP hard? I sincerely doubt that the human brain is capable of solving an NP hard problem in the general sense, given any reasonable amount of time. But even taking this as a given - is the brain capable of solving problems that cannot be solved on a turing machine? If the answer to that question is no then I seriously suggest a complete re-evaluation of the pumping lemma and it’s tertiary connotations.</p>

The technological singularity is basically the point at which we create a machine that is smarter than ourselves, so we never need to create another machine. Do you think this will happen soon or even ever? Do you think we would create a machine that is superior intellectually with us?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, machines are already ‘smarter’ in certain ways than ourselves. Take for example a calculator or a computer.</p>
<p>If you meant cognitively, and the question is if AI will ever supersede us, I doubt it because the machine’s mind would be modeled after a human one. It is an interesting theory though.[/quote]<br>
But there are imperfections in the human mind, mostly the ability to recall memory. This is how I picture the brain processes and retains information. If you think of a tree you may think of other stuff that is related to a tree, such as leaves, bark, and twigs or the color green. And connected to bark may be a dog. These connections each have a “definition” attached to them as to how you remember they are connected. Also, when you are learning a new subject, you often create connections to things you already understand or know and then attach definitions to them. You could replicate this process easily by creating a massive node tree where nodes are connected to another and each connection has a definition. Such as atom is connected to diameter which is connected to length. If you had a program search all of the webpages online it could create a comprehensive database of connections and you could search it. This would be more efficient that a human because our ability to recall connections is based upon our memory. We also may take the long path around nodes to try and reach the connection. That is why when you are trying to remember something you go on the wrong path and you can never remember the right connection to the node. Or say when you go to ride a bike, they say you never forget. That is because all of the motor connections are still there, you just cannot remember them. However, when you start riding a bike you remember them and therefore remember how to ride a bike. I believe your brain records everything in memory, we just cannot recall it.</p>
<p>But yeah if you could create a similar system but the difference is allow it to create new nodes based on existing information it could problem solve and create discoveries. I see no reason why this system would surpass humans in the ability to problem solve and innovate.</p>
<p>Also, perhaps we will not create a machine, as that is violating a simple fact of darwinism. You simply do not introduce a superior creature into your environment. However, we may reverse engineer the brain and learn how to “upgrade” our brain and therefore become these machines we could create.</p>
<p>I’d also say calculators and computers are extremely stupid because I always get mad when I accidentally type 9.9 in the calculator and I meant 9.8 and the calculator didn’t know that I meant 9.8 because I was obviously doing a problem with gravity. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Guess I was a little to relative with the word smart but I meant by problem solving not computational power. There are humans that are faster than calculators btw. Really interesting once you look into it.</p>
<p>[quote=“Sfacciato, post:2, topic:536329”][quote author=The Wanderer link=topic=655141.msg4386927#msg4386927 date=1385943547]<br>
This can also stem into many other subjects such as uploading your mind into a computer, having cloud computing/memory storage with human beings so we are a collective intelligence and whatnot. Would you chose to upload your mind to a computer if given the chance to life forever (granted the computer never crashes :P)?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Hm, interesting but I’d have to decline because I value individuality and privacy. Would I take the chance to live forever? Never.[/quote]<br>
What is individuality? Being different just like everyone else? Seems like you aren’t that much different if everyone is different. But seriously, what is individuality? It is something humans created. We are just a bunch of atoms and chemical reactions. That is what emotions are. We can simulate emotions simply by stimulating neurons in the brain by electrical impulses. If you want to be sad in a computer it would be extremely easy to be so if we have reverse engineered the brain.</p>
<p>May I tell you why I would live forever and perhaps you may think again? I personally do not care if there is an afterlife or not and even if God himself came down and told me there was heaven I would still tell him I would not want to die, for once I die I cannot do any good. It doesn’t matter if I’m dead in a coffin or up in heaven, once I die I will not be able to help people out, therefore I want to be able to live forever so that I can always help people out and make the universe a better place.</p>
<p>[quote=“eyeownyew, post:3, topic:536329”]Moore’s law is expected to no longer be true for the first time very shortly FYI<br>

They have been predicting the end to Moore’s law since the 1980’s haha. Although once quantum computing becomes commercialized you won’t necessarily have to worry about transistors. Couple that with 3d optical memory storage systems and you have a supercomputer for everyone haha.</p>

<p>Well, machines are already ‘smarter’ in certain ways than ourselves. Take for example a calculator or a computer.</p>
<p>If you meant cognitively, and the question is if AI will ever supersede us, I doubt it because the machine’s mind would be modeled after a human one. It is an interesting theory though.</p>

<p>This can also stem into many other subjects such as uploading your mind into a computer, having cloud computing/memory storage with human beings so we are a collective intelligence and whatnot.

</aside>
<p>Hm, interesting but I’d have to decline because I value individuality and privacy. Would I take the chance to live forever? Never.</p>
