<p>Everyone is welcomed at TorvaX and all comments and tips are appreciated.<br>
Unfortunately you were banned due to talking about another server and were causing a racket!<br>

<p>Banning for causing a racket? You cannot hear people all they’re doing is typing. If it is that bad just ignore him if you’re so disturbed.</p>
<p>Servers are just full of authority-seeking kids these days. Banning people for all sorts of aids reasons. As if you have to be nice to everyone or you get banned.[/quote] Never advertise about another rsps  :palm: fact you have to lie thats when you know an rsps wont go far &amp; wasnt causing a racket either as I stated in my comment earlier you got mad because I said another pay to win  :rolleyes:</p>
