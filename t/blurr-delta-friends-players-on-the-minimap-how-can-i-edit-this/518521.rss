    <title>[Blurr/Delta] Friends/Players on the minimap (How can I edit this?)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/blurr-delta-friends-players-on-the-minimap-how-can-i-edit-this/518521</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had a lot of ideas that would involve making different colors on the minimap for different players.  I have searched around for anything that links the client to your friends list but I am  very clueless as to where I would find said properties.  If anyone could let me know how/where in the client this is added I would greatly appreciate it.</description>
