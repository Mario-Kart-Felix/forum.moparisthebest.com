    <title>Looking for developers and testers</title>

    <description>Hello I am looking for developers that can code a 667 revision RSPS. I am looking for experienced coders. You will get paid for doing some work. Not looking for dedicated coders. Also I am not going to be paying you a lot as well, eventually I will depending on how the server is progressing. 

Testers: I am looking for testers that can find bugs on the server. This isn&#39;t going to be a paying job.

              <p>Can you post more information? What’s the current progress of the server? How are you contributing beyond financing? “Experienced” coders is too broad. Do you want front-end or back-end developers? What kind of version control are you using? How anyone expects to get reliable help by posting brief and broad threads is beyond me.</p>
<p>I think we need moderators to clean this section up and hold the threads on this board to a higher standard. But then again, it’s just my opinion.</p>
