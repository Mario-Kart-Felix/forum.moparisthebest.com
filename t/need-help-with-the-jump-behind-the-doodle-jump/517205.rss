    <title>Need help with the jump behind the &#39;Doodle jump&#39;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-the-jump-behind-the-doodle-jump/517205</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to create a Doodle Jump-clone and I need some help with the logic behind the jump he performs.

I already know how to make the player jump up and let the platforms go down when the player reaches a specific boundary, but I need the jump to be more realistic.
Like.. you start your jump with a certain speed and you slow down when you reach the max height of your jump, and when you start falling your speed increases again.

How would you make a sprite perform such a realistic jump?

I hope I&#39;ve explained it well enough for everyone to understand.. if not, tell me :p

Thanks (:

Inb4 &quot;Wrong category&quot;: this isn&#39;t programming-related, it&#39;s more about the logic of a jump?</description>

<p>Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another, including objects ranging from atoms and photons, to planets and stars. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy (including light) cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present ...</p>
