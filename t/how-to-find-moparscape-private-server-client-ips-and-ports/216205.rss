    <description>Hello ima teach you today on how to find any private moparscape client ip or port like alcazar&#39;s client or project-pkz etc etc.

Difficulty:2/10

What you will need :DJ Java Decompiler which can be downloaded here:

[url=http://www.download.com/DJ-Java-Decompiler/3000-2417_4-10046809.html]www.download.com/DJ-Java-Decompiler/3000-2417_4-10046809.html [/url]

After you downloaded and installed everything open up dj dava compiler and screen should look like this:

Ima use Project pkz client for example click on file then click on open then look up your project pkz client folder,open it then look for a file called client.class or with the class format and click open on dj java compiler.

It should take a while to open dont worry that is normal since it is translating the client.class file to a java format.

After all the loading is finished and all the texts come up save it as client.java by clicking on file then click save as then a window should pop up.

Leave the name as client and make sure the file type is set to (java source files(*.java),then click on save.

When all that is done open the client.java you just saved with notepad.

When all the loading is done press (ctrl and f) at the same time then a find window should pop up.

Type in the Find What empty form: setserver

With no spaces at the begining and click Find Next.

Then it should show you setserver highlighted with the server ip next it with the port number right next to the server ip :).

Fuck all you flamers and plagerisers.

Oh yeah I almost forgot about the client.jar files if you cant find the client.class files :)

Im going to use alcazars client for example :)

Ok open up DJ Java decompiler and click on file then open, a window should pop op and look for the client.jar file the private server client brings and open it and your screen should look familiar to this:

Scroll all the way down till you find the client.class file

Select the client.class file and click on the Decompile option on the top

When the confirm window pops up just select click on No and the decompiling will begin

After its all finished your client.class file is saved to a jad format so it should be like this client.jad

This file is really a java format file, it is just saved into the jad format.

Ok now look up the client.jad file you just saved and open it with notepad and find setserver again
as i explained earlier and there you go, you found the ip and port next to the word setserver:)

And once again fuck all you flamers and plagerisers</description>

If they have a webclient, view the page source for the url where the jar is loaded from.</p>
