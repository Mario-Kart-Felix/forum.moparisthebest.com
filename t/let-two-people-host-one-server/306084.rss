    <title>Let two people host ONE server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/let-two-people-host-one-server/306084</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen this done before and wondered if it was simple enough that someone here could tell me how to do it.

Well, how would i host my server myself and allow someone else to be hosting it at the same time WITH THE SAME SERVER IP?</description>
