    <title>Someone w/ Teamviewer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/someone-w-teamviewer/329638</link>
    <description>I would appreciate if someone could help me make my own server. I have source and client and I&#39;ve switched everything out with my name and no-ip.biz name. I am also port-forwarding. I have set up  a static NAT. And I get: No response from server. Please try using a different world. I just thought it would be simpler if you had teamviewer to see what it going on whenever I try doing suggested ways of fixing. And yes I have a port set up on firewall to let it through.</description>
