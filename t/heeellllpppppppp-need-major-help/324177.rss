    <description>[size=20pt]SO ANYONE WHO HAS CURRENT EXPERIENCE W/CODING WILLING TO BE MY PARTNER IN CODING MESSAGE ME. I will setup a http for the server and when this goes big, half te profit will go to you. 50/50. I have already made a PS called stonedpkz(about 2 year ago it was big on xtremetop100, it was #3) so i halfway know what i am doing so i am not a complete NUB.[/size]


okay, had te get that out.. ^^^
Now, my problem is that i have a source, and i am atm making a server from it. I have the knowledge on how to code servers(made stonedpkz) but am a bit rusty(have not been near a pc in over 8 months)
So, that leads up to my question.
How do i edit what it says when you login, ex. &quot;welcome to ______scape&quot;.
or &quot;owner ______ has logged on&quot;.
MUCH MUCH MUCH appreciation to whoever can help me out.
IF anyone has aim,windows live or yahoo my SN for aim is sp0ok121, windows live messanger is cabellion@hotmail.com yahoo is thuglove4lyfe92.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE message me on either of those for your assistance!

PS&gt; dont think tat that is all my question and what i need help with. I have ALOT more questions to ask on this because i am using a 317 not a 508 source.</description>

              <p>Well, just add it yourself then. Because you obviously have a pretty empty source. I’m not going to sit here and type a long reply all night. I have to be to my classes in 3 hours. So I want to get a little sleep atleast. But yeah, all I can tell you is try to add it yourself. Download any random server, or use an old client. Try the old copy and paste trick.
