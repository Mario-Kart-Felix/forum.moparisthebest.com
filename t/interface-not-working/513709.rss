    <title>Interface not working?</title>

    <description>Hey everyone

I was testing some things, and this didn&#39;t work for me?

This is done on an InnovationX source and client which I downloaded to look at because I was bored. I went into the Client.java and I was interested to see how they did the pets for donors back in the day, I attempted to do my own and this happened:

[code]if (NpcType == 198) {
					if(HasItemAmount(600, 1)) {
					   showDialogue(&quot;You already have one of these books, my friend.&quot;);
					   return;
					 }
					showDialogue(&quot;He remains quiet, and hands you dat book.&quot;);
					addItem(600, 1);[/code]

When I click on the NPC, which I just randomly spawned in using ::npc 198 1 it wouldn&#39;t give me the item I wanted (book).

What am i doing wrong??</description>
