Im letting this post run for 11 days.

[code]Ok, so i have been working on this server for a while now.

Unfortunatly, i cant do everything so I would like to start my own team of developers.

Rules:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. You must contribute.
[center]Contribution guide-lines[/center]
Example of a good contribution
-----------------------------------------------------
If someone on our dev team, is making quest. I consider that, a good contribution. (even if it takes them a week or two)

Example of not contributing
-----------------------------------------------------
I do not consider spawning 5 npc&#39;s a contribution. (especialy if this is once a week).

2. Follow server, and forum rules.
[size=8pt]Thats pretty self explainatory.[/size]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I do not expect you to be able to get on the server every day of every week.
BUT I do expect you to log-in one time each month, unlesss you notify me of leave.

Anyone that is on the development team, and decides to leave will be put into Retired-Developer on forums, and on the game.

Im going to be honest and tell you what I can do.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I can make...

Npc&#39;s

Shop&#39;s

Commands (teleport, get item)

Renaming spell book

Alter locations (Home, teleports, portals)

I can create portals

Create Dialogs

Things I am learning how to do.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make quest

Make customs

Make a webclient &lt;--- Having lots of trouble with this one. &gt;.&gt;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


All developers will get admin rights on forums. 
( title will be developer, but you can do everything an admin can do )

The exeption to this is that, if you decide to leave the development team you will lose all admin rights.
You will get regular player rights.

Things I would like help with.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Making new areas for players.

Making more customs.

Adding new dialogs

Making new quest&#39;s.

Makng a web-client.

I also want to make new Pvp, Funpk, and Mini-games for the server.

Hosting a server. (not completly neccissary as we can alwyas buy one)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Donations to the server will be divided evenly once all fees are paid off. ( Hosting, website, ect.)

For Temporary website, Pm me.

Any questions, about what I can do, what I want you to do, or anything else just Pm me or email me at...
Mexokisee@hotmail.com

Leaving Saturday to go on vacation.
Leaving thread alone for one week, Then I will notify any or all who wish to be apart of a new server, and wants to make some money.
