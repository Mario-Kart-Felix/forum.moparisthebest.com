    <title>Unable to resolve DNS sometimes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unable-to-resolve-dns-sometimes/415788</link>
    <description>I have an interesting problem. I recently moved and changed my internet setup. I have a Netgear CGD24G-1CHNAS Cable Modem/Router with four computers wired in. Each computer has everything set manually and everything is correct. I can browse, download, and stream everything perfectly. I&#39;m getting 18Mbps D and 2Mbps U from Charter.

The problem comes from any kind of torrenting application. Even just starting one and having one torrent seeding at 20Bytes will screw up my connection for that computer. Whenever I browse at the same time, I get this error in Chrome (and others):

Error 105 (net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED): Unable to resolve the server&#39;s DNS address

This only happens for the computer that was torrenting. All others can browse fine. If I restart the router, I can browse fine on that computer as well. Torrents will download and upload at great speeds, but I literally can&#39;t browse until I restart the router. It will continue even if I stop the torrent application for a while.

Also, it is independent of OS. This happens on my Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.</description>

              <p>Since you said it fixed itself if you reset your router, I think it’s pretty clear something is wrong with your router.  Can you install DD-WRT or similar on it?  The problem probably manifests itself with torrents because of the sheer number of TCP connections it has to hold, it probably over-flows some buffer or something.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could turn off TCP torrent connections and make your torrent applications only use the new uTP protocol, it goes over UDP, which is stateless, so there are no connections to hold and no buffers to over-flow.</p>

              <p>Probably wrong but could it be something to do with port forwarding? Used to have sort of the same issue where I would be torrenting but connection almost no connection through a browser. Did some fiddling in my router and managed to solve the problem more or less. Have you tried restricting the download speed limit on the torrent client?</p>
