    <description>Ok, so I recently had to reinstall windows on my comp because my files got corrupted.
So now I have my cpu back and working and I lost everything that was on my desktop but not in my c drive. But when I go to add/remove hardware pretty much none of that stuff is inside there. Only the recent stuff I added for my computer to work.

Now, when I go to download java it stops halfway through and I get this error http://java.com/en/download/help/error_25099.xml  the only problem is that it says try to remove java, but I don&#39;t have it installed though I do have the Java folder in my c drive. Then it says to check to see if something else is running but its not. I really want to start working on my server again. I just added a few things but I can&#39;t run it =(

P.S I though this was funny.
 this is from a guy that will help you if you pay.
