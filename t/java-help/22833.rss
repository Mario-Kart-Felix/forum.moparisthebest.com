    <description>When I try to install Jre 5 update 6 I get an error saying that JavaTM cannot retrieve version information from the targeted directory. And then I cannot do anything with java...Uhm can anyone help =\


Q: Error 1722. There is a problem with this windows installer package. A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected. Contact your support personnel or package vender.

A: This is caused by previous unsuccessful install/uninstall of software through MSI engine. This problem will usually disappear if the users run the installer again. 

But It doesnt go away so......</description>
