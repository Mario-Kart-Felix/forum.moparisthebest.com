    <description>I recently came back from rsps after i quit. I starting coding again and when i tried to compile, it wouldn&#39;t work. So first i try the environment variables start testing things there. After a bit I couldn&#39;t find the problem so I try to run the client, That wouldn&#39;t work now it says &#39;java&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. Can somebody please pm me or post the problem, i know that the environment variables are screwed but i don&#39;t know how to fix, this will help a lot. Thank you
