    <description>Can someone please do this assignment for me please? thanks.

A- Create a class called &quot;ReportCard&quot;, with the following attributes:



•StudentName as String
•grade as integer

This class should also have the following methods:


•A constructor - to build an instance of &quot;ReportCard&quot; with name and grade given as parameters
•ConvertGrade - to convert the given grade into a letter grade and return it as a String
You can use the following table for conversion

Grade above 95 = A
85 to 95 = B
75 to 85 = C
70 to 75 = D
Below 70 = F



B- Create a class called &quot;ClassRoom&quot; - This class should contain your main method and do the following:


1.Create an array of 10 ReportCards
2.Give each member of the array any StudenName and grade that you wish
3.Loop through the array, call the ConvertGrade method of the object and print the student&#39;s name and letter grade on screen


Thank you so much, if possible - could you reply or private message me with the answer quickly?</description>
