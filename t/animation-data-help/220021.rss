    <title>Animation data - HELP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/animation-data-help/220021</link>
    <description>Could do with a little help finding the ALL the animation data.

In Benski&#39;s file loader the missing data seems to be :-
someoffset5 =  triangle priority
someoffset7 = triangle skinning groups 
someoffset2  = vertex skinning groups

The triangle skinning groups for barrelchest looks like this :-
[IMG]http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc76/MrPotatoHead2/barrelchest2.jpg[/img]

And the triangle skinning groups for the easter bunny look like this:-
[IMG]http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc76/MrPotatoHead2/easterbunny.jpg[/img]

Both models have lots of vertex skinning groups, but the easter bunny only has one triangle skinning group. 

QUESTION: Could the triangle skinning groups just be Debug data? i can&#39;t see the need for them.

Using the 317 cache :-
Seq.dat contains 3,547 sequences that look like this :-

sequence 5
01 08 
0CF3 FFFF 0000 
0CFA FFFF 0000 
0D00 FFFF 0000 
0CDA FFFF 0000 
0CE1 FFFF 0000 
0CE8 FFFF 0000 
0CEE FFFF 0000 
0CF4 FFFF 0000 
00 

This seems to rotate a group number(eg. F3) about a point number (eg. 0C)

Point numbers might refer to the center of all the vertices in a group, which can easily be calculated. Or they might point to the spot anims. or both.
Anyone know? 

We need to find the rest of the animation data, there isn&#39;t enough here to tell the client what to animate.

If you look at Anim_index, the maximum value in this file is 03C9 = 969.
There is also a folder called cache2 containing 969 files, i&#39;m guessing this is the missing animation data. Scary.

Also need to find out what Anim_crc and Anim_Version do and where they are used in the client. 
Lastly we need to know how the animation is linked to the object or npc.
Is that info in the object.dat and npc.dat?

Any help appreciated - even if you think it&#39;s stupid.</description>

              <p>WOW - thanks for that.</p>
<p>Was looking at the calculatenormals() from model.class yesterday, figured out</p>
<p><code>            int l4 = dist2to1Y * dist3to1Z - dist3to1Y * dist2to1Z;
            int i5 = dist2to1Z * dist3to1X - dist3to1Z * dist2To1X;
            int j5 = dist2To1X * dist3to1Y - dist3to1X * dist2to1Y;</code></p>
<p>was a cross product needed for rotating vectors.<br>
So the face skins ARE needed, will have to get someone to test some model hacks, see just what face skins are needed.</p>
<p>Trying to work out what the animation data in the files mean and how they work together.<br>
In the 317 you have 604 spot anims, 3547 sequences from seq.dat, and 969 anim files.</p>
<p>Will have a good play with this when i find out why my hard drive is going CLACK,CLACK,CLACK,CLACK <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>This is obviously 2 weeks late, but I didn’t know if you have figured it out yet.<br>
The following code is from my cache/model viewer/animator/whatever you want to call it… it worked previously, not sure if it still does with all this new shit Jagex is making.<br>
Feel free to rename/mangle/fuck with anything you want.</p>

<p>You’ll probably want to start with applyAnimationFrame() in Model.java</p>

              <p>Thanks for the link, they use the simple skinning method.</p>
<p>Not exactly sure what you mean, if you mean during the animation, that’s what i’m trying to figure out.<br>
Vertices are loaded first, but only triangles are drawn.<br>
Pretty sure they only rotate the vertex groups, it’s faster.</p>
<p>Found the loader for the 969 files it’s class36, method529.<br>
Loads from client class processOnDemandQueue()</p>
<p>can’t figure out what the Nodes are doing though, seems to be creating something, must take some time out to learn java.</p>

<p>Jagex probably uses methods which are available in this power point presentation.</p>
<p>A question though, which is calculated first, the triangle or vortex groups?</p>
