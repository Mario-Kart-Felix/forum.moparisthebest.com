    <description>I have made any new upgrades in a week, then today i open up the folder compile and then run 0 errors compiling.... but when i run it i get this, i never have editted it and yet, it gets an error.... 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Starting fr33sc4p3 Server on 0.0.0.0:43594
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: &quot;/
/STABATTACK&quot;
        at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(Unknown Source)
        at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Unknown Source)
        at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Unknown Source)
        at ItemHandler.loadItemList(ItemHandler.java:313)
        at ItemHandler.&lt;init&gt;(ItemHandler.java:39)
        at server.main(server.java:30)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If anyone who is obviously smarter than me can help it would be nice, by the way, i tried searching for the &quot;Error&quot; and i could not find anything within the sort.  And yes, i did search itemhandler.java and stuff... And yes, i am SMART enough to make myself a backup but i tried that already It Don&#39;t Work.</description>
