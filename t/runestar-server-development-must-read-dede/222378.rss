    <title>RuneStar Server Development (MUST READ DEDE)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runestar-server-development-must-read-dede/222378</link>
    <description>[center]This is not my first server development i have ever hosted. This is actually about my 3rd however i have quit due to school and such for about 1  year and now im back and alot has changed. So I am going to put together a team to start a server and forums. I will be buying a domain as soon as I get a team I already have 90USD on my paypal. After the server has been running for about a week I will buy a dedicated server to host.

I do need a very good team on this because I will be making money from this server and as will you if you are part of the team. The payoff will be around 10-20 a month depending on the server sales and salary made.

I am currently stuck blank as of now So if you feel I should add anything more please let me know.
MY MSN IS: s_t_4_r@hotmail.com

For anyone messaging me please. I AM NOT USING a source that has been custom made. I will use a source such as winterlovers or RS2DV anything that is stable and we can add on. so agian post here your questions comments or concerns.

MY MSN IS: s_t_4_r@hotmail.com

Or you can message me on MSN. I live on the east coast so I may not reply depending on your time zone.
The team Will consist of:
Coders now there will be two types of coders.
SERVER CODERS: I will do most of the coding but I would love advice from higher ranked members who know what there doing to help.
-
-
-

WEBSITE CODERS: website coders will just incorporate the server into the site such as making webclients and mysql based things.
-
-


Suggestioneers: These people will give me ideas on how to improve the website and server but will also tell me what I need to do to get this done.
-
-

Forum Coder: I could easily do this myself but i need someone who knows basic smf coding to do this because I am busy with other things. They will need to make boards and basic topics
