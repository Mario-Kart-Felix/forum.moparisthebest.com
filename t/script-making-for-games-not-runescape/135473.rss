    <title>Script making for games, not runescape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/script-making-for-games-not-runescape/135473</link>
    <description>Well, the only program i know of to make scripts for games on the internet is Scar.  It is a great program but it is just too slow for my needs and isn&#39;t advanced enough.

Also I&#39;ve heard of things written in Java which are must faster, but i haven&#39;t heard of a program that i can make a script in like that or a way to do it.

My question - is there a good program out there that I can write scripts for games in on the internet other than Scar?  If you have heard of Ibot/Nexus, then i love how that is set up for making scripts but it only works for RuneScape and i don&#39;t want to make scripts for RuneScape.

Anyone know of other methods to make scripts for games or other programs that i can make scripts in?</description>
