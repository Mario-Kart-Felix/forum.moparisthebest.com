    <title>Clicking/rearranging/adding buttons/tabs, - Basic Client help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clicking-rearranging-adding-buttons-tabs-basic-client-help/544650</link>
    <description>Basically what I need to know is how to change the placement of, adding new, and re-configuring buttons within a client.
I found out that most of the client modifications are within the cache, not the client file, but can&#39;t figure how to configure them :\...

What I need/would like  to change/modify about the client I dowloaded:

1.) Change &quot;Log-out&quot; tab from a sign? To the actual door.

2.) Add the &quot;Reset Xp&quot; option to xp counter.

3.) How to Remove what is currently in quest tab for &quot;click commands&quot; such as - &quot;open Items kept on death; open quick chat; xp lock [enabled]; ETC.&quot; and how to change them to what I wish for them to be such as &quot;teleports; staff online; skill teleports; ETC&quot;

4.) (What everyone has/wants) How to add a fully functional Money Pouch - in the correct spot.

5.) How to add fully functional and working curses.

6.) How to change the &quot;oldschool&quot; skill icons to the newer versions.

If you can be of any help, I would HIGHLY appreciate it! Thanks so much!</description>
