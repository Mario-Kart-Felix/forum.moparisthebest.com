<p>I’m doing that atm, it’s fucking me over big style and is very immature. I need to have tolerance for what I don’t want to do and do them like any other person. I’m sure many people find things I find hard and just don’t decide not to do them because they don’t understand it instantly etc.</p>

<p>My lack of willpower to do anything I don’t like. I don’t do lots of things I should do because I don’t want to.</p>
<p>Thanks for the info guys, I feel like pointing out I said </p><blockquote>I’m just wondering how people amplify their will to change to actually real life changes in their life.</blockquote><br>
Maybe, I worded the OP badly (please forgive me if I have, in my defence I’m ill as shit) but the quote I just stated means I want to know how you actually do it in real life. I already know a pretty good breakdown of what I need to do, I don’t know how to do it in real life though. I’m pretty bad at forcing myself to do things. I only tend to do things when I have a girlfriend buuut I don’t want a girlfriend right now.

If you wish to have a positive change, then set your goal(s) and pursue them, and have people you trust backing you up the whole way. Sometimes, in order to go through an actual change would mean giving something up in return. So be prepared to cut the fatty foods if you want to lose weight, for example.</p>

              <p>Family and friends support was what pushed me into muay thai which has now lead me on to MMA. Back when I was 13 (like a lot of 13 year olds) I always thought I was fat (looking back it was really just puppy fat) but they pushed me into boxing to lose weight and gain muscle and honestly without the gym etc I wouldn’t be who I am today. Besides being able to take care of myself in a fight against bullies or anything like that it taught me proper health care and how to keep myself in good shape. Just keep your family behind you pushing you the whole way and you’ll be able to do anything you want to do, or at least thats how I see it.</p>
