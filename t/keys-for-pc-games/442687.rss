    <description>A few years ago I bought Halo CE for my computer.  When I moved a while ago I lost the game, but found it a couple weeks ago when I was cleaning my basement.  I just loaded it up, (on a new computer by the way.  I have no idea where the other one is), and it&#39;s asking me for the product key.  Is there any way I can get by without the key since I already put it in once for this disk?  Any help is appreciated.</description>

<p>Restarted it and nothing happened.  And it says I have enough space to do it on the previous screen, but stops at 1% and gives the error I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>The key should probably be with the disk. Otherwise, contact bungie.[/quote]</p>
<p>The key isn’t on the disk, and the website for help for this game isn’t even being hosted anymore.  lol</p>
<p>Anyway, I just asked my friend for his and it worked <span class="bbcode-s">so this can be locked/ deleted.</span></p>
