    <title>Need help with my 43594 port</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-43594-port/360057</link>
    <description>Okay, i have my port forwarded CORRECTLY and everything. The problem is my ISP is blocking my port. Is there any way to fix this or make my ISP stop blocking that port? It&#39;s really getting on my nerves. Or atleast tell me another rsps port i can use besides 43594, and 5555 because my ISP blocks both of those.</description>

Okay, i have my port forwarded CORRECTLY and everything. The problem is my ISP is blocking my port. Is there any way to fix this or make my ISP stop blocking that port? It’s really getting on my nerves. Or atleast tell me another rsps port i can use besides 43594, and 5555 because my ISP blocks both of those.<br>

<p>You can run a rsps on almost any port you want, 43594 and 5555 are just the ones people have been using for a long time, also because Jagex uses them. Go to your ISP provider and ask or look for a list of blocked ports, use a port that isn’t on the list.[/quote]<br>
Thanks man:D. I appreciate it.</p>
