              <p>[quote=“Michaelmmm, post:7, topic:284096”]alright i get the right hand shit, the reason i put it on left hand is cause silentcj’s tut said to put a wep in the left hand so i was like k ill folow the fuckin tut?</p>
<p>Link for MQO Please?</p>
<p>And The file that i would edit to raise the sword would be .dat? the final one that i gzip for the client or what?</p>
<p>Oh and i’m sorry for being a fuckin idiot, NOT ALL OF <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">US</span></span></span> CAN UNDERSTAND THIS SHIT!</p>
<p>-As i said i STATED I STARTED TODAY 100%%%%%%%% So i BARELY know anything,once i get the hang of it, i will release MANY models for every one![/quote]</p>
<p>You obviously didn’t read the tutorial right then.</p>
<p>Taken straight from it.</p>
<p>[quote=“SilentCJ, post:1, topic:275142”]Look in the bottom left, when the wield model is selected, select right hand animation from the drop down menu, and set the priorities to 10 in the little text box. Outlined in red are the three things you will need to do, make .dat, being the last.</p>
<p><img src="http://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll63/Silent_CJ/AnchorConverting.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">For the drop/inventory model, you do not need to add animation, just select no animation from the ddm.</span>[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh and, don’t complain about the tutorial, give some appreciation, i took the time and effort to write it up.<br>
Also, for your information, everything i know today, i did without tutorials, when i started modelling and using rsps clients, no tutorials even existed, i started the modelling here at moparscape off. I worked out everything myself, so you can do so yourself.</p>

<p>last post</p>
<p>now since it took you 2 mins to make it, read the WHOLE TUTORIAL this way you dont need to ask questions to us seem <em>dumb</em></p>
<p>i am sorry people are being mean but when you come into this section we already assume that you read the tutorial teaching you the basics</p>
<p>please read the tutorial and i hope to see a lot of awesome models in your future <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>RECOMMENDED: make something very easy, for example a smile face on a cape, (dont post that, just for your own benefits)</p>
<p>good luck</p>

<p>omfg… what has the world come to?<br>
if you look at the fucking picture im pretty sure your guy is holding the sword in his RIGHT HAND!<br>
its bc the new rs character is different from the old rs character and therefore the models are different and wont look right on the old character…<br>
You should try finding some common sense, it would help us all.</p>
