    <title>I think I must be missing something</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-think-i-must-be-missing-something/59436</link>
    <description>Okay so i read pretty much everything I could on this forum that will help me. I downloaded Hamachi and Moparscape 3.2 w/Aryan. On Hamachi I go to creat new network and type in the Network name and password. Then a lot of names come up saying no one is logged in. So i go back to moparscape and type in the IP address and it always says &quot;error connecting to server.&quot; Can someone please help me.</description>

              <p>What??? you tried to join a network and no one was on-----this is easily sorted…wait for the owner to log onto hamachi then ask him if the server is up and if yes use his hamachi i.p adress (shown above the chat text or next to his name) …there ya go easily sorted</p>
