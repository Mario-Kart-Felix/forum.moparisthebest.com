    <title>BeanShell &#39;Commands&#39;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/beanshell-commands/225333</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to switch to using BeanShell as my Java Scripting language. I was reading the User Manual and got to the part about commands, and how you can add them. (By adding script files with the commands name to the classpath)

However I&#39;m loading the scripts from MySQL. But I need a way to have methods that every script can access. Really what I&#39;m doing is handling objects clicks in a server with scripts. However if the user clicks a Tree for example, I would like to be able to call a woodcutting method. Obviously there is more then one tree object, and copying and pasting the code into every script is a terrible idea.</description>

              <p>Ok, as far as I can see this is very simple.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public loadSQLtoString() {
//Load your SQL base to a string
}

public mainMethodHere() {
       loadSQLtoString();
       Interpreter i = new Interpreter();
       i.exec(STRING_HERE);
}</code></pre>
<p>Maybe make I a public variable, up to you, make sure you use “i” rather than creating new interpreter instances, by executing all the code, all your effectively doing is loading them to memory.</p>
<p>Now, if your script is some sort of auto-run, rather than just a bunch of methods, like maybe a JavaScript for an autoer, you would load the scripts to a hashmap, from SQL. From that point, all you do is i.exec(HASHMAP.get(“SCRIPT_HERE”));</p>
<p>Hopefully you understand what I mean.<br>
The first is if your not loading a “script” as such, but a bunch of commands that will be used later on during runtime.<br>
The latter for running “auto-run” scripts.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 18, 2008, 05:29:22 pm[/size][hr]FYI, I used BeanShell on my IRC bot in the past, it’s leet for calculations, or anything really.</p>
<p>I also incorporated it into an RSC Bot, which was connected to IRC, it allowed me to view different variables during runtime, which meant I could get different values at different points in time etc.</p>

<p>If I’ve understood your question correctly, I’ve had to do something similar in the past. I created a standard Java class containing the methods I needed to access from scripts, then used <a href="http://www.beanshell.org/javadoc/bsh/Interpreter.html#set(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object)" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">set()</a> to move that class as an object into the interpreter. The code looked like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Thingy thing = new Thingy();
...
inter = new Interpreter();
inter.set(thing.getName(), thing);</code></pre>
<p>If getName() returns, say, “pie”, then all BSH scripts on that Interpreter could do this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(pie.isTasty()) {
  eat();
} else {
  cry();
}</code></pre>
<p>pie.isTasty() would be calling the real Java method, thing.isTasty().</p>
<p>edit: and before you ask, Pwnd, I used Beanshell so that my end users could add code without the bother of compilation or the risk of destroying my beautiful core engine code <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Yea with Java, but implementing server-side scripting isn’t. I’m using Jython right now, but BeanShell would probably be a better choice because of the syntax, and its going to be included in the J2SE at some point. If you have a good alternative I’ll listen.</p>
