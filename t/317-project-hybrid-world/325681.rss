              <p>[quote=“Berky-Scape, post:5, topic:325681”]It’s a nice server but I think these servers just ruin the love for the 317’s.<br>
Like the old ways, old pickaxes old textures, old everything. It’s just nice, and now people are making 317’s into 525’s…<br>
That doesn’t have any sence, just edit a 525 into yours, why making a big deal about it?<br>
I think 317 is an old 317 nothing more.<br>
If you wan’t HD and new rs go make a 525 or 508 or go play real Runescape.[/quote]</p>

<p>Yea i know, no-one will though, These new coders want a stable and easy to understand base, which would be an un-packaged base, but hyperion, iClarity, emulous, final devo 2.7 are all packaged. I personally think that we need to almost refactor hyperion abit, and make it easier for new coders to understand.</p>
<p>And yes i’m probably going to get flamed for this, but rs2hd, rs2dv, and Hyperion frameworks are all immensely confusing when you start out, and not many people want to download an IDE.</p>
<p>ALso, final devo it nulled pretty bad, once every 20 mins or so, i had around 30 online for testing, and it wasn’t too good. Might have been some shitty coding on my part, i don’t know, it was my second source so i really can’t judge it.</p>

Also, IF your using Delta, I recommend you to switch to either iClarity, Devo 2.7 or Emulous, those are better bases and are easy to code with (Both iClarity and Devo 2.7 already have great combat added). Also, if you want an challenge, you could always go Hyperion.  ;D<br>

alright i disagree with this, i coded final devo 2.7 and seeing as how most of the stuff he added has been content and not too much gameplay if he goes 2.7 he will fail most likely because final devo has no null handling.<br>
iClarity isn’t bad, i like it, but personally i prefer emulous combat better.</p>
<p>Also hyperion would confuse the shit out of this guy, none of the variables / voids / booleans are remotely similar to wL, and he also probably would have a hard time understanding the packaging.</p>
<p>Personally man, id stick with delta for now if this is your first source because you can just c &amp; p large amounts of code from delta to other sources later on.[/quote]</p>
<p>I do have to agree that Devo 2.7 will fail if he’s new to coding.<br>
Second of all, I did say “if you want a challenge, you could always go Hyperion.” I don’t expect or recommend him to do it.</p>
<p>But I don’t want to argue, didn’t think before posting. Sorry.<br>
O’ well, once again, good luck. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>It’s a nice server but I think these servers just ruin the love for the 317’s.<br>
Like the old ways, old pickaxes old textures, old everything. It’s just nice, and now people are making 317’s into 525’s…<br>
That doesn’t have any sence, just edit a 525 into yours, why making a big deal about it?<br>
I think 317 is an old 317 nothing more.<br>
If you wan’t HD and new rs go make a 525 or 508 or go play real Runescape.</p>
