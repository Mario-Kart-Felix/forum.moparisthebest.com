    <title>Error connecting to server in client - But my server is still running correctly</title>

    <description>Hey all,

I have a problem. Yesterday and before yesterday my client did work for me. Now it doesnt. If I try to logg in it says &#39;Error connecting to server&#39;. That sucks because I already tried to solve this but nothing works. 

Also my server is still running correctly, current 3 players online lol. But just the fact. 

I had this before and I am using no-ip so I got it portforwarded and the server works good. 
The problem lies on the client. Please can you tell me some cautions? So I can look for them if I did something wrong?

Thanks ALOT if you help me. I like MoparScape because the members respond fast and also like to help :) I really like the members of MoparScape!

              <p>Make sure your client ip is set to your localhost ip (0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1). Only YOU need to be connected to your localhost ip. Others need to be connected to your no-ip ip that you set up.</p>

<p>Are you running needed programs to run it? i mean no-ip , utorrent or what you use?[/quote]</p>
<p>Using both to be sure the server works. No-ip works, uTorrent, but the problem is not there. The problem must be in the client I guess. My friends and players can still connect to the server except me.</p>
<p>EXTRA INFO: When I go go to adapter settings on my PC and right-click the network and then click properties, and if I change the IPv4 back to “Automatic chose an ip” or something, its called in dutch different, then I can go on internet again. But then my server goes off. And if I put the IP stuff back again at “Use this IP” or something (got dutch PC), then my internet does not work so good but my server does.</p>
<p>I think my server replaces my internet browser or something. Is there any fix for this?</p>
<p>TY for help</p>
