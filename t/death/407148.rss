    <description>How do you feel about the fact that one day life is going to apply the applyDead() method to you in real life? (no, you won&#39;t re-spawn).

I think most people will be like &quot;You live you die, so what&quot;, but deep down, I think you&#39;re scared. I&#39;m scared.

I want to live for ever. 

But nothing is for ever. Not the Earth, the solar system, the Milky Way or even the Universe.

So what&#39;s your approach on the subject?</description>

              <p>I’m not really sure what happens, but we’re all made of energy that all (or mostly) came from the earth. (Our origins are a mystery) and one day we will die and decay and return back into the earth eventually. This is evident. What happens with our consciousness is what has me puzzled. It surely has to be composed of energy too? Does it also return back into the earth, if so, how would that get reused? It’s not like consciousness can be broken down, or if it’s even consumable energy. So I’m not sure, but honestly who is?</p>

<p>Sorry for the prolonged response, was sick and didn’t really feel like debating and such.</p>
<p>I did not say that there was scientific evidence that there is an afterlife, I said that there is science behind their investigations. As far as the afterlife, that is my personal opinion on the matter. I don’t expect you to feel the same way.</p>
<blockquote>the EMF meter; digital thermometer; handheld and static digital video cameras, such as thermographic (or infrared) and night vision; digital audio recorder; and computer.</blockquote>
<p>Those are actual scientific equipment, not tailored for paranormal activity investigation. I am sorry if you thought I was insinuating that there was scientific evidence that there was an afterlife or that paranormal activity was a fact, because that was unintended.</p>

<p>I’m not scared of being dead, I didn’t exist once before, and I’ll just cease to exist then, too. I won’t know it, because I won’t be I, I just won’t be. Of course, I’m scared of how I am actually going to die, but that is just about it.</p>

<p>Also, I’m honestly more afraid of someone I care for dying rather than dying myself.  I’ve came to the conclusion that it’s going to happen (Hell, I’ve already seen 1 guy die, and 2 get severely injured at my workplace alone.) and I know that if it’s me that dies, I won’t know anything about it… but if it’s one of my parents/siblings then it’d actually hurt me emotionally, and that scares me more than me dying.</p>
