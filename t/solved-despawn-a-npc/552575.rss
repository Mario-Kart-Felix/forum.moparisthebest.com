    <title>[SOLVED]Despawn a NPC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solved-despawn-a-npc/552575</link>
    <description>Nevermind figured it out on my own, the solution was in the death method

I&#39;m trying to &#39;despawn&#39; a NPC at will but the way this code works makes flat out 0 sense. I&#39;ve tried to do it through firstclicking just to see if it would work.

From what I understand this should be enough to despawn a NPC:

[CODE]NPCHandler.npcs[i] = null;
NPCHandler.npcs[i].updateRequired = true;[/CODE]

So If I get the correct i (position in npcs list) for the mob, I should be be able to despawn it by nulling it right? Nope. This is my how my FIRST CLICK in clicknpc.java begins

[CODE]		case FIRST_CLICK:
			c.npcClickIndex = c.inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();
			c.npcType = NPCHandler.npcs[c.npcClickIndex].npcType;[/CODE]

Where I understand npcClickIndex should be the number of the npc in the npcs[] list? But every time I print this index out the value is 0. How can all the npcs be 0 on the list?
Then later in the code you see stuff like this (making the NPC face the player upon click) 

[CODE]NPCHandler.npcs[c.npcClickIndex].facePlayer(c.playerId);[/CODE]

Wat. How does that even work correctly if the value is always 0???? And why won&#39;t the damn NPC be deleted? Am I trying to delete it the wrong way?
