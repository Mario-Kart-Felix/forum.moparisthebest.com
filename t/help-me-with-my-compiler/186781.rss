oops never mind had to change to the _01 to _05 =] 


Ok I get an error when i try to compile my server saying:

&#39;javac&#39; is not reconized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file

and the compiler i use is this:
@echo off
javac *.java
pause

I also just set new envorimental variables. I think i may have messed up tho. I have jdk 6 update 5 and for my enviromental varibles  i did this for CLASSPATH:
CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_01\bin;%CLASSPATH%;

also i made a new system variable called PATH when there was allready a path un cap but it said make a new one:
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_01\bin

so does ny one know wuts up?</description>
