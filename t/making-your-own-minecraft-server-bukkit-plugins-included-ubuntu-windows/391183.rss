[size=24pt]Minecraft - Making your own server[/size]
[/center]


Well, my sticky was getting a tad to big and it was becoming increasingly hard to organize it. So in the end I decided to create a new threads regarding the creation of a Minecraft server - it already partly existed in my sticky but I removed it and decided to expand and place it here. I will try to go into as much detail and provide media for every single step which is done in this tutorial, as always I am open to feedback about anything, it can range from information errors to grammatical mistakes. 

I&#39;m going to do some background information before I begin on the main tutorial. First of all, if you&#39;re new to Minecraft I recommend you read my other tutorial. It covers a wide array of newcomer vocabulary and issues, as well as trouble shooting. So, let&#39;s begin (Over used phrase of mine, sorry!). But first all, the contents page!

[hr]

[size=18pt]Introduction[/size]
[anchor=introduction]

Okay, in the introduction I&#39;m going to try and get as much done as possible. This will include going over computer specs and player count. So, first of all, computer specs and what resources would be required. This also contains other general information. Before I go into what people say are the facts I&#39;m going to share with you my take on the situation. Many people claim you need a ton of RAM (Random access memory) to host a minecraft server but with my personal experience this simply is not the case. I&#39;ve ran Linux with 1GB RAM, 3.00 GHZ 1mb up and it&#39;s handled quite a few players lagg free - so please don&#39;t get sucked up into &#39;you can&#39;t host the server without 10GB RAM&#39; talk, it simply is not true.

But saying that, this doesn&#39;t mean you will get away all the time and host hundreds of players. That wasn&#39;t the message I was trying to send out :). Now that we&#39;ve gotten that cleared up we can move onto the factual areas of it. 

[i] What you really should have [/i]


[ul][li]Preferable a 1mb up + connection (This would be best in my view thought that may differ from person to person!)[/li][li]1GB + RAM (Again, personal preference)[/li][li]2.00GHZ + (Again, personal preference)[/li][li]A [b]Computer[/b][/li][/ul]

As you&#39;ve probably noticed a lot of this is personal preference, I run fine on these specz so I&#39;m comfortable with them. You also have to note I said computer and NOT laptop. Never should you host a server which requires a lot of resources at times be hosted 24/7 on a laptop - this is not good. 

The laptop will suffer a constant strain and the heat will potentially cause damage to the machine. [b] Get a computer if you&#39;re hosting 24/7[/b]. Once your laptop reaches a certain point (heat wise) it will automatically shut down to stop components dieing. Now we&#39;ve got that done let&#39;s move onto Minecraft versions.

http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history

This is the version history for Minecraft - I&#39;m not going to mention this a lot but I think it&#39;s worth reading ;)

[hr]

[size=18pt]What you need[/size]
[anchor=whatyouneed]

Now, part 2, what you need. In this part I&#39;m going to cover all the necessary downloads you will need to progress through with this guide - I recommend you put them all in one directory so you don&#39;t loose them as we carry on the steps. 

[i] List of things you need [/i]


[ul][li]WinRar - http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm[/li][/ul]


[ul][li]Java - http://www.java.com/en/download/[/li][/ul]


[ul][li]Minecraft - http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp[/li][/ul]


[ul][li]Bukkit - http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server[/li][/ul]

Once you&#39;ve got all of those, you can proceed reading this guide. Now we move onto setting up!

[hr]

[size=18pt]Setting up a server - Linux Ubuntu[/size]
[anchor=settingupserver]

And, now we move onto what you&#39;ve all been waiting for (The joy) setting the actual server up with all our downloads. I don&#39;t want this guide to be quite as long as my other one so I&#39;ll try and make this section as short and quick as possible. But before I do that I&#39;m going to recommend you use Linux! What is Linux you may ask?

&lt;blockquote&gt;Definitions of Linux on the Web:
an open-source version of the UNIX operating system&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That answers it. It is superior over windows in many ways. It&#39;s also best for hosting the server. You can find Linux (Ubuntu if you&#39;re new) here:

http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download

Just follow the instructions to install it. First of all I&#39;m going to cover setting up on linux Ubuntu - to do this I&#39;m going to be using SSH. So you will need to download Putty/ or use terminal. If your server is in another location then use Putty.

http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

Let&#39;s begin. First of all some basic commands.

[code=Commands]
cd /dirname/etc/etc - Goes to the specific directory
ls - displays all files in the directory you&#39;re currently in
java - once Java is installed, shows a prompt of useful information and reminders
passwd - changes the root password
nano textdocname - allows you to edit/read text files
ctrl + c - acts as a cancel feature
sudo - logs into admin priv
apt-get install package- install command
wget URL - downloads files from a direct URL
Java filename - Runs a Java app i.e .jar
[/code]

First of all we&#39;re going to download Minecraft_server.jar using the wget function, I&#39;ve found a direct link (Which wget requires) for this tutorial. So you do

[code=command]
wget directlink
[/code]

So we&#39;re going to do

[code=command]
wget s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftDownload/launcher/minecraft_server.jar?v=1298922308461
[/code]

This will download Minecraft_server.jar, when it has downloaded it should either go to Downloads or your current directory. This is where basic commands will come in such as &#39;cd&#39; and &#39;ls&#39;. Perform

[code=command]
ls
[/code]

To check what is in your current directory, while 

[code=command]
cd directory
[/code]

Will take you to the specified directory, e.g cd /bin/. We will end up using this later one, once you&#39;ve located the Minecraft_server.jar take note and move onto the next stage. Now we need to install Java, this is a very easy part. We&#39;re going to be using the apt-get install function. I&#39;m going to do some explaining.

&#39;apt-get&#39; - selects the package while the actual &#39;install&#39; part of it tells it what to do. e.g apt-get install nano - this would install nano if the package name was correct.

&#39;sudo&#39; - allows the user to do administration (Gives them admin privileges). 

Now that we&#39;ve got that cleared up, we&#39;re going to install Java. We simply run the following command in terminal.

[code=command]
sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre
[/code]

This will install the package we&#39;ve stated. Once that is installed go back to your old directory you took note of (Preferable make it in a file to prevent a ton of mess). We will go back by doing

[code=commands]
cd /your/dir/here
[/code]

So if mine was in /bin/ I would do

[code=commands]
cd /bin/
[/code]

Then we&#39;re going to actually run Minecraft_server.jar. 

[code=commands]
java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui
[/code]

Allow me to explain this code in more depth, the &#39;1024mb&#39;s are the amounts of RAM the JVM (Java virtual machine) can use.  The &#39;minecraft_server.jar&#39; is obviously the target file and the &#39;nogui&#39; is specifying no Graphical user interface. If you want to edit the actual files we&#39;re going to install a text editor called &#39;nano&#39;.

There are other methods but I like nano (For no apparent reason at all). We&#39;re going to use an old command &#39;sudo apt-get install&#39;


[code=command]
sudo apt-get install nano
[/code]

This will install &#39;nano&#39; which a text editor we can use to read/write to files. We will use it like this.

[code=command]
nano filename.type
[/code]

e.g

[code=command]
nano whitelist.txt
[/code]

With this installed you will be able to edit configuration files for your Minecraft server and various other things, this will also help us with our plugins later on in this guide. And that&#39;s it! I&#39;m just going to redirect you to a topic regarding port forwarding s there are so many things which people do wrong and so many various types, it&#39;s just not worth typing up. 

http://portforward.com/

That site covers everything you&#39;ll need to know to get your server started in regards to port forwarding. 

[hr]

[size=18pt]Bukkit - Plugins[/size]
[anchor=bukkitplugins]

Bukkit adapts your server for multiplayer use, without Bukkit multiplayer would be very different. It provides great mods such as big brother (BB) which are an anti-griefeing tool used by countless servers. In this part I&#39;m going to show you how to set it up. (On Linux)

First of all you&#39;re going to need to download it. 
http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server

[code=command]
wget URL
[/code]
To download the file, then

[code=command]
ls
[/code]

To check what&#39;s in the directory. And finally to actually run Bukkit we&#39;re going to be using a different run code from normal

[code=command]
#! /bin/sh 
BINDIR=&quot;$(dirname &quot;$(readlink -fn &quot;$0&quot;)&quot;)&quot;
cd &quot;$BINDIR&quot;
java -Xincgc -Xmx1G -jar craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
[/code]

We&#39;re going to use nano to do this. Type

[code=command]
nano 
[/code]

Then we&#39;re going to edit it with the run code, then do ctrl + o to save it. Then we have to do chmod to give it permissions to execute the code. We simply do

[code=command]
chmod +x Minecraft.sh
[/code]

This will give it +x which is executable, then we simply execute it everytime you want to launch Bukkit. And now for some basic information regarding plugins, if you want plugins then you can find them all at

http://plugins.bukkit.org/

That contains a vast library of plugins you can use, based on version etc again, if you want to download one, go to the &#39;plugins&#39; directory and then

[code=commands]
wget directlink
[/code]

It will then download it. If it&#39;s a .jar simply run your server as I showed you before, if it is a zip you can use methods such as

[code=command]
unzip file
[/code]

and then run your server - if a plugin is complex it will most likely contain instructions on setting things up such as SQL. 

[hr]

[size=18pt]General Problems[/size]
[anchor=genproblems]

Many problems can arrise with server performance as well as errors in setup so in this part I&#39;m going to try and target these problems.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not enough RAM! - Reserve the JVM more RAM by increasing the 1024, 512mb (XMX).
Can&#39;t keep up! - Reserve the server more resources
Can&#39;t find the package - The package you&#39;re trying to do something with does not exist&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These are just what spring to mind, if you find any please don&#39;t hesitate to post. I&#39;ll then add to this and hopefully fix them!

[hr]

[size=18pt]Miscellaneous[/size]
[anchor=miscellaneous]

I didn&#39;t really have much to say here, it was just for future reference. So for now I&#39;m going to leave this pretty much empty. I&#39;d also like to add in the future (soon) I&#39;m going to expand this tutorial into other Operating systems such as Windows, MAC etc..

But for now please submit any errors, or any feed back on the thread! Thanks :)


[i]Other usefull guides:
http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,472694.0.html

[/i]

[hr]

[size=18pt]Setting up your own server - Windows![/size]
[anchor=settingupserverwindows]
Most of you will know what Windows is, so I doubt I&#39;ll need to put an explanation. I&#39;m going to make this as short as possible and avoid all room for speculation about the Operating system itself.

[i] List of things you need [/i]


[ul][li]WinRar - http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm[/li][/ul]


[ul][li]Java - http://www.java.com/en/download/[/li][/ul]


[ul][li]Minecraft - http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp[/li][/ul]


[ul][li]Bukkit - http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server[/li][/ul]

This time we&#39;re going to download Minecraft_server.exe which can also be found at http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp Once you&#39;ve downloaded it create a new folder called &#39;minecraft&#39; in a specified directory. 

Then simply run the EXE file, it will then bring up a GUI (Graphical User Interface) - It will also make multiple files.

[IMG]http://i293.photobucket.com/albums/mm78/5frtgvhy/filesmadeexe.jpg[/img]

I&#39;m now going to explain what each of those individual files are responsible for, and what functions you can edit. This can be used across all OS - I just include it here. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[i] Files 

Banned-ips - contains all banned ips

banned-players - contains all banned playerNames

ops - contains the name of all servers OPS

Server - a log of everything printed out on the GUI

white-list - a list of names which are allowed to play your server if the whitelist function is enabled in properties. 
[/i]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now I&#39;ve left out properties because I want to go into more detail on it. Properties has a ton of stuff you can edit such as save name etc

&lt;blockquote&gt;#Minecraft server properties
#Sat Apr 16 21:23:33 BST 2011
level-name=world // save name
hellworld=false
spawn-monsters=true // spawn mobs?
online-mode=true // if this is true hacked clients won&#39;t be able to connect
spawn-animals=true // spawn things like pigs etc
max-players=20 // maximum players on your server at one time
server-ip= // ip of server
pvp=true // is playervsplayer on?
level-seed= // seed i.e Tom_BETA
server-port=25565 // server port number IP:PORTNUMBER
white-list=false // does it use the whitelist function stated above?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#39;s a brief overview of the properties file. Now that you&#39;ve ran the EXE the server is listening for connections on the specific port in the properties file, so remember to change that! If you need to portforward then simply use the following site.

http://portforward.com/

It will cover everything in regards to portforwarding your router.</description>

They can connect to my server, but if I try to, then it wont let me, so wouldn’t trying to connect to my localhost make others unable to see me etc?</p>

<p>NO-IP is just to shorten it, or make it easier to remember. Your IP alone would allow a person to connect, it’s just most people prefer NO-IP as they get to customize the name. I personally state this as common sense but I guess I’ll add more detail on that soon.<br>

No-IP is actually just a DNS redirection, having nothing to do with ports. Simply sign up with No-IP, download the DUC (after creating a DNS address). From there is the normal steps to portforward with your router.</p>

<p>Well in some cases it actually is, I wasn’t stating an ‘official reason’. I was stating a personal preference many people use. Though you’re right that is a good use of it, but not the only reason people use it  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>e.g</p>
<p>in the world of RSPS people use testscape.no-ip.biz because most clients don’t have a save feature, so people remember it. The same goes for Minecraft I would imagine, it also looks more appealing.</p>

[size=24pt]Minecraft - Making your own server[/size]<br>
[/center]</p>
<p>Well, my sticky was getting a tad to big and it was becoming increasingly hard to organize it. So in the end I decided to create a new threads regarding the creation of a Minecraft server - it already partly existed in my sticky but I removed it and decided to expand and place it here. I will try to go into as much detail and provide media for every single step which is done in this tutorial, as always I am open to feedback about anything, it can range from information errors to grammatical mistakes.</p>
<p>I’m going to do some background information before I begin on the main tutorial. First of all, if you’re new to Minecraft I recommend you read my other tutorial. It covers a wide array of newcomer vocabulary and issues, as well as trouble shooting. So, let’s begin (Over used phrase of mine, sorry!). But first all, the contents page!<br>
[hr]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"> Contents of this guide </span></p>

<p>[size=18pt]Introduction[/size]<br>
[anchor=introduction]</p>
<p>Okay, in the introduction I’m going to try and get as much done as possible. This will include going over computer specs and player count. So, first of all, computer specs and what resources would be required. This also contains other general information. Before I go into what people say are the facts I’m going to share with you my take on the situation. Many people claim you need a ton of RAM (Random access memory) to host a minecraft server but with my personal experience this simply is not the case. I’ve ran Linux with 1GB RAM, 3.00 GHZ 1mb up and it’s handled quite a few players lagg free - so please don’t get sucked up into ‘you can’t host the server without 10GB RAM’ talk, it simply is not true.</p>
<p>But saying that, this doesn’t mean you will get away all the time and host hundreds of players. That wasn’t the message I was trying to send out :). Now that we’ve gotten that cleared up we can move onto the factual areas of it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"> What you really should have </span></p>
<p>[ul][li]Preferable a 1mb up + connection (This would be best in my view thought that may differ from person to person!)[/li][li]1GB + RAM (Again, personal preference)[/li][li]2.00GHZ + (Again, personal preference)[/li][li]A <span class="bbcode-b">Computer</span>[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>As you’ve probably noticed a lot of this is personal preference, I run fine on these specz so I’m comfortable with them. You also have to note I said computer and NOT laptop. Never should you host a server which requires a lot of resources at times be hosted 24/7 on a laptop - this is not good.</p>
<p>The laptop will suffer a constant strain and the heat will potentially cause damage to the machine. <span class="bbcode-b"> Get a computer if you’re hosting 24/7</span>. Once your laptop reaches a certain point (heat wise) it will automatically shut down to stop components dieing. Now we’ve got that done let’s move onto Minecraft versions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history</a></p>
<p>This is the version history for Minecraft - I’m not going to mention this a lot but I think it’s worth reading <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>[size=18pt]What you need[/size]<br>
[anchor=whatyouneed]</p>
<p>Now, part 2, what you need. In this part I’m going to cover all the necessary downloads you will need to progress through with this guide - I recommend you put them all in one directory so you don’t loose them as we carry on the steps.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"> List of things you need </span></p>
<p>[ul][li]WinRar - <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D">http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm[/li][/ul]</a></p>
<p>[ul][li]Java - <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D">http://www.java.com/en/download/[/li][/ul]</a></p>
<p>[ul][li]Minecraft - <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D">http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp[/li][/ul]</a></p>
<p>[ul][li]Bukkit - <a href="http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D">http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server[/li][/ul]</a></p>
<p>Once you’ve got all of those, you can proceed reading this guide. Now we move onto setting up!</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>[size=18pt]Setting up a server - Linux Ubuntu[/size]<br>
[anchor=settingupserver]</p>
<p>And, now we move onto what you’ve all been waiting for (The joy) setting the actual server up with all our downloads. I don’t want this guide to be quite as long as my other one so I’ll try and make this section as short and quick as possible. But before I do that I’m going to recommend you use Linux! What is Linux you may ask?</p>
<blockquote>Definitions of Linux on the Web:
an open-source version of the UNIX operating system</blockquote>
<p>That answers it. It is superior over windows in many ways. It’s also best for hosting the server. You can find Linux (Ubuntu if you’re new) here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download</a></p>
<p>Just follow the instructions to install it. First of all I’m going to cover setting up on linux Ubuntu - to do this I’m going to be using SSH. So you will need to download Putty/ or use terminal. If your server is in another location then use Putty.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a></p>
<p>Let’s begin. First of all some basic commands.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">cd /dirname/etc/etc - Goes to the specific directory
ls - displays all files in the directory you're currently in
java - once Java is installed, shows a prompt of useful information and reminders
passwd - changes the root password
nano textdocname - allows you to edit/read text files
ctrl + c - acts as a cancel feature
sudo - logs into admin priv
apt-get install package- install command
wget URL - downloads files from a direct URL
Java filename - Runs a Java app i.e .jar</code></pre>
<p>First of all we’re going to download Minecraft_server.jar using the wget function, I’ve found a direct link (Which wget requires) for this tutorial. So you do</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">wget directlink</code></pre>
<p>So we’re going to do</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">wget s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftDownload/launcher/minecraft_server.jar?v=1298922308461</code></pre>
<p>This will download Minecraft_server.jar, when it has downloaded it should either go to Downloads or your current directory. This is where basic commands will come in such as ‘cd’ and ‘ls’. Perform</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ls</code></pre>
<p>To check what is in your current directory, while</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">cd directory</code></pre>
<p>Will take you to the specified directory, e.g cd /bin/. We will end up using this later one, once you’ve located the Minecraft_server.jar take note and move onto the next stage. Now we need to install Java, this is a very easy part. We’re going to be using the apt-get install function. I’m going to do some explaining.</p>
<p>‘apt-get’ - selects the package while the actual ‘install’ part of it tells it what to do. e.g apt-get install nano - this would install nano if the package name was correct.</p>
<p>‘sudo’ - allows the user to do administration (Gives them admin privileges).</p>
<p>Now that we’ve got that cleared up, we’re going to install Java. We simply run the following command in terminal.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre</code></pre>
<p>This will install the package we’ve stated. Once that is installed go back to your old directory you took note of (Preferable make it in a file to prevent a ton of mess). We will go back by doing</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">cd /your/dir/here</code></pre>
<p>So if mine was in /bin/ I would do</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">cd /bin/</code></pre>
<p>Then we’re going to actually run Minecraft_server.jar.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui</code></pre>
<p>Allow me to explain this code in more depth, the '1024mb’s are the amounts of RAM the JVM (Java virtual machine) can use.  The ‘minecraft_server.jar’ is obviously the target file and the ‘nogui’ is specifying no Graphical user interface. If you want to edit the actual files we’re going to install a text editor called ‘nano’.</p>
<p>There are other methods but I like nano (For no apparent reason at all). We’re going to use an old command ‘sudo apt-get install’</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo apt-get install nano</code></pre>
<p>This will install ‘nano’ which a text editor we can use to read/write to files. We will use it like this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">nano filename.type</code></pre>
<p>e.g</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">nano whitelist.txt</code></pre>
<p>With this installed you will be able to edit configuration files for your Minecraft server and various other things, this will also help us with our plugins later on in this guide. And that’s it! I’m just going to redirect you to a topic regarding port forwarding s there are so many things which people do wrong and so many various types, it’s just not worth typing up.</p>
<p><a href="http://portforward.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://portforward.com/</a></p>
<p>That site covers everything you’ll need to know to get your server started in regards to port forwarding.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>[size=18pt]Bukkit - Plugins[/size]<br>
[anchor=bukkitplugins]</p>
<p>Bukkit adapts your server for multiplayer use, without Bukkit multiplayer would be very different. It provides great mods such as big brother (BB) which are an anti-griefeing tool used by countless servers. In this part I’m going to show you how to set it up. (On Linux)</p>
<p>First of all you’re going to need to download it.<br>
<a href="http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server</a></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">wget URL</code></pre>
<p>To download the file, then</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ls</code></pre>
<p>To check what’s in the directory. And finally to actually run Bukkit we’re going to be using a different run code from normal</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#! /bin/sh 
BINDIR="$(dirname "$(readlink -fn "$0")")"
cd "$BINDIR"
java -Xincgc -Xmx1G -jar craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</code></pre>
<p>We’re going to use nano to do this. Type</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">nano </code></pre>
<p>Then we’re going to edit it with the run code, then do ctrl + o to save it. Then we have to do chmod to give it permissions to execute the code. We simply do</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">chmod +x Minecraft.sh</code></pre>
<p>This will give it +x which is executable, then we simply execute it everytime you want to launch Bukkit. And now for some basic information regarding plugins, if you want plugins then you can find them all at</p>
<p><a href="http://plugins.bukkit.org/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://plugins.bukkit.org/</a></p>
<p>That contains a vast library of plugins you can use, based on version etc again, if you want to download one, go to the ‘plugins’ directory and then</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">wget directlink</code></pre>
<p>It will then download it. If it’s a .jar simply run your server as I showed you before, if it is a zip you can use methods such as</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">unzip file</code></pre>
<p>and then run your server - if a plugin is complex it will most likely contain instructions on setting things up such as SQL.</p>

<p>[size=18pt]General Problems[/size]<br>
[anchor=genproblems]</p>
<p>Many problems can arrise with server performance as well as errors in setup so in this part I’m going to try and target these problems.</p>
<blockquote>Not enough RAM! - Reserve the JVM more RAM by increasing the 1024, 512mb (XMX).
Can't keep up! - Reserve the server more resources
Can't find the package - The package you're trying to do something with does not exist</blockquote>
<p>These are just what spring to mind, if you find any please don’t hesitate to post. I’ll then add to this and hopefully fix them!</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>[size=18pt]Miscellaneous[/size]<br>
[anchor=miscellaneous]</p>
<p>I didn’t really have much to say here, it was just for future reference. So for now I’m going to leave this pretty much empty. I’d also like to add in the future (soon) I’m going to expand this tutorial into other Operating systems such as Windows, MAC etc…</p>
<p>But for now please submit any errors, or any feed back on the thread! Thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>[size=18pt]Setting up your own server - Windows![/size]<br>
[anchor=settingupserverwindows]<br>
Most of you will know what Windows is, so I doubt I’ll need to put an explanation. I’m going to make this as short as possible and avoid all room for speculation about the Operating system itself.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"> List of things you need </span></p>
<p>[ul][li]WinRar - <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D">http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm[/li][/ul]</a></p>
<p>[ul][li]Java - <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D">http://www.java.com/en/download/[/li][/ul]</a></p>
<p>[ul][li]Minecraft - <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D">http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp[/li][/ul]</a></p>
<p>[ul][li]Bukkit - <a href="http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D">http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server[/li][/ul]</a></p>
<p>This time we’re going to download Minecraft_server.exe which can also be found at <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp">http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp</a> Once you’ve downloaded it create a new folder called ‘minecraft’ in a specified directory.</p>
<p>Then simply run the EXE file, it will then bring up a GUI (Graphical User Interface) - It will also make multiple files.</p>
<p><img src="http://i293.photobucket.com/albums/mm78/5frtgvhy/filesmadeexe.jpg" alt width="429" height="164"></p>
<p>I’m now going to explain what each of those individual files are responsible for, and what functions you can edit. This can be used across all OS - I just include it here.</p>
<blockquote>[i] Files 
<p>Banned-ips - contains all banned ips</p>
<p>banned-players - contains all banned playerNames</p>
<p>ops - contains the name of all servers OPS</p>
<p>Server - a log of everything printed out on the GUI</p>
<p>white-list - a list of names which are allowed to play your server if the whitelist function is enabled in properties.<br>
[/i]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I’ve left out properties because I want to go into more detail on it. Properties has a ton of stuff you can edit such as save name etc</p>
<blockquote>#Minecraft server properties
#Sat Apr 16 21:23:33 BST 2011
level-name=world // save name
hellworld=false
spawn-monsters=true // spawn mobs?
online-mode=true // if this is true hacked clients won't be able to connect
spawn-animals=true // spawn things like pigs etc
max-players=20 // maximum players on your server at one time
server-ip= // ip of server
pvp=true // is playervsplayer on?
level-seed= // seed i.e Tom_BETA
server-port=25565 // server port number IP:PORTNUMBER
white-list=false // does it use the whitelist function stated above?</blockquote>
<p>That’s a brief overview of the properties file. Now that you’ve ran the EXE the server is listening for connections on the specific port in the properties file, so remember to change that! If you need to portforward then simply use the following site.</p>
<p><a href="http://portforward.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://portforward.com/</a></p>
<p>It will cover everything in regards to portforwarding your router.</p>
