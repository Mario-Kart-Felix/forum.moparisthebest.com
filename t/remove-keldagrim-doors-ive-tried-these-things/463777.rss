    <title>Remove keldagrim doors? I&#39;ve tried these things</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/remove-keldagrim-doors-ive-tried-these-things/463777</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I just started working on a new source, I want a good old Keldagrim base (; For me and my buddies to play around on. Majority of the doors are closed, and for the life of me I can&#39;t get them to delete. I&#39;ve tried doors.cfg, objectToRemove, deleteThatObject, none of these are working. Any ideas on what I should do, and in what file?</description>
