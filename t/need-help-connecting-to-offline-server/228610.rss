              <p>Retard you are wrong.</p>
<p>On the HOSTING computer go to cmd.exe and type “ipconfig” (without the " )</p>
<p>Then on there look for the IPv4 or similar address, it should be your Default gateway but with a different number at the end.</p>
<p>Then just type that IP into the client on a computer on your network.</p>

              <p>I probably don’t understand the question being asked, but i’ll give the answer to what I think you mean anyway.</p>
<p>When you run the server, you can access it ONLY FROM THE HOSTING COMPUTER at 127.0.0.1 but your brother or whoever is also accessing the server will need to access the server via it’s IP. This ip is probably a no-ip unless you have not set one.</p>
<p>If you don’t want other people coming on your server yet because you are testing it, just delete your no-ip and get a new one which only you and your brother know. Once you’re done, get your old no-ip back which people know and hopefully they will come back online.</p>
