              <p>ShopAssistant.java<br>
You should have a method called<br>
buyFromShopPrice</p>
<p>It should have stuff like:</p>
<p><code>
 else if (c.myShopId == 7390 &amp;&amp; c.myShopClient != null
				&amp;&amp; c.myShopClient.playerName.equals(c.playerName)) {
			c.sendMessage(c.getItems().getItemName(removeId)
					+ ": currently costs " + c.playerShopP[removeSlot]
					+ " points.");
			return;
		}</code></p>
<p>However, I do agree with IfearI.</p>

              <p>Have you tried searching in your project for the words “currently costs”?<br>
When they send the message you could use an if-statement to distinguish between coins and another type of currency.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">(A more OOP way to generalize would be to use a Currency enum/class and handle the currency instead of an if)</span></p>
