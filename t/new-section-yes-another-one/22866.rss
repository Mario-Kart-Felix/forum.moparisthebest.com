    <description>CHAT BOX!!!

Why:
It will allow people with small questions to get them answered a lot faster.
It will benefit the site&#39;s community, as it will let people lead smaller conversations a lot faster.
Threads will become a matter of mass discussion, rather that making a whole thread just to ask why Jagex takes for ever to run an apeal.

Adding a Chat Box is a WIN&lt;----&gt;WIN situation for the site.

Coments encouraged, but who I realy want to hear from is Mopar.</description>

              <p>Yes, from personal experiance, c-boxes are not good. I have a sight with 30 or so members and it was filled with swears and spam. Think of 40k members…ouch! You couln’t even read a message. Normally 200 people on? Maybe 50 are using CBox, thats 50 messages per minute (possibly :)) you would have a little more than a second to read the message!</p>
