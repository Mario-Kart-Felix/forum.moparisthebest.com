    <title>Troubles with Coordinates</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/troubles-with-coordinates/371767</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t figure out how to see my coordinates at all times.
I don&#39;t want a command that gives me my coordinates, I know how to do this.
What I need is to have it show my coordinates somewhere so I don&#39;t have to type in commands every 5 seconds. I know some clients or servers (not sure which it has to do with) have it listed where the weight of carried items should be. That&#39;s what I need.</description>
