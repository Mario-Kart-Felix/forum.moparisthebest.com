    <title>Athiest wears pasta strainer on head for drivers license photo</title>

    <description>Says its his religion hahaha

&lt;blockquote&gt;Niko Alm first applied for the licence three years ago after reading that headgear was allowed in official pictures only for confessional reasons.

Mr Alm said the sieve was a requirement of his religion, pastafarianism.

Later a police spokesman explained that the licence was issued because Mr Alm&#39;s face was fully visible in the photo.

&quot;The photo was not approved on religious grounds. The only criterion for photos in driving licence applications is that the whole face must be visible,&quot; said Manfred Reinthaler, a police spokesman in Vienna.

He was speaking on Wednesday, after Austrian media had first reported Mr Alm&#39;s reason for wearing the pasta strainer.

After receiving his application the Austrian authorities had required him to obtain a doctor&#39;s certificate that he was &quot;psychologically fit&quot; to drive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cant believe they checked to make sure he didnt have psychological problems.

A while ago, a Dutch guy was actually allowed to have a picture of him dressed as a clown as his ID photo. He had to get a new one after a few months though.<br>

the point is that people think its ridiculous to do these things, and dismiss the ridiculousness of religion itself</p>
<p>“George Bush says he speaks to god every day, and christians love him for it. If George Bush said he spoke to god through his hair dryer, they would think he was mad. I fail to see how the addition of a hair dryer makes it any more absurd.” – Sam Harris</p>
<p>The pasta strainer isn’t the part that makes it ridiculous.</p>
