    <title>Reading a Sticky</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reading-a-sticky/11891</link>
    <description>Now chances are if you are the one person in need of this tutorial you porbably won&#39;t be the one reading it, but I might as well make it anyhow.

Everyone has seen them but it seems like no one reads them. Stickys that is, now you&#39;re probably thinking &quot;WTF is a Sticky?&quot; and today I will answer that and show you how simple it is to access the useful information inside of a sticky.

First off I will show you what a sticky is and what its characteristics are, This is a Sticky:

Sometimes however there are more than one sticky, in this case there is only one.

There are three characteristics you should know that will help you figure out which posts are stickys.

A. As you see in the picture above it is slightly darker then the rest of the posts.

B. There will be a Thumbtack looking icon:

or

C. It will be at the top of the section it is posted in. 

Now there are two remaining steps:

1. Click the Sticky(s).

2. Read the Sticky(s)

Now you have the knowledge required to read a sticky, and therefore no excuse not to read them. If you do not read the sticky then expect to get flamed :)</description>
