    <description>This is a [b]Serious[/b] question that I have, and am very much hoping that I can get it resolved atleast by tonight or tomarrow.

I have some clients for a 508 server, and I also have the 508 caches, and about 3 different 508 servers, all of them are working fully functionally on a computer I tested them on. However, when I try them on [b]My[/b] actually computer, I also recieve the error: [b]&#39;error_game_js5connect&#39;[/b]. I [b]Do Not[/b] have No-IP, and I do not have Internet on my computer. What I use to connect is: [b]&#39;127.0.0.1&#39;[/b].

I wanted to know If I have to Portforward to resolve the problem, even though my computer doesn&#39;t have internet. The clients only recieve these errors when i&#39;m using them on my one computer.

Please help, I would very [b]VERY[/b] much appreciate it. And if you are able to help, PM, and i&#39;ll give you an [B]AWSOME!!![/B] 508 Source-Base for your server in-return; if that&#39;s allowed, if not then Nvm..
