          <blockquote>
              <p>your network is not 127.0.0.1 thats the localhost which can only be used by you. If other people type that in they will connect to there local host.<br>
First off you make the Ham network. I can be any name and any pass you choose<br>
you then tell people the Hamachi network and password then they will connect to your network. You should see near the top of the hamachi window and IP thats starts with 5 and looks something like 5.000.000.00 this is what the people will connect to one they are in the Hamachi network! they must connect to your network first before typing that 5.000â€¦ ip in</p>
<p>now for the scound question</p>
<p>Runserver.bat or Startserver.bat simply starts your server and can be located in your source folder</p>
<p>hope this helps you</p>
