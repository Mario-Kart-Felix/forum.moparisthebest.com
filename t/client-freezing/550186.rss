    <description>Hey So I wanted to get into 718&#39;s and learn a bit more of java and how rsps work however I am having an issue on my main pc. Any client I run freezes in about 30 seconds after the login screen pops up. No errors are in the cmd and If I wait long enough It works again for another 30 seconds. I have tried both java 7 and Java 8 and the server Is hosted on my Dedicated Box. If I move the Client over to my laptop Everything works perfectly fine. Any Idea what may be causing this? It is really starting to aggrivate me and wasting hours. Please and thank you!</description>
