    <description>Hello,

So, I had my server on the status 1st page with 1.7k votes, it was showing up as online all the time until today.
The uptime went down to 96% and it showed up as offline, but the server actually is online.
So I investigated the IP&#39;s/ports and all that stuff, it&#39;s online. R-L shows that it&#39;s online too.

This is the link to it : http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?server=vyrescapepk.no-ip.biz

What should I do?

P.S Sorry for double posting.

EDIT: Can I somehow change the status pages IP adress?</description>
