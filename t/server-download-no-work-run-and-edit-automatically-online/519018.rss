Do you like Action bars dominating gameplay? no, I miss being able to talk during bossing/training etc…<br>
Do you like the concept of a built bonus(almost like a special attack) that you can use? the adrenaline? it’s alright, if it was built up depending on how much dmg you did on your target that’d be a pretty cool alternative.</p>

<p>i think you got the wrong end of the stick my friend. when i said surely, i didn’t mean it as a ‘so obvious’ way, i meant it as a rhetorical question.</p>
