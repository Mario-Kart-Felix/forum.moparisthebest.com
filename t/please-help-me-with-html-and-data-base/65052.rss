    <title>Please help me with html and data base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-help-me-with-html-and-data-base/65052</link>
    <description>I would love to have a Player Count on my website, listing how many people are online saying, “there are +online+ people online.” as a link so when clicked takes you to a page showing all the people that are online and offline.

Like a high score showing the higher leveled player at the top, so when you click the name, it takes you to a page showing all that players levels. 

Plus how many people they have killed and how many times they have died. (As like on pimpscape) 

Just the info that is show in quest dialogs, on a private server show on my website.

If some one could help me with this I would be more then grateful.

But I think if the server is offline it would not be able to show that info so I would need it to save the last (date) it got to the html page in till it can reconnect to the server to update.</description>
