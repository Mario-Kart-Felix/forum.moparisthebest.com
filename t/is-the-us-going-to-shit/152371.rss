    <title>Is the US going to shit?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-the-us-going-to-shit/152371</link>
    <description>Just reading through reddit, I&#39;m getting the feeling that the US is breaking down into a police state / dictatorship.  I&#39;ll include a list of articles that just seem to show the US is getting really fucked up.

[url=http://alternet.org/rights/65406/]When crack cocaine possession means 24 years in prison and manslaughter means only 3, you know something is seriously wrong with the U.S. criminal justice system.[/url]

[url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/17/washington/17cnd-prexy.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin]Bush threatens &quot;World War III&quot; if Iran pursues a nuclear weapon. He has officially lost his damn mind.[/url]

[url=http://www.pollsb.com/polls/poll/2984/bush-appoints-anti-contraception-activist-susan-orr-to-head-us-birth-control-program]Bush appoints anti-contraception activist, Susan Orr, to head US birth control program[/url]

[url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2007/10/15/fingerprint-doubt-over-kelly-suicide-89520-19952329/]Police Now Suspect Murder in Apparent Suicide of Scientist Who Blew Whistle on Iraq Intelligence Fabrications[/url]

These are only the headlines right now.  Blackwater, internal corruption, police brutality, faggoty moves by Bush... all that is commonplace in the US nowadays.

EDIT:

[url=http://www.slate.com/id/2176185/]George Bush&#39;s Stab at Dictatorship[/url]</description>

<p>Of course, because I was making the point of Bush being Hitler reincarnated.  Oh wait… I WASN’T.</p>
<p>Well come to think of it…  Let’s see…  Bush passed a bill allowing him to be president indefinitely.  What’s next, he’s going to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">burn the Capitol</a>?</p>

exactly, we are down trillions of dollars, and $42 billion a year to keep a non addictive drug that is not as bad as tobacco (which is highly addictive with hundreds of chemicals in it) illegal, when its pretty much organic, is quite ridiculous… The only reason that it is illegal, is because they think it is a gateway drug. who cares, most people who do marijuana never go beyond that.<br>

<p>You don’t have to argue that point, I agree marijuana isn’t harmful.  Though it being organic is simply a stupid reason to state it’s not harmful.  Benzene is organic.  Try smoking some of that.  Poison arrow frogs secrete organic poisons.  Try smoking that.[/quote]</p>
<p>thats not what i meant, for a smoking product, its completely organic, unlike most others.</p>

Yes we make enemies by the day. However, we actually are keeping the war off our soil by fighting it over there, because we are fighting it over there. simple as that. and i doubt that it would be easy to the terrorists to aquire the means to succesfully bomb us with enough power (im talking from actual bombs, not fucking planes) to make a difference. It would be noticable if there were a large amount of muslims coming into the country, thus “requiring” the US to take action, and detain and search them. We are giving them the reason to bomb us, but they dont because they cant. not because of lack of materials, but because they cant do it without getting noticed.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>We’re losing more people to the war than to 9-11.  What are you saying?  Iraq never attacked us.  Saddam didn’t do anything to us.  Stop believing what the media is telling you, and open your eyes for once.  They can barely pay to ship a grenade over to the US, not to mention sending a WMD over here.[/quote]</p>
<p>i dont listen to the media. i personally havent watched the news/looked at anything news related in months. i hate them. I think it is the ideals that Bush found offensive (hating western civilization for example) and then the 9-11 set him off. but yes, i know. everything we do sends us into deeper debt.</p>

thats what i mean. they take in money for personal benefit, not in the best interest of the people, which is what this governement was built upon, benefiting the people, not those who make decisions. i guess i said it wrong, they are not going in the best interest of the citizens.<br>

<p>No, the government was built upon human faults and weaknesses.  Checks and balances were put in place which were utterly destroyed by the Bush administration.  If there’s one person at fault, it’s Bush.[/quote]</p>
<p>I have to agree with you there. it was built knowing the fact that if there werent checks and balances, give it 10 years and it would turn into a dictatorship. but Bush has screwed it all up.</p>

<p>i believe the US is going down the shitter. Bush is mentally retarded (like literally) and nobody is helping. We spend $42 Billion to keep marijuana illegal every year, and have been doing that for years on end. Thats just against one drug. Then the war, im all for staying in because i dont want war on our soil, but it was a pretty dumb move to start the war. The administration is completely dumb. a family of hics could have run the country better.</p>

<p>We’re down a couple trillion.  I think we have $42 billion to spend, even though if its for a stupid reason.  Every day we spend in Iraq, the more enemies we make.  We’re not keeping war off our soil, stop listening to all that shit being shoved into your mouth.  We’re giving terrorists all the more reason to bomb us.<br>

<p>exactly, we are down trillions of dollars, and $42 billion a year to keep a non addictive drug that is not as bad as tobacco (which is highly addictive with hundreds of chemicals in it) illegal, when its pretty much organic, is quite ridiculous… The only reason that it is illegal, is because they think it is a gateway drug. who cares, most people who do marijuana never go beyond that.<br>
Yes we make enemies by the day. However, we actually are keeping the war off our soil by fighting it over there, because we are fighting it over there. simple as that. and i doubt that it would be easy to the terrorists to aquire the means to succesfully bomb us with enough power (im talking from actual bombs, not fucking planes) to make a difference. It would be noticable if there were a large amount of muslims coming into the country, thus “requiring” the US to take action, and detain and search them. We are giving them the reason to bomb us, but they dont because they cant. not because of lack of materials, but because they cant do it without getting noticed.</p>

<p>thats what i mean. they take in money for personal benefit, not in the best interest of the people, which is what this governement was built upon, benefiting the people, not those who make decisions. i guess i said it wrong, they are not going in the best interest of the citizens.</p>

<p>I plan on moving out of the US after i am out of med school. i will go to like Italy or something. But the US isnt that appealing to me anymore. too many damn arguments out of stupid things that should be a persons choice (i.e. abortion, marijuana, drinking, smoking, all that). The only real reason they keep most of that stuff illegal is because of different parties decisions, whatever the Congress is dominated by (democrat or republican), that will decide what happens. I was taught that this government was “by the people, for the people” its not. we elect, they fuck us over.</p>
<p>Politicians are absolutly nothing like normal citizens, and from my experiences, dont care that much about what we think. Democracy in the US is corrupt in a different way. Like i said earlier, whichever party has the majority in the Congress, dominates what happens in the US, period. So in order to make a better country, reforms must be made. New things need to happen. We are 231 years old and made our way to the top, but what comes up must go down, we went up, we are now coming down.</p>
<p>Everything is in shambles, and i feel lucky to not be directly connected to the war or anything else. The only real problems i have are with unlawful actions (marijuana and such)</p>

<p>That was quite possibly one of the most idiotic things i have seen on these forums, yes including moparscape.</p>
<p>The biggest terrorist groups are not the Muslims, britian and the united states government are under attack almost Everyday by Russian terrorists, but through the internet and such, all the governments information and all that crap.</p>
<p>Basically, if you are classing Muslims as terrorists because they come into our country’s and blow things up then that makes the us terrorists as well since we are going into their country and blowing things up.<br>
Don’t you see? we are at war with the ‘Muslim extremists’ and since they don’t have one huge army like us and all don’t have the equipment, money and size that we have then thats the only way they can attack us back.</p>
<p>We are in their country, trying to take over their lives what do you expect them to do? just sit back and let us?<br>
Even if we got rid of the muslim extremists, another terrorist group would come along, like the IRA (an irish terrorist group) they had been attacking england, car bombs, everything for years.</p>
<p>There are plenty more and bigger terrorist groups than the Muslim extremists, but the Muslim’s are the center of attention at the moment, and have been the causes of the most recent big attacks.<br>
Killing off all the muslims would be pointless, stupid, and plain wrong since 99.9%(random percentage but that is probably right) are not terrorists.</p>
<p>Imagine if a FEW Americans, or Christians, Chinese or British people decided to form a terrorists group and they went around blowing places up for whatever reason and then the rest of the world labeled YOU as a terrorist because you was the same religion as the terrorists and was saying things like you people are saying about the muslims, “lets kill the kill ALL the Americans, because a few of them are causing us problems”.</p>
<p>Think about what you say, because its so fucking annoying to see you faggots saying idiotic crap like that, if you have nothing sensible to say then keep it shut.</p>

              <p>This is why I love being Canadian. We aren’t the center of universe (USA), we don’t have a massive military (USA), and we don’t decide to invade a country for an unclear reason (USA). When Prime Minister Jean Chretien said Canada would not take part in the invasion of Iraq, I was rather proud that he had the courage to stick it to Bush.<br>
I do somewhat agree that Muslims are causing most of the problem, however, this is ~1% of the entire Muslim population. It’s the Muslim Extremists at fault.</p>

<p>Im finaly going to Iraq next month, so I wont be around.[/quote]</p>
<p>Those figures are only of troops that die on the ground. If a soldier is shot and dies in a rescue helicopter or whatever, he isnt counted. According to the American veterans association 73,000 US soldiers have died in bothe gulf wars. The figures are alot more than what is told. I dont blame american media for hiding this. Please google this figure and the American veterans association if you need proof.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Yes, fuck compulsory service. What a great way to waste your time. </span>I visited Iraq two years ago, the people living there slept 2/3 of the day because of the burning heat of 50*C. I’m truly thankful for coming to Finland when I was 2,5yrs old, now I don’t have to go through the pain and suffering they are in atm. Sorry for being such cold-hearted, don’t judge when you have never been there.</p>

<p>You don’t have to agree with the system, but breaking the law is not the best way to show your gratefulness, really.</p>
