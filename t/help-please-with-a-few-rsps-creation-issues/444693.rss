    <title>Help please with a few rsps creation issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-please-with-a-few-rsps-creation-issues/444693</link>
    <description>First off. I am completely lost now days with rsps. I am 16 so not the best at this lol. I don&#39;t understand the whole cache system. See I place the cache I download into my dropbox and link it to whatever client I am using usually it is a client/source/cache package from website forums such as mopar/locus I follow directions and it just never loads the cache it freezes or just get an error. Also I am having trouble getting my servers online even if I manually extract my cache into my C drive I still cannot access the runescape server even from the initiall 127.0.0.1 which if I remember right should work at least for your own IP adress? All help is appriciated I know most people say if I cant figure some of this out not to do it at all but I enjoy this alot and we all have to start somewhere right? Any help please message me I can do Skype or team viewer as soon as I get the message. Even E-mailing is ok. I dont really have alot to offer anyone money wise but if you find yourself willing to help me start a 662 or any servers like that please let me know! ESPECIALLY on the whole cache system! I hope this was in the right section I am pretty sure it was! THANKS GUYS :)</description>

              <p>It’s not always true that the cache needs to be in the C: drive to work. My cache atm only works if it is in the client folder. And before you host, i suggest you get to know how to maintain and develope a server.</p>
