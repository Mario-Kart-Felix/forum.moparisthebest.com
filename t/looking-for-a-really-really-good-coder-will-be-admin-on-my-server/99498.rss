    <title>LOOKING FOR A REALLY REALLY GOOD CODER! WILL be admin on my server</title>

    <description>[b]DONT BOTHER EVEN POSTING[/b] [u]IF YOU DONT KNOW YOUR STUFF[/u].  [b]YOU WONT BE ADMIN IF YOU CANT FLUENTLY UNDERSTAND CODING.  ONLY APPLY IF YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO- AND THEN I WILL BE MORE THEN HAPPY TO MAKE YOU ADMIN.  THANKYOU[/b]

I&#39;ve already made some mods for finding glitches.  Now i&#39;m looking to make an admin for coding some stuff.  I&#39;m new and am a beginner.  if you be a coder you&#39;ll be an admin on my server for doing a good job and accomplishing something.  I dont want you to DO everything for me, but we&#39;ll team up :P

reasons you want to be admin on my server... LAG FREE! as far as i know.  All feedback so far has said they&#39;ve had no lag- also feeback is saying THEY LOVE MY SERVER so far, although theres a million things that could make it better.  I feel it has much potential.  Heres what i have planned....

1)  ::rules command and u cant move until you read them
2)  ::commands command
3)  ::cwars tele command
4)  ::pocketportal command wont work for some reason (its a guide that adds 5 more tele&#39;s then normal.
5)  agility added but ::gnomecourse ::barbariancourse ect wont work although they&#39;re added.  no error either
6)  I wana add a minigame where you kill a dragon with like 1000 hp and it drops key you then go use on a chest located somewhere near mage bank in wildy and recieve 200 mill reward and a p hat.  You must beat a hard foe...then risk dieing to recieve your reward..
7)  I wana add chompy bird hunting possibly but good rewards instead of hats...
8)  I wana have it where ::noclip and ::cat and ::pickup and ::getitem and ::setobject and ::setnpc will all kick you from server.  
9)  I want to add castlewars.  I think it might be already... if only i could GO TO CASTLE WARS and find out lol no tele command.
10)I want it so you can only summon 3 npc&#39;s
11)I want many shops changed and bonuses differed.

Dont worry you wont do all this i&#39;ll be helping (and doing most myself) these are just future updates...

Use the following form for an application....

[b]Are you currently coding any other servers?
How much time do you spend a day on computer?
How much experiance do you have with coding and java? 
Can you please post a few tuts or links that can assure me that your good with coding?
Are you able to do almost all of the above future updates I want?
Are you reliable/nice/respectful/intellegent[/b]

its hamachi atm...but dont turn away because of it.  I&#39;m going to buy a router soon[br][size=1]Posted on: May 23, 2007, 06:31:13 PM[/size][hr]Nobody wants to take up my offer?</description>

<p>okay i wont be a jerk but just go to <a href="http://no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">http://no-ip.org</a> put your IP and you don’t have to use hamachi if your IP changes just go to <a href="http://no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.org</a> (if you have cookies enabled on your browser) it will automaticlly login and update your ip so you don’t have to do anything…</p>
