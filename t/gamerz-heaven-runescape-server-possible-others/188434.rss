[center]Is Looking for a runescape server! We need everyspot filled for it. Coder, Host, Admin, Mod, and of course regular members. GH(Gamerz Heaven) is a forum all about gaming and since runescape it self is such a big community i thought why not have a Private Server for it. So ill be needing alot of people to fill these jobs. Most important of course are the first two. So without those this server will not go on. The host needs to be 20/7 ATLEAST! If not better i might pay for a dedicated oe though ill update if i am. The Link to the forum is www.ghforum.net if intrested please post here or on the forums in the runescape section or contact me via msn ownedggre@hotmail.com[/center]
