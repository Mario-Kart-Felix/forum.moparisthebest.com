    <title>How to make minigame in one class? [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-minigame-in-one-class-317/477896</link>
    <description>I coded 718 a bit (very bit) and in it everything could be handled in one class. That makes it a lot easier since you don&#39;t have to check 5 files for every object and interface button and so on. So how easy it would be to do same in 317 servers?

Also I am wondering this very nooby question: If I have lets say class CastleWars and it has public void startgame() how can I execute that void in commands class?
EDIT: And what would be command to check if there is objects nearby?</description>

              <p>Java is java man. Of course you can re-handle minigames. My advice would be to use inheiritance and do some sort of global processing for all minigames.</p>
