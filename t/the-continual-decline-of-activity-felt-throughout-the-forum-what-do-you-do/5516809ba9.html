I’m not fluent in php at all, but I’ll look at SMF’s code and maybe hop on their forums, see what I can find out and do.</p>

You’re forgetting that for every legit reason to give people more to work with there are ten reasons not to. 250 character increase to help people with their long bbc code quotes may seem well and good, but you’re also going to get people that have 10 characters of bbc code to set the font size to the largest one allowed in signatures and then 490 characters of that huge font.

[/quote]Just limit the font size allowed for signatures? Literally just one line of code I’m sure. Don’t make BBCode not count towards the signature length. Just increase the length, limit the lines, and limit the font size. Problem solved.[/quote]It already is limited, hence why I said “the largest one allowed in signatures”. But even with that limit it’s large enough that 500 characters is obnoxious. I think you’d struggle to find any font size where 500 characters wouldnt be annoying, to be honest. Unless you just limit people to the normal font. But then the customization of signatures is kinda pointless.</p>

        <p>This place is just another RS server dump full of tools/bases/clients/documentation for people to use.</p>
<p>In order to keep the community around til 2020 we are going to need a common goal or interest. You can’t do that with a private server (for the community to play) because we are interested in deving one, not playing it. Old School Runescape removes the need for old school servers. RSC still has active players but just a loss of organization and unionization on that part.</p>
<p>Minecraft server (the original one we had) was awesome…</p>
<p>I think we just need to offer a “1 button” server for all generation. RSC, 317, 508+. EasyRSC/Moparclassic sorta deal. We as moparscape, should always offer a “base” for people who are interested.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Frell, post:30, topic:551680”]Jagex is destroying oldschool and there are many oldschool fans who would prefer a 508 era game, the best hope for the forum is for the official server to make further progress</p>
<p>Start there. Anything server related won’t make it. For servers to be popular runescape has to be popular, which is hardly is nowadays.[/quote]</p>
<p>I think this is a good point.</p>
<p>I came to the RS Cheating side in late 2003, so I’ve literally seen it all. I’ve seen the rise of sites, as well as the decline. Think of the direction that websites have gone in the early RSPS Days</p>
<p>Richard / Cheetah --&gt; Sythe --&gt; Black market<br>
Juan --&gt; Fagex --&gt; Combination black market/ exploits / cheating<br>
Mopar–&gt; MITB --&gt; RSPS / Cheating<br>
Kaits --&gt; Cheating</p>
<p>Each one had their own niche market. Obviously MITB and Sythe are all that remain, but I really do feel that when people think of RSPS, they don’t think of RS–LOCUS OR R - S. Mopar has always been the go-to website.</p>
<p>Now I haven’t played RS in an actual capacity since 07 came out(and that turned into playing for $) and before that it had to be around 2007. But I have stayed active within the community in regards to updates and the current state of the game. From what I see now , PVP is not fairing so well. Now I’m not saying to make this the emphasis of the game, but promotion wise this is big. Tie this in with some SEO and advertising and we should see some growth.</p>
<p>We do need an overhaul though. SMF and its simplicity worked years ago, but I think we need to redefine ourselves. Logo competitions with prizes, a community voted theme, new motto, etc. This should coincide with the launch of the server(maybe launching other games as well such as the personal projects mentioned and Minecraft). I’ve always been against a chatterbox, but if we could get IRC on the main page that would be pretty cool(to <span class="hashtag">#Moparscape</span>).</p>

<p>This has been suggested many times before, if someone could create a plugin or I am sure we could use one like kiwi or another web based irc client it could work out great. I always thought it would be cool to talk to the people on the forum from irc.</p>

<p>[hr]</p>
<p>I will reiterate mostly what casey said. We need a massive rebranding which should include the: forums, IRC, official server and the wiki.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Wiki</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]Update the software and theme used.[/li]<br>
[li]Add more moderators, to combat spam and the spread of false information.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">IRC</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]A live support idea has been suggested previously, although I would prefer for people to stick to the help section I guess it is tolerable[/li]<br>
[li]We need to rebrand the chat as somewhere moderately active, but for this the site must be active itself[/li]<br>
[li]No trolls in the <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> channel[/li]<br>
[li]A help bot?[/li]<br>
[li]As per rebranding - make it known that we have new operators etc (hit me up for deets before you publish this) - preferably coincide all the rebranding together[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Server</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]Reduce our standards a bit, I think people are afraid of committing content because they think their code is shit (etc)[/li]<br>
[li]sini hit me up dog[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Forum</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]Update the software and change the default theme it’s not 1993 anymore[/li]<br>
[li]Add a market place for RS goods I guess? As casey said we need to expand so that people can come to mopar knowing it’s where they will find <span class="bbcode-b">everything</span> they want[/li]<br>
[li]Find a way to github integrate into the forums, would be pretty neat since most people use it nowadays[/li]<br>
[li]Remove this stupid censor bullshit[/li]<br>
[li]Remove anti-leech bullshit releases[/li]<br>
[li]Remove section mods that are no longer modding…[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Forums - Content</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]More ELI5 content for newcomers, i.e. if you are new and just register suggest some content like: how to join our chat room, how to host a server for mac in 5 minutes, rsps protocol resources, how to look for help, etc[/li]<br>
[li]Epic threads to forums pls[/li]<br>
[li]General computing threads - i.e. good apps to use on windows, etc (clickbait titles m8) - as per expansion of domain[/li]<br>
[li]Cheating in more than just one game - sini had suggested league, any game would really work (even shitty cheatengine tutorials)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Forums - Rewards</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]If we keep discussing how to do this, it isn’t going to happen so just do something already[/li]<br>
[li]Reward system - create a panel of peer-elected members who can review a few people’s contributions/time period (as per polls) and determine awards to give/retract[/li]<br>
[li]Give a monthly reward to people who have posts with useful stuff/lots of views (info, downloads, etc) - as per above committee[/li]<br>
[li]Thread rating system as per committee/mods (which will hopefully bump up useful stuff, ie if sorted by ‘rating’)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Community</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]A community twitch team would be nice[/li]<br>
[li]Community youtube[/li]<br>
[li]General gaming content highlights[/li]<br>
[li]Use the twitch channel more - someone should manage this, maybe like 24hr gaming marathons every weekend (where a bunch of people will play some games for a bit, some speedrunning etc)[/li]<br>
[li]More github activity, perhaps make an organisation one (i totally dont have ‘MoparScape’ already to go with this)[/li][/ul]</p>

<p>I like all these ideas.</p>
<p>The wiki we had 5 or so moderators that turned into just me moderating it. It has been suggested before that we restructure the wiki to make it easier for people to find information and also to add markdown support. If we find a good alternative I am sure MITB and Tom can figure something out.</p>
<p>As for IRC again we’ve had suggestions before to add either a chat box or a plugin for an irc box that people can use. I would rather see one with irc since it would still be here for the older members to use and who knows maybe we can get more people interested in it also? I know a lot of people tend to stay away from <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> because they have this fear of being attacked, this isn’t true. Sure we all tell these horrible stories of people quitting the site because tL and c`p told them to “stfu”. But really as long as you don’t ask for server help literally everyone in that channel is nice and are great to talk with.</p>
<p>For the forum part I agree with all the suggestions, we really do need to branch out. Another suggestion I have is does SMF or if we ever change software support creating a separate archive? I bring this up because I think it would be an even cooler idea to have a sub domain of the site dedicated to an archive of boards and topics. I know smf has the archive button all the way at the bottom. But the problem with that is it’s so hard to look at the website when you have all those boards opened up. This way we can keep old archived topics in another section of the website that can be accessed more easily.</p>
