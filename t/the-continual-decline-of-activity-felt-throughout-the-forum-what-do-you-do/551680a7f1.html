<p>When I first joined the rsps scene I came straight to Mopar and didn’t even consider leaving. I was banned (over a misunderstanding) and it took me almost 2 years to get unbanned.

<p>Granted, this is sort of the birthplace of our entire community, and a lot of members here have contributed to the development of the scene in major ways but just look back at the last five years of development within the community as a whole. Almost none of it has come from Mopar. As Sin said in one of the first pages R-S is a lot more user friendly (granted, it has the elitists but not to the level that they have here). There is a lot more forum and user interaction over there.</p>
<p>I feel that this forum has become a site for old members to sand over the new ones and tell them what they did, and who they are when the new members honestly just want to try and make a game/be a part of our community.</p>
<p>It’s sad because I remember this site being so welcoming when I first joined and I just feel that we have veered of course.</p>
<p>In regards to what can be done to push forum activity up there have been numerous ideas that would work great. Mincraft, an Official server (yeah lol.).</p>

I looked at them a couple months ago for the nostalgia. And that world ended because it was back before plugins were popular and we had offline mode enabled (so anyone can log in as anyone) and someone logged in as me with a cracked client and spawn shitloads of TNT to blow up everything. Good times.[/quote]Ah, fuck.  What I would do to play on that map again.</p>

        <p>The open source, low cost, and conservative ideals that strangle any potential are responsible for the death of good ideas in this community. As far as Minecraft is concerned, there should’ve been real investment years ago to take us away from external dependency on plugin systems like bukkit. I tried to push the idea of developing our own or adapting the bukkit system so we can become self sufficient long before it went south, it wasn’t to be, and now we have a situation where the bukkit dependent server had to close. If we look at bukkit now, they’ve been a year or so behind on releasing updates and their latest version has even been DMCA’d. If we were at all serious about having Minecraft as an integral part of the community then serious decisions must accompany it, in my opinion it’s too late for Minecraft now, but it’s an important note in any case.</p>
<p>The community has a tendency to argue about insignificant details while ignoring the real game ender further down the track. A lot of people here are effectively the cattle arguing about the weather while being transported to the slaughter house. If you want to “fix” the community, then either do something to contribute and make the small difference or come to the realisation that new idea backed by new approaches and money need to be thought up.</p>

The second part is more accurate, it’s exactly what I’ve been saying since the start of this thread. People in this community who want it to be “saved” and “revived” need to do work themselves. This community - for the most part - are trolls who like to have a laugh at others expenses (which is a-ok with me). That doesn’t make a welcoming, friendly community where we want to strive for success. If this community was to be brought back to it’s hay-day, it’s gonna take a big attitude change in most of the posters - myself included.</p>

i feel similar about it, id also like it to be saved or revived, but i dont do anything to help out or give any ideas, yet at the same time i dont just shoot down every single idea or suggestion thats given, if youre going to just look at every single possible negative aspect of some sort of suggested change or new feature then you should be also giving some ideas and helping out too, because thats what it feels like, any idea given is instantly shot down and none of those people try to contribute in any way possible. Sure, go ahead and be in support of some sort of leap of faith addition to save the website that someone else thought up, but if all a person does is shoot down ideas then come up with your own at least, its like they purposely do it to guarantee the the death of this place and that feels really popular here, I really dont understand why this kind of attitude is so common here (Seen it on a bunch of other web sites too yes, but it feels like the prominent attitude for change here), every single piece of possible change is viewed as something that would bring negative things to the site/bring doomsday closer and any possible positive outcome is ignored.</p>
