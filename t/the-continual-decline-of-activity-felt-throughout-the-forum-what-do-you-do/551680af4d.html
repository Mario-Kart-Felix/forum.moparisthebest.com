        <p>Taharok has said it in a nutshell. Very to the point. The runescape private server area is fading away horribly, like everything in life it has served its time in its phase and will now slowly disappear. The only answer is to shift to another point of interest that is currently in phase or just let everything fade away.</p>
<p>This place has never been like it used to be when I first joined and it never will. It is so easy to find things more interesting in my life these days. At this point in time anybody can come along and create a private server, sure. Its all available and some even documented that anybody with <span class="bbcode-b">enough</span> programming knowledge could pick it up and run with it. The thing is, lets be true to ourselves. If you go and spend the next 6 months dedicated to creating a server. Unless you come out with a new minigame/skill almost every week, you will fade away in 3-4 months just like every other one.</p>
<p>A good example is the Eudemons Online private server community, these days you can find alot of readily available information, but there’s not enough of a playerbase looking to play a private server. They would rather spend money on the real thing. As I know Tom has mentioned many times, work is not free, very few will waste 100-200 hours of work for free on something that they even know will fade away.</p>
<p>The way society works is you either evolve with us, or fade away without us. Nothing is forever. I loved this place and always will. I worked at a prison for 2 years, now I work in construction as of a month ago. I had to evolve my life to better suit supporting a family. I am married, and working for the prison I was not making enough money, therefore I had to “evolve” into a new job.</p>
<p>Moparscape is not making enough traffic, its time to evolve.</p>
<p>Have a good day everyone. Miss the good ol’ days but those are gone with the times.</p>

        <p>That’s a perfectly valid opinion to hold, after all this topic is about higher level management decisions. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I suppose what I’m getting it is: How do we evolve?

        <p>There are enough minecraft servers out these days. Best idea I can come up with is unless we have something completely unique, aka someone hack and create a private server for something, it won’t last long.</p>
<p>I have been looking into creating a server for Unturned. I just am having issues because of my Internet. There are no actual 3rd party servers for it but also none of the protocol is released so some data sniffing would be required.</p>
<p>But really there isn’t alot of options anymore. Most games are starting to come out with modability accounted for and a basic API to go with it.</p>
<p>Edit: No I am not saying that y’all should make a 3rd party server for Unturned. I am only saying that making a 3rd party server has worked. Look at bukkit, there was a default and a ModLoader for it, some people felt the need for a better one with built in modding support. There are some people here with enough knowledge to do this to make a basic base. Others could then build from it.</p>

<p>Given the main focus of this forum, I feel like modding would be an interesting topic to try to get people into. Anything with scripting, Garry’s Mod, Arma, etc. etc. Not saying we should say ‘lets make mods for these games’ but more-or-less create more discussion about modding/scripting in general. This forum did start off of cheating, why not open up to starting some conversations to ‘cheat’ in other games?</p>

Lol.</p>
<p>Given the main focus of this forum, I feel like modding would be an interesting topic to try to get people into. Anything with scripting, Garry’s Mod, Arma, etc. etc. Not saying we should say ‘lets make mods for these games’ but more-or-less create more discussion about modding/scripting in general. This forum did start off of cheating, why not open up to starting some conversations to ‘cheat’ in other games?[/quote]KF2 was all hype, if you look at the twitch section it has all died down now (avg viewers went from 20k+ to 50).</p>

        <p>Modding would be a great focus. There is another website I know of that is dedicated to modding anything do to with games, whether it’s private server, or mods for vanilla client/server. The biggest thing would be is shifting this from a rsps website over to a general modding “database” forum. Would require a lot of work from all staff and the community.</p>
<p>Also, how would you decide when a new section should be opened for a game. There’s alot of variables that would require heavy planning and great execution to shift this entire site. from what I have seen the staff has not had very good execution of many ideas. Y’all do a good job when it first happens but then it seems to just fall off and get forgotten like a rsps. Nobody really sticks with it.</p>

As I’ve said before, yes, people like you, me, Coon, and many more have used Git enough to be able to figure it out. However, Coony has a point, if we want the official server to be something everyone can get involved it, we need a thread or something somewhere that explains what we need done, and how to set it up on your system from a beginners perspective.</p>
<p>I face the same issue with the official server that I face with any private server project I’ve ever attempted. I struggle with creating tasks with myself, I’ve always done great when I had a list to work off of, nothing even a little like that is present for the official server.</p>

<p>As I’ve said before, yes, people like you, me, Coon, and many more have used Git enough to be able to figure it out. However, Coony has a point, if we want the official server to be something everyone can get involved it, we need a thread or something somewhere that explains what we need done, and how to set it up on your system from a beginners perspective.</p>
<p>I face the same issue with the official server that I face with any private server project I’ve ever attempted. I struggle with creating tasks with myself, I’ve always done great when I had a list to work off of, nothing even a little like that is present for the official server.</p>

<p>If I knew someone who was interested in developing one that was truly cross platform and not only suited for windows (the case senstitivity issue) then I would get back in. I have 3-4 hours usually every day I can spend doing so. But no, there’s not as many people playing them as their used to be either, only a fraction. When I created my first one back in '09 it was all star base and complete shit, but I still held a consistent 100-120 player base online at all times.</p>

        <p>runescape being &gt; 15 years old now may have something to do with it :). The bulk of players (2002-2006) are reaching their mid 20’s and beyond. hell, even some of the older original members are nearing retirement age. in either case, both age groups know they cannot bring back the nostalgia and quite honestly even attempting is unappealing. there’s intellectual copyright issues, time to re-write everything with limited to no pay off, and the usefulness of the task (you probably wouldn’t want to put ‘i wrote a runescape game emulator’ on your resume).</p>

        <p>considering practically everyone else and i haven’t loaded a runescape client in like 2-3 years that’s probably why this place is dying off. shift focus to modding other games or server emulators for other games.</p>
