    <description>Hey guys, I hope you&#39;re all well. :)

It&#39;s been a well established trend for many years that activity is in decline. It&#39;s publicly available information and if you&#39;ve missed Tree&#39;s biannual topics regarding it you can find forum activity data at the bottom of the forum. We&#39;ve really been around the roundabout with this one, I&#39;ve read every single topic in this board and the old one tonight and I&#39;ve come across members suggesting the forums &quot;death&quot; can be attributed to poor management, runescape&#39;s decline and a plethora of other reasons, some more bizarre than others. 

It&#39;s very hard to pinpoint a sole cause for every misfortune this community has had (Apart from the obvious reason of Classic) and while I do hold my own opinions regarding the reason activity has declined those opinions aren&#39;t what I want this topic to be about. Instead of looking for something in the past to type and talk about I&#39;d like the community to step into the shoes of the sole owner of this community and tell me about what they&#39;d do.

Maybe you&#39;d divert funds from the SSP into an advertising campaign? Or focus more on the SEO of the website? Perhaps you&#39;d even change the theme, or push harder for an official server? :) I genuinely want to see things through the frustrated eyes of those who post in this section, and instead of arguing about themes or reputation systems I&#39;d like to discuss meaningful advances on a higher level than forum modifications.</description>

I’ve been banned from r-s 4 times and each time I just had to send across $10 to a mod (who im not naming) to get unbanned.

At this point being a mod doesn’t even mean anything here, all we do is remove spambots and deal with the advertisement section, so none of us really care about it anymore and just contribute to discussions like everyone else. I’ve heard R-S mods will unban you for money tho, so that kinda <span class="bbcode-i">almost</span> makes me wish I was part of that shitfest.</p>
<p>Wow, I guess I just didn’t realize that enforcing SSL was the key to getting more members. :eek: Or was there some other update that I didn’t support? I guess there was the uhh Mopar Monthly blog or something that I predicted would fail and was a waste of time. I was right about it, but I guess you’re right that I was being pessimistic. Was there something else?</p>
<p>@ R-S being more mature -  :rolleyes:</p>

<p>That’s debatable, in regards to which community has the most mature members. It’s a shame, honestly - I hate to admit it, but when I was younger I looked up to quite a few members of this community, members of which who despised me for events I have yet to become aware of; one of said members includes you, sinisoul, along with David. I’m straying away from the point at hand: I would like to believe our community has the most mature members, but it’s rather difficult. Have you read the comments from the ‘highly respected’ members of this community lately? The majority of them completely belittle the newer members, and knock everything they have to say.</p>
<p>There are indeed a few promising games that are in development that started here on mscp, but those are the few who wanted to go above and beyond RSPS, which is quite rare, tbh. What are the chances that others will feel the same and actually do something about it? Let me answer that for you: the chances are slim to none.</p>

<p>I’m not saying it’s possible to regain popularity over-night, that’s virtually impossible. However, I have came across a ton of decent suggestions that would put us on the right path to redemption, but they’re always knocked by others for absolutely no reason at all. I’m aware that this forum was created for the ones who wished to cheat the RS scene, but isn’t it possible to slowly, but surely, stray away from the cheating scene and dedicate our forum to something else, something more appealing to the newer generation? If not, i’m sure there are still other ways to improve mopar, we just need to put our heads together and think outside of the box.</p>

<p>David and I have always had a falling out with one another, and I’m not exactly sure of the reason behind it. I suppose it was due to my stubbornness and retardation from when I was younger? I mean, that’s a highly likely possibility. I have nothing against him, regardless of what I say.</p>
<p>I don’t know - I know I’m not a vet or anything, but I did join this forum back in 2010 and would hate to see it die out completely, as i’m sure most of you would too, especially the one’s who joined back in 06-07, along with the ones who have made major contributions to not only the site, but the community as well.</p>

<p>Now the bot development scene, that is quite interesting. I think we do that much better, for history, but of course for modern practices you should visit rs-hacking or get in touch with some bot developers. A majority of them are quite nice! Very intelligent group of people. Even then the topics of bot development are also way beyond the scope that people normally can reach. It’s something a two to three year computer science student could get into, but not someone normally educated from high school. Graph theory, evolutionary algorithms, cryptography, data structures are all very dense subjects.</p>
<p>Your analogy is spot on. We are a, well, place people who want to just hang out and communicate with friends want to be. Not a MySpace more of a, well what we are now. An old forum. And that’s okay. The comparison is moot, and if you think they do it better go play with the kids. I mean that literally, I’m sure a majority of their userbase is under the age of 18. I think the average age here is 19-22, if not beyond that.</p>

<p>We aren’t ever going to regain popularity because you oldfags throw a bitch fit whenever someone suggests we update our shit “NO MOMMY I DONT WANT TO.
