I don’t think it was disregarded…<br>

<p>When it comes to people being rude to others, depending on the section, you can usually just report the post and a moderator will deal with it (I’m sure they’re tired of all my reports by now).

You are right, but look at it this way…<br>
If you went onto a site that was built in 1992, and liked it…<br>
Then came back to said site today to find out that literally nothing has changed, would you not consider the site to be “old” or “dead”? And would you want to be on it knowing that they have not changed a single thing in over 20 years?</p>
<p>I know I wouldn’t.<br>
While that’s not exactly the case here, a couple updates on the looks wouldn’t be a bad thing.</p>

<p>I understand. Flaming is not acceptable here and moderators will do their job accordingly. However, I feel as if people should receive infractions for insinuations of negativity.

I wasn’t getting defensive, I was just replying to your statement. But I get where you’re coming from.</p>
<p>You have to realize that most people won’t openly say “Okay I’ll work on being nicer” or whatever… Some will take it into consideration and some will ignore it totally.</p>
<p>I’m sure a couple of people are purposely rude/trolls on here (Can actually guaranty it); however I don’t think that it’s the majority of people.</p>

        <p>Yes, after I was proof-reading, I realized I used “you” and changed it to “they” before your reply. Excuse my choice of words! I understand you hadn’t gotten defensive about it, bud.</p>
<p>Yes, I can understand that somewhat. However, I’m coming from my perspective, as this is a suggestion topic. So, if one were to say that to me, that’s something similar I would say. Notwithstanding, I suppose I can see why people wouldn’t be open to changing their attitude, or accepting that they are in fact rude.</p>
<p>Yes, I’ve seen a few here myself haha</p>

        <p>Honestly?</p>
<p>A lot of successful websites launched with a different idea. And when they ran into trouble, they pivoted to something new.<br>
Like chat roulette, that was social media and then they pivoted to become a playground for the sexually monstrous.<br>
You just need a new idea, something people want. You can pivot too.</p>
<p>You’ve got a great name, you’ve got a great team, you’ve got a great logo, and you’ve got a great name. Just pivot.</p>

Don’t know if you’re joking about the Eve Online cheating, but you have to figure that a small percentage of active users actually play that game regularly. This pivot needs to be somewhat related. This forum is heavily based on works with the Java programming language, so personally I think something involving game or private server development would be best.</p>

        <p>I don’t play LoL, but I mean if someone produced a game server in Java or C# or something I’d probably mess with it anyways. We can make suggestions all day, but I mean really the only way to attempt that solution would be for someone to actually make a game server for something in a way that it could be forked off of and essentially create another trend.</p>

        <p>I don’t know why you guys are even bothering. This is a dying community, one way or another. The core members are on IRC, so there’s no real loss there. The forums though, will continue to decline.</p>
<p>Here’s what you have to ask yourself:</p>
<p>[ul][li]<span class="bbcode-u">What do we offer?</span> We were once the hub of development. This was the center of bot and private server development. None of the other communities had our grunt. No longer the case. When the private server communities branched out, we lost out. There’s not much talent there but there’s something more solid offered. Around the time MITB started, there were a few other big players with a slice of the pie. Sythe for example, was the hub of the black market. They’re still going strong. We also had Villavu which had their little slice of the pie due to their focus on SCAR (or whatever it’s called these days.). Then you had a whole bunch of communities that sat on the outskirts. Impsoft had bot software. Rsresources had a slice because it provided a more generalized place to hangout. Now the scene has been split up into hundreds of tiny communities. [/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-u">Are there even people to recruit?</span> I don’t think so. Runescape as a game seems to be declining. I think we’re experiencing private server fatigue as well, where people no longer care about it. That’s understandable though. I’ve never really seen the appeal in it.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-u">Do we know our audience?</span> No way. We don’t even know what we are. Are we a private server forum? Well, no. Other communities do it better and it’s that creepy cousin that we keep on our boards. Do we produce cheating applications? No. Aryan was how long ago? What about black market? Nope. Alright, so we don’t produce anything. But we are a general forum, right? It’s not cutting it. We have no identity. We don’t provide anything.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Listen, we were going to see a decline in the member base either way. The game is declining. Members didn’t want a board on software development. They wanted something they could easily download and use for free. We don’t have that anymore. It’s all good that we have a programming focus and all of that. It’s what I prefer this board having. However, most people can’t develop or will never try to. So what we provide just isn’t being bought.</p>
<p>Here’s the realistic solutions that would help:</p>
<p>[ol][li]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Affiliation</span></span>: Back when Sythe and Kaits were the two big players, there used to be a little link to Kaits at the bottom of the boards over on Sythe. This brought in a lot of traffic and a lot of the members it brought in were decent. They were used to being a member of a large community so it wasn’t too much of a stretch for them to integrate into ours. If we can secure some deals with some of the communities that now get majority of the traffic, I doubt we would lose anything. This includes places like Villavu, Sythe and RS. We’re not longer ‘too good’ for these places. We have been overshadowed.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">We change the focus:</span></span> We keep the Runescape private server section but start working on other popular games. WoW private servers bring in a lot of traffic. Really, anything that has more players than RS will be an increase in member base. These days, that’s not too hard. What about providing League of Legends ‘hacks’? It can be anything or everything. We need to stop being seen as that Runescape board though. Game dev? That seems to be pretty active.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">We focus on consumables:</span></span> People are too lazy to develop. We could do a month where we all try to generate as much content as possible. We could focus on youtube videos, game dev guides, cheats, private server tutorials and programming tutorials. We need something that people can get for free. [/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Ranks:</span></span> Internet points matter. Whether they are upvotes, facebook likes, instagram likes or even reputation. We want to feel as though we matter. Sythe used to have a pick-axe system where they would advance through copper to rune. We need something.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Forum theme:</span></span> We need alternatives. This is not the golden change that will bring in 99999 more users, but it will help to keep them. Just provide them as non-default.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Chat:</span></span> Make a chatbox at the top of the boards that just connects up with IRC. It’ll give the illusion of more activity and it will prevent people from avoiding IRC.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Become exclusive:</span></span> Another alternative is to embrace the change. We could make the forum invite only. Make it harder to get in and start focusing on decent content. People would be eager to join just because they’re not able to.[/ol]</p>
<p>The problem isn’t that there members aren’t really friendly. The problem isn’t that staff are sometimes heavy handed. It has always been that way and every community has that. We’re dying. We will never be what we were. All we can do is maintain our member base, transform to something else or replace our audience.</p>
<p>I’ve made countless threads over the past 5 years warning everyone about all of this. I told you that it was coming and you all laughed it off. Now we don’t have the memberbase to play with and you’re suddenly in a panic. You all got too comfortable and now we lose out because of it. Hell, I don’t even care anymore. I’ll probably scrape all the important threads from here and keep them archived and just leave it at that. My community is the IRC.</p>
<p>I’m not even going to bother reading through to check the grammar.</p>

<p>Just for you, I’ll reword the last part. Apparently the general gist of it all was too difficult to comprehend.<br>
I made threads on the topic before, where I pointed out that the forum was declining. The fact that it was dying was accepted, sure. I agree with you that nobody cared, yet it was accepted. Sure. However, I believe that people were under the assumption that it would be resolved somehow. So the fact that it was dying (which I’ve already said was accepted), felt laughed off because of the false assumption that something would magically fix the problems. It wasn’t taken seriously, the whole idea of it. So no action was ever taken.</p>
<p>Yes, you can argue not caring doesn’t equate to laughing it off. If we’re going to be tricky about words, you could argue both ways. When I don’t care about something, I laugh it off. I suppose you could also argue that because I’m saying that they accepted the dying, then they accepted the death too. Which makes the above not make sense. So replace the word dying with declining and you’re all good to go.</p>
<blockquote>treesuqsbawlz:. "oh the community will always be fine ararararar"</blockquote>
<p>Yes. I’m not arguing here that people didn’t accept it was dying (or declining. see above). I argued that they thought it would all be alright regardless. That they didn’t care and now they do care, when it’s too late. Even though my explanation may be a bit messy and all over the place (it happens), I think the general gist should be clear.</p>
