<p>that’s some fucking dedication right there. it’s not like he was talking to himself to fulfill some need for friends. he was doing it for the sake of his playerbase</p>

        <p>I’m not sure who it was, but as I was scrolling through the comments I saw a comparison between R-S mods and ours; I never laughed so hard in my life. The mods over there may not be 100% flawless and reliable, but they sure as hell beat the so-called mods we have here.</p>
<p>We aren’t ever going to regain popularity because you oldfags throw a bitch fit whenever someone suggests we update our shit “NO MOMMY I DONT WANT TO. I WANT TO REMAIN IN THE PAST AND CONTINUE SUCKING ON YOUR HARD NIPS” - let’s all face the music… it’s over. The only people who will remain are the ones who dedicated their entire teenage years to this site (i’m mostly referring to david lmfao)</p>
<p>moparscape is like myspace and r-s is like facebook. simple as that.</p>

        <p>This community, <span class="bbcode-i">by far*</span>, has more mature members. The staff deal in affairs appropriately and don’t use the boards as a way to get an ego trip when they are feeling insecure. A majority of the older community are transitioning into their careers, children, family. Runescape as a game has gone beyond its golden age, this forum will stand as a good nostalgic reminder of those good old days. It will also be a good place for people to talk about programming, and game development. I know a good number of people from this forum are moving into game development, and its more promising than the attempts I see from there. Two of the moderators have created awesome game products already that look well polished and show promise. Hell, Blackwake possibly has already gone as far as I think games will go being created from this forum.</p>
<p>So trying to come to an agreement about what we should do, when there’s little to work with, always ends in frustration. It’s not a problem we can fix given the time we are in now. The resources don’t exist. Runescape emulation development falls beyond the scope I think people understand and was quickly turned into a cheap imitation; low skill ceiling, high rewards. Runescape as a game had defects from the get go, and if you want me to discuss that history by all means I’d love to. It was doomed to die because of the shifting tide of the game industry and the interest for certain genres. It fell out of the minds of people who found it fun, and that was its life blood.</p>
<p>Now the bot development scene, that is quite interesting. I think we do that much better, for history, but of course for modern practices you should visit rs-hacking or get in touch with some bot developers. A majority of them are quite nice! Very intelligent group of people. Even then the topics of bot development are also way beyond the scope that people normally can reach. It’s something a two to three year computer science student could get into, but not someone normally educated from high school. Graph theory, evolutionary algorithms, cryptography, data structures are all very dense subjects.</p>
<p>Your analogy is spot on. We are a, well, place people who want to just hang out and communicate with friends want to be. Not a MySpace more of a, well what we are now. An old forum. And that’s okay. The comparison is moot, and if you think they do it better go play with the kids. I mean that literally, I’m sure a majority of their userbase is under the age of 18. I think the average age here is 19-22, if not beyond that.</p>
<p>Leave David alone. He’s a cool guy, and he’s passionate about this website still. He’s not here to make this his job, this site was a hobby and another home for a lot of us. A place to talk to friends, a place to learn. It will continue that way, until the cord is pulled.</p>

<p>That’s debatable, in regards to which community has the most mature members. It’s a shame, honestly - I hate to admit it, but when I was younger I looked up to quite a few members of this community, members of which who despised me for events I have yet to become aware of; one of said members includes you, sinisoul, along with David. I’m straying away from the point at hand: I would like to believe our community has the most mature members, but it’s rather difficult. Have you read the comments from the ‘highly respected’ members of this community lately? The majority of them completely belittle the newer members, and knock everything they have to say.</p>
<p>There are indeed a few promising games that are in development that started here on mscp, but those are the few who wanted to go above and beyond RSPS, which is quite rare, tbh. What are the chances that others will feel the same and actually do something about it? Let me answer that for you: the chances are slim to none.</p>

<p>I’m not saying it’s possible to regain popularity over-night, that’s virtually impossible. However, I have came across a ton of decent suggestions that would put us on the right path to redemption, but they’re always knocked by others for absolutely no reason at all. I’m aware that this forum was created for the ones who wished to cheat the RS scene, but isn’t it possible to slowly, but surely, stray away from the cheating scene and dedicate our forum to something else, something more appealing to the newer generation? If not, i’m sure there are still other ways to improve mopar, we just need to put our heads together and think outside of the box.</p>

<p>David and I have always had a falling out with one another, and I’m not exactly sure of the reason behind it. I suppose it was due to my stubbornness and retardation from when I was younger? I mean, that’s a highly likely possibility. I have nothing against him, regardless of what I say.</p>
<p>I don’t know - I know I’m not a vet or anything, but I did join this forum back in 2010 and would hate to see it die out completely, as i’m sure most of you would too, especially the one’s who joined back in 06-07, along with the ones who have made major contributions to not only the site, but the community as well.</p>

I’ve been banned from r-s 4 times and each time I just had to send across $10 to a mod (who im not naming) to get unbanned. I’ve pm’d the evidence to tom (account details and paypal screenshots) and he can confirm it’s legit.</p>
