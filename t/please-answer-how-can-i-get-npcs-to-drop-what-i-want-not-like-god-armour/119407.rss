    <title>Please Answer! How can I get NPCS, to drop what I want not like god armour</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-answer-how-can-i-get-npcs-to-drop-what-i-want-not-like-god-armour/119407</link>
    <description>Ok well I know how to make them drop things, but in the NPC.cfg file, I set them say a &#39;man&#39; to drop 15 coins and he does drop that but also bones and low level items and occasionally d meds and god armour...? Then barrows even though I tell them to drop the right armour I never get barrows armour :(. So any idea what I could do please to make them drop what I want. Im using realistic scape source. Also what does &#39;drop type&#39; mean?

Thankyou.
