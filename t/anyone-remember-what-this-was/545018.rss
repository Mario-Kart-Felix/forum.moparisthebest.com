    <title>Anyone remember what this was?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-remember-what-this-was/545018</link>
    <description>I need help remembering what this was. My description may seem vague but I need your help! ([b]this info is what I remember from probably 5 or so years ago[/b])

Ok, so you would download this program and a small black window would be open in the bottom right corner of your screen with a bunch of IP&#39;s, as well as your own for hosting a private server, even if you weren&#39;t running one. You would click on one or something like that and join it. Typically there would be a ::starter function and a place for training, usually a random open space with a massive amount of different leveled NPC&#39;s manually spawned there. You could get 99 in 5 minutes and the NPC&#39;s would drop very random stuff, like a dragon would drop dboots, a whip, and cash all at once sometimes. You could also obtain a b ring, or some kind of ring I can&#39;t remember if it&#39;s b or some other letter, anyway it would make all of your damage stats 99999 and you would 1 hit literally anything.

I am searching for servers similar to this.

I am also searching for servers where you can level past 99 and have cool custom/upgraded weapons that don&#39;t require you to donate or something like that.</description>

              <p>The program you are talking about is hamachi I believe. The rest of what you’re talking about is just server features, which you can look for on the Server Status Page or advertisements board.</p>
