    <title>97 Things Every Programmer Should Know</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/391531</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, I&#39;ve recently subscribed to a site called Safari Books Online. It&#39;s basically a digital library containing a plethora of technical and technological documents. Things from learning programming languages, to developing operating systems and so much more. Today I stumbled upon a book that I&#39;d like to share with you all. I take no credit for any of these ideas, and I am simply trying to help some of the members of this community.

All ideas and concepts belong to their respective owners, I am simply rewording it to keep within the word limit.

EDIT: Instead of actually rewriting the book basically, I&#39;ll just post a link to the download:

At first it might seem like a lot of reading, but it will certainly help become a better programmer, for those who will accept it.</description>
