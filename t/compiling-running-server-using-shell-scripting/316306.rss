    <title>Compiling/running server using Shell scripting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compiling-running-server-using-shell-scripting/316306</link>
    <description>Difficulty: 3/10
Requirements: An application that handles shell scripts (i.e. Terminal.app located in your utilities folder.)

We&#39;re going start this tutorial off with an explanation of shell script.
Shell is the equivalent of the command prompt for mac. It&#39;s remotely related to java, in that it has variables, if-then/if-then-else statements, do-while statements, and input/output.
This script will contain variables, input reading, output, and if-then-else statement.

Scripts are saved with the .sh file extension and can be edited outside of terminal, or whatever your using.

So finally, we&#39;ll get started with the actual tutorial.
So open up TextEdit, or anything that can edit shell scripts, and paste this:
[code]#!/bin/sh

# Compiler.sh
# Created by TheChubbyBunny @ Moparscape forums
#

printf &quot;Please specify your server&#39;s path:&quot;

read MYPATH

echo &quot;your server is located in $MYPATH&quot; #just basically a test to see if it&#39;s reading the input

cd $MYPATH


printf &quot;Please specify an action: &#39;compile&#39;, &#39;run&#39;, or &#39;both&#39;:&quot;

read ACTION

if [ &quot;$ACTION&quot; = &quot;compile&quot; ] ; then
	
	javac *.java
	
	echo &quot;compiling server...&quot;

elif [ &quot;$ACTION&quot; = &quot;run&quot; ] ; then
	
	java -Xmx256m server
	
	echo &quot;running server...&quot;

elif [ &quot;$ACTION&quot; == &quot;both&quot; ] ; then
	
	javac *.java
	java -Xmx256m server
	
	echo &quot;compiling and running server...&quot;
else

	echo &quot;Error in specifying an action, please re-execute the script&quot;

fi[/code]

Save it as compiler.sh, and [B][U]SAVE IT IN YOUR HOME FOLDER, OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK.[/B][/U]
Well, just make sure the script is in your home folder.

Now open up Terminal or whatever, and type this:

[code]chmod +x compiler.sh[/code]

This makes the script executable
Now type this:

[code]./compiler.sh[/code]

That command will run the script.

Here&#39;s a screenshot of what it will look like:

Here&#39;s some pointers:
- If you don&#39;t type compile, run, or both right, the script will not be ineffect anymore, I can&#39;t do anything about that as far as I know
- Once you specify an action (Input compile, run, or both) you&#39;ll have to re-execute the script to do another one, again, I can&#39;t help it
