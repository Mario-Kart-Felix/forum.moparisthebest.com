              <p>I can tell just by the look of the model where the faces are, and it is a little excessive.</p>
<p>When making models, try not to use the 6+ face cylinder prims. It uses too much poly you don’t need, instead make a square and rotate it on an angle so you’re it like | | |. It allows for easier manipulation and a whole lot less hassle then having one which seems “rounder”. It might seem a little blockish but a setting can be changed to make it smoother without adding all the faces.</p>
<p>Great design, just need to work on the execution. I look forward to seeing more models, and seeing you improve.</p>

              <p>I like the design of it  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> but the color of the bottom handle doesn’t fit in , maybe make it the same color as above? , And what do you mean by not finished? what else are you going to modify or add to the model?<br>
It’s nice to see people post models here , i wish it happens more often though. Keep it up bro!</p>
