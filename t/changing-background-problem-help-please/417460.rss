    <title>Changing background problem (HELP PLEASE)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-background-problem-help-please/417460</link>
    <description>So, I am currently working on a PI server, Its 474 source called WildernessReLoaded.

 So when i go to the client, in both the folder with the java files, and the folder with the class files, theres a cache in both of those files. So i open up the java on to change the background, and i see a background thats different then thats currently on the client. I edit it to mine, and save and replace. and it still doesnt change the background, so i change it in both the cache in the java and class folders, and still nothing.

I need help desperatly, please help me.  :(</description>
