    <description>[i]Note: We actually have players. A fairly decent amount for such an overpacked cache on a server aimed primarily at younger children.[/i]

[u]*Will add pictures soon, current links are being censored.[/u]

The last standing Delta server with 700+ customs with more than 30 players?

[url=http://projectrainbow.net/webby.php]Webclient[/url]

Server Info:
Average Player Count: [b]20-50[/b]
Type: [b]Delta 317[/b]
Accomplishments: [b]Top Delta on RL (#50), #13 on Mopar, Top Customs Server[/b]


Are we one of the only few Delta 317 servers left?
Yes, we are.

Hmm.. So what is Project Rainbow?

We are the greatest 317 revision server with customs items! Something that would defy every single other server, and revolutionize the private server world. We are proud and fortunate to announce that we have the most, the best, and the coolest customs! Come and join the community of legends, we are here for you!

In June of 2011, the owners have decided to spice up Rainbow. 
Since most of the servers up there are all obsessed with player killing, we have 
upgraded our stats and added some PKing for those elite pkers. We have fully functional pk systems, pk shops, pvp drops (random, yes!) and anything else.Since August, you can now build your own houses! :D

First server with [b]CHEMISTRY[/b] baby! Bind compounds to poison opponents!

We will never reset all of our player accounts, so this is a worthwhile server to play.

If you like PKing but hate customs, it’s easy to adapt! :)

Arcanian Weapons/Photon/Rainbow Claws/Halogen Blades/Oblivion Bow/Guns
VS
Regular and BORING Runescape items (Which most servers have unfortunately)

Boring, boring, boring! We want something more creative!

The thing that differentiates this server is that we will NEVER reset all players. This server is the most worthwhile to play.

Anyways,
Why play Project Rainbow?

he just responded your comment by saying it wasnt laggy.  :|[/quote]</p>
<p>I already said to Lin I would leave this alone but I digress and feel that I need to further my responses to make it clearer.</p>
<p>I said client lag, therefore being particularly strainful on the computer (your users) because of the possibly large load times. That + various bugs can occur (as they always appear) which feature client crashes could affect gameplay.<br>
Large load times -&gt; bugs -&gt; client crashes -&gt; time spent simply loading over and over again (estimated a fair 6 hours apart but still, annoying).</p>
<p>I implied that it wasn’t server lag because you said “40 people online” without a problem, which gives me insight that you’re running it off a decent server and can handle the connections, packet swapping, etc.</p>
<p>There are two different kinds of lag (well, main types).</p>
<p>Regardless, onto the topic and the server. It seems well managed, however, the overuse of customs turns me away from the content because it turns me away from the overall appeal.</p>

<p>Are we one of the only few Delta 317 servers left?<br>
Yes, we are.</p>
<p>Hmm… So what is Project Rainbow?</p>
<p>We are the greatest 317 revision server with customs items! Something that would defy every single other server, and revolutionize the private server world. We are proud and fortunate to announce that we have the most, the best, and the coolest customs! Come and join the community of legends, we are here for you!</p>
<p>In June of 2011, the owners have decided to spice up Rainbow.<br>
Since most of the servers up there are all obsessed with player killing, we have<br>
upgraded our stats and added some PKing for those elite pkers. We have fully functional pk systems, pk shops, pvp drops (random, yes!) and anything else.Since August, you can now build your own houses! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>First server with <span class="bbcode-b">CHEMISTRY</span> baby! Bind compounds to poison opponents!</p>
<p>We will never reset all of our player accounts, so this is a worthwhile server to play.</p>
<p>If you like PKing but hate customs, it’s easy to adapt! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Arcanian Weapons/Photon/Rainbow Claws/Halogen Blades/Oblivion Bow/Guns<br>
VS<br>
Regular and BORING Runescape items (Which most servers have unfortunately)</p>
<p>Boring, boring, boring! We want something more creative!</p>
<p>The thing that differentiates this server is that we will NEVER reset all players. This server is the most worthwhile to play.</p>
