    <title>Can&#39;t get server online, HELP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-get-server-online-help/218213</link>
    <description>Well... i have downloaded a source all-star scape V.2
My router is Net Comm NB5 ADSL+2 modem, to port forward i go to advanced settings&gt;application&gt;port foward.
I&#39;ve set 2 at the moment, One resulting to my default gateway 192.168.1.1 and the other the one that my DUC client says that it is updating too.
I go to server status and try to add it, but then it says &quot;sorry, (server name) must be online before you can register it here&quot;.
I was wondering maybe i did something wrong, forgot something or just completely misunderstood this whole private server thing.. If you think you know whats wrong, please post and help me out. i don&#39;t understand, im new to this port-fowarding and such :confused:

thanks
