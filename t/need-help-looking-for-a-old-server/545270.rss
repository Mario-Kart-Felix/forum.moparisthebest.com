    <description>Hello everyone. I am looking for a old server I use to play. I&#39;ll explain it in detail and hopefully someone can recognize it for me.

The server client had this picture as the background.[img]http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110223024829/runescape/images/7/70/Barrows_Brothers_1920x1200.jpg[/img].

Also, the entire client had 1 song playing through out the entire time you had it opened and it would keep repeating. The song was Escape The fate - The Ransom. Here is a link to the song.

If this rings a bell to anyone can you please post what the server name was?
