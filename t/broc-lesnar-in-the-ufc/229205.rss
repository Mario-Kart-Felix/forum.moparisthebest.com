    <title>Broc Lesnar in the UFC...?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/broc-lesnar-in-the-ufc/229205</link>
    <description>Okay, probably a few of you know he was a WWE superstar, seeing as you all watch that crap. Anyway, I knew he was knew to the UFC, but I didn&#39;t know he was a WWE superstar. Looking at pictures of him, he is obviously on the juice. Now, what I wanted to know was how he got in the UFC? The UFC has more steroid tests than many of the other sports. Now, I saw his first fight against Frank Mir at UFC 81, and I was impressed for his first fight. Only tonight I find out he was a superstar in the WWE. I was pissed off to find this, as that faggotry does not belong in the UFC.

I know he wrestled professionally when he was young, but I would like a bit more information; can someone please help me find any? I&#39;ve watched all promos about it, etc.</description>

Negros, obviously the punches are fake, otherwise, as pointed out earlier, you would suffer severe concussions.  But, I doubt any of us could last a scripted WWE fight like the ones the superstars have, cause uh, it’s kinda hard to fake jumping like 60 feet of the top of that cage thingy and landing on the ground.<br>

<p>Home dawg, I was talking about the special event they once had where there were three cages on top of each other and people fell off them.  Seriously, that just hurts.</p>
<p>60ft…you’re an idiot. they fall like 16ft on to a springed floor. the superstars also train to do jumps+landings like that so they DONT hurt themselves.</p>
<p>also, falling 16ft is hardly getting the shit beaten out of you…[/quote]</p>

Anyway, I knew he was knew to the UFC, but I didn’t know he was a WWE superstar. Looking at pictures of him, he is obviously on the juice. Now, what I wanted to know was how he got in the UFC? The UFC has more steroid tests than many of the other sports. Now, I saw his first fight against Frank Mir at UFC 81, and I was impressed for his first fight. Only tonight I find out he was a superstar in the WWE. I was pissed off to find this, as that faggotry does not belong in the UFC.</p>
<p>I know he wrestled professionally when he was young, but I would like a bit more information; can someone please help me find any? I’ve watched all promos about it, etc.[/quote]I agree 100%.  WWE is the stupidest shit on tv.  Everyone takes steroids, it is just stupid.  As if they are hitting people with chairs.</p>
<p>Anyhow, there are tons of performance enhancing steroids which can’t be tested for.  They probably were lenient on him in order to attract more WWE viewers to UFC.</p>
