    <title>Balloons</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/balloons/324740</link>
    <description>I know Frell did something like this and it&#39;s not the most original concept, but I&#39;ve been wanting a new background and after watching Up I decided to give it a shot. I also needed a break from my current project.

Here&#39;s the 1280x800 version and a link to the 1920x1080 version. If you need any other size you can probably get it from either of those, but if you have anything else you need or would like to say that&#39;s cool.

<p>actually i entirely disagree with this statement, it looks very good with that one solitary balloon in the centre being in focus when all those around it arent, is a very nice background<br>

<p>Just pointing out that there are 4 balloons in focus, although 2 of them are barely in. But you can really tell from the alpha channel.</p>

Almost center red.<br>
Far right green (can barely see in the 1280x800 version cause of crop)<br>
Top right yellow.</p>
<p>The yellow is hard to tell because of the saturation of that particular balloon, and the orange one is just barely making it.</p>
<p>BTW what does everyone think of the colors? I spend 98% of the time on them.</p>
<p>I made two different blues, two different reds, two different yellows, two different greens, an orange and a purple. Although there are tons of different colors because the materials change based on how big the balloons are, and no two balloons are the same size.[/quote]<br>
i did realise there were others <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> but its just the prominance of the fact that there is a single balloon in focus in the centre of the piece works really well, and the colours are very good, a variety but not too many, works well.</p>

              <p>Originally I had them more clumped, but it was more messy and most balloons didn’t look right. There’s about 1100 of them total, and when I widened the area they could spawn in it just spread them out and I like it more this way.</p>
