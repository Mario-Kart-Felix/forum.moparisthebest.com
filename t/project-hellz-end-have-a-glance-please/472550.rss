    <description>Hi guys and gals,

I have been out of the game for a LONG while. My brother called me up the other day and said &quot; oi bro lets make a private server for RS&quot; I lol&#39;d, but then it got me thinking, I work now and have the money to operate one. the only thing we lack is the knowledge anymore on how to do it lol, I have looked around and alot has changed over the years. I don&#39;t know what base we will use or anything I&#39;ll leave that for you to decide whats best seeing I don&#39;t know anymore, theirs alot more too choose from haha

Basically what i&#39;m putting forward to the community is an offer to help run a server (someone who knows what their doing) Our server hardware is coming to the DC very soon 

Specs:
Processor: 2xL5420 2.5Ghz (8 Cores)
RAM: 24GB
Drives: 500GB
5 IPs (Private /29)
4.5TB Bandwidth (fast BW)

I don&#39;t see paying for programming private servers as an option, but You do get use of a pretty decent dedicated server for any projects you may wish to test on it, you may use it as your own so long as it doesn&#39;t have a large effect on performance, I might depending how good you are at programming the server and running the server pay you some money here and their. You also MUST have skype and a mic, and be older than 18 (changed due to advice, will depend on the person) 

The website will be done by myself as well as a forum to go with and anything else we may need.

If anyone out their is interested please send me a PM I&#39;d be more than happy to answer any questions.

Regards,

Milo

AtomicInt<br>
myself of course</p>
<p>the following listed would be happy to help</p>
<p>also, anyone on here over 18 wouldn’t have time for a project like this… There are plenty of reliable people here under 18. Heck, there’s even a respected 12 year old on here that can program pretty well and from seeing him would consider him a reliable rsps partner.</p>
<p>All the best</p>
