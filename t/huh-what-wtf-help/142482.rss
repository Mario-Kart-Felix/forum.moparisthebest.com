    <title>Huh? What? Wtf!?! Help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/huh-what-wtf-help/142482</link>
    <description>OK here&#39;s my problem, Attacking is very slow on my server...I&#39;ve coded way too much to just start over. The attacking has a delay, idk if it&#39;s my computer or if there&#39;s something actually wrong that i can fix...but I&#39;ve tried changing the wepdelay and pkingdelay on all weapons to 1! And STILL it&#39;s extremely slow, like a lag i think. But it only happens when an npc or player is attacked...Lag only during combat. If anyone could help I&#39;d would Extremely appreciate it! Please Help![br][size=1]Posted on: September 10, 2007, 08:09:22 PM[/size][hr]sry for dp but i really need help</description>
