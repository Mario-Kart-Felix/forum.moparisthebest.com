    <title>Need tips on upgrading</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-tips-on-upgrading/338968</link>
    <description>Okay.
So, I want to upgrade soon, with the price hopefully being less than 1.5k.
I currently have:

[ul]Quad Core AMD Phenom 9500. (Might be slightly heat damaged.)
Nvida 9800GTX+ PCI-E 512mb. (Taken a bit of a beating.)
1.5tb/200gig Sata HD&#39;s
MSI MS-7367 Motherboard.
2Gig Kingston RAM[/ul]

I want to have something like:

[ul]i7 Quad Intel core (Don&#39;t know any good models)
Either a ATI Radeon™ HD 5970, or similar. (I need to get some information from others to go to Nvidia or ATI.)
4gig + RAM
A decent, good quality big gaming/air cooling case. I refuse to get water for fear of pipes bursting. I hate water, love air - just me. Because of my current case and motherboard layout, I had to melt the shroud of my Vcard just to fit it in.
A DECENT motherboard than the shitty one I have.[/ul]

Also, a good quality, cheap place to get these. I used to get my parts from MSY but I suspect there&#39;s other places that people might have struck gold.
Halp please?</description>

Taking that into account, where would you buy your parts from?<br>
Also, what motherboard would you recommend (being specific-wise, not just brand-wise.)?</p>
<p>[quote=“T4_, post:2, topic:338968”]<span class="bbcode-s">You seem oddly familiar.</span></p>
