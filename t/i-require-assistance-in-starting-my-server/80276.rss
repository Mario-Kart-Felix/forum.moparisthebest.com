    <title>I require assistance in starting my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-require-assistance-in-starting-my-server/80276</link>
    <description>Ive downloaded moparscapes 3.2 aryan webclient and have gotten myself a server. Now my problem is, how do I get said server online? I can utilize it from my desktop and access the program by simply clicking on the icon and logging in. But no oen else can use the server apparently because I must connect the server to the internet. How do I do this? Insight and enlightenment on this matter would be much appreciated, thank you.</description>
