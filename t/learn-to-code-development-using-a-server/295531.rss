    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/learn-to-code-development-using-a-server/295531</link>
    <description>[center]Welcome :)[/center]

I&#39;ve decided to basically attempt to create the easiest spoon feed possible on how to code a server.

How? Simply making specific things come up with dialogues on how to do some things :)

Purpose: I&#39;ve come to realize the only way to really begin to learn to code a P server is to use Deltascape as most of the code makes sense to even the most retarded of people and we need a new form of learning. What I plan to do is make this server basically one big-ass tutorial which; may seem stupid to many of you for reasons being, you&#39;re good with Java and feel my idea is just stupid (like I care)

Now, how this will work is; log in on tut. Isle, talk to the RuneScape guide for introduction, click the door to go outside to the survival expert - but wait, the door doesn&#39;t work? a Dialogue will pop up explaining how to make doors work.

The above is basically what the whole server will be, one big tutorial on learning the basics of a RuneScape Private Server. We&#39;re all tired of seeing un-edited sources and to be quite honest, I&#39;m sure many people are tired of seeing server developments that are DeltaScape with the home area changed, promising updates that never happen.

Now, I feel this post should not be locked/deleted as it will serve the true purpose of developing a server as you will have to learn to do [u]everything[/u] your self with help of Dialogues in the server :).


My hopes with this development is that we can reset the RSPS community&#39;s and start new sources from scratch. Of course this is not going to be some Pro-coded development that teaches you things that some of our best coders can do, but it will be a start. I see no harm in going back to fail-content servers because deltascape is now looking like a fail server thanks to kids thinking; OMG I HAZ VENGEANCE AND PVP I DID ALL WORK GF IM PRO.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[center]Extra information:[/center]

[center]Server completion: 2% (cleaning everything wont take long, adding the dialogues and options will take me the longest)

What base will you be using?: 
Figment F2p Pk, It was the best Project Czar until Prima came up with iClarity, it has what I believe to be the best NPCdrop system, it also has no features so there&#39;s no leeching.

Why do you feel this will help people?: 
Basically, I&#39;ve been noticing with one of my dyslexic friends at school that sometimes words mean nothing but Gibberish and a picture can tell a thousand stories which, Mopar himself even said.

Updates on what I have done:
-Cleaned out the auto spawn and doors.CFG
-Put the exp at RuneScapes
-Log in for first time, start at Tut isle.
-All .CFG files cleaned.
-Items.CFG has had all equipment stats set to 0, Values reset
-Npcs.cfg erased except one which will be used as a guideline on adding more.
-starting on cleaning client.java to remove useless bullshit that Czar seems to have.
-Dialogues added thanks to B B0yz 4
-Had to replace the items.cfg because it caused an issue
-Finished Tutorial Island
-Released V1.0
[/center]



One last thing, the rules say I need pictures? Sure thing, I&#39;ll post when I finish cleaning :)

<p>If mopar does not allow a server that teaches you the basics of private servers, then I suppose it’s no wonder everyone uses delta nowdays.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t released we’d still be trying to code Project Czars and majority of this community would still be leeching - Oh, wait never mind. This is moparscape: home of leeching.</p>
<p>Anyway, the mods have two choices when it comes to this.</p>

<li>continue seeing idiots releasing sources with home changed around and credits to themself.</li>
<li>actually move on from deltascape and learn how to do more things.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 18, 2009, 04:06:50 am[/size][hr]Almost ready to release V1.0[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 18, 2009, 05:31:25 am[/size][hr]updated, released</li>

<p>Yeah I hope that doesn’t go on with this thread… Seriously new comers need this though. Even myself but don’t make it a noob guide that show you how to use premade codes that aren’t really Java. Lot of people get that confused nowadays, stupid noobs lol.</p>

              <p>[center]Welcome :)[/center]</p>
<p>I’ve decided to basically attempt to create the easiest spoon feed possible on how to code a server.</p>
<p>How? Simply making specific things come up with dialogues on how to do some things <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Purpose: I’ve come to realize the only way to really begin to learn to code a P server is to use Deltascape as most of the code makes sense to even the most retarded of people and we need a new form of learning. What I plan to do is make this server basically one big-ass tutorial which; may seem stupid to many of you for reasons being, you’re good with Java and feel my idea is just stupid (like I care)</p>
<p>Now, how this will work is; log in on tut. Isle, talk to the RuneScape guide for introduction, click the door to go outside to the survival expert - but wait, the door doesn’t work? a Dialogue will pop up explaining how to make doors work.</p>
<p>The above is basically what the whole server will be, one big tutorial on learning the basics of a RuneScape Private Server. We’re all tired of seeing un-edited sources and to be quite honest, I’m sure many people are tired of seeing server developments that are DeltaScape with the home area changed, promising updates that never happen.</p>
<p>Now, I feel this post should not be locked/deleted as it will serve the true purpose of developing a server as you will have to learn to do <span class="bbcode-u">everything</span> your self with help of Dialogues in the server :).</p>
<h2>My hopes with this development is that we can reset the RSPS community’s and start new sources from scratch. Of course this is not going to be some Pro-coded development that teaches you things that some of our best coders can do, but it will be a start. I see no harm in going back to fail-content servers because deltascape is now looking like a fail server thanks to kids thinking; OMG I HAZ VENGEANCE AND PVP I DID ALL WORK GF IM PRO.</h2>

<p>[center]Server completion: 2% (cleaning everything wont take long, adding the dialogues and options will take me the longest)</p>
<p>What base will you be using?:<br>
Figment F2p Pk, It was the best Project Czar until Prima came up with iClarity, it has what I believe to be the best NPCdrop system, it also has no features so there’s no leeching.</p>
<p>Why do you feel this will help people?:<br>
Basically, I’ve been noticing with one of my dyslexic friends at school that sometimes words mean nothing but Gibberish and a picture can tell a thousand stories which, Mopar himself even said.</p>
<p>Updates on what I have done:<br>
-Cleaned out the auto spawn and doors.CFG<br>
-Put the exp at RuneScapes<br>
-Log in for first time, start at Tut isle.<br>
-All .CFG files cleaned.<br>
-Items.CFG has had all equipment stats set to 0, Values reset<br>
-Npcs.cfg erased except one which will be used as a guideline on adding more.<br>
-starting on cleaning client.java to remove useless bullshit that Czar seems to have.<br>
-Dialogues added thanks to B B0yz 4<br>
-Had to replace the items.cfg because it caused an issue<br>
-Finished Tutorial Island<br>
-Released V1.0<br>

<p>One last thing, the rules say I need pictures? Sure thing, I’ll post when I finish cleaning <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
