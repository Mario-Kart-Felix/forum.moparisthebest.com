    <description>ik..let me google it for you...blah blah blah. ive googled it and read it 100s of times. i know im doing it correctly but its not working...so ill explain how i did it and someone tell me what im doing wrong.

i downloaded the models and put them into my cache.. in the Raw folder.

i then added the ints to my client that match the models i put in my Raw folder..

the ints were placed in my itemdef.java which was then saved and compiled with 0 errors

log onto my client and into game..spawns items..nothing.

whats am i doing wrong?

i also saw some people made a Model folder and put the models in there..so i did that aswell..nothing

also i tried doing add model in game
typing in the model number..and it says unable to find model...</description>
