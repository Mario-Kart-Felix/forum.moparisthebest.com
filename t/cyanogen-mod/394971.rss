    <title>Cyanogen Mod</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cyanogen-mod/394971</link>
    <description>So I just installed Cyanogen Mod 7.0.3 on my Moto Droid, and I&#39;ve been having a few problems with it.  First, the phone never vibrates now, even though I have it configured to.  It doesn&#39;t vibrate when I get a txt, call, anything.  The other problem I&#39;ve been having is with the physical keyboard.  Most keys work right, but then the rest are acting as short cuts.  Like the &quot;E&quot; key opens the Email apk, L opens the Calendar, etc.  I&#39;ve looked through the settings, and I can&#39;t find anything that would do this.  So my question is, has anyone else had problems with this?  

Edit: My dad also just informed me that he&#39;s sent me about 3 txts in the past 15 minutes, and none of them came through.  Apparently that is also a common problem with Cyanogen on the Moto Droid... So another question,  is Cyanogen an over-hyped pile of shit?

Alright, so after searching on the Cyanogen forums for a bit, I think I&#39;ve got all these things fixed.</description>

Yea, I just noticed the 3g problem the other day… turning airplane mode on &amp; off is a good thing to know, I just restarted the phone…</p>

              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:4, topic:394971”]I’ve been running Cyanogenmod on my Droid since 5, and most recently with 7.0.3.  It works like a brand new phone, but I did do a full wipe on the last upgrade because the RC3 was very sluggish, though probably due to never wiping before and having a million useless apps on there.</p>
<p>So if you install it and do a full factory wipe at the same time, you probably wouldn’t have any problems at all.</p>
<p>Also, I thought you had a Droid 2?  Do you have the original Moto Droid, or the Droid 2? (which isn’t supported)[/quote]<br>
I have the Moto Droid (the first one), and I wiped the data &amp; cache when I installed it, or whatever ROM Manager does.  So I’m not sure why I was getting the problems, however I’m pretty sure the phone not vibrating was just some default settings that I accidentally skipped over.  The problem with the physical keyboard opening things, is apparently the phone thinks that the search button was hit when you opened the phone, so just hitting the search key fixes that. (Temporarily at least).  I’m not sure what was causing the problem with messages not coming through, but it was easily fixed by checking Settings&gt;CyanogenMod settings&gt;Performance&gt;Lock messaging app in memory.</p>
<p>Other than those few things though, CyanogenMod has been extremely good.  Using SetCPU to OC my phone has been pretty nice too, and I have noticed quite a difference with the phone not being as sluggish.</p>
