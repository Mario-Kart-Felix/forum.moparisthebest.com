    <title>New AC/DC Album</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-ac-dc-album/227061</link>
    <description>I am looking forward to hearing what AC/DC can produce after 8 years out of the studio.
It will be interesting to hear how much they have changed.

I still think that their best album so far is Back In Black, even though I think that Bon Scott was a better singer than Brian Johnson.

AC/DC will release their long-awaited new album Black Ice on October 18. It will be the band&#39;s first full-length studio album of new material in eight years.

The first single off the album, Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Train, will hit radio airwaves on August 28.

              <p>This will probably be crappy. Their last album wasn’t good at all. Their old music was tons better.</p>

              <p>AC/DC is awesome and this will be awesome.</p>
<p>As for your lead singer comparison, you are exactly right. Bon Scott was singing in his normal natural voice. Johnson uses a fake shitty imitation voice. I like them though both lead singers.</p>
