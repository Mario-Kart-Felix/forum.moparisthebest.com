    <title>GWD Interface not rendering on resizable/fullscreen mode?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gwd-interface-not-rendering-on-resizable-fullscreen-mode/536469</link>
    <description>Hey mopar, I was toggling client sizes today and I noticed that while I was in GWD my GWD Killcount interface wasn&#39;t rendering on resizable/fullscreen mode &gt;:O

I went into RSInterface and tried shifting the coords to the left of the screen maybe thinking it was rendering behind another interface but no, it&#39;s not rendering the GWD Killcount interface in any display mode besides fixed.

If anybody can help me that would be great :&gt;
I don&#39;t mind posting snippets etc, haven&#39;t been on the forums for a while so I&#39;m looking forward to feedback :3</description>
