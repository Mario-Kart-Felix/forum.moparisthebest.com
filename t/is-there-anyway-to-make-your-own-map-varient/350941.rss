    <title>IS there anyway to make your own map varient?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-anyway-to-make-your-own-map-varient/350941</link>
    <description>I have been wanting to make a game using RSPS, but I need to make my own map. Is there any program I could use to make a map? And then if I do, is there anyway to make it so I can play on it in my own client.</description>
