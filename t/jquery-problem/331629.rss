    <title>jQuery Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jquery-problem/331629</link>
    <description>Hi there.
So today I figured I was fed up with regular Javascript coding, and decided to look into jQuery and implement it.
Now, I&#39;m just trying to do a dummy function, and it&#39;s not working. Firebug is telling me that &quot;$ is not defined&quot;. I feel really dumb for asking this. My code:
[code]&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
    $(&quot;#test&quot;).val(&quot;This should be there&quot;);
});
&lt;/script&gt;[/code]
I&#39;ve checked to make sure that jQuery is included (I&#39;m using the minimized version, if that changes anything). I really can&#39;t figure this out








holy crap I&#39;m dumb. I was using &lt;script href&gt; instead of &lt;script src&gt;. I&#39;ve gotten too used to code completion.</description>
