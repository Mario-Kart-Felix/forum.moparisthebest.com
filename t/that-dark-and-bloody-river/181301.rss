    <description>That Dark and Bloody River: Chronicles of the Ohio River Valley
by Allan Eckert

Do you think history is boring?  Maybe in history books, but not the way Allan Eckert writes it!

This book is written like a very good fiction novel.  It follows various important figures in the history of the ohio river valley, including George Washington, Daniel Boone, Simon Kenton, Simon Girty, George Rogers Clark and many, many more.  Many of the stories are even told from their point of view, and when I start reading it, it is very hard to make myself stop.  It is a rather long book, weighing it at about 70 pages of foreword, and 653 pages of regular text (no pictures, but there are some maps and such).

The prologue quickly covers 700BC to June 1768, while the main book takes it from Saturday, July 16, 1768 to Monday, October 2, 1811.

That was a short review, but it is a really good book for everyone to read, and though it may sound like it, it is not boring at all :)

Has anyone else read this book?</description>

<p>Fixed. If this were just a book suggestion to us, what I changed doesn’t matter really. But if you’re submitting that for a grade or something. Well… Fixed.</p>

Oh, there is plenty of war, killing, scalping, all sorts of the worst torture you could imagine (indians were great at torture, probably the best).

              <p>I haven’t read it, I’m not overally much of a history reader unless it involves war or something, it needs to be interesting, and have lots of action, otherwise, I probably won’t get too far into the book without throwing it out the window. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>It’s also a long book, I usually don’t have the attention span for a book of more than about 200-300 pages.
