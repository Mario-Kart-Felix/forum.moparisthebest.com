    <title>«PI» Character file doesnt work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-character-file-doesnt-work/431749</link>
    <description>So i just logged in on a new source i&#39;m using, and so i just logged out to see my character files and putting my rights to 3, but i don&#39;t see my own character standing in the character file. So i decided to log-in on a other account to test wether i could change something on there, the character files are perfectly ok. whenever i change something, it doesn&#39;t change it in-game. For example, i tried to give a other account character rights 2 instead of 0, and nothing changed. I tried to give that same character 1000 pk points, didn&#39;t happen. Could any of you please help me?
