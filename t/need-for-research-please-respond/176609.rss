Usually I ring up, say I’ll be back by say 11, if I’m late doesn’t really matter unless I wake them up <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

3 I suppose, I have a tidyish room, but I suck at homework, for example tonight I have to do a biology and a chemistry practical writeup for tomorrow morning, one of them is coursework and I just cannot be bothered.</p>
