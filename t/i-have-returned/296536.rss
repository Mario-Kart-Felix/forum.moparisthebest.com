    <title>I have returned</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-returned/296536</link>
    <description>Hey Ya&#39;ll

So I haven&#39;t really been around for a while (not saying I was very active in the past), but I guess I&#39;ve decided to consider getting involved in the cheating community now that I&#39;m allowing myself to be readdicted to the games of the past. So, I ended up finding some random forum and before I could do anything found myself introducing myself on an intro board... So, I decided it would only be fitting to come back to the community that started it all for me, moparisthebest.com. But wait... is Mopar really the best anymore? I vote we change mopar&#39;s handle and the site name XD

I&#39;m a Comp Sci major right now and have found myself reverting back to my poor habit of wasting time with games I know have absolutely no meaning. Thus, I&#39;ve begun turning to hacking and cracking these games to make them so absolutely boring/beatable that I find absolutely no reason to play them a second time.  I know this is a somewhat backwards method of disciplining myself, but hey, don&#39;t judge So, I hope to contribute a few programs, learn a little bit from you all both in programming and in community building. (I&#39;ve done my fair share of running organizations and continue to do so).

Oh, and my approach to hacking/cheating (for the short term) is a packet sending one. I want to develop a program to imitate the client side of neopets browsing/gaming. Let me know if you&#39;re interested or have some tips for me. Thus far, I&#39;ve only done some basic reading on how the packet sending works and installed wireshark.

Thus far, my success in cheating has been two fold:
1. A few years back I created a few scripts for Runescape Scar botting and for Neopets botting with Scar.  During that time I used many Runescape/Neopets Scar scripts. I think my most fully functioning from scratch was an automation of the ice cream game, but I guess I never posted it up.
2. Recently I created a hacked version of the game [url=http://ElementsTheGame.com]ElementsTheGame.com[/url] and am considering releasing it, but not really sure. If you want to email me, I might send it to you and I can modify it relatively easily. Oh and if someone could reply and help me understand the whole no charging for programs thing? Does this mean I can&#39;t try to sell the program I&#39;m talking about through this site? Or does this mean that if I&#39;m known to sell my programs period, I&#39;m not invited to this community?

My online involvement with cheating communities has been limited:
1. Started hanging around Moparisthebest.com forums where I learned to script and got my scar up to speed.
2. Recently started looking around for new hacking communities to join and am noncommital about my involvement, but as you can see, I&#39;ve said quite a bit already so I&#39;m definitely considering being very active!
3. Currently I&#39;m building a Neoquest auto leveler in Ruby. (Or trying atleast)

Feel free to poke at my rant/introduction ^_^

Good to be back,
Mike
PS: Rofl that is an enormous intro! I&#39;m auto impressed by anyone who reads this 
PSS: Moparisthebest, you prolly don&#39;t remember me, but if you do, you&#39;re the reason I got into programming haha. I&#39;m not sure if you should put that should be taken as a praise or something to put on your conscience, but way back when I took your auto miner and basically removed the main from it and just added random code and expected the components to run on their own without a main and you laughed and taught me how programs worked from there haha. Thanks for the good times ^_^</description>

<p>Yeah I imagined as much. I was googling hacks for various games and didn’t see any scripts for SCAR! Well I liked SCAR a lot because it was so in your face with the code.

<p>Bleh, what else are boards for if not to type too much. I’m just surprised people read it… ack, maybe it does belong on live journal X_X “Hmm just need to add emo phrase here and talk about my child hood there and, done!”</p>

<p>Cool, I figured as much, but better to ask anyways? What’s your stance on ads? I’ll just ask people to shoot me an email if they want the source.</p>

So, I ended up finding some random forum and before I could do anything found myself introducing myself on an intro board... Oi look at this, we don't have an intro board!??! &gt;.&lt; Why!? Can we add one to moparisthebest?  (BTW, can anyone really say that Mopar is the best anymore... really? Hehe) Anyhow... here's my intro, pretty much cut n paste from the other community:</blockquote>
<p>I don’t see the need for an introduction section.<br>
A lot of us don’t care about the newer members.</p>
<blockquote>I'm a Comp Sci major right now and have found myself reverting back to my poor habit of wasting time with games I know have absolutely no meaning. Thus, I've begun turning to hacking and cracking these games to make them so absolutely boring/beatable that I find absolutely no reason to play them a second time.  I know this is a somewhat backwards method of disciplining myself, but hey, don't judge So, I hope to contribute a few programs, learn a little bit from you all both in programming and in community building. (I've done my fair share of running organizations and continue to do so).</blockquote>
<p>The flaws of this community add to it’s appeal.<br>
We like complaining.</p>
<blockquote>Thus far, my success in cheating has been two fold:
1. A few years back I created a few scripts for Runescape Scar botting and for Neopets botting with Scar. During that time I used many Runescape/Neopets Scar scripts
2. Recently I created a hacked version of the game Elements and am considering releasing it, but not really sure. If you want to email me, I might send it to you and I can modify it relatively easily. Oh and if someone could reply and help me understand the whole no charging for programs thing? Does this mean I can't try to sell the program I'm talking about through this site? Or does this mean that if I'm known to sell my programs period, I'm not invited to this community?</blockquote>
<p>We don’t allow the selling of programs on this board. You can conduct your dealings anywhere else though.<br>
Prime example being a member called Ruler.</p>

              <p>[quote=“aznph8playa, post:1, topic:296536”]Hey Ya’ll</p>
<p>So I haven’t really been around for a while (not saying I was very active in the past), but I guess I’ve decided to consider getting involved in the cheating community now that I’m allowing myself to be readdicted to the games of the past. So, I ended up finding some random forum and before I could do anything found myself introducing myself on an intro board… Oi look at this, we don’t have an intro board!!! &gt;.&lt; Why!? Can we add one to moparisthebest? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> (BTW, can anyone really say that Mopar is the best anymore… really? Hehe) Anyhow… here’s my intro, pretty much cut n paste from the other community:</p>
<p>I’m a Comp Sci major right now and have found myself reverting back to my poor habit of wasting time with games I know have absolutely no meaning. Thus, I’ve begun turning to hacking and cracking these games to make them so absolutely boring/beatable that I find absolutely no reason to play them a second time.  I know this is a somewhat backwards method of disciplining myself, but hey, don’t judge So, I hope to contribute a few programs, learn a little bit from you all both in programming and in community building. (I’ve done my fair share of running organizations and continue to do so).</p>
<p>Oh, and my approach to hacking/cheating (for the short term) is a packet sending one. I want to develop a program to imitate the client side of neopets browsing/gaming. Let me know if you’re interested or have some tips for me. Thus far, I’ve only done some basic reading on how the packet sending works and installed wireshark.</p>
<p>Thus far, my success in cheating has been two fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>A few years back I created a few scripts for Runescape Scar botting and for Neopets botting with Scar. During that time I used many Runescape/Neopets Scar scripts</li>
<li>Recently I created a hacked version of the game Elements and am considering releasing it, but not really sure. If you want to email me, I might send it to you and I can modify it relatively easily. Oh and if someone could reply and help me understand the whole no charging for programs thing? Does this mean I can’t try to sell the program I’m talking about through this site? Or does this mean that if I’m known to sell my programs period, I’m not invited to this community?</li>
</ol>
<p>My online involvement with cheating communities has been limited:</p>
<ol>
<li>Started hanging around <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> forums where I learned to script and got my scar up to speed.</li>
<li>Recently started looking around for new hacking communities to join and am noncommital about my involvement, but as you can see, I’ve said quite a bit already so I’m definitely considering being very active!</li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to poke at my rant/introduction <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Good to be back,<br>
Mike<br>
PS: Rofl that is an enormous intro! I’m auto impressed by anyone who reads this<br>
PSS: Moparisthebest, you prolly don’t remember me, but if you do, you’re the reason I got into programming haha. I’m not sure if you should put that should be taken as a praise or something to put on your conscience, but way back when I took your auto miner and basically removed the main from it and just added random code and expected the components to run on their own without a main and you laughed and taught me how programs worked from there haha. Thanks for the good times ^_^[/quote]Welcome <span class="bbcode-b">back</span> to the community <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
