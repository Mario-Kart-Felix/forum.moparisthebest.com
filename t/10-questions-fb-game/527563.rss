    <title>10 Questions (FB Game)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/10-questions-fb-game/527563</link>
    <description>So I am creating this &#39;game&#39; using a social network (fb) and need ten questions.
What would be a question that would be awkward (to answer) if you asked a complete stranger?

This is how the game works :
Click a random friend
Click a friend of that friend that you don&#39;t know.
Repeat until you&#39;re 4 people deep. (Pro creeper)
Choose someone the same sex as you (obviously females -&gt; males have better odds)
Proceed to get the questions answered without coming off as a giant creeper.
If you let them know of the game, you lose.
If they already know the game, you lose.
Post screenies/chatlogs for proof.

You can blantly ask the questions or try to act smooth (hell, maybe even state that you need the questions answered for some statistical analysis project)


Anyways, a few friends of mine are going to try to accomplish this and we need questions. What should we ask?</description>
