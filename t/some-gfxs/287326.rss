<p>You’re the “fucking idiot” if you think that I’m on the internet, typing to you, and you are sitting there, calling me an idiot when you have nothing else to do in your time. An “idiot” is either a person who’s IQ is less than 100 (mine’s over 100) or if they are stupid/retarded, which I’m not. Just don’t say anything to a person when he’s dead, it doesn’t make you “smart” or “cool”, you need to be a bit more “polite”, even if it is on the internet, we have feelings like you and we WILL reply to you flaming you back. I don’t care if you didn’t state that Michael Jackson was a gentle guy, you just said something random regarding a signature. If you were referring to the fact that him himself didn’t fit the signature, then I understand, but it’s actually the Bugs Bunny that ruined the image. I apologize for being a bitch, but it’s the truth. I hope we have no hard feelings, I didn’t know you weren’t referring his face ruined the image like the render was too big, or if you actually said that you thought he was ugly and it made the signature was ugly, which is what made me mad. Sorry for the inconvienience. I’m sorry if this comment offends you.</p>

<p>Not trying to undermine your post or anything, just wanted to point this out:<br>
I think you meant to say ‘Just don’t say anything <span class="bbcode-b">about</span> a person when he/she is dead’, instead of</p>
<p>[quote author=Full Metalst link=topic=379932.msg2865990#msg2865990 date=1247467600]<br>

[/quote][/quote]<br>
I’ll be honest, I don’t think sometimes, and that’s a habit I’m trying to break, thank you for pointing it out.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the post. They’re okay for a beginner, but you need to look at some tuts. You only need 1 focal, that’s the “eye-catching” segment in a signature.</p>

Anyways, on the Vader one, it’s kinda dull. Maybe add more colour to the entire image/make Vader stand out from the background more?</p>

If you are giving constructive criticism, go ahead, but if you don’t know what constructive means, then don’t post.  This is your final warning, I’m sick and tired of the bullshit that goes on the graphics section.  Help someone out when they need it, or don’t post, no one wants to see your ignorant and snotty comments.</p>

You’re one to talk. In an earlier post you complained about the media focusing on MJ without even really ‘knowing him’ (which angers you), yet you do the same. Regardless, this thread is getting majority derailed…</p>

<p>It’s sort of ironic that you talk about someone else not having the “fucking facts” when you yourself are wrong. He didn’t have skin cancer, he had vitilgo and lupus.<br>
And no “other guy” came into this thread and made up “some gay shit”. Rereading the thread, the only posts relating to Michael Jackson are:<br>
T4_ asking “What’s with Michael Jackson and Bug’s Bunny/Daffy?” - Question, nothing made up.<br>
scoobygod replying that “everyone knows on the inside michael was always a kid so i put something to resemble that” - You didn’t address this, it doesn’t fit your complaint, and it’s a comment on the knowledge of everyone, not on Michael Jackson.<br>
ZeroFreeze stating his opinion that “Micheal Jackson’s face ruins the image.” - An opinion, nothing made up.<br>
scoobygod replying with “im sorry but the sig is about michael jackson and idc how bad it is =) at least im paying respects to him” - Nothing made up on Michael Jackson.<br>
Tico saying “bugs bunny and Michael Jackson just doesn’t work.  Perhaps a white MJ and a black MJ in the background might change things for the good.” - again, not about MJ just commenting on the signature<br>
You replying to ZeroFreeze’s comment on the signature with “He’s dead, say something nicer. He was a gentle and sweet guy. Shut your fucking face.” <span class="bbcode-b">What’s this? It seems YOU just said something about MJ that you can’t prove</span>, as FastBawlz brought up in his post - which also doesn’t fit your criteria. Your post doesn’t fit your criteria because you specified “other guy”.<br>
You then commenting without proof on Neverland, however this also doesn’t fit the criteria as it doesn’t specify anything about Michael Jackson.<br>
Bowserjr2 commented on the signature.<br>
T4_'s post, which you most likely were referring to, which said: “I heard he was very gentle around a little child’s anus.” <span class="bbcode-b">BUT WAIT THAT ONLY TALKS ABOUT WHAT HE HEARD ABOUT MICHAEL JACKSON NOT ABOUT MICHAEL JACKSON HIMSELF</span> - which he may very well may have heard about him. It <span class="bbcode-i">doesn’t</span> mean that he made something up about Michael Jackson, it means he may have made up something about himself hearing something. If it were to fit your criteria, his comment would have to be along the lines of: “Michael Jackson was very gentle around a little child’s anus.”</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr</span> - Be more specific - don’t just say “other guy”. Also, get your facts straight, and learn to recognize the subject in sentences.</p>

What about the “Michael Jackson’s face ruins the signature”? That is a horrible thing to say, especially when they’re dead. If he doesn’t know him, then he shouldn’t talk. I just don’t like it when people on this community are rude as hell, especially the fact that they just kid around being assholes.[/quote]<br>
Some people don’t care that he’s dead + him being dead doesn’t change the fact that he was ugly as hell.</p>

<p>I don’t think MJ molested little kids. His voice wasn’t his fault. His nose wasn’t his fault. He had skin cancer. If he wasn’t dead, then yes, I would like to meet him because it would be a dream come true. Can’t believe that other guy would come into this thread and make up some gay shit about MJ.[/quote]<br>
It’s sort of ironic that you talk about someone else not having the “fucking facts” when you yourself are wrong. He didn’t have skin cancer, he had vitilgo and lupus.<br>
And no “other guy” came into this thread and made up “some gay shit”. Rereading the thread, the only posts relating to Michael Jackson are:<br>
T4_ asking “What’s with Michael Jackson and Bug’s Bunny/Daffy?” - Question, nothing made up.<br>
scoobygod replying that “everyone knows on the inside michael was always a kid so i put something to resemble that” - You didn’t address this, it doesn’t fit your complaint, and it’s a comment on the knowledge of everyone, not on Michael Jackson.<br>
ZeroFreeze stating his opinion that “Micheal Jackson’s face ruins the image.” - An opinion, nothing made up.<br>
scoobygod replying with “im sorry but the sig is about michael jackson and idc how bad it is =) at least im paying respects to him” - Nothing made up on Michael Jackson.<br>
Tico saying “bugs bunny and Michael Jackson just doesn’t work.  Perhaps a white MJ and a black MJ in the background might change things for the good.” - again, not about MJ just commenting on the signature<br>
You replying to ZeroFreeze’s comment on the signature with “He’s dead, say something nicer. He was a gentle and sweet guy. Shut your fucking face.” <span class="bbcode-b">What’s this? It seems YOU just said something about MJ that you can’t prove</span>, as FastBawlz brought up in his post - which also doesn’t fit your criteria. Your post doesn’t fit your criteria because you specified “other guy”.<br>
You then commenting without proof on Neverland, however this also doesn’t fit the criteria as it doesn’t specify anything about Michael Jackson.<br>
Bowserjr2 commented on the signature.<br>
T4_'s post, which you most likely were referring to, which said: “I heard he was very gentle around a little child’s anus.” <span class="bbcode-b">BUT WAIT THAT ONLY TALKS ABOUT WHAT HE HEARD ABOUT MICHAEL JACKSON NOT ABOUT MICHAEL JACKSON HIMSELF</span> - which he may very well may have heard about him. It <span class="bbcode-i">doesn’t</span> mean that he made something up about Michael Jackson, it means he may have made up something about himself hearing something. If it were to fit your criteria, his comment would have to be along the lines of: “Michael Jackson was very gentle around a little child’s anus.”</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr</span> - Be more specific - don’t just say “other guy”. Also, get your facts straight, and learn to recognize the subject in sentences.</p>

I like the Shredder one, but the image in the lower left corner sort of makes it seem off-balance to me. Maybe change the colours or something.</p>
