        <p>Age doesn’t exactly make the GFXer. If a 13 year old reads some tutorials and practices qand puts effor into his work, he’ll likely improve. If I install photoshop and ask an 18 year old to make me a signature he won’t know where to start even after messing around.</p>

<p>scooby most of the people here response negative like eww and shit. They can’t give CC even when there’s a thread how to CC.<br>
Yet these aren’t really bad. Work on 1 focal becuz now r just some images with some effects.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Wow, you’re right! Wait no, that can’t be, BECAUSE someone intelligent enough to make an accusation such as that, would be intelligent enough to know how to spell because. If I were you, I’d shut the fuck up, because you have no idea what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>They look like shit, because THEY ARE SHIT GFX. Period. He’s new, and absolutely terrible at it. Don’t make excuses for him just because he’s knew. Later on, when he’s actually decent at Gfx, he’ll admit they were hideous. The sooner he comes to terms with how terrible they are, the sooner he’ll try to better himself.</p>
<p>Why don’t you go back to Moparscape where you belong, and stay out of the Gfx section.<br>
[/quote]and you get to worked up over pixles… its just pixles dont get so cry babyish over it lol its not going to effect you at all how bad im doing but you dont have to yell and cuss at everyone else because dude this isnt real life mabye you think it is but its pixles.[/quote]</p>
<p>Worked up? I could care less about you and your work. Yeah, they’re just pixels, you’re right. But pixels which lead to careers based solely around how good an image looks. But yeah, how good you are at photoshop doesn’t concern me. But it obviously concerns you, you posted them here to either get a dicksuck, or get constructive criticism. If you can’t be arsed to even try and better yourself, no matter the age your at(I was 12 when I started). Then don’t expect anyone else to care.</p>
<p>By the way, for whatever reason you all think I was yelling, I wasn’t. The Caps Lock was to stress the importance of certain text. Oh, and you’re retarded, this is real life. Does your shit have to be printed out on paper for it to be real life? Most advertisements came from some digital form.</p>

I don't think MJ molested little kids. His voice wasn't his fault. His nose wasn't his fault. He had skin cancer. If he wasn't dead, then yes, I would like to meet him because it would be a dream come true. Can't believe that other guy would come into this thread and make up some gay shit about MJ.

It’s sort of ironic that you talk about someone else not having the “fucking facts” when you yourself are wrong. He didn’t have skin cancer, he had vitilgo and lupus.<br>
And no “other guy” came into this thread and made up “some gay shit”. Rereading the thread, the only posts relating to Michael Jackson are:<br>
T4_ asking “What’s with Michael Jackson and Bug’s Bunny/Daffy?” - Question, nothing made up.<br>
scoobygod replying that “everyone knows on the inside michael was always a kid so i put something to resemble that” - You didn’t address this, it doesn’t fit your complaint, and it’s a comment on the knowledge of everyone, not on Michael Jackson.<br>
ZeroFreeze stating his opinion that “Micheal Jackson’s face ruins the image.” - An opinion, nothing made up.<br>
scoobygod replying with “im sorry but the sig is about michael jackson and idc how bad it is =) at least im paying respects to him” - Nothing made up on Michael Jackson.<br>
Tico saying “bugs bunny and Michael Jackson just doesn’t work.  Perhaps a white MJ and a black MJ in the background might change things for the good.” - again, not about MJ just commenting on the signature<br>
You replying to ZeroFreeze’s comment on the signature with “He’s dead, say something nicer. He was a gentle and sweet guy. Shut your fucking face.” <span class="bbcode-b">What’s this?

You’re one to talk. In an earlier post you complained about the media focusing on MJ without even really ‘knowing him’ (which angers you), yet you do the same. Regardless, this thread is getting majority derailed…</p>

        <p>Apparently some of you didn’t read what I posted previously, and because of this, similar actions are occurring.  So I’ll say this again: if the lot of you don’t shut up now, and choose to continue the argument, all of you will receive mutes.  If you are giving constructive criticism, go ahead, but if you don’t know what constructive means, then don’t post.  This is your final warning, I’m sick and tired of the bullshit that goes on the graphics section.  Help someone out when they need it, or don’t post, no one wants to see your ignorant and snotty comments.</p>

Anyways, on the Vader one, it’s kinda dull. Maybe add more colour to the entire image/make Vader stand out from the background more?</p>
