You asked for comments and that was my comment, you imbecile. Shall I elaborate?<br>
His plastic surgery overridden face looks horrific; it just destroys the whole image in my opinion.<br>
Furthermore I agree with the opinion that a few others have voiced: Bugs bunny and the other looney tunes character don‚Äôt fit into the image.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Remove bugs bunny and use a picture of MJ in his young years, before he did all of that plastic surgery.</p>

You‚Äôre the ‚Äúfucking idiot‚Äù if you think that I‚Äôm on the internet, typing to you, and you are sitting there, calling me an idiot when you have nothing else to do in your time. An ‚Äúidiot‚Äù is either a person who‚Äôs IQ is less than 100 (mine‚Äôs over 100) or if they are stupid/retarded, which I‚Äôm not. Just don‚Äôt say anything to a person when he‚Äôs dead, it doesn‚Äôt make you ‚Äúsmart‚Äù or ‚Äúcool‚Äù, you need to be a bit more ‚Äúpolite‚Äù, even if it is on the internet, we have feelings like you and we WILL reply to you flaming you back. I don‚Äôt care if you didn‚Äôt state that Michael Jackson was a gentle guy, you just said something random regarding a signature. If you were referring to the fact that him himself didn‚Äôt fit the signature, then I understand, but it‚Äôs actually the Bugs Bunny that ruined the image. I apologize for being a bitch, but it‚Äôs the truth. I hope we have no hard feelings, I didn‚Äôt know you weren‚Äôt referring his face ruined the image like the render was too big, or if you actually said that you thought he was ugly and it made the signature was ugly, which is what made me mad. Sorry for the inconvienience. I‚Äôm sorry if this comment offends you.<br>

If you were referring to the fact that him himself didn‚Äôt fit the signature, then I understand, but it‚Äôs actually the Bugs Bunny that ruined the image. I apologize for being a bitch, but it‚Äôs the truth. I hope we have no hard feelings, I didn‚Äôt know you weren‚Äôt referring his face ruined the image like the render was too big, or if you actually said that you thought he was ugly and it made the signature was ugly, which is what made me mad.

<p>You asked for comments and that was my comment, you imbecile. Shall I elaborate?<br>
His plastic surgery overridden face looks horrific; it just destroys the whole image in my opinion.<br>
Furthermore I agree with the opinion that a few others have voiced: Bugs bunny and the other looney tunes character don‚Äôt fit into the image.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Remove bugs bunny and use a picture of MJ in his young years, before he did all of that plastic surgery.</p>

<p>Hitler is dead too - does it require me to say something ‚Äúnice‚Äù about him too? Did I ever state that Micheal Jackson wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúgentle guy‚Äù? You, sir, are a fucking idiot.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre the ‚Äúfucking idiot‚Äù if you think that I‚Äôm on the internet, typing to you, and you are sitting there, calling me an idiot when you have nothing else to do in your time. An ‚Äúidiot‚Äù is either a person who‚Äôs IQ is less than 100 (mine‚Äôs over 100) or if they are stupid/retarded, which I‚Äôm not. Just don‚Äôt say anything to a person when he‚Äôs dead, it doesn‚Äôt make you ‚Äúsmart‚Äù or ‚Äúcool‚Äù, you need to be a bit more ‚Äúpolite‚Äù, even if it is on the internet, we have feelings like you and we WILL reply to you flaming you back. I don‚Äôt care if you didn‚Äôt state that Michael Jackson was a gentle guy, you just said something random regarding a signature. If you were referring to the fact that him himself didn‚Äôt fit the signature, then I understand, but it‚Äôs actually the Bugs Bunny that ruined the image. I apologize for being a bitch, but it‚Äôs the truth. I hope we have no hard feelings, I didn‚Äôt know you weren‚Äôt referring his face ruined the image like the render was too big, or if you actually said that you thought he was ugly and it made the signature was ugly, which is what made me mad.

I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt think sometimes, and that‚Äôs a habit I‚Äôm trying to break, thank you for pointing it out.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the post. They‚Äôre okay for a beginner, but you need to look at some tuts. You only need 1 focal, that‚Äôs the ‚Äúeye-catching‚Äù segment in a signature.</p>
