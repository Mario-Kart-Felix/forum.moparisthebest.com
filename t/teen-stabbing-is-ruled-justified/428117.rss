    <description>http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/state/stand-your-ground-defense-upheld-in-murder-charge-against-jorge-saavedra-in-stabbing-death-of-teen

&lt;blockquote&gt;NAPLES, Fla. -- A 15-year-old who fatally stabbed his school mate will no longer face criminal prosecution.
A judge’s ruling, made public Tuesday, granted a motion to dismiss the second-degree murder charge against  Jorge Saavedra in the death of 16-year-old Dylan Nuno on the grounds that he acted in self-defense under Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law. The State Attorney’s Office has indicated that it will not appeal the ruling.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I found this interesting, I actually agree with the outcome of the case. If the events actually played out the way the article makes them sound, I don&#39;t see why it wasn&#39;t justified</description>

<p>If anything this makes him more dangerous because he’s unable to control himself in high stress situations. I realise it’s dificult but I’d expect most people to be able to withhold themselves enough to disable the assailant and then use some of that adrenaline to make a run for it.</p>
<p>You can defend these type of people but clearly this “overcompensation” is what can make a murderer. If his wife cheated on him in 20 years time whose to say he wont react with the same anger and vengeance.</p>
<p>I cannot agree with this sentence.</p>
