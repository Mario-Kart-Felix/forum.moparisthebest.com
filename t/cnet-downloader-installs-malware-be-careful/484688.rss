    <title>Cnet downloader installs malware.. be careful</title>

    <description>Today I realized I didn&#39;t have Malwarebytes (or any anti-virus software at all, heh) installed on my less-than-1-month-new computer, so I installed it. I put in my product key and registered the software, then did a full system scan. I found a Trojan.Dropper. For all of you who don&#39;t know what a Trojan.Dropper is, it&#39;s a...
[quote=&quot;Symantec/Norton&quot;]name used to identify malicious software programs that drop other malware files onto the compromised computer. A Trojan.Dropper is a type of Trojan whose purpose is to deliver an enclosed payload onto a destination host computer. A dropper is a means to an end rather than the end itself. In other words, [b]the dropper is usually used at the start (or in the early stages) of a malware attack.[/b] Once a dropper is executed, its own code is simply to load itself into memory and then extract the malware payload and write it to the file system. It may perform any installation procedures and execute the newly dropped malware. The dropper usually ceases to execute at this point as its primary function has been accomplished. Droppers are used by malware creators to disguise their malware. They create confusion amongst users by making them look like legitimate applications or well known and trusted files. They may also perform actions that mislead the user into thinking that nothing untoward is happening on the computer when in fact the Trojan may have already dropped and executed other malicious software.[/quote]

A post I found that somebody wrote recently (December 29, 2012) about this topic:
http://agonist.org/warning-cnet-downloader-installs-nasty-malware-without-permission/
[quote=&quot;&#39;Polizeros&#39; from http://agonist.org/&quot;]Yesterday I used the once-reliable Cnet to download software from their site. They suggested using their Cnet downloader, which I did. Just as I clicked Yes to download, I saw a tiny message saying it would install a search plugin called Wajam. It was too late to say No and besides there didn’t appear to be any option to do so. The installation of Wajam locked up Firefox after installing it on Explorer and Chrome. I uninstalled Wajam from Add / Remove programs.

Things then got much worse. After uninstalling Wajam, a message appeared when starting Chrome saying ‘Coupon Companion’ had been installed. I did not authorize that nor was their any mention of it. Cnet forums have many complaints about this stealth install of malware which spews ads everywhere. The complaints have been ignored by Cnet for months.

Now for the truly scumbag part. After uninstalling Coupon Companion from Chrome, I checked Add / Remove Programs and found it needed to be uninstalled there too. During that uninstall it had a box checked saying it would install a DNS tool, which presumably would have jacked my DNS. That’s right, The Coupon Companion uninstall program was trying to install yet another piece of malware, something which has to be a new low in sleaze. Hey, fu[b][/b]ck you Coupon Companion and fu[b][/b]ck you Cnet.

[img]http://agonist.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MSE-trojans.jpg[/img]

Malwarebytes found two trojans after the attempted install of the DNS jacker on my computer. Microsoft Security Essentials found three more.

[code]Files Detected: 2
C:\Users\You\AppData\Local\Temp\DNS.exe (Trojan.Dropper) -&gt; Quarantined and deleted successfully.
C:\Users\You\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\*randomly generated key*\DNS[1].exe (Trojan.Dropper) -&gt; Quarantined and deleted successfully.[/code]

Cnet used to be solid and reliable. However, based upon their slimy, unethical new behavior, I’ve deleted my Cnet iPhone app and will stop going to their website. I suggest you do the same. If you go to sleazy, unsafe areas you’ll probably catch something nasty.[/quote]

Addition to the above: Even if you unchecked the download for the Wajam shit, you still would have received the virus.


So if you&#39;ve had Coupon Companion randomly added into Google Chrome after installing something from Cnet, you definitely might want to scan your computer.
