    <title>[PI] Shops won&#39;t work after being added, I can&#39;t buy items, help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-shops-wont-work-after-being-added-i-cant-buy-items-help/373471</link>
    <description>For some reason, after I add a shop to the server, I can&#39;t buy the items in the shop.

Does anyone know why this happens and how to fix this?

I really need to get these shops added.</description>
