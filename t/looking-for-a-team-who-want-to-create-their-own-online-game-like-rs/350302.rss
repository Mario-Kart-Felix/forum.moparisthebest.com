    <description>hey,

i want to create an original and legal online game for people to play. but its got nothing to do with runescape.
im thinking of using a private server, but change the maps,cache,models,characters, so the game will be 100% ours.

it will be the new runescape! but more cooler and funner ( lol ) the game will probably be based on medi eval times or acient times, something like that. there will be weapons and wildy and stuff. you will be able to kill people, buy stuff ect.
i dont really have a name for it. but i just got a weird one.... here it is.... Revolution Reborn. or something XD
it will have skills but nothing like rs. it will have that inventory box thingy but it will be different some how.
there will be events, like xmas, easter, ect. im thinking of having 1 big massive surprise once a year where everyone has to kill this massive monster that invades, and everyone that dies wont loose there stuff and when they kill him the game gets destroyed because he broke everything and then thats when the surprise comes it. this is all i can really think of but if you have any ideas please tell me (:


what i need is:


•A Couple Coders
•Programmers
•Graphic Designers
•A Pro Website Maker (graphic designers can help with that aswell_
•Advertisers 
if your intererested add my msn or email me at

              <p>hey,</p>
<p>i want to create an original and legal online game for people to play. but its got nothing to do with runescape.<br>
im thinking of using a private server, but change the maps,cache,models,characters, so the game will be 100% ours.</p>
<p>it will be the new runescape! but more cooler and funner ( lol ) the game will probably be based on medi eval times or acient times, something like that. there will be weapons and wildy and stuff. you will be able to kill people, buy stuff ect.<br>
i dont really have a name for it. but i just got a weird one… here it is… Revolution Reborn. or something XD<br>
it will have skills but nothing like rs. it will have that inventory box thingy but it will be different some how.<br>
there will be events, like xmas, easter, ect. im thinking of having 1 big massive surprise once a year where everyone has to kill this massive monster that invades, and everyone that dies wont loose there stuff and when they kill him the game gets destroyed because he broke everything and then thats when the surprise comes it. this is all i can really think of but if you have any ideas please tell me (:</p>
<p>what i need is:</p>
<p>•A Couple Coders<br>
•Programmers<br>
•Graphic Designers<br>
•A Pro Website Maker (graphic designers can help with that aswell_<br>
•Advertisers<br>
if your intererested add my msn or email me at<br>
