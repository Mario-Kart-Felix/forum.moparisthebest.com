    <title>Problems With PVPScape Source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-pvpscape-source/48527</link>
    <description>Hey, guys, just a quick problem:

I downloaded PVPscape source and began running it through my server. After about 30 seconds of up time, the server gave a message saying that PVPScape was possibly under attack and that it needed to restart. After that, the server would not come back up. It told me that the port was already in use and then that I needed java to start up the server. I obviously already have Java. Any suggestions, resolutions, etc?[br][size=1]Posted on: January 16, 2007, 09:53:48 PM[/size][hr]Bump</description>
