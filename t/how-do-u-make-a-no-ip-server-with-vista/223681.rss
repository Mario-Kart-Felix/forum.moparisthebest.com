              <p>if you have silab items on your server you wont be able to use a moparscape client only a silab client and you dont put the private ip in your serveryou put it in port forwarding section of your router if you have on [br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 03, 2008, 06:32:03 pm[/size][hr]if you have a router then open up an internet browser and type either <a href="Http://192.168.0.1" rel="nofollow noopener">Http://192.168.0.1</a> or for some people its <a href="Http://192.168.0.0" rel="nofollow noopener">Http://192.168.0.0</a> (the first one usually works) log into your router after that has been done find port forwarding. Once you have reached this step type in the private ip address of the computer your useing if you do not know how to do this click start, ‘run’ and type cmd and click ok. in the command prompt type ipconfig and you should see an ipaddress that looks similar to ‘192.186.0.130’ the last three numbers will bedifferent than that. after you have done that enter TDC and UDP ports as 43594 if you only have one place to inter a port then put it in as 43594 and make sure the firewall for it is set to allow. this should help youwith portforwarding</p>
