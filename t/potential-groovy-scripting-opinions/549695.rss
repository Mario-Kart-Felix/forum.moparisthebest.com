    <title>Potential Groovy Scripting (Opinions?)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/potential-groovy-scripting-opinions/549695</link>
    <description>Sinisoul is working on his new base that will probably have a lua scripting system, but in the event that it doesn&#39;t work out I wanted an alternative that I could use. I was creating content in Java and it just got too ugly for my liking, and I didn&#39;t want to have to put other people through that either.

One the main advantages of this scripting system is that you can be as verbose as you like, but it also allows for a lot of shortcuts as you learn them. For example, normal java code will compile correctly, but you can also shorten code with the different groovy language specifics. This means I think it will be easy for other people to develop scripts rather than have to learn something like ruby.

Now I wont pretend to be a Groovy expert, I only heard about it a couple of days ago and only really been researching it for a couple days. However I think it looks pretty neat and will help cut down a lot of useless lines of code. (Anyone that does know groovy and perhaps sees bad practice please point it out, Im still new with this!)


bootstrap.groovy
[code=groovy]import static net.scapeemulator.game.model.Option.ONE
import static net.scapeemulator.game.dispatcher.command.CommandDispatcher.getInstance as cmdDispatcher
import net.scapeemulator.game.dispatcher.command.CommandHandler
import net.scapeemulator.game.model.player.Player;

public class Bootstrap {

    static void bind(type, args, closure) {
        switch (type) {
            case &quot;cmd&quot;:
                cmdDispatcher().bind( new CommandHandler(args[&quot;name&quot;]) {
                    void handle(Player player, String[] cArgs) {
                        closure(player, cArgs)
                    }
                })
                break
            case &quot;object&quot;:
                println &quot;bind obj&quot;
                break
        }
    }
}[/code]

test.groovy
[code=groovy]
bootstrap.bind(&quot;cmd&quot;, [name:&quot;test&quot;], {player, args -&gt; println args})[/code]

[code=java]    public static void main(String... args) {
        new GroovyScriptEnvironment(&quot;data/game/groovy&quot;);
    }

    public GroovyScriptEnvironment(String... roots) {
        try {
            gse = new GroovyScriptEngine(roots);
            GroovyClassLoader gcl = new GroovyClassLoader();
            Class bootstrap = gcl.parseClass(new File(&quot;data/game/groovy/bootstrap.groovy&quot;));
            Binding binding = new Binding();
            binding.setVariable(&quot;bootstrap&quot;, bootstrap.newInstance());
            gse.run(&quot;test.groovy&quot;, binding);
            CommandDispatcher.getInstance().handle(null, &quot;test test1 test2&quot;);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }[/code]

Will output: 
[tt][test1, test2][/tt]


Some of the code there like closures will seem foreign to some people, they are extremely simple and if you really do despise them you can create normal java methods and convert them to closures with a simple syntax (I think its .&amp; or something like that)


I&#39;ll put up more examples as I experiment, but what are your general thoughts on the idea?</description>

<p>Like each, find, collect, any, join, max, and min? OK, it seems like I’ve nothing to gain by learning Groovy when I have Scala.[/quote]It depends on the class. Most of them have some sort of helper method, for example File.eachLine</p>
<p>You can also define your own methods for any class (for example define String.metaclass.foo which does whatever you want, and then you can use “testing”.foo, etc), and things like that.</p>
<p>It can also all be compiled directly into java to use as java classes or Groovy scripts. You also dont have to learn a new syntax if you dont want to, you can just apply whatever scripting advantages there are as you learn them because pure java code compiles in Groovy. They are really just completely different languages, I guess it would depend on what you wanted to do.</p>
