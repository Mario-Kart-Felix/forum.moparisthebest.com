    <title>BT HH3 - Problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bt-hh3-problems/434158</link>
    <description>Hey all, since I changed over to BT HH£ (Home Hub 3) all connections inbound are being blocked.

The portforwarding and wirewall settings are the same as my 2.0 version, yet it doesn&#39;t let anyone connect. If I use my old hub (2.0 version) everything works fine, but soon as the 3.0 is plugged in, it blocks everything. All the portforwarding is the same, they never change the port forwarding section for any of their modems. But still connections are blocked.

Anyone else having this problem? Or is there a fix?

I&#39;d rather not turn back to 2.0 version.</description>
