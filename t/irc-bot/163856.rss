    <title>IRC Bot</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/irc-bot/163856</link>
    <description>Well, I got bored last night and decided to commit myself and write an IRC Bot, as all my other attempts fell short as I lacked the commitment. Well, I got started but ended up stopping after about 2 and a half hours on it, as I was extremely tired from racing. I ended up getting Monday (Today) off because I was really sore from a crash I had earlier, which has caused my knee to swell up. So, what better time to work on an IRC Bot?

I post this because I would like too see what you all think of it, and if so, provide constructive criticism as I have always figured the best way to learn is to learn off the best. There will and always will be, pricks that post and flame for some dumb thing. This IRC Bot is still kind of in BETA as I&#39;d like to find all of the kinks out of it, and release a version 1. So on with a version 2, as this was VERY fun to program, and I learned a lot. 

So far, the only bugs I can find are;

[ul][li]When the bot first joins the server, and someone goes to use a command, nothing happens. But after that, every single command works. I think I know the cause of that, so I&#39;ll have that sorted for the next release.[/li][/ul]

They seem to be the only ones that I can find, if you find any please post.

I&#39;m bored so I&#39;ll write a little backbone explanation of how the bot works.
Class SettingsHandler loads all of the IRC Bot&#39;s properties from a XML file, and then stores them in Fields. If that returns true, it continues and the bot then proceeds to open up a new Thread, ConnectionHandler, and inside the run method, it connects to the server, using the properties loaded.
Once the bot connects, the bot then calls parseInput in class InputHandler which as you may of guessed, parses the input. If a command is executed, InputHandler then calls parseCommand from CommandHandler, which parses the String containing the command, breaking it up into the host name and the actuall command.
customCommand is then called and parses it, executing whichever command is executed.

I was so bored, I even javadoc&#39;d every single method :/

I&#39;m sure your all eager to have a look at it and flame me about where I went wrong, so it&#39;s attached.
Enjoy,
Yz85Racer.

EDIT: Fixed a little bug that Rictoo told me about.</description>
