    <description>Ok, so I know there is a debate thread on the other section about this, but I want to discuss my current status with my mom. 

Ok, so my dad is currently in Japan for another 9 days and I am watching his house. My mom is one of the over protecting, nagging moms who love blah blah blah. I understand my mom&#39;s point of view, but I just can&#39;t stand her. So my mom wants me to spend time at her house, but I can&#39;t because I have responsibilities at my dad&#39;s house I have to take care of in the mornings and nights. 

So she comes over tonight and told me pack your stuff and lets go. I said no. She talked to her boy friend over the phone and he reccomended going to the police department to tell them. I did the research and discovered as long as I permission from my father to be here, know what to do in an emergency, feel safe and am safe then I am fine. Not only that, but I am nearly 17. I know this is the typical teenage rebellion moment, but I am calling out to someone who has been through this before. I don&#39;t want emancipation from my parents, I just don&#39;t want my mom to be in my life anymore. She said she&#39;d be happy to sign me over to my dad once he gets back, but until then we&#39;re stuck together. She is scared that if the state finds her guilty of neglect of abandonment that she is going to lose her career. I honestly am not that mean to put her career in danger, but how do i make it through this next 9 days of hell? 

The police said I have to call her every morning and night and stay out of trouble. First of all i have no criminal record so I don&#39;t know where that came from and why the hell call her.</description>

Couldn’t of said it any better. Spoken like a champ.</p>
<p>So, you can be 16 and ‘live’ alone? Where I live, you must be 17 with parent consent.</p>

<p>It’s nice to hear you still respect your mum even though you don’t want her in your life anymore. I say just stand your ground, although if she wants to hand you over to your dad then why is she still chasing you? Seems like things run a bit deeper. Have you tried expressing your feelings and asking her if there’s anything else on her mind that she’s not telling you?</p>
<p>What is her boyfriend like?</p>
