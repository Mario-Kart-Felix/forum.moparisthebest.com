    <description>This isn&#39;t necessarily the best topic to talk about on my birthday, but I&#39;ve been having some issues with my parents recently.

I want to know, are/were your parents over-controlling in a manor?

Ok, so my father thinks that because he brought me into this worlds that his opinion should never be questioned, and if I ever start to argue, he thinks I&#39;m insulting him or calling him stupid.  I&#39;m not calling anyone stupid, it&#39;s just my own natural reaction to question things and find the most logical solution.  He also thinks that he needs to be in control over everything, even the hours I sleep.  I don&#39;t get why he should have any say in when I sleep, I started going to sleep arround 6 P.M to 3 A.M, then doing any work I had leftover.  I did this because the amount of stress both my parents cause is unbearable at this point.  I know I live under their roof and in the same way, it&#39;s their rules, but they tell me to do things JUST because they said so rather than respecting my opinion as a human being in trying to find a simpler solution.

My mother, like many, is quite a hypocrite.  She always says that the opinion of my &#39;hooligan&#39; friends (even though they are plenty well-behaved I guess you could say) doesn&#39;t matter and that I should disregard their opinions.  On the other hand, if she is arround her friends she puts everyone to work to make everything clean and spotless, as usual for any guest.  The problem starts when I question someones opinion.  Lets say that they are talking about something, their jobs maybe, and I say there is a better way to do a certain thing.  My mother takes offense to it and punishes me.  I&#39;m not saying that their stupid or anything, I&#39;m just trying to help you get shit done faster.

I know I&#39;m making sound like I think that I&#39;m smarter than everyone, besides my peers anyway, but when you live in the middle of the redneck state, that will happen.

So let me once again ask you, are your parents over-bearing or over-controlling?</description>

I feel my balls and jump off of her and there is a leach clinched on to my ball sack. Neither one of us knew how to get it off, so we go back to the house and I have to pull out my nuts and let my parents put salt on my balls and remove this fucking leach. As they are removing the leech and my balls are bleeding from the thing sucking my blood, my dad brings up the fact that my cock is greasy and my mom sniffs my cock and says yes he had a rubber on and then have a nice sex talk with me and the gf. This was a little awkward.</p>

<p>For an example (even though it actually happened):  Once he came home saying<br>
dad:“Why isn’t this worksheet done?” (they can check my work online)<br>
me:“Because we’re not allowed to take it home, it’s a quiz”<br>
“Can’t you do anything else?”<br>
“Not really, the internet is down right now”<br>
“I don’t care we need to get this done”<br>
“Well I can’t right now, there’s no internet”<br>
“I don’t give a damn!  Now get up and do the fuckin work!”</p>
<p>I missed a day of school from the flu if you were wondering.  I needed to get on a certain website to finish it.  He then made me sit at a table for 2 hours trying to make me know what we learned the day I missed.</p>

I start it off something like that, many people arround here think they are better than everyone else, so maybe.  But you would think my parents would know the type of person that I am.  Most of the problem is with my father, he thinks he can control every aspect of everything, and to boot he has anger issues.</p>

              <p>That is a little tricky I suppose, But maybe you should try to explain to your mom it, then she could tell them. But I do understand how you feel there is many times where I will sit and watch my brothers, mom, or dad do something and I already have easier ways to do it. But I was always taught not to tell them what to do. So I normally wait for them to ask or I will just start laughing.</p>

I know this, but I’m in the conversation, they drag me into it by asking me any random thing, Probably not the best example though.  Besides, if you could do something in 10 minutes that you usually spend an hour doing, wouldn’t you want to know?  Sorry for trying to make for life easier then.  Not the right place for the conversation, I admit, but tell me this, when else should I tell them if I never see them.</p>
<p>About my sleep:  I sleep their to actually avoid my parents, they cause WAY to much stress, like I don’t get enough in my every day life.</p>

              <p>This isn’t necessarily the best topic to talk about on my birthday, but I’ve been having some issues with my parents recently.</p>
<p>I want to know, are/were your parents over-controlling in a manor?</p>
<p>Ok, so my father thinks that because he brought me into this worlds that his opinion should never be questioned, and if I ever start to argue, he thinks I’m insulting him or calling him stupid.  I’m not calling anyone stupid, it’s just my own natural reaction to question things and find the most logical solution.  He also thinks that he needs to be in control over everything, even the hours I sleep.  I don’t get why he should have any say in when I sleep, I started going to sleep arround 6 P.M to 3 A.M, then doing any work I had leftover.  I did this because the amount of stress both my parents cause is unbearable at this point.  I know I live under their roof and in the same way, it’s their rules, but they tell me to do things JUST because they said so rather than respecting my opinion as a human being in trying to find a simpler solution.</p>
<p>My mother, like many, is quite a hypocrite.  She always says that the opinion of my ‘hooligan’ friends (even though they are plenty well-behaved I guess you could say) doesn’t matter and that I should disregard their opinions.  On the other hand, if she is arround her friends she puts everyone to work to make everything clean and spotless, as usual for any guest.  The problem starts when I question someones opinion.  Lets say that they are talking about something, their jobs maybe, and I say there is a better way to do a certain thing.  My mother takes offense to it and punishes me.  I’m not saying that their stupid or anything, I’m just trying to help you get shit done faster.</p>
<p>I know I’m making sound like I think that I’m smarter than everyone, besides my peers anyway, but when you live in the middle of the redneck state, that will happen.</p>
<p>So let me once again ask you, are your parents over-bearing or over-controlling?</p>
