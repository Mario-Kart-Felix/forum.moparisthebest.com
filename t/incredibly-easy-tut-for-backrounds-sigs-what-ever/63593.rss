    <title>Incredibly Easy TUT (for backrounds/sigs/what ever)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/incredibly-easy-tut-for-backrounds-sigs-what-ever/63593</link>
    <description>OK, I just started PhotoShop not to long ago, and when I was playing around with it I found this worked decently so.... ya, we&#39;re shooting for something like this (made it for someone else) -&gt; [img]http://img295.imageshack.us/img295/8637/n00b1copyks8.jpg[/img]

Or something bigger, the size doesn&#39;t matter much it&#39;s just what your feelin&#39; like  :P

OK, open up a new file, I&#39;m just gonna use 500X500 for now.

Now change your first color, leave the second one black. For the first one were using a light gray, cbcbcb works fine. Now click Filter &gt; Render &gt; difference clouds

Hit ctrl+f 3 times.

Now go to Filter &gt; liquify
Just do ... a lot of random swirls. Spins, lines, jags, all that, all on the entire picture.
-&gt;[img]http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/2378/notfinishedwaveymg1.jpg[/img]

 Now make sure it covers up the whole screen. Should look like -&gt;
[img]http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/7418/finishedwaveyrk1.jpg[/img]

OK, lets colorize it. Press ctrl + u and check off Colorize

Put the saturation to 100
Set the Lightness from -30 to 0
Choose any Hue, thats just the color.

Now we have it colored, should look somethin like this -&gt; [img]http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/6149/coloredoa2.jpg[/img]

OkieDokie, from here add your text/render/pic what ever. I&#39;ll be adding a render and text.

Text:
Choose your favorite text. High light all of it, and in the styles tab, click the gray square box, this should make the inside of your letters empty. -&gt; [img]http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/9158/emptytextph9.jpg[/img]

Now get your magic wand, its the ... wand in your bar on the left...thing... what ever, click inside each letter while holding shift. On the last one click edit &gt; copy merged

Now press ctrl+d and then ctrl+v. Move your text into place where it fits exactly infront of the other text. Press ctrl+u and check Colorize again. Now put the saturation at 100 and the Lightness at 0. Choose a color that stands out from the others.
-&gt;[img]http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/2595/withtextxa0.jpg[/img]

OK, almost done, even though this part is optional.

render: go ahead and add your render, and anything else you need. Final Product &gt;

OK, so I did this for first photoshoppers, just like me. I know it&#39;s not that great, and I&#39;m tired, post back comments and rates and such</description>

<p>Thanks, any other comments?</p>
<p>Also, I’m changing final outcome because that doesn’t look very good.</p>
