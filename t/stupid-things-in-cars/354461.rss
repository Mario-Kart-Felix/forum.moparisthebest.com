    <title>Stupid things in cars</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stupid-things-in-cars/354461</link>
    <description>What i mean is, have you done stupid things, or been in a car with a person that has done stupid things and got/almost got caught for something illegal? If you got away, mention how :P Or even put a small story.

Me:
[ul][li]Went 100 in a 55 past a state trooper - managed to take a side-street and get away before he was able to get a good look at me car.[/li]
[li]Street raced and passed state trooper - The cop went into the ditch when turning around, so I kept going. They came a few days later asking about it. I knew nothing :P[/li]
[li]Stuck my ass out the window on the highway - Went to my friends house and put my car in his garage[/li][/ul]

I&#39;m actually a very safe driver when I want to be, I just gotta do stupid shit ever now and then.
Discuss :)

EDIT: Lol, for example, something stupid like this
