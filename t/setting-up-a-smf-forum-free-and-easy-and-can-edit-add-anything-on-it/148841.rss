    <description>ok, i did this on my own! (with the help of a friend forgot his name atm :/) i wasn&#39;t sure if this has been posted before because i am from moparscape forums i was just checking out moparisthebest forums.

[u][b]Please note:[/b][/u][u] this is just a tutorial how to setup smf forums free and still edit anything if you need.[/u]


first of you will need a ftp client, i recommend filezilla because its easy, it works and its free.

so go to http://filezilla-project.org/download.php and download it from there.

next you will need the simple machines forum source (smf stands for simple machines forum),

so go to http://www.simplemachines.org/download/ and download the FULL version, the others are older versions.

and last but not least the host to host it on the web for you :P now this is when it gets harder, i always have trouble anywhere els except hostwq its easy, it has it and its cheap. it supply&#39;s all a web designer needs. (i think)

now go to http://www.hostwq.net/ and click free hosting and sign up for it. (click paid hosting for your own .com .net .org ect. if you prefer to pay)

it will email you to activate your account so make sure you have gave it the right email address, now after you activate your account go login, witch is hard to find your first time, here&#39;s a picture were it is:


[IMG]http://i196.photobucket.com/albums/aa56/billyboy385/loginpicture.jpg[/img]


now, if you don&#39;t know your user name and password look at the email they sent you, this has all the info you will need too so keep that page up.

after you log on you will need to create a sql database [u]on[/u] your host so click on mysQl manager and create a database BUT remember! only put like one word such as smf, forum, or anything you want but keep it one word.

now remember the database name (its your username with _DATABASENAMEHERE at the end)

after you&#39;ve done this give yourself a treat lol it gets easier from now on end almost

now before you begin uploading files with your ftp client (filezilla) you should rename your smf source to whatever you want it to be after NAMEHERE.hostwq.net/SMFSOURCENAME

so be careful

next, (the hardest part)

you need to upload the source with filezilla 

so  Double click on your FileZilla icon from your desktop. Once you have done so, you should see the following:

[img]http://nfsupportdownloads.netfirms.com/graphics/filezilla.gif[/img]

Select File and then Site Manager. 

[img]http://nfsupportdownloads.netfirms.com/graphics/filezilla1.gif[/img]

Select New Site and name it to what you would like.

Once completed, please enter your the following information: (you can get it all from that email i have told you to save)

    * hostname: ftp.hostwq.net
    * port: leave it the way it is
    * servertype: leave it the way it is
    * logontype: normal
    * userid: 
    * password: your ftp account information


 Click connect, You are now connected!

ok, the right side is the website stuff, the left is the stuff on your computer, locate the smf source on the left side and now on the right side double click the name of your website and then you should see htdocs folder, now click and hold your mouse over the smf source folder and move and let of the clicker on the htdocs folder and it should start to upload, it will take like 5 minutes around

once its uploaded go to http://WEBSITENAMEHERE.hostwq.net/SMFSOURCENAMEHERE/install.php and you can install it with the mysql settings:

MySQL server name: [b]sql2.hostwq.net[/b]

MySQL username: [b]youruserid[/b]

MySQL password: [b]your password[/b]

MySQL database name: [b]the name of your database you made[/b]

MySQL table prefix: [u][b]just leave it the way it is[/b][/u]

now that thats done (guessing there&#39;s no errors) you can install the easy little thing from there, after words, go to http://WEBSITENAME.hostwq.net/NAMEOFSOURCE/index.php 

and enjoy your new smf forum :P

boy thats a lot to explain. not a lot to do, once you do it, its easy and fast to do</description>

<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Please note:</span></span><span class="bbcode-u"> this is just a tutorial how to setup smf forums free and still edit anything if you need.</span></p>
<p>first of you will need a ftp client, i recommend filezilla because its easy, it works and its free.</p>
<p>so go to <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/download.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://filezilla-project.org/download.php</a> and download it from there.</p>
<p>next you will need the simple machines forum source (smf stands for simple machines forum),</p>
<p>so go to <a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/download/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.simplemachines.org/download/</a> and download the FULL version, the others are older versions.</p>
<p>and last but not least the host to host it on the web for you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> now this is when it gets harder, i always have trouble anywhere els except hostwq its easy, it has it and its cheap. it supply’s all a web designer needs. (i think)</p>
<p>now go to <a href="http://www.hostwq.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.hostwq.net/</a> and click free hosting and sign up for it. (click paid hosting for your own .com .net .org ect. if you prefer to pay)</p>
<p>it will email you to activate your account so make sure you have gave it the right email address, now after you activate your account go login, witch is hard to find your first time, here’s a picture were it is:</p>
<p><img src="http://i196.photobucket.com/albums/aa56/billyboy385/loginpicture.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>now, if you don’t know your user name and password look at the email they sent you, this has all the info you will need too so keep that page up.</p>
<p>after you log on you will need to create a sql database <span class="bbcode-u">on</span> your host so click on mysQl manager and create a database BUT remember! only put like one word such as smf, forum, or anything you want but keep it one word.</p>
<p>now remember the database name (its your username with _DATABASENAMEHERE at the end)</p>
<p>after you’ve done this give yourself a treat lol it gets easier from now on end almost</p>
<p>now before you begin uploading files with your ftp client (filezilla) you should rename your smf source to whatever you want it to be after <a href="http://NAMEHERE.hostwq.net/SMFSOURCENAME" rel="nofollow noopener">NAMEHERE.hostwq.net/SMFSOURCENAME</a></p>
<p>so be careful</p>
<p>next, (the hardest part)</p>
<p>you need to upload the source with filezilla</p>
<p>so  Double click on your FileZilla icon from your desktop. Once you have done so, you should see the following:</p>
<p><img src="http://nfsupportdownloads.netfirms.com/graphics/filezilla.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Select File and then Site Manager.</p>
<p><img src="http://nfsupportdownloads.netfirms.com/graphics/filezilla1.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Select New Site and name it to what you would like.</p>
<p>Once completed, please enter your the following information: (you can get it all from that email i have told you to save)</p>
<pre><code>* hostname: ftp.hostwq.net
* port: leave it the way it is
* servertype: leave it the way it is
* logontype: normal
* userid: 
* password: your ftp account information
</code></pre>
<p>Click connect, You are now connected!</p>
<p>ok, the right side is the website stuff, the left is the stuff on your computer, locate the smf source on the left side and now on the right side double click the name of your website and then you should see htdocs folder, now click and hold your mouse over the smf source folder and move and let of the clicker on the htdocs folder and it should start to upload, it will take like 5 minutes around</p>
<p>once its uploaded go to <a href="http://WEBSITENAMEHERE.hostwq.net/SMFSOURCENAMEHERE/install.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://WEBSITENAMEHERE.hostwq.net/SMFSOURCENAMEHERE/install.php</a> and you can install it with the mysql settings:</p>
<p>MySQL server name: <span class="bbcode-b"><a href="http://sql2.hostwq.net" rel="nofollow noopener">sql2.hostwq.net</a></span></p>
<p>MySQL username: <span class="bbcode-b">youruserid</span></p>
<p>MySQL password: <span class="bbcode-b">your password</span></p>
<p>MySQL database name: <span class="bbcode-b">the name of your database you made</span></p>
<p>MySQL table prefix: <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">just leave it the way it is</span></span></p>
<p>now that thats done (guessing there’s no errors) you can install the easy little thing from there, after words, go to <a href="http://WEBSITENAME.hostwq.net/NAMEOFSOURCE/index.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://WEBSITENAME.hostwq.net/NAMEOFSOURCE/index.php</a></p>
<p>and enjoy your new smf forum <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>boy thats a lot to explain. not a lot to do, once you do it, its easy and fast to do</p>
