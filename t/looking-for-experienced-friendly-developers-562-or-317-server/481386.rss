<p>The really funny is you can’t understand what I writed above. Possibly a 12 years old have more experience, but I looking for normal peoples, who know many about the server creating. NO KIDS, TROLLS, RETARDS, are you understand me? I don’t really care how old are my partners, but to be sure, I need half-overgrown or overgrown persons. There is no chance to fail. And yes, you’re right. The Mopar, Rune Locus, and maybe the Rune-Server too, include a lot trolls… Well, goodbye then, good luck with trolling and destroy your life in this forum. If you think you’re the best cause you always trolling, then you already failed.</p>

<p>If you fully read the description, I looking for (if it’s possible) overgrown or REALLY normal persons, not trolls, kids, retards etc. Show me a kid who can act like a friendly person, and know everything… That’s why I looking for 17 year+ persons, they’re mostly trusted.</p>

<p>I don’t care the Jagex. I will create a better RuneScape than the Jagex, because my goal is not getting money, and I will look for what the players need. They ruined one game, and that was enough, time to make everything good, and I know the way to succeed with that… My goal is give the players the best game, also release some other (new) features, which will be a new style of pk/pvp.</p>
