    <title>RevengePK&#39;s RSPS History</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/revengepks-rsps-history/539002</link>
    <description>I was reading through all of the ones others have posted and they were really interesting, so I decided I&#39;d let everyone know a little about my history. :D

Soooooo, I started playing RSPS in about 2010 and didn&#39;t join MSCP until 2011. The first server I ever played was a server called &quot;Pk-Era&quot;. I can&#39;t find any screenshots of it but I did find a very poorly editted PK video. I think it was this day that I started playing RSPS that I lost all interest in RuneScape. (I was about 18 when I started playing RSPS).

From there I started playing a server called &quot;ZigiScape&quot; that I later worked my way from moderator to owning the server. (Main owner, not co-owner) This server achieved about 200 players online. Below is a video of that server.

ZigiScape soon shutdown because I didn&#39;t know what I was doing (I still don&#39;t.) From there I started my first &quot;Real&quot; server which was named &quot;Divinex&quot; which ultimately failed an got a max of about 30 onlines, from there I started the server &quot;RevengePK&quot; which also failed but got about 100 online. After that I went go into Web Design and started releasing simple TOS pages on MoparScape for people to use on their sites. This was kind of a hit, people used my stuff, but nothing big so I decided to start another server called &quot;ForgivenX&quot;. This server was online for about a year and fluctuated a player base of about 50 online to 300 online at times. Ultimately the server went offline due to a paypal debt of $500-+ (chargebacks). From there I decided I was really done with RSPS, I lost money, I love the communities that come with owning an RSPS but the money losses out weighed that. It was this moment that I decided to touch back on Web development. 

I started RSPSDesigns sometime in 2012 and started making website templates and released them for free. It was a hit kind of but really didn&#39;t take off so I shut it down for awhile. In early/mid 2013 I decided to open RSPSDesigns back up and amounted probably a total collective count of members and posts of 10k posts and 1k-+ members, but due to database problems and me just messing things up I lost most data and hit some bumps in the road. Once I got RSPSDesigns stable (late 2013) it was getting 400 uniques a day, many downloads, but absolutely no income, no donations, no thanks, just spam from kids just leeching the templates. So coming into 2014 I&#39;ve taken down RSPSDesigns again and I don&#39;t think I will be opening it. My templates still float around the RSPS communities but you will most likely not see my name on them because people have stolen my work.

Atleast I made a name for myself. :D

From there I think I&#39;m done with RSPS as a whole but I won&#39;t leave MoparScape because I like the community although my activity is not that high.</description>

              <p>Now that I look at zigiscape, it wasn’t that great of a server, but it sure has tons of memories good and bad.
