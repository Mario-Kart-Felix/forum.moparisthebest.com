    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/attack-anyone-anywhere-how-to-do-this/159790</link>
    <description>well, i made a topicx like this a week ago, but no one really helped me out, and i was just wondering how to make it so i can attack anyone anywhere, but only witha specific weopon, like, lets say the dragon 2 hander. I am using the fr33sc4p3 source, if that helps. Ty. Also type in the code for me and tell me where to put it.
