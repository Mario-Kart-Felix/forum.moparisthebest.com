              <p>look for the method called isinwild and you’ll see coords… with a bunch of ll absx absy blah blah ll then more coords here ll then more coords here… etc… the little bars separate the coords… make 2 bars… and add the coords of where u want ur wild to be. ur gona have 2 noclip, to find out how far over to the left, and right(x axis) and high and low (y axis) u gotta put… if u go in, and it doesnt work… change the coords. for example… you have absx &gt;=400 absx &lt;=300… and it dont work, change the first one to 300, and the second one to 400. it happened to me… then save and compile. make a copy of the client.java first, and put it on ur desktop so if u mess up u can replace. dont give up easy. and btw, its the first type of wildy, not the second… itll b like…<br>
METHOD HERE-BLAH BLAH<br>
BLAH BLAH<br>
TYPE == 1 BLAH BLAH<br>
BLAH BLAH<br>
TYPE == 2 BLAH BLAH</p>
<p>BLAH BLAH BLAH… its under type 1. GL=]</p>
