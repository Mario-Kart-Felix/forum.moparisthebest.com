    <description>Why did I get banned?

I understand my brother griefed but I can not control his actions. And to make up for what he did I walked
all the way to the city he griefed and used my own supplies to fix as much damage as I could. See, this is why I quit the last time. This server is full of immature children, I know it&#39;s a game but for the love of god, grow up.

I have done nothing but befriended other players, build and try to help out whoever I can, but some people on this
server think Minecraft is a place to act E-Hard and raid your allies and destroy the work you put into building things.

The only two reports against me are below:
• Where I broke some Lapis Lutzi; I apologize. Vizard told me it wasn&#39;t allowed and I stopped.
• Where  I placed cobblestone by lava; I was trying to stop the lava flow..</description>
