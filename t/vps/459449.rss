    <title>Vps?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vps/459449</link>
    <description>Hi, I read the topic - http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,474981.0.html before posting. What it didn&#39;t tell me on that topic was the specs I needed to have in order to host a lot of players on my server. 

There&#39;s things like:

[code]Storage
Bandwidth
Memory
Disk Space
CPU
RAM
VSwap
CPU Core
Uplink[/code]

So what are the main things in the code to look for, that will be able to hold a lot of players? And what else is good to look for in a VPS?</description>

Your 100% WRONG! They use the paypal money to support the server and buy advertisements/vps payments/domain payments.</p>
<p>No one spends there money to provide a server like that? You pay let’s say what 10-25 dollars monthly for domain name itself. Then most servers use Vbulletin which cost roughly 300 dollars, look it up. Or IpBoard.</p>
<p>Vps = 20-40 Dollars for a decent one if your hosting a 1k player server like near reality and soulsplit your vps price is going to increase. It’s common sense.<br>

You’re quite ignorant.  He wasn’t complaining that the servers accept donations, but rather how a majority of the updates and listed features are for donors.  Also here’s a more efficient cost guide that’s typically used more:</p>
<p>Cheap Webhost with domain name:  About $10 a month Source: <a href="http://www.bluehost.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Bluehost</a><br>
Small Vps with 3GB Ram, 3GHZ Procsesser:  About $40 a month Source: <a href="http://www.dotblock.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Dotblock Hosting</a><br>
SMF or Nulled VB/IPB Forum system:  $0 Source: <a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Simplemachines</a><br>
Advertisement on Server status page of multiple websites: $0  (Can’t link the source here, surely you can’t find them on your own)<br>
In total: We’re spending about $50 a month or $600 annually to host our server and website, meaning (lets say donator status costs $15) you only need 4 people to donate a month to meet hosting needs, witch is easy even on a really basic system, that’s not to mention if you allow the players to donate for items.</p>
<p>This goes for pretty much anyone else who’s saying “but my serba has a 12 gb vbs thats 24/7 and spends loads of money even tho theres only 20 players online”, it’s unneeded and unnecessary, not to mention probably untrue.[/quote]</p>

              <p>It is really hard to determine hosting capabilities based on the amount of players; however, if you are looking forward to hosting a server with a lot of players, you should probably look into dedicated servers.</p>
