Anyway copy your source across to your vps using filezilla and then download java and everything on vps, then run source and go to <a href="http://whatismyip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">whatismyip.org</a> and copy the ip and paste into your client.java or wherever ip is located, you are then free to close page and shut down pc anytime![/quote]</p>
<p>^^ don’t do that, if you would like to connect up your vps to your computer so that what u edit on your PC will transfer automatically to vps i can show you exactly how to just follow these simple steps.</p>
<p>1 - open up your vps, “if you now how to” if you do not simply grab the “IP” address they emailed you and the password, go to start and open “REMOTE DESKTOP CONNECTION” etc u can find a guide on that if you look hard enough.</p>
<p>2 - Download JDK1_7_0_07 <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7u7-downloads-1836413.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7u7-downloads-1836413.html</a> on both vps/computer</p>
<p>3 - Upload your source to dropbox, if you haven’t used it before take note of this, when you drag something into dropbox it automatically saves and transfers to your linked vps, but the only thing is, is knowing when it has completely transferred, and to know that look at the dropbox icon in your tools section bottom right of screen, if its a blue refresh icon means its still uploading, if its a green tick icon it means your good to go <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>4 - i definitely recommend using eclipse to Develop your server in, as its so much cleaner/organized and much more easier to use.</p>
<p>i hope this helped you.[/quote]</p>
<p>Kid. That’s what i exactly said.</p>
