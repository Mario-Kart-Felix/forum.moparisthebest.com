    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/criticism-needed/37442</link>
    <description>Hi.   :D

I would like to be a writer someday, and I recently completed a short story called [b]USEC[/b]. 

I want to know how I can improve, so I&#39;m submitting this short story to you in hopes I can get some useful criticism from some of the people I respect most. I&#39;m trying to write stories that are fun to read and suspenseful, so tell me what worked and what didn&#39;t, what you liked and what you hated, or whatever!</description>

<p>Actually, if you look through my posts on these forums, I once posted all night on here while I was tripping on acid, and I wrote a mini novella of sorts across the board in dozens of topics (if you look in "Recent posts by PaulT it’s posts 472-482 (page 24-25)…It makes a lot less sense now, and I deleted some of it the morning after).</p>
<p>It doesn’t really make any sense to me at all anymore actually…lol</p>

<p>Thanks for the compliments on the short story. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Hopefully I will improve at editing as well as writing thanks to PD’s help.

<p>I can imagine great stories from you, PaulT. Somehow you seem the type of guy that would write a story full of mystery, but after a while all the pieces add up. Let us know if you write any books <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I’ll read your story sometime soon, and tell you what I thought of it. I can’t help with the structure of it, but you have my support <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Btw, I got a suggestion that I think you could easily pull off. A story about an acid trip, but don’t mention anything about drugs. Just let the puzzle all come together, and the reader will figure it out.</p>
<p>edit: Just an update, already read through a lot. Paul I love this. I love the deal how it’s all from the main characters point of view. I hate books, but this I am able to keep my attention on easily.  [br][size=1]Posted at: December 20, 2006, 07:39:09 PM[/size][hr]Just finished reading.</p>
<p>Drugs, Explosions, and an easy to follow storyline. I think you did a great job. Especially towards the end, when they start making explosives, that kind of dragged me right into the story.</p>

              <p>Wow Philodespotos, you have helped me more than I imagined anybody could have. Thank you so much for your general tips  , the editing, and the offer. I’m going to take a good hard look at everything you suggested, make some changes to make it a more solid piece of writing. I understand what you mean about trimming the fat and the repeated words and phrases. :o <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I’m also really thankful that you tempered some of  your harsher criticism (though I did ask for it straight :P). I am quite an ametuer writer. Well, you only get better by writing more, and I suppose you only get better at editing by editing more, as well.</p>
<p>I’m really exciting about my next short story, I feel better prepared for the editing process this time around (my entire editing process for written works up into this point in my life has been to read through it once, and if I don’t see anything terrible mispelled I just go with it).</p>
<p>Thanks again for all your help.</p>

              <p>It was good. Pat yourself on the back, and indulge in congratulatory orange sounds if that’s your thing. What follows is advice from someone who writes obsessively every bloody day.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is cement your editing process. To do so is tedious, typically boring, and doesn’t immediately bear any fruit. But it makes the thousands of times you will repeat it much less cumbersome. I haven’t the slightest what a professional editor does, and don’t much care. My process is: a slow reading for misspellings, grammar, punctuation; a second reading and some chickenscratch to eliminate the most egregious of my 900 word sentences that amount to “the grass is green;” throw everything away and rewrite the entirety in very broad strokes – what do I actually consider important enough <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> to discard? – 50 pages can typically best be written in 5; with that in mind, go back and trim the fat from the original; now that I’ve got a product that doesn’t make me want to throw in the towel, note what words/tenses/phrases/constructions I’m overusing, and, rather than search for synonyms, get some new fuckin imagery. If I’m repeating the same words in a thousand spots, I need better ideas. This is just generic editing, without any significant changes to content.</p>
<p>I have made only a couple comments on content in my marginscrawling. Mostly, I’ve confined myself to the first two steps. The compliments are genuine; the insults largely suppressed. No need to seem like an ass right out of the box. I’ve also gone easy on punctuation, because it’s so tightly tied to style – as anyone who reads my posts can see, I overpunctuate, but productively. Others underpunctuate, but smoothly. Some follow the prescribed usage. They should be shot.</p>
<p>After many years of effort, it’s been decided that there’s no reasonable way of expressing editing changes without being able to scribble idly, so I’ve done it in the same manner that my friends and I use for each other: print, belittle, spill coffee, dry, scan. My handwriting is a toss up, depending on how early I started drinking. If you can’t read something, you’ll have to ask, or guess.</p>
<p>Anyhow – I do this quite literally every single day, whether with my works or a friend’s. Perfectly happy to look at yours, too, if you’d like. Just email it if you want it read in something approaching a timely fashion. me at gmail.</p>
<p><a href="http://benthos.eggsampler.com/pages.tgz" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://benthos.eggsampler.com/pages.tgz</a> – ca. 11mb, scanned printouts with the notes.</p>

[br][size=1]Posted at: December 20, 2006, 03:42:10 PM[/size][hr]Ok, heres some idea’s and points i thought i’d give.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Point one : </span></span><br>
Too many connectives causing uneeded breaks. At a part of suspense it really should flow, breaking it up lowers suspence a bit, however adding certain pauses can increase it. For example :</p>
<p>One with too connectives :</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">He came in the house and then he took out a knife and i knew he was going to kill me because i had something he wanted.</code></pre>
<p>One which would more flow :</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">He came into the house, took out a knife. He was going to kill me. I had something he wanted.</code></pre>
<p>I had a look at your third paragraph and this is where it becamse evident to me. It would go really smooth and i’d be like w00t im getting into this lets read on. Then it breaks, and it was annoying since i just wanted to read on instead of being…stopped?</p>

The name Christopher comes from the name Christ somehow, but nobody looked less like Jesus than Chris. First impressions must imprint visually on your brain, because every time I think of Chris I see him standing in the rain on the pavement of our schools parking lot, his black Batman rain jacket hung over him like a cloak, his head down. I see this dark aura around him, surrounding him and deflecting light, keeping him warm and safe. I walked over to him and said hi. </code></p>

<p>This is just of course my kinda opinion, some might prefer alot of connectives and find them uh…scarier?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Point 2 : </span></span><br>
A change in certain words to add more expression and emotion. For example :</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">I walked over to him and said hi. </code></pre>
<p>Could be replaced with something like :</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">I edged over to him </code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Point 3 : </span></span><br>
Repitition, like you so rightly said. The reader needs to fill in the blanks.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">I walked over to him and said hi.</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Hi was the word that exited my mouth</code></pre>
<p>You could combine the two sentences or just remove a section of once completly to avoid repitition like :</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">I walked over to him, the only word that managed to escape my mouth was Hi.</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">I walked over to him. Hi was the word that exited my mouth.</code></pre>
<p>This would be critism that i could only find on the first page. After the story gets going its really, really good. Good job <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>The eventual edit I made to the superflous beggining paragraph was:</p>

I will calmly wait until the inside of my body collapses into itself and I will have the peace I have dreamed for all my life. But until that happy moment, I can start to tell you my story. When I’m done or when the story’s finished, whichever comes first, you can fill in the blanks yourself. It’s not hard, you’ve been doing it already without realizing it.</blockquote>
<p>But your suggested pretty much pwns for overall simplicity+suspense, Taois. But I can’t use it, I don’t want to have to send you a check when I get published :P. Speaking of which, Impsoft better start sending you some royalties or someshit.</p>

<p>I would like to be a writer someday, and I recently completed a short story called <span class="bbcode-b">USEC</span>.</p>
<p>I want to know how I can improve, so I’m submitting this short story to you in hopes I can get some useful criticism from some of the people I respect most. I’m trying to write stories that are fun to read and suspenseful, so tell me what worked and what didn’t, what you liked and what you hated, or whatever!</p>
