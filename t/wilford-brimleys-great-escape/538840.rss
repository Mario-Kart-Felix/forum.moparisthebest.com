    <title>Wilford Brimley&#39;s Great Escape!</title>

    <description>Hello fellow Moparians! I am writing today to introduce you to my work in progress, Wilford Brimley&#39;s Great Escape! (Name pending)

First, to start off with some luxurious photo&#39;s!

Not very graphically stunning as of yet, the tileset is just some image I found from google, so that is a work in progress.

The game is eventually going to be based in a hospital, after Wilford wakes up from a diabetic coma the doctors tell him that they will not furnish him any sweets. This enrages Wilford so he jumps out of his hospital bed to attack the doctor with his fierce punching.

The goal of the game is to escape the hospital so he can get back home to devour his collection of sweets.
Your health will be syringes of insulin you find around the hospital, and devouring the scarce sweets that you find will fill your &quot;Diabetic rage&quot; meter. Activating the diabetic rage will allow Wilford to move faster and apply more damage to enemies. 

Doctors, nurses, security guards and pretty much all hospital staff will become an enemy and you will have to punch them to death in order to proceed through the game.
The game is programmed in Java and is being developed for Desktops and Android, using the LibGDX libraries.

Features that have been implemented:

[ul][li]8 direction movement[/li]
[li]Collision detection[/li]
[li]Camera following Wilford[/li]
[li]Tile map system, loads tile maps created with a program named &quot;Tiled&quot;[/li][/ul]


The game is very early on as I started working on it 2 days ago with my friend who is doing all the graphic elements.

I am currently working on the controls for the android devices, and character animations. I will post progress as it comes.</description>

              <p>LibGDX handels most of the tile mapping. <a href="https://code.google.com/p/libgdx-users/wiki/TiledMaps" rel="nofollow noopener">https://code.google.com/p/libgdx-users/wiki/TiledMaps</a></p>
<p>So I didn’t have much hand in that. I did collision detection by adding properties to certain tiles in the Tiled editor. I would then have Wilford iterate through the tiles surrounding him to check the tile properties and see if he should be able walk through them or not. I can post a better example when I get home.</p>
