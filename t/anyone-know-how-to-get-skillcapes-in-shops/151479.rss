    <description>Anyone know how to get skillcapes in shops? I wanted to know because when you get a 99 stat in my server (combat only) you get a skillcape but if you try and do it with other skills they don&#39;t appear.. So, I was wondering does anyone know how to make able to be bought in shops (Can&#39;t sell back) and price would be 1 gp ea
