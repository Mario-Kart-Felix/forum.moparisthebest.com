<p>C is not object oriented, so it has no objects. Everything in C is based on manipulating raw memory and every data type of the language is meant to ease that process. Strings are usually stored in 2 ways, either as a length and an array of characters, or as an array of characters with a terminator (usually null/0). The C standard library expects the latter definition, where you sacrifice an extra character in the string and do not store any sort of length. This has many advantages and disadvantages, but it is a compact form and does not require passing a struct around, similar to what you would think of as an object in OOP languages.</p>
