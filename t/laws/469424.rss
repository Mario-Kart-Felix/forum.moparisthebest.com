</aside>
<p>well as previously stated, I’m for the legalisation of all drugs for a variety of reasons but most importantly because it allows people to get the help they need, there’s a bigger discussion to be had on this topic but to keep it succinct: legalising drugs reduces the numbers of drug users, fatalities and drug-related crimes, it has been proven time and time again with large case studies such as those in portugal and the netherlands to name a couple</p>
<p>even if we ignore everything else, by looking for people on welfare who may have drug problems you’re demonising the most vulnerable people in society, I don’t quite see what you hope to achieve by making a bad situation even worse and thinking everything will turn out for the best</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>to understand why drug testing isn’t effective you need to look at the methodology of how drugs are tested, as I’ve stated many drugs don’t stay in your system for a long time and to find these drugs you actively need to search for them (costing money for resources and many, MANY man hours)</p>
<p>codeine, ghb, heroin, many opiates and oxycodone all stay in your system for as little as 1-2 days, meanwhile amphetamines, cocaine, ketamine and methamphetamine all stay in your system for up to 4 days, benzodiazepines only stay in your system for 3 days while lsd and ecstasy stay in your system for up to 5 days</p>
<p>so, in as little as 5 days, most of the drugs taken recreationally will be out of your system, it’s only a few other drugs that last longer such as cannabis, methadone and phencyclidine that generally stay in your system for longer than a week, so while we can test for those substances and find them if they were taken less than a week ago, you can’t actively search for those drugs unless you do random drug tests on a frequent basis and even then you’re looking at a good lot of the population who aren’t going to be caught by these tests unless you ramp up the tests, so to find a most likely minority of welfare recipients who take drugs you are now subjecting all welfare recipients to frequent drug tests where false positives may occur and if the welfare recipient can’t make a test (people on welfare have lives too you know) then they’d be suspected for taking drugs and possibility lose their only financial support</p>
<p>and what exactly will be caused by spending millions monthly testing all welfare recipients for drugs? you stop what is likely a small minority of people taking drugs and instead of saving money by stopping their welfare, you now send them to jail where they are almost CERTAINLY going to cost the system tens and hundreds of times MORE in financial costs than if they had spent their welfare money on drugs, and if these people have children you now have to spend money for childcare for them which again is only going to make a bad situation much worse</p>
<p>so for a tl;dr: to “save” money where welfare recipients spend it on drugs, you would have to spend millions on drug testing, millions on sending them to already overpopulated prisons and millions on childcare, and you’ll have to spend millions more on rehab and millions more making sure they don’t resort back to drug use, the guise that this saves money is often stated as a case by people who are opposed to welfare to begin with, not exactly an unbiased source</p>

</aside>
<p>drug testing is ridiculously ineffective, the only drugs that are detected are drugs that are being tested for and in many cases the drug will no longer be present in your system after 4 days, most drugs are gone in a week and detoxing may or may not reduce the time that the drugs in your system, it’s only certain drugs such as cannabis under HEAVY usage that the drug stays in the system for more like a month, and given that cannabis is starting to be legalised in several states that isn’t an issue</p>
<p>so, given that we now know that a) drug testing is expensive (commercial testing is $25 a pop, and like I say these kits only detect what they actually search for) and b) not always effective unless used frequently (for some drugs, every 3 days, others every 9 days) you’ll be spending a love LOAD per person to make sure they remain drug free for the purpose of “saving money”, you’ll end up wasting more money on drug tests than these people spend on drugs, not to mention the fact that the whole idea that welfare users are a bunch of moochers and druggies is completely baseless</p>

I would legalize everything in it weak normal forms, and compete out organized crime.  Make laws about drugs the same way you make laws again alcohol. You wouldn’t check if welfare recipients drink alcohol? If so, good look with your daily testing of everyone on welfare.</p>

Legalize drugs. Simply make it legal so it is safer and cheaper. Then they don’t have to waste too much money to get it. Don’t care about welfare recipients being on narcotics.</p>

STOP TAXES ALTOGETHER, THEY BAD, THEY COST MUNNEY</p>
<p>No but seriously, I don’t think you understand how fragile an economy is. Why do you think just a few years of bad budgeting has put us $16T in debt? It doesn’t really matter though, as long as the rest of the world believes we can pay off our debt. Once they start believing we can’t pay it off… Well, then we have a serious problem on our hands.</p>

I’m usually like “I WILL LEAVE 4 CANS FOR TOMORROW” then about 15 mins later I’m like “I WILL BE FINE WITH 3 CANS” and so forth, lol. I end up going to the supermarket and getting a 12 crate and that suits me fine. It’d be easier just going down the street though.</p>
