He thought we could get it cheaper from Canada, but if we did that, then our pharmaceutical businesses would raise the prices when selling to Canada which would raise the prices of Canada selling back to us which would be ridiculous!</p>
<p>If I had to choose between re-electing Bush or electing Kerry, I’d vote Bush. The only reason so many people hate him is from the stories and editorials you hear on the news or read in the newspaper.</p>

<p>I admit that I didn’t agree with everything Kerry said, but I would rather have him as our president than a fascist traitor who’s grandfather supplied the Nazis in World War 2. If you don’t believe that, look up the history of the the Bush family. His grandfather was a merchant of war and I wouldn’t be surprised if he was a Nazi too.</p>
<p>So yes I would rather have Kerry as our president. Hell, I would rather have a chipmunk as our president. A chipmunk could do a better job than that dick head Bush.</p>

<p>Just like when the soldiers forced the poor, imprisoned Iraqis into sexual poses and then took pictures of them. Oh yeah, achieving a lot there. :rolleyes: I get your point though, they want a feeling of achievement even though they are not helping at all.</p>

when signing up for a military thing, they tell you for signing up, you may be called for the line of duty, thats one of the things the soldeirs know when they sign up…  in the act of war or anything they know what there signing up for, bush isnt killing them, they joined knowing the consecuences there might be.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Got rich off the iraq war since his whole family is in oil and oil prices skyrocketed so he made a killing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3000 - 3500 US soldiers killed and over 100,000 Iraqis. Think how you would feel if you brother got shot or something, wouldn’t you hate the US? Well that’s what happening, and that happened 100,000 times. We have just created over 500,000 terrorists since the average Iraqi families have contain 5 people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased the national deficit (the national debt which is over 5 trillion now). This was going down in Bill Clinton’s era and as soon as Bush came in, he fucked it all up and we owe so many countries money now. If we put all the money that went to the Iraq war, into colleges. We would all have FREE colleges and our communities would be flooded with doctors, lawyers, and other good professions. Instead, Americans died so ol’ bushy could make another billion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He created the “Patriot Act” which basically let Bush do whatever the fuck he wants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He recently (in the last week or 2) created a new act that lets the American Soldiers do whatever the fuck they want with prisoners which blatantly goes against the Geneva Convention. Bush has no morals at all!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Him and the Republicans devils created a new document which enabled RETROACTIVE laws! This is the WORST THING EVER! Let me explain. Retroactive laws are laws that will get you in trouble that haven’t even been made yet. Such as… If you stole a TV set and you went to jail for 5 years, and they made a law 50 years later saying anyone that steals will be a felony and not a misdemeanor, then you would go to jail for an ADITIONAL amount of years. Also… you could do something perfectly legal, and then they could make it illegal 50 years later, and then when you were 70 you would go to jail for it. Does that even make fucking sense?? So lets see… I should somehow go to the future, understand all the new retroactive laws, just so I could come back to the present and not get fucked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recorded all phone conversations. To George Bush, the Constitution is nothing but Toilet paper, because Bush has shat on it so many times, he just doesn’t care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People protested outside of his ranch which is prefectly legal, and he created a new law that would send people to jail if they did that. Where is the freedom of speech??? Before you could protest any where as long as it was non violent. It’s like I just woke up one morning and I saw the Nazi Party walking all over the US. WHAT THE FUCK. Didn’t we fight a war against fascism? Aren’t we ‘anti communist’??</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When Hugo Chavez (president of Venezuela) walked into the UN building and called Bush “the Devil” I totally agreed with him. I can’t fuckin believe the people of this nation voted him in after all the shit he pulled!</p>
<p>The above is just the things at the top of my head. There are so many other things he has done that the Average Joe Blow American doesn’t even realize.</p>
