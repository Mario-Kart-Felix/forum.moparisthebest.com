    <title>Your experience with Android vs equivalent Windows Phone 8 / iOS apps?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/your-experience-with-android-vs-equivalent-windows-phone-8-ios-apps/541909</link>
    <description>Recently bought Nexus 5, was also considering some top Lumia. Planning to make some apps maybe, with a C++ backend of course.

What&#39;s your experience with Android vs equivalent Windows Phone 8 / iOS apps? Do the latter two tend to perform faster? Some iOS developers at my company claimed that the same Android front-ends perform slower (usually whenever the company writes an app there will be a version for every platform). Maybe the Android developers were just bad, not sure.</description>

<p>Alright. Anyway, the problems were on the Java side. I have actually written some core components in C++ that are used for all the mobile frontends, and that performs very fast on Android.</p>
