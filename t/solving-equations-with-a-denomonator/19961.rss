    <title>Solving equations with a denomonator</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solving-equations-with-a-denomonator/19961</link>
    <description>I was just wondering how to go about solving equations with a denomonator.. like the steps to doing it. Here is an example question.

3
- x = 15
4

My teacher gave us some messed up notes, and this is what they say (it&#39;s a handout.)

1. Rewrite the equation by getting rid of any brackets first.
2. Get rid of denomonators by doing one of two things:
a) If there&#39;s a term on each side of the &#39;=&#39; then cross multiply.
b) If there&#39;s more than one term on a side, find common denomonator for all the terms in equation.
3. Solve as normal.


So I don&#39;t know what one of the two to do, because finding the greatest common demonator will keep it as a fraction? :confused: And if I cross multiply a fraction with a number thats messed up. Sorry if you think I&#39;m an idiot I just think our teacher should give better explination in her notes.  :o</description>

              <p>Well, Calc isn’t really difficult…its just something new.  But calc requires <span class="bbcode-b">a lot</span> of algebra knowledge, and I have to agree with my teacher’s statement at the start of my last calc class…that you don’t really learn algebra fully until you do calculus.</p>

              <p>Wouldn’t cross multiple and the common denominater be the same in this case? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>This is so easy. Just wait till you get Calculus. :rolleyes: (I’m so happy, I got a 95% on my precalc quiz!!! :D)</p>

              <p>To solve that, you can understand it to be a fraction multiplying x, and then multiply each side by the fraction’s reciprocal.  The reciprocal of a fraction of simlpy the denominator and numerator switched, and therefore is 4/3.</p>
<p>Multilpying 3/4 with 4/3 gives you 12/12 or 1 and multiplying 15 by 4/3 gives you 60/3 or 20.  So 20’s your answer.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can actually view it is a rational equation, which I guess is what your teacher wanted (I prefer the first way).  Ie (3x)/4 = 15.  In this case, to solve it, multiply each side by 4 to give you 3x = 60.  Then divide by 3, giving you x = 20.</p>
