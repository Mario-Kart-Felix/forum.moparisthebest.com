    <title>My server in the making</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-server-in-the-making/400434</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, i&#39;m not sure if any of you remember me but I was here a while back with diagnostic-pk. Wasn&#39;t much of a server in fact it only had like 20 people on. But anyways, I am hoping to get back and be active on here and start a new server. This server is PI based and i&#39;m looking for a person/people to help me make it. The source is nividia I believe so a big thanks to whoever made that for the source and client. I&#39;m not really that good with all the java stuff and i&#39;m basically looking for people to help me learn and to help me with the server. I haven&#39;t really came up with a name for it yet but post back to this in this format:

Java knowledge: 1/10
MSN:
Would you like to help: yes/no

Thank you all of you that try to help.. And I do not know if this is in the right section I didn&#39;t really see one for it so if it is in the wrong section could a moderator please move it;)

Sincerely, Vexillum.</description>
