    <title>[PI] Door Issue (can&#39;t open already opened doors)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-door-issue-cant-open-already-opened-doors/521447</link>
    <description>I couldn&#39;t find anything about this, if there&#39;s already a fix please send me a link.

From what I understand if a person loads an area with a door opened, the door will be closed to them and be opened to the server. This means they can&#39;t open it because it is closed while it is opened, it also can&#39;t be closed because it is opened.

So the door is stuck in a closed state no matter what, unless someone who can see the opened door decides to shut it (not likely). This eventually leads to every door in the game being glitched until the server is restarted.

Is there a way to fix this?

Example:

Person A opens door - leaves the are
Person B tries to open door - for whatever reason the server thinks its closed and the door code says its opened - door cannot be opened
Person C was in the same area as Person A when the door was opened - door shows as open to him so he can open/close it as normal

I hope that explains it enough...</description>

It sounds like it’s only partial global.</p>
