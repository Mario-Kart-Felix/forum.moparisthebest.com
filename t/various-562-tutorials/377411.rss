    <description>1. Spawning an NPC.
2. Changing player rights.
3. Making NPC&#39;s yell.
4. Spawning objects.




1. Spawning an npc. First - you must find what ID the npc is. 
Usually in a 562 source, there is a file saying &quot;Lists&quot;, which has an NPC list in it, or. You can use this link http://www.mediafire.com/?mg9kyyn4cknjcxr, has all npcs. 
Right, now in your 562 source, go into the &quot;Data&quot; folder, and in here should be a &quot;Npcs&quot; xml file. Right click it and click &quot;edit&quot;.
Okay now there should be a code something along the lines of &lt;npc&gt;&lt;id&gt;6682&lt;/id&gt;&lt;location&gt;&lt;x&gt;2853&lt;/x&gt;&lt;y&gt;10192&lt;/y&gt;&lt;z&gt;0&lt;/z&gt;&lt;/location&gt;&lt;/npc&gt;. 
What this code is saying &quot;&lt;id&gt;6682&lt;/id&gt; is the ID of the npc, (6682 is Revenant Icefiend).
&lt;location&gt;&lt;x&gt;2853&lt;/x&gt; is the X coord which can be found in game by doing the ::coords/coords command.
&lt;y&gt;10192&lt;/y&gt; is the Y coord which is also found by ::coords/coords, &lt;z&gt;0&lt;/z&gt; is the height. 0 is on the ground, -1 is underground, and 1+ is above ground. 
&lt;/location&gt;&lt;/npc&gt; shows the end of the code. Now compile, re-run server and there will be a Revenant Icefiend spawned at coords: X2853, Y10192, Z0. 

2. Changing a players rights (Making Staff) - First, get the player&#39;s name. 
Okay, in the source, go into &quot;Data&quot; and then into &quot;Savedgames&quot;, and find the player&#39;s name. E.G &quot;Aaron&quot;
Now, rightclick on the Aaron.xml file and click &quot;Edit&quot;, and it should show up with something like &quot;&lt;player&gt;&lt;location&gt;&lt;x&gt;2964&lt;/x&gt;&lt;y&gt;3379&lt;/y&lt;z&gt;0&lt;/z&gt;&lt;/location&gt;, that sort of stuff.
Now, click ctrl+f to open search, or go into &quot;Edit&quot; on notepad, and select &quot;Find&quot;
Search for &quot;Rights&quot;, it will show up: &lt;rights&gt;0&lt;/rights&gt;.
All you have to do is change the number in the middle. 0 = Normal player. 1 = Moderator. 2 = Admin. 3 = Co-Owner. 4 = Owner
After you&#39;ve changed the number, save the file, restart server, and then they&#39;ll be the rights of your choosing.

3. Making npcs yell something when you click &#39;Talk&#39; on them
Okay, in your source, Search for NPCPacketHandler.
Once in there, search for private void optionHandle(final Player p, NPC npc) {
Under there, there should be a bunch of codes along the lines of
		
                        if(npc.getId() == 249) {
			npc.getUpdateFlags().setForceTextUpdateRequired(true);
			p.turnTo(npc);
			npc.forceChat(&quot;You Can Donate For Member For Just 2.50.&quot;);
		}

Okay, Let&#39;s say you want &quot;Hans&quot; to yell &quot;Hello server!&quot; when you click &#39;talk&#39; on him, what you want to do is add the code 
		if(npc.getId() == 0) {
			npc.forceChat(&quot;Hello Server!&quot;);
                }
The &quot;if(npc.getId() == 0) {&quot; states the npc&#39;s id, which for hans is 0.
The &quot;npc.forceChat(&quot;Hello Server!&quot;);&quot; states what the npc says. Which is &quot;Hello Server!&quot;
And the } states that it&#39;s the end of the code.
If you want a different npc to say something else, all you have to do is change the Npc ID to which npc you want, and the &quot;Hello Server&quot; part to what you want him to say.
Then save this file. Compile, restart server, Done. (Make sure you SPAWN the Npc first, like in my guide above)

4. Adding objects to your server
What you have to do is in your source, search for ActionSender.
When in there, search for &quot;World.getWorld().getObjectManager().refresh(player);&quot;
A few lines under there should be several codes along the lines of
			player.getActionSender().sendCreateObject(3443, 0, 2604, 5702, 1, 10);
			player.getActionSender().sendCreateObject(3443, 0, 2603, 5702, 1, 10);
			player.getActionSender().sendCreateObject(29959, 0, 2609, 5706, -1, 10);
What this code is saying is &quot;(3443,&quot; for what object ID it is.
The &quot;0,&quot; is the Z coord. (explained how to find in my guide above #1)
The &quot;2604,&quot; is the X coord. (explained how to find in my guide above #1)
The &quot;5702,&quot; is the Y coord. (explained how to find in my guide above #1)
The &quot;1,&quot; is the way it faces. I believe 1 is facing northwest, and -1 is facing southeast, I can&#39;t remember though
And &quot;10);&quot; is stating that the code is finished.
After that. Just compile, restart server, and your done!

<p>Spawning an npc. First - you must find what ID the npc is.<br>
Usually in a 562 source, there is a file saying “Lists”, which has an NPC list in it, or. You can use this link <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?mg9kyyn4cknjcxr" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mediafire.com/?mg9kyyn4cknjcxr</a>, has all npcs.<br>
Right, now in your 562 source, go into the “Data” folder, and in here should be a “Npcs” xml file. Right click it and click “edit”.<br>
Okay now there should be a code something along the lines of 66822853101920.<br>
What this code is saying "6682 is the ID of the npc, (6682 is Revenant Icefiend).<br>
2853 is the X coord which can be found in game by doing the ::coords/coords command.<br>
10192 is the Y coord which is also found by ::coords/coords, 0 is the height. 0 is on the ground, -1 is underground, and 1+ is above ground.<br>
 shows the end of the code. Now compile, re-run server and there will be a Revenant Icefiend spawned at coords: X2853, Y10192, Z0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing a players rights (Making Staff) - First, get the player’s name.<br>
Okay, in the source, go into “Data” and then into “Savedgames”, and find the player’s name. E.G “Aaron”<br>
Now, rightclick on the Aaron.xml file and click “Edit”, and it should show up with something like "29643379&lt;/y0, that sort of stuff.<br>
Now, click ctrl+f to open search, or go into “Edit” on notepad, and select “Find”<br>
Search for “Rights”, it will show up: 0.<br>
All you have to do is change the number in the middle. 0 = Normal player. 1 = Moderator. 2 = Admin. 3 = Co-Owner. 4 = Owner<br>
After you’ve changed the number, save the file, restart server, and then they’ll be the rights of your choosing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making npcs yell something when you click ‘Talk’ on them<br>
Okay, in your source, Search for NPCPacketHandler.<br>
Once in there, search for private void optionHandle(final Player p, NPC npc) {<br>
Under there, there should be a bunch of codes along the lines of</p>
<pre><code>                 if(npc.getId() == 249) {
 	npc.getUpdateFlags().setForceTextUpdateRequired(true);
 	p.turnTo(npc);
 	npc.forceChat("You Can Donate For Member For Just 2.50.");
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, Let’s say you want “Hans” to yell “Hello server!” when you click ‘talk’ on him, what you want to do is add the code<br>
if(npc.getId() == 0) {<br>
npc.forceChat(“Hello Server!”);<br>
}<br>
The “if(npc.getId() == 0) {” states the npc’s id, which for hans is 0.<br>
The “npc.forceChat(“Hello Server!”);” states what the npc says. Which is “Hello Server!”<br>
And the } states that it’s the end of the code.<br>
If you want a different npc to say something else, all you have to do is change the Npc ID to which npc you want, and the “Hello Server” part to what you want him to say.<br>
Then save this file. Compile, restart server, Done. (Make sure you SPAWN the Npc first, like in my guide above)</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Adding objects to your server<br>
What you have to do is in your source, search for ActionSender.<br>
When in there, search for “World.getWorld().getObjectManager().refresh(player);”<br>
A few lines under there should be several codes along the lines of<br>
player.getActionSender().sendCreateObject(3443, 0, 2604, 5702, 1, 10);<br>
player.getActionSender().sendCreateObject(3443, 0, 2603, 5702, 1, 10);<br>
player.getActionSender().sendCreateObject(29959, 0, 2609, 5706, -1, 10);<br>
What this code is saying is “(3443,” for what object ID it is.<br>
The “0,” is the Z coord. (explained how to find in my guide above <span class="hashtag">#1</span>)<br>
The “2604,” is the X coord. (explained how to find in my guide above <span class="hashtag">#1</span>)<br>
The “5702,” is the Y coord. (explained how to find in my guide above <span class="hashtag">#1</span>)<br>
The “1,” is the way it faces. I believe 1 is facing northwest, and -1 is facing southeast, I can’t remember though<br>
And “10);” is stating that the code is finished.<br>
After that. Just compile, restart server, and your done!</li>
