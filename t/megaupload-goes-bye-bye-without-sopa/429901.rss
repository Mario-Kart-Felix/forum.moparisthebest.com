    <title>Megaupload goes bye-bye without SOPA</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;MegaUpload, one of the largest file-sharing sites on the Internet, has been shut down by federal prosecutors in Virginia. The site’s founder Kim Dotcom and three others were arrested by the police in New Zealand at the request of US authorities. MegaVideo, the streaming site belonging to same company, and a total of 18 domains connected to the Mega company were seized and datacenters in three countries raided.

megauploadJust a few weeks ago, MegaUpload founder Kim Dotcom told TorrentFreak that his Mega ventures have nothing to worry about, as they operate within the rules of the law.

“Mega has nothing to fear. Our business is legitimate and protected by the DMCA and similar laws around the world. We work with the best lawyers and play by the rules.

“We take our legal obligations seriously. Mega’s war chest is full and we have strong supporters backing us,” Dotcom said.

But behind the scenes powerful forces were at work, plotting the forceful demise of MegaUpload, one of the world’s biggest websites.

An indictment unsealed today by the Department of Justice claims that MegaUpload has caused the entertainment industries more than $500 million in lost revenue and generated $175 million “in criminal proceeds.”

Two corporations – Megaupload Limited and Vestor Limited – were indicted by a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia on January 5th, 2012, and charged with “engaging in a racketeering conspiracy, conspiring to commit copyright infringement, conspiring to commit money laundering and two substantive counts of criminal copyright infringement.”

Today, the authorities executed in excess of 20 search warrants in the United States and eight other countries.

Data centers in the Netherlands, Canada and Washington housing MegaUpload’s equipment were raided. In an apparent reference to the latter location, a source has just informed TorrentFreak that the FBI are currently detaining everyone at the ISP Cogent Communications’ headquarters in Washington DC, in connection with a Mega-related search warrant.

In addition to MegaUpload founder Kim Dotcom who was arrested today in New Zealand, another six alleged members of the Mega “conspiracy” were charged in the indictment:

- Finn Batato, 38, Mega’s chief marketing officer and a citizen and resident of Germany
- Julius Bencko, 35, Mega’s graphic designer from Slovakia
- Sven Echternach, 39,Mega’s German head of business development;
- Mathias Ortmann, 40, the German CTO, co-founder and director of Mega
- Andrus Nomm, 32, programmer and head of the development from Estonia
- Bram van der Kolk, 29, a Dutch citizen who oversaw programming and network issues.

Dotcom, Batato, Ortmann and van der Kolk were arrested today in Auckland, New Zealand, by authorities there. Bencko, Echternach and Nomm are still at large.

The authorities seized approximately $50 million in assets, which appears to include Kim Dotcom’s treasured collection of several dozen cars, as detailed below.

A total of 18 Mega-related domains were also seized by authorities including Megastuff.co, Megaworld.com, Megaclicks.co, Megastuff.info, Megaclicks.org, Megaworld.mobi, Megastuff.org, Megaclick.us, Mageclick.com, HDmegaporn.com, Megavkdeo.com, Megaupload.com, Megaupload.org, Megarotic.com, Megaclick.com, Megavideo.com, Megavideoclips.com and Megaporn.com.

According to the Department of Justice, the individuals named in the indictment face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on the charge of conspiracy to commit racketeering, five years in prison on the charge of conspiracy to commit copyright infringement, 20 years in prison on the charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering and five years in prison on each of the substantive charges of criminal copyright infringement.

The legal action against Mega will set a precedent for similar cloud-hosting services. The MegaUpload site itself had no search function to discover content directly, but according to the indictment this was done to “conceal the scope of its infringement.” Would the same be true for services such as Dropbox?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<blockquote>The internet is up in arms over the federal crackdown of file-sharing website Megaupload, from irate blog posts to coordinated digital attacks on secure government servers. The move appeared to be a sort of governmental muscle flexing in the wake of the successful internet protest of SOPA and PIPA. But was there another reason? In the weeks before the crackdown, Megaupload was planning on launching a new music sharing website called Megabox that looked like it had the potential to completely transform music distribution, and even find a way to pay musicians in the process.
<p><span class="bbcode-b">From TorrentFreak, via Digital Music News:</span></p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>“UMG [Universal Music Group] knows that we are going to compete with them via our own music venture called <a href="http://Megabox.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Megabox.com</a>, a site that will soon allow artists to sell their creations directly to consumers while allowing artists to keep 90 percent of earnings,” said MegaUpload founder Kim dotcom.</p>
<p>“We have a solution called the Megakey that will allow artists to earn income from users who download music for free,” Dotcom said. “Yes that’s right, we will pay artists even for free downloads.  The Megakey business model has been tested with over a million users and it works.”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This smacks a little of conspiracy theory, but there may be some truth to the timing. MegaUpload no doubt looked like a good target for FBI attention even before this new development,  considering it was prime hacker territory and and its founder was living like a Colombian drug lord in New Zealand. But the timing seems a little serendipitous, especially since MegaUpload had even begun to acquire legitimate partners in the form of 7digital, Gracenote, Rovi and Amazon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>basically the music industry would have lost loads as artists could sell directly on megabox and get 90% of the money, unlike the 10% they receive now.</p>

<p>Nope, they all adhere to DMCA takedowns,  it is all to do with the rewarding of uploaders through reward schemes so far as I can tell. Hence why RapidShare is still here (after they abandoned reward poitns a few years ago). I could be wrong but it seems they are specifically targetting the ones that payout to uploaders.</p>
<p>Once the profit moves from selling server space and bandwidth to paying a user to upload illegal content the leverage in court is swiftly shifted to oppose what they do and its udnerstandable why, you shouldn’t be paid for every 1000 downloads of your illegally uploaded content.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>So i’ve done more and more reading on this today and tbh nobody really knows what the hell is going. Mostly just speculation and conspiracies regarding Megabox. Seems to me the rewards programme and the removal of links but nto content are the key factors here. (Although I’m told DMCA doesn’t require the removal of content :/)</p>

In the case of Megaupload they only removed the “symlink” to the content and did not actually delete it. This was done because if somebody other uploaded content that already was on the servers they were just given an unique link to that to save space on hard drives. So when a DCMA or whatever notice was given they just removed the link that was reported but kept the other links to the content intact.</p>

<p>To be honest, the whole idea of prosecuting (ab)users of the internet is something new to me. It’s been around for a while, but I haven’t given it much thought yet.

So if I murder someone in Germany and go back to the Netherlands, I get arrested by the Dutch police and I’m extradited to Germany.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It doesn’t need to involve travel - the idea is that if a crime has been committed in the country that wants the guy, they can try extradition. Doesn’t matter whether he was physically there or not. The conditions of the extradition depend on the treaties in place between the two nations, not any sort of overarching international extradition “law”.</p>
<p>For example, the US-UK extradition treaty allows for us to send criminals to the US if they commit a crime in the US, even if they were on UK soil at the time. This is what allowed the extradition of Gary McKinnon - he hacked into US government servers while living in the UK. What matters is a) Dual Criminality (the offence must be a crime in both countries, usually, not just the receiving country) and b) That we believe the accused will be treated fairly and not subject to cruel or unusual punishment, or a biased/politically motivated trial.</p>
<p>If MegaUpload had servers in the US, and NZ has a similar agreement with the US, then that is plenty to legally extradite them.</p>

<p>Cybercrime obviously is different, because usually there’s no traveling. But isn’t it true that when I violate copyright laws, I get prosecuted in my own nation? For instance, downloading anything from ThePirateBay is completely legal here in the Netherlands (as long as I use it myself, which makes torrents a bad example), so even if I download an American movie I should be safe. Mega is a big player, and obviously US prosecutors limit themselves (hopefully) to the big fish, but in theory this sets a precedent for cases involving every day citizens. Or am I missing something here?</p>

              <p>Stupid mistake by me.</p>
<p>What SOPA would do is to shut down sites without caring about what other government thinks. There is some limits to extraditions. In Norway for instance you can’t be extradition if you are a citizen, the action isn’t punishable with over 1 year  of prison, not enough evidence for the crime or the person is risking death penalty.</p>
<p>So without SOPA you would have to rely on other governments rules, with SOPA they can do whatever they want.</p>
