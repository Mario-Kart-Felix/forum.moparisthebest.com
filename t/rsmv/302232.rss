    <description>[b]Please note I didn&#39;t make RSMV, All I have done Is Upgraded It a bit, I only take credit for my upgrades[/b]

Hi,

Recently I downloaded the RSMV tool myself but decided that it needed a few modifications.
So I did the modifications and then decided that I would post it here for download.

(just incase people say it dosen&#39;t relate to server emulation, it can, we can use this to find models too add the clients :))
(For those of you who do not know, RSMV is used for downloading the Current Runescape Model Cache, The downloaded files are stored as .dat files which can be opened using a program called &#39;DatMaker1_33&#39;, a link can be found on SilentCJ&#39;s model tutorial, in that tutorial he also covers adding models to a client, Using DatMaker we can also extract the models into MQO files which can be converted the the popular 3d format 3DS by using a software called &#39;metaseq249&#39;)

[b]DOWNLOAD LINK[/b]

New Mods;
~When starting the model download you can define What to start on (So say i could have an empty model list and start downloading from like 30000)
~Variables are now gathered from text file (This is the download world, port and cache version) (You can edit them without having to compile again)

And I added some new files too;
~New compiler. I think this is posibly the best compiler out, the compiler uses a .exe file to store the JDK location (stored in registry) in a text file which is read by the compiler, this hopefully removes the need for ever having to have people mod your compilers to use their JDK.
I havent included the source for the .exe file because its my work and I don&#39;t want people stealing the creds.  :|



I was also going to try and modify the Model Viewer application to stop the repeating error messages by switch to the last working model but the source code to the .exe file was incomplete (file missing) so i couldn&#39;t.


Please do not flame. If you don&#39;t like it you don&#39;t like it.

It&#39;s in a .zip file, scan it yourself to be sure but this is 100% virus free.

Pleaes Enjoy and comment.
