    <description>Hello, thanks for checking out the minecraft adv thread for Project Marcbob. We are a small server with dedicated players looking to expand. We currently are survival/building type server. Anyone can play!

Also, I made it so [size=10pt][b]anyone can play[/b][/size]. That is right, if you have not bought minecraft you can still play!!! How? - Download the client right here: http://uppit.com/ekpzpqtnv84z/minecraft.jar
You can login with any username and password you would like to use. 

Every user when logging in for the first time will be presented with having to register your password. No one will know this.
To register for the first time do [b]/register [i]password[/i][/b]
Then, every time you come on you will have to login with that password by using [b]/login [i]password[/i][/b]
(obviously replace password with what you want your password to be)

Currently we do have block protection and chest protection.
-I am the only person who can block certain areas from being griefed. If you want me to protect your house or building creation just message me and I will.

[b]How to use chest protection[/b]:
/cprivate - Only you can access your chest
/cpublic - makes the chest public and prevents people from protecting it. Great for community areas.
/cpassword [i]password[/i] - requires users to use /cunlock [i]password[/i] and enter the correct password to access a chest.
(obviously replace password with what you want the password to be and what it is)
/cremove - removes protection from a chest.

[b]LIVE MAP OF THE SERVER: http://216.231.138.246:8123/

Server IP: 216.231.138.246:25576[/b]

[b]Get playing we are looking for active users to be mods![/b]</description>
