    <title>Project Marcbob</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-marcbob/448115</link>
    <description>Welcome to the Development Team thread for Project Marcbob. The current base we are looking to build off is Rune-Legacy. My past servers have all been very successful because of my advertising and marketing skills. I am hoping to have this be one of my best servers yet.

One of the things I have failed to do in my past servers is have a strong staff team to take some of the stress off myself and to create a better server. My last server hit 70+ online and I think I had one in game moderator and I was not on as much as I should have been at the time.

[b]Goals of the server:[/b]
[i]-Hit 150+ before the end of July.
-Become 100% user friendly.
-Average around 100 forum users online at the best times.
-No glitches and every skill trainable. (2 Left to do)
-Some custom bosses and items with custom attack styles.
-Great Staff team.
-Well thought out donation system and benefits.[/i]

Now about the positions I am looking to fill. 

[b]1. Website Developer[/b]: I only need one person who is very experienced for this. There are several things which I need done that are very basic, such as a homepage for the website. Also, I need some things that I am willing to pay for which are a Toplist, webclient maker with loaders, and integrated features which I will bring up with someone interested. I really am not willing to pay much for this and I really shouldn&#39;t even have to offer money for this position.

[b]2. 2006/2007 Remake developer[/b]: This is a 100% paid position and I am only looking to buy a nearly completed remake which will act as a world 2 or possibly a different server. I am only interested in good remakes. I&#39;m 99% sure I will never end up buying one.

[b]3. Project Marcbob server developer[/b]: I am looking for 1-2 server developers to help complete custom and original content. We are looking to have lots of original features that have never been seen before. 

[b][u][i]-Other information on positions: If you are looking to make money but can&#39;t do anything mentioned above please message me on MSN or on my website. I can give you other stuff to do.[/i][/u][/b]

[code]
Name:
Age:
What are you applying for?
Experience:
Do you have any special skills that relate to a RSPS?
Why should I choose you?[/code]

Thanks for reading and good luck to those who apply. My budget alone for the 2006/2007 remake is around $200 but obviously I won&#39;t pay that for just anything. I have been offered lots of servers but they have all been pretty bad.

[b][u]I am also looking to partner who is into running minecraft servers. I would love to have one be apart of the website.[/u][/b]</description>

<p>Because I knew you, the owner, wouldn’t have gave me any. There is no where on your thread that says to PM you for details. You only ask for people to apply. Not to test my skills. I’ll build a webpage with enough given details. As everyone is unique and I’m NOT going to know exactly what you like and how you want something styled.</p>

Can you please just keep your mod recruiting to your website? Just don’t even mention it in the OP… if you’re recruiting mods it should be people that are actually interested in the project so they registered anyways, not just people that are power hungry so they register for a staff position. Just please, there is no reason to even bring it up in the OP.<br>
