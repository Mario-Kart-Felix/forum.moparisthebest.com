    <description>
-My goal is to make a great economy server based on 718 Matrix and host it - Lot&#39;s of Bosses, skilling, minigames, and great pking. The pking that came with the source already is pretty amazing so I am not going to touch that. Some skills need some work and some minigames also do. I also plan on adding more bosses and dungeons.

-This server is going to be something I am going to learn off. No more taking short cuts and doing other random bullshit, I am going to learn. I&#39;m not going to rush the progress.

[b]The home[/b] - Edgeville - Why? I want a lot of pking on the server. That is almost what I am basing it off. Edge is a great home for active pking. I am always open to changing it, however.

[b]The Shops[/b] - Spread around home and I plan to put a couple at the doantor zone that will give them some kind of an advantage.

[b]The skilling[/b] - Every skill except farming is currently trainable. I took a shortcut with construction and did something very basic for a temporary solution. The rate of training is very fair for skilling and insanely fast for construction

[b]PvM[/b] - Currently there are a good amount of bosses and dungeons, but there could be more. I am adding more and more every day for new sources of money and good items.

[b]Minigames[/b] - Pretty much the only minigames done are the ones that came with the source. I need to work on that so there is more to do.

[b]PvP[/b] - As I mentioned already it is nearly perfect which is great because one of the focuses of this server is going to be pking. 

[b]What makes me a good owner?[/b] I have been running servers for a very long time now (just look at how long i&#39;ve been at MoparScape even) and I know what it takes to run and successful server and make players. This time I am even more dedicated because I want to get the server done right and I don&#39;t care how long it will take.

[b]Positions I need[/b] - This is the first server where I am actually going to have picked out my developers and staff members before hand. Obviously there will always be in-game promotions but I want to start with a couple people.
- I need 1-2 server developers, 1 website developer, and 1-3 moderators or server support.
- If you want one of these positions feel free to post in this topic. Pretty much just make up you own application. Include whatever you feel is necessary.

I guess I can add more pictures later for those who need pictures :P

I am really trying to be successful in this server. I am going to run the server for like a &quot;beta&quot; period to find what needs to be done in order to make gameplay, money making, bossing, skilling, and whatever else more smooth. In that time all the donations will build up and hopefully we will be able to buy a MoparScape sponsored spot and get a lot of players that way but I want to have a decent community before then.



[i]Just did lazy man construction to give people something to train[/i]

why should you pick me?: I can program most of the basics for you and also many of the more advanced stuff such as dungeoneering.<br>
My best work you could say is my construction base not flawless but approaching.<br>
I can’t come on 24/7 but more like for 1-2 hours for just coding and discussing what we need to do. You can tell from my prior knowledge what I’m capable of doing.</p>

Name: Jesse W.<br>
Age: 17<br>
Dedicated: Definitley, it’ll give me a lot more to do than just play real RuneScape (Which has gotten beyond boring)<br>
Time Available: I’d say a good 8 hours each day. Give or take 1 hour.<br>
Reason for Applying for this Position: I’ve seen your past work, and I believe this server can get somewhere. I’ll be multi-tasking (If accepted) on being a server support for you, and writing code for my project (I’m rather good at multi-tasking. It’s my life :P). I’ve also been known to rule with an iron fist, but not like a full on dictator, I listen, am respectful, and playful. I also can give you loads of ideas to add (I’d have to see what you got first.)<br>
Anything else you want to know? Feel free to ask me.</p>

              <p>You said you’re open to changing the home. I’ve got a simple suggestion for you:<br>
Why not make the users log in a neutral location on first login, from there, they would pick a hope. Edgeville for PK, or something like Cammy for Economy/Skill based home.<br>
Then have something like ::homeswitch, if they ever decide to use the opposite.</p>
