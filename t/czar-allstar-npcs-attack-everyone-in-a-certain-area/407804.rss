    <title>[czar/allstar]NPCs attack everyone in a certain area?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/czar-allstar-npcs-attack-everyone-in-a-certain-area/407804</link>
    <description>[b]Alright, first off, I realize it&#39;s &quot;czar/allstar&quot; based. It&#39;s what I&#39;ve always used, and if you dare tell me to switch to PI or something of the sort: fuck off.[/b]

Currently my NPCs only attack one person, even if agressive. I believe it has something to do with the index of who logs in first/last. For certain NPCs, I want them to attack everyone in a given area at the same time. Even if it applies the same damage to everyone.

Examples:
KBD hits 30 on player1, player2, player3
KBD hits 30 on player1, 45 on player2, and 10 on player3
KBD hits each person ONCE randomly

Does anyone have the slightest idea? I&#39;ll post code upon request, but here is my NPCHandler for some information: [url=http://pastebin.com/sz5KEDJq]http://pastebin.com/sz5KEDJq[/url]

I don&#39;t need to be spoon-fed. I just need the general idea what to do.</description>

              <p>I’m not a pro, but just a little thing I guess i’ve been thinking of.  Umm try to look for the method that lets the npc multi attack all the players in an area.  I’m still looking over your class, If i come up with anything else i’ll let you know.</p>
