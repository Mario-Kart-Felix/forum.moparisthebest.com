    <description>Posted this here before but never got round to buying one. 

I need a 265mb good quality card for general gaming and a bit of 3d rendering. 
PCI Express x16

A card that is stable and produces some high quality output. 

This?: http://www.amazon.co.uk/XFX-8600GT-620M-256MB-EXPRESS/dp/tech-data/B000P9ZG00/ref=de_a_smtd?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1213135725&amp;sr=1-1

oh yeh, this is why i wanna change lol

My idle cpu temp is usually around 50C which is a bit high isn&#39;t it?</description>
