ofc, but as i said the bugs are very easy to fix, the problem is just that there is a piss load of them. I think all the huge bugs are fixed on mine, not sure though but fixing glitches and dupes on my dueling atm.[/quote]Gtfo and never come back. No one cares about your fixed Delta, so stop trying to hijack this topic. You’ve made your point about giving a shit less about this project so I don’t care to hear your opinions anymore.</p>

<p>However, I’ll just let you know that I’m probably going to update it again with renames/recolors.</p>
<p>Note: My custom items aren’t weapons or armor, but things needed to make the game realistic (Eg. Dragon bars).</p>
<p>To make safe gems:<br>
Search a hay bale for 4 gems. It’s random so good luck. Use a hammer on each gem. Use a shard on the small furnace. Use the uncharged safe game on the Mysterious Glow (You need 25 Magic).</p>
<p>To raise Construction:<br>
Type ::build. Click the icon for tips.</p>
<p>To raise Firemaking: Obvious. Buy logs from the Construction store.</p>
<p>To raise Woodcutting:<br>
Grow trees from Construction and cut.</p>
<p>For now, you can’t get lobster pots. But you can still fish at the Varrock Fountain.</p>
<p>There’s more to figure out for yourself. I’ve got to go. Be back later.</p>
