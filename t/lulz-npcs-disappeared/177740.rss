    <title>Lulz, NPC&#39;s disappeared</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lulz-npcs-disappeared/177740</link>
    <description>[s]All my NPC&#39;s are gone on my server, even though they&#39;re still in the autospawn.cfg and my height level is 0.  I&#39;ve restarted the client and server to no avail.

I&#39;m also not getting any errors, such as a failure to load the autospawn or something along that line.  I&#39;m confused.[/s]

My client was making me think my height level was 0, but when I logged out it reset to -37.  I went up 37 times and found them again.</description>
