    <title>Matrix 718 base with MySQL Loading/Saving Character info</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/matrix-718-base-with-mysql-loading-saving-character-info/547926</link>
    <description>Hello,

As the title says i&#39;m looking for help in creating a database in MySQL that saves and loads user/character information instead of using .p files.

I want to use a database so i can use a web-based control panel and possibly link the database too.

I don&#39;t have a great experience with MySQL.
I do have limited knowledge of Java but not too advanced, but am use to programming in C++.

Any pointers into which files i should be looking at would be helpful, or even method that would be even more handy.

Thanks
