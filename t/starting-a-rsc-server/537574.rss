    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/starting-a-rsc-server/537574</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m new to this forum and new to Runescape classic servers. Me and my friend started playing them a lot and we want to set one up but were not sure where to start. I have tried to look up tutorials but cant find any good ones. Any help and info on starting a Runescape classic server would be much appreciated.</description>

I would say fiddle around with what you want and be a player. There is never no harm in learning, plus you could potentially go far!</p>

              <p>no problem bro if you are looking to start coding you must start somewhere.  This would be your best option to start with <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,340170.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,340170.0.html</a>.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of server you can have and they are database and text file.  The link above is a text file based server that is alot easier to figure out when you are new.  Once you Progress i would definitely look into a database server as you can do much more with it.</p>
