    <description>No where else has given me a hand, so lets try here.

Hey guys,

[I]All the information is at the top, nothing below the list.[/I]

I&#39;ve looked hard before posting this... and tried some of the stuff i found on forums; didn&#39;t work. 
This included...
Attempting to add them myself...
then; http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,463378.0.html &lt;---- Probably wrong and noobish..?
and i&#39;ve also asked some friends for help. None off which had a solution.

I&#39;m using a DSPK base (originally NICKname&#39;s base), trying to fix the godwars in it. (I think it uses a 474 cache with 602 animations but i could be wrong)

I would pay for help but considering as i have no money to do so with im very desperate for someone to help 

even if you just point out whats wrong along with a possible fix...

The only reward i can offer is REP++ to the person or people who help me to fix.. :)

Someone mentioned that the bosses will probably require new animation files?
Also mentioned that the sara maps was to do with the flo.dat in my cache?

Please, please, i beg of you, HELP im really lost on this lol! :(




Currently, the issues are as follows;

[B]Major:[/B]
-  Zamorak bosses, all animations are buggy (the don&#39;t appear when their standing still or attacking in some cases, sometimes they flicker when moving but other than that nothing) however they appear on the minimap (yellow dots)

- Saradomin room has a black floor + (dirty brown) water :(

[B]Minor[/B]
- Zamorak (some) walls are missing near boss room door.

- A Mushroom (house?) appears outside Bandos, Armadyl and sometimes Zamorak boss doors

- One corner wall missing in saradomin wall (next to boss room, which tbh isn&#39;t a big issue)

- Knight of saradomin has a red triangle when looking from one angle.
