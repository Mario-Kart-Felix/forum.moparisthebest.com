    <title>PkingDelay&#39;s value?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pkingdelays-value/273366</link>
    <description>Does anyone know where I can find the definition of PkingDelay?  I went into my client, and searched &#39;PkingDelay&#39; but only find it when a weapon or spell is defining it.  I found int PkingDelay = 0, but I can&#39;t find what it actually does, like the math behind it.  Anyone know?

Thanks.</description>

Does anyone know where I can find the definition of PkingDelay?  I went into my <span class="bbcode-b">client</span>, and searched ‘PkingDelay’ but only find it when a weapon or spell is defining it.  I found int PkingDelay = 0, but I can’t find what it actually does, like the math behind it.  Anyone know?</p>

<p>If this is client.java, please put it as <span class="bbcode-b">client.java</span>.[/quote]<br>
Isn’t it a bit obvious his question is server sided?</p>
