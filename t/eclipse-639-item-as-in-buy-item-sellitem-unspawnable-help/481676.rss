    <title>Eclipse 639 ::item (as in buy item) ::sellitem/unspawnable help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eclipse-639-item-as-in-buy-item-sellitem-unspawnable-help/481676</link>
    <description>I would like to know how to add a ::item/::sellitem command to buy unspawnable&#39;s

I would also like to make some unspawnable items unbuyable.

I have looked at Eclipse 639&#39;s codes but they do not seem to work. The only one I&#39;ve been able to implement is a ::item command to spawn every item.

Any ideas?</description>
