    <title>Advice on creating a Java engine for 2d game development?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/advice-on-creating-a-java-engine-for-2d-game-development/508244</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently working on an engine (which is kinda crappy right now) that I&#39;m planning to redo. It&#39;s mainly graphical based for users to create basic 2D games currently only following basic features such as adding objects, basic player movement with arrow keys and that&#39;s about it. 

What would you guys go around doing something some what similar because right now I&#39;m using Swing, and relying on KeyListener for all my action events which imo is not really the best approach because its not even half working lol. 

Any thoughts/ideas?</description>

              <p>Sorry if I was unclear to - I was not quiet planning on making my own library but more of a multi platform base for people to use and using slick looks cool <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>[quote=“Lin, post:8, topic:508244”]Here’s how I would make a 2D game engine:</p>
<p>-Create a base class or interface for game objects and inside it have properties like whether or not it’s enabled, etc…<br>
-Create a base class or interface for drawable objects and inside it have properties like its position, whether or not it’s visible, etc…<br>
-Have a method that pre-processes objects, processes objects, and (optional) post-processes objects. Unless specified, only process the objects in view.<br>
-Render all of the objects in view, automatically translating them based on the viewport. Since you have a base class for drawable objects, you could easily make other objects render in a specific way</p>
<p>And that’s pretty much it![/quote]</p>

<p>I believe she’s trying to make a modifiable game engine, not an engine for games… Obviously I’m not explaining it correctly, but I think she wants to make an already-functioning game which other people can modify, rather than a library for people to make their own games. I might be wrong though, either way I’ll help her</p>
<p>Edit: Did I mention she was a girl?<br>
