    <description>first...i have galkons client that i downloaded.  i also was trying to use some of the custom items and needed to compile it...so i thought &quot; hey....ill just use the compiler that came with it...&quot; Aww Heck no.....its not that easy...some reason, it wont compile...here is my code

@echo off
title Compiler
if exist &quot;%programfiles%\Java&quot; (call :compile &quot;%programfiles%\Java\&quot;) else (goto error)
:compile
for /D %%x in (&quot;%~1jdk*&quot;) do (set p=&quot;%%~x\bin\javac.exe&quot;)
if defined p (%p% -cp . *.java)
if defined p (goto end)
:error
echo You do not have Java installed. Please download it at the site that is about to load.
&quot;%programfiles%\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe&quot; http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
:end
echo Finished!
pause
exit

after i used the code it came in... and unsucessfully compiling the CLIENT  i came up with an error... here is the error


you do not have Java installed... 

and it also says:


&#39;about&#39; is not an internal or external command...or something like that

              <p>I had the same problem with that client… I just got a new compiler code… Try this one it works great</p>
<p><code>@echo off
COLOR 0a
title YOURSERVERNAME Compiler
echo -------------------------
echo Files Being Compiled...
echo -------------------------
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_20\bin\javac.exe" -cp . *.java
pause
</code></p>
<p>Change this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_20\bin\javac.exe</code></pre>
<p>To your JDK version and where it is located… most peoples jdk is located in program files but mine is located in program files (x86) change the _20 to your version eg. if you got jdk 17 you would change the 20 to a 17… Hope this helps!</p>
