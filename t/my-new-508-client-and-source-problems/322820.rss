    <title>My new 508! Client and Source Problems -.-</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-new-508-client-and-source-problems/322820</link>
    <description>Well i just got a new 508 source and client. It is pretty sweet because you can do skillcape emotes and its in hd  :eek: :eek:

The only problem is, i can not find the place to put my ip adress so the client can connect to the server. In the 317 i could ctrl+f server and it would find the correct location. Anybody know what i should do tho have it connect. IDC if it is leeched right now because i can change the rest of the stuf later.</description>

They are from the same exact post. I am having a problem finding that post again. I just do not know how to add the ip into it…</p>
<p>For my 317:</p>
<p>anInt957 = 0;<br>
anInt958 = 0;<br>
method52(true);<br>
aBoolean959 = true;<br>
signlink.storeid = 32;<br>
signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getLocalHost());<br>
setserver(“mabilicious.no-ip.biz”, “43594”);<br>
method2(503, false, 765);</p>
<p>Yet i cant figure out how to do that same thing wit my 508…  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

              <p>It depends on what client you have. I will not help you if you stole the client from a different server.</p>
<p>Use a base client as well as server and I will help you gladly, but stealing customs ect from a running server is as low as you can go.</p>

              <p>Im not leeching. I am using a base source. The only thing I am probably going to use from it is the graphics and skillcape emotes. The only thing i need to know how to do is direct the client to my ip. Your post was not very useful in helping me with that. Anybody who knows how to do what I am trying to do, please help.</p>
