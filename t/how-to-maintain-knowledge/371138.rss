    <title>How to maintain knowledge?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-maintain-knowledge/371138</link>
    <description>I finished school last June and because I am applying for uni in Australia, I have to wait till the end of February before I get back to studying.

I have already forgotten a lot of what I have learnt through A-level. I need ideas on how I can maintain the knowledge I have gained through A-level. I fear that when the time comes that I go to uni, I won&#39;t be as capable as I should be.

I&#39;ve already given away most, if not all of my books. Ideas?

tl;dr

How can I not forget the stuff I studied in school?</description>

That could be a mistake though. The textbook list could be updated due to new editions, etc. Or perhaps a new lecturer enters the fray and prefers one textbook over the previous textbook.<br>

well it doesn’t matter, course content shouldn’t change often and if it does it will at most be a change in order of material learned or one section added/removed</p>
<p>in the engineering programs at my uni, book edition changes usually just end up being the addition of some random crap just so they can sell a new textbook.</p>

<p>Some of it is obviously trapped in my brain somewhere, but I feel that during school I did not exert enough effort to ensure what I learnt would stick to my head. A lot of the things I would just memorize for the moment and never think about them ever again.</p>

              <p>Which subjects? In my opinion, I think the best learning is done by using at least two methods (ie, reading and hearing/listening), with content repeated over x days.</p>
<p>So say I was learning a foreign language, and working on vocabulary building.<br>
Firstly, I’d pick 20 - 30 words per day. Secondly, I’d write them out, reading as I go. Thirdly, I’d consider recording myself saying the word followed by the meaning. And then I’d listen to that recording.<br>
Basically, memory retention is enhanced by activating more areas of the brain AND repeating over consecutive days. You’re basically creating as many pathways as you can to the memory within your brain, using as many methods as possible.</p>
<p>If it’s a maths based subject (or even chemistry, among other sciences) then use <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.khanacademy.org/</a>.</p>

              <p>I finished school last June and because I am applying for uni in Australia, I have to wait till the end of February before I get back to studying.</p>
<p>I have already forgotten a lot of what I have learnt through A-level. I need ideas on how I can maintain the knowledge I have gained through A-level. I fear that when the time comes that I go to uni, I won’t be as capable as I should be.</p>
<p>I’ve already given away most, if not all of my books. Ideas?</p>
<p>tl;dr</p>
<p>How can I not forget the stuff I studied in school?</p>
