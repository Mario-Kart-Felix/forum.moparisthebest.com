    <title>Funniest old drunk ever!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/funniest-old-drunk-ever/35140</link>
    <description>Well, quite recently, a friend of mine introduced me to a man by the name of Worth McDonald. He was an elderly man, around the age of 50, and he rang him up. I couldn&#39;t stop laughing after our first conversations, and began to record our conversations. I have now made a website with my friend, and we are beginning to upload some of the conversations we had for others to hear. Please come register and listen! Hope you enjoy listening! I have a ton more to upload!
