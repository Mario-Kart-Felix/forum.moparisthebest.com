    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-help-with-a-server/310168</link>
    <description>Okay I&#39;m going to be completely blunt about this, I don&#39;t really know much Java and I want to start a decent server due to the fact that ones I have tried recently are kinda...well eh.  Any way I need some help creating a server, working on webclient right now forums are almost done just the server &quot;hard part&quot; left to do.  No-ip working as well.  Here&#39;s where I&#39;m stuck, I would like to not leech but someone will my skillset will have a retarded time making my own until i learn more.. soo with that said. I DO NOT want to copy someones exact server, which i could have done already, i want to edit it the way i want it set up.  which i understand is still leaching but its only temperary.  really kinda just need someone that can help show me the ropes and help set this up for now. thanks. email me at below email pls.

              <p>I’m not a moderator but i would think this is the wrong section to post this. If all you are doing is editing code to say “yourname” Scape for everything and want someone to do it for you then no offense but you are just being lazy. Anyone could leech a server and just edit “realnameofsourcescape” into “leechedsourcenamescape” in the code for every file in a matter of hours if you want to do a good job. That is exactly what I did for my server besides the extras i added myself. If you want me to build your server no, if you would like to join my server that’s a completely different story. Otherwise you might want to move to a different forum/website or even better buy a cheap Vps that has a pre-installed customizable source. If you still aren’t satisfied with my suggestions you should consider paying someone by the hour to code your server for you from scratch or from some sort of base. If you have no money or just no accepted method of money transfer (the most common issue with dealing with real world currency) then the best you can do is try to learn on your own (what i did) or from someone else willing to teach you (I did this as well). If I have some spare time between certain parts of my almost air-tight schedule I could try to give you some basics on leeching a server by bypassing anti-leech features, editing things in quotes, and basic customization ect. (Basically something a noob would do). But hey i’m not the best coder either you could call me a noob when it comes down to coding or anything related to it.</p>
