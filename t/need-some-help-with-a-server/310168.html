        <p>I’m not a moderator but i would think this is the wrong section to post this. If all you are doing is editing code to say “yourname” Scape for everything and want someone to do it for you then no offense but you are just being lazy. Anyone could leech a server and just edit “realnameofsourcescape” into “leechedsourcenamescape” in the code for every file in a matter of hours if you want to do a good job. That is exactly what I did for my server besides the extras i added myself. If you want me to build your server no, if you would like to join my server that’s a completely different story. Otherwise you might want to move to a different forum/website or even better buy a cheap Vps that has a pre-installed customizable source. If you still aren’t satisfied with my suggestions you should consider paying someone by the hour to code your server for you from scratch or from some sort of base. If you have no money or just no accepted method of money transfer (the most common issue with dealing with real world currency) then the best you can do is try to learn on your own (what i did) or from someone else willing to teach you (I did this as well). If I have some spare time between certain parts of my almost air-tight schedule I could try to give you some basics on leeching a server by bypassing anti-leech features, editing things in quotes, and basic customization ect. (Basically something a noob would do). But hey i’m not the best coder either you could call me a noob when it comes down to coding or anything related to it.</p>
