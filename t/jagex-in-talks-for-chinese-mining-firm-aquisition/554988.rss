May be somewhere else on here but I only pay attention to this section ;) 

[url=http://massivelyop.com/2016/03/15/jagex-has-been-sold-to-a-chinese-company-for-300m/]http://massivelyop.com/2016/03/15/jagex-has-been-sold-to-a-chinese-company-for-300m/[/url]

https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4aj280/multiple_reports_that_jagex_has_been_sold_to/


Lots of interesting comments. 


&lt;blockquote&gt;[font=bitter][size=13px]according to Jagex mods, it hasn&#39;t been done yet..Mod Ronan, posted 2 hours ago on reddit that it is in the early stages of discussion[/size][/font]&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;[font=bitter][size=13px]Capital is fleeing China in anticipation of future yuan devaluation. Part of China&#39;s ongoing capital flight is expressing itself as M&amp;A deals.  Since China has instituted capital controls to slow the flood of money fleeing yuan-valued holdings, one way for money to leave is for Chinese companies to purchase overseas companies.  I doubt they care one bit about managing the company directly.  Also, M&amp;A deals (and stock buy backs) are a late business cycle development.  Real revenue growth is increasingly difficult so corporations opt for paper growth through financial shuffling or acquisitions.  After even that type of &#39;growth&#39; sputters out, then comes the correction.[/size][/font][font=bitter][size=13px]The reason that iron ore companies are doing something like this is because the iron ore mining industry in China is falling apart because the Chinese gov. sponsored a massive expansion of the steel industry.  China produces most of the world&#39;s steel but there is no commensurate demand for it, especially as debt financed ghost city building type boondoggles have ground to a halt.  They are going to be laying off literally hundreds of thousands to millions of steel industry workers very soon.  So an iron ore company that can still get credit would be desperate to buy any viable business.[/size][/font]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[font=bitter][size=13px]To give you an idea of how horribly mismanaged Chinese growth has been: the Chinese produced more cement in 2011-2012 than the U.S. did during the entire 20th century.  That is the definition of unsustainable growth and capital misallocation.  Hopefully, when things start to crash, the foreign companies purchased by Chinese companies won&#39;t be liquidated for assets to pay off debt.[/size][/font]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[font=bitter][size=13px]China is in the process of getting rid of the one child policy because they dont have enough workers to sustain growth. They are freaking out right now trying to avoid disaster. Its not looking good. [/size][/font]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[font=bitter][size=13px]Vivendi Redux? Vivendi was a century old French water company whose CEO wanted more trendy and thus ended up owning Activision-Blizzard.

China&#39;s trade surplus (exports-imports) in January was USD63.29 billion.  So every day a couple of billion dollars goes into China. Just like Japan in the 80s, that capital is going to get spent and some not wisely.  China is the largest gaming market and TenCent is the largest gaming company in the world. 


P.S.: Vivendi is accumulating stock in Ubisoft so their gaming story is not over.


P.P.S.: this is an example of why I shake my head when someone says a gaming company will never do something. A new CEO or CEO vision in your company or an acquiring company and some other entity/people could be making the decisions.[/size][/font]&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
