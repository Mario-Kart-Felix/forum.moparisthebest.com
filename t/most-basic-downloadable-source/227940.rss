    <title>Most Basic Downloadable Source?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/most-basic-downloadable-source/227940</link>
    <description>OK, I&#39;m Going To Try To Make This Pretty Clear
I&#39;m Going To Make An Entirely New Server. Does Anyone Know Of A Silabsoft Source That Doesn&#39;t Have A Lot Of Things Added To It?
I&#39;m Just Going To Go Through It, Delete All The NPCs, Get Rid Of The Standard Quests, Etc., Then Fully Customize It So It Is Entirely Original.

I Know That So Far All I&#39;ve Done Is Ask Questions, But I Want To Get Everything Right So I Don&#39;t Screw Something Up Or Get Stuck With A Days Worth Of Work Just Deleting Pointless Objects And Voids.</description>

Nice Tip.[/quote][/sarcasm]<br>
And I Didn’t Ask Anyone To Search For Me, I Asked If Anyone Knew Of A Blank Source So I Wouldn’t Have To Go Through Multiple Threads With Multiple Broken Links And Etc…</p>
<p>But Just To Stop The Pointless Flaming With Someone I Don’t Know, I’m Sorry That I Don’t Have Time To Waste From Doing More Productive Things With My Time And Checking To See If Anyone Had Any Recommendations For Blank Sources.</p>
