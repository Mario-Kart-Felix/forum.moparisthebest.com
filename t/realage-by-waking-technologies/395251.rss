    <title>RealAge by Waking Technologies</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/realage-by-waking-technologies/395251</link>
    <description>Hey Guise! I&#39;m just here to give you guys a program I made earlier today. Took roughly about 1 hour total. It&#39;s only version 1 and I plan to add updates, features, etc...

The program is called RealAge. And my Local Software Company Waking Technologies(registered in my local area, I am the owner) and I planned this a few days ago. What it does right now is it lets you input your date of birth. And then it calculates how old you really are.

It will tell you how many years have passed since your birth date. And then it will tell you how far you are until your next birthday.
Example:

I was born July 23, 1996.
[code]
INPUT:
23
7
1996
OUTPUT:
14 years and 0.810958904109589% old[/code]

I know. At it&#39;s first stages it&#39;s pretty useless. but you can change the date and use it for other purposes. Simply substitute the birth date for your starting date. And the current date for the date you wish to find the difference from.

It is a windows form application.

I don&#39;t feel the need to post pictures since I have a programmer&#39;s distributable version. So you can see all of the source code and determine for yourself if it&#39;s safe or not, which I completely assure you, it is.

All feedback and suggestions on any future updates and features are greatly appreciated. (Also, if anybody could help design an icon. That would be great, if you look at the icon in the download, you can see I&#39;m pretty terrible and generic(Though that&#39;s not my best work at all).)

http://www.mediafire.com/?d4l9b0xcx1jjng9 (Programmer Version)
http://www.mediafire.com/?koaechjenzi5zbq (Normal Version - .EXE and .ICO file)


THINGS I PLAN TO FIX:
I plan to truncate the decimal number to the max of 3 decimals.
I plan to update the labels for universal use.
Get a better Icon.
Change the GUI to a more user friendly but professional look.</description>

My grammar only slacks on this website. I do not take my time to write out everything and make sure everything is perfect. What would the point of that even be? For a few kids to try to undermine my abilities? It’s no difference. I assure you that my grammar is very good outside of a kids Runescape forum. My average dialect involves words and grammar structures that most of the people on this forum could not understand, even if I took the time to explain.</p>

If you guys think you are cool or anything above arrogant, you are sadly mistaken. You are just as bad, if not worse than me for evening bothering. If my creation is so pointless, then why are you all taking your time to comment on my post? Tell me, if I’m such a failure as you all claim me to be. Why are you all still here? Wasting your time commenting and arguing back and forth. Seriously. I’m not even the bad guy. You guys are all idiots.</p>
<p>I’ve said this over and over. This program is not useful. It’s not some top of the line thing. It’s just something you can use to find the exact age difference by Day. You keep posting about how it’s so useless and how nobody will use it. Multiple people have downloaded it, and I can think of at least 5 ways that you could use this program.</p>
<p>If you people honestly think that I’m stupid, then you have a serious mental condition.</p>

<p>this part made me chuckle. if you cannot even spell “guys,” i’m sure you can’t pass secondary. (reference to the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,492438.msg3600527.html#msg3600527" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">OP</a>).</p>

<p>You seem to misunderstand my wordplay. Guise is a word to describe ones appearance to the general public. And since everybody on here is by default, anonymous, I can only assume your guise.(Very similar to disguise, but dis negates the normal definition, meaning a misleading appearance). It’s word play. Instead of assuming that you are all “GUYS”, I used the word “GUISE” because it sounds very alike and it is a word to describe in unisex.<br>

<p>Good Lord you need to go to secondary school. There are enough comma splices in your replies to make my former English teacher pull her hair out.</p>

</aside>
<p>My grammar is good, though I prefer to use comma’s as a way to form pauses in sentences. You are right. I do use a lot of comma’s, but that is because I don’t like to use ‘…’ whenever I want a small pause in between a sentence or a word. It’s improper, but at least I spell properly and don’t write like a idiot.</p>

<p>I go to a technical School. And I am not even considered a part of the school. I’m sure if you are so high and mighty, That you have heard of the STEM initiative? I’m enrolled in STEM courses for everything. I learn hardware engineering along with software and electrical engineering. And I can guarantee that I’m more than qualified to skip all years of secondary school. I’m not your average student. I don’t need to justify myself. I don’t need to provide proof(Though I can.). I don’t even need to respond to such arrogance. But I do out of choice. I know what I am, what I do, and what I can do. And it’s as simple as that. Your choice to attempt to underestimate or undermine me is yours. As well as your choice to believe my words. I honestly couldn’t care less about your opinion because you are probably around the same age as me, or older than me. And the fact remains that my intellectual capabilities are probably better than yours.</p>

<p>Ridicule, the only thing you are doing over the internet is making a few of my pixels change colors that shape letters. The only thing you can do face to face is emit a few sound waves that I can hear. Everything we all say means nothing. So deal with it.</p>

<p>I seem to highly doubt you guys are putting together your own hardware (aka, buying a blank circuit board and putting in transitors, resistors, etc). WAY cheaper to buy parts from other companies than to develop them for yourself only. Especially being non-profit, money has to come from somewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We are in school for this kind of thing. So we don’t mind the extra costs to better prepare ourselves and get the extra experience. Besides, it’s a passion and a hobby. It’s what we like to do. Though I clearly said we aren’t making hardware for others. We will make it for ourselves only that way we can keep our accomplishments close to use.<br>
The money comes from personal savings and what we earn from jobs and such. Much like I save up for a new graphics card. I save up to buy parts and build them.<br>
[/quote]<br>
;), ok tell me the difference between a C-MOS and N-MOS transistor and why do we still use three terminal device such as BJT’s as you know MOSFET’s are much cheaper to mass produce vs BJT’s so tell me hardware guru why we still use them.<br>
and how do you bias these devices?</p>
<p>i appreciate your enthusiasm, if this is just your starting its all good, i am sure u want to own a company or develop something good but small steps will do for now, yes your product is your hard work but its not something out of the box. So keep on going for your dream <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>P.S, just to add, if it seems simple don’t think its worthless, i know a guy from my uni, over the x-mas holiday’s he made a software where you draw a shape and the software matches pictures in it, like a photo collage, and he has his own company with the product and make about $80,000 early revenue from that products and others he recently made. So as long there is a demand its not stupid.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m in school for it. No, I’m not a hardware guru and never claimed to be. I’m in school and I like to develop my own hardware step by step from how I am learning to.</p>
<p>[quote=“iKilem, post:18, topic:395251”]Did I miss the part where OP was boosting his ego?</p>
<aside class="quote">

<p>You seriously think this was hard?</p>

</aside>
<p>Probably for him. Where in his posts does he imply that this is a show-off?</p>
<aside class="quote">

</aside>
<p>Where did he mention he was a hardware guru or even pretend to be a guru?</p>
<p>cedaw and n10si t are trying too hard.[/quote]<br>
You see what others don’t. And you are right. I never did boast about it being a great accomplishment. And it wasn’t a hard task. Though trying to find the right equation took about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>I never said this was the greatest software ever. I never said it was hard work. I never said that I was the best programmer. I never said that I was a profitable company. And I never said I would mass produce anything. I don’t plan to mass produce any type of hardware, and I don’t plan to sell any product, be it software or hardware, made by Waking Technologies or myself.</p>
<p>Most of you are all pretty simple minded, so before you try to put down another’s goals, ambitions, or work. Why don’t you first think about what you say, and what it really means. Make sure it’s relevant, and make sure it matches up with the facts. Don’t waste my time with some bullshit reply that only points out 1 thing, and is most likely corrected, reassured, or explained later in the post.</p>
<p>Good day.</p>

<p>Probably for him. Where in his posts does he imply that this is a show-off?</p>

I seem to highly doubt you guys are putting together your own hardware (aka, buying a blank circuit board and putting in transitors, resistors, etc). WAY cheaper to buy parts from other companies than to develop them for yourself only. Especially being non-profit, money has to come from somewhere.<br>
[/quote]<br>
We are in school for this kind of thing. So we don’t mind the extra costs to better prepare ourselves and get the extra experience. Besides, it’s a passion and a hobby. It’s what we like to do. Though I clearly said we aren’t making hardware for others. We will make it for ourselves only that way we can keep our accomplishments close to use.<br>
The money comes from personal savings and what we earn from jobs and such. Much like I save up for a new graphics card. I save up to buy parts and build them.[/quote]<br>
;), ok tell me the difference between a C-MOS and N-MOS transistor and why do we still use three terminal device such as BJT’s as you know MOSFET’s are much cheaper to mass produce vs BJT’s so tell me hardware guru why we still use them.<br>
and how do you bias these devices?</p>
<p>i appreciate your enthusiasm, if this is just your starting its all good, i am sure u want to own a company or develop something good but small steps will do for now, yes your product is your hard work but its not something out of the box. So keep on going for your dream <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>P.S, just to add, if it seems simple don’t think its worthless, i know a guy from my uni, over the x-mas holiday’s he made a software where you draw a shape and the software matches pictures in it, like a photo collage, and he has his own company with the product and make about $80,000 early revenue from that products and others he recently made. So as long there is a demand its not stupid.</p>
