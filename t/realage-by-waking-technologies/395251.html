        <p>Hey Guise! I’m just here to give you guys a program I made earlier today. Took roughly about 1 hour total. It’s only version 1 and I plan to add updates, features, etc…</p>
<p>The program is called RealAge. And my Local Software Company Waking Technologies(registered in my local area, I am the owner) and I planned this a few days ago. What it does right now is it lets you input your date of birth. And then it calculates how old you really are.</p>
<p>It will tell you how many years have passed since your birth date. And then it will tell you how far you are until your next birthday.<br>
Example:</p>
<p>I was born July 23, 1996.</p>
<p><code>
INPUT:
23
7
1996
OUTPUT:
14 years and 0.810958904109589% old</code></p>
<p>I know. At it’s first stages it’s pretty useless. but you can change the date and use it for other purposes. Simply substitute the birth date for your starting date. And the current date for the date you wish to find the difference from.</p>
<p>It is a windows form application.</p>
<p>I don’t feel the need to post pictures since I have a programmer’s distributable version. So you can see all of the source code and determine for yourself if it’s safe or not, which I completely assure you, it is.</p>
<p>All feedback and suggestions on any future updates and features are greatly appreciated. (Also, if anybody could help design an icon. That would be great, if you look at the icon in the download, you can see I’m pretty terrible and generic(Though that’s not my best work at all).)</p>

<p>THINGS I PLAN TO FIX:<br>
I plan to truncate the decimal number to the max of 3 decimals.<br>
I plan to update the labels for universal use.<br>
Get a better Icon.<br>
Change the GUI to a more user friendly but professional look.</p>

<p>I’ve had this company for a few years now. We pay for the registration of our company name. We don’t have a building or a website because we don’t advertise. We have a company name because we want to keep our products as our own. We register our products as our property, and we want people to realize what we do. Which is make software thats powerful, efficient, and most of all. Easy to use by the general population. I mean lets face it, this world is filled with retards that don’t know big words, and probably cannot even write with proper spelling or grammar if they wanted to. So it’s hard for a lot of people to find software that is easy to understand and use to it’s fullest. Which is what we aim to do. Make powerful but easy to use software. Not everybody is going to agree with what we do, but we don’t care. We are a non-profit organisation and we don’t aim to sell products or gain to much benefit.</p>
<p>Programming to me and my friends is a passion, not just a career. We do it because it’s fun. Not because one day it will pay the bills.</p>
<p>-EDIT-<br>
I forgot to answer part of your question. I apologize. Waking Technologies is just a name. We(My friend and I) are the sole employees and he wanted to work with me on products such as software develop and hardware development. And I told him that I still have my old company name registered from when I was deep into that kind of stuff. And he asked if he could work with me. And I said yes. We both agreed to be business partners. We plan to build computers and raffle them off(eventually). And develop useful or fun software and release it all for free.</p>

<p>I’ve had this company for a few years now. We pay for the registration of our company name. We don’t have a building or a website because we don’t advertise. We have a company name because we want to keep our products as our own. We register our products as our property, and we want people to realize what we do. Which is make software thats powerful, efficient, and most of all. Easy to use by the general population. I mean lets face it, this world is filled with retards that don’t know big words, and probably cannot even write with proper spelling or grammar if they wanted to. So it’s hard for a lot of people to find software that is easy to understand and use to it’s fullest. Which is what we aim to do. Make powerful but easy to use software.

<p>We develop hardware for ourselves. We will build our own computer components and use them for ourselves. but we won’t be selling or giving away our hardware. Though we might, as I said before, raffle off hardware from other companies and computers. In the original and unopened packaging of course.</p>

<p>We are in school for this kind of thing. So we don’t mind the extra costs to better prepare ourselves and get the extra experience. Besides, it’s a passion and a hobby. It’s what we like to do. Though I clearly said we aren’t making hardware for others. We will make it for ourselves only that way we can keep our accomplishments close to use.<br>
The money comes from personal savings and what we earn from jobs and such. Much like I save up for a new graphics card. I save up to buy parts and build them.</p>

I seem to highly doubt you guys are putting together your own hardware (aka, buying a blank circuit board and putting in transitors, resistors, etc). WAY cheaper to buy parts from other companies than to develop them for yourself only. Especially being non-profit, money has to come from somewhere.<br>
[/quote]<br>
We are in school for this kind of thing. So we don’t mind the extra costs to better prepare ourselves and get the extra experience. Besides, it’s a passion and a hobby. It’s what we like to do. Though I clearly said we aren’t making hardware for others. We will make it for ourselves only that way we can keep our accomplishments close to use.<br>
The money comes from personal savings and what we earn from jobs and such. Much like I save up for a new graphics card. I save up to buy parts and build them.[/quote]<br>
;), ok tell me the difference between a C-MOS and N-MOS transistor and why do we still use three terminal device such as BJT’s as you know MOSFET’s are much cheaper to mass produce vs BJT’s so tell me hardware guru why we still use them.<br>
and how do you bias these devices?</p>
<p>i appreciate your enthusiasm, if this is just your starting its all good, i am sure u want to own a company or develop something good but small steps will do for now, yes your product is your hard work but its not something out of the box. So keep on going for your dream <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>P.S, just to add, if it seems simple don’t think its worthless, i know a guy from my uni, over the x-mas holiday’s he made a software where you draw a shape and the software matches pictures in it, like a photo collage, and he has his own company with the product and make about $80,000 early revenue from that products and others he recently made. So as long there is a demand its not stupid.</p>

You see what others don’t. And you are right. I never did boast about it being a great accomplishment. And it wasn’t a hard task. Though trying to find the right equation took about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>I never said this was the greatest software ever. I never said it was hard work. I never said that I was the best programmer. I never said that I was a profitable company. And I never said I would mass produce anything. I don’t plan to mass produce any type of hardware, and I don’t plan to sell any product, be it software or hardware, made by Waking Technologies or myself.</p>
<p>Most of you are all pretty simple minded, so before you try to put down another’s goals, ambitions, or work. Why don’t you first think about what you say, and what it really means. Make sure it’s relevant, and make sure it matches up with the facts. Don’t waste my time with some bullshit reply that only points out 1 thing, and is most likely corrected, reassured, or explained later in the post.</p>
<p>Good day.</p>
