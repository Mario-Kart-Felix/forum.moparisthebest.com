    <description>I&#39;m allowing him to play, nobody knows who he is, but the server needs the activity as he brings a lot of positive attention with him. He can&#39;t do any damage and doesn&#39;t really intend to. If he griefs then it&#39;ll be rolled back and he&#39;ll be banned. 

If you have an issue with this, then we&#39;ll discuss it here and weigh up the arguments though I&#39;d really prefer it if you came on the IRC and discussed this, forum debating is such a treacherous process.</description>

              <p>One thing he always did was not greif on his main account, but create other accounts, plant a lot of expensive blocks (like diamond), then greif people, essentially duping diamonds and iron and stuff.  This is why we stopped those types of blocks from being recorded, but core doesn’t support that, so you have to specify it when you roll things back.  Make sure to do that or he will start to duplicate items again.</p>
