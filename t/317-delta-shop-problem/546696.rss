    <title>317 Delta, Shop problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-shop-problem/546696</link>
    <description>After finding out why my shops weren&#39;t working I happened to stumble on the problem. After clicking talk to the shop npc nothing happens, however after you hit talk and then hit use quickly on the bank the bank opens up right away and your guy will continue to walk to it. Once he finally reaches the bank the interface switches to the shop interface. I don&#39;t know if this makes sense to you guys, but I&#39;m not really sure where to change this. Thank you if you can help.</description>

<p>Are you able to right click, and press “trade with” on the NPC? If that opens the shop then I do not see a problem because that is how most deltas are coded.</p>

</aside>
<p>The shop shouldn’t be opening when he try’s opening the bank… Also, if you would read. He stated that the shop does nothing.</p>
<p>OP: Post your firstClickObject. Should be packet 132. Also post your first/second click npc. Packets: 155 and 17</p>
