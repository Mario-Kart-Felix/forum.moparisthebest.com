    <title>Logging in easy rsc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/logging-in-easy-rsc/454780</link>
    <description>Hey kinda new to the whole development thing and was wondering how to log into the client as admin on easy rsc and also i want to work on making some of the quests and adding new content to the server... i would like to get some graphic designers to start designing some new kinds of armour and new items as well as adding to the maps, and mini games possibly... i have the landscape editor peter made but it doesn&#39;t work like i would want it too...

thanks, tim</description>

              <p>i looked at the server panel and theres no names off to the right of it when i run server (no admin,no players) , but i dont seem to be able to find the place where u create your ingame account… i kno where “the players” is, located in the server folder (all there is a template file inside there) i know it seems dumb i just want to make an account, and theres no option to create an account ingame account on the client buttons when u load up the client screen…</p>

              <p>Create ur ingame account, then go to SERVER FOLDER and here u have PLAYERS. Open PLAYERS folder and find ur name here. Open CGF file with Notepad or Notepad++ and find for this :<br>
“rank=0” change this 0 to 4 like : “rank=4” then save and login back in game !</p>
<p>P.S : while u edit ur file, u must be logged off server.</p>
