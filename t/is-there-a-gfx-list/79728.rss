    <title>Is there a GFX list?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-a-gfx-list/79728</link>
    <description>I was wondering if there was a GFX list with their IDs so I can make my own custom glows. I got bored of just the basic blue, red, and purple rings. I already made two custom ones but I want to know the IDs of some of the other GFX. Can anyone help me with this?  :confused:</description>
