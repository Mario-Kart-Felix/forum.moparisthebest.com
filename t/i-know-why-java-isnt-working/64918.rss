              <p>That explains it I guess, because I keep getting “Loading Java Applet Failed”, I even tried re-downloading java, Moparscape, ActiveX, none of it’s working; I also just spent $40 for a program that would scan all of my Java, files, ActiveX… etc. But there were tons of problems, so I guess it wasn’t just wasted money, but thanks for posting this it helps releive the stress.</p>
<p>Also, does this mean no one can get on any servers for the rest of the day?</p>
