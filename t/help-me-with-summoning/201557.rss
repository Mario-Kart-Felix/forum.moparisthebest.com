    <title>Help me with summoning?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-with-summoning/201557</link>
    <description>1st i need to make my music tab show the same/similar thing as the quest tab so i can make it say
Level1-Goblin
LEvel-5 ZOmbie
Level-10 Ghost 
Etc. How do i do that?

And when you click on it it spawns the monster. -
So when u click it it will spawn that monster, like the ::Addnpc command, but i do not want the ::Addnpc command available to every1 so i will rename. I think i got that.

And how do i make a delay so it only lets you spawn a certain ammount per time,
like i spawn 1, and it wont let em spawn until its dead or something. How do i do that?

please help, 

thanks.</description>
