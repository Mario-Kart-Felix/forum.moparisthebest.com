    <title>RedSkyCraft - Hunger Games, PVP, Survival, &amp; Creative</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/redskycraft-hunger-games-pvp-survival-creative/455729</link>
    <description>RedSkyCraft is a fun Bukkit server with friendly staff and owner. Some of the plugins we have are: Essentials, Lockette, McMMO, RuneCraft, EasyEnchant, MultiVerse, MultiInv, KissMe, ChestShop, iConomy, Hawk Eye, and more. Griefing and raiding is allowed only in the PVP world, but griefing or stealing in the Survival world or Creative world will likely get you banned. We are open to suggestions and have recently expanded server capacity to a 48 slot server plus added 500MB RAM. Survival Games world is now up and running as well. Hope to see you there!

Note - We just expanded capacity from 32 to 48! This should help reduce lag and make a new Survival Games World possible. 

New website: http://redskyunited.com

If the domain mc.redskyunited isn&#39;t working, you can try the direct ip: 184.171.249.202
