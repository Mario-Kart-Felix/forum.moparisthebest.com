<p>Most likely, their ‘far better’ technology is just a new Client, with more stuff done serverside. (Pain re-doing all the defs -.-)</p>

<p>I think they realised that a long time ago… But theres no harm in them trying.<br>
And they have made progress. I find it kind of sad how many noobs there are on cheating forums that think their so much better than Jagex, but their lives completly revolve around their game.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Actually, The blitz languages have problems with duel CPU computers, the frame-rate drops like a bitch, but I think it depeneds on your CPU because some people have problems, others don’t.</p>
<p>About the JDk, appearntly you can’t decompile it or something? I’ve heard Mopar say it a few times, I think.</p>

It’s like a tyrannical government announcing publically that new laws will be in place to protect ORDER, and the masses cheer and lick it all up in excitement.</p>
<p>Pretty soon the only determining factor for status on Runescape will be how many hours of your life you have wasted on it. Forget playing the market, having rich friends, using computer skills, or being the first one at an update… now it is about loyal puppets who sit passively at their computer praising anything thrown at their boredom.</p>

              <p>John, the really sad thing is Jagex arranges the release of their “new plans” so that is sounds fun and appealing to everyone else. It’s like a tyrannical government announcing publically that new laws will be in place to protect ORDER, and the masses cheer and lick it all up in excitement.</p>
<p>Pretty soon the only determining factor for status on Runescape will be how many hours of your life you have wasted on it. Forget playing the market, having rich friends, using computer skills, or being the first one at an update… now it is about loyal puppets who sit passively at their computer praising anything thrown at their boredom.</p>
<p>Yes, that includes a kiddy crane.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

How can anything they code into a Java applet possibly have an effect on something so hardware-specific?
<p>As for the better macro detection, bring it on. Maybe they can finally kill Aryan.</p>
<p>And updating the JDK would do…what, exactly?</p>

I just hope when they do all the client changes moparscape will still work lol. I love it</p>
