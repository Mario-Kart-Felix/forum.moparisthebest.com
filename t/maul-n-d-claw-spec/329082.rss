    <description>I am in the process of adding dclaws in my 317 yea i know close to impossible to do, but i have somewhat done it and i have them added in and it shows the name, spec bar, but only 2hits no matter what, i even tryed adding in the customcommand(&quot;veng&quot;); thing but still only 2hits, anyway? and also im adding in the maulspec to this concern bcuz, i would like2 know what makes the spec happen slow, maybe i could speed it up and make the maul hit 4times and possibly get closer to fixing dclaws spec, i know its dealing with timers of some kind, is it the specialdelay thing? and if not, wut is the specialdelay and how do i use it?
