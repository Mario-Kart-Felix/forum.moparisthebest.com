    <title>Diablo II Make Characters Active</title>

    <description>Hey mates,

I&#39;ve been looking for a program, hack, or cheat that will make sure my characters don&#39;t expire, but haven&#39;t found one so I came to you guys...the scripters. :) I have over 24 characters and I don&#39;t want to wait 2 hours in the game for each one, because that is the only way that they become active. I won&#39;t have to click on them again until 3 months then. Is there a program, hack, or cheat that will put one mule in the game for 2 hours, logout, and then click on the second mule, then doing the same thing over and over. If anyone knows a program that does this, please tell me. If not, can someone please make a script or program to make what I described above happen? I don&#39;t know if it is possible, but anyway, I just wanted to ask. Thanks, and have a nice day!

Thanks again,
Leader

P.S. If you need any more information about what I need this program/script to do, please contact me via PM or in this thread. Also, if you don&#39;t mind creating the program/script, please contact me too. Once again, thanks. Also, if this was in the wrong section, feel free to move it - I apologize for my mistake.</description>
