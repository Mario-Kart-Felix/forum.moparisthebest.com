• Fight Caves – The TzHaar Fight Caves is a mini-game in which you fight waves of Tz-Kih, Tz-Kek, Tok-Xil, Yt-Mejkot, Ket-Zek, Yt-Hurkot and the final stage, TzTok-Jad. Unlike other servers, Jad is a difficult fight and takes massive skill to vanquish. After one dies, their items will be kept, making it a safe mini-game. However, if you are luckier than most and defeat the Mighty 702, you will be awarded a Fire Cape, which is untradable, but has better stat bonuses than any other cape in the server.

• Kalphite Queen – The Kalphite Queen mini-game involves fighting the Kalphite Queen’s two forms -possibly with a team – all the while battling a few workers and soldiers along with two guardians. Again, unlike other servers, the Queen isn’t easy to kill. There is indeed a decent chance that you will be awarded with the Dragon Chainbody after victory, a powerful and expensive chestplate which there is only one other way to obtain (Dust Devils).

• Burial Mounds – Also known as the tumuli, here you have the ability to dig up and fight the spirits of six ancient and powerful warriors (Dharok, Karil, Ahrim, Verac, Torag and Guthan) for the chance to get a piece of rare, expensive and powerful weaponry. Be weary, for if and when you lose, you will not receive any of your items back.

• God Wars – The God Wars Dungeon is an ancient war zone which contains four fearsome beasts, K&#39;ril Tsutsaroth for Zamorak, Commander Zilyana for Saradomin, Kree’arra for Armadyl and General Graardor for Bandos. Killing one of these generals will give you a chance to get your paws on some otherwise unattainable gear, such as godsword pieces and Bandos or Armadyl armour.

• Working Prayer – All prayers are currently in full function, including the protection prayers. Yes, they work vs. both NPCs and in PvP.

• Fully Working Projectiles – Whether the user is an NPC or a player, our magic and range projectiles work. This includes the dark bow’s double arrows, ancients, regular magic attacks and lunar spells!

• Ancients &amp; Lunar – Speaking of ancients, a player would have to complete our version of the Desert Treasure quest to use Ancient Magiks, and our version of Lunar Diplomacy to use Lunar Magiks. 

• Correct Death Emotes – Unlike many servers, when a monster dies, it won’t fold into itself with a bunch of lines going every which way. Also, a players death will be aesthetically pleasing.

• Full Specs – All special attacks and effects function well, including all Dragon weapons, the Dark bow spec, Godsword specs, the Barrelchest Anchor, and the Barrows Brother’s abilities. 

 • Skills – We have theiving, fishing, firemaking, woodcutting, runecrafting, agility, crafting, fletching, slayer, mining, smithing, and cooking available to all players!

• Starter – A measly starter will be available to all new players one time, which comes in the form of a package and contains 45K.

• Stable Economy – The prices of items and the availability of gold is balanced well, so this makes for a perfectly stable economy which shouldn’t ever crash. Not to mention the bountiful different methods of making money!


• Shop Area – The shop area contains many different items, from armor to items needed to advance in various skills, and everything in between!

• PvP – There are many ways to show off your dominance in CitruScape. There are team zones, such as the one north of Varrock, solo zones, such as the one north of Edgeville, the Duel Arena in Al-Kharid and the Pk Box.

• Aggressive Monsters – Just like in real RuneScape, certain monsters will attack anyone they come across, so be weary folks!


Some Notes: These plans are in VERY early forms of development, so I still need to figure out a good base. I hope that the members of this community could suggest one. I need a Co-Owner (one who could help me with most or all of these features), two Admins (who could help me with a few of these or more), and a few Mods (who could help me with atleast two of these features).

Be weary, for if and when you lose, you will not receive any of your items back.</p>

<p>• Working Prayer – All prayers are currently in full function, including the protection prayers. Yes, they work vs. both NPCs and in PvP.</p>
<p>• Fully Working Projectiles – Whether the user is an NPC or a player, our magic and range projectiles work. This includes the dark bow’s double arrows, ancients, regular magic attacks and lunar spells!</p>
<p>• Ancients &amp; Lunar – Speaking of ancients, a player would have to complete our version of the Desert Treasure quest to use Ancient Magiks, and our version of Lunar Diplomacy to use Lunar Magiks.</p>
<p>• Correct Death Emotes – Unlike many servers, when a monster dies, it won’t fold into itself with a bunch of lines going every which way. Also, a players death will be aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>• Full Specs – All special attacks and effects function well, including all Dragon weapons, the Dark bow spec, Godsword specs, the Barrelchest Anchor, and the Barrows Brother’s abilities.</p>
<p>• Skills – We have theiving, fishing, firemaking, woodcutting, runecrafting, agility, crafting, fletching, slayer, mining, smithing, and cooking available to all players!</p>
<p>• Starter – A measly starter will be available to all new players one time, which comes in the form of a package and contains 45K.</p>
<p>• Stable Economy – The prices of items and the availability of gold is balanced well, so this makes for a perfectly stable economy which shouldn’t ever crash. Not to mention the bountiful different methods of making money!</p>
<p>• Shop Area – The shop area contains many different items, from armor to items needed to advance in various skills, and everything in between!</p>
<p>• PvP – There are many ways to show off your dominance in CitruScape. There are team zones, such as the one north of Varrock, solo zones, such as the one north of Edgeville, the Duel Arena in Al-Kharid and the Pk Box.</p>
<p>• Aggressive Monsters – Just like in real RuneScape, certain monsters will attack anyone they come across, so be weary folks!</p>
<p>Some Notes: These plans are in VERY early forms of development, so I still need to figure out a good base. I hope that the members of this community could suggest one. I need a Co-Owner (one who could help me with most or all of these features), two Admins (who could help me with a few of these or more), and a few Mods (who could help me with atleast two of these features).</p>
