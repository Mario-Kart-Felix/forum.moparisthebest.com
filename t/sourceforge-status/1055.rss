    <description>Ok, first let me describe a part of applying to SF

When you apply you need to select a bunch of different &#39;options&#39; like what language is it, what kind of DB does it use, what is it for, what license it should use (I selected GNU/GPL), etc

Well I spent a bunch of time entering all these,(about 10 different sections) and my browser crashed -.-

So when I came back I only entered information for 2 of them (lazy)
So it was Pending for awhile, and when they recieved it they sent back a response saying I didn&#39;t define enough options =/

So I did it ALL OVER AGAIN and resubmited it for review.... wonder what happens =)</description>

<p>The development teams goal is to develop a perfect private online gaming server. To start off we merged two (2) GNU/GPL private servers to create something we call Hybrid. We are now developing from there to create a private server which is easy, clean, and perfect. All of the current private servers have serious exploits that could be used for players to gain an unfair advantage. Our goal is to eliminate all of these flaws, and therefore, make a perfect private gaming server.</p>
