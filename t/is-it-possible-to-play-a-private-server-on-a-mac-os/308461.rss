    <title>Is it possible to play a private server on a Mac OS?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-it-possible-to-play-a-private-server-on-a-mac-os/308461</link>
    <description>It&#39;s a simple question, but i am unsure if it is actually possible to play a private server (using the server&#39;s custom client) on a Mac OS.

It is possible to download the server and extract, i have gotten thus far, but when i go to the run.bat, it says that i do not have an application that is able to run this.

Is there a solution to this problem, or can i simply not play private servers on a mac.</description>
