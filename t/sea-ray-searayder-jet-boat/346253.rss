    <title>Sea Ray SeaRayder Jet Boat</title>

    <description>It&#39;s not a truck or a nice car, but a jet boat.

Have you guys ever checked out the 1994 SeaRayders? I rode in one time and I remember when you crank down on the little jet boat, the front end would just ride in the air.  I can&#39;t remember what year the SeaRayder was but I really want to get one for vacation time before summer ends.  So I was wondering if you know which SeaRayder has this? Where when you crank down the front end is in the air and your pretty much riding vertical! Do you guys know if it was the F-14 1994 Sea Rayder?</description>

              <p>Pretty much any light weight small boat like that is going to take a while to plain out. I wouldn’t recommend getting a jet boat. They’re a heap of work because there running on jetski motors and break often.</p>
