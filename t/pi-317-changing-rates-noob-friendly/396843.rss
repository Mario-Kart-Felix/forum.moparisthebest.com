    <description>So i&#39;ve seen a lot of things asking about how to change rates lately so i am going to tell you how to do it :D


So what you do is go to your source,src,server. Then you will see a notepad in there called Config.java you will want to search for something like this
[code]public static final int MELEE_EXP_RATE = 1000; // damage * exp rate
	public static final int RANGE_EXP_RATE = 1000;
	public static final int MAGIC_EXP_RATE = 1000;[/code]
Now you can change the MELEE RANGE AND MAGIC exp rate to whatever you want. Ex: my servers rate is at 1000, that means for every 1 damage you do it will give you 1,000 exp.
Okay now to change the skills rates
You will want to search for [code]Skill Experience Multipliers[/code]
Something like this will pop up
[code]public static final int WOODCUTTING_EXPERIENCE = 1000;
	public static final int MINING_EXPERIENCE = 1000;
	public static final int SMITHING_EXPERIENCE = 1500;
	public static final int FARMING_EXPERIENCE = 500;
	public static final int FIREMAKING_EXPERIENCE = 1500;
	public static final int HERBLORE_EXPERIENCE = 750;
	public static final int FISHING_EXPERIENCE = 600;
	public static final int AGILITY_EXPERIENCE = 500;
	public static final int PRAYER_EXPERIENCE = 5000;
	public static final int RUNECRAFTING_EXPERIENCE = 250;
	public static final int CRAFTING_EXPERIENCE = 2500;
	public static final int THIEVING_EXPERIENCE = 5000;
	public static final int SLAYER_EXPERIENCE = 200;
	public static final int COOKING_EXPERIENCE = 1000;
	public static final int FLETCHING_EXPERIENCE = 750;[/code]
Change the numbers after the equal signs to make a skill very easy or very hard..
Hope this guide helps you guys :)</description>
