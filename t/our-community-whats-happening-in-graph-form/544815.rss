    <title>Our Community - What&#39;s Happening In Graph Form</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/our-community-whats-happening-in-graph-form/544815</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been a bit bored today so I&#39;ve decided to throw together a few graphs to show where we&#39;re at right now in terms of forum activity. First off, it&#39;s pretty clear that this will be our worst year yet. Anyway, let&#39;s have a look.

[b]New Users 2006-2013[/b]

With this one we can see how strong we started off. This was just around the time private servers were becoming more popular. We had a bit of a spike in 2013 for some reason. Perhaps EoC?

[b]New Users 2013 vs 2014 January - June[/b]

In this one I&#39;ve compared new users for the first 6 months or so of 2013 with the first 6 months of 2014. BLUE = 2013

[b]New Members Overall[/b]

This one here shows the amount of new members over all years. You can see the drop in 2014 pretty easily here.

[b]Posts per year[/b]

This one here shows how many posts we have had each year. 2014 hasn&#39;t finished yet but you can see that we&#39;re not even close.

[b]New Topics For First 6 Months Each Year[/b]

This one shows the amount of topics that were submitted in the first 6 months of each year. This is so we can compare with 2014 which is only half way done.

[b]Sythe Comparisons[/b]

Sythe has been around for a fair while so it&#39;s not really a fair comparison. However, we were always strong on the private server side. We are now a general forum and they are now a black market. Either way, let&#39;s take a look at how large Sythe has come. I&#39;m fairly sure they did a member purge though, so take registered users with a grain of salt.

[b]Gender Difference?[/b]

I hope you&#39;re not looking for a girlfriend. This is a fairly rough graph as there&#39;s no way to tell if people are being truthful about their gender.

[img]http://i.share.pho.to/2618c35f_o.png[/img]

That&#39;s it folks. I can&#39;t be bothered doing anymore. It&#39;s interesting to see how much less activity we&#39;re getting compared to other years. We can also see the difference EoC made on us. If anyone has any ideas on how we can increase our numbers then feel free to chime in. It doesn&#39;t look too good for the forums if we continue down this path.

Also:
- There&#39;s about 6.7 posts per thread.
- The top 10 posters have made around 4.07 percent of all posts on our board.

Enjoy.</description>

              <p>Either way, this forum should really be cleaned up and actually start cracking down on what people say. Moparscape used to be a great place because the discussions were easy to roll with and it wasn’t filled with cliques who hate specific people.</p>
<p>However, even if Tom and everyone decided to take offenses seriously, it would be up to us as community members to be willing to make a change. There’s pretty much a 50-50 chance that most people are going to go ok I guess I can put my annoyance of others aside and act like a real part of the community, or they’re going to go omfg too strict this place sucks. There needs to be a balance where people can voice their own beliefs and have others disagree (RESPECTFULLY) with it, and not get put on watch or receive a warn simply because they don’t agree. If they ever get serious about being universal about punishments then everyone should have their infractions removed and start fresh, then from there pay attention to how people are treating each other.</p>

              <p>ITT: The Web Guy becomes disillusioned and jaded, calls out a bunch of people for apparently horrible behaviour, fails to see that they themselves probably became disillusioned and jaded just like he has albeit a while ago.</p>
<p>The problem with the people who come here asking questions is that they’re talentless hacks who are single-mindedly interested in having their server up and running in five minutes. Everyone else be damned. They don’t search first, they ask the same routine set of questions, they whine about things not working out.<br>
On no occasion will any of them be serious about self-improvement in areas such as software development, networking (not in-depth here, just getting clients talking to servers and servers talking to external clients and databases), configuration management (configuring clients/servers/databases) or whatever else.</p>
<p>That is rightly upsetting to some. Probably including those names you mentioned. At the end of the day, there’s a sense of futility in helping the community’s dregs. What you suggest goes in one ear and out the other unless it can be actioned in five minutes. And god help you if your suggestion involves anything serious such as consulting a piece of academic material such as a book or instruction manual.</p>

You can only teach those that wish to be taught. A majority of these people that get the troll-like responses from most people are those types of people. Please look at the “troll” posts you posted up above, the first three provided exactly what response was required, I’m not going to copy off Google when the OP could simply do it. The 4th one was something that was against the rules in the first place, which is exactly why it was locked. The fourth one was one of my <span class="bbcode-b">very few</span> joke threads, that one was towards RiiPiiN as joke during the most recent presidential election.</p>

              <p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">1.</span>[/size] I am sure if we had better servers to advertise we wouldn’t be hurting so bad. In 2007 I think we were just amazed that Private servers were possible, that we could jump into an emulation of our favorite game and find dust devils sitting in Varrock. But we really never adapted past that. Servers last a couple months then die. Even RS06 didn’t last for long. It seems that our community lacks proper knowledge on successful coding, serious server owners who aren’t looking for cash cows, and unique ideas that will draw new players to our site to check it out.</p>
<p>If anyone hasn’t looked at the advertisement server, I’d suggest checking it out. It’s a cluster fudge of poorly constructed threads looking to give the first 10 people admin powers, or shop servers that claim to have a fudgeing economy. If you look at Rune-Server, they lock your shit if you don’t post media and information. Look at Ukizai, which literally has the same thread on both sites. One site says get some media up or this goes goodbye, and ours still has “Thanks Rune-server!” on it.</p>
<p>Moparscape is a community created by the RSPS scene. I’d highly suggest someone gets some rather strict guidelines on what is necessary for a post to remain on our advertisement section. We have 201 pages of servers, and I can pretty much guarantee about 198 of those are utterly useless and unprofessional.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">2.</span>[/size] Add an Archive section. Anything that has not been posted on or does not have over a specific amount of posts in that time gets archived. If someone wants a thread placed back out of the archive, they message an admin.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">3.</span>[/size] Crack down on everyone being a sarcastic fudge. I get that people can have that personality, but in 90% of our threads someone is just flaming another. There is a very limited amount of regulars that come back to this server, we really should be trying to get along and rather than throwing derogatory terms at each other, face the fact that this is OUR site and pretty much those who stuck around aren’t going to leave. This also means actually paying attention to the shit people on “Watched” say. It’s like the tag is given and then no one gives a flying fudge what they say still.</p>
