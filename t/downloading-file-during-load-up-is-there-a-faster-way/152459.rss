    <title>&quot;downloading file&quot; during load up. is there a faster way?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/downloading-file-during-load-up-is-there-a-faster-way/152459</link>
    <description>Well, I noticed every time I use mopar on a diffrent computer, it requires something to download, and it takes a long time. And since I have dial up at my house, it takes 2 minutes to get 1% and after 5%, the window exited itself. So, I was wondering if it was possable to download that file a diffrent way (like get that link and download it manually) So I could download it at my public library and install it at my house. And If its possable, could someone provide me a way to install it the right way so I wont mess up anything.</description>
