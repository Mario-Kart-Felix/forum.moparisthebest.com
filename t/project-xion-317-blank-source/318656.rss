    <title>[Project Xion] 317 Blank Source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-xion-317-blank-source/318656</link>
    <description>I am Xion from the new Server under Construction called &quot; Xion Scape&quot;. If you need to contact me, my email is: 

[CODE]
MSN: Xion317@live.com
Yahoo: Xion317@yahoo.com
GMail: Xion317@gmail.com
[/CODE]

Ok well, I have been playing RSPS for about 2 years and there all starting to bore me, so I decided to create my own.

For some time now I have been wanting to create the perfect 317 Server that was based on what the User is requesting unlike some servers such as SilabGarza where most of the staff has quit and the server is going to hell, or 2Speced where you never see an In Game Mod or Admin.

I have decided to code a server from a Blank Source such as WinterLove, unlike most servers where they just use a base such as DavidScape or z508.

I have been coding servers for the past 3 months, but I am still not sure on how to Add or Create Models, or how to Host the Server . . . That is why I have created this thread although.

Ok, enough about me and my past experiences though.

I am currently looking for a mature Dedicated Staff that will help the server until the end . . .
Everyone in the team will get a staff spot on the server
