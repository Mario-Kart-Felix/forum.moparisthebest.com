    <description>As anyone who has ever tried to hug their own reflection in a shiny mirror will tell you, mirrors don&#39;t deal well with fingerprints. We found the NX90Jq quickly turned from a shimmering slice of artistic style on our desk into a grubby lump of offensive metal in our oily hands. If you have hyperactive kids who like nothing more than to smear your favourite tech products in jam, you really shouldn&#39;t consider buying this laptop computer. At the pretty least, buy some sort of steel cage to the kids first. Pop a ball in there with them -- they&#39;ll be fine. You may have as much as 8GB of RAM. Our evaluation design had 6GB of DDR3 memory. Completing the ingredient line-up is an Nvidia GeForce GT 555M GPU, that&#39;s in charge of chomping via graphics.  
It takes advantage of a similar unibody design as the some others in the MacBook vary, indicating the chassis has long been made from just one piece of aluminium. That not just final results within a deliciously good-looking device, nevertheless it also makes it noticeably a lot more strong and proof against knocks and bumps than laptops made from several bits and items caught collectively. Design The M17 most likely should not be identified as a notebook, because hauling this beast onto your lap may bring about you actual physical hurt. It measures an infinite 397mm by 299mm by 45mm, that&#39;s somewhere around precisely the same size as two copies of your Yellow pages laid side by side, and weighs a substantial five.4kg. It really is, incredibly, 7 moments heavier compared to the 12-inch Toshiba Portege R500.
