              <p>ok what you need to do is download a sorce from RS2 Server downloads, then go to where you saved your sorce and click compile.</p>
<p>u should get an error like this when u try and compile:</p>
<p><code>'javac' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
Press any key to continue . . .</code></p>
<p>to fix it right click your compile.bat and the go to edit, now copy and paste this over the stuff already there:</p>
<p><code>@echo off
COLOR 8a
title Noobscape Client
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_07\bin\javac.exe" -cp . *.java
"C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_07\bin\java.exe" server
pause</code></p>
<p>now that is done you need to go to runserver.bat and double click it, it activates the server, now open moparscape 3.1 and YOU can access it.</p>
<p>to let over ppl access it you need to open your hamachi, and do exactly what the tutorial says when u open it!!!</p>
<p>ok to let people access it look at the bottom right hand side of hamachi, and u should see 3 dots linked<br>
<img src="http://C:%5CDocuments%20and%20Settings%5CAdministrator%5CMy%20Documents%5CMy%20Pictures%5Chamachi" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>now click it and then go to create new host then add your server name and password.</p>
<p>for other ppl to access it they need to go to join server and type your servername and password.</p>
<p>then when they open moparscape you need to give them the number at the top of ur hamachi, it is the hamachi ip adress, which allows dem to access your server.</p>
<p>then you will have a fully working server</p>
<p>enjoy</p>
<p>(rep++ would be nice)</p>
