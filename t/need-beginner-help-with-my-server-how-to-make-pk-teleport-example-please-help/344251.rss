              <p>for the portforwarding problem once you port forward by getting you defual ip and everything you gota add something also to your fire wall. go to your fire wall and click it open it up on top there should be some tabs click expectations. then click add add a name like RsPrivateServer but the port your using and tpc then add run your server should work =S was my problem. for adding objects you must open your client.java and  serch <code>makeGlobalObject(3226, 3433, 14860, 0, 10);  </code> the first 2 numbers of that code at the x and y location. the 14860 is the object id. the 0 is witch way its facing dont fuck with that. the 10 i still dont know i never change it. changing teleport locatings are in clicking most.java. and chaning names are in text handler. posibley the other way around =S. hope this helps :). next time please post if your using a 317 or w.e and like a delta or w.e</p>
