    <title>In trouble for being more advanced then my ICT teacher</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/in-trouble-for-being-more-advanced-then-my-ict-teacher/345469</link>
    <description>So i went school a couple days back to find out in ICT (Computing for short) i had a evaluation (sorta like a test/essay); so i got to work and started answering the question, now i aint the cleverest guy and i admit it but the next bit is fucked up.

The second question was &quot;what forms does information come in&quot;; now i thought back when my teacher told me: images, text and numerals are all types of this, so i typed something similar to the extract below; brackets were not in the extract it self.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Information may come in various different forms, including Integers (as numbers); which come in forms of upto 128bit; an average 32bit Integer which is signed can hold up to the range of &#39;-2,147,483,647 - 2,147,483,648&#39; (maybe the other way around lol); information may also come in graphics such as bitmap or vector and finally information may come in &#39;strings&#39; or for short &#39;text&#39;&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now i know there are countless errors in this proberly but then the guy said this to me;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is not your work; you clearly copy + pasted it. Delete this now or explain to me what 32bit is&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I know what it is but its sorta hard to explain when your in pressure; then he arranged me to meet the headteacher (principal), gave me an [b]F[/b] and kicked me out the class.

I have countless witnesses that i didnt c + p anything but his an fuckhead, i have an meeting with the headteacher soon, i have no idea what to tell her.

any thoughts?</description>

              <p>So i went school a couple days back to find out in ICT (Computing for short) i had a evaluation (sorta like a test/essay); so i got to work and started answering the question, now i aint the cleverest guy and i admit it but the next bit is fucked up.</p>
<p>The second question was “what forms does information come in”; now i thought back when my teacher told me: images, text and numerals are all types of this, so i typed something similar to the extract below; brackets were not in the extract it self.</p>
<blockquote>"Information may come in various different forms, including Integers (as numbers); which come in forms of upto 128bit; an average 32bit Integer which is signed can hold up to the range of '-2,147,483,647 - 2,147,483,648' (maybe the other way around lol); information may also come in graphics such as bitmap or vector and finally information may come in 'strings' or for short 'text'"</blockquote>
<p>Now i know there are countless errors in this proberly but then the guy said this to me;</p>
<blockquote>This is not your work; you clearly copy + pasted it. Delete this now or explain to me what 32bit is</blockquote>
<p>I know what it is but its sorta hard to explain when your in pressure; then he arranged me to meet the headteacher (principal), gave me an <span class="bbcode-b">F</span> and kicked me out the class.</p>
<p>I have countless witnesses that i didnt c + p anything but his an fuckhead, i have an meeting with the headteacher soon, i have no idea what to tell her.</p>
<p>any thoughts?</p>
