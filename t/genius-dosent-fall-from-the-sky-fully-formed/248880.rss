    <description>I&#39;ve been around the RS community a long time. Longer than the overwhelming majority of you, although I know there are people here who&#39;ve been around longer (Hi Med, if you bother with the forums). Wanna know why this community produces nothing in comparison to the communities of old? &quot;We&quot; actively repress it.

http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,327573.0.html
http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,327913.0.html

Not the best examples in the slightest, just three I picked in a couple seconds, I&#39;m far too lazy to find the ones I remember. These are relatively well-written posts, showing understanding of programming and/or cheating techniques. They are not &quot;how do I run rsbot&quot;. They are not &quot;this scar script gave me an error&quot;. They are posts from potential cheat developers honing their skills and in some cases attempting to pass on those skills to others.

You may consider those skills useless, or not skills at all. However, you are not everyone and in most cases you are just an outspoken minority. You, the outspoken minority, are the same people who complain that the new people are not learning and that knowledge is hoarded. You raise the barrier to entry to RS cheating to unimaginable levels. It&#39;s fine to say &quot;well if they had balls they&#39;d look past it and soldier on&quot; or whatever, but some people don&#39;t want to put up with that bullshit to engage in something they enjoy... Your hypocrisy is precisely the cause of what you claim is wrong with this community.</description>

              <p>After thinking about it for a while, I rest my case. Although elitism is what ruins this community for newcomers, it’s also that what keeps it together. It’s the small group of active members, that keep this forum alive. It’s that group, that sticks up for each other, and flames those not worthy and annoying.</p>
<p>Remove the elite, and you might aswell delete the whole community.</p>

<p>I don’t know about all this nonsense; knowledge is free, the only difficult challenge in Runescape cheating is making a decision on what kind of cheat you want and discovering whether  or not it is possible. Making it is a matter of perseverance and determination, once it has been proven possible. No matter what shenanigans are attempted to hide this basic fact it remains. You get what you give. Doing something yourself is the best way to do it; therefore this community provides a guide not to those deemed worthy by the imaginary “Elite” but to those who challenge themselves to create new things and ask for help in the forthright and becoming way which is natural to those whose goal is not getting attention or seeking self-satisfaction.<br>

              <p>I find it a bit ironic that elitism suddenly becomes a huge problem nearly a year after this community was really in the shits. If you look back on this board back to last year, you will see what I am talking about. This community has, if anything, improved since last year. The only downfall to this ‘improvement’ is loss of productivity and thus activity to this site.</p>
<p>It sounds like a good thing to bring about this whole elitism problem from our minds to our eyes, but what can you do to prevent/stop it? As far as I can see, nothing can stop human arrogance other than the human them self. Perhaps by changing the community to shun their backs upon people who practice elitism, the elitism may eventually be driven out of the person. However, changing people is wrong and should never be attempted.</p>
<p>And about the whole frank_ matter, that is all utter crap. Frank_ has done more for the community than most have, even if you don’t want to believe it. His criticism is nearly always constructive, despite the vulgar manner it sometimes comes in. If you find what frank_ says to be insulting, then you are being ignorant of the fact he was one of the most intelligent people here and has full right to point out what you did wrong. If you really can’t handle the things he says, then don’t post your projects here.</p>

I totally agree with you Mopman, if I wanted to learn stuff, I would have clicked thoose threads and learnt by how good it is/why there is errors etc.</p>
<p>People, remember:<br>
Encourage don’t discourage.</p>
<p>[/quote]so you wish to read misleading and incorrect tutorials so that you may deduce why they are wrong? good luck with that[/quote]<br>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitism" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Elitism</a></h3>

<p>Elitism is the belief or attitude that individuals who form an elite — a select group of people with a certain ancestry, intrinsic quality, high intellect, wealth, special skills, or experience — are more likely to be constructive to society as a whole, and therefore deserve influence or authority greater than that of others. In the United States, the term elitism often refers to the concentration of power in the Northeast Corridor and on the West Coast, where the typical American elite resides –...</p>

<p>Basically the only active members here our elitists.</p>
<p>I think people returning to the scene after just a year or two our surprised by what its turned into. As far back as just a one year things seemed a lot different, a reply to one of the threads stated in your post Mopman would have been productive, and the person who had originally posted say, his code for opinions on how it was going would have received a generally warm reception on how to improve this and that.</p>
<p>Now however, you get productive answers still, yes. But they generally go along the lines of “gtfo this forum and never come back you fuckin idiot”. How our the new people going to learn how to client hack, etc if they are not taught? The next generation of coders will not be existent, the old school coders will surely have grown out of runescape. The reason we’re mostly brought here will be diminished in the coming years, after lasting sooo long. It would be a shame to perhaps come back here after a few years of doing the ‘adult’ things of life to discover nothing has progressed.</p>
<p>I have to say, I don’t blame the flaming in most instances, as it does also include what’s wrong. However, if the harsh words where to be replaced with not only what’s wrong, but how to correct this. In the end it would result in much better out-comes then just making yet another person leave.</p>

<p>I have never once seen frank_ post on a thread that had even a hint of potential, in a horrific manner.</p>
<p>Perhaps he may say “It Sucks.”, but that doesn’t make him a bad person, it makes him brutally honest.  Even so, on most threads where potential and effort were put forward, he usually posts a reason why it “sucks”.</p>
<p>He and I may not always see eye-to-eye, but that doesn’t mean I go around saying that the falls of this community are because of people like him and mostly him.  You shouldn’t either.</p>
