    <title>(Runesource) Runefocus V2 Woodcuting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runesource-runefocus-v2-woodcuting/457016</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m fairly new to programming runescape private servers and I decided to start my first project in order to get the hang of things.  I decided to use runesource as the base because it is quite empty and I feel like there is a lot that can be added and improved.  So, I downloaded Runefocus v2 by I Roll Deep and I looked through the skills classes.  I decided to test each skill.  Woodcutting does not seem to work even though it was written in.  Does anybody who tried the source have an explanation for this?  The closest answer I came to was that the equipable items Id&#39;s aren&#39;t supported which wouldn&#39;t allow the source to recognize any of the axes required to start woodcutting.  Here&#39;s a link to the source: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,526500.msg3835214.html#msg3835214</description>

              <p>If you’re just starting out, you really shouldn’t jump into something like RuneSource. Try something simple and basic like Allstar-Scape or a DeltaScape of the sorts.</p>
