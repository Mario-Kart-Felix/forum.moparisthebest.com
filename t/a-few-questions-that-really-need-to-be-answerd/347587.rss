    <title>A few questions that really need to be answerd</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions-that-really-need-to-be-answerd/347587</link>
    <description>Alright guys I have a few quick (maybe not so quick questions)

Q1: How can I encrypt my client so that other people can&#39;t rip it, but they can sitll play it?

Q2: How can I add world maps to places like Ardougne and the Gnome village, and where do I get them from?

Q3: How can I clip firemaking? Its driving me crazy....

Any help would be really appreciated, should I post this in the client help section instead?

Thanks,</description>

              <p>q1: i don’t think you can completely do that because they’ll probably be agble to decrypt it anyways, but first delete your .java files (after compiling of course) and hide the files and that’s all i know. you should ask this on client help though as all your questions are client related.</p>
