              <p>I’m not sure if Jagex still does this, but in the pre-503 era, they had something called the “JAGGRAB” protocol, which basically compared the current cache files with ones on the server, and if there was a mismatch, it sent back the correct files.</p>
<p>I believe Hyperion has one with it.</p>
