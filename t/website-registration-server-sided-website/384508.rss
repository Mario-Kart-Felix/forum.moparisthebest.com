    <description>Hello guys,

Does anyone has a tutorial that people only can log in when they register at the forums?

Best of thanks,

That would limit it to 2 accounts per person.</p>

<p>You need to connect to your forum database using JDBC, assuming you run your server on the same host as your forums (or have remote database access to your forum host). There are plenty of tutorials and examples on JDBC.</p>
<p>When a user attempts to login, run a query which searches for a user with this username+password. If you’re using SMF, I can give you the query.</p>
