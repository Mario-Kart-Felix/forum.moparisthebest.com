<p>I’m in Public school, and I didn’t say everyone. Our school gives out a practice SAT test for Freshman, Sophomores and Juniors to take. I’m a freshman, and got a 1570. Yes, that’s a shitty score, but I’m a freshman. However, on a little chart on the side, I scored better then 74% of <span class="bbcode-b">sophomores</span>. I also hadn’t taken English or Math yet. Again, further proof of how many idiots there are.</p>

<p>I cruise through all of my classes and stay at like a b average then when it comes to the last like 2 weeks I try and get it up to an A.

        <p>Lol in computer class, there was this one dude next to me, his name was Nazar, (lol) and so when he left to ask the teacher something, i would hit his keyboard and it would bounce up and down, because the keyboards stands were up, so every day for like 3 weeks i would do that, then one day i hit it so hard, the stands broke, and the space bar stopped working, and half the keyboard, then i thought “I’m on Nazar’s computer, bashin his keyboard” (Lolcats reference)</p>

Lol in computer class, there was this one dude next to me, his name was Nazar, (lol) and so when he left to ask the teacher something, i would hit his keyboard and it would bounce up and down, because the keyboards stands were up, so every day for like 3 weeks i would do that, then one day i hit it so hard, the stands broke, and the space bar stopped working, and half the keyboard, then i thought “I’m on Nazar’s computer, bashin his keyboard” (Lolcats reference)</p>
<p>It was hilarious though, and especially since i never got caught.<br>
[/quote]<br>
You shoulda unplugged his keyboard. That’s what I did to my friend. He was like “Why the hell isn’t my keyboard working?! Is it broken?!” :’)[/quote]<br>
Ive done that at least 6 times to him rofl</p>
<p>“Hes like wtf why doesnt my keyboard work? <em>Looks at me</em> I bet it was you faggot”</p>
<p>He exits our computer row to go to the back of the computer to check if its plugged in</p>
<p>And i bash his keyboard while he goes lol.</p>
<p>And once i deleted all his browser shortcuts (Mozilla, IE, and Chrome) and he doesnt know shit about comps so hes “WHY CANT I GO ON THE INTERNET”</p>
<p>Those are his exact words.</p>

<p>We have an English teacher that has Parkinson’s Disease.

Just a few things they do:</p>
<p>-Put onions or some type of food that will rot inside the air vent in her room.<br>
-Hide her car keys so she has to drive the school bus home to get a spare or have her husband pick her up.<br>
-Unplug mouse/keyboard<br>

-Steal test papers to cheat on them (although most people have gotten caught)</p>
<p>This teacher is a fucking genius in English though, she has high degrees in several English courses and she wrote a pep grant for our school that gives us $750,000 over the course of 4 years or something to build a new workout center for our gigantic school of 250 kids.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> We have to do a ton of testing for it though and it’s annoying!</p>

<p>I wish, but unfortunately is has to be used for anything related to Physical Education. Students are also required to have testing done every so often, such as a pedometer recording log for a week or something…and yeah, 750 grand over the course of  4 years or somewhere around that time.</p>

<p>Basically a few rooms of our school were wiped out and made into one large room. We are going to have a shit load of equipment such as lifting machines and weights put in there. It will also replace our old P.E. equipment, etc. Our school has 250 kids which is why it is kind of funny, but then again it will be open to anyone in our community/close-by, and I am sure with the amount of jocks and sports freaks in our school, it won’t go unused.</p>

<p>Wow, funny you should bring this subject up. Someone from our school a few weeks ago was caught popping out keys and messing around with them, ended up having several new rules added just for computers:</p>
<p>1)If you have a D+ or below in a class you are not allowed to use computers.<br>
2)If you MUST use a computer for the class you are failing, you need a written pass from the teacher who teaches that class saying specifically what the computer needs to be used for.</p>
<p>Our school is so fucking strict. These didn’t effect me but in reality our school board thinks we are still in 5th grade.</p>

<p>I’m in Public school, and I didn’t say everyone. Our school gives out a practice SAT test for Freshman, Sophomores and Juniors to take. I’m a freshman, and got a 1570. Yes, that’s a shitty score, but I’m a freshman. However, on a little chart on the side, I scored better then 74% of <span class="bbcode-b">sophomores</span>. I also hadn’t taken English or Math yet. Again, further proof of how many idiots there are.[/quote]<br>
Hehe, I got a 1970 as a freshman. Sadly, I did horribly on my real SAT’s relative to my score as a freshman. -.-</p>
