    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fun-with-keyboard/384476</link>
    <description>So I was bored in English. Found out you can pop the keys out. This is what I did. Thinking about making the keys alphabetical instead...

<p>Wow, funny you should bring this subject up. Someone from our school a few weeks ago was caught popping out keys and messing around with them, ended up having several new rules added just for computers:</p>
<p>1)If you have a D+ or below in a class you are not allowed to use computers.<br>
2)If you MUST use a computer for the class you are failing, you need a written pass from the teacher who teaches that class saying specifically what the computer needs to be used for.</p>

<p>I’m in Public school, and I didn’t say everyone. Our school gives out a practice SAT test for Freshman, Sophomores and Juniors to take. I’m a freshman, and got a 1570.

Hehe, I got a 1970 as a freshman. Sadly, I did horribly on my real SAT’s relative to my score as a freshman. -.-</p>

<p>Basically a few rooms of our school were wiped out and made into one large room. We are going to have a shit load of equipment such as lifting machines and weights put in there. It will also replace our old P.E. equipment, etc. Our school has 250 kids which is why it is kind of funny, but then again it will be open to anyone in our community/close-by, and I am sure with the amount of jocks and sports freaks in our school, it won’t go unused.</p>

<p>I wish, but unfortunately is has to be used for anything related to Physical Education. Students are also required to have testing done every so often, such as a pedometer recording log for a week or something…and yeah, 750 grand over the course of  4 years or somewhere around that time.</p>

<p>We have an English teacher that has Parkinson’s Disease.

Just a few things they do:</p>
<p>-Put onions or some type of food that will rot inside the air vent in her room.<br>
-Hide her car keys so she has to drive the school bus home to get a spare or have her husband pick her up.<br>
-Unplug mouse/keyboard<br>
-Draw genitalia on posters, desks, etc.<br>
-Steal test papers to cheat on them (although most people have gotten caught)</p>
<p>This teacher is a fucking genius in English though, she has high degrees in several English courses and she wrote a pep grant for our school that gives us $750,000 over the course of 4 years or something to build a new workout center for our gigantic school of 250 kids.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> We have to do a ton of testing for it though and it’s annoying!<br>

I’m in Public school, and I didn’t say everyone. Our school gives out a practice SAT test for Freshman, Sophomores and Juniors to take. I’m a freshman, and got a 1570. Yes, that’s a shitty score, but I’m a freshman. However, on a little chart on the side, I scored better then 74% of <span class="bbcode-b">sophomores</span>. I also hadn’t taken English or Math yet. Again, further proof of how many idiots there are.<br>

<p>I’m not really sure if it’s intelligence, it’s laziness. I am sure that if the kids in my school weren’t so lazy we would be much higher on the ranks. There is really no reason to be getting below a C in a class. The only way to do that here is not do any homework at all and completely just bomb every test. I can definitely agree with immaturity though.</p>

<p>Lol in computer class, there was this one dude next to me, his name was Nazar, (lol) and so when he left to ask the teacher something, i would hit his keyboard and it would bounce up and down, because the keyboards stands were up, so every day for like 3 weeks i would do that, then one day i hit it so hard, the stands broke, and the space bar stopped working, and half the keyboard, then i thought “I’m on Nazar’s computer, bashin his keyboard” (Lolcats reference)</p>
<p>It was hilarious though, and especially since i never got caught.</p>

<p>We have an English teacher that has Parkinson’s Disease. A lot of people mess around with her by unplugging her mouse, stealing her keys, etc. It was funny but some of the shit they do is ridiculous, which is why I can also follow what reyx7 said about public schools containing a lot of immature retards. Just a few things they do:</p>
<p>-Put onions or some type of food that will rot inside the air vent in her room.<br>
-Hide her car keys so she has to drive the school bus home to get a spare or have her husband pick her up.<br>
-Unplug mouse/keyboard<br>
-Draw genitalia on posters, desks, etc.<br>
-Steal test papers to cheat on them (although most people have gotten caught)</p>
<p>This teacher is a fucking genius in English though, she has high degrees in several English courses and she wrote a pep grant for our school that gives us $750,000 over the course of 4 years or something to build a new workout center for our gigantic school of 250 kids.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> We have to do a ton of testing for it though and it’s annoying![/quote]<br>
Teachers like that should teach AP or honors only… saddens me.</p>

I’m in Public school, and I didn’t say everyone. Our school gives out a practice SAT test for Freshman, Sophomores and Juniors to take. I’m a freshman, and got a 1570. Yes, that’s a shitty score, but I’m a freshman. However, on a little chart on the side, I scored better then 74% of <span class="bbcode-b">sophomores</span>. I also hadn’t taken English or Math yet. Again, further proof of how many idiots there are.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I cruise through all of my classes and stay at like a b average then when it comes to the last like 2 weeks I try and get it up to an A. School bores me… Wish they taught me something I didn’t know already or was difficult to understand that I wanted to learn. Only thing I can’t seem to understand is genetics… So I sleep/goof off in most of my classes.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m normally a mix student, with a C, B’s and A’s. This quarter, however, I currently have 3 A’s and a B. the B is like an 83%, idk if I can get 7% in 5 weeks. gah.</p>

<p>1)If you have a D+ or below in a class you are not allowed to use computers.<br>
2)If you MUST use a computer for the class you are failing, you need a written pass from the teacher who teaches that class saying specifically what the computer needs to be used for.</p>
<p>Our school is so fucking strict. These didn’t effect me but in reality our school board thinks we are still in 5th grade.[/quote]</p>
<p>Further proof that public schools are filled with immature retards.</p>

<p>I bet that was a bitch to type then. Ive adapted my own style of typing involving the index and middle finger, sometimes the ring finger, and I can normally do 65 wpm +, 75 is average, 65 with a lot of typos.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>i use all my fingers, but my hands are all over the place. its kind of close to how you are suppose to type except i look at the keyboard every now and then.</p>

<p>I once went round a room and removed the A key from every single keyboard, and placed them all onto one so the only letter to be seen was the letter A, teachers weren’t amused.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This I thought about doing. But sadly the teachers would see me walking around the room going to each computer wondering what I was doing. Also I put the keys in alphabetical order today. Sorry if the picture quality isn’t great. Had to take the picture underneath our computer workstations.<br>

<p>GQE kids are the kids who failed the core 40 and are basically taking middle school classes in high school. So they probably type by chicken pecking.<br>

<p>GQE = graduation qualifying exam… <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBQQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.learnmoreindiana.org%2Fcounselors%2Fhighschool%2FAcademicGuidance%2FPages%2FISTEP%2BandGQE.aspx&amp;ei=QkxtTa2DGYnEvQOd9bC-BA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVemVf4ATOm-cuzxWpLTyXg-ppsQ&amp;sig2=KU5rIpMS6WzgBVi7iEhDpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBQQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.learnmoreindiana.org%2Fcounselors%2Fhighschool%2FAcademicGuidance%2FPages%2FISTEP%2BandGQE.aspx&amp;ei=QkxtTa2DGYnEvQOd9bC-BA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVemVf4ATOm-cuzxWpLTyXg-ppsQ&amp;sig2=KU5rIpMS6WzgBVi7iEhDpg</a> which means you have to pass that to graduate hs. not you take it if u fail the core 40. the core 40 is a set of standards for a diploma “better” than the standard hs diploma. and core 40 means you take college prep classes as opposed to normal high school classes. which i didnt pass the english part of the gqe the first time by like 4 points, not a surprise since i hate english. i past math by like 200 points. the requirements to pass change every year so if your class(all the students in you grade through the state) is better than you in school the chance is you aren’t going to pass. so ur from indiana?  anyways i chicken peck, i just cant type thru the standard way my hands just dont do that. ive had 3 keyboarding classes, and am still not able to type like 70+ gwam. 40 max on a good day.[/quote]<br>
I would never know really what it stands for as I have an excellent memory. All school really is, is a memory test. Except for math, that’s logic. Unless you like memorizing all of those equations. Just remember that the people that came up with those equations used logic to figure out an equation. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
