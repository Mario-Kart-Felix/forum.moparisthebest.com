              <p>Oh ok thanks.  For a second there you had me confused.  I thought that you were Wizzup? but just had your name changed here, and was wondering why you were a g-mod and active here and why you were talking to me like that lol.</p>
<p>Thanks for that info though.</p>

              <p>Hello, user of the SRL Forums.<br>
The SRL-Forums are currently down, as you have probably noticed.<br>
When the weekend is over, WT-Fakawi and I (Wizzup?) will contact SRL-Forums’ hosting company, knownhost.<br>
We will first try to get SRL back up, and then will probably try to take over the hosting of SRL again.<br>
(We did host it at the very start, remember?)</p>
<p>If this should somehow fail, don’t worry, SRL-Forums won’t die.<br>
The only upcoming problems might be getting the database back, if we can’t contact Dankness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is not much we can do. I just hope this problem will be resolved soon.</p>
<p>I hope to see all you guys on the SRL IRC, <span class="hashtag">#srl</span> at <a href="http://freenode.net" rel="nofollow noopener">freenode.net</a>…<br>
I’ll be there most of the time, and you can always ask questions on the latest status of SRL-Forums.</p>
<p>Wizzup</p>
<p>PS: It would be nice if you could distribute this link to the SRL Members/Users you know. (That you have on MSN, ICQ etc)<br>
