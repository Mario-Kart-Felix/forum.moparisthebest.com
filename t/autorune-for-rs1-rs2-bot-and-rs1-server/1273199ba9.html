<p>I block AdSense ads. So do a vast majority of forum users. AdSense also pays per 1000(0) impressions.</p>
<p>Maybe he has realised that he would make much more money actually giving people something worth there money.</p>

<p>Not everyone blocks adsense ads.  One day, my website got 668 hits and 21 clicks.  Adsense gave me $4.45 right there.  Let’s just take Mopar’s site as an example.  He has 150k members.  Let’s say each member made only one page impression.  Thats roughly 4715 ad-clicks, scaling up from the numbers on my site (in actuality it would be much much more because people like me make thousands of page impressions).  That gives Mopar $1000 right there from Adsense.  A lot of factors influence this, but I gave you the minimum possible amount Mopar made from his site.  I’m pretty sure Kait made thousand<span class="bbcode-b">s</span>.  My site got 21 clicks / 668 hits while it was a flash hacking page, so the demographics would be heavily skewed towards users with experience with computers (therefore the majority would have an ad-blocking program).  Kait and Mopar get leechers and noobs who don’t know the difference between Windows and Internet Explorer (therefore they don’t have adblock).  So don’t talk out of your ass.</p>
<p>And no, the amount of work involved in scamming is much less than actually making something real.</p>

<p>Oh, so all of a sudden he actually <span class="bbcode-b">does</span> want to work?</p>
<p>And seriously learn how to read.  I said in total, Mopar made $1000 at the unreasonable minimum.  Therefore it is completely likely for Kaitnieks to have made thousands.  Plural.  You were wrong, get over it.  And some quick cash?  $500?  He has a family and a job, why would he want some quick cash?  Get a job, maybe you’ll realize how little that would be.  Simply not worth screwing over hundreds of nubs.</p>
<p>And I challenge you to name one fact I provided that was pointless and irrelevant.  Get your head out of your ass and into the world.</p>

So all of a sudden Josh doesn’t want to work?</p>
<p>You are truly an idiot. What is Kaitnieks didn’t want to set up his site again? What if he just wanted a bit of quick cash?<br>
You’re also telling me that Mopar makes $1000 a day from AdSense? About 3,000 people make page impressions a day on this site.</p>
<p>You’re throwing out all these pointless facts that have no relevance to the threads subject, so it’s my turn to tell you to stop talking out of your arse, as frankly, I couldn’t care less whether Kaits is doing it for money or doing it for a deal.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh, so all of a sudden he actually <span class="bbcode-b">does</span> want to work?</p>
<p>And seriously learn how to read.  I said in total, Mopar made $1000 at the unreasonable minimum.  Therefore it is completely likely for Kaitnieks to have made thousands.  Plural.  You were wrong, get over it.  And some quick cash?  $500?  He has a family and a job, why would he want some quick cash?  Get a job, maybe you’ll realize how little that would be.  Simply not worth screwing over hundreds of nubs.</p>
<p>And I challenge you to name one fact I provided that was pointless and irrelevant.  Get your head out of your ass and into the world.[/quote]</p>
<p>You have to be the most arrogant person I have ever met. You need to start seeing sense.</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t he want to make a quick $500 for 3 lines of text? You think that Kaits is some god. He isn’t. He wants and needs money just like the rest of us, actually. $500 is little money now? That’s about £250 which isn’t exactly a small amount of money. Or are you just a spoilt little twat? I think you must be with the attitude you have. No one knows whether this is a scam or it isn’t. Until I see some firm evidence that this is a scam then I see no reason that Kaits can’t take cash for the link.</p>
<p>All of what you stated was irrelevant. Have a quick peek at the topic title, and then tell me what ‘This is what AdSense pays Mopar’ has anything to with it.</p>

You have to be the most arrogant person I have ever met. You need to start seeing sense.</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t he want to make a quick $500 for 3 lines of text? You think that Kaits is some god. He isn’t. He wants and needs money just like the rest of us, actually. $500 is little money now? That’s about £250 which isn’t exactly a small amount of money. Or are you just a spoilt little twat? I think you must be with the attitude you have. No one knows whether this is a scam or it isn’t. Until I see some firm evidence that this is a scam then I see no reason that Kaits can’t take cash for the link.</p>

<p>Ah this is such fun. Let me just brew a cup of tea so I can, again, prove you are indeed an idiot.</p>
<p>I’ll break it down for you, sentence by sentence.</p>
<blockquote>I know I wouldn't steal $500 unless it's out of some asshole corporation's pocket.</blockquote>
Who said anything about stealing $500? I think it's just you making up things so you dont look like such an idiot.
<blockquote>Oh wow, $500 = £250, you sure convinced me.</blockquote>
I sure convinced you what? Are you so seriously arrogant as to say you wouldn't take £250 for a bot that, as far as you know, exists? No, your not. And if you are, you're only saying that so you can carry on arguing with me.
<blockquote>Oh wait.  Hold on.  No, you didn't, fucktard.</blockquote>
Man you have attitude problems. Judging by your complete immaturity, I can say your about 13-16 and you think your the dogs bollucks round here. Only a few more years before you have to stop acting like a little brat for you.
<blockquote>Seriously grow some balls and get a job before you decide you would step out of your ethics and screw over little kids just to get a bit of cash.</blockquote>
As I stated in my previous post, I have a job. Another 'insult' directed at me. Boy, you sure are shaping up to be the mature one round here. I don't think Kaits in screwing any kids over. Raw is screwing them over. He's just a middleman who isn't taking any part in the whole thing. 
<blockquote>RaW is doing this.  What do you have to disprove it?</blockquote>
Yeh, I did ask for some firm evidence this exists. I never said I had evidence to disprove, but then again the free trials and the pictures surly could for something. Maybe not evidence but something.
<blockquote>All of what I said was completely relevant.  You said Kait never had his forums up for money.  I proved you wrong.</blockquote>
It really wasn't. For a start, you think Kaitnieks has his forums up for money? You obviously weren't around during the Aryan days. Also, don't talk shit to make your dick look big. You never proved me wrong at anything.
<blockquote>You said Adsense pays per 1000 clicks.</blockquote>
Actually, I said AdSense also pays per 1000(0) page impressions. Not clicks. Learn to read a whole post or at least understand what is being said before bitching about it.
<blockquote>You said a vast majority of forum users block ads.  I showed how you were mistaken.</blockquote>
Yup. I did say that. You never showed me you were mistaken. You told me you got 21 clicks on day. Lucky you! A whole 21 people clicked an add that generated $0.20 for you? You're a big boy now. Go spend it on some sweets.
<blockquote>And to push the point even further, take a look at this thread.</blockquote>
I never normally say this but 'LOL'. That isn't evidence. The survey was so small, it couldn't even be considered RELEVANT TO THIS TOPIC. 
Relevancy - The degree to which a document or Web page provides the information the user is looking for, in terms of user needs.
Wake up call. No one gives a shit how much you, or mopar make per day, which happens to be a whole $4 for you!! Well done!
<blockquote>Judging by the disclaimer on Kait's site, he is clearly skeptical of AR2's existence.</blockquote>
He would be wrong not to be skeptical. 
<blockquote>At any rate, you are the one who seems to think Kait is a god.  Your reasoning is, 'If Kait looked at it and saw that it's ok, then it must be ok.'  You're taking for granted the fact that Kait will be truthful.  I'm the one who is saying this is probably a scam, though I'm trying to figure out Kait's motive for putting it on the site.</blockquote>
lulwut? 
I can even begin to talk about the mouthful of bullshit.
If Kaitnieks looked at it, and saw it is ok, I would take his word for it. Why? Because there's no reason not to take his word for it. I don't remember Kaitnieks ever giving out false information, and I would trust Kaits over any member on this forum besides a select few. 
Kaits motive has already been told. Yet again, you're too far up your own arse to read what anyone else has to say. Instead, you must be right all the time. 
Kaitnieks doesn't need a motive. As Starblaster said, he is keeping up to his end of a deal. As Freddy1990 has said in numerous chat logs, he is doing it for his end of a deal. End of. No maybe, you will stop posting when you realize you're talking a load of shit.

Kait has to hold his side of the deal, so he put it on his site.<br>
kthxbi<br>

<p>What deal.</p>
<p>kthxdi.[/quote]</p>
<p>The deal that Kaitnieks had with Raw. Starblaster has already said that Kaits didn’t tell him what the deal was, but there was one.<br>
Also, don’t do that kthxbi like you think people will think you’re cool. As I said, you think you’re the dog bollucks, when really, you’re just a really funny kid.</p>

<p>Yes, please direct me to the previous post of yours that states you have a job.  Regardless, the remark was directed to point out your lack of experience in these matters.  If it ends up affecting you, then would be your problem, now wouldn’t it?  And if RaW is indeed scamming, then Kait clearly knows about it.  All the Admins and Mods know it, and Kait, in full knowledge, fails to provide any evidence otherwise.  In fact, he actually states that he can<span class="bbcode-b">not</span> verify the authenticity of this new AR2.  He knows he is a middleman, because, in anticipation, he attempts to indemnify himself against the consequences of RaW’s forthcoming scam.</p>

<p>Yes, I, for one, actually read the entire thread before jumping in.  I read Starblaster’s post, thank you for your unnecessarily patronizing remark.  Exe26 unnecessarily reposted the fact that Kait had a ‘deal’ with RaW, and therefore I asked him to provide more information, which he obviously didn’t have, rendering that post ‘pointless.’  By the way, you should quote exe26 about the kthxbi statement instead of me, considering I didn’t even say kthxbi.</p>
