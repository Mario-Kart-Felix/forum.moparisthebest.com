    <description>ok i looked on http://kaitnieks.com/ and it links you to a different website, do not go to it, from the comments on this post it is obvious he is a scammer, people have said that he has scammed over $1k before, so why trust him this time? and it has a trojan in it or some crap like that</description>

              <p>Words from a person who has been part of TARC since 2002-2003</p>
<p>Yes, he has scammed…alot.</p>
<p>He legitimately bought the AutoRune source code from Kaitnieks. He then continued to get it updated, along with RuneBot. Rune Bot was origonally created by Vee, i’m not sure if it was open source, if he snagged the source, or if he bought it, or just got permission from Vee. He got Evo to update AutoRune and Runebot. Evo also devoliped a very private bot that was very very powerful(The strongest java bot to ever hit RSC, don’t try to argue that if you never used it. The scripting engine was very well devoliped, very fast, very stable.)He then got Evo to devolip ShellBot, my favorite bot. Shellbot was a program that, through telnet and command prompt, would run on a remote server(Evo had one set up for everybody to use) and run IX bot with as many chars as you wanted. You could have these bots go on a time line, trade in and out with each other to keep certain time intervals. It was amazing. Soon after this RaW promised AutoRune 2(Autorune for RS2). He accepted advance payments for the program, and never delivered. So he scammed alot of people money, alot. Before that he did some scamming here and there but nothing of that scale. I think AR2 came back for another appearance i believe their was another scam.</p>
<p>This time around he has had AutoRune updated for RSC and it fully works, he also had(what he calls) ix bot updated, but i’m not sure because it doesn’t have any of the power that IX bot did. He has screen shots of his Rs2 bot but nobody has tested it or can vouche for it besides josh.</p>
<p>The forum server is down because “its moving servers”. I’ve been told, by a reliable source, that the forum was reported for Bulleton theft(The forum software was apparently a stolen version). Hes been gone for a week now so i’m not quite sure what to make of it. He hasn’t sold any versions of Autorune so he hasn’t scammed or anything. I’m not quite sure what to make of it, i’ve always been friends with RaW and hes an allright guy, besides the scamming of course.</p>
<p>And believe me, he has enough money on his own to do what he wants without scamming. At the moment he has “paki” programmers working on the main part of updating AutoRune, devoliping AR2, and in the future(if he carries on) developing his Runescape classic server. Which, by the way AutoRune was updated i think the Rsc private server could go leaps and bounds ahead of even reins’.</p>
<p>But in the end its up to josh and what he wants to do. In the end, its your decision weather or not you give him your money. But if you’re cautious, wait till somebody else does it to make sure.</p>

<p>He has released a working version of AR for RSC to gain people’s trust.<br>
However, when it comes to RS2, i think nothing will work.  RSC is much easier to manipulate (or so Taios has told me :p) so i reckon when AR comes out for RS2 it wont do anything at all.</p>

Simple solution:<br>
Kait has to hold his side of the deal, so he put it on his site.<br>
kthxbi<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>What deal.</p>
<p>kthxdi.[/quote]</p>
<p>I can’t believe what a stupid thread this has turned into.</p>
<p>Its simple. When Kaits sold AutoRune to RaW, RaW made him agree that if his website was to close down, Kaitnieks was to redirect all of his forum members to RaWs website.</p>
<p>Thats the deal. Nothing more.  As i have said before, <span class="bbcode-i">he is simply holding up his end of the bargain</span></p>
<p>There maybe money involved, we do not know.  However, Kaitnieks gets more than enough money from his current job.  He does not need any from RaW, nor a <span class="bbcode-i">quick $500</span> from scamming noobs.</p>
<p>Kaitnieks is not developing AutoRune.  RaW has asked him multiple times, and Kaitnieks has refused.  Kaitnieks has told me he <span class="bbcode-u">has</span> seen AR for RSC and it works.  He has tested it himself.  He has <span class="bbcode-u">not</span> seen anything for RS2, so be very aware of that.</p>
<p>Yes Kaitnieks got a lot from adsense on his website, but that was not the reason he has a website, nor was it because of Aryan.  He simply wanted a home for SCAR.  If he was in it for the money, he would reopen his forums, and let other admins run it, a bit like Sythe does at <a href="http://Sythe.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Sythe.org</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, please direct me to the previous post of yours that states you have a job.  Regardless, the remark was directed to point out your lack of experience in these matters.  If it ends up affecting you, then would be your problem, now wouldn’t it?  And if RaW is indeed scamming, then Kait clearly knows about it.  All the Admins and Mods know it, and Kait, in full knowledge, fails to provide any evidence otherwise.  In fact, he actually states that he can<span class="bbcode-b">not</span> verify the authenticity of this new AR2.  He knows he is a middleman, because, in anticipation, he attempts to indemnify himself against the consequences of RaW’s forthcoming scam.</p>

<p>[quote=“maru, post:55, topic:127319”]lulwut?<br>
I can even begin to talk about the mouthful of bullshit.<br>
If Kaitnieks looked at it, and saw it is ok, I would take his word for it. Why? Because there’s no reason not to take his word for it. I don’t remember Kaitnieks ever giving out false information, and I would trust Kaits over any member on this forum besides a select few.<br>
Kaits motive has already been told. Yet again, you’re too far up your own arse to read what anyone else has to say. Instead, you must be right all the time.<br>
Kaitnieks doesn’t need a motive. As Starblaster said, he is keeping up to his end of a deal. As Freddy1990 has said in numerous chat logs, he is doing it for his end of a deal. End of. No maybe, you will stop posting when you realize you’re talking a load of shit. .[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, which is why <span class="bbcode-i">I</span> am the one saying Kaitniek’s deal is shady, because though he is not directly telling a lie, he is referring members to AutoRune under the guise of a ‘deal.’  And you are contradicting yourself: “Kaits motive has already been told” and “Kaitnieks doesn’t need a motive.”  What is his motive to keep the deal?  If it ends up scamming hundreds to thousands of dollars out of 10 year olds pockets, why doesn’t he call off the deal?</p>
<p>[quote=“maru, post:55, topic:127319”]The deal that Kaitnieks had with Raw. Starblaster has already said that Kaits didn’t tell him what the deal was, but there was one.<br>
Also, don’t do that kthxbi like you think people will think you’re cool. As I said, you think you’re the dog bollucks, when really, you’re just a really funny kid.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, I, for one, actually read the entire thread before jumping in.  I read Starblaster’s post, thank you for your unnecessarily patronizing remark.  Exe26 unnecessarily reposted the fact that Kait had a ‘deal’ with RaW, and therefore I asked him to provide more information, which he obviously didn’t have, rendering that post ‘pointless.’  By the way, you should quote exe26 about the kthxbi statement instead of me, considering I didn’t even say kthxbi.</p>
<p>[quote=“maru, post:55, topic:127319”]I couldn’t have said it better.<br>
That sums up my whole post.[/quote]</p>
<p>I fail to see where I asserted that I was more knowledgeable than Kait and RaW about this situation.  It seems exe26 attempted to pin me as being pretentious, but only succeeded in having a clearly mentally handicapped sped agree with him.</p>

You have to be the most arrogant person I have ever met. You need to start seeing sense.</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t he want to make a quick $500 for 3 lines of text? You think that Kaits is some god. He isn’t. He wants and needs money just like the rest of us, actually. $500 is little money now? That’s about £250 which isn’t exactly a small amount of money. Or are you just a spoilt little twat? I think you must be with the attitude you have. No one knows whether this is a scam or it isn’t. Until I see some firm evidence that this is a scam then I see no reason that Kaits can’t take cash for the link.</p>
<p>All of what you stated was irrelevant. Have a quick peek at the topic title, and then tell me what ‘This is what AdSense pays Mopar’ has anything to with it.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>A quick $500?  I know I wouldn’t steal $500 unless it’s out of some asshole corporation’s pocket.  I don’t think he’s a god.  I don’t think he’s a dick either.  Oh wow, $500 = £250, you sure convinced me.  Oh wait.  Hold on.  No, you didn’t, fucktard.</p>
<p>Seriously grow some balls and get a job before you decide you would step out of your ethics and screw over little kids just to get a bit of cash.  Firm evidence?  RaW is doing this.  What do you have to disprove it?</p>
<p>All of what I said was completely relevant.  You said Kait never had his forums up for money.  I proved you wrong.  You said Adsense pays per 1000 clicks.  Again I proved you wrong.  You said a vast majority of forum users block ads.  I showed how you were mistaken.  And to push the point even further, take a look at <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,36482.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this thread</a>.  This is only firefox users and still less than half were using adblock at the time of their post.  Judging by the disclaimer on Kait’s site, he is clearly skeptical of AR2’s existence.</p>
<p>At any rate, you are the one who seems to think Kait is a god.  Your reasoning is, ‘If Kait looked at it and saw that it’s ok, then it must be ok.’  You’re taking for granted the fact that Kait will be truthful.  I’m the one who is saying this is probably a scam, though I’m trying to figure out Kait’s motive for putting it on the site.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ah this is such fun. Let me just brew a cup of tea so I can, again, prove you are indeed an idiot.</p>
<p>I’ll break it down for you, sentence by sentence.</p>
<blockquote>I know I wouldn't steal $500 unless it's out of some asshole corporation's pocket.</blockquote>
Who said anything about stealing $500? I think it's just you making up things so you dont look like such an idiot.
<blockquote>Oh wow, $500 = £250, you sure convinced me.</blockquote>
I sure convinced you what? Are you so seriously arrogant as to say you wouldn't take £250 for a bot that, as far as you know, exists? No, your not. And if you are, you're only saying that so you can carry on arguing with me.
<blockquote>Oh wait.  Hold on.  No, you didn't, fucktard.</blockquote>
Man you have attitude problems. Judging by your complete immaturity, I can say your about 13-16 and you think your the dogs bollucks round here. Only a few more years before you have to stop acting like a little brat for you.
<blockquote>Seriously grow some balls and get a job before you decide you would step out of your ethics and screw over little kids just to get a bit of cash.</blockquote>
As I stated in my previous post, I have a job. Another 'insult' directed at me. Boy, you sure are shaping up to be the mature one round here. I don't think Kaits in screwing any kids over. Raw is screwing them over. He's just a middleman who isn't taking any part in the whole thing. 
<blockquote>RaW is doing this.  What do you have to disprove it?</blockquote>
Yeh, I did ask for some firm evidence this exists. I never said I had evidence to disprove, but then again the free trials and the pictures surly could for something. Maybe not evidence but something.
<blockquote>All of what I said was completely relevant.  You said Kait never had his forums up for money.  I proved you wrong.</blockquote>
It really wasn't. For a start, you think Kaitnieks has his forums up for money? You obviously weren't around during the Aryan days. Also, don't talk shit to make your dick look big. You never proved me wrong at anything.
<blockquote>You said Adsense pays per 1000 clicks.</blockquote>
Actually, I said AdSense also pays per 1000(0) page impressions. Not clicks. Learn to read a whole post or at least understand what is being said before bitching about it.
<blockquote>You said a vast majority of forum users block ads.  I showed how you were mistaken.</blockquote>
Yup. I did say that. You never showed me you were mistaken. You told me you got 21 clicks on day. Lucky you! A whole 21 people clicked an add that generated $0.20 for you? You're a big boy now. Go spend it on some sweets.
<blockquote>And to push the point even further, take a look at this thread.</blockquote>
I never normally say this but 'LOL'. That isn't evidence. The survey was so small, it couldn't even be considered RELEVANT TO THIS TOPIC. 
Relevancy - The degree to which a document or Web page provides the information the user is looking for, in terms of user needs.
Wake up call. No one gives a shit how much you, or mopar make per day, which happens to be a whole $4 for you!! Well done!
<blockquote>Judging by the disclaimer on Kait's site, he is clearly skeptical of AR2's existence.</blockquote>
He would be wrong not to be skeptical. 
<blockquote>At any rate, you are the one who seems to think Kait is a god.  Your reasoning is, 'If Kait looked at it and saw that it's ok, then it must be ok.'  You're taking for granted the fact that Kait will be truthful.  I'm the one who is saying this is probably a scam, though I'm trying to figure out Kait's motive for putting it on the site.</blockquote>
lulwut? 
I can even begin to talk about the mouthful of bullshit.
If Kaitnieks looked at it, and saw it is ok, I would take his word for it. Why? Because there's no reason not to take his word for it. I don't remember Kaitnieks ever giving out false information, and I would trust Kaits over any member on this forum besides a select few. 
Kaits motive has already been told. Yet again, you're too far up your own arse to read what anyone else has to say. Instead, you must be right all the time. 
Kaitnieks doesn't need a motive. As Starblaster said, he is keeping up to his end of a deal. As Freddy1990 has said in numerous chat logs, he is doing it for his end of a deal. End of. No maybe, you will stop posting when you realize you're talking a load of shit.

Simple solution:<br>
Kait has to hold his side of the deal, so he put it on his site.<br>
kthxbi<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>What deal.</p>
<p>kthxdi.[/quote]</p>
<p>The deal that Kaitnieks had with Raw. Starblaster has already said that Kaits didn’t tell him what the deal was, but there was one.<br>
Also, don’t do that kthxbi like you think people will think you’re cool. As I said, you think you’re the dog bollucks, when really, you’re just a really funny kid.</p>
