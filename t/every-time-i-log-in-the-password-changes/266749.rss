    <title>Every time i log in the password changes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/every-time-i-log-in-the-password-changes/266749</link>
    <description>Ok so when i first log on it creates the player file and that then saves it to mainsave and ips.  When it does that it changes the password to 6375765666305693904  thats the same password for every username.  I tried putting that in the password when i try to log in again and it works.  SO i thought if i change the pw to something else it will work so i changed it to password12 then saved it.  I re opened it again to see if it worked and it did. So i compiled it then i ran the server.  When i logged on it worked. SO then i logged off and tried to log on the password changed again to 6375765666305693904.  How can i fix this my server source is a 508.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 10, 2009, 10:08:41 am[/size][hr]O and everything resets on it too. the stats can be 99 but it will reset to 1[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 10, 2009, 03:31:46 pm[/size][hr]Does any1 know??</description>
