    <title>[PI] Pins - Opening pin for 1 player, and nothing for the other?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-pins-opening-pin-for-1-player-and-nothing-for-the-other/529069</link>
    <description>Project insanity has a weird trade system imo.
So here&#39;s what I was adding:
[code=java]
		if(c.setPin == true &amp;&amp; (c.getBankPin().getFullPin().equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;&quot;))){
			c.getPA().openPin();
			c.notUsingBank = true;
			o.sendMessage(&quot;&lt;col=FF0000&gt;The other player had to enter their pin.&lt;/col&gt;&quot;);
			return;
		}
[/code]
What that is [i]supposed[/i] to do is if player 1 has a pin, player 2 gets a message saying player 1 had to enter their pin, and player 1 would have the pin interface open on his/her screen.

Well, it works. The problem is that player 2 opens the trade interface, instead of nothing.
If I add [u]o.getPA().closeAllWindows();[/u] inside the if statement, it would send the message to player 2, flash the trade screen open and closed then say &quot;Trade Declined&quot;. While on player 1&#39;s screen it would flash the pin screen, then say &quot;Trade Declined&quot;.

This code was added into TradeAndDuel.java in the method openTrade.
[code=java]	public void openTrade() {
		Client o = (Client) PlayerHandler.players[c.tradeWith];
		
		if(o == null) {
			return;
		}
		c.inTrade = true;
		if(c.setPin == true &amp;&amp; (c.getBankPin().getFullPin().equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;&quot;))){
			c.getPA().openPin();
			c.notUsingBank = true;
			o.sendMessage(&quot;&lt;col=FF0000&gt;The other player had to enter their pin.&lt;/col&gt;&quot;);
			return;
		}
		c.canOffer = true;
		c.tradeStatus = 1;
		c.tradeRequested = false;
		c.getItems().resetItems(3322);
		resetTItems(3415);
		resetOTItems(3416);
		String out = Misc.optimizeText(o.playerName);
		if(o.playerRights == 1) {
			out = &quot;@cr1@&quot; + out;
		} 
		else if(o.playerRights == 2) {
			out = &quot;@cr2@&quot; + out;
		}
		/**+o.getItems().freeSlots()+*/
		c.getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;Trading with: &quot; + Misc.optimizeText(o.playerName), 3417);
		c.getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 3431);
		c.getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;Are you sure you want to make this trade?&quot;, 3535);
		c.getPA().sendFrame248(3323, 3321);
	}[/code]
The reason it was added right after [b]c.inTrade = true;[/b] is because I use inTrade as a check in the pin file so it doesn&#39;t open the wrong interface..

Edit:
Got it to do what I wanted, but I&#39;d rather it not say &quot;Trade Declined&quot; (Even though it does say that in runescape) when player 1 or 2 opens their pin window..</description>

<p>You should be able to use your ‘c.setPin’ for that.</p>

<p>Perhaps, but that is to check if the user actually has a pin, not if they are on a specific interface <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>

<p>But if that returns true, the interface opens, right? And presumably when the pin is entered/the interface closes, it gets set back to false.[/quote]<br>
Actually, that variables entire life is to check if a player has a pin. If they do, it’s true, if not, it’s false.<br>
The second part of the if statement I posted (This: (c.getBankPin().getFullPin().equalsIgnoreCase("")) ) checks if the player’s pin has been entered or not. If it has been entered, getFullPin won’t show up blank. If not, well obviously it’s blank.</p>

<p>From what I know, there isn’t a check for open interfaces [like if(currentInterface == X)] in a standard PI server, or mine.<br>
I need some way to check if the player is entering a pin, and if so, the trade decline doesn’t show.</p>

              <p>Project insanity has a weird trade system imo.<br>
So here’s what I was adding:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		if(c.setPin == true &amp;&amp; (c.getBankPin().getFullPin().equalsIgnoreCase(""))){
			c.getPA().openPin();
			c.notUsingBank = true;
			o.sendMessage("&lt;col=FF0000&gt;The other player had to enter their pin.&lt;/col&gt;");
			return;
		}</code></pre>
<p>What that is <span class="bbcode-i">supposed</span> to do is if player 1 has a pin, player 2 gets a message saying player 1 had to enter their pin, and player 1 would have the pin interface open on his/her screen.</p>
<p>Well, it works. The problem is that player 2 opens the trade interface, instead of nothing.<br>
If I add <span class="bbcode-u">o.getPA().closeAllWindows();</span> inside the if statement, it would send the message to player 2, flash the trade screen open and closed then say “Trade Declined”. While on player 1’s screen it would flash the pin screen, then say “Trade Declined”.</p>
<p>This code was added into TradeAndDuel.java in the method openTrade.</p>
<p>[code=java]	public void openTrade() {<br>
Client o = (Client) PlayerHandler.players[c.tradeWith];</p>
<pre><code>	if(o == null) {
		return;
	}
	c.inTrade = true;
	if(c.setPin == true &amp;&amp; (c.getBankPin().getFullPin().equalsIgnoreCase(""))){
		c.getPA().openPin();
		c.notUsingBank = true;
		o.sendMessage("&lt;col=FF0000&gt;The other player had to enter their pin.&lt;/col&gt;");
		return;
	}
	c.canOffer = true;
	c.tradeStatus = 1;
	c.tradeRequested = false;
	c.getItems().resetItems(3322);
	resetTItems(3415);
	resetOTItems(3416);
	String out = Misc.optimizeText(o.playerName);
	if(o.playerRights == 1) {
		out = "@cr1@" + out;
	} 
	else if(o.playerRights == 2) {
		out = "@cr2@" + out;
	}
	/**+o.getItems().freeSlots()+*/
	c.getPA().sendFrame126("Trading with: " + Misc.optimizeText(o.playerName), 3417);
	c.getPA().sendFrame126("", 3431);
	c.getPA().sendFrame126("Are you sure you want to make this trade?", 3535);
	c.getPA().sendFrame248(3323, 3321);
}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>The reason it was added right after <span class="bbcode-b">c.inTrade = true;</span> is because I use inTrade as a check in the pin file so it doesn’t open the wrong interface…</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Got it to do what I wanted, but I’d rather it not say “Trade Declined” (Even though it does say that in runescape) when player 1 or 2 opens their pin window…</p>
