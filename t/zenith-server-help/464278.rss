    <title>Zenith Server Help</title>

    <description>hi, guys. i am new to the latest revisions and wanted to start trying them, and used the Zenith Source.

It isn&#39;t an impossible thing for me, im just encountering problems that i just cant seem to fix.

1st:          I changed the ::home teleport, but i dont know how to change the player spawn when the new player joins. This means that the new player logs on, and they are still at the old home. 

2nd:          I created a new owner to replace king_zenith, but they only get the crown and not the rights / commands. How do i fix this?

3rd:          How do i give donor rights? The owner account is unable to get to the donor zone because it doesnt have the donator rights. How do i give donor rights to staff and to players?

4th:          Where in the files do i go to add static npcs?

PS: i will pay you on my server with staff when it goes up

THANKS, OWNER-X</description>

              <p>go to settings.java for the home telepot… go to commands.java to fix the owner commands so you can give people rights and shit… same thing with donor rights… Permdonator or some shit in commands.java… NpcSpawning.java to add npcs and shit</p>
