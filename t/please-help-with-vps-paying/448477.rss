    <description>my friend brought a windows vps from vpsland.com

we have set up vpn and everything.

BUt on my desktop and his desktop (not vps) it doesnt let us log in.

We have tried replacing it with no-ip on both our desktop + the vps and the original vps ip.

Still doesnt connect.

We get &quot;error connecting to server&quot;.

Please help.</description>
