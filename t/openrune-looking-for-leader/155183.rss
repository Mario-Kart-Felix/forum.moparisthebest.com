    <title>OpenRune - Looking for leader</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/openrune-looking-for-leader/155183</link>
    <description>[size=20pt]OpenRune[/size]
OpenRune.org is now looking for someone to volunteer for a leadership position.
This is a new site I was planning on developing further, but I haven&#39;t the time as a different project has begun to consume my time.
We are looking for someone who is very experienced in Java programming, as well as web design.

[b]OpenRune&#39;s Roadmap and Goals[/b]
OpenRune is meant to be a powerful client/server, developed by a dedicated community.
It will be a mature group of individuals, OpenRune will not accept anyone under 16 onto the development team. (14 and 15 allowed, but must submit an extensive application)
OpenRune will never be closed source, the source code must always be available to anyone who wants it.

[b]OpenRune has a bright future![/b]
OpenRune is essentially the open source development team for a company called &quot;RuneServe Co.&quot; which is currently undergoing the final stages of preparation before launch. (I happen to be working for the company, which is where my time will be devoted to)
RuneServe plans to sell cheap hosting for RuneScape private servers, and OpenRune will be the primary installation for client&#39;s servers if they choose not to provide their own.
So by developing for OpenRune, you could be paid by RuneServe!

As I have said, OpenRune is looking for someone to design a website, build a community, and lead development on a client/server.
You will get FTP access to OpenRune.org, MySQL, PHP, Ruby on Rails, unlimited space/bandwidth, etc., possibility of being paid, and anything else you require.

Thanks,
Bryson West - [i]CEO/CFO RuneServe Co.[/i]

[b]A note to all wondering about our website:[/b] OpenRune.org is currently running on a temporary layout, we will be launching a new one as soon as a new leader can be found. The forums are up temporarily as well.</description>
