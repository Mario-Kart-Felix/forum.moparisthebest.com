    <title>Am I just being paranoid? READ ALL OF IT!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/am-i-just-being-paranoid-read-all-of-it/304294</link>
    <description>Last night I had a dream, it started out showing an FBI van driving fast down a highway, then it pulled in to my driveway. Suddenly, 3 FBI agents opened the side-slide door to the van. I was in my room on the computer working on my RuneScape Private Server and they came jumping in through my window, breaking the glass. I quickly got up and ran out of my room in an attempted escape even though I didn&#39;t know why they were at my house. One FBI agent had this little object in his hand, it was like three black nerf darts taped together but without the rubber cup on the front of it. He threw it right next to me and it tazed me and I was on the ground wiggling around trying to break free of this invisible net on me. The picked me up and were putting handcuffs on me but that&#39;s when I woke up.

Today, I was really worried and I&#39;ve been thinking lately that the FBI&#39;s out to get me. Do you think this dream was a sign to stop with rsps or I&#39;ll get arrested? Or it was just a dream and it won&#39;t happen? I know this sounds insane but that dream has been bugging me a lot lately.</description>

Subject: R0ckstar96</p>
<p>Dear <a href="mailto:Lukehasabox@hotmail.com">Lukehasabox@hotmail.com</a>,</p>
<p>We have received some reports on recent copyright infringements towards JaGeX LTD.<br>
A man that goes by the username “r0ckstar96”, given by our source/the reporter.<br>
“R0ckstar96” was apparently using illegal programming techniques to manipulate and cheat on JaGeX LTD’s game “Runescape”.<br>
Making users think that they were really playing the real game when they wern’t and therefore fooling them into using their account<br>
information on this fake.<br>
Our source has told us that “r0ckstar96” does login at a website named <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/</a> (Which has had legal trouble in the past)<br>
Since this is the property of JaGeX LTD this is absolutely ILLEGAL and it is a federal offence.</p>
<p>If you have seen, heard, or know any helpful information to help us bring this felon to justice, please email us back at the same email address we have emailed you from.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
<a href="http://Fbi.gov" rel="nofollow noopener">Fbi.gov</a>[/quote]<br>
I’M BEING SERIOUS, THIS IS <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> SARCASM.<br>
IF YOU WANT ME TO TAKE A PICTURE I WILL.</p>
<p>I think Jme really did report you…</p>

              <p>Wow, you can actually remember your dreams? Soon as i wake up, i remember, no more then 5 seconds later, i forget all about it:P, its just a dream. I doubt they’ll actually come, and sometimes same thing happens to me (Accept, its not 1 day later its like a few days later) Very rare tho. I wonder how people can see the future… Lol, codfx, i bet his server is 10x better then yours. So i wouldn’t be talking.</p>

              <p>I see you can remember dreams a lot. Therefore I come up with a Theory; This happened to you didn’t it? The FBI agents smashed through your window and you run away, got arrested and the FBI told you that you shouldn’t fuck with runescape private server because all the FBI agents are busy cracking down on rsps.</p>
