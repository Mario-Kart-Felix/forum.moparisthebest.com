    <title>[HELP] [PI] Making an Item non-pk-able</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-pi-making-an-item-non-pk-able/550336</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently coding a server for a friend and I&#39;m wondering how to make it so you can&#39;t pk with a certain item because it&#39;s a 1 hitter.

Any help is greatly appreciated!</description>

Easiest way:</p>
<p>in the attackPlayer method (there will probably be 2 of these, one in the packets, and one in CombatAssistant)</p>
<p>You would want to add something like:</p>
<p><code>if(c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon] == (YOUR_ITEM_ID - 1)) {
     c.sendMessage("You can't wear this in PVP");
     return;
}</code></p>
<p>Note: This does not check if the player is in PVP or something like the Duel Arena. This would prevent the player from attacking another player while wearing the item totally.</p>
<p>You obviously need to change “YOUR_ITEM_ID” to a number.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks! I’ll let you know if this works!</p>
<p>Edit: It sends the message but it still allows you to attack people. =<br>
Edit 2: I made it so it teleports people back to home but I don’t know how to make it ignore the wilderness level.[/quote]<br>
I would add a else if statement but tbh i don’t think thats a good idea, i could be high level wilderness fighting or bossing in high wilderness and just equip the weapon/armour for a easy teleport out.</p>
