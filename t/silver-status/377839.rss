    <description>Alright, i dont know if this has been thought of or what sorry if im posting in the wrong area too.

I think that the server status should also have a silver status which is within the server status page with the regular servers just the background of the server should have a brighter or more eye catchy background and hover color. I think it should still cost but everyone can pay for one for just like 5$. I think this is a very good idea if you ask me, thats why i am submitting it. Lol.

Thanks :D</description>

              <p>I kinda agree with this idea.</p>
<p>Because I guess it would show that people actually care about their servers enough to advertise, obviously only for those who canâ€™t afford sponsored, so this could be the next best thing for them.</p>
<p>It would make their servers stand out more, which could attract new players to their server. This could give new servers a chance to gain some players while they try and save up for 1 of the top 10 sponsored positions.</p>
<p>This is just my honest opinion.</p>
