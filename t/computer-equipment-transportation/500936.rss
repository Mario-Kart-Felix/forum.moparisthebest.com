    <description>What would be the best way to transport a lot of computer equipment for a video editing and development company? We&#39;re talking about equipment for 217 employees. The distance is from Philadelphia, PA and Cleveland, OH to Baltimore, MD. To be exact, there are  120 employees in PA and 97 in OH.

Edit: Also, what would the best VPN router be if you need all 217 employees to have the ability to communicate with another VPN router in another location so they&#39;d basically be on one network. The city in this case, would be Chicago, IL.</description>
