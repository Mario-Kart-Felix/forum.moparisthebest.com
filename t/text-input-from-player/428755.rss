    <title>Text Input From Player</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/text-input-from-player/428755</link>
    <description>Hey guys, 
I&#39;ve been trying to work this out for a while. I am trying to make a command in which a player can use a command and open an interface (such as the add friend interface) and type something into it and store it within a variable. For example, I type in command ::question and an interface in which text can be input appears. And the user can type a string into that and allow it to be stored in a variable. 

I know it is possible because the same process is used for adding friends; the button is clicked, the friends name is typed in, and the string stored in the name variable is added to the players list.

This is exactly what I want to do but I am having trouble executing that interface and also I need guidance as to how to use the input data for other purposes.

I have been examining the packets for adding friends, sending messages to friends, etc; both client and server side. And I still need a push in the right direction.

All help is appreciated.

Thank you.</description>

              <p>What Im having trouble with is the conversion and the opening of the interface. It’s not as simple as opening an interface trust me. That’s problem one. Problem two Im having trouble keeping track of the data flow as it converts from integers to strings. The messages are in bits and I don’t understand the process of converting them to strings. Even though I’ve examined the code. Trust me when I say opening the interface isnt just a simple matter of opening any other interface.</p>

<p>Did you really just ask me that? I don’t see how you’re having trouble with this if you know what to do.</p>
