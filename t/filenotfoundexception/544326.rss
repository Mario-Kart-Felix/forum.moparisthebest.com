    <description>Dear community,

I just downloaded the source Asteria V2. I do have a problem running it tough. Im getting the following error:
[img]http://i767.photobucket.com/albums/xx317/darklegend9944/RS_error.png[/img]

Stating that the following file couldn&#39;t be found: .\data\file_coder.txt
I checked if it was in the data folder, which it is. Does anybody knows what could be wrong here?
(Does this have to do with setting up Environmental Variables? Because I couldn&#39;t find a classpath anywhere in mine...Heres a SS:
[img]http://i767.photobucket.com/albums/xx317/darklegend9944/RS_environment_variables.png[/img]
If it is in this. How would I go by fixing it, since all tutorials simply imply to adjust the excisting classpath which I don&#39;t have. Would I simply create my own?

As I stated before, I&#39;m new in RSPS Development and I only expect trouble setting it up and not with coding it.

Looking forward to a reply.

Thanks in advance,

              <p>[quote=“Bl3nd, post:2, topic:544326”]Well looking at that picture there is no ‘data’ folder. The folder should appear only when clicking java project “RSPS” you should not have to open any other folders to see it.</p>
<p>Since you say you do have that folder, just drag it to where “RSPS” is then it’ll show up in the same area as ‘Source Packages’ and ‘Libraries’.[/quote]</p>
<p>Hey man, I meant in the downloaded source I do see a folder named data and I assumed since I improted the source in my project, it would be able to read it.<br>
Though I don’t understand what u mean by dragging it to where “RSPS” is…<br>
<img src="http://i767.photobucket.com/albums/xx317/darklegend9944/packages.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
U mean drag it into “Source packages”? And create a packet called data?</p>
<p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

// EDIT:<br>
///////////////////////////////////////////////</p>
<p>I added the following to my existing Path variable (system variable):<br>
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_07\bin;</p>
<p>And I created a variable named classpath (system variable) with the following info:<br>
CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_07\bin;%CLASSPATH%;</p>
<p>But I keep getting the error:<br>
java.io.FileNotFoundException: .\data\file_coder.txt (The system cannot find the specified file)</p>
<p>Hope anyone can help me out.</p>
<p>/////////////////////////////////////////////////<br>
// EDIT 2:<br>
/////////////////////////////////////////////////</p>
<p>Problem solved!!! I was being dumb. I had 2 folders named RSPS while only one was the Netbeans Project while the other was a totally different folder. So the RSPS Netbeans folder wasn’t containing the data while the other one was… I feel so stupid right now.</p>
<p>Thanks anyways!</p>
