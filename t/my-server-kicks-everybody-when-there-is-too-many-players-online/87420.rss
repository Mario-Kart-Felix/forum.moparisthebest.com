    <description>My server kicks everybody when there are too many players online and they can&#39;t log back in until I exit out of runserver.bat and restart it, is there any way I can stop my server from doing this.  It just kicks everybody and on the runserver.bat it says &lt;insert player name here&gt; can&#39;t log in because there is too many players online.</description>

<p>Well I tried searching that in my server and maxplayers was everywhere in the codeing so I’m not sure…I think it has something to do with the playerhandler then there’s some of the code that makes it do this in client.  I’m just not sure what to do to make it stop this, or maybe to make it handle more players.</p>

              <p>My server kicks everybody when there are too many players online and they can’t log back in until I exit out of runserver.bat and restart it, is there any way I can stop my server from doing this.  It just kicks everybody and on the runserver.bat it says  can’t log in because there is too many players online.</p>
