    <title>Smiley Dog -- Conclusion</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/smiley-dog-conclusion/308258</link>
    <description>Just to put our minds to rest  :rolleyes:.

First off, here is where a link to the image can be found:
http://www.aetherparanormal.com/smile.dog.jpg

That is the Original 100% Smile Dog, none of these other ones are.

I warn you not to download that image, after much research i have found that this picture has ruined many lives and people really HAVE committed suicide. 

Now as for the border; the original picture is the part with the dog. 

As for the hand, i have reasoned that this too is FAKE.

Unfortunately all i understand about this dog is that it is just a head, no body.

Why is this picture so scary? If you look at the middle, you will notice 3 ghost like figures that appear to be holding hands, and above the hand another similar thing. Another reason is that this is not the original copy of the picture, the original was crumpled up or messed up and that means 100% photoshoped or 100% paranormal. 

Pssh, if you think that&#39;s scary, have you heard of the grifter?

&quot;it was posted back in 2007-8 under some foreign link, the OP basically posted the link stating how fucked up it was. It was real grainy, from what i remember it showed strange images, like a bathtub full of writhing maggots, haunting paintings from old times melting, random forests,flashing colours, text in a different language (from what i remember) all while a strange voice played which sounded like a strange murmrer, if you&#39;ve seen the &#39;there is nothing&#39; video, it was like that voice but more indistinguishable. Then the graininess lifted a little, and there was a video of a small puppy being held up by it&#39;s neck, it was moving like in pain but it&#39;s cries where like a human childs, it then cut to a nursery with lots of craddles all the children where still in the cots, presumed dead, it walked over to one of the cots, and one of the newborns raised up a little, began to cry, and bled from the eyes and mouth. then another shot of a basement (like the original picture) with a malformed hand disapearing into it blood stained. Lastly it showed more text (someone &#39;stated&#39; it said &#39;you&#39;re race is one that is dying&#39;) with an image of a plant rotting very quickly, close ups of corpses. and what i can only describe as &#39;real&#39; cases of exorcism and demonic posession, which clearly have never been seen outside the said country of origin. while this seen plays, the voice that was talking fairly calmly, breaks out into screams of intense pain and suffering, which is just as deeply chilling as the initial shock. The creepy, radio like murmering voice is talking throughout the whole video.&quot;</description>
