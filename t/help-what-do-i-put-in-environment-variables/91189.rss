    <title>Help - What Do I Put In Environment Variables?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-what-do-i-put-in-environment-variables/91189</link>
    <description>Ok, i think ive screwed my Environment Variables &quot;path&quot; thing, somtimes i hear i need two, like a PATH and a classpath, and some people say its classpath. others say pathclass and just classpath 
im really confused.
this is what i have so far:
Path - Change To PATH And Erase Variable Value, and Replace With: (Don&#39;t Know)
Classpath./Pathclass/Classpath - Create A New Variable, Name It (One Of The Three), And Change Variable Value Too: (Don&#39;t Know)
So, If Anyone Could Help Me Out Here, It Would Be Great.
Im Using JDK 6.0 As My Java 
Svenscap3pk As My Server Soarce
And No-ip As My Sever IP - Saradomin.no-ip.biz
Any Help Would Be Much Appriciated.
Thanks To Anyone Who Can Help,
