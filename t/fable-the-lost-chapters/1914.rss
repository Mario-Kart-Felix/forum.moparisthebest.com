    <description>Fable The Lost Chapters
For Xbox
Developer: Lionhead Studios


Fable was one of the most anticipated games of all time. Most RPGs allow you to customize your character in a very basic way, allowing for little replay value. Morrowind stands out as an example of how to make a world where the character has true freedom to play as any type of character they want. Fable was supposed to be one of the greats. In a way, it does turn out to be a great game, but it&#39;s not nearly as open-ended as it could have been.

The story starts off pretty slow, with a traditional RPG plot setup. Bandits kill your father, your rescued and brought to a guild, where your selected for having potential. You are trained in the ways of fighting, archery, and magic, which represent the three basic abilities which all skills are divided into (strength, skill, will). After a quick tutorial, your ready to start questing. The quests are varied, and there are many different subquests and storylines to advance. You can rise to marry the mayor of bowerstone, collect &quot;Magic&quot; mushrooms in the forest, recover the treasure sealed behind the mysterious demon doors, or... not. Chances are, you&#39;ll want to go on these subquests, because they&#39;re one of the best way you can explore the depth of Fables character development system.

In fable you can buy many different types of clothes, change your haircut to anything you want (mohawk,   long, short...), get tatoos, and preform good or evil deeds. Your alignment is a product of how you look and how many good and/or evil deeds you&#39;ve done, but you also have a scariness and attractiveness stat.   Also, you have detailed statistics on everything you&#39;ve done, like in GTA:San Andreas. Every time you get drunk and beat up a barmaid, your levelling up your drinking level. Yay! And yes, you can get drunk (and is reflected by a great onscreen blur and loss of coordination effect) and beat up anyone you want. In one quest there&#39;s a particularly annoying man who has a pass to get into the bandit camp. He challenges you to an annoying puzzle game. Yeah, you could beat him at the puzzle...or you could just kick his ass and steal the pass. The character interactions in Fable are another thing that makes Fable a truly great game.

Interacting with NPCs in Fable is a whole game within itself. You can get married (hypothetically to many women...), flirt with girls, flirt with men (there are gay men in the world of Albion), convince people to follow you then sacrifice them to a dark god, make money buying and selling real estate,  buy busineses and shops, and use dozens of different expressions to interact with people. If you have more renown and are more famous, you will have many more expressions. If you are an evil person, you will find that you are likely to be swearing at people and giving them the finger. Fable has alot of personality, and alot of firepower.

Magic is alot of fun in fable. It&#39;s easy to level up, and can be used while your holding a sword or a bow running and wearing full plate armour. Once you realize this, and get slightly good at archery and dodging, the game becomes pretty easy. But the spells are still amazing. I won&#39;t ruin any of the spell effects, but let&#39;s just say once you have gained enough power, you can walk into any village in the game, break down the door of a house, and rip the innocent souls out of the bodies of the occupants and use them to feed your dark magic power. Sweet! 

As you ascend to the highest levels of power, and start to find the game world is almost completely under your control, the game can get a little stale. Your things to pursue are pretty much collecting legendery weapons, and playing with the weapon modification system, as well as trying to finish the miniquests. The main quest only lasts around 16 hours. There&#39;s definetely alot more gameplay here than that, and once you get started it&#39;s hard to stop. It&#39;s hard not to try to become the ultimate good or evil in the world of Albion, because it&#39;s so rare in a game where we have the power to make any choice of good or evil. However, it&#39;s too bad we don&#39;t have as many choices in the linear quests. 

I give Fable:The Lost Chapters an 8, out of 10.</description>

              <p>I have morrowind and all expansions, I think it is an okay game. I am currently downloading fable. (4 ISO’s!) It is taking me along time because rapidshare links. I hope it is good. I have heard it is really short but otherwise good. I am also playing my WoW P server so I’ll test the differences.</p>
