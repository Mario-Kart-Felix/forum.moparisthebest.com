    <title>Strip down your Windows 7 OS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/strip-down-your-windows-7-os/356966</link>
    <description>First we had nLite for making a tiny Windows XP and then vLite for Windows Vista made by the same programmer. Now, just heard of this program called RT7Lite which will let anyone create a bootable, unattended ISO image with features to strip it down, tweak, customize, tweak, slipstream windows updates and slipstream software. :)

Made by Indians for everyone.

PS For some reason the website is rt7lite but the name of the software program is RTSe7enLite... weird. I like 7Lite.</description>
