    <title>Looking for experienced java coders to help develop a clientside server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-experienced-java-coders-to-help-develop-a-clientside-server/40682</link>
    <description>I am looking for experienced java coders to help me develop, maintain, and manage a new moparscape server, to-be-named Enkrona.
I am not highly experienced with java, to be honest, but I know what I&#39;m doing.
Before you go posting &quot;wel i kno sum coding but not alot but i cn help u lots if u wnt.&quot;, realize that I am looking for EXPERIENCED coders who are SERIOUS about making a devoted and reliable server.  If it goes far enough, we may get into making different ports for different worlds.  Do not post here if you are going to flame, or give me reasons why this is a bad idea.  I want to make a server thats not like any other server, and work together in a team, day-by-day.

Contact me at: Blakeman8192@hotmail.com
Note: If you add me and flame me, spam me, or anything, you will be blocked, and reported to a mod of moparscape, and MAY be punished, if seen necessary by the moderator you are reported to.</description>
