    <title>Haven&#39;t been in the RSPS scene for a while, got a few questions?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/havent-been-in-the-rsps-scene-for-a-while-got-a-few-questions/522493</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t done anything with a RSPS for around three years. 
But I came back now and I&#39;ve been browsing the forums. 
Like in the advertisement section, I saw like two posts for a 317 server and a bunch for 600+ servers. 
Have 317 servers lost their popularity since jagex released RS 07?
And also, I&#39;ve seen a lot of posts of people saying delta is a crap source. But can someone explain why? Because I&#39;ve always used delta and I found it fairly good compared to PI which seems to be famous now.</description>

              <p>Jagex owns the most updated and full functioning 317, so it’s kind of pointless to make anything around that, assuming it doesn’t bring something new to the table.</p>
<p>Anything before EoC will be pretty popular, probably even moreso if it predates the horrendous armour update they did. Most players could stand pre EoC RS though.</p>
<p>Can’t help you on Delta and PI trends, as I haven’t actually ever looked at them.</p>
