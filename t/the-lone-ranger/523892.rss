    <title>The Lone Ranger</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-lone-ranger/523892</link>
    <description>I wasn&#39;t expecting much from this movie, especially after the critics gave it horrible reviews. I thought it was actually a pretty good movie, though. The critics must have seen a different movie because I thought it was good. Johnny Depp was great and so was Armie Hammer (Played Lone Ranger, and yes I looked up his name :P).

I didn&#39;t see any of the old Lone Ranger TV shows or anything, but I went to see it with my Grandpa (because he was a big fan) and he thought it was an amazing movie.

I would like to hear what anyone else who saw this movie thought.</description>
