    <title>[PI] Help with acquiring correct Ints</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-help-with-acquiring-correct-ints/459550</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I would like to know how to obtain correct Ints of any item. I have Toms Suit, and any program I may need. But I still don&#39;t completely understand everything. If someone could explain this to me or find me a guide. I&#39;d really appreciate it.
