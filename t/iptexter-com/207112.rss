    <description>Anyone with an ipod touch should go here.  It has the ipod look and if you are in an area with wireless internet you can text other ipod touch users with your ipod.  It&#39;s pretty amazing and alerts you when you get new messages.  You can also text cell phones but that costs money.</description>
