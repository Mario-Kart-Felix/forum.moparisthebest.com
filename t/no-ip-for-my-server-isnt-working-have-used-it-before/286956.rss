    <title>No-IP for my server isn&#39;t working? Have used it before</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-ip-for-my-server-isnt-working-have-used-it-before/286956</link>
    <description>K This is like my 5th time making a server. I did Like I always do &quot; So I think&quot;. I go to No-ip.com, register a host, something like &quot;testing.no-ip.org&quot;. Wait a minute, run server, try to go online through the No-ip, not working, in the black box that says server is online, doesnt even show me trying to connect. Yes I have portforwarded and this has worked the last 5 times ive tried it...

Suggestions please?</description>
