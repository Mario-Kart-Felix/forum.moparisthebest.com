You aren’t the brightest star, are ya?<br>
I made a single (one line) statement to you. The rest of the message was directed to the OP. NOT you.</p>
<p>The OP said they’re "willing to pay someone"<br>
Well, gee, I think that is talking about payments.</p>

<p>Hello! Welcome to the community! Weather you’re actually new to the forum or not, welcome to the programming family.<br>
There is tons of Snippets and Tutorials on how to create a RSPS, you could try googling some, there’s also a bunch here on MoparScape, make sure you use MoparScapes search bar.<br>
Here’s one;</p>
<p>If you are interested I just opened a position in my team, targeting beginner developers, giving someone a chance to learn alot.<br>

I see you only come to the section when it benefits you.<br>

Take the time to read the <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,331370.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">rules of the fourms</a>. Offering payment for a service (or even trying to “hire a programmer”) is against the rules here.<br>
Creating a development team isn’t, but the discussion of payments should be done off-site.</p>
<p>As for helping for free:<br>
You’re more than welcome to post topics here asking for help on issues, but please post as much information as possible about it in order for us to help efficiently.</p>
