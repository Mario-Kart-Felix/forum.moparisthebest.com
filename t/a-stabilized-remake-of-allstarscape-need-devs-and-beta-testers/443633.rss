    <title>A stabilized remake of allstarscape [NEED DEVS AND BETA TESTERS]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-stabilized-remake-of-allstarscape-need-devs-and-beta-testers/443633</link>
    <description>Well im looking into making allstarscape fairly [i]stable[/i]. There&#39;s alot of dead code inside client.java and the amount of bugs... Not to mention I need help rewriting a good &quot;ip flooder&quot; otherwise known as &quot;anti nuller&quot; The one i have now rejects the ip but makes the server appear &quot;error connecting server&quot; Even though nothing crashed no one can login including me.

[b]You can apply for either Beta Tester or Developer
Use this format for Developer:[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;How old are you?:
What sources have you coded?:
How long have you been programming for?:
On a scale 1-10 how good of a &quot;coder&quot; are you?:
Do you have any GOOD experience of coding allstarscape sources?:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b]Use this format for beta testers:[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;How old are you?:
Were you ever a beta tester before (if so what server)?:
Are you experienced with finding bugs?:
Have you ever played allstarscape (project czar)?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here&#39;s a update list of what i&#39;ve done so far:

Anti-null
removed all dupes (including telegrab and highalch)
removed trade scam (remove all in second trade window)
fixed the beards on server (no mouth/jaw)
removed blood rune lag
re-arranged all prices
re-arranged npc drops
removed bandos, armadly, d boots, godswords from server (full dragon is now best armor)
correcting strength bonuses on items
1 click pickup
removed some dead coding
removed gsmini

Now i know it&#39;s not much.. but bare with me if we all work together we can pull this off.

Updates expected:

A complete anti nuller (that doesn&#39;t make your server offline)
re-writing woodcutting, firemaking, mining, crafting, fletching, slayer
re-writing combat system PvP and PvN
adding a mini-tutorial island (custom)
remove more dead coding to stabilize
Making custom quest
changing login interface
remove emote tab teleports, replace with magic book teleports
adding correct emote tabs (yes, no, dance, headbang, etc)

(I didn&#39;t add more pictures because everyone knows what allstarscape looks like, i didn&#39;t change any of the locations.)

This is only a small list at the moment because these are all the updates i want to get done first, there will be WAY more progress added once we get a development team going.</description>

Have you ever played allstarscape (project czar)? Yes, worked on a few when it was first released a long while back.</p>
<p>I’ve never been a beta tester, but I think this would be enjoyable. I’d apply to be a dev. but I don’t have enough time and I really don’t want to get back into a cluster of poorly programmed nonsense.</p>
