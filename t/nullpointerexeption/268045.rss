    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nullpointerexeption/268045</link>
    <description>alright.. i get these alot and have no idea how to fix.. me and my 2 other friends (they are pro coders) have been working on it.. but since they never had problems with it they cannot seem to find it either. Is there anybody that would know about fixing this?? I am almost to the point of leting someone take a crack at it... if they want... but this started before i even added customs to my client.. is there a problem with that?? or do ALL items need to be coded into the server as well??</description>

<p>Maybe you should focus on organizing your classes, and xx qwertyuiop xx quoted how a nullPointerExeption is created. To destroy something you reverse the building process, so if a nullPointereeseption is created you must reverse the process in witch is what created thus destroying it.</p>
