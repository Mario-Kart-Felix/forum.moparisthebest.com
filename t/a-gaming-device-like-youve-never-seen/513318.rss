&lt;p&gt;The VX2 will be the 2nd notebook born of Asus and Lamborghini&#39;s collaborative attempts. This new product retains the company yellow livery but adds quicker parts along with a widescreen display screen towards the combine, coupled with tweaks to numerous components of the chassis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve come to be so utilized to companies placing sort prior to purpose on vogue merchandise, so it is really great to discover that Asus hasn&#39;t fallen to the basic design and style traps right here. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Design Asus has place loads of thought in the structure and presentation on the VX2. The retail box consists with the laptop alone, a Lamborghini have scenario, Lamborghini wireless mouse and also a Lamborghini chamois for sprucing functions, all inside of one of many most attractive laptop presentation containers we have seen in certain time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The VX2 will come in two flavours -- a black carbon fibre quality edition as well as conventional yellow edition, which we&#39;ve reviewed below. The intense yellow lid experienced as numerous detractors because it did lovers in our place of work -- it is really a retina-searing shade that&#39;ll either gain you admiring glances or make people today feel you might have a significant taste deficiency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The revered Lamborghini badge sits while in the centre of the outer lid -- a perfect placement for displaying off to fellow commuters.

We have seen this type of issue just before in Asus&#39; S6F and W6Fp laptops, but it is all the extra amazing below due to the angular slash of your leather-based panels and trendy yellow stitching. The leather seems to be good following to a set of gunmetal speaker grilles, which run the complete duration on the laptop&#39;s base area. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ËÅΩ&lt;/p&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;v1&quot;&gt;The yellow stitching and angular reduce from the leather-based are remarkably impressive &lt;p&gt;There are other great touches, much too.

The white LEDs flare up, the Automobili Lamborghini brand pops up plus the speakers emit a gratifying &quot;vroom vroom&quot;. If that does not provide you the eye you crave, practically nothing will.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Features The VX2 contains a specification that matches its fantastic style and design.

Asus could have been forgiven for putting in components created for a desktop Computer system as a way to make it more rapidly, but has properly opted for laptop-oriented components that advertise an improved balance of battery existence and speed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Storage room is akin to that of a genuine Lamborghini -- honest to middling. The 160GB hard drive features pretty much enough room to stash two or three hundred DivX films, but which is with out contemplating other applications and files.
