    <description>So I want to start a server again but havent attempted for like 2 years now.

I only have knowledge in delta which im guessing now is sh*t compared to the new bases.

So couple questions

1. What would you suggest Hyperion or Shard?

2. Which of the two above have a better combat system and which is more stable?

3. Any tutorials ( I tried searching but couldnt find any beginner tutorials )

4. Download links to some that are clean, I found a shard one but it has MySQL which I rather not have atm.</description>

<p>Thank you sir, you know any good bases I can work out of and also are there any beginner tuts I tried searching but only found some for specific problems.</p>

              <p>any hyperion or shard is just gna be a setback, instead of looking for a “good” base you could just make your own current server good.<br>
Thers nothing stopping a deta or project insanity from being just as stable as a hyperion server if u know how.</p>
<p>If u really want switch then i would go for hyperion.</p>
