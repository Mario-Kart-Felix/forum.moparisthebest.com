    <description>So I was thinking.... If we can witness stars exploding etc that happened 2k+ years ago NOW, then whose to say you cant go back in time?

Think about it... Another civilization a fuckload away could be looking at us with a super high powered telescope and be seeing the medieval ages, and someone even farther could be seeing the caveman time...

So basically WE CAN go back and witness time by escaping light.

If you think of earth as a projector lens, weve been projecting our history and every movement/natural disaster weve seen across the universe for years. By simply flying away from that lens faster than the speed of light, we could go back in time, or at least see what was happening, because approaching earth again would revert us.


but thats assuming you can go faster than the speed of light in order to get away from it


so ye discuss brb ima hit another one</description>

              <p>[quote=“zyle1992, post:21, topic:419431”]Let’s say that there was a planet in a distant galaxy, and it took 5000 years for the light reflecting off that planet to reach us, and that somehow, we had a telescope that could see what was happening on that planet (or rather, the reflections of light from that planet). Now, let’s say that they were a modern planet (industrious, etc), and let’s say that with this high power telescope we have at our disposal, we see a rape occur (an arbitrary event. It could be a robbery, mugging, whatever you like). Now, you couldn’t very well stop the crime from happening. Why? Because the event happened 5000 years ago. If you tried to send a warning to that planet, it would take 5000 years for it to reach them.</p>
<p>In order (according to my knowledge) for us to really influence an event like that, we would need to send that signal at 5000 times the speed of light. In that sense, you could potentially alter the past. However, although you sent the signal, and they certainly received the signal, that does not mean that they had the technology to interpret that signal.[/quote]</p>
<p>If we on earth ever create a telescope powerful enough to see every single detail on a distant planet, and we have a space ship that is capable of traveling faster than light, we still can’t change the past on that planet. The light that reaches us is a result of events on that planet. If for instance the planet is exactly one light year away, the rape or whatever obviously happened a year ago. If we then decide to travel to that planet, and have a telescope on board that is fixated on the target planet, all we will see is everything fast forwarding, like a videotape. When we reach the planet, we’ve arrived there in the present, 2 years after the crime.</p>
<p>So in one year time, we witness the events of 2 years on that other planet.</p>

              <p>primers time travel is like that, rather than diverging timelines its like a tape, going back in time is like rewinding the tape then recording over the top, its interesting cuz this sometimes leaves remnants from other timelines that they now have no recollection of or even any way of discerning how it happened, because the end points are lost</p>

<p>That paradox has holes, though.</p>
<ol>
<li>Perhaps they can only go back to the time of the creation of the device, for some reason.</li>
<li>Perhaps they have a temporal prime directive, as you stated <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> (Voyager fan?)</li>
<li>Perhaps they have come back in time, and tried to tell us, but we assumed they were mentally ill and locked them up. (Or assumed they were Gods, and worshipped them…)</li>
<li>Perhaps it is difficult to compensate for orbits, expansion of the universe etc., so they went back in time and ended up on some far away rock that wasn’t Earth. Remember that if you were going a long way back, you’d not only have to change time but also shoot yourself some considerable distance through space.</li>
</ol>
<p>OK, so <span class="hashtag">#4</span> was a little sci-fi, but my point is really just that it doesn’t rule anything out just because we haven’t seen them… and also that ending up in the right place and time has surely gotta be SO FREAKIN HARD.

Unless they have a ‘prime directive’ to not interfere in past times.  Someone above said that someone would probably try to do that though, and that’s true, but then the good guys could just go further back in time and stop him, right?  So maybe time travel is possible and people from the future are among us right now!</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/the">@the</a> whole light traveling mirror thing, seeing old light is not going back in time any more than watching a video recording of the past is going back in time.  Same difference.</p>

that makes no sense, if you travelled faster then the speed of light in x direction you’d be chilling miles away from earth thne if you returned people would be older by only by the amount of time you left for like if you travelled at the speed of light for 10 years then 10 years back they’d be 20 years older but so would you[/quote]<br>
WRONG.<br>
So<br>
t = t_0 / (sqrt(1-(v/c)^2))<br>
Where t is the time for them, and t_0 is your perceived time.<br>
That formula (along with its siblings) is also the reason that the neutrinos is a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>So 0.9999999934843c will make you travel one year in time, for every hour you perceive.</p>

<p>The memory will remain however the arrangement of particles that compose our planet have moved out from that phase and are in a different phase. There is no way you can travel back in time because the composition has changed, everything has been changed.</p>

<p>I may be wrong, but I’m not sure we’ll ever have such powerful telescopes. Or maybe not accurately. Just with our eyes, were seeing different color stars but its only because of their distance.</p>

              <p>thats an interesting idea, because technically you would infleunce the past if you coudl travel faster than the speed of light, which is obviously the theory but the question is would you? Because if you think about it what you can see is light of a distant past, whats currently happening on that planet isnt the event you can see, its an event 5000 years after waht you can see so if you sent  message at 5000times the speed of light it’d arrive there exactly 5000 years after the event. If you tried warning the planning at the speed of light it would be 10,000 years after the event occured (5000 for the light to reach you and then 5000 for the warning to go back)</p>

Now, let’s say that they were a modern planet (industrious, etc), and let’s say that with this high power telescope we have at our disposal, we see a rape occur (an arbitrary event. It could be a robbery, mugging, whatever you like). Now, you couldn’t very well stop the crime from happening. Why? Because the event happened 5000 years ago.
