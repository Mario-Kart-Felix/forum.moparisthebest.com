    <title>Stat reset?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stat-reset/271691</link>
    <description>Hello, i&#39;ve basically added a npc which when you talk to him he says what stat do you want to reset, and then its got ur choice which says attack or defence..

Here&#39;s my code for that bit


[code]			case 116:
				talk(&quot;What stats would you like to reset? It Will cost 2Bil cash to reset One&quot;, 606);
                                break;
              		case 117:
				choice(&quot;Attack.&quot;, &quot;Defence.&quot;);
				break;
[/code]

How do i make it so that if you click attack, it deletes ur attk exp to 0 and attk lv to 1, and if you click def it resets ur def xp to 0 and lv to 1.
Also i want to make it so that, when you click one it takes your 2 bil cash if so you&#39;ve got it.

Help will be appreciated thanks</description>
