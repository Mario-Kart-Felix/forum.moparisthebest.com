<p>They were able to prove it all the way back when Einstein first developed General Relativity. Nowadays, there are many other proofs, most commonly the red-light experiment. The user Rodgerwilco has no scientific knowledge and still blatantly comments on this topic, which in a sense, is a hazard to truth itself for people who have little knowledge of this subject will be attaining false information.</p>

        <p>Congruent, before I want to go any further I want to say something, and while I don’t want to sound mean it has to be said, pull the stick out of your ass and show some humility. Mocking someone for their supposedly poor language skills and dismissing their arguments because of it is completely contrary to this board’s ideals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time traveling into the past may lead to an array of problems. We all understand that history makes the present and future. The butterfly effect dictates the cause and effect that the simplest change in the past can engender an entire new future. Therefore, if traveling in the past is possible, the ripple in time and space would be stupendously unstable.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The butterfly effect relies on the universe being totally deterministic, but that’s an entirely different topic. There are several hypothesis that avoid the butterfly effect hypothesis, a notable example would be the erased time line hypothesis, an example would be the Terminator films. You go back in time, kill your grandfather, and the time line you came from ceases to exist, and you only exist within the new time line where you have killed your grandfather. There’s also the time line protected hypothesis, essentially states that no matter how you try to kill your grandfather you will be doomed to failure, perhaps by a seemingly improbable event. Outside of our universe there’s the multiverse theory, if you travel back in time to kill your grandfather, it turns out it was a grandfather from a different universe. There’s also the temporal merging hypothesis, if you go back to kill your grandfather your time line merges with the nearest time line as to not create a paradox, you kill your grandfather and your heritage changes, or you simply fade from existence when you return, etc.</p>
<p>So the question would be as you ask, it depends on if you want to travel back through OUR universe. But the butterfly effect doesn’t necessarily support the outcome of a destroyed universe (I’ll explain more on this later). When Bowser jr asks you to explain why you think backwards time travel will result in the universe being destroyed, you mock him and ask how he can ask that question and state that no one can know that travelling back in time will result in the destruction of the universe, so, I ask you, why did you state that to be the case? Unless when you say, “the ripple in time and space would be stupendously unstable.”, you don’t mean the universe would be destroyed, in which case I’d ask that you clarify your post.</p>

<p>The term “God” is badly defined, it can mean a hundred different things to a hundred different people. Since you brought God up first Congruent I’d ask that you define what you mean when you mention “God”, Bowser assumed you meant the biblical God of the bible which isn’t a stretch of the imagination at all, to some people the biblical god is the same God that exists outside of space-time and is the sole creator of the universe which is no different than the God you’re trying to describe (presumably).</p>

I don’t see any way I can destroy the universe with or without time travel. This is not an elementary question, you would have to destroy time and space itself to destroy the universe.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I apologize if I came off as being discriminatory and condescending (had a long day in the library). Ok… Supposed that you had a time machine or any other method of travel. This would mean that you are capable of manipulating time and space. Now, you travel back into time and kill yourself (the simplest paradox I can think of at the moment). By creating paradoxes, you are essentially stabbing the universe and creating open wounds. As a human being, you know that an open wound could lead to an infection, blood loss (anemia), and possibly death.[/quote]</p>
<p>As for paradoxes resulting in the death of the universe, this relies on the universe being totally deterministic. Read <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506027" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> paper, there’s lots of math but it isn’t necessary to do. - <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506027" rel="nofollow noopener">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506027</a></p>
<p>If you don’t want to read it, the gist of it is that you’ll be able to go back in time, and you’ll have the choice of killing your grandfather, but the outcome must support what has already happened.</p>

<p>In addition, if you can prove that the law of conservation of mass and energy apply to time travelers, then you can verify your theory. But I highly doubt you can, so stop making me doubt humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The law of conservation of mass and energy applies to time travellers, if you could go back in time to kill your grandfather and if the universe was totally deterministic, it would result in the bootstrap paradox. However, the universe may not be totally deterministic and such paradoxes may not occur. But that results in a discussion about determinism and not about time travel, although it’s almost equally a futile discussion.</p>

<p>We still don’t know if the universe is infinite. We understand our earth orbits our sun and our sun orbits in the milky way galaxy but we don’t know what our galaxy is orbiting… if anything at all. It’s obvious we lack understanding of our universe as we can’t even explain dark matter.</p>
<p>Patiently waits for reply from Niall.</p>
<p>If we can calculate the universe, why haven’t we mapped it out to see where we are actually going? Hell we haven’t even mapped out all of the asteroids in our own solar system… gtfo.</p>

        <p>We don’t need to calculate stuff that are insignificant. The asteroids are insignificant to earth’s orbit. It many areas in physics you can abstract complex objects into something simpler without any significant errors. When finding the orbit of earth around the sun you can treat both as simple points, even if the earth and the sun is quite complex.</p>

Calculating orbits are quite easy. We know with quite good precision where the earth was in the past.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>No. Just no. You have to calculate the loveing universe. Say the big bang theory is ‘correct’ and shit is blowing everywhere. Not only are you calculating the orbit but you need to calculate where the hell the earth was at in the overall universe. If the universe is expanding… we have to figure out by how much. We don’t even know if it’s expanding, collapsing or sitting still. If our galaxy is traveling one way… we still need to calculate all the objects in the galaxy to make the precision of space/time jumping possible.</p>
<p>If you time travel from this spot you will end up dead in space. What if you’re unable to travel to where our galaxy was at 5 days ago? Say it’s off by a million miles… what then?</p>
<p>Edit : God doesn’t exist so get over it to whoever is bringing that shit up.[/quote]</p>
<p>Indeed God does not exist, people see it wrong. All along it were alien beings pretending they are gods, srsly though am i the only one who thinks that is the most logical conclusion?<br>
I’m not saying they made the universe, even though it would still be possible (lol anything is possible if an universe can exist). I bring it up so many times, why do so many ancient civilizations talk about people from heaven?</p>

Congruent: A God is the last thing in the whole universe that should have access to time travel. The God of the Bible is more genocidal than a Dalek. And we can’t reach even close to the speed of light.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>The term “God” refers to the ultimate being of the universe. Whether you are a theist or an atheist, if there exists such a being, only that supreme creator should have such power. Would you rather have a human with time travel capability? Actually, nevermind… you literally just used a Bible example to depict a God, and consequently, basing it on no scientific evidence that a God is evil, only on religous presumptions. I’d be happy to respond to any of your future statement if it’s based on logic and reasoning, and not religion because there is no substance.[/quote]<br>

In my opinion if an universe can exist, anything is possible. Yes, time travel is possible. Stop being so shallow minded bowser, fkn idiot. typical guy who watches stephen hawking</p>

<p>Proof it. You can’t, but people who do believe in God also can’t.<br>
It’s a personal opinion/view on life, i must agree though many christians are very forced and think god created laws. (no offense to anyone here). Who are we to say something can be possible and something can’t, we can’t do that it’s simply retarded because we know NOTHING about our existence.</p>
<p>Why was this topic even made?<br>
Go discuss whether or not aliens are real, since it’s something we can know. Look in the mirror</p>

The universe isn't a sentient being named Steve. It follows certain laws and is highly deterministic (Except when you play with poison, cats and subatomic particles at the same time). Science works, our laws works, there is nothing that show the contrary. If you want to believe that there is one set of laws on earth, and one set of laws in the heavens, feel free to go back to the middle-ages where such sorts of believe belong.

It wouldn’t increase our velocity to faster than light, we would just find a better way to travel through space. Such drives are just theoretical and might not work  even on a bigger scale.</p>

<p>Well no shit Mopeman but that’s in our own solar system. We still have yet to calculate the Universe. I’d also like to expand on Nialls comment where ‘67.80 ± 0.77’ is the rate in which our universe is expanding in relation to the big bang theory. We don’t know which part of the big bang theory we are riding (the part where we speed up, or the part where we slow down). Who knows… in 10 years we can suddenly stall and start going back.</p>
<p>Here’s another scenario… what if we put a time box in space and we travel 10,000 years back in time. We would still need to figure out if we are in the line of fire of asteroids for that 10,000 year span. Lots of variables to consider here.</p>

<p>We still don’t know if the universe is infinite. We understand our earth orbits our sun and our sun orbits in the milky way galaxy but we don’t know what our galaxy is orbiting… if anything at all. It’s obvious we lack understanding of our universe as we can’t even explain dark matter.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Please, just read a science book or two on the subjects that you’re commenting on.</p>
<p>FOR A START, NO ONE SAID THE UNIVERSE IS INFINITE. Where you are getting that idea, I do not know, but so far neither myself or Bowser have said that the universe is infinite.</p>
<p>SECONDLY, we DO know what the galaxy is “orbiting” so to speak, the milky way will eventually collide with the andromeda galaxy in the future. To quote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda–Milky_Way_collision" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Wikipeida</a> on the matter,</p>
<p>“Up to 2012, there was no way to know whether the possible collision was definitely going to happen or not.[9] In 2012, researchers came to the conclusion that the collision is definite after using the Hubble Space Telescope between 2002 and 2010 to track the motion of Andromeda.[1] Such collisions are relatively common. Andromeda, for example, is believed to have collided with at least one other galaxy in the past,[10] and several dwarf galaxies such as SagDEG are currently colliding with the Milky Way and being merged into it.”</p>
<p>It’s not that we “lack understanding” of these things, it’s that our level of technology prevents us from understanding. Orbits are INCREDIBLY simple things, they are defined by natural laws and are EXTREMELY predictable, and as such, the structure of galaxies are defined by natural laws and we can know* if they are colliding with another galaxy, or if they have done before, and we can measure their movements.</p>
<ul>
<li>= We can know if galaxies have collided with other galaxies only if our telescopes are good enough, this is for concrete observational proof, mathematicians have calculated how galaxies can collide for YEARS upon YEARS.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>If we can calculate the universe, why haven’t we mapped it out to see where we are actually going? Hell we haven’t even mapped out all of the asteroids in our own solar system… gtfo.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s not a matter of if we can calculate the universe, it’s a matter of us not having enough observational data to confirm these calculations. You know black holes I assume, mathematicians have calculated that black holes can exist for CENTURIES, but it was only up until we observed black holes that we could say that black holes exist. Because you know, black holes, they’re black in the black background of space, kind of hard to observe. But YEARS before we knew for certain black holes existed, mathematicians calculated their possible effects and some of those calculations have been shown to be absolutely correct. The same is true for dark matter, we can’t observe it directly but we know the effect it’s having and mathematicians have been calculating its effect for years.</p>
<p>And as for mapping our solar system, that is an incredibly ignorant and quite frankly stupid to say, things like asteroids are dark, they emit no light, they are INCREDIBLY hard to observe visually or otherwise, but we know their effects based on the interactions they have with other objects in the solar system. You know Pluto? Before it was actually discovered, we KNEW it was there because both Pluto and Neptune had a very large affect on the orbit of Uranus (again, orbits are INCREDIBLY SIMPLE mathematical equations that were founded by Newton), and to quote the Wikipedia page for Pluto:</p>
<p>“In the 1840s, using Newtonian mechanics, Urbain Le Verrier predicted the position of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analysing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus.[27] Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century caused astronomers to speculate that Uranus’ orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune. In 1906, Percival Lowell, a wealthy Bostonian who had founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona in 1894, started an extensive project in search of a possible ninth planet, which he termed “Planet X”.[28] By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet.[29] Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, on March 19, 1915, surveys had captured two faint images of Pluto, but they were not recognised for what they were.[29][30] There are fifteen other known pre-discoveries, with the oldest made by the Yerkes Observatory on August 20, 1909.[31]”</p>
<p>But all this, discovering planets because of the affect they have, it’s not NEW, it is INCREDIBLY OLD and is well founded in mathematics and natural laws. People knew the earth was round before actually having satellites in the sky because, as an old sailors piece of knowledge, you see the crows nest and top of a ship before you see the bottom. If the ocean was not curved, this would not be so. There were also some REALLY smart minds in history who COULD say that the earth was round because of the affects it has on say, the moon, Aristotle postulated that because the earth’s shadow cast on the moon was round, the earth was also round, a “flat earth” wouldn’t necessarily create a round shadow. All of this, it applies today, we can’t observe dark matter directly but we know that the say, the mass of a galaxy wouldn’t support its structure so it has to have more mass, and when we look at things like that we can apply the mathematics to other things and find out that oh, dark matter is a really good way of observing this. But to say “we don’t know the universe is bla bla bla” displays a real lack of understanding of how the science works.</p>
<p>But you say, “gtfo”, at the end of your argument. Congratulations, you have shown that you are an ignorant person who has no interest in actually learning, and just wants to make arguments from ignorance, and if you want to do that then fine, but you’re in the wrong section if you want to be a closed minded fool.</p>

<p>What ‘stuff’ is insignificant?<br>
In order to understand the universe we float in we need to gather every calculation possible.[/quote]</p>
<p>We really, really do not. We do if we want to be precise. Going back to Pluto, we could observe the effects both Pluto and Neptune have on Uranus but we DID NOT need to directly observe Pluto to say that “an object is having a great affect on the orbit of Uranus”. We can do the mathematics without having direct observational evidence, it’s just having this direct evidence solidifies the science behind it. Go look upon the scientific method, it is not arbitrary, many of the elements I talk about here are well founded, based on observations that are repeatable. We didn’t just say “Uranus has a funny orbit, there must be a planet affecting it”, we knew that a planet must be affecting Uranus because the orbit of Uranus is engrained in mathematics, and those mathematics apply to everything else. The observation of Pluto was an expected result, the “observation” of black holes was an expected result (although many mathematicians were sceptical that such an object could even exist within our universe, the actual mathematical equations for a black hole were 100% solid and well founded).</p>

<p>The universe kind of DOES care about laws, because you know, they’re LAWS.</p>
<p>One could say that if a law is broken, it’s not that the universe is being supernatural it’s that our idea of a law is broken. Scientific theories are not laws because they HAVE to be open to being wrong (if not, at least partially), otherwise they would be called LAWS. It’s like when people say that “evolution is wrong because it’s JUST A THEORY”, well yes, but so is gravity, they are not scientific laws.</p>

The Web Guy: You can’t run away from the energy requirement. Getting Frell to 0.9 C would require 64 kg antimatter. Getting him to the point where 3 days for him is one year for other would require the same energy as 6 ton antimatter. Frell isn’t very heavy (I assumed he was 50 kg), if you want a spaceship to those speeds you are really loveed. And I haven’t even taken into consideration air resistance and escaping gravity.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Why you are using a capital C? It confused me haha.</p>
<p>According to Harold White, a theoretical physicist who is working at NASA, you can achieve this with far less amount of mass.</p>

<p>I don’t have time to read those links right now, but I have heard of the warp drive idea. The problem is, as far as we know, it’s just speculation. For example, a big problem with the warp drive idea is that coming out of warp drive would create so much energy the whole region of space would be affected, your ship would be gone. It’s like, if you suddenly accelerate a baseball at the speed of light, and then stop it, the energy created would be equivalent to several nuclear bombs.</p>
<p>So I may come back and reply to those links, I just had some forehand knowledge and felt the need to reply.</p>

<p>We know the universe IS EXPANDING. Wow. Please, just go read a science book. Einstein all the way back speculated that the universe HAD TO be expanding or “shrinking” so to speak, but he thought the idea was so outrageous at the time that he stuck to a “consistent universe” idea, it wasn’t until Hubble came along and showed that the universe was indeed expanding, that the redshift in galaxies is conclusive proof that the universe is expanding, otherwise there would be blueshift, or there would be no shift in light.</p>
<p>But that figure I mentioned SHOWED HOW MUCH IT IS EXPANDING, the redshift is getting more stretched and that is the rate that it is stretching. Universal expansion is SPEEDING UP, THIS IS DIRECT OBSERVATIONAL PROOF, THERE IS MATHEMATICAL PROOFS THAT SHOW THE SAME THING.</p>
<p>The UNIVERSE IS NOT GOING TO SUDDENLY GO BACK AND START COLLAPSING, it would break ALL of our observational evidence, ALL of our mathematical proofs, AND IT WOULD GO AGAINST PHYSICAL LAWS. The universe starting to shrink would be a big of a thing as “evolution is wrong”, and that “gravity will suddenly STOP WORKING”, and that “humans don’t really give birth to humans, storks deliver them”. If you want to believe that the universe will suddenly start shrinking to satisfy your own ideas, then go ahead, please, I mean that, go ahead, learn science and write a scientific paper. If the universe does start collapsing, and you knew before hand before THOUSANDS of independent scientists over centuries, you will be the biggest thing since jesus. No, you will be bigger, you will be a fucking GOD in the scientific community.</p>
<p>Good fucking grief.</p>

<p>Here’s another scenario… what if we put a time box in space and we travel 10,000 years back in time. We would still need to figure out if we are in the line of fire of asteroids for that 10,000 year span. Lots of variables to consider here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can manipulate time, we can slow it down or speed it up but we can never go back in time.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Explain this. We can manipulate time in the sense that time is relative to each observer. This is not manipulating time in the same sense as time travel.</p>
<p>If you have two identical perfect watches, perfectly synchronised, and you have one on earth and one on a spaceship, if you then send that spaceship to travel the speed of light TECHNICALLY the watch on the spaceship will appear slower, it will be a few “seconds” behind. They did NOT TRAVEL BACK IN TIME, they experienced time slower compared to the people ON EARTH, the people on EARTH’S REFERENCE FRAME.</p>
<p>AND THE FUNNY THING IS, THIS IS WHY WE CAN SAY THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING. The universe is expanding AT AN INCREASING RATE, it will GO FASTER THAN LIGHT IN SOME PLACES. You can’t go faster than light, but the further away you are you can. This is explained in Einstein’s equations, there is mathematical proof of this AND THERE IS OBSERVATIONAL PROOF THAT THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING.</p>
<p>Galaxies, galaxies the furthest away from us, galaxies on the edge of the observable universe, they will pass the threshold where we won’t be able to see them any more. This is an AMAZING, GROUND BREAKING discovery in the world of science. But if you think differently, you’re quite welcome to.</p>

When getting back the the earth the two clock will not be synchronised. This is due to non-constant frame of reference. I might be wrong here, so read about the twin paradox yourself.

This is why I want him to explain how he thinks time travel works. If it is a portal/wormhole/pond , wouldn’t you risk some serious consequences when the gravity “goes trough” the portal?

        <p>I scrolled this page and the first thing I saw was where you claim the universe is expanding. Reading a science book won’t do shit. How come we haven’t mapped out all the asteroids in our solar system that posses a threat to Earth? Or maybe we should observe something closer like how we are unable to predict our own future with global warming, cure cancer or help out our neighbors but yet you sit here and claim all this knowledge about THIS GIGANTIC ASS UNIVERSE? Don’t be so stubborn.</p>
<p>We do know objects in the universe are moving away from us but we don’t know if the universe is truly expanding. For all we know we could all be in orbit. I understand how science works but don’t be so ignorant. Science requires an open mind, which you lack. I am sure you’re a guy who reads instructions, worships the bible and believes all he reads from a text book.</p>
<p>Maybe you can read a book or a netflix show and learn how light travels. You will learn that it takes light thousands of years to reach us from another universe. What we see today is thousands of years behind. We truly have no fucking idea what is going on in terms of orbit, expansion, contraction. Only time will tell.</p>
<p>In response to your black hole equation bs… we all know you divide by 0. Have a good day sir.</p>

        <p>Rodgerwilco: Did the universe molest you as a kid? You seem a bit angry at it.</p>
<p>If you had read in a science book, you would know that the universe is expanding from every point of view in the universe. Both I and Niall are open minded, but we see the need to follow certain rules in science. Like nothing happens without a reason and conservation of energy (And the other conservation laws, as these make it easy to see if you did something terrible wrong)</p>
<p>I might show you some of the physics/maths behind stuff like orbits later, if Niall doesn’t beat me to it.</p>
