&quot;There was a young lady of Wight
Who traveled much faster than light
She departed one day,
In a relative way,
And arrived on the previous night&quot; 

                                                                                                                      Stephen Hawking   


 &quot; Time travel to the future or going back to the past. These ideas have been repeatedly used by authors of science fiction, but is time travel really limited to fantasy? By studying the laws of physics, we will see if it really is possible to travel in the fourth dimension we call time. 

                 You are now reading the introduction to this blog, you have probably already read the welcoming quote by hawking and you will maybe read the rest of the articles on this site (at least I hope you do so). This morning, you woke up in a bed (probably yours) and unless you&#39;re planning on going camping, you will tomorrow too. You are therefore certain of two things, that your past is unchangeable and that you are living at the present moment, only the future is blurry. Of course, it is easy to predict what will happen in a near future but it is impossible to prove that your prediction is true. Human beings see time as a strait line with no extremities on which the present advances like a dot on the line. This dot always goes in the same direction at the same speed and never stops. 

                 In everyday life, it is impossible to go back in time, even if you read this paragraph a second time or if you lied down in the same bed you woke up, the fact you repeat your past doesn&#39;t change the fact you already did it before. We are therefore prisoners of this fourth dimension. We may get the impression that time flows slower or faster than usual depending on what we&#39;re doing (like when we sleep for example), but it&#39;s only an impression and a second will always stay a second. Unlike the spacial dimensions in which we navigate freely, time stays uncontrollable and impossible to explore. 
                But the thirst of men for the exploration of unknown worlds is sometimes so strong that they managed to do what they used to define as impossible. During the XVIIth century, the steam machine appears and increases the freedom of movement in spacial dimensions; in 1969, Neil Armstrong sets foot upon the Moon&#39;s surface. Will it be one day possible to travel as freely as we do in space than in time? And if it&#39;s the case, by which means? Until then, treasure your best memories, live a good present and I wish you a long and comfortable future.&quot;

 Now, In my opinion I think it will never be possible to stop the time and space continuum, and reverse it. But I want to see how other moparians feel about this subject.</description>

Of course is would be silly to ban it, but we would never have two equal sides where the scientific consensus is overwhelming. This idea that we have to hear both sides of the debate is silly and is threatening to destroy the science education in many places. There is no other side in this matter, it is mostly the side of those who have opened a science book, and those who haven’t.

Yes, when an idea have enough evidence backing it up we should accept it, and we do. Nothing is better than new discoveries.

<p>Yes we should be open minded to new ideas, but we should also try our hardest to show that any new idea is wrong. I will recommend a video series about Geocentrism and why it is bollocks.<br>

This is a perfect example on how to tear apart a theory. Providing examples where the theory doesn’t match the observations.</p>
<p>Yes, we don’t know what happens to the objects which is going beyond the event horizon, but what is the safest thing to assume? That it combines with the core and make the hole grow (Consistent with previous knowledge iirc), or that the matter goes into another dimension?</p>
<p>If the black hole have a lower mass gain than what it absorbs (Take into account the emission of X-ray), then you stand stronger in your claim that it is escapable. (I don’t know if such observation exist).</p>

<p>well, gravity does affect light, how do you think astronomers do gravitational-lensing?</p>
<p>“A gravitational lens refers to a distribution of matter (such as a cluster of galaxies) between a distant source (a background galaxy) and an observer, that is capable of bending (lensing) the light from the source, as it travels towards the observer. This effect is known as gravitational lensing and is one of the predictions of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity.”</p>

<p>A gravitational lens is a distribution of matter (such as a cluster of galaxies) between a distant light source and an observer, that is capable of bending the light from the source as the light travels towards the observer. This effect is known as gravitational lensing, and the amount of bending is one of the predictions of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. (Classical physics also predicts the bending of light, but only half that predicted by general relativity.) Orest Khvolson (19...</p>

<p>this is a well known phenomena that is true for everyone, myself as a humble photographer and to incredibly smart people, mathematicians astronomers and scientists who design astronomies to deal with such phenomena</p>
<p>the problem is rodgerwilko is you look at people like me and bowser (and I REALLY cannot speak for bowser) and you assume that we are elitist, that we have closed minds etc because we are “book-learned”, you are completely wrong on this matter regarding myself and you come off as extremely close-minded because of it</p>
<p>but as bowser points out, THE GENERAL THEORIES state that once “something” passes the event-horizon of a black hole, that object cannot “escape” (we REALLY cannot know what happens beyond a black hole, although theories exist as to what happens between passing an event horizon and entering the “singularity”), and I “believe” that true, but then again black holes emit HUGE x-ray frequencies, and it’s not strictly fair to say “nothing passes a black hole” because stuff does pass in a sense, we wouldn’t know if black holes existed but they DO bend light through the process of gravitational lensing, black holes absorb light but then they bend light from objects “behind” them, so we can “observe” black holes in the sense in that they emit a huge gravitational pull and therefore they bend the light that was emitted “behind” them, but black holes themselves are the SIMPLEST mathematical objects that one can define, if you have so much gravity and so little mass, you are a black hole, THAT IS IT, and this ties in with how mathematicians thought black holes were simply a “quirk of physics”, but then we ACTUALLY OBSERVED BLACK HOLES, this was A GAME CHANGER, and this happened in the 1930s I believe</p>
<p>but the point I’m trying to make is that you look at us as “book-learned” and you look at yourself as smug and superior (or at least that’s the image you try and portray), you won’t even entertain the notion that you are wrong in that sense, you can’t even say the reverse is true unless you come from a distorted view of what science actually is</p>

</aside>
<p>the process of a stars life is quite well understood, I shall reply to this when I am sober, but we HAVE OBSERVED STARS COLLAPSING WITH REGULAR ASTRONOMIES on the ground, EVEN WITH YOUR BARE EYES YOU COULD OBSERVE STARS COLLAPSING</p>
<p>it’s not some god damn conspiracy invented by astronomers, ITS’ A REAL THING WHICH CAN BE OBSERVED</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>TO EXPAND ON GRAVITATIONAL LENSING:</p>
<p>to myself as a humble photographer, light is EVERYTHING, without light we would have nothing</p>
<p>photographers use light in ways they don’t even realise, the light from our eyes, it seems like an “original source”, but that isn’t the case, the actual phenomenon of the situation is so much more amazing, the light from the sun (and other stars, moon etc,) pass through the earth’s atmosphere (which can affect the light we view, see: greenhouse gasses), this light then likely passes to what we are looking at, the light of what we are looking at then reflects into our eyes (which, just fyi, are a lens exactly like camera lense), the light from our eyes is then interpreted by our eyes, and hence we see images, cameras are no different, the principle of lenses is incredibly simple and is a mathematical principle, light as it “passes through” an object is “bent”, lenses invert the actual lens etc, the real big discovery is that light doesn’t need to “pass through physical things” such as glass, or liquid (see: our eyes), but light CAN pass through things like galaxies and be affected by things like gravity</p>
<p>but when people say that “nothing can pass the gravitational pull” of a galaxy, they mean it in the sense that, once something passes through the EVENT-HORIZON, WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENS FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW</p>
<p>WE CAN ONLY GUESS</p>
<p>SCIENTISTS DO NOT SAY THINGS AS 100% FACT, SAYING SOMETHING AS “TRUTH” OR AS “100% CORRECT” IS WRONG IN SCIENCE</p>

<p>In theory, we are affected by all gravitational forces, so you cannot escape a black hole or anything. But this is just silly to think about it in this way.</p>
<p>Let say your are closer to the black hole, you’re heavily affected by the gravity, but you’re still able to get away from it since the force from your engines are stronger than the force from the black hole. But this isn’t what people think when the say you can’t escape a black hole.</p>
<p>If you go behind the event horizon (The point of no return), you’re stuck there.</p>
<p>Please come with some arguments for your opinion and not only bash me and Niall for not making up fairly tales about physics.</p>

<p>John Mitchell and French scientist named Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1783 were the first to believe that gravity could affect light. I was elaborating. You two need to stop being so ignorant. When you look at a theory you look at how it was then to understand why people theorized that kinda shit. Then you can compare it to the knowledge of today and determine if it’s outdated. You sit here and you want to talk about theories… get out of your text books, stop believing everything you read and face it with an open mind.</p>
<p>Now again, is there anything specific you would like to touch up on when it comes to ‘black holes’. I am sure you two still are ignorant and believe nothing can escape a black hole.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Rodgerwilco, post:79, topic:511773”]Maybe you can read a book or a netflix show and learn how light travels. You will learn that it takes light thousands of years to reach us from another universe. What we see today is thousands of years behind. We truly have no loveing idea what is going on in terms of orbit, expansion, contraction. Only time will tell.</p>
<p>In response to your black hole equation bs… we all know you divide by 0. Have a good day sir.[/quote]</p>
<p>hahahahhaha</p>
<p>can some mod finally ask this person to leave this section, please? we need MODERATION, not some people who are happy to stand on the sidelines in such discussions</p>
<p>EDIT: as a serious discussion piece: all universes are expanding from each other, universes expanding from us is NOT a localised event</p>

<p>If you had read in a science book, you would know that the universe is expanding from every point of view in the universe. Both I and Niall are open minded, but we see the need to follow certain rules in science. Like nothing happens without a reason and conservation of energy (And the other conservation laws, as these make it easy to see if you did something terrible wrong)</p>
<p>I might show you some of the physics/maths behind stuff like orbits later, if Niall doesn’t beat me to it.</p>
