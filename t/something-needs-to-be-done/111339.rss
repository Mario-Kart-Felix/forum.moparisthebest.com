In canada and usa, many animals and being acted cruel towards, people starve dogs for hunting, we kill animals for leather ect.</p>

              <p>Well you know guys there thinking the same about us too you know?</p>
<p>You can say “Don’t kill the dolphins!!”  Then later on you go to KFC and eat some chicken?<br>
The only difference between them and us is that We are not that cruel to the animals we are eating.But hey don’t take me wrong here, WE do treat are animals like crap here too, Been to a rodeo before? Seen how they treat those horses? Think about it now, If we were the JAPS and watching Americans slaughter a deer, What do you think they would say?</p>
<p>Guys know Korea eats dogs and cats? Yeah they do Want proof? <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=CNtV-BMFRFg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://youtube.com/watch?v=CNtV-BMFRFg</a> Now that’s sad to me But not sad enough for me to cry.</p>
<p>Overall - Don’t be so quick to judge, Animals should not die in a cruel way like Korea treats there dogs/cats.</p>
<p>Here are some vids.<br>

<p>Well from reading the posts I’m not watching the video but it is so wrong. I would rather the human race wiped out over having an animal suffering. We are the most intelligent creatures on the this earth, but we are also the cruelest. We are the only ones that enjoy killing. Animals only do it for survival, those Japanese people could survive another way.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not really.  Other animals kill more brutally then we do. Like I said before, I think it should be done humanely, but to say that humans should not eat other animals is insane. You care more about animals than people? That’s weird.  If we didn’t eat animals, we’d have to kill plants.  Animals kill each other.  Do me a favor and look at your teeth once.  Your canine teeth are for MEAT.  We are meant to eat other animals; it’s part of our species.</p>
<blockquote>There is something fucked up about chickens who are so drugged up they just get fat untill they can't stand and they just sit there all fat and shit untill they get slaughetered so we can eat them. And you know what they use to grow the chicken so fat? Human growth hormone. Kind of makes me think of Soylent Green and shit to be honest. Fucked up shit.
<p>I don’t mind animals dying in gruesome ways, it’s more when they get fed fucked up drugs and shit or eat grainmeal instead of grass or when the population of human beings gets so large we destroy our planet so the richest few of us get to enjoy meat all the time.</p>

<p>I know what you mean.  All those antibiodics they’re pumping into the anmals get passed into people, making diseases more resistant.</p>

<p>I would like to point out that the japanese are not the only person who are doing it, human are doing it worldwide. Anyhow did someone ever heard of this," do not put everyone in the same basket"?</p>

              <p>Thats Bollocks!</p>
<p>If it was a bacterium, or some sort of bug, we’d be quite happy to see them killed, but dolphins are intelligent and have large sorrowful eyes, so that gives you luvvies a problem. :mad:<br>
Its the same story with deer, I’d quite happily go walking through the woods, hosing down Bambi’s mum with a hail of machine-gun fire.</p>
<p>You should watch some nature programs, where we its for real, everything eats each other, the penguin mum leaves its kids in a hole, and goes to hunt for food, but the slope was too steep and storm too cold, she feel, beak-first into the ice.<br>
Had that been in America, she would have found the fish, all organic, and she and Mr. Happy Feet would open a fair trade shop and live happily ever after. :rolleyes:</p>
<p>so you can all go back to believing that hamburgers grow on trees and coca-cola comes from the natural springs in Wyoming. And stand on tip-toes and shriek when you find out how a chicken became a McMeal.</p>
<p>Nature is cruel, the world is cruel, the happy, rosy world we all want will never happen. there is no good or evil here.</p>
<p>you could also say dolphins are cruel, they drive fish into a tight ball, and snap them up mercilessly one-by-one <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I’m not going to let some peice of journalism change my opinon like that, I dont care how sad the voiceover sounds, how well the words are chosen, or how ‘unfairly’ animals are treated.</p>

              <p>After watching the video somene posted a while back showing racoons being skinned and left to die without any skin (truly horrific, they were about to skin a baby bear but it was too much for me and i couldn’t watch) i can’t bring myself to watch this video because i know how bad it will be.</p>
<p>I have no problem with people killing dolphins, i just wish they would do it humanely with a shot to the head/stun then death. It’s not the Japanese fault because they need money but its disgusting they would do that to a living thing.</p>
<p>Once again i would much like to see the human race wiped out if it means putting a stop to this once and for all.</p>

<p>This is truly sad that this is happening, and yet you don’t here much about it, not on the news or anything.<br>
Japaneses fishers, atleast in this case, need to be severely punished.</p>
<p>edit:<br>
I have actually just sent several e-mail to my States and Federal representatives, hoping to bring some awareness to this issue, I don’t think it will help, by I had to try.</p>

Maybe if you guys would stop eating the fucking animals there would be no need to kill them. The World economy: Supply and <span class="bbcode-b">Demand</span>. Maybe if the world stopped eating the animals there would be less of a need to kill them. You guys are all saying that this is so sad that these animals are being killed. Kill a cow or a sheep? Whats their difference to a dolphin? They are all inferior to the human race. They are equal. Kill one, kill them all. Eat one, eat them all.<br>

<p>The point I’m always arguing with my friends is if you eat chicken and other animals, whats their difference to eating a human?

              <p>This pretty much draws the line between torture and killing. I dont mind an animal being killed if we need it for food, but torture is different. If you are going to kill something innocent, at least make it and quick and painless. I believe we should kill cows and stuff for food but torturing animals for something thats only meant to taste good is pointless. I dont have a problem wit the meat industry, but this seems a bit extreme.</p>
