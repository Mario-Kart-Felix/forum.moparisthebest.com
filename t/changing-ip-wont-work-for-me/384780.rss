              <p>I did all that i changed 125.0.0.1 to my ip then gave it out to my friends and they said it wont work for them. Then i tried it on my computer and it said “Error connecting to server.” So both my friends and me can log in, but when i change it back im the only one that can log in.<br>

              <p>Well if you want to give out your client, make a copy of the folder then you’re going to need to change client.java, search for “127.0.0.1” then change that to your no-ip, then, you’re also going to need to compile the client, once that’s done, delete all of the .java files in your client, delete the compile.bat, .rar the client, upload it to <a href="http://uppit.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">uppit.com</a> then give out the link, make sure the server is on, and your no-ip is running on your desktop.</p>
<p>In that case, you are finished.</p>
