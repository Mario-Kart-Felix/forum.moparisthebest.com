    <title>CastleWars Help</title>

    <description>So I am going to take on the challange of creating castlewars myself, unless someone has some codes for it somewhere hehe. And her is what I&#39;m confused with so far.

Players to keep there stuff when they die and get teleported back to the start

Make it so that you can&#39;t un-equip the flag

Getting to the flags

Score

When score = 3, game over, and everyone in castle wars gets teleported out

Winning team (Winners/losers are based on cape) gets a prize ( I know how to do the prize, but how do I determine the winning/losing team )


If anyone could help, that would be great.
