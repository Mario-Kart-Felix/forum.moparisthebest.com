    <title>The Black Hole</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-black-hole/328804</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t, but does anyone remember that thing from RSC, the black hole? You know, with the disk of returning and everything? Idk why this randomly popped into my head so I did some research and found out...

Back before Jagex had a decent banning system in 01, they just sent players to a black area of gelinor where they couldn&#39;t move... just talk and have the items in there inventory at the time of the &quot;ban&quot;

Normal people wanted to see what this was like, so made noob accounts and got banned on purpose. Seeing as this was kind of annoying with random accounts being made, they added something in the dwarven mine. You could buy a disk of returning form an NPC for 10gp, which you could use to teleport into the Black hole to visit the banned, and to leave.

Why was it removed? The banned players convinced people to drop their disk, at which point a friend of theirs would have to come and bring them a disk, then they could leave. Also, they would drop it, and the banned players would try to sell them disks at high prices (the &quot;banned&quot; couldn&#39;t use the disk).

Does anyone have a picture of being in &quot;The Black Hole&quot;?

I just got this 1 from youtube, but i wanted to learn some more about it from like someone who actually is a veteran long enough to have experienced it

<p>jagex never removed the item for historic value. However it is a completely useless item and gets ‘rare’ daily as people quit the game and or get banned.</p>
