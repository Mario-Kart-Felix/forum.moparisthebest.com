    <title>Symantec not going away</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/symantec-not-going-away/46135</link>
    <description>Ok, at the moment when ever i try to do anything on my computer with files &quot;Symantec&quot; tries to install itself.

The reason I think this occurs is because I tried to uninstall it and it did not work so I just ended up deleted it from the &quot;program files&quot; folder...

the program that runs when it starts to install itself is called &quot;msiexec.exe&quot; I don&#39;t think that has anything to do with it because I believe that that is just the program that runs when anything is installed.

I am just wondering if anyone else has had this problem or if somebody can think of a solution.
.....
this &quot;Symantec&quot; thing is really bothering grr.gif me and I would kill to have someone to assist me is fixing the problem!

Thanks a bunch, for reading my post and thank you to whoever attempts to solve the problem!</description>
