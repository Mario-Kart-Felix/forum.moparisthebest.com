    <title>Creating a server from a blank base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-server-from-a-blank-base/379932</link>
    <description>soooo..
here i am again.

i decided to start making my own server from a blank base, because i want to be proud on something i built and not ripped and edited! so.. my problem is now: i download the 317serv, but when i have that, it does not contain any .java files that other servers do. i&#39;m used to deltascape servers where all .java files already exist. such as client.java, clickingMost.java etc. but do i have to create those my own? and where do i start? i mean, what are neccesary files?

i hope someone would want to add me on msn or pm me and help me a bit with starting my own server. i want to do as much on my own, but i have no clue how i would start with this :&#39;)

don&#39;t tell me im not ready for a server. that&#39;s bullshit. i have a lot of experience with OOP, and some experience with Java. i have alreayd looked through and edited servers from the download section. but a base server is just completely different.

don&#39;t think i&#39;m a noob and not help me because of that, i know how annoying it is to see newbs asking about things to seem hella easy to you and might sound stupid, but everyone has to start somewhere! :)


edit:
oh, and help with adding modern emotes and GUI&#39;s and gfx, would help a lot too. i dont have a clue where to start</description>

yes, i can write my own java files. no, i don't know what kind of files are neccesary and what methods exist in RuneScript. just a little explanation might be nice
<p>also, the worst problem is the fact i don’t have a clue how to add wielding stuff and combat. might rip some stuff out of another server. just some help could be useful</p>
