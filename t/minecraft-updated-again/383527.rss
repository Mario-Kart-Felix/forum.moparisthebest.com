    <title>Minecraft updated...... again</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/minecraft-updated-again/383527</link>
    <description>Notch:
&lt;blockquote&gt;* Implemented a new lighting engine with the help of MrMessiahs (can be turned off)
* Changed the options around, added a new “Graphics options” button
* Added beds. If all players in a map sleeps in a bed during night, the game immediately skips until morning
* Added three new half-size blocks
* Added Delay/Repeater redstone dust blocks
* Added whitelisting to the server. To use, enter “whitelist &lt;cmd&gt;” where cmd is “on”, “off”, “add &lt;player&gt;”, “remove &lt;player&gt;”, “list” or “reload”
* New save file format, old maps need to be converted (that might take a while..)
* It’s now possible to have more than five save slots, and to rename saves
* Scrollbars in both the texture pack list, and in the map selection screen
* Replaced the Mojang splash image to reflect the new logo colors
* .. and a bunch of bug fixes and tweaks!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are a few pros and cons for this. 
First of all, the entire reason we are updating is to keep up with the latest launcher, so people that buy the game don&#39;t need to downgrade. This means we need to wait for Bukkit to update to 1.3 - a bit more waiting everyone, sorry. 

Good news is - these updates look great! Beds, repeater and delay blocks, new graphics options etc. 
Bad news is - File format changed.... AHHHHHH. We have two options. We can either start fresh with this new format (and in turn get all of the lapiz lazul generated) or we can convert. I&#39;ll put in a poll.

Also - We will need a 1.3 cracked client, first one to find gets an e-cookie :)</description>

this. lol. but really i took more than 2 weeks with 3 people working on it to get falador like 90% complete. well if it does get reset, ill only build a big place if there will not be a reset unless mandatory. how many of the voters actually actively play? plus i know 3 people not part of the forums but play the server that would vote against a reset. falador itself wasnt as hard as building my 2 monster spawning killing machine(which i get quite a lot of string, arrows, and feathers from). in the event it does reset let me know about the towns b/c ill probably be interested in joining one instead of building my own even though i would have less freedom.</p>

I also want Creepers back, fire and TNT enabled, and a more “roleplay” theme to it (no undergound farms, raids that make sense instead of stacking dirt to scale walls, etc)</p>

              <p>I thought after the first reset we said we would never reset again?  Which is why I set up all the automatic backups and such just in case something bad happened.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/the">@The</a> people who want a reset, what is your reason?  The new block shouldn’t be, it’ll be in new areas and we can edit it into existing ones easily.  If you want a fresh area, we can always just move the spawn point someplace not yet explored.  The new trees will grow on the existing land just fine.  I just don’t see any legitimate reason to reset if ANYONE wants to keep the old map.  Enlighten me?</p>
