    <title>WWIII - Taking sides</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wwiii-taking-sides/397181</link>
    <description>I have a project due for school. I&#39;m supposed to create the scenario for WWIII. The nations fighting, when, where, who sides with who, etc. The war lasts from 2057 to 2067. I&#39;ve come to a few questions though and am seeking insight from you guys. 

1. The year is 2057. Relations between Russia and the United States have been slowly crumbling towards a mock friendliness for about the past 40 years, and tensions are raising. China&#39;s economy has long overtaken the American&#39;s, and with the spread of Communism throughout Asia, Russia may possibly be looking for some new partnerships. The American people have watched through the past 40 years as America has fallen behind China, Russia, Japan, India, Germany and Saudi Arabia economically, and are left wanting more. The American Government is as corrupt as ever. The spark to start WWIII comes when OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, places another full oil embargo on the already hurting United States, along with the countries of Canada, the U.K., France, Australia and Brazil. The United Nations is outraged and starts a petition to declare war on the members of OPEC. Most of the members sign it. Major nations to sign the petition include: the United States, Canada, the U.K, France, Australia, Brazil, India (this is important, they have the 2nd best economy now, and were becoming very friendly with China) and Germany (another rising nation that had been becoming friends with China). The nations of OPEC form an Alliance, which includes: Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Algeria, Venezuela, Ecuador, Qatar, the U.A.E, Indonesia, Kuwait (yes, they turn on the U.S.A. even after the gulf war, which pisses them off), Nigeria, Angola, and Gabon. China sees this as their chance to take over the world, and led by their corrupt dictator, they ask every nation to form an alliance with them called the New World Alliance. The nations who agree are: China, Libya, Vietnam, Laos, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Mexico (they fucking hate the united states now), Cuba, Yemen, North Korea, and French Guiana. At the beginning of the war they side with OPEC, until 2063, when they turn on them and plan their world takeover.

Now that I&#39;ve given some basic storyline, I&#39;ll ask my question. At the beginning of the war, does Russia side with the United Nations or the New World Alliance? Thanks guys.</description>

It was claimed that bin Ladin resorted to the services of the Chechen Mafia after many of his aides, some specializing in nuclear physics, failed in their attempts to acquire nuclear technology and equipment.</blockquote>

The “developed” West have been overthrown by socialist revolutionaries in several “emerging” nations which oppose things such as American corporate interests and economic domination/imperialism (sphere of influence).

<p>Oh god, Peter Kent:<br>
“Prime Minister Harper has made it quite clear for some time now and has regularly stated that an attack on Israel would be considered an attack on Canada,” therefor Canadians would be deployed, and the Americans would most likely, but then the Russians back the Arabs. They supply weapons and such for the Arabs. This would be the start of WWIII.</p>

First of all, the “etc” was for other processes. Fresh drinking water does not only mean absence of large amounts of Sodium Chloride. There are various other chemicals and elements that are added to the water.<br>
Also, the fresh water is needed in large amounts and the quicker it is produced, the more economical. Evaporation is a very slow process and hardly industrial.</p>

              <blockquote>Although long known, distillation has found limited application in water supply because of the fuel costs involved in converting saltwater to vapor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Another method of desalination is by electrodialysis. When salt dissolves in water, it splits up into charged particles called ions. Placed in a container with a negative electrode at one end and a positive electrode at the other, the ions are filtered by the membranes as they are attracted toward the electrodes; they become trapped between semipermeable membranes, leaving outside the membranes a supply of desalinated water that can be tapped. The first large installation using this process began operating in South Africa in 1958, but its electrical demands make it impractical except where such energy is abundant.</blockquote>
<p>And even though I don’t like wikipedia…</p>
<blockquote>Large-scale desalination typically uses extremely large amounts of energy as well as specialized, expensive infrastructure, making it very costly compared to the use of fresh water from rivers or groundwater.[3]</blockquote>
