    <title>My first bit of python</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-first-bit-of-python/535415</link>
    <description>i decided that i needed to at least year some of the basics of python before i started classes to make it easier to understand what they where talking about. i was learning from code academy and reading over  mit&#39;s free courses on there website. A gentle introduction to programming in python. 

Anyways here is what i got after 2 days of just learning basic things i would like to know if i done it correctly and if you have any other way of doing it that makes the code cleaner or better explain away.

Here is what i made.

[code]
# Questions.py Version One
# Date. 11.10.2013 At 4:48 EST

# variables to explain the date and username of my moparscape acouant
date = str(2008)

# what is your name with the variable name
name = raw_input(&#39;what is your name &#39;)

# it prints out the phrase &#39;hello thanks for joining me with the variable name
print &#39;Hello thanks for joining me &#39; + name

# have you heard of moparscape with another variable. using a simple yes or no
moparscape = raw_input(&#39;have you heard about moparscape &#39;)

# it prints out the response to the users input
print moparscape + &#39; oh wow you have never heard of moparscape? its the best rsps community&#39;

# yet another raw_input with a question
creation = raw_input(&#39;how long have you been around moparscape? &#39;)

# print with the date
print &#39;I have been around since &#39; + date

#say goodbye i love you moparscape
print &#39;I hope you stick around moparscape is a great place&#39;[/code]</description>

              <p>you don’t really check for the answers. I also think you should update. print is now a function and not a statement.</p>
<p>but kudos for trying and good luck learning!</p>

Looking good mate, keep up the good work. Glad to see you learning new languages rather than the tired old JavaScript.<br>
[/quote]Python’s older than JavaScript.[/quote]I meant new to OP, not new in general.</p>

Looking good mate, keep up the good work. Glad to see you learning new languages rather than the tired old JavaScript.<br>
[/quote]Python’s older than JavaScript.[/quote]And both languages have much relevance and are very powerful languages.</p>
<p><code># yet another raw_input with a question
creation = raw_input('how long have you been around moparscape? ')
</code><br>
Just to be picky, since you don’t use the answer for this in anything, you don’t have to store it in a variable, you may just call the method.<br>
But just bein’ picky.  Keep it up!</p>

              <p>i went with python because its a good place to start. i did consider C++ and java but i have never understood how to program most of the people i talked to said python was a good place to start and i saw a few posts on google saying start with BASIC and Pascal but i cant do much with them… so this is why i went with python as my first language.</p>
