    <title>What if... Black holes!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-if-black-holes/210235</link>
    <description>What if in the center of every star/planet there is a black hole. This black hole pulls everything towards it and stays intact because of the earth/fire/whatever surrounding it. Maybe black holes are made of matter which could explain why when smaller stars/planets blow up they don&#39;t leave black holes (because the black hole is too small to sustain itself and the matter escapes). But if the star/planet was HUGE then maybe it can&#39;t escape it&#39;s own pull and stays.

This could explain gravity and why things are pushed towards the center of planets or stars.

Finally, my theory to where black holes go! I think that if you go in a black hole you will end up somewhere else. Maybe another dimension. Otherwise, the black hole might be just like a funnel and you end up at the end of it. Matter can&#39;t be destroyed so maybe if a black hole gets too full it will blow up and make smaller black holes with matter around them (NEW PLENETS LULS). And this energy can cause fire. Also the atoms can change as they are seperated, crushed, etc under the uber force!

I r very interested in black holes. Discuss your theories on black holes!</description>

<p>EXACTLY. It doesn’t mention blackholes, now if you’d have read it you’d have realised you’re totally and utterly wrong.</p>
<p>I’m going to lock this because debating with inbred retards is a waste of my time.</p>

A black hole is a strong force of gravity that leads to an unknown destination in time and space it would spread the human body out into approximately 200m of spaghetti and suck you in at varying speeds it does not teleport its like digging a tunnel it goes to one place unless you leave the hole early</p>

<p>This theory has no solid evidence to suggest it to even be possible, all mass has gravity in space a big enough space station with nothing around for lightyears will act like a planet and you will be pulled towards it the only reason such thing doesn’t exist to us is because we are too close to a big source of gravity: the sun and the earth.

              <p>What if in the center of every star/planet there is a black hole. This black hole pulls everything towards it and stays intact because of the earth/fire/whatever surrounding it. Maybe black holes are made of matter which could explain why when smaller stars/planets blow up they don’t leave black holes (because the black hole is too small to sustain itself and the matter escapes). But if the star/planet was HUGE then maybe it can’t escape it’s own pull and stays.</p>
<p>This could explain gravity and why things are pushed towards the center of planets or stars.</p>
<p>Finally, my theory to where black holes go! I think that if you go in a black hole you will end up somewhere else. Maybe another dimension. Otherwise, the black hole might be just like a funnel and you end up at the end of it. Matter can’t be destroyed so maybe if a black hole gets too full it will blow up and make smaller black holes with matter around them (NEW PLENETS LULS). And this energy can cause fire. Also the atoms can change as they are seperated, crushed, etc under the uber force!</p>
<p>I r very interested in black holes. Discuss your theories on black holes!</p>
