    <description>This is the thing that when u click to attack somone the character walks to the target before they start attacking if im using melee,i wanna change so u can do as in real rs and many other sources that u can rush like when u hit with ur d claws some feets away from the target,how do i change that?
and one more thing how do i change that when ur opponent dies in pvp it drops he&#39;s gear that he had equipt and also so u can pick it up,so it won&#39;t drop any random pvp gear.
Hope someone will help me would appreciate it alot.</description>
