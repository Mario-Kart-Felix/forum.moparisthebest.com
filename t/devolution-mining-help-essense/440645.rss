    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/devolution-mining-help-essense/440645</link>
    <description>im using an old devolution source, and i cant seem to get the rune essense mine to work. all the mining codes in client.java are fine. i also experimented with that i can mine one rock in yannille perfectly fine, but if i move it to a diff cord, when i click it it doesn&#39;t mine at all. I think this might be a problem linked to why i cant mine the essense rock.

It has somthing to do with Coords becuase i tried woodcutting in yannile and it didnt work, but it did work with the same tree in seers</description>
