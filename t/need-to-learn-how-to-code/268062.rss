    <title>Need to learn how to code</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-to-learn-how-to-code/268062</link>
    <description>okay, there&#39;s other people who knows how to code...but, I dont know how; I really want to know how to code on my server. The big problem is that most people on my server. Most people on my server wants me to code a shop, pk area, and a Staff zone. But I don&#39;t know how to do that. So people on moparscape, I really need your help, to make my server more better. It would be nice if you could explain how to code on my server so my players will be more efficient with my server. My only concern is knowing that other people knows how to code and they really don&#39;t really explain it to me correctly. So if you could just explain how to code on my server, or can you post a link for me to follow. So that I can follow the directions on the link.
