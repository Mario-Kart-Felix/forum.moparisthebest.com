    <title>IsTextIn</title>

    <description>I haven&#39;t actually tested this yet, but it should work fine, i&#39;ve had trouble with bulk buyer scripts that i&#39;ve made where i need to read the amount of the object that the other player has offered but since it&#39;s alligned to the right you can&#39;t use gettextatex because it needs the exact point that the text starts, and since different numbers are difference sizes, the starting point could be anywhere, so i made a istextin function, if you do test this please post here how it&#39;s worked, i&#39;d really like to know, anyways here it is:
[code]function istextin(var x,y:integer; x1,y1,x2,y2:integer; S:string; Tolerance:Integer): boolean;
begin
x:=x1
y:=y1
 if(istextat2(x1,y1,s,tolerance)=false)then
 begin
  repeat
   x:=x+1
    if(x1=x2)then
    begin
     x:=x1
     y:=y+1
    end;
  until((istextat2(x,y,S, Tolerance)=true) or ((x=x2) and (y=y2)))
  if((x=x2)and(y=y2))then
  result:=false
 end;
 if(istextat2(x,y,s,tolerance)=true)then
  result:=true
end;[/code]

fairly basic, the only thing i&#39;m worried about though is if someone decides to make a big search area for the begining of the text, even if it was only like 50x50 pixels, thats still 2.5k pixels that the script is searching through</description>
