              <p>go to start button and in run type in cmd<br>
in the newly opened command prompt u gotta type ipconfig /all</p>
<p>and look for any ip’s similar to 192.168  or 168.192 something similar to that and just go to your ip as a website<br>
<a href="http://192.168.whatever/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://192.168.whatever/</a><br>
99% of routers have a menu there where u can portfoward</p>
