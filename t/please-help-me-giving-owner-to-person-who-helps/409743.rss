              <p>sometimes the moparscape client doesnt let you log in to PI servers. for some reason idk.<br>
so its best if your mate tries with the client you provide.</p>
<p>search for ‘client’ in the client folder.<br>
once that’s open. click on the last line of code.<br>
ctrl F —&gt; then click ‘search upwards’ -----&gt; search “server”</p>
<p>find the line, server = “”<br>
put your server ip inside these “” make sure its changed to your ip and there are no errors in spelling.</p>
<p>save this. complie the client files.<br>
restart your source.<br>
try login again…</p>
<p>if this doesnt work -<br>
make sure ip DUC is running. go to<br>
<a href="http://canyouseeme.org/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://canyouseeme.org/</a><br>
and enter your port, 43594.<br>
make sure the website says it can see it.</p>
<p>BTW just an after thought…<br>
are you sure your source is running ahhahahaa</p>

              <p>It will always be faster to connect through a computer loop than an ip. Unless you are on a vps, hen you must connect to the vps ip with your own computer of course. Also if you say you have done everything correctly, then there would be no problem right? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> So double check the steps you took, make sure you did everyhing correctly, didn’t miss a step, etc. Good luck</p>

              <p>What about windows firewall, Did you allow the port?</p>
<p>Also, To make sure you did the port forward correctly press the windows key + R, type ‘cmd’, hit enter and type ‘ipconfig’. Find ipv4 in there somewhere and make sure that that is the ip you are port forwarding to.</p>
<p>If all else fails I can try to help over teamviewer, I will be performing these steps also.</p>
