    <title>Bot using Javassist or ASM?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bot-using-javassist-or-asm/96898</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been thinking about it alot, and i decided i don&#39;t want to be like everyone else :) I want to make an updater using Javassist or ASM (Yes, i am aware of all the hard work this will give me, but it will learn me alot so i&#39;m prepared for it.). I am certain this is possible, and both of these are faster than BCEL (saw a comparison somewhere on the net). Now, what should i go with? Javassist or ASM?</description>

              <p>[quote=“Krichevskoy, post:7, topic:96898”]The last time I used Javassist, it wasn’t quite as powerful but it was EASY. I mean really easy - you probably already know about it, but the core technology is a Java-like syntax for bytecode edits. Very nice, but I seem to remember that there were a few things Javassist simply couldn’t do. I <span class="bbcode-i">definitely</span> remember hacking the Loader class for multiple Translator support, though not precisely why that was necessary. It’s been in development since then, so the functionality has probably improved. Also, I now realize that I might not have been using it correctly - it’s the backend of an AOP framework, and since I now know what AOP is I’m sure I could use it more effectively.</p>
<p>The last time I used ASM, I was impressed by the speed, size, and overall cleanliness…I like ASM for the same reason I like assembly. What you write is what you get. The problem was that I couldn’t figure out how to use it for editing existing classes very well. It worked like a charm for generating new classes, though. The downside is that you have to be familiar with bytecode to use it.</p>
<p>BCEL is large, slow, and powerful. It’s a dead project - as far as I know - so problems don’t get fixed (I don’t know of any offhand) and new features don’t get added. It’s more complete than either Javassist or ASM (BCEL has Visitor classes, though no one here uses them). It comes with a decent search class (InstructionFinder), which Javassist didn’t match and ASM doesn’t try to match. It’s a balance between the two in knowledge of bytecode required - you still have to know it, but there’s some abstraction to keep you from the tedium.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous facts, ideas, etc:<br>
Javassist has a built-in mechanism for runtime editing (Translator), so you don’t have to mess with ClassLoader.</p>
<p>ASM is meant for things like generating getter methods (there’s even an example in the source zip), so it might work better for modern passive bots than it did in the age of Aryan.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for the nice comment here. Actually Javassist has Visitor classes now as well. I tried both of the libraries on manipulating a standard “Hello World” application, and i’m not sure what to use yet. I won’t start working with an updater until i learn how to use these libraries efficiently and properly.</p>
<p>Again, thanks for the comment. It was really helpful <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>that’s not how i meant. I mean, if i see a structure that looks awesome, i would most likely want to use a similar foundation for my own bot because it looks sexy and works fine. That’s why i want to write it from scratch and improve it with time.</p>

              <p>well, i like a challenge so that’s why i do it. If i made one in BCEL i wouldn’t be able to resist looking at other bots structures which would mean it would be too much like them, and that’s no fun at all.</p>
<p>I’m not planning to make this some uber bot with scripting engine crap. All i want is to learn, not macro/get famous. It has always been in my interest to understand and modify the rs client, so this comes in handy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
