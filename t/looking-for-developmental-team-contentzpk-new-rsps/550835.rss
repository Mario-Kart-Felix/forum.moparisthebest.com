    <description>I&#39;m looking for dedicated individuals with experience in all of the following:

Coding
Web Design
Graphics Design
Any other experience you may deem necessary to running a successful server


About the server

It is a 667 source.  I have updated quite a bit on my own.  The max combat is 209.  Which means the max level is 150.  Now before you run away the exp for 150 is not 2b.  Its only 578m to get 150 in a skill which with the exp rates I put in place doesn&#39;t take very long.  I have a few dedicated players always looking for more.  We have custom content in every skill except for dung and slayer.  Below is the list of updates I have done so far.  There are some not listed as they weren&#39;t major changes.

[spoiler]12/20/2014
Pre CHRIMBO-Update
 
Added drops to the following Npcs:
 
Corporeal Beast 8133
Juggernaut- npc id 17176 will be hosting a event on sunday 12/21/2014 with this npc
Bork-npc id 7133
KBD- santa added
New weapon introduced with proper bonuses
 
12/24/2014 Hope everyone has a Merry Christmas
 
Added the following npc spawns:
 
Pk3r- npc id 17177 and 171778
Juggernaut- 17176 
 
New home-rimmy 
New teles:
 
;;market(old home)
;;pktown(new npc spawn location)
 
Note: I will be in a future update adding these same npcs to the wild.  They will be taking over.
 
 
1/3/2014
Fishing levels
 
Adding new fishing spots at the ;;fish location 
 
New cage spot at 105
New harpoon spot at 115
New net spot at 130
 
Note: The 115 fish cannot be noted.
 
1/19/2014
 
New potion added into game 
 
Level 85 to clean the snake weed herb
Use it with zammy wine
Level 105 to make it into new Super Sara Potion

You can now transfer the old 1b tickets into 2b tickets for 2 of them by typing ;;claimticket. You can also get this 2b ticket by having max cash in your inventory and clicking on it. You can also claim gp from this ticket by typing ;;claimgp.

New Theiving has been introduced it requres 115 theiving to access this stall the spice stall. After acquiring the key from the stall you simply go to the first floor at ;;castle and use the key on the chest.
Image

Finally an update on Hunter and Runecrafting. The new rune you can make replaces the old runes used to veng and only needing 10 of them to veng. The new hunting npc is called a super chimp located at the original area caught the same way as the old chimps are.
