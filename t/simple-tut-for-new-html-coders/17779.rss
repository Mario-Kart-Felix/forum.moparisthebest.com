    <description>this is the first tut i ever made in my life.....but im still young so its not so long...well...this is mainly the basics....advanced html coders dont really need to look at this but if this was posted before please just tell me with a simple &quot;this was posted before&quot; reply

thanks



for the start of html coding u have the website itself as a blank page


&lt;html&gt;


&lt;head&gt; the head has to do with the title etc.

&lt;title&gt;any title that will be displayed as like title - firefox at the top &lt;/title&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;


&lt;body&gt; the body tag is where almost all of the web content goes all the content the public will be reading and watching and stuff this is where it will be going

&lt;p&gt;any content u wanna show in ur website

example of a table would be &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; is for paragraph you dont really need it but some people use it for being neat you also dont need to add an ending tag to it

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;anything here in a column&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;another column have as many as u want&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;


for a background color u can put this into body so it would be like
example:
&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;color here&quot;&gt;

for a link or for the whole page&#39;s text u can make it look like this

&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;color&quot; text=&quot;text color&quot; link=&quot;blue&quot; vlink=&quot;purple&quot; alink=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;   

well for the link i put the original colors blue and purple link is for the link color of course vlink stands for visited link which is originally purple bgcolor if u didnt know stands for background color and alink is for active link which i think is also blue


now since this is too basic im going to add the link making and adding....

in the body section u can add links to ur website for fun or for important things doesnt matter

a link in the body section would look like this

&lt;a href=&quot;the link address&quot;&gt;then the content u would like to put for it&lt;/a&gt; then the closing tag...walla u have a link!

now ill just be saying how to make writing bold and italic....like i said basic...
so in front of the writing or content u would put &lt;b&gt; in front for bold and &lt;/b&gt; to end it

so if u would be writing a bold paragraph it would look like

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;whatever u want to write&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; now thats the write way do NOT do it this way &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;whatever u want here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt; this would be the WRONG way 

now to make it italic its exactly the same thing as bold except with an i so it would look like....&lt;i&gt; and closing &lt;/i&gt;


now i forgot to add breaking and creating new lines before but im going to add it now

at the end of each line if u would like to break the sentence i mean as &quot;end&quot; ur sentence the tag would be &lt;br&gt;....simple....

so an example would be:

&lt;p&gt;any content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt; yes its that simple....now add as many &lt;br&gt; as u want it will make it so theres more space between ur sentences


well i hope that helped some beginner html coders with the basics

thanks for noticing that people</description>
