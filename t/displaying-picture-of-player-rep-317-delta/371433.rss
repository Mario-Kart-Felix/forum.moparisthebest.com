    <title>Displaying picture of player? [Rep++] [317] [Delta]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/displaying-picture-of-player-rep-317-delta/371433</link>
    <description>i&#39;m using Delta, 317.

well, i&#39;m trying to make a public void playerTalk.
and it&#39;s supposed to be like the public void talk and public void talk2 exept, playerTalk is gonna be for when the player speaks, not when the NPC speaks. I did everything perfect, exept one thing.. in the talk where it displays the NPC head animation, i need it too display the player&#39;s head instead. Here is the code i&#39;m using to display the player&#39;s head (currently not working!)
[code]sendFrame75(player, 4901);[/code]</description>
