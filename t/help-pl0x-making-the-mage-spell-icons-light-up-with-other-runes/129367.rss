    <title>[Help pl0x] Making the mage spell icons light up with other runes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-pl0x-making-the-mage-spell-icons-light-up-with-other-runes/129367</link>
    <description>Okay, so I changed the runes required for the spells on my server. (Nature Runes are used for all spells)
Is it possible to make the spell icons light up with nats in the inventory? And possibly change the picutres below the spells?
This would be greatly appreciated. If anything i&#39;m just going to change the sprites for my client so they are always lit but this way would look alot better.
Thanks for reading,
