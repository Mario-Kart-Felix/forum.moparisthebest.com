    <description>It&#39;s time for mitb to update the staff.

Now that JDB is gone[All aware of what happened] mscp is left to ikilki once again.
I really think mscp needs to have an update with mods, because one isn&#39;t going to cut it.
*Don&#39;t flame on this point, or say delete mscp lool0l0l*

Now, when this whole event was happening, Niall was most likely asleep[For his timezone] and Lothy was most likely Roo sighting, or some other activity[seeing as it was mid day in Australia], and seeing as these are really the only active mods nothing could be done till they got on.

Personally, I think Niall and Lothy should be bumped up a rank, seeing as they are pretty active and we know we can trust them[no matter how much some people don&#39;t like them, I think we can agree on that.]

Also, some more Globals, this might be a harder thing because of what happened with jdb&#39;s poor actions.
Maybe if you feel there aren&#39;t people who can be trusted, create a new user group and select some people to use it, this user group being able to lock topics, etc...or maybe warn etc[but not ban]


Finally, the ban of dragonus18 who appeared wasn&#39;t banned, and accepted a mod account from jdb(I was offered one but I denied)

This happened all because we rushed. JBD’, like thuglife said, became a mod way to quickly. Pwnd, why did he quit though? Imo, thuglife also should become a gm, then we would be set for a while. And we need people to be able to contact admins, to ban accounts, or to restore sections.<br>

Pwnd got de-modded for deleting half of moparscape.[/quote]<br>
i knew that, but pwnd did a good action. imo thats was good. Wiping out moparscape was good. But, i don’t see why he did it, as responsible as he is, is site still up, and dosen’t lead to m3at spin, so i don’t know.</p>

              <p>Well, I’m sure glad that what I hoped would happen did. It’s just a shame I had to sacrifice myself for change to finally happen and I hope that these changes make this community even better, the reason I did what I did is not to ruin the community because there would’ve been much better ways to proceed in doing that, but rather I did it hoping it would stir some change up because the way I saw it the community wasn’t even worth being part of with the amount of shit people got away with, so I did this hoping it would cause you to make more staff members, which it did xD</p>
<p>Thuglife, sorry for being a dick to you but I didn’t plan on letting anyone know why I did this therefore I needed to cause something that would look like a reason for my actions.</p>
<p>Sorry MITB/MSCP for what I did, I do not expect to be unbanned or forgiven but I feel that I owe an apology.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Thank you MITB and MSCP community for all of the great times I will never forget them xD</p>
<p>So long and Take care!!!</p>

<p>I agree aswell on lothy and niall being bumped. As far as i know they do their jobs pretty well considering what other mods do. Also mopar mods are pretty bad. There are no really good mods there except ilikili who i dont really like -.-</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
<p>[quote=“ThugLife, post:6, topic:174414”]Well normally i would sit here pointing out all the things God of ikiliki does wrong, but since all this stuff has happened recently i must say:<br>
At least he is trustworthy.[/quote]<br>
Thanks</p>
<p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:22, topic:174414”]Like frank_ said, a public nomination for moderators would become a popularity contest instead of an ability contest, so that won’t happen.</p>
<p>As to what the fake moderators did, it wasn’t that bad.  Thank God for moderation logs &lt;3  There was one ban made that I deleted, about 400 topics were moved which a carefully crafted MySQL query and a few lines of PHP fixed, and 1200 topics were deleted, all but 265 of which I automatically restored with some php hackery, and Lothy manually restored the rest.  So we actually lost nothing except for a few bad eggs, which is good anytime.</p>
<p>You can all rest assured however that I have everything locked down now, no one can create accounts that are anything but regular, I now store a board_id in the moderation log for every deleted topic, and I will shortly have a script running that makes a full backup of the forum every 2 days and keeps the last 5 in storage.  In short nothing can happen to the forum that a few simple SQL queries will not fix.  I now have everything I need to make a simple undo function that undoes all actions from any staff during any date range I wish. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>As far as staff changes go, a few of those were made while I was at it, starblaster and ron are now ex-staff, taharok is no longer a moparscape mod and we now have sppt as a gmod and evil_ has joined the ranks of the moparscape moderators.</p>
<p>More changes are forthcoming, including a new state-of-the-art highly efficient banning system, and a few other things that will make moderation easier and therefore a better forum.[/quote]That was easy.<br>
He just said “maybe mopar can set me up as a Moparscape Moderator” and he gets it, I should try that.<br>
Evil_, help me with some reports please <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
