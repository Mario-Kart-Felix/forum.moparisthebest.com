    <description>Does anyone have a auto cache webclient that shows progress that is open source? I&#39;ve been looking all over, I found one but it doesn&#39;t exactly work right :\ So does anyone have any others? Or a tutorial on how to make the webclient&#39;s auto cache show progress?</description>
