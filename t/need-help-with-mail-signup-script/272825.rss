    <title>Need Help with Mail/Signup Script</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-mail-signup-script/272825</link>
    <description>Hey everyone.

I want/need a script for a website i have recently done. I want to add a sign-up option on the front page where you simply enter your email adress and press enter then their email to be added to a database.

For example if there was a website named www.Freebentley.co.uk and you can register by typing in your email and presing enter.

If you know about these scripts like know the name of one or even have one! can you please post or mail me :D

Thank you very very much!

<p>I’d watch who you talk to like that. Personally I feel the urge for beating the shit out of you right now. You don’t know me and you don’t know half of what I can do or the people I know. I don’t take shit from anybody. Note if you make another smart comment about me like that you could end up in serious trouble. There is a list of people I know who live close to you that wouldn’t mind setting a few things straight for me. I don’t mean to terrorise but this is a threat.</p>
<p>All I did was point you in the right direction hoping that you would be able to use what I gave you to look up some tutorials. I’m not a teacher and don’t expect anyone else here to be one either. Most of the people here sort things out for themselves with just a few tips. Why should you be the special one and receive all the attention?</p>

              <p>okey… let me make something very clear Blapmanjr… you do NOT come here and expect people to make or go look for scripts for you. infact if you used google read some of the stuff to do with this you could do it all by your self, but no, Obviously your to lazy to even attempt to learn anything. So my advice to you is;</p>
<p>a) Grow the fuck up, You may be 15. But your acting like a 10 year old.<br>
b) Go actually look on google for some tutorials to do with php, a good site is <a href="http://www.phpvideotutorials.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.phpvideotutorials.com</a><br>
c) go talk to someone about puberty, i think it may be fucking up your head.<br>
d) have some respect for people who actually try and help onlyonerule gave you a working script, obviously you don’t know the 1st thing that is needed to even work with php or you could have easley worked out what to do with that.<br>
e) stop being so god dam lazy, your lucky you got that much help. Personally i would have redirected you to the good old site called Google.<br>
f) GTFO -&gt;</p>
