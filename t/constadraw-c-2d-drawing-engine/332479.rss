    <title>ConstaDraw - C# 2D Drawing Engine</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/constadraw-c-2d-drawing-engine/332479</link>
    <description>This is a small drawing engine I started writing last night to draw Gameboy-like games (Which would explain the default window size) in C# without the use of DirectX, OpenGL, or something else, as these are all highly incompatible. Instead, it uses the GDI+ to produce the best results possible, or run just like the Gameboy. Of course, I don&#39;t believe this is completely optimized, but it sure makes one hell of a difference.

So here&#39;s how it works. There&#39;s two buffers. One is a background, which is used for drawing maps or just something in the background, which really speeds it up later on. This by default does not support transparency. Anyway, it&#39;s drawn unmodified and doesn&#39;t get cleared after redrawing. However, the other buffer, the surface, does. This one DOES support transparency (Magenta. It does not use an alpha channel as this would conflict with the back buffer) and after every redraw, it&#39;s cleared.

After both buffers are ready to be drawn, a regular .NET Bitmap is created. Unsafe code allows the use of directly modifying its data, so it just copies the back buffer to it. Then, the surface area buffer is copied, and magenta-colored pixels are skipped. Since the graphics object for our window will never change (Unless of course, you make it), the one created on start-up is used and it draws the final image.

The testing code is a little sloppy, but everything is self-explanatory. Don&#39;t question how to use this, and if you do, it&#39;s clearly not for you. Later, I&#39;ll be expanding this and creating a full game engine, but for now, you can just play with this. The frame rate depends on the interval of the first timer, which is set to 30 by default.

The description attribute was supposed to come up in the intellisense, but then I realized it used XML. I was too lazy to change it. DirectX has been very incompatible for me when having other users run, and I had to create a batch file to register the primary DirectX files into the GCA.

And it’s called the GAC.<br>
If the user has the directx 9 redist installed your app will run.[/quote]Sorry, it was a typo. I remember trying SlimDX and it giving me some sort of error when I tried to use it, similar to the one XNA though. It was a while ago so I don’t remember.</p>

              <p>This is a small drawing engine I started writing last night to draw Gameboy-like games (Which would explain the default window size) in C# without the use of DirectX, OpenGL, or something else, as these are all highly incompatible. Instead, it uses the GDI+ to produce the best results possible, or run just like the Gameboy. Of course, I don’t believe this is completely optimized, but it sure makes one hell of a difference.</p>
<p>So here’s how it works. There’s two buffers. One is a background, which is used for drawing maps or just something in the background, which really speeds it up later on. This by default does not support transparency. Anyway, it’s drawn unmodified and doesn’t get cleared after redrawing. However, the other buffer, the surface, does. This one DOES support transparency (Magenta. It does not use an alpha channel as this would conflict with the back buffer) and after every redraw, it’s cleared.</p>
<p>After both buffers are ready to be drawn, a regular .NET Bitmap is created. Unsafe code allows the use of directly modifying its data, so it just copies the back buffer to it. Then, the surface area buffer is copied, and magenta-colored pixels are skipped. Since the graphics object for our window will never change (Unless of course, you make it), the one created on start-up is used and it draws the final image.</p>

<p>The testing code is a little sloppy, but everything is self-explanatory. Don’t question how to use this, and if you do, it’s clearly not for you. Later, I’ll be expanding this and creating a full game engine, but for now, you can just play with this. The frame rate depends on the interval of the first timer, which is set to 30 by default.</p>
