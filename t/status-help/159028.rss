    <description>Ok, I know a lot of people are having these problems with the server status page, but none of them seem to be answering my question. My question is when I add my server and everything, it says you only get to post one server when I haven&#39;t posted a server for over a week! I know this seems kinda noobish of me for asking this, but it is in the right section because I looked before I posted it. Please help because mmy server is getting more and more less popular!</description>
