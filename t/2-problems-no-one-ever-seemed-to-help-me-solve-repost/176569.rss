    <description>sorry again that i accidently posted in the downlaods by accident i will not do that again i will read next time :) 
anyways back to my problem


ive been posting this over and over and over and i cant seem to get support

the first one is how do you make specs cause i need the specs for my godswords

and the second  one is my npcs arent dieing and dropping items properly
i mean the npc soldier drop stuff is in item2.java but everytime i kill a barrow brother or a man it either
A. after its drained to 0 hp it just stands there and does nothing
B. it dissappears and doesnt drop properly
please fix this i want these 2 things solved</description>
