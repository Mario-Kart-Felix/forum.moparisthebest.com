    <description>Hello guys, Last week I was searching on the web to find diferent minecraft servers to try. Then I found this amazing server called Verincraft (IP: www.verincraft.net ). This server includes all the thing I had been looking for since weeks.
These amazing things are:
-Anarchy server (You are able to do all what you want except hacking)
-You can PvP.
-You can Raid and Grief.
-There Are Factions and Shops where you can buy things.
-You can repair your enchanted stuff for in-game money.
-There are a lot of more plugins such as warps and zones.
-The admins and the staff is nice and they will give you all the support you need.

Check the website at www.verincraft.com to read about rules or post on the forums.
Hope to see you guys in the server
