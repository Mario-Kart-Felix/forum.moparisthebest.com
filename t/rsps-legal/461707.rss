    <title>Rsps = Legal?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-legal/461707</link>
    <description>Dear moparscapers,

Maybe my title could&#39;ve been better, but yeah..
Okay so my question is to what point is making an rsps legal? Like can you make your rsps and just put it online with it being legal? Or is every rsps that&#39;s online illegal? For all the time I&#39;ve been coding I really wondered if it was legal. Another question is, How about the RS 2006 sites. These are being recreated. Are these legal to use for any server or are they illegal. These questions may look stupid but I really don&#39;t know the answer to it.
Hope someone can help me with this,

I was just going off what I was told a while ago on the copyright part but whatever.  Servers are still up for the same reason people are still able to pirate games, there’s way to many to do any effective control on all of them.</p>

<p>You’re an idiot. Jagex doesn’t have the time or patience to pursue legal action against every single private server. They usually only do this when a private server make’s alot of money, which to them is stealing their revenue.</p>

As a result of increasing legal integration and harmonisation throughout the European Union a complete picture of the law can only be acquired through recourse to EU jurisprudence, although this is likely to change in the near future when the UK leaves the...</p>

<p>Servers like Hyperion, Apollo, RuneSource, (one of sinisouls many), RS377, RS2dv, RS2HD, or any other frameowork created with out the use of either the Stream or Cryption class are legal with the exception of the protocol witch isn’t really something Jagex has gone after people about.</p>

<p>No. If a server gets to big, Jagex takes it down for using their client and cache, which they can’t do because the copyright is far expired for the 317 revision. Their ideas aren’t copyrighted either. So idk what you’re talking about…</p>

If I host a server on a vps, Jagex cannot interfere as I own the actual server. If I host the cache on a webserver, they can interfere as they own the cache. Have you noticed how servers with webclients get taken down whilst those without rarely do?<br>

<p>Yes, those too. The cache is Jagex’s property, not the server.</p>
