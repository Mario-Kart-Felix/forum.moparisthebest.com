    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-animate-feet-help-needed-with-pics/264743</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the weight I used or the pri either way my feet arn&#39;t attatched to my legs. 

I changed the model MPQ from straight legged, just how I got it from the RS cache, I just thought I would try it - and I am now out of options, I would be very greatful if somebody could give me a hint as to what I am doing wrong.

Here&#39;s the problem...

<p>But anyway, there is a strict positioning used in runescape to make sure that this type of thing doesn’t happen, which means when you make a pair of legs, the ankles MUST be positioned to match all of the possible feet in runescape.<br>
You just can’t go moving the ankles to new positions and hope the feet will follow, it doesn’t work like that.<br>
You could make new feet that are placed under your new ankle positions, but then these feet won’t fit any other legs in runescape.</p>
<p>You see the problems with doing this?</p>
<p>One, solution to doing what you want, is to model new feet, and get the server to switch the feet only when you wear those trousers, and then when you remove the trousers, switch back to normal feet. But that’s a server issue, not a client issue.</p>
<p>Another solution is to modify the animations so that when you wear those trousers, you stand just like that, but again, it becomes a server issue to set the correct animation.[/quote]</p>
<p>Very informative, thanks. I will probably go with the modeling new feet option, it seems to make a little bit more sence.</p>
<p>I think I am way in over my head, but I’ll give it a go.</p>
