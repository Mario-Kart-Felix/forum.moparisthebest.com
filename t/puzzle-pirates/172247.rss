    <description>So far all i have found is a bilger and i made a treasure hauler, can any one make any of the following?
Sword Fighter
Gunner
Sailer

For those who don&#39;t play puzzle pirates, il explain a each a little.

Sword fighting is like tetris, sept you break colors not rows, the bigger a block you make, like 2x2/2x3/3x3 etc... the bigger the sword it sends at your opponent. and to break, you have to ex, hit a red block with a red sword, there are red blue yellow and green pieces. And the easiest way to win is to get a combo, 4 in a row will get you a bingo. And to move you click left or right, up and down rotate the peices, they come down in pairs of two.

Gunner, there are four guns, and there is a barrel some where on the deck, the barrel lets out water/powder/wad/shot, you have to clean the gun out with water if you mess up and put the stuff in the wrong order or if its full of gunk from being fired. the order is powder/wad/shot. To control the moving supplies you click w,s,d,a to point the arrow in the direction you want then hit x or click to place it, you can have up to three on screen at a time and the pieces will go the direction the arrow is pointing if htey hit it.

Sailing, its a tall narrow screen, there are yellow, blue, and gray pieces. The goal is to eliminate the little platforms, it will be 2x2 or 2x3 or like

[b][y][g]
or the opposite way, you use the arrows to move the pieces and press up/down to rotate them. You have to get the colors to match up and they come in pairs of two, but they stick together until one or the other is eliminated. If you eliminate one and a piece that was on top of it eliminates another, well yea, thats a combo and they score big.</description>
