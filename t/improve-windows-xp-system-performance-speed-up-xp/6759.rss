    <description>[center][size=15pt]Guide To Speed Up Windows Xp[/size][/center]

[glow=blue,2,300][u]Step 1 - AntiVirus[/u][/glow]

[size=9pt]Computer Viruses not only reduce system performance but they have the potential to destroy data and allow a third party complete control over your computer. No PC today should be running without an updated AntiVirus program. Updated means that the AntiVirus program should have a current virus pattern, reference or definition file from within the last seven days. E-mailing, file sharing, disk sharing, and simply browsing the Internet can all potentially cause a computer virus infection.[/size]

[b]Trend Micro Online Virus Scanner[/b] - [url=http://housecall.trendmicro.com/]Home Page[/url]
[size=9pt]A free online Virus Scanner that can be run anytime a Virus infection is suspected. [/size] 

[size=9pt][i]Instructions[/i] - Select &quot;Scan Now. It&#39;s Free!&quot;, then again. Check &quot;Yes, I accept the Terms of Use&quot; and select &quot;Launching HouseCall&quot;, then select &quot;Starting HouseCall&quot; (Java or Browser Plug-in) and wait. Then select &quot;Next&quot; (Scan complete computer for malware, grayware and vulnerabilities) and wait (this may take some time). For any Viruses that cannot be cleaned or deleted use the Sysclean Package below. Even if you have an AntiVirus program installed run this anyway. If you do not, then get Avast! Free AntiVirus is below.[/size]

[b]Avast! Home Edition[/b] - [url=http://www.avast.com/eng/down_home.html]Download[/url] - [url=http://www.avast.com/i_kat_207.php?lang=ENG]Register[/url]
[size=9pt]A free AntiVirus Program for those who do not already own a good one such as Trend Micro&#39;s PC-Cillin, McAfee or Norton AntiVirus. Avast Home Edition includes full virus protection in an easy to use interface with free automatic updating. If you already have a good antivirus program do not install this but confirm that yours is updated. (e-mail registration is required)[/size]
[u]
[glow=blue,2,300]Step 2 - AntiSpyware[/glow][/u]

[size=9pt]Spyware - Hidden software that gathers information about a computer user without the user&#39;s knowledge or informed consent, and then transmits this information to an external entity. This also includes Malware products which perform the delivery of unrequested advertising (Pop-ups in particular), re-routing page requests to illegally claim commercial site referral fees, and installing stealth phone dialers.[/size]

[b][u]Spyware Cleaning[/u][/b]
[size=9pt]The following free scanners will remove 99% of known Spyware. Ad-aware, and Spybot should be updated weekly.[/size]

[b]CCleaner[/b] - [url=http://www.ccleaner.com/download/builds.aspx]Download[/url]
[size=9pt]CCleaner removes unused and temporary files from your system, including cleaning the registry.

[i]Instructions[/i] - Download the Basic or Slim versions and install. Go to the &quot;Windows&quot; tab, uncheck &quot;Old Prefetch Data&quot; then select &quot;Run Cleaner&quot;. Next select the &quot;Applications&quot; tab and select &quot;Run Cleaner&quot;. Finally select the &quot;Issues&quot; button and select &quot;Scan for Issues&quot; when it finishes scanning select &quot;Fix Selected Issues&quot;, then &quot;Fix All Selected Issues&quot;.[/size]

[b]Ad-aware SE[/b] - [url=http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/Adaware_SE_Personal/965718306/1]Download[/url]
[size=9pt]Application to scan and remove Spyware, Adware, hijackers and other malicious software.

[i]Instructions[/i] - Install, Update and Run. Select &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;Perform Full System Scan&quot;, &quot;Next&quot; and Remove all Spyware items it finds. To select all items for removal right-click on any of the found items and left-click &quot;Select All&quot;. Tough to remove Spyware requires a more thorough scan. Reboot your computer into safe mode by pressing the F8 key down during boot up and selecting &quot;Safe Mode&quot; from the Windows Advanced Options menu. In safe mode do another Ad-aware scan and remove the remaining Spyware infections.[/size] 

[b] Spybot[/b][b] - Search and Destroy[/b] - [url=http://www.safer-networking.org/en/mirrors/index.html]Download[/url]
[size=9pt]Application to scan and remove Spyware, Adware, hijackers and other malicious software.

[i]Instructions[/i] - Install Spybot (Do not install the Teatimer), select &quot;Update&quot;, &quot;Search For Updates&quot;, check the box next to each update and then select &quot;Download Updates&quot; Then select &quot;Search and Destroy&quot;, &quot;Check for problems&quot; and after scanning is complete &quot;Fix selected problems&quot;. Tough to remove Spyware requires a more thorough scan. Reboot your computer into safe mode by pressing the F8 key down during boot up and selecting &quot;Safe Mode&quot; from the Windows Advanced Options menu. In safe mode do another Spybot scan and remove the remaining Spyware infections.[/size]

[u][glow=blue,2,300]Step 3 - Tweaks[/glow][/u]

[b]1. [b]Improve Windows XP Performance[/b][/b]
[size=9pt]Default Windows XP visual settings may look nice but they slow down system responsiveness. Here is how to keep the &quot;look&quot; of Windows XP while losing the sluggish feel.[/size]

[size=9pt][i]Instructions[/i] - Go to &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;Settings&quot;, &quot;Control Panel&quot;, &quot;System&quot;, &quot;Advanced&quot; tab, in the &quot;Performance&quot; section select &quot;Settings&quot;. Leave only the following checked:[/size]

[size=9pt][b]Show shadows under menus
Show shadows under mouse pointer
Show translucent selection rectangle
Use drop shadows for icons labels on the desktop
Use visual styles on windows and buttons[/b][/size]

[size=9pt]Then select &quot;Apply&quot; and &quot;OK&quot;.[/size]

[b]2. [b]Disable Indexing Service[/b][/b]
[size=9pt]The Indexing Service in Windows XP indexes your files presumably to shorten the time needed to search your hard drive if you are looking for a specific file or part of a phrase inside a file. However, the constant indexing of files actually slows down system performance and does not benefit search performance except for extreme complex searches.[/size]

[size=9pt][i]Instructions [/i] - To disable the Indexing Service go into &quot;My Computer&quot;, right-click on all your hard drive partitions one at a time, left-click &quot;Properties&quot;. Uncheck &quot;Allow Indexing Service to index this disk for fast file searching&quot;. Select &quot;Apply changes to subfolders and files&quot;. If any files cannot be updated select &quot;Ignore All&quot;.[/size]

[b]3. [b]Disable Windows XP Sounds[/b][/b]
[size=9pt]Having sound effects set for common Windows XP tasks slows your system. This affects startup and shutdown speeds the most. 

[i]Instructions[/i] - To disable all Windows XP task sounds go to &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;Settings&quot;, &quot;Control Panel&quot;, &quot;Sounds and Audio Devices&quot;, select the &quot;Sounds&quot; tab, under &quot;Sound Scheme&quot; select &quot;No Sounds&quot;.[/size]

[b]4. [b]Uninstall Useless Windows Components[/b][/b]
[size=9pt]Windows XP installs some components by default that are not needed.

[i]Instructions[/i] - Go to &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;Settings&quot;, &quot;Control Panel&quot;, &quot;Add or Remove Programs&quot;, select &quot;Add/Remove Windows Components&quot;, uncheck:

_ [b]Indexing Service[/b]
_ [b]MSN Explorer[/b] (If you use MSN as your Internet Service Provider then leave &quot;MSN Explorer&quot; checked)

Then select &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Finished&quot;.[/size]

[b]5. Reduce Recycling Bin Drive Space Usage[/b]
[size=9pt]In Windows XP the Maximum size of the Recycle Bin is set by default to 10% of your hard drive, when full, this can be a big waste of drive space. Reducing the Maximum size prevents excess space from being wasted.

[i]Instructions[/i] - To change the Recycling Bin Size, right-click on the &quot;Recycle Bin&quot;, left-click on &quot;Properties&quot;, select the &quot;Global&quot; tab, then &quot;Use one setting for all drives&quot;. Move the slider to &quot;3%&quot; or &quot;4%&quot;.[/size]

[b]6. Reduce System Restore Drive Space Usage[/b]
[size=9pt]System Restore creates periodic snapshots of your critical system files and stores them as a &quot;restore point.&quot; In case something goes wrong with your system you can revert back to a previous working state. The default size that System Restore can take up can be quite large.

[i]Instructions[/i] - Go to &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;Control Panel&quot;, &quot;System&quot;, &quot;System Restore&quot; tab, for each drive partition highlight it then select &quot;Settings&quot;, under &quot;Drive Space Usage&quot; adjust the slider so System Restore is only using roughly 5% or a minimum of 1000 MB of disk space per partition and select &quot;OK&quot;.[/size]

[b]7. Prefetcher Fix[/b] - [url=http://home.comcast.net/~optimizexp/Files/Prefetcher_Fix.zip]Download[/url]
[size=9pt]Prefetching is a new feature in Windows XP that dramatically improves initial application load times and Windows boot times automatically. The slower your system and the larger an application, the more Prefetching helps. Even high end systems benefit from prefetching with large, slow loading applications, such as large games.

[i]Instructions[/i] - Download, unzip and run the &quot;Prefetcher Fix.reg&quot; file and reboot. This will restore the Windows Prefetcher to it&#39;s default and optimal state. It will also set the Task Scheduler Service to Automatic.

[b]- Task Scheduler[/b] - Automatic

Then use Windows Explorer and look in the [b]C:\WINDOWS\Prefetch[/b] folder. You should see a file name for any application you have started since Prefetching was enabled. Never clean this folder or disable Windows Prefetching with any &quot;tweaks&quot; as you will cripple your application load times and Windows boot times by as much as 100%.[/size]

[glow=blue,2,300][u]Step 4 - Utilities[/u][/glow]

[b]Chkdsk[/b]
[size=9pt]Built-in Windows file system repair utility.

[i]Instructions[/i] - Go to &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;My Computer&quot;, right-click on the &quot;C:&quot; drive, left-click &quot;Properties&quot;, select the &quot;Tools&quot; tab, click &quot;Check Now...&quot;, check &quot;Automatically Fix File System Errors&quot;, then click &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot; and Reboot. Repeat this for any other hard drive partitions in your system. Only the drive partition with Windows installed will require a reboot.[/size]

[b]Disk Defragmenter[/b]
[size=9pt]Built-in Windows defragmenter. While &quot;Disk Defragmenter&quot; is better then nothing it does not fully optimize your hard drive performance. There are no Free Defragmenters that do a better job, in which case you have to purchase a Commercial Defragmenter such as [url=http://www.diskeeper.com/diskeeper/home/diskeeper.asp?RId=778]Diskeeper[/url].

[i]Instructions[/i] - Double-click &quot;My Computer&quot;, right-click the local disk volume that you want to defragment, Example: Local Disk (C:), and then left-click &quot;Properties&quot;. On the &quot;Tools&quot; tab, select &quot;Defragment Now&quot;, then &quot;Defragment&quot;.[/size]

[glow=blue,2,300][u]Step 5 - Services [/u] [/glow]

[size=9pt]Windows XP has extra services running by default that most people will never use. By disabling these services you will improve system performance such as boot times.

[i]Instructions[/i] - Go to &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;Control Panel&quot;, &quot;Administrative Tools&quot;, &quot;Services&quot;. Left-click on the status bar twice to filter all the started service to the top. Double left-click on the Service Name you wish to change. Change the &quot;Startup Type&quot; to either Manual or Automatic, then select &quot;Apply&quot; and &quot;OK&quot;, repeat for all of the following:

The following is a list of Services that you can [b]Disable[/b]on most systems to increase performance:[/size]

[size=9pt][b]Alerter
Distributed Link Tracking Client[/b]
[b]Help and Support [/b] - (If you use Windows Help and Support leave this enabled)
[b]Indexing Service
IPSEC Services[/b][b]Messenger[/b]
[b]Portable Media Serial Number
Remote Registry Service
Secondary Logon
SSDP Discovery Service[/b]
[b]Telnet
Upload Manager
Wireless Zero Configuration [/b] - (If you are on a wireless network leave this enabled)[/size]

[size=9pt]The following is a list of Services that should always be set to [b]Automatic[/b]:[/size]

[size=9pt][b]Automatic Updates [/b] - (Required by Windows Updates)
[b]Background Intelligent Transfer Service[/b] - (Required by Windows Updates)
[b]COM+ Event System[/b] - (Required by BootVis and other Applications)
[b]Cryptographic Services[/b] - (Required to confirm the signature of Windows system files, Protected Root Services and Key Services)
[b]DCOM Server Process Launcher [/b] - (Required by Disk Defragmenter)
[b]DHCP Client[/b] - (Required for Cable/DSL connections and Routers)
[b]DNS Client[/b] - (Improves Internet Performance)
[b]Event Log[/b] - (Required by Windows and cannot be Stopped)
[b]Logical Disk Manager[/b] - (Required to manage and update your Harddrives)
[b]Network Connections [/b] - (Required by Network Connections)
[b]Plug and Play[/b] - (Required by your System Hardware, Never Disable This!)
[b]Print Spooler [/b] - (Required by Printers)
[b]Protected Storage[/b] - (Required to protected sensitive data and to prevent access by unauthorized services, processes, or users.)
[b]Remote Procedure Call (RPC)[/b] - (Required by Windows, Never Disable This!)
[b]Security Accounts Manager [/b] - (Required to store security information for local user accounts)
[b]Security Center[/b] - (Notifies you of you Firewall and AntiVirus Status)
[b]Shell Hardware Detection [/b] - (Required by the AutoPlay feature)
[b]System Event Notification [/b] - (Required by various Applications)
[b]System Restore Service[/b] - (Required by the System Restore feature)
[b]Task Scheduler[/b] - (Required by the Windows Prefetcher, BootVis and Norton AV, Never Disable This!)
[b]Themes[/b] - (Required by the new look of Windows XP)
[b]Windows Audio[/b] - (Required for Sound)
[b]Windows Management Instrumentation [/b] - (Required by Windows, Never Disable This!)[/size]

[size=9pt][i]Notes [/i] - Windows Updates can enable services that you have previously disabled. Check which services are running after a future Windows Update is completed. If applications stop working after using this guide it is usually due to being to aggressive with disabling services. Enable the services you disabled one at a time until the application works.[/size]

[center][size=9pt][b]Hope this guide helps, took a long time.
If anyone knows any other techniques that can help improve your systems performance, please tell me and I will add it to this guide.[/b][/size][/center]</description>

              <p>[center][size=15pt]Guide To Speed Up Windows Xp[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[glow=blue,2,300]<span class="bbcode-u">Step 1 - AntiVirus</span>[/glow]</p>
<p>[size=9pt]Computer Viruses not only reduce system performance but they have the potential to destroy data and allow a third party complete control over your computer. No PC today should be running without an updated AntiVirus program. Updated means that the AntiVirus program should have a current virus pattern, reference or definition file from within the last seven days. E-mailing, file sharing, disk sharing, and simply browsing the Internet can all potentially cause a computer virus infection.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Trend Micro Online Virus Scanner</span> - <a href="http://housecall.trendmicro.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Home Page</a><br>
[size=9pt]A free online Virus Scanner that can be run anytime a Virus infection is suspected. [/size]</p>
<p>[size=9pt]<span class="bbcode-i">Instructions</span> - Select “Scan Now. It’s Free!”, then again. Check “Yes, I accept the Terms of Use” and select “Launching HouseCall”, then select “Starting HouseCall” (Java or Browser Plug-in) and wait. Then select “Next” (Scan complete computer for malware, grayware and vulnerabilities) and wait (this may take some time). For any Viruses that cannot be cleaned or deleted use the Sysclean Package below. Even if you have an AntiVirus program installed run this anyway. If you do not, then get Avast! Free AntiVirus is below.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Avast! Home Edition</span> - <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/down_home.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Download</a> - <a href="http://www.avast.com/i_kat_207.php?lang=ENG" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Register</a><br>
[size=9pt]A free AntiVirus Program for those who do not already own a good one such as Trend Micro’s PC-Cillin, McAfee or Norton AntiVirus. Avast Home Edition includes full virus protection in an easy to use interface with free automatic updating. If you already have a good antivirus program do not install this but confirm that yours is updated. (e-mail registration is required)[/size]<br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><br>
[glow=blue,2,300]Step 2 - AntiSpyware[/glow]</span></p>
<p>[size=9pt]Spyware - Hidden software that gathers information about a computer user without the user’s knowledge or informed consent, and then transmits this information to an external entity. This also includes Malware products which perform the delivery of unrequested advertising (Pop-ups in particular), re-routing page requests to illegally claim commercial site referral fees, and installing stealth phone dialers.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Spyware Cleaning</span></span><br>
[size=9pt]The following free scanners will remove 99% of known Spyware. Ad-aware, and Spybot should be updated weekly.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">CCleaner</span> - <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/download/builds.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Download</a><br>
[size=9pt]CCleaner removes unused and temporary files from your system, including cleaning the registry.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Instructions</span> - Download the Basic or Slim versions and install. Go to the “Windows” tab, uncheck “Old Prefetch Data” then select “Run Cleaner”. Next select the “Applications” tab and select “Run Cleaner”. Finally select the “Issues” button and select “Scan for Issues” when it finishes scanning select “Fix Selected Issues”, then “Fix All Selected Issues”.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Ad-aware SE</span> - <a href="http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/Adaware_SE_Personal/965718306/1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Download</a><br>
[size=9pt]Application to scan and remove Spyware, Adware, hijackers and other malicious software.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Instructions</span> - Install, Update and Run. Select “Start”, “Perform Full System Scan”, “Next” and Remove all Spyware items it finds. To select all items for removal right-click on any of the found items and left-click “Select All”. Tough to remove Spyware requires a more thorough scan. Reboot your computer into safe mode by pressing the F8 key down during boot up and selecting “Safe Mode” from the Windows Advanced Options menu. In safe mode do another Ad-aware scan and remove the remaining Spyware infections.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"> Spybot</span><span class="bbcode-b"> - Search and Destroy</span> - <a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/mirrors/index.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Download</a><br>
[size=9pt]Application to scan and remove Spyware, Adware, hijackers and other malicious software.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Instructions</span> - Install Spybot (Do not install the Teatimer), select “Update”, “Search For Updates”, check the box next to each update and then select “Download Updates” Then select “Search and Destroy”, “Check for problems” and after scanning is complete “Fix selected problems”. Tough to remove Spyware requires a more thorough scan. Reboot your computer into safe mode by pressing the F8 key down during boot up and selecting “Safe Mode” from the Windows Advanced Options menu. In safe mode do another Spybot scan and remove the remaining Spyware infections.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">[glow=blue,2,300]Step 3 - Tweaks[/glow]</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1. <span class="bbcode-b">Improve Windows XP Performance</span></span><br>
[size=9pt]Default Windows XP visual settings may look nice but they slow down system responsiveness. Here is how to keep the “look” of Windows XP while losing the sluggish feel.[/size]</p>
<p>[size=9pt]<span class="bbcode-i">Instructions</span> - Go to “Start”, “Settings”, “Control Panel”, “System”, “Advanced” tab, in the “Performance” section select “Settings”. Leave only the following checked:[/size]</p>
<p>[size=9pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Show shadows under menus<br>
Show shadows under mouse pointer<br>
Show translucent selection rectangle<br>
Use drop shadows for icons labels on the desktop<br>
Use visual styles on windows and buttons</span>[/size]</p>
<p>[size=9pt]Then select “Apply” and “OK”.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2. <span class="bbcode-b">Disable Indexing Service</span></span><br>
[size=9pt]The Indexing Service in Windows XP indexes your files presumably to shorten the time needed to search your hard drive if you are looking for a specific file or part of a phrase inside a file. However, the constant indexing of files actually slows down system performance and does not benefit search performance except for extreme complex searches.[/size]</p>
<p>[size=9pt]<span class="bbcode-i">Instructions </span> - To disable the Indexing Service go into “My Computer”, right-click on all your hard drive partitions one at a time, left-click “Properties”. Uncheck “Allow Indexing Service to index this disk for fast file searching”. Select “Apply changes to subfolders and files”. If any files cannot be updated select “Ignore All”.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">3. <span class="bbcode-b">Disable Windows XP Sounds</span></span><br>
[size=9pt]Having sound effects set for common Windows XP tasks slows your system. This affects startup and shutdown speeds the most.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Instructions</span> - To disable all Windows XP task sounds go to “Start”, “Settings”, “Control Panel”, “Sounds and Audio Devices”, select the “Sounds” tab, under “Sound Scheme” select “No Sounds”.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">4. <span class="bbcode-b">Uninstall Useless Windows Components</span></span><br>
[size=9pt]Windows XP installs some components by default that are not needed.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Instructions</span> - Go to “Start”, “Settings”, “Control Panel”, “Add or Remove Programs”, select “Add/Remove Windows Components”, uncheck:</p>
<p>_ <span class="bbcode-b">Indexing Service</span><br>
_ <span class="bbcode-b">MSN Explorer</span> (If you use MSN as your Internet Service Provider then leave “MSN Explorer” checked)</p>
<p>Then select “Next” and “Finished”.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">5. Reduce Recycling Bin Drive Space Usage</span><br>
[size=9pt]In Windows XP the Maximum size of the Recycle Bin is set by default to 10% of your hard drive, when full, this can be a big waste of drive space. Reducing the Maximum size prevents excess space from being wasted.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Instructions</span> - To change the Recycling Bin Size, right-click on the “Recycle Bin”, left-click on “Properties”, select the “Global” tab, then “Use one setting for all drives”. Move the slider to “3%” or “4%”.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">6. Reduce System Restore Drive Space Usage</span><br>
[size=9pt]System Restore creates periodic snapshots of your critical system files and stores them as a “restore point.” In case something goes wrong with your system you can revert back to a previous working state. The default size that System Restore can take up can be quite large.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Instructions</span> - Go to “Start”, “Control Panel”, “System”, “System Restore” tab, for each drive partition highlight it then select “Settings”, under “Drive Space Usage” adjust the slider so System Restore is only using roughly 5% or a minimum of 1000 MB of disk space per partition and select “OK”.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">7. Prefetcher Fix</span> - <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~optimizexp/Files/Prefetcher_Fix.zip" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Download</a><br>
[size=9pt]Prefetching is a new feature in Windows XP that dramatically improves initial application load times and Windows boot times automatically. The slower your system and the larger an application, the more Prefetching helps. Even high end systems benefit from prefetching with large, slow loading applications, such as large games.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Instructions</span> - Download, unzip and run the “Prefetcher Fix.reg” file and reboot. This will restore the Windows Prefetcher to it’s default and optimal state. It will also set the Task Scheduler Service to Automatic.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">- Task Scheduler</span> - Automatic</p>
<p>Then use Windows Explorer and look in the <span class="bbcode-b">C:\WINDOWS\Prefetch</span> folder. You should see a file name for any application you have started since Prefetching was enabled. Never clean this folder or disable Windows Prefetching with any “tweaks” as you will cripple your application load times and Windows boot times by as much as 100%.[/size]</p>
<p>[glow=blue,2,300]<span class="bbcode-u">Step 4 - Utilities</span>[/glow]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chkdsk</span><br>
[size=9pt]Built-in Windows file system repair utility.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Instructions</span> - Go to “Start”, “My Computer”, right-click on the “C:” drive, left-click “Properties”, select the “Tools” tab, click “Check Now…”, check “Automatically Fix File System Errors”, then click “Start”, “Yes” and Reboot. Repeat this for any other hard drive partitions in your system. Only the drive partition with Windows installed will require a reboot.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Disk Defragmenter</span><br>
[size=9pt]Built-in Windows defragmenter. While “Disk Defragmenter” is better then nothing it does not fully optimize your hard drive performance. There are no Free Defragmenters that do a better job, in which case you have to purchase a Commercial Defragmenter such as <a href="http://www.diskeeper.com/diskeeper/home/diskeeper.asp?RId=778" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Diskeeper</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Instructions</span> - Double-click “My Computer”, right-click the local disk volume that you want to defragment, Example: Local Disk (C:), and then left-click “Properties”. On the “Tools” tab, select “Defragment Now”, then “Defragment”.[/size]</p>
<p>[glow=blue,2,300]<span class="bbcode-u">Step 5 - Services </span> [/glow]</p>
<p>[size=9pt]Windows XP has extra services running by default that most people will never use. By disabling these services you will improve system performance such as boot times.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Instructions</span> - Go to “Start”, “Control Panel”, “Administrative Tools”, “Services”. Left-click on the status bar twice to filter all the started service to the top. Double left-click on the Service Name you wish to change. Change the “Startup Type” to either Manual or Automatic, then select “Apply” and “OK”, repeat for all of the following:</p>
<p>The following is a list of Services that you can <span class="bbcode-b">Disable</span>on most systems to increase performance:[/size]</p>
<p>[size=9pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Alerter<br>
Distributed Link Tracking Client</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Help and Support </span> - (If you use Windows Help and Support leave this enabled)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Indexing Service<br>
IPSEC Services</span><span class="bbcode-b">Messenger</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Portable Media Serial Number<br>
Remote Registry Service<br>
Secondary Logon<br>
SSDP Discovery Service</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Telnet<br>
Upload Manager<br>
Wireless Zero Configuration </span> - (If you are on a wireless network leave this enabled)[/size]</p>
<p>[size=9pt]The following is a list of Services that should always be set to <span class="bbcode-b">Automatic</span>:[/size]</p>
<p>[size=9pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Automatic Updates </span> - (Required by Windows Updates)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Background Intelligent Transfer Service</span> - (Required by Windows Updates)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">COM+ Event System</span> - (Required by BootVis and other Applications)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Cryptographic Services</span> - (Required to confirm the signature of Windows system files, Protected Root Services and Key Services)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">DCOM Server Process Launcher </span> - (Required by Disk Defragmenter)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">DHCP Client</span> - (Required for Cable/DSL connections and Routers)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">DNS Client</span> - (Improves Internet Performance)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Event Log</span> - (Required by Windows and cannot be Stopped)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Logical Disk Manager</span> - (Required to manage and update your Harddrives)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Network Connections </span> - (Required by Network Connections)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Plug and Play</span> - (Required by your System Hardware, Never Disable This!)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Print Spooler </span> - (Required by Printers)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Protected Storage</span> - (Required to protected sensitive data and to prevent access by unauthorized services, processes, or users.)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</span> - (Required by Windows, Never Disable This!)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Security Accounts Manager </span> - (Required to store security information for local user accounts)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Security Center</span> - (Notifies you of you Firewall and AntiVirus Status)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Shell Hardware Detection </span> - (Required by the AutoPlay feature)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">System Event Notification </span> - (Required by various Applications)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">System Restore Service</span> - (Required by the System Restore feature)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Task Scheduler</span> - (Required by the Windows Prefetcher, BootVis and Norton AV, Never Disable This!)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Themes</span> - (Required by the new look of Windows XP)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Windows Audio</span> - (Required for Sound)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Windows Management Instrumentation </span> - (Required by Windows, Never Disable This!)[/size]</p>
<p>[size=9pt]<span class="bbcode-i">Notes </span> - Windows Updates can enable services that you have previously disabled. Check which services are running after a future Windows Update is completed. If applications stop working after using this guide it is usually due to being to aggressive with disabling services. Enable the services you disabled one at a time until the application works.[/size]</p>
<p>[center][size=9pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Hope this guide helps, took a long time.<br>
If anyone knows any other techniques that can help improve your systems performance, please tell me and I will add it to this guide.</span>[/size][/center]</p>
