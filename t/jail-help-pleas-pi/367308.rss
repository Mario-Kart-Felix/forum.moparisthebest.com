    <description>i recently added a jail system and when i jail somebody they can still teleport out. i tried adding this in playerassistant.java
[code]		if(c.isInJail() - c.teleBlockDelay &lt; c.teleBlockLength) {
			c.sendMessage(&quot;You cannot teleport out of jail, are you retarded??&quot;);
			return;
		}[/code]

i tried to add that teleblock thing to it but when i compile it says it cannot be applied here is the error i get
[code]src\server\model\players\PlayerAssistant.java:1156: operator - cannot be applied
 to boolean,long
                if(c.isInJail() - c.teleBlockDelay &lt; c.teleBlockLength) {
                                ^
