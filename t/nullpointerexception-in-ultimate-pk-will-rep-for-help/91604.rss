    <title>nullPointerException in Ultimate PK WILL REP FOR HELP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nullpointerexception-in-ultimate-pk-will-rep-for-help/91604</link>
    <description>Hello.  I am creating a new server based on Ultimate PK, but a very strange thing happens whenever the server fails to find the connection vertex.  Instead of disconnecting like it should, it throws a nullPointerException and causes the server to crash.  I have tried multiple ways of making the offending client disconnect before it causes the error, but somehow it still manages to wreak havok before I can get rid of it.  This is the only error still happening on my server.  If I had it fixed it would run 24/7.  Also note that this only happens when the server has max players...  Any ideas?

Edit: Even stranger, it is always the client with slot 0 that the failure to find the connection vertex occurs to...

Edit 2: According to Xerocheez&#39;s comments, slot 0 is not handeled properly with the client.  I looked at the code to prevent slot 0 being used, but it is intact.  Why the heck is slot 0 being used??

Edit 3: Also after the nullpointerexception I get a lot of errors from player.postprocessing...[br][size=1]Posted on: May 08, 2007, 07:07:41 PM[/size][hr]I&#39;m desperate!  Someone help, anyone??</description>
