    <description>I think we have an X-rayer.
Summerwine1 greifed Dome city. 
The damage is minimal and Ill talk to him directly before making a post but its how the damage was done leads me to believe he&#39;s x-raying. He only knocked out blocks that had old unused tunnels behind them. No way he knew they were there other wise.
Just keep an eye on him.</description>

<p>So you’ve read <a href="http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,543062.msg3980344.html#new" data-bbcode="true">my suggestion</a>.</p>
<p>Why don’t I just edit that topic into a suggestions topic or you can get a mod to post it because I’ve got a bunch of ideas that I want to share. If you let people see that you’re allowing them give you input on their ideas then they might think that they are more apart of the community than they thought. Mostly because I’ve noticed that people are starting to drift away and the server is empty at least 2-5 times a day. You need to start opening up to some suggestions so that people will find the server fun again. Don’t get me wrong a ton of the ideas already implemented into the server are brilliant but it doesn’t look like anything else is going on. The server is fun every now and then but it could be amazing if there were things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weekly/monthly community activities, e.g. spleef time, treasure hunts etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Id be glad to hear a response on what you think about all these things. Thanks for reading</p>

<p>First, about your method of duping, I fixed one way already, do you have another that still currently works?<br>
[/quote]<br>
I’m not exactly sure on how to do it but I have successfully pulled it off 3 times. It has something to do with the world restarting. I have a hunch on how it can be done. You die, pick everything up and put it in a locked chest, don’t log off until the world forces you offline for a restart. Log back on and find that you have your items back. Yes its a slow one but can dupe a stack of diamond blocks. A fix? Find or create a mod that saves and boots them offline before the server restart?</p>
<p>Like I said I’m not entirely sure on how to pull it off but I know it can be done[/quote]</p>
