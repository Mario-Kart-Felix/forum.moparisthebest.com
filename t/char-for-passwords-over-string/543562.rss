    <title>Char[] for passwords over String?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/char-for-passwords-over-string/543562</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve only noticed this recently but swing uses char[] for passwords. I&#39;ve read online that it&#39;s better for security then using Strings because Strings are immutable and that the password would be present in memory where with an array you can completely get rid of it. 

Strings are also plain text which is easier for an attacker to read.

Simple example:

[code=java]pass = &quot;test&quot;;
print(pass);[/code]

[code=java]pass = &quot;test&quot;.toCharArray();
print(pass);[/code]

The first code would print the password where as the second code would print something @[2945}[ 

What are your opinions? 
Are there any better methods for passwords?</description>

C# has the same problem. They’ve provided a SecureString class to attempt to rectify it, but various APIs aren’t compatible with it so ultimately you end up converting it back to a string anyway.</p>
<p>Also, for your solution to have any value, you can’t start from a string literal (i.e., “Test”) and then convert it to a character array because by that stage you’ve already stored it as a String in memory.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Okay so how would you do it?[/quote]<br>
You don’t. The string language feature in java is immutable and inextensible. There’s nothing to be done about it as far as being a regular developer goes.</p>
<p>In an ideal world there would be a way built in to the language to mark a string as being secure when you create it. It would still be a string, and therefore still usable with the many APIs that exist. Basically the only difference would be that it receives special treatment - the garbage cleaner would overwrite it immediately after it falls out of scope.</p>
<p>As for the guys joking about ‘security and security and security’, there’s a reason it’s like that. There are no doubt countless stories of real-world lapses in security precisely because someone thought one security ‘thing’ was enough. Of course when that wall falls, whatever happens happens.<br>
By considering security throughout your entire network and system (i.e., from when permitted traffic enters through your firewall to when it receives an application layer response) you drastically reduce the likelihood of breaches.</p>

In my experience, just hashing the password and sending that for authentication isn’t good enough. What I’ve been using is an SRP-6a implementation along with RSA encryption. This also makes every login attempt never send the password, or the hash; Just the username and a random number.<br>

<p>Additional security. Is it necessary? No, but it doesn’t hurt. Especially is someone uses a number that isn’t quite big enough.</p>

<p>Yeah you’d have an issue but it would be best to reduce the risks. I would aim this mainly for clients because they’re more at risk. Rsps for example you’d want the password to be secure over the stream and secure on the users computer too.</p>

<p>In my experience, just hashing the password and sending that for authentication isn’t good enough. What I’ve been using is an SRP-6a implementation along with RSA encryption. This also makes every login attempt never send the password, or the hash; Just the username and a random number.</p>

memset?</p>
<p>Anyways you don’t want to keep the plaintext password in memory for long. After you hash it and compare to the value in the DB you’ll want to clear it. By using an array you can definitely clear out the memory as long as you don’t pass any String objects to your hash method.</p>
<p>A secure buffer would zero out the memory after it has been read, and preferably use some kind of native backing</p>
