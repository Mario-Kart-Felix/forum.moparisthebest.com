    <title>PayPal Auto Donate Web Sided Finished</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paypal-auto-donate-web-sided-finished/408619</link>
    <description>I have been working on a PHP Auto Donate System, Which is obviously the Web sided part and never had a good look into JAVA, So I don&#39;t know how to make the server sided.
All server sided will need to do is check the MySQL Database for the users username, give them their items if their in the database and then delete them or mark that row as &#39;Reward Claimed&#39; once they claim the reward.

You might be thinking, oh yeh, their is plenty of Auto Donation systems out there why would I help this guy make his, My answer to this is, I&#39;ve done the most difficult part and the other donation systems out there are pretty much CRAP and UNRELIABLE to be honest, they crash their host server.

I want to make a proper one that people will want to PAY for, whoever helps me gets my web sided.

Post below if your interested.

Thanks, Viality</description>
