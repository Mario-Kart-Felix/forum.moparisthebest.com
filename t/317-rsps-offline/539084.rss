    <title>317 RSPS offline</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-rsps-offline/539084</link>
    <description>Hey guys I&#39;m looking for a RSPS I can quickly download, change the JDK and run it working properly. My roommate and I are getting bored of other games and we just want to play a RSPS by ourselves. The only thing we&#39;re picky about is just we want a new(er) interface like when the emotes are pictures, not words. This is not a must, but if you also come across one with newer items such as torva, virtus, etc, I&#39;d like that. We don&#39;t get enough internet time to search for awhile so that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking. I do not plan on leeching and calling it my own, just want to play it offline with a friend.</description>

              <p>Try something 700+ as that will get you the most play time.</p>
<p>like Rune-Evo in the download section.</p>
<p>Also there’s a request section.</p>
