    <title>I can&#39;t concentrate</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-cant-concentrate/287334</link>
    <description>I have an essay due Wednesday, and a test. Most people decide to start early with this, but for some reason I started 2 hours ago. I tried to start with my essay several times over the weekend and last week, but I end up looking up subjects that aren&#39;t related to the subject of my essay. My essay is about economics and the auto-industry, I ended up browsing through schematics of antennas. This happens with a lot of things I do. I just lose my attention to everything I do. 

I play the guitar for a few weeks, even take lessons, but as soon as it becomes a tad bit difficult I lose my interest and quit. 
I used to play soccer, but we kept losing matches so I stopped going to soccer practice. 
I used to box, but after a few weeks I quit.
I played tennis, but after a few weeks I quit.
I bought supplies to build a guitar. It never got finished.
I have a piano. I played it for a week but I quit.
I quit games before I finish them.
I shift from one music genre to the other.
I start programming in Java, C, Python, Ruby. I get as far as arithmetics and quit.
I got interested in Latin, I quit learning it after a few days.
I got interested in Russian, see above.
I can&#39;t read or anything when I&#39;m in a room which has a tv which is turned on.
I have a gym subscription. I don&#39;t go there.

All the above is over a period of 2 years. It has cost a lot of money, and it pisses off my parents.

I know I have a lot of potential. When I was about 12 I had a test at school which is used to determine what level you can do. I scored the maximum.

And I can&#39;t be arsed to take any initiative. I planned to apply for a summer job. I didn&#39;t because I lost my attention while looking for a website. I tend to delay every school project. I&#39;m satisfied with just above average grades (I can do a lot better). I always plan to go jogging, but I never do.

So far I never had to do much work for school, and I always had good enough grades to go to the next year. But in about 4 years I&#39;ll have to get a real job, and with my attitude I won&#39;t get far. I know that I have this problem, but I can&#39;t fix it. I doubt it&#39;s ADHD, as I&#39;m not hyperactive or anything. I never get into any trouble.

So do you guys have any advice to help me focus on stuff that has to be done?</description>

ADHD is a real disorder and you are born with it, one explanation for it is reduced effect of Dopamine in your brain.</p>

<p>He sounds like me, lazy without motivation/initiative to do things.<br>
Try to get some motivation is my tip, btw don’t know how to get it.</p>

<p>Really the only thing you can do, is push yourself, make yourself do it. It helps to set goals, compete with others. When I lose sight of my goal, I have a friend who has the same goal remind me of what we’re trying to do.</p>
<p>Having someone rely on you, may or may not motivate you. If you don’t care about failing your friend, then that may not be so helpful. But really the littlest things make the biggest difference. Have you thought about talking to your councilor at your school? They can help retrain you to stay focused, and in the right direction.</p>

              <p>Holy shit, sounds like you just described me.<br>
The way I handle homework/papers/studying for tests etc is around 8 PM - 12 AM when I start my schoolwork I make a list of everything I have to do, and order it from short to long. I take care of the long stuff first, getting distracted for a couple hours while doing it generally, then around 2-3ish I close whatever game/project/book/other miscellaneous distraction I have open and finish the short stuff. Then, if it’s before 4 am I’ll play/whatever a bit more. Usually I try to go to bed by 4 AM, but that doesn’t work out so well… [summer vacation now though so I’m back to doing little productive work]</p>

              <p>I have an essay due Wednesday, and a test. Most people decide to start early with this, but for some reason I started 2 hours ago. I tried to start with my essay several times over the weekend and last week, but I end up looking up subjects that aren’t related to the subject of my essay. My essay is about economics and the auto-industry, I ended up browsing through schematics of antennas. This happens with a lot of things I do. I just lose my attention to everything I do.</p>
<p>I play the guitar for a few weeks, even take lessons, but as soon as it becomes a tad bit difficult I lose my interest and quit.<br>
I used to play soccer, but we kept losing matches so I stopped going to soccer practice.<br>
I used to box, but after a few weeks I quit.<br>
I played tennis, but after a few weeks I quit.<br>
I bought supplies to build a guitar. It never got finished.<br>
I have a piano. I played it for a week but I quit.<br>
I quit games before I finish them.<br>
I shift from one music genre to the other.<br>
I start programming in Java, C, Python, Ruby. I get as far as arithmetics and quit.<br>
I got interested in Latin, I quit learning it after a few days.<br>
I got interested in Russian, see above.<br>
I can’t read or anything when I’m in a room which has a tv which is turned on.<br>
I have a gym subscription. I don’t go there.</p>
<p>All the above is over a period of 2 years. It has cost a lot of money, and it pisses off my parents.</p>
<p>I know I have a lot of potential. When I was about 12 I had a test at school which is used to determine what level you can do. I scored the maximum.</p>
<p>And I can’t be arsed to take any initiative. I planned to apply for a summer job. I didn’t because I lost my attention while looking for a website. I tend to delay every school project. I’m satisfied with just above average grades (I can do a lot better). I always plan to go jogging, but I never do.</p>
<p>So far I never had to do much work for school, and I always had good enough grades to go to the next year. But in about 4 years I’ll have to get a real job, and with my attitude I won’t get far. I know that I have this problem, but I can’t fix it. I doubt it’s ADHD, as I’m not hyperactive or anything. I never get into any trouble.</p>
<p>So do you guys have any advice to help me focus on stuff that has to be done?</p>
