    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-tele-or-do-any-commands/224535</link>
    <description>When u try to tele or use any commands on my server nothing happens, the only thing you can do is walk and talk.

Idk what to do, has this happened to anyone else before?

If anyone knows how to fix this it will be greatly appreciated.
