A lot of people peacefully protest the olympics simply because they don't want their 6 billion dollars of taxes going towards sports, in a city with so many more important issues (east hastings, 'nuff said)

        <p>6 fucking billion? Don’t get me wrong, I support the Dutch Olympic team, but the money that goes into it is way too much. The main event of our team is speed-skating. Besides the fact that Canadians fucked up the ice, there is too much time between races because there are assholes that want commercials between every race. What’s up with that? Luckily, the public channel broadcasts the games in the Netherlands, which means no commercials at all!</p>
<p>I saw a report about the natives of Canada. While the Canadian government pumps a lot of money into the games, the natives live in shacks. Yet the opening ceremony was riddled with native symbols.</p>

I hear ya. The bit about the homeless people really pisses me off the most, because it happens here too. We throw money at countries like Haiti in times of disaster and need, or we throw money at world events like the olympics, winter olympics, world youth day, whatever, but we can’t spare the money for things like house production so that homeless can have safe places to stay that are affordable.<br>
It irks me to no end. The problem with humanity is that the only time people will be generous is when their generosity is going to be publicised. When that’s not the case, ‘fuck them – what do I care’.</p>
<p>But yeah, everyone in the world needs to get their priorities right, and I think most people need to evaluate their views on both homelessness (most of them are on the streets because of things like domestic abuse/sexual assault, or because they were laid off by their employer and are now too old to come by new work) and the displacement of homeless people.<br>
Anybody that has spent time on the streets has done so because there are no options left for them, and anyone that has had to seriously live on the streets doesn’t want to be there.<br>
Telling them to ‘fuck off elsewhere’ (displacing them) isn’t good enough when incredible amounts of money are being spent on things of no ‘real’ significance.</p>
<p>On another note, the bit about giving police the right to enter a premises to confiscate any anti-olympic ‘contraband’ is absurd. Who came up with that idea?<br>
Australia CAN best that policy maker’s stupidity though, with this fine piece of work: South Australia passed legislation making it illegal for people to post anonymously on forums regarding relevant elections, forcing people to post their full name and state of residence.<br>
This world is so fucked that it isn’t even funny.</p>

        <blockquote>The problem with humanity is that the only time people will be generous is when their generosity is going to be publicised. When that's not the case, 'fuck them -- what do I care'.</blockquote>
<p>If authenticity isn’t mainstream then how can authentic altruism ever become mainstream? The media constantly covers corny ass fake charitable motherfuckers, while those who actually speak up and stand up and confront the true problems in society honestly without regressing into an infantile fear of change are ignored. What if being a “Good person” suddenly became mainstream? Seems like technology has advanced far enough so everybody could be doing work that is both personally fulfilling and helpful to humanity and nobody really needs to be doing “Machine” jobs anymore. However there appears to be a certain comfort for some people in becoming a slave to the system of soulless profit, even to the point where charitable giving becomes a way to enhance ones personal brand. Why can’t people do the right thing? Why are people more attracted to the symbolism of charity/wealth/status than the actual thing? Do you ever get the feeling that Obama isn’t actually going to change anything?</p>
