    <title>A server with the entire world in it’s hands</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-server-with-the-entire-world-in-it-s-hands/393323</link>
    <description>Well now I guess I’m stuck on wanting to make an rsps, but I have a few questions:
1.  Can you use normal RS2 accounts on private servers
2.  Can you code an rsps to be able to use the entire world map
3.  How do you set up commands that you can use on an rsps
If you guys could help me answer these and maybe give me some advice on how to do them, that would be great.</description>

              <p>OK.  Well right now, I play on Battlescape’s webclient:<br>
Why cant I seem to access the entire world?<br>
And If you cant use normal rs2 accounts on private servers,  is there any way AT ALL to move rsps accounts to normal rs2?<br>
And as far commands go,  what are some common commands for private servers?</p>

<li>No. RSPS’s have nothing to do with runescape itself</li>
<li>Depends what revision you have. 317 doesn’t have all the new places added into rs recently</li>
<li>Delta commands in Client.java and PI commands in command.java (just do a search for it)</li>
</ol>
<p>There are lots of different commands and different ways of writing them so you will need to post specific commands if you want them. There’s lots of tutorials on here. Have a look at them.</p>

<p>Seems like you are a new coder. Please lookup many tutorials on how to get started. Then enjoy your stay at Mopar <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
