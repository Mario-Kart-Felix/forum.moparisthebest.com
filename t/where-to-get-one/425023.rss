why do all of you argue that any one of C, Java or C++ is worth throwing at a beginner? they’re all complex in their own ways, syntactically foreign compared to written language and can be painful to work with. ideally, set a beginner off with something to whet his appetite, ie. python or ruby and then introduce them to any one of the three. the transition will be easier for them, they’ll already have a good education of general programming in an easier language and it’s just smooth sailing.<br>

<p>Wouldn’t it be smarter to introduce them to programming with a language which has a complex syntax, like C++? Then it’ll be much easier to transition to a written language like Python, since you’ve already mastered the complexity of C++.[/quote]<br>
python has a complete syntax, it’s just very flexible and lexically logical to those who are not used to programming. i guess one could always argue that the harder to easier transition is more sensible, but you have to remember that beginners want results. python’s development times are very low, and it has a great bunch of libraries that effectively give you enough power to do everything.</p>

<p>Of course it’s easy to pick up an easier language when coming from a harder one. But why would anyone do this, especially when the easier language is impractical for most things? That would be like going to shovel shit after getting a master’s degree. I doubt anyone would spend several years mastering C++ and then turn to write garbage like python.[/quote]</p>
<p>10 years ago, that argument would be invalid since ‘scripting’ languages were still in their infancy and thus had pretty poor performance and no real gains. however, they’ve picked up fast and python is now used in so many places for so many things. how about send a letter to NASA or Google telling them how python is impractical <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>and, python isn’t really garbage… it does have a few flaws but when one is developing professionally you have to weigh up development times and availability of libraries compared to the actual elegance of the language. PHP is living proof of a shit language that made it big because it was easy to setup and had a decently sized library.</p>

why do all of you argue that any one of C, Java or C++ is worth throwing at a beginner? they’re all complex in their own ways, syntactically foreign compared to written language and can be painful to work with. ideally, set a beginner off with something to whet his appetite, ie. python or ruby and then introduce them to any one of the three. the transition will be easier for them, they’ll already have a good education of general programming in an easier language and it’s just smooth sailing.<br>

<p>Wouldn’t it be smarter to introduce them to programming with a language which has a complex syntax, like C++? Then it’ll be much easier to transition to a written language like Python, since you’ve already mastered the complexity of C++.[/quote]</p>
<p>Of course it’s easy to pick up an easier language when coming from a harder one. But why would anyone do this, especially when the easier language is impractical for most things? That would be like going to shovel shit after getting a master’s degree. I doubt anyone would spend several years mastering C++ and then turn to write garbage like python.</p>

<p>tell me, david, what exactly is so god damn hard about using C right when you start programming?  is it the small ass standard library and very few constructs, or the fact that C just scares the living shit out of you (for some other reason i have no idea about)…?  i already said this, but java throws so much at you, because it has…so much…</p>
<p>using java, you learn OOP first, which may slow down the process (use C, then C++ || java &amp;&amp; OOP)<br>
using java, you have a bloated library<br>
</p>
<p>yes, dealing with memory is hard, but honestly, i doubt anyone would even think about trying to mess with that at first.  you can do hard and confusing shit with java, and c, but it solely depends on what you do.  agree?  this is what i think, and i could care if you think what i think is stupid because it’s nothing like what you think.</p>
<p>this thread has a lot of good information.  good job.</p>
<p>ps: c and java have very alike syntax and grammar, so there’s no argument as to why one should be harder than the other referring to that reason, and that reason only.  something like brainfuck or LOLcode would be considerably hard, despite their small libraries as well; but like _s said, languages like python would be easier due to their not-so-strict grammar.</p>

<p>Personally I think most of Java is really self explanatory… maybe not some of the good design concepts, but the language and syntax couldn’t really get much simpler unless you go on to basic… I mean really, 99% of the time you are using words to describe exactly what is going on, or simple operands</p>
<p>This is obviously excluding the ambiguous concepts that cover most languages, like regex, but people usually learn those concepts separately anyways</p>

<p>High level first. Think of it like taking a car apart, you need to how the car works, and what parts are required to make the car run smoothly. Same concept carries to programming, if you attempt low-level language programming without knowing how abstraction works, then you won’t know why certain code is used/designed for appropriate functionality.</p>

<p>Again, read above. As far as people who “semi” know Java (you can’t semi know a language), they more than likely just use/follow tutorials by other members and assume that is what programming is. You can’t fault them for that, that would need to be something the higher ups would need to change.</p>

<p>I disagree completely, they wouldn’t get a better understanding from constant failure. If they develop a lazy style for implementation, or just don’t understand how machine level languages work then it would carry on and create massive problems in the end.</p>
<p>[quote=“The Enforcer, post:51, topic:425023”]When comparing language sizes the order goes like this: C, Java, C++. When comparing standard library sizes the order goes like this: C, C++, Java. However Java’s standard library is incredibly bloated.</p>
<p>I suggest learning C++ only if it’s going to be your main language, it’s huge and incredibly complex. You can’t be like “oh I’ll learn C++ and then I’ll learn Java”, if you have such plans you better skip C++, because it takes about 4 years to fully master it (Java -&gt; C++ makes more sense). C++ is of course a very nice and useful (and superior) language, and with the new C++11 standard memory management feels almost automatic.  :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Problem is the learning curve for C++ is still more trouble than its worth (at least for most). I can agree though, C++ does force you to take on a more stricter design since you’re handling memory and not relying on a garbage collector, which makes for better code and overall performance.</p>
