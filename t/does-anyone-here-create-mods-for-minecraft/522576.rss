    <title>Does anyone here create mods for minecraft?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anyone-here-create-mods-for-minecraft/522576</link>
    <description>I have an idea for a mc mod that&#39;s basically post-apocalyptic survival mode. But I know nothing of making mods so I can&#39;t do it so I&#39;m posting it here. 
There&#39;s a new mob called poachers, which are armed with custom items like a lead pipe or a baseball bat, and an interface that is a complete gamble. So if you run into a poacher( sometimes they are alone and sometimes in groups) you can talk to them. You have a 50% chance of them being neutral and a 50% chance of them being hostile and it&#39;s completely randomized. And to make it harder, if they turn hostile you won&#39;t be able to just run in your base and shut the door because they are able to tear down doors. 
They can also rob you. So if you go off away from your base you set up and you happen to have a chest there, it&#39;s possible for you to come back with your stuff stolen or maybe your entire base would just be torn apart.
And to make it even more realistic maybe there&#39;s some kind of method to record which items were stolen and then implement them into the drops for poachers and you might get lucky enough to get some of your stuff back if you kill the right ones. 
There would also be newly generated structures like run down buildings or just full scale abandoned cities or other bases that poachers have set up so its possible for you to steal from them too. 
And so it&#39;s not just another survival mode maybe you could have specific tasks that you have to complete in order to progress in the game. Like &quot;design a contraption to clean water safe for drinking&quot; or &quot;Find a base and steal ten pieces of food&quot; or something like that. 
And I had a few ideas for the actual survival aspect of it. 
1: You have a set amount of days and nights of surviving while you await a rescue team to pull you from the city. you only get one life. When your hunger bar goes down you don&#39;t just get brought down to half a heart. You die. And each day the difficulty increases. If you don&#39;t finish your tasks then the rescue team refuses to pick you up and the timer resets so you have to survive for the same set amount of days all over again and the difficulty is increased 2x
2: you form an alliance with some poachers and rebuild society but also have rival groups who make it difficult to accomplish and also have a set number of days to finish or you fail. 
3: just endlessly surviving the apocalypse to no end. 

Or you could also just make this into a SMP mod and the poachers would be other players. 

This is just an idea I had. I looked around and I couldn&#39;t find any mod like it. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong though, and feel free to post any opinions or other ideas on this. And if someone wants to create this, please do. Or if no one here does mods, feel free to pass the idea around if you like it. 

Edit: I forgot to mention that most items would be removed. Like diamond swords wouldn&#39;t exist but the equivalent would be something like a hammer. And red stone would be gone because I wouldn&#39;t imagine an apocalypse to retain electricity. Bonemeal is gone because its not that hard to plant wheat and instagrow it. Pretty much anything that can simplify the game would be gone.</description>
