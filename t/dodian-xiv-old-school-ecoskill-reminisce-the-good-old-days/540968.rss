    <description>[center][b][size=10pt][size=10pt]Dodian XIV[/size][/size][/b]

All Dodian Skills work!  Original Eco based Server!  Multiple bosses, never seen before! Barrows minigame!

This server is meant for the players who enjoyed Dodian when it was at its prime.  It does not have many of the features new servers have now&#39;a&#39;days but its still fun!  I started playing Dodian around 2007, so i have a lot of experience with the source.  I try to update the server everyday. Play yourself, and reminisce about the good old Dodian days!  If you enjoyed dodian, I promise XIV will not disappoint!
