You need to portforward these ports;<br>

I think that’s it. Then you need to have Wamp, set it up, copy the WWW folder into your C:/ drive in Wamp/www and then keep it always open. Download rscd.sql (sorry i didn’t include it in the server includes) and create a database called “rscd” then import rscd.sql when your in that database, and then secure the database with a password and the WWW and Server with a password. Then you have to get people to register up Twice in the forums (first is for forum account use, second is for server account).</p>
