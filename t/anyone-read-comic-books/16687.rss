    <title>Anyone read comic books?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-read-comic-books/16687</link>
    <description>My gf loves them and wanted me to get into them. I have looked at marvel&#39;s website and I looked at the wallpaper.
I liked Moon Knight and like 3 other&#39;s that had to do with the end of the world. (Or so it seemed)

<p>No offence, but I thought comic books are things that we used to read at age 5-6.[/quote]<br>
