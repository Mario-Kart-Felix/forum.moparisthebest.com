    <title>Help With Project 16 4.5 Sorce, How do you get magic pking?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-project-16-4-5-sorce-how-do-you-get-magic-pking/12801</link>
    <description>Well on the server I love pking but its only with range/melee and there is no mage, whenever you mage text comes up &quot;You are not in a pking area&quot; but we are around mage bank. So I wondering if there is a way to make magics work in the wilderness.

Note: I know chances are there is no way to do it but any help would be great.</description>
