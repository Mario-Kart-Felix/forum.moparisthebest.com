    <title>Visual Basic - Local File Access</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/visual-basic-local-file-access/327889</link>
    <description>Im not sure what im trying to say but pretty much here is an explanation. My Programming 2 teacher will allow us to listen to music and play games in class if we make a program that can listen to music and play games. Well obviously the easiest way for me to go about doing this is using the Windows Media Player Active X Control and Shockwave Active X Control in VB Express 2008. Now for the Shockwave control I have save the .swf file and I need to link to this. So I have to put it somewhere in the project folder so when I take the program to school the program will still be able to access the file. Im not sure how to say what I mean but basically it is this. There is a movie file which has to have a file path. What I have now is C:/User/Matthew/My Documents/Visual Studio/Projects/Media Player/game.swf. Obviously when I go to another computer that will not work. What I need is something like /bin/game.swf so when I switch computers I will be able to access the file by putting it where the program is. If that doesn&#39;t make any sense tell me because I&#39;m not really good at explaning things.</description>

              <p>True I was thinking the same thing. Also, I just noticed I added this to the wrong section. I was instead thinking of making a folder in which I would put all my Flash Games. Then on program startup the program would look through the folder for SWF files and list them under menu. So when I clock Menu it would list SWF Games. Then I click one of the file names and it opens that game in a new window. (That might not make any sense ethier). I would have to show what I mean by making the program.</p>
