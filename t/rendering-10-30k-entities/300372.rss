    <description>Lets say i have 10-30k entities to render(client), all had to be rendered then stored for further use(aside from the static game objects), like players and npcs
would be better to use queue, set, or a object array?</description>

<p>Why go backwards? because you only have to access players.length once…[/quote]</p>
<p>I would like to address this once quickly.  There is one thing you have to learn in computer science, the people who write compilers for a living are far smarter than you have ever thought about being.  It is a bad (and wrong) assumption that you are smarter than the compiler, you are not, this code being a case in point.</p>
<p>It is NOT faster to ‘go backwards because you only access players.length once’, because the compiler (again, way smarter than you) caches what players.length returns (it knows it is static and doesn’t change, so it only calls it once) and therefore calls it only once.</p>
<p>If you really want to optimize your code and save 5ms over 100,000 iterations, when you use n++ like that it is slower than ++n because n++ has to copy the value to a new register, use the old register for the return value, increment the new one, and then update any pointers.  Where as ++n just increments the value in place.  However, this is a case in which the compiler will probably optimize this for you again.</p>

<p>Use and presence are different concepts. I doubt you use every single Java class in the Java standard library on every project and yet they are there. And unless the JVM is poorly designed their presence should only have a negligible hard disk memory cost but no performance cost.</p>

<p>Not sure who you are replying to as I don’t think anybody made any emphasis on accessor methods or suggested any particularly stupid solution, but assuming you are using that loop to look for a requested id, as you seem to be doing, it is not a good approach from an algorithmic perspective.</p>
<p>A brute force algorithm such as that is O(n) and in the case of the 30000 entities would need to perform by average 15000 operations before it finds the right player. Also, that approach assumes IDs are perfectly sequential at any given moment of time, which is often incovenient.</p>
<p>On the other side, a binary tree (O(logn)) would take by average 15 operations (versus 15000) to find the player.</p>
<p>A hash map (O(1)) would take by average a single operation to find it.</p>
<p>Note that this would also apply for spatial queries. Obtaining players-in-range lists for every player through a brute force algorithm would be O(n^2) whereas with an structure such as a quadtree it would be O(n logn).</p>
<p>For 30000 entities, this is 900,000,000 operations versus 446,181.</p>

              <p>It depends on your specific needs. However, generally you will want to store references to the entities on a hash map, sorted by their ID, so that ID queries can be done efficiently and with O(1) complexity. As frank said, you will also want to use some sort of scene graph. There are several alternatives, and depending on the game and other factors some may be more efficient than others. Some popular ones are: BSP trees, quadtrees, kd-trees, octrees, spheretrees, speedtrees. Most trees will allow logarithmic spatial queries in the average case ( O(log(n)) ). Depending again on the circumstances, sometimes two different structures are used, one optimized for static objects and another for dynamic objects (For example, a PR-tree for static and a point auto-balanced quadtree for dynamic).</p>

              <p>my post was not referring to how the entities are drawn in his game, it was referring to:[quote=“light232, post:7, topic:300372”]edit:<br>
i see that the rs client(317) uses 2 arrays, one to hold the players and another to hold the indicies(so thats why the index cannot be 0), and same goes for npcs one array to hold the npc object and another to hold thier indicies</p>
<p>well alright thanks[/quote]</p>

              <p>depending on how you handle player specification in your packets (whether per id, name, etc), you should simply set up a map and access specific players through map.get()</p>
<p>i suppose its more efficient then something like:</p>
<p><code>
Player getPlayerById(int id) {
    for (int i : playerIndices) {
        if (player[i].getId() == id) {
            return player[i];
        }
    }
}</code></p>
