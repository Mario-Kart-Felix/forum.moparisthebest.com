    <title>Looking to Build</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-build/340039</link>
    <description>Ok so in about 2 months time I&#39;m going to build my first desktop. Since it&#39;s my first time, I need your help.

As far as specs go, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve planned for so far:

Criticism please. 

Since I will be in Australia, I will be using www.centrecom.com.au


Questions:

1) Are these all the parts I will need? Do I need to buy anything else? Don&#39;t I need other stuff like thermal paste or cooling systems etc.
2) Is it a good idea to build this, even though I&#39;ve never built before?

              <p>Either way, neither centrecom nor pccasegear seem to have any cheap 650w psus’. Looks like I’ll be sticking to the antec true power 650w. I’m also going for the Cooler Master RC-690 - Black ATX Tower Case as mwiebelhaus suggested.</p>

              <p>I would suggesting buying a good surge protector if you do end up deciding on buying a cheap PSU however I totally agree with Thug-Life that you should invest in a quality one.<br>
As well as upgrading, think about how much money you could loose if there’s a power surge and your cheap off-market PSU fries your motherboard, CPU and memory and possibly some other components.</p>

<p>For me, i won’t build a computer without a good quality, well known PSU. Its up to you, there isn’t anything definite about it - but i’d rather be safe and have a quality PSU with a great warranty in a computer with such expensive components.</p>

<p>I might as well stick with a 650W. But I think it’s better if I use a cheaper brand instead of Antec. There’s no risk in using cheaper brands right?</p>

I was initially planning to use pccasegear but I found www.centrecom.com.au to be cheaper in almost everything. It’s also close enough so that I can drive there so I don’t have to pay for delivery.</p>

<p>Does it have enough connectors?<br>
M/B 20+4 Pin x 1<br>

PCI-E 6 Pin x 1<br>

No, you’ll want two PCI-e 6 pins for that card, it’s required iirc and a molex/peripheral-&gt;pcie plug wont do.[/quote]<br>
sure it will do, i’m currently using 4x molex to 2x pci-e 6pin to power my GTX260 since my shit psu don’t have any 6 pin coords.</p>
<p>Radeon with the vid card is usually 2x connectors (2x molex &gt; 1x pci-e 6pin) so your fine there.</p>

<p>^ cheaper, has 24" HD monitor and a modular power supply.</p>
<p>like i said, if you can scrape up another 50-100$ get a better case.</p>
<p>that power supply is great value @ 99$, check out the reviews, people can squeeze out over 730w from the 550w PSU (huntkey claim it can do 600w easy), it’s modular and it’s cables are long and short.</p>

<li>Are these all the parts I will need? Do I need to buy anything else? Don’t I need other stuff like thermal paste or cooling systems etc.</li>
