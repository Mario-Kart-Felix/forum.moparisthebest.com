    <title>Transfering points trough command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/transfering-points-trough-command/373383</link>
    <description>I want a command were you can transfer your clan war points to someone :|
this is the command i got so far;
[code]if(command.startsWith(&quot;transfer&quot;)) {
String text = command.substring(9);
try {
int p = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(name);
client c = (client) server.playerHandler.players[p];
clanWarpts -= text.substring;
c.clanWarpts += text.substring;
sM(&quot;You gave &quot;+c.playerName+&quot; &quot;+text.substring+&quot; clan war pts!&quot;);
c.sM(playerName + &quot; gave you &quot;+text.substring+&quot; clan war pts!&quot;);
yell(plarName + &quot; just gave &quot;+text.substring+&quot; clan war pts to &quot;+c.playerName+&quot;!&quot;);
} catch (Exception e) {
sM(name + &quot; either isn&#39;t online or doesn&#39;t exist&quot;);
}
}[/code]

appearently, it sucks and doesn&#39;t work, it gives me 8 errors in the compiler, and even if i fixed the errors it wouldn&#39;t work.
I&#39;m using delta :rolleyes:</description>
