    <title>Cheat client [base][unstable][unfinished]</title>

    <description>Wow like the fifth time i tried posting this ~_~&#39; 

Client.java written by me 100%
Cryption.java-stolen from any server source
frame.java written 100% by me also.
Listener(part of frame) is also by me.

If you continue this project don&#39;t forget the credits. it is really small and simple. 
It needs to have inputs implemented still. i Have outputs working just fine(though not all packets are supported yet)

I have finished the project but i am not posting it due to its wide variety of uses. It would destroy private servers as we know them, it has the capability to crash(not null) most servers(not all, because of a reason that i will not say, so all of them can&#39;t fix :)) can kill all npc&#39;s rapidly :D (funny when they tell u the drops of people and your getting 40/second) and much much more. I might make a vid of my bot in action but it wouldn&#39;t be anything special. It lags my computer the way it is because it mass loops till log on lol. I could fix it, but why if i am only one who uses it.

i regret posting the original due to the fact that i believe it has been turned into an outrageous spammer and it takes down all of my favourite servers lol.</description>
