    <title>[Guide] Make Your Own Hashish</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/guide-make-your-own-hashish/43728</link>
    <description>Do you smoke marijuana, but crave a deeper cannabis experience? Too lazy to cook brownies? Congratulations, clicking on this topic is your first step in the long process of getting even more fucked up than you already are. It will teach you how to make hand-rubbed hashish, or charras (originally created in Nepal thousands of years ago). This is a very rudimentary and age-old method of making hash...It&#39;s not the most efficient way to make it, but it will get you damn fucked up.

Here is a picture of the finished product, surrounded by crushed marijuana powder (called keif).

First, acquire some marijuana. Buy it, grow it, please don&#39;t steal it, just get your hands on some dub. Preferrably at least half an ounce, but any amount over a gram will do. You need relatively dry nug, the more kind (that means less seeds and stems, you weedtard) it is, the better.

Second, select the most THC rich buds you can find and seperate them from the rest of the pot. Remove any stems or seeds from these nugs. Leaves are OK as they are easily crushed as long as your bud isn&#39;t very very moist. But how do I know which buds are the most THC rich, Uncle Pault? You ask. Well, Jimmy, the most &quot;Crystally&quot; (covered in resin glands, or trichiomes) nuggets, which have the least amount of excess plant matter (ie stems leaves and seeds) are the best nugs.

Third, crush up the nuggets with your hands, over a white piece of paper, untill all you have is powder. Now you should also have powder all over your hands. DON&#39;T PANIC. Instead hold your hands flat together, as if you have just finished clapping, and press hard. Now very slowly rub your hands back and forth, pushing them together hard the whole time. Eventually, depending on how hard your hands are pressed together, the powder will start to form into small (or, if you are good, largish) little rolls of black compressed material. Every few minutes rub your hands off above the paper. After a while, your hands will be clean, and you will have a piece of paper covered in a mixture of weed-powder and the little black things you have smooshed into existence. In a varation on step three, you can sieve out your kief to make sure you only have the finest and best marijuana particles.

Fourth, you should use a magic or baseball card (magic cards make your hashish magical!) to push all your material into a small pile. Push this pile onto the surface of your magic card, then carefully dup it into your hands. Now push all of this together and repeat step three with all of the material. You may need to repeat this several times to get all of the powder compressed together, and you will probably tire your hands out. But finally you will end up with a pile of the dark, resinous little rolls of marijuana powder, highly compressed. 

Finally, place the pile into a small folded piece of paper, so it&#39;s enclosed completely and can&#39;t get out. Then put this in a vice/compress it between your hands extremely hard for as long as you want. The longer it is compressed in this way, the better and more flavorful your hashish. 


Tips:

~Make sure your hands are a good moistness when you roll. Hands that are too dry will make it difficult to roll the hash, and hands that are too wet will also make it difficult. If you wash your hands and dry them before starting, they will be fine.

~You can bake your hash, add some water to it, flavor it by burning incese underneath it, or do whatever you want (within reason) during/after you compress it. Adding some water to the outside of the piece of paper the hashish is in and then baking it on a low heat for a long time in an oven, then compressing it, then repeating these steps over and over adds a great deal of flavor to the hashish.</description>

<p>~Make sure your hands are a good moistness when you roll. Hands that are too dry will make it difficult to roll the hash, and hands that are too wet will also make it difficult. If you wash your hands and dry them before starting, they will be fine.</p>
<p>~You can bake your hash, add some water to it, flavor it by burning incese underneath it, or do whatever you want (within reason) during/after you compress it. Adding some water to the outside of the piece of paper the hashish is in and then baking it on a low heat for a long time in an oven, then compressing it, then repeating these steps over and over adds a great deal of flavor to the hashish.</p>
