    <description>[font=times new roman][size=4]Ok people, I&#39;m having trouble making up my mind.


Some guy from my class, pretty big build, is going to fight me. Why? Because he&#39;s the so called cool guy that tries to intimidate me and his expectations are that I say, oh sorry, I should have never told you to go fuck yourself. For example he tells me to look in front of me in the classroom, I tell him, you&#39;re not special nor cool so go fuck yourself. He says he&#39;s going to beat me up, I say if you&#39;re a man do it now.


After some more of those, she finally got mad and faced me on the playground, he put his head close to mine, in a position where I could break his jaw easily, and said some stuff I don&#39;t remember. All I do remember is that he was going to beat me up after school.


But he had detention today, so he was not there. I made some other friends on school, that are more bad-ass than that guy, and they went and told his friends today after school that they will kill him if he tries to fight me.


Altough not nessecary, it was nice to know I got some folks on my side. But this is something I want to handle on my own.
If he&#39;s going to beat me up, then it&#39;s going to be on monday.


Now here&#39;s the catch, last year, another big guy from my class wanted to fight me, but that time I did fight the guy.
I broke his jaw, bruised his stomach, and did some other things to the guy. His parents took him to the hospital, and the hospital called the police resulting in me having to write a statement and signing it. And they gave me a contract that I&#39;m not allowed to hurt someone else anymore.


I think I can handle the guy, sure he&#39;s big and has some muscle, but I&#39;m a thaiboxer and I have much more speed and technique than he will ever have.


I don&#39;t ever like to back down, but I don&#39;t think the fight will be worth the trouble.


What would you do in my place knowing you had the power to defeat the guy, although not 100% sure, knowing you had the friends on school and had Armenian brothers from other mothers to beat himand his friends up and knowing that you had a contract with the police.


I honestly don&#39;t know.[/size][/font]</description>

<p>Makes no sense tbh… If you can break his jaw, then why are you afraid of him beating you up, and need protection?</p>
