    <title>Trading without enough space, items gone</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trading-without-enough-space-items-gone/240712</link>
    <description>When you make a trade, and one of the players doesn&#39;t have enough inventory space - rather than the trade being automatically canceled the trade continues but the items that they don&#39;t have space for are lost - not dropped on the ground or returned to anyone&#39;s inventory. Any help would be appreciated.</description>
