    <description>Hey guys

well there is this game or application on facebook known as warbook

its a rpg click based game where you attack other players and stuff like that.
the thing is that ANY script that is helpful for that game would be nice.

things that are helpful (*in order or priority )for warbook:
*multiple acount logging in which buys cheap soldiers to attack your OTher acounts to make it full alert
*attacker of weaker kingdoms with calculation if you can
* land buyer or defender to defend lands
* ANY other helpful script

thanks guys :)
