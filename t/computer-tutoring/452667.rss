    <title>Computer tutoring</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/computer-tutoring/452667</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been thinking about trying to run a computer tutoring service to make some money. I would teach people in my local area, who want to learn how to use a computer and make the most of it. I live in Leicester, UK, so there are a lot of older generation indians and muslims here who, from speaking to, seemed interested in the idea of non-formal tutoring, teaching them how to use a computer to perform simple tasks like setting up an e-mail account, using MS Office programs, music, videos, images, and pretty much most things a computer literate person would be able to perform. 

Has anyone done anything like this before? Any advice on things to think about before I start my prep and trying to make customers. 

Obviously, I need to make a plan of what I&#39;m going to teach and how I&#39;m going to teach it. I also want to be able to give any customer a quick-start/reference guide, that I will create.

Thoughts?</description>

              <p>I’ve done some of this, although mostly for free - be ready for frustration, learn to handle it and not take it out on the tutee. One of the most important things I found was that sticking to strict lesson plan is often a bit hard… keep it detailed but open ended, as some people may need more help understanding certain concepts than others, while others may zip through your material and leave you blank faced. It’s often a good idea to find ways to relate and interconnect things, e.g. relate the concept of something like sending data to a web page to talking and exchanging proof of identification/forms (shitty example). Also, from experience working in customer service and sales, you need to be ready to roll with multiple scenarios. It doesn’t sound like your audience would be the kind of person to eat you alive, but be prepared for setbacks/insults/frustrations/shocks/etc.</p>

<p>Don’t come around here much anymore, just happen to come across this thread and saw my name lol! Here was the thread you are talking about! Not much information just me talking about how one of my clients gave me a bunch of free stuff from their office building.</p>

<p>So yeah I ended up doing that for 6 months on and off and made some decent money. It was fun at first and then got boring, I stopped and got a really good job at a very large company after my freshman year of college. Its consistent, I am basically guaranteed a job after college (they hate investing and training interns and then losing them to other companies), the internship is as a Network Systems Engineer.</p>
<p>Here is a couple things:</p>
<p>Some clients will give you “broken” computers…they aren’t usually broken just reformat them and resale them for some extra cash, $40 for a decent pentium 4 computer will go quick, don’t expect this to happen often though, just when you get lucky.</p>
<p>One client gave me a “broken” Xerox laser printer I sold for $250 after I fixed it for nothing, a cannon camera + lens that I sold for $500, and miscellaneous other stuff I sold for about $100.</p>
<p>The guy I sold the printer too still calls me for ink which I can get on ebay for cheap and then sell him it to him for double the price (he is still getting a really good deal, from xerox they are $200)</p>
<p>Even after I stopped my “business” I get 1 or 2 previous customers that will call me every month and I can make an extra $50 here and there.</p>
<p>Don’t expect consistent work unless you plan on actually getting into this sort of thing and build a large customer base. One week you may get 7 calls and the next week you may get 1 call.</p>
<p>I had a really nice website and I paid $60 for a box of really nice business cards I designed, I still have half the box that I can’t use now ha. This will help you appear professional and make your “business” look larger than it really is.</p>
