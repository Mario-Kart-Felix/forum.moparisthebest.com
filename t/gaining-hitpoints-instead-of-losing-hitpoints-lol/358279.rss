    <title>Gaining hitpoints instead of losing hitpoints lol</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gaining-hitpoints-instead-of-losing-hitpoints-lol/358279</link>
    <description>i maxed out bronze platelegs, platebody, kiteshield, full helm, and longsword with 2,000,000,000 in every stat for each. then when i attack another player, he gains hitpoints? why is that? lol. he should die in one hit in my case. he had over 600,000,000 hitpoints. and now i just got banned by my own server lol..this is annoying :P

EDIT - CLOSED for some reason it was a one time only bug. i wasnt really banned and i just kill in one hit. that was weird.</description>
