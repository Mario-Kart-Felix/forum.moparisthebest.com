    <title>Content Developer Needed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/content-developer-needed/393344</link>
    <description>Didn&#39;t know if this is the wrong section, if so please move.

To explain what I need, and why I need:
Currently two of my friends and I are developing a server with the newer protocol revision of 614. Both of them have no experience in programming and run the forums &amp; server while I make it. Now with the time consumption of college, work, personal life, and this. I find that I do not have enough time to develop all that needs to be finished.
That&#39;s where &#39;you&#39; come into play. I am looking for someone that knows how to program with java. I need to have someone that gets along with people, is willing to take criticism on improvements, willing to put in time to contribute, and knows what they are doing. Understand that you [b]have to know how to program[/b], and can do it intermediately well.

Examples of things you would be required to do:
- Skills
- Combat related things (specials, potions, fixes, improvements, etc)
- Minigames (I can help with this, but with more people it&#39;s easier to develop faster)
- Custom/Random material
- Other. 

Examples of things done recently:
Fishing for 614/634:

(Emote is wrong, fixed since picture was taken)
Bone burying, w/ newer items as proof of loading higher cache:

Please contact me on msn if interested: slayer.love@hotmail.com

You will be required to show your abilities, so come prepared.</description>

</aside>
<p>You don’t get paid for developing, you only get a share of donations. As my server currently has $65 in donations from the first week. But as I said, you won’t get paid. And money shouldn’t be your motivation. I don’t like money hungry people.</p>
