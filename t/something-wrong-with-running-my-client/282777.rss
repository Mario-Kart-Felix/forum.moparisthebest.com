    <title>Something wrong with running my client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/something-wrong-with-running-my-client/282777</link>
    <description>Okay I&#39;ve been trying to get an answer all day I&#39;ve searched for 3 days straight now and I&#39;ve downloaded many versions of java and put them in the right folders for some reason I cant get my clients to run they just open then close really fast. So if someone can help me for once please direct me straight to the right java file I need to download or tell me what to do because everything I&#39;ve tried has been a complete failure.</description>
