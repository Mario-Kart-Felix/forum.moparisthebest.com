Tell us a bit about yourself. What hobbies, activities, sports, etc. do you like to take part in?</p>
<ul>
<li>A bit about me. I’m currently doing computer science at the moment. I reached a point with my involvement in the community where I felt my skills were lacking and it’s something I always wanted to improve. There’s a lot of people here who are absolutely fantastic and it’s a shame that contributions have dropped. As for hobbies… I rarely get any time these days! I’m always juggling the girlfriend with uni. I think WoW is the only ‘hobby’ I have the time to maintain.</li>
</ul>
<p>You say you’re currently doing computer science. how long have you been involved in it, what do you like/dislike? what languages are you proficient in?</p>
<ul>
<li>Not long actually. I’ve dabbled here and there with java for a long time but compared to some of the other members, I’ll be the first to admit that I’m not the greatest. Which is odd considering how I frequently enjoy playing the egotistical Nazi lord on the forums.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you do any work outside of uni? Is it enjoyable for you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Depends what sort of work you’re talking about. If you’re talking about a part time job, then no. I was lucky enough to be on six figures before starting uni as a mature age student so I have a lot of savings to keep me going. If you’re talking about private projects then yeah, I’m doing a little with a few classmates. We’re working on a great app idea at the moment and on the side, I fiddle around with WoW addons. Sounds fairly typical, eh? I no longer touch anything related to runescape because it’s just dull to me.</li>
</ul>
<p>You say that you’ve been around the “scene” for quite a few years now. Mind giving us a summary of what you’ve seen happen over the years that’s notable?</p>
<ul>
<li>What has been most interesting over the past few years is how the member base has split into little groups. I’ve always seen the scene split into two, with Sythe/RuneCMS on one side and Kaits/Mopar on the other. Before that, things were a little bit more unified, I felt. Now we see even smaller communities split off as private servers have taken over the whole bot development scene. Over time, I’ve seen this side of the divide become more about general discussion and people returning just because it’s familiar. It’s going to be interesting to see where we are in another few years. Private servers were the worst thing to happen to this scene. We’ve had 9999 more 14 year olds and our community is starting to lack a central focus. It’s something that we have to fix soon before it becomes too late. I’ve also seen changes in levels of contribution, attitudes of certain members and the transfer of member base from one community to the other as one fades off. The fix? Perhaps it’s too late. We should have done more with what we had at the time. We had all the ‘groundbreaking’ flashy toys at the start. We took everything for granted and became lazy. I think it’s a little too late though.  Usually there’s great developers working on private projects. These ideas trickle out into the public who write shitty copies and then progress is slowly made. This model doesn’t work when those core developers who done the original work aren’t there anymore. eg, regex, winterlove and semaphore</li>
</ul>
<p>From what I’ve gathered from my short time here, you used to be a staff member here. What was it like moderating then?</p>
<ul>
<li>I used to enjoy the politics of the position. Though it’s all rather meaningless, it fed into my ego. It was a fun little character I like to play around the boards. I used to have the Java Cup as well as the moderator position. I believe Mopar and I even got along! Moderating used to be full on. This was back when everything was really busy and new members were flooding in. There was a lot of rubbish to clear up but in the background, we still had some nice projects going on. It was just more full on. We had a lot of lazy moderators back then as well so the workload wasn’t exactly shared. It’s strange to see people in global moderator or admin positions now, when I was the one giving them infractions just a few years earlier.</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s really stuck out to you over the years? What have you learned over time, and what would you hope to pass down to newcomers if given the chance?</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a fair few nice memories! I really do love this scene. it has it’s flaws and needs a lot of improvement but I have a soft spot for it all. So what sticks out? Trolling everyone into thinking Mopar was dead; one of my best threads yet, back at kaits, jme was working on a little rpg in blitz3d; i remember looking forward to that, and there used to be this member called p00 flake but at kaits who was a lot younger than everyone else but was wonderful to laugh at. Oh, and getting newswriter at kaitnieks! i know it’s fairly lame but i did have a lot of respect for that fellow. There has been so many great moments that would take me days to write out. We do have our great moments. I do regret the arguments that I’ve had with Mopar though. I have nothing against the guy and I enjoyed our chats a while ago. Some advice for new comers…Be curious. Look up to people. Find a mentor. Really, just enjoy the politics and learn as much as you can. Don’t expect spoonfeeding and jump into any task you want. Have tough skin as well. We can be brutal here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Earlier back, you mentioned changes that you wish could’ve been taken advantage of when we had the chance. What changes do you think should’ve been made? more specifically, what changes do you think could be made to the Mopar forums?</p>
<ul>
<li>We should have applied more focus to the bot development side. We had a good thing going back then and we dropped the ball a little. Allowing everyone to create their own private server was a mistake too. That was bound to steal some members eventually. What changes could be made now? I mentioned in a suggestion thread a while back that we need to become the central hub again. Pick the best from each community and offer them a position (not moderating) here where they can work on a project with the other decent developers; have a ‘crew’ I guess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where do you see moparscape/moparisthebest (irc and forums) a few years from now?</p>
<ul>
<li>This one is a hard one. I think we will eventually shut our doors. It’s only a matter of time really. Perhaps Mopar will get tired of being the host for the community or interest in the game will decline even more. The IRC members will run off somewhere else. Whether or not a new community is made by one of us… can’t say. That’s generally how it has been; one community dies -&gt; staff member creates a new one.</li>
</ul>
<p>What has made you stick around for all these years? is there anyone in particular that you find to be motivation that keeps drawing you back?</p>
<ul>
<li>My reasons have changed over the years. At the start it was more curiosity. All these incredibly smart people were doing all these amazing things and I had no idea how they did it. So I wanted to learn. Then I enjoyed the politics of it all. Soon I outgrew that. I’ve taken a few year breaks here and there. What keeps me coming back though is how familiar this all seems. The members sometimes change but those key personalities get replaced. So after years and years of being here, it all starts to feel a little like a family. We all spend so much time here. We have our history, stories that we share and a terrible but amusing culture. Never running out of things to say after, ‘remember that time…’</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell us a bit about kaitnieks. What was it like when everything was still unexplored?</p>
<ul>
<li>It was a really wonderful place. This was back when the core contributors were all friendly. The most unapproachable people here, were the most helpful members back then. There was a huge focus on SCAR scripting and everyone seemed to give it a try. There were a lot of great tutorials. There was also the client hacking side of it. I’ll never forget running around as a magic tree. Perhaps it was because I was younger and it was all new.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any last words you’d like to put in to close the interview?</p>
<ul>
<li>I know this interview came off a bit dull and it was probably expected that I would rant on about the old days or how superior I am to everyone else. Truth be told, I’m probably still stuck in the past a little but the past is what I grew up with. The egotistical act around the boards is just a game I play, like everyone else playing their own little roles. Probably a lot of members that I’ve insulted over the years are reading this, but it’s all lighthearted fun. You need the tough skin to survive here. Thanks to everyone for making it a pleasure to remain here. Also, this Mopar Monthly is a great idea. Everyone should try contributing. Also a thanks to all the great people who have helped me out over the years. Semaphore and all of them.[/code]</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll work on making it look nice and format it sometime tomorrow, I just wanted to have this in the section for now.</p>
