    <title>Newb Question -- PLEASE ANSWER</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/newb-question-please-answer/192974</link>
    <description>Okay, so here&#39;s my dilemma:
I&#39;m trying to make a lottery, but my initial thought is: How do I do this? &#39;int lotteryTime = 500;&#39; will just make a private variable for that one character.

So my question is, how do I make it so that a variable works across the server, for all people?

Like, if one variable is 458, then it is 458 for every other person on the server.

Thanks in advance,
Zach
