    <description>Dual Core Intel® Xeon® E3120, 3.16GHz, 6MB Cache, 1333MHz FSB
Dual Core Intel® Xeon® L3110, 3.0GHz, 6MB Cache, 1333MHz FSB, 40W TDP

Which is better, and why?

Also, how much better is the Xeon than family than the Pentium family? (Dual Core Intel® Pentium® E5400, 2.7GHz, 3MB Cache, 800MHz FSB)</description>

<p>if youre just running a small-moderately sized lamp server then i wouldnt worry about it, if theres a big price difference youre almost certainly fine with the pentium system.</p>
<p>if you already know what youre going to run on it you could probably make a good guess where the bottleneck is going to be anyway, and it might not even be cpu</p>

<p>i’m pretty sure i was correct with the comparison, but yeah that does make sense i guess. heat and power consumption are quite important factors for me.</p>
<p>i don’t really know much about servers - tbh i thought desktop computers and servers were essentially the same thing, only without a monitor and designed to run better over long periods of time. clearly i was wrong <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>what are you doing on the server?</p>
<p>edit: i assume in the previous post you meant “than the e3120” - yes, they are more expensive. like i said they have a (quite a bit) smaller TDP for only a slight drop in processing power. if you’re building say, a 1u/2u server like many people buying them will be, its probably worth the price to you to have less heat to deal with, not to mention power consumption if youre buying en masse.</p>
<p>people building servers often have more important considerations than clock speed <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Yeah I was looking at servers on the dell website. The Pentium was the cheapest, then the Xeons cost around £100 more. But for some reason the L3110 cost about £20 more than the L3120, so I was wondering if there is a magical hidden advantage to having a processor with a 0.16GHz slower clock speed.</p>
<p>Would paying the extra £100 for the Xeon processor be well worth it for a server then? I was only planning on getting like 2GB of RAM, then upgrading when I need more.</p>

              <p>of the two you posted, the E3120 is very slightly “better” but theres not much in it and it runs quite a bit hotter and is power hungrier</p>
<p>the xeon family and pentium family are two completely different lines, its not really possible to give a list of differences or comparisons for the lines as a whole. generally xeons are used in servers, though high end workstations that are likely to be running apps that are well optimised for parallel processing also love them (think video editing, digital audio). the mac pros are xeon based, for example.</p>
<p>one big difference is that the xeon family support multi-cpu environments (usually), except you picked 2 from the series that doesn’t <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
they also tend to be beefier cpus all round rather than focusing on clock speed, more cache faster bus etc</p>
<p>beware that you wont be able to drop them into a pentium specced system though, even the LGA755 ones use different ram</p>
