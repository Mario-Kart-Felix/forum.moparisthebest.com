    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-on-a-simplish-code-please/112947</link>
    <description>Right, i may sound stupid here but hey, i did coding a while back, few years maybe... and i need a code that when i type ::ko (nick) it will hit a 200 on them. also i need it for owner only

And some of you may have been to a server with skillcapes? well, has anyone tried the defence cape? when you do the skill, a big yellow thing comes over u with a bit of red? lol.. i want it do that emote/gfx idk, hitting the 200.
