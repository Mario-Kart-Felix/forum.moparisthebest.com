    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/random-access-to-my-computer-from-foreign-countries/282994</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got a problem;

Okay, I recently encountered a problem.
I just finished rebooting; And right after all my programs started, This happened:
[IMG]http://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x34/luke_livez/ZA.jpg[/img]
I&#39;ve went through count-less IP&#39;s looking them up.
And They are all foregin countries.
Argentina, Mexico, Spain, Italy..
I haven&#39;t took a picture but last time I rebooted I got well over a thousand Messages.
Do you think some newfag gave my IP to a bunch of foreign gayfags?
189.240.55.179 ^ = Mexico.
Anyway,
If anyone has an answer. Please; Post.

Thanks,
Lewk.</description>
