    <title>[PI] Make Client Members Only</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-make-client-members-only/393766</link>
    <description>I currently have a PI server. I have to have two clients because I do not know anyone good enough with clients to enable non-members to see member&#39;s items as &quot;members objects&quot; and members to see the actual name of the item into one client (If you can tell me that&#39;d be more appreciated).

Anyways one client is for F2P and the other for P2P. I need to know a way to make it so only actual members can log into the P2P client otherwise people who haven&#39;t bought membership can just log into the P2P client and play as a member. All help is appreciated. thanks.

The code in the Client&#39;s ItemDef.java:

[CODE]			itemDef.toNote();
		if(!isMembers &amp;&amp; itemDef.membersObject) {
			itemDef.name = &quot;Members Object&quot;;
			itemDef.description = &quot;Login to a members&#39; server to use this object.&quot;.getBytes();
			itemDef.groundActions = null;
			itemDef.actions = null;
			itemDef.team = 0;
		}
[/CODE]
Basically &quot;If(!isMembers&quot; is saying if the player is a not a member then a P2P items will be displayed as &quot;Member&#39;s Objects&quot; and the examine info will change also. The only thing problem is that the client isn&#39;t recognizing whether or not a player is member or not. I looked it up and supposedly the server isn&#39;t sending a packet correctly or not at all causing the client not to, in simple terms, use these lines of code. 

If i change the code above to:

[CODE]			itemDef.toNote();
		if(isMembers &amp;&amp; itemDef.membersObject) {           &lt;------------------remove the &quot;!&quot; (means if player is member)
			itemDef.name = &quot;Members Object&quot;;
			itemDef.description = &quot;Login to a members&#39; server to use this object.&quot;.getBytes();
			itemDef.groundActions = null;
			itemDef.actions = null;
			itemDef.team = 0;
		}
[/CODE]
If I change the code to this above then, for some reason, all P2P items are displayed how I want them but is displayed for both non-members and members. Makes no sense making it say if the player is a member it will show P2P items as &quot;Member&#39;s Objects.&quot;</description>
