    <description>Very new apprentice if you will right now just starting learning to create my own server learning as I go, 

if class path &lt;blockquote&gt;CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin;%CLASSPATH%;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and path &lt;blockquote&gt;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


what would I switch it too for jdk-8u25 (newest one I downloaded also wondering if this was a correct download) referring to How to Start a Server via [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,342685.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,342685.0.html[/url]

also a link to right java if that wasn&#39;t it would be awesome! or anyway so I could confirm


think I figured it out so if I follow this path &gt; C:\Program Files\Java\ , 2 folders pop up which will be the name/version of my jdk if I have it installed both my folders came up just have &quot;Jdk7&quot; solved correct ? 

&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin\javac.exe&quot; -classpath  (is the compilers original code)
So I tested it in compiler in random source and it wont work what would I edit for the compiler</description>

              <p>So. If you look at your classpath, you’d notice it’s just a filepath to where the jdk bin is.<br>
To change it to jdk8 u 25, you’d change the 1.6.0_11 to 1.8.0_25 (You can also see this in your folder where you installed the jdk).<br>
Same goes for path…</p>
<p>“The right java” would vary based on what you’re doing. Typically, the latest release will be fine. However, Java 1.8 has changed some security settings, making it <span class="bbcode-i">almost</span> impossible for self-signed applets to be used in web browsers. A.K.A, your webclient you’d use. most people just opt to compile the client on 1.7, which still allows self-signed applets (Without using the whitelist).<br>
You can have Java 1.8 and compile to 1.7 by using the -target option.<br>
See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html#options" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this link</a> for more.</p>
<p>As for the compilers “original” code. that’s just regular compiler code.<br>
They used the directory for the java compiler because they probably didn’t have environmental variables set. So, since you do, you can replace the quotes and what’s in them with “javac”. This will still target the java compiler. “java” will run a java application and “javaw” is the exact same, but there will be no associated command window.</p>
<p>If you want more information on your issue, please post the actual error you see in the compiler, it will help us greatly in identifying your issue.</p>
