    <title>[PI] Woodcutting issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-woodcutting-issue/381511</link>
    <description>I am currently using an Impact 2.0 source, and I&#39;m pretty sure that Impact 2.0 is PI based since they are both nearly identical.
I have noticed that woodcutting has a slight issue, some trees may take several clicks to cut. i.e, Oak rarely ever cuts when clicked, it could take ALOT of clicks for the cutting to register, and there is a possibility that there will be no animation along with a possibility that there will be.
I have google searched this issue and have run into some &#39;improved woodcutting&#39; topics, but they all do not fit the classes written with this source.</description>
