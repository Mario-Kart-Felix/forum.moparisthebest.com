    <description>Server Success:

By: Ryan0

	Runescape players play for a short variety of reasons.  Some enjoy all aspects while others look solely for specific features regarding their playstyle.  With so much freedom in a game like this, there are many variables to consider.  All of which play a role in dictating your server&#39;s success.  Although individually burdensome, the stress can be managed by assigning each to 4 basic categories and subcategories.  These will help you efficiently manage your server without becoming lost in a sea of &quot;to-do&#39;s,&quot; as well as more easily identify simple improvements and additions.

1. Playability  -  Playability refers to the experience a player encounters when striving to reach any goal for their character.  This applies to leveling, monster killing, skilling, minigames etc. This experience requires 3 main attributes in order to be &quot;good.&quot; It must be...

	A. Challenging - If an experience fails to create a challenge for the player, it will have a negative impact on their opinion of your server. Players want to feel proud and as if they have truly accomplished something when they complete their goal.  Don&#39;t make it too easy.

	B. Rewarding - If a player strives to accomplish something and the payout feels unworth the time and effort they put forward, it will be a negative experience.  Always be sure to include not only an acceptable reward for the required effort but a unique one as well.  For example a mini-game that gives an item that you can not obtain any other way.

	c. Balance - This is simply referring to the first two categories.  It is imperative to balance the two accordingly depending on the reward and time involved. If a game feature follows these basic guidelines, then it will be a successful, integral part of the whole.

2. Economy - Economy is an extremely important part of a successful server.  When a player has strived to amass an impressive bank, it becomes a tool for their instinctive competitive drive.  Showing off what your worth has been a sign of pride in man since his beginning and the same exists within your server.  THERE ARE NO SUBCATS HERE BECAUSE A SUCCESSFUL ECONOMY CREATES ITSELF AND IS SOLELY DICTATED BY THE PLAYABILITY.  ACCEPTABLE REWARDS FOR TIME PUT FORTH.

3. Gambling - This is an easy feature to install and is a main focus of many players when determining which server to play.  Include many opportunites for players to take a chance for big rewards or losses.  Also, gambling is a good way to remove coins from circulation resulting in a more stable economy.

4. PvP - Pvp is another major attractive feature for gamers.  Weapons and armor must be balanced in order to offer a variety of options as well as appeal.  There are many approaches to a unique pvp experience so be creative.

Note-

Server glitches and bugs are common and to be expected in the early stages of server development.  These should be priority for obvious reasons.  Server glitches arise in two forms.  Beneficial and disadvantageous.

Beneficial - Beneficial bugs result in a player obtaining substantial reward for very little effort.  These types of glitches can single handedly destroy your economy and result in server failure.
     Proper action-
          It is imperative that you keep backups of player files at all times in order to address server threatening bugs.  When you receive information of such an occurrence, the proper response is to immediately shut down the server until it has been addressed.  Remember that beneficial errors will always have a negative impact on your server but the effects can be minimized through preventative measures.

disadvantageous - These types of bugs will have a negative impact on players due to unnecessary or unfair loss of items.  While these bugs are not nearly as threatening as beneficial ones, they still effect the morale of your server greatly.
     Proper action-
          These should always be addressed with swift action, even if it requires shutting down for a short time.  If a player has acceptable proof of malfunction, they should be reimbursed for their losses.

Conclusion---

As always when administrating a private server, priority goes to player content.  Listen to your community and react accordingly.  Remember, you are a leader and great leaders do what it takes to make their followers happy.  I hope this helps you in managing your server and good luck!</description>
