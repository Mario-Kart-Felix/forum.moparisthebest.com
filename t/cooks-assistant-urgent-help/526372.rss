    <description>Hello reader, I have recently tried to add the &quot;Cooks assistant&quot; quest to my server from scratch and without guides. Everything is going perfectly, the only issue is that when someone finishes the quest, the server acts as if everyone else finished it too.

[b][u]ALSO THE QUEST STUFF RESTARTS EVERY TIME I RUN THE SERVER AGAIN[/u][/b]

For example.

Mod Docent finished Cooks Assistant.

Mod Docent gets 300 Cooking exp and 1 Quest point.

Mod Docent is not allowed to speak to the cook again (thats how I made my version of the quest)

Player1 logs on and tries to speak to the cook but can&#39;t because Mod Docent has already finished the quest.

=============================

Basically what im asking is how i can make this quest pertain to one player only

I would love anyone who replies with a good explanation of why this is happening and how to fix this.

[b][i][u]THE SOURCE I AM USING IS RUNESOURCE!!!!!!!!!!!![/u][/i][/b]</description>
