(Not inside)[/quote]The pool is from the inside to outside because we had a certain amount of space and the pool sould of been alot bigger so we decied to remove one of the rooms and make the pool inside apart of the house aswell as outside</p>
<p>and the right room has a kind of stairs of some short inside what i will be improving with a model when i implent it into the editor</p>
