    <title>Help running my server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-running-my-server/322668</link>
    <description>My server use to run fine. But i recently had someone come out and fix my wireless internet. When he did that he messed it up somehow now my server runs but no one can connect. I want to be able to fix this soon because I already started losing players. My no-ip is working and the command prompt is open but they get the &quot;Error connecting to server&quot; when they try logging in. I will try to install everything again but if this persist i might need a dedicated host. If you have an idea as to what might have happen please tell me.

Edit: I forgot to mention that I had the Ethernet cord connected to my Motorola Cable Modem. And the technician connected it to from my Linksys Broadband Router to the Modem and I belive back to the Tower.</description>

              <p>When the person changed your wireless he messed up the port forwarding you had done earlier. You need to redo it.</p>
