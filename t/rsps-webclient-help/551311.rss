              <p>well first of all, let me just say this before I even answer your question:<br>
Even if you are able to get a domain which supports jar files and your client is webclient ready, unless you pay a hefty sum, (usually around $100) you will not be able to have a webclient.</p>
<p>This is because of Java’s new security procedures, which they made it so any self-signed application would not be able to run unless it had a Java certificate. Before you could atleast set your java security to medium which would sort the problem but they have since removed the option to do so. Your only way would be to get everyone who plays the webclient to add your webclient to the exceptions list, which is irritating and many people won’t understand how to do so (some even say it doesn’t work for them regardless).</p>
<p>So yeah. You can’t really have a webclient unless you pay serious bux</p>
