    <description>I am trying to load a 2d tile maps without the use of a loading screen currently I am loading 5 maps into memory the starting map and then the 4 surrounding maps. However I am having a slight problem with &quot;corner&quot; maps I made a small picture to help describe the situation

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/GWwgc4a.png[/img]

the red rectangle represents the current view area as you notice I now have a null area of the map due to the bottom right corner not being loaded into memory. 

Currently the current map is only changed when the player completely exits the mapdata and it gets shifted to a neighboring map position depending on which way the character is traveling. I was doing it this way for planning of map specific music.

Would it be in my interest to just load the 4 additional neighboring maps into memory or should I change the current map to a neighboring map when its &gt; 50% traveled?</description>

right now my maps are 50x50 *32x32px so i guess loading the other 4 wouldn’t be a huge problem i just though it was a little wasteful as this situation would only happen if a player is for some reason traveling on corners.<br>
[/quote]So each map takes up 2500 bytes if you only have one byte per tile. That’s practically nothing. If you’re still worried though, think about breaking down maps and making them 25x25. You did say you’re only splitting them up for the music.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to suggest using computer-friendly numbers and not decimal-friendly numbers. For example, have 64x64 or 48x48 maps, not *0 maps. Even if you don’t <span class="bbcode-b">need</span> to, it’s good practice in game development.[/quote]<br>
the maps are slightly bigger as I have layering of tiles however its still not a huge increase because I do not use it for everything. Also I am curious as to the benefit of the computer friendly map sizes? at this moment i am keeping my view port divisible by 32 which is my current standard tile size. I do have support for various sized tiles but have not nor feel i will be using it. Basically I am using TMX map format exported to json <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format</a> example: <a href="http://silabsoft.org/Dargnor/assets/maps/main.json" rel="nofollow noopener">http://silabsoft.org/Dargnor/assets/maps/main.json</a></p>
<p>my current setup is caching the tile sheets so I wouldn’t be reloading those resources repeatedly.</p>

              <p>I think loading all 9 would be advantageous, but you need to consider how big the viewport is, how fast the player can walk, at which point will it load the next regions, etc. Loading time shouldn’t be too high for the most part, so you can probably load regions within a view tiles of the viewport, that way players don’t have some definitive line they can go back and forth on, continuously reloading the regions. Food for thought I suppose.</p>

              <p>You have several options here. I would suggest just loading all 8 surrounding maps into memory because I doubt they’re memory intensive. Unless you actually have corner maps and your maps are set up more like Pokemon maps, you could have a border tile that gets placed where the map ends and no connecting map is being shown. Or you could simply stop the viewport from extending into the neighboring maps. Or you could extend the right map so it’s vertically longer or the bottom map so it’s horizontally longer.</p>

              <p>I am trying to load a 2d tile maps without the use of a loading screen currently I am loading 5 maps into memory the starting map and then the 4 surrounding maps. However I am having a slight problem with “corner” maps I made a small picture to help describe the situation</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GWwgc4a.png" alt width="161" height="81"></p>
<p>the red rectangle represents the current view area as you notice I now have a null area of the map due to the bottom right corner not being loaded into memory.</p>
<p>Currently the current map is only changed when the player completely exits the mapdata and it gets shifted to a neighboring map position depending on which way the character is traveling. I was doing it this way for planning of map specific music.</p>
<p>Would it be in my interest to just load the 4 additional neighboring maps into memory or should I change the current map to a neighboring map when its &gt; 50% traveled?</p>
