    <description>I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of people who join the server either cannot work out how the /login command works, I think they try logging in with their actual minecraft password and then when they realize it doesn&#39;t work they just give up trying.

We need a /register command, that connects to the forums automatically, so people wont need to open up a browser and go through all the registering etc for a server they may not even like.

I know that /login isn&#39;t hard to understand at all but you know what some people are like on the internet.</description>
