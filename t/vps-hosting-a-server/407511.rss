    <title>VPS Hosting a server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vps-hosting-a-server/407511</link>
    <description>Okay, well I&#39;m preparing to buy a VPS from [url=http://vpsland.com]This site[/url] and was wondering what kind of VPS I should get.  My server has around 20 on during the day but it&#39;s picking up.  It&#39;s a DSPK base with things I personally added as well as things I took from other servers such as memleak fixes.  I&#39;m not the best with hosting, I just want to know what kind of VPS you would recommend for such a server.  Also if you have a different host that is better let me know.

Thanks.</description>
