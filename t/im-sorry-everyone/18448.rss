    <title>I&#39;m sorry everyone</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-sorry-everyone/18448</link>
    <description>In light of my short leave and return about a week ago. I feel i have set of a chain reaction. First me, then Mr.Chris, now leader and cowie and a few others.
I feel i have set this off, even though Chris has a very valid reason, i feel i have just pushed these people the extra mile towards leaving.
So i apologise to everyone of the moparisthebest community, if i have lost you any good friends the past week or so.
As i have said before, i&#39;m back for.. well good now. But i&#39;m only going to be putting all my time and effort into Graphics board down at the bottom. :)
Once again sorry.</description>

<p>I have been thinking about leaving for a long time. There isn’t any reason that you should be sorry. It isn’t your fault that people are leaving. The main reason I was deciding to leave was because I have too much stress and things on my mind, and have sleeping problems. For some reason I automatically wake up 3-5 hours after I go to bed and then can’t go back to sleep.</p>
<p>I never get anything done because I always have something else that I have to do first. Example yesterday I had to go play tennis with my dad, and now I have to do so much homework today. I felt like dropping out of school because I stay up doing homework until 12-2 am. I don’t get to spend time with friends or family and get in trouble everyday.</p>
<p>It is good that you’re going to stay and be active on this forum. I’m glad you passed your test. Mr. Chris is staying on this forum too, isn’t he? Well, I will talk to you sometime on msn.</p>
<p>Your friend,<br>
Leader</p>
