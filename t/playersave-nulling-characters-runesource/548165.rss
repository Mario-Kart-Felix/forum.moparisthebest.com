    <title>PlayerSave nulling characters [Runesource]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/playersave-nulling-characters-runesource/548165</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m having an issue. Ever since I&#39;ve added some ints and booleans to my playersave, any time I log out of a freshly made account, the ints and booleans go all weird on the player. 

An example:

[i]New player logs in.[/i]
[i]A variable is naturally set at 0.[/i]
[i]Player logs out.[/i]
[i]Player logs back in.[/i]
[i]The int that WAS 0 becomes 16777215.[/i]
[i]Every int becomes that value and every boolean is randomly set from null, true, or false[/i]

That&#39;s what&#39;s happening for me, can anyone give me some tips? I&#39;ve also been using the 2006Memorys source as my base.</description>

              <p>I’ve fixed it, just took the block of code where I added the ints and booleans above some other ones.</p>
