    <description>hello, i currently have a pi base i recently made it so when you log in the make over mage change appearancee came up.
i wish to make it so this only happens to new players, players which it is there first time login in on there account.
this means that once an account has already been made and has been logged in once the char editor wont come up again. if anyone can help me do this it will make my day. thank you.</description>
