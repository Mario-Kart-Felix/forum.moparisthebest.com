    <description>Okay, I&#39;m having a problem with my Fight Pits. When the timer hits 0, and everyone in the Fight Pits Waiting room, doesn&#39;t get teleported. Only 1 person does.

Is there a way to make everyone inside that coordinates be teleported inside the Fight Pits once the timer hits 0?

Edit: Fixed.</description>

<p>Na, it was the WaitingRoom = 300;, SWAT tested it on his server and helped me with it. Thanks though.</p>
