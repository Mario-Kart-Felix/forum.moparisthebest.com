    <description>A large majority of topics in this section are not explained very well, easily seen by the first few posters asking to elaborate.  From now on, if you fail to be as specific as possible, your topic may be locked.  It is a complete waste of time for those who are trying to help if they have to post asking for you to elaborate.  So, if it means pictures, samples of code, and anything else you believe may be helpful to people who are trying to answer your question.

Just remember, the better you explain the problem you are experiencing, the better quality the replied posts will be, and the faster your issue will be resolved.</description>
