    <title>A Tip and A Tutorial</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-tip-and-a-tutorial/18055</link>
    <description>Ok, So far all the tutorials on getting on restricted sites at school involve opening &quot;command&quot; or &quot;CMD&quot;, typing the site and then an ip address(FOR EVERY PAGE!!)

so heres the tip: goto www.atunnel.com (anything from a-z should work ex: www.vtunnel.com)

if the site does not load then try a diffrent &quot;tunnel&quot;
also if it takes too long or does not show any pictures try another &quot;tunnel&quot;

wait for it to load, and there is a box at the buttom that you can type in an address and it will be unbloacked.
you also have some check boxes with options(the first two are &quot;checked&quot; by default)


The Tutorial:
Ok, this tutorial will let you have diffrent &quot;accesses&quot; on your account at school (it seems to very from school to school)

turn on the computer, type your name and password.
wait for it to say &quot;applying your personal setting&quot;(or somthing like that)
when you see that unplug your eathernet cord from the back of the computer(its probly blue if you dont know what im talking about lol)
now wait for it to be finnished everything and it might promped you that somthing is wrong (just hit &quot;ok&quot;) now you can plug the cord back in.


the only changes i have notaced is that that little &quot;lanschool&quot; program is not there so they can see what im doing(my cousin sayd at his school its still there but says &quot;not connected&quot; when he huvers his mouse over it.  also i have heard that some site on &quot;atunnel&quot;(or any other tunnel) are blocked but when you do this &quot;ethernet trick&quot; then they are unblocked.

other changes ive heard or notaced are you can access more files, but when you do this trick you are not on your account(technicly) so you can not access your own files.
this trick probly does more or has mnore uses i just havent notaced much more.



this just reminded me of another trick:
at my school this only works on the &quot;old white computers&quot; that run windows 98 or somthing.

when you log on you should see a box in the top left corner(probly only on the white computers)
click on the pox and keep hitting &quot;escape&quot; until you get a &quot;promp&quot; or &quot;popup&quot;
click on that &quot;promp&quot; or &quot;popup&quot; and keep hitting &quot;enter&quot; untill it goes back to the box again, repeat this a few times and h\then they will stop coming up.

this should give you access to more files and it has other uses too.

thanks ;D
