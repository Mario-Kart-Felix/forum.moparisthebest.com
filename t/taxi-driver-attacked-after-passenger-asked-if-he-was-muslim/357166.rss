    <title>Taxi driver attacked after passenger asked if he was Muslim</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;A 21-year-old man from upstate New York has been charged with attempted murder as a hate crime after allegedly asking his taxi driver if he was Muslim before slashing him in the face.

Michael Enright, of Brewster, N.Y., allegedly slashed taxi driver Ahmed Sharif, 43, around 6:15 p.m. Tuesday after Mr. Sharif had driven his passenger 16 blocks north to Midtown, police said.

According to an account of the incident by Sharif, provided through the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, Enright started out asking Sharif friendly questions, including how long he had been in the country, if he was Muslim and if was observing a fast during Ramadan.

Enright became silent for a few minutes and “then suddenly started cursing and screaming,” according to the account. Enright allegedly yelled, “Assalamu Alaikum. Consider this a checkpoint,” before slashing the driver.

Police said the allegations were still under investigation. What they would confirm was that Sharif picked up Enright at 24th Street and Second Avenue and drove to 3rd Avenue between 40 and 41 streets. Once there, Sharif locked the doors, left Enright in his taxi and called 911.

Sharif was taken to Bellevue Hospital where he was treated for a facial wound and released.

Police charged Enright with attempted murder as a hate crime, assault and criminal possession of a weapon. He was awaiting arraignment.

In late July, top NYPD officials convened a pre-Ramadan conference at police headquarters to discuss security issues with Muslim clergy, concerned citizens and dozens of Muslim police officers. At that time, police said there had been nine reported instances of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the city in 2010.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>Well the Koran burning has been canceled and the pastor agreed to meet with the leader of the mosque.</p>

</aside>
<p>It was cancelled because he thought the plans to build the mosque were cancelled. He has said he might rethink his descision now that he knows it’s not being relocated. It’s been in the news papers everyday for a month =/ One hell of a publicity stunt though. He should have made a webpage with info and advertisements for revenue. (edit: ok he’s not burning it no matter what now)</p>
<p>There was recently a huge stink in Canada because airport employees weren’t willing to argue with muslim women, so they simply let them board planes without removing their burqas etc (and thus not being able to identify them). A british passenger video taped this happening and put it on youtube. More investigation followed and they realized this was happening frequently at all major airports here. This is what happens when we leave our security in the hands of minimum wage students and foreigners.</p>

How is it not? You compared it to a dress. You cant hide a rifle under a dress and walk into a mall, and males wont wear dresses. However, if you really wanted to you could dress in the whole muslim outfit and no one would be sure what you were and you could easily get a rifle in a mall or other public place.</p>

Couldn’t tell you. I can say without a doubt that, television aside, I’ve never seen a christian nun in the traditional clothing. When I was a child and attended church, the nuns wore casual clothing.</p>
<p>With that said, I don’t support a piecemeal approach to security. I therefore advocate a simple blanket ban on all facial/head coverings in areas such as banks and airports.</p>

Doesnt matter, its for security reasons. You have to take your hoodie off when entering a school while being searched, along with airports. But a burqa conceals more and someone who isnt muslim could enter a mall with a rifle underneath.<br>

<p>Someone could just as easily wear a bike helmet and shoot up a bank, or stockings etc, but none of these items are banned…[/quote]<br>
Britain doesn’t outlaw wearing of motorcycle helmets into banks? For the record, you’re required to remove helmets in Australia – so my desire for such legislation isn’t for discriminating against them so much as it is about uniformity.</p>
