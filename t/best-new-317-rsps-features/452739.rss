    <title>Best new 317 RSPS features?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-new-317-rsps-features/452739</link>
    <description>I want to add even more new features to my server. I need to know what else to add. Please list all of your favorite new/old RSPS 317 features so that I can add them to my server and entertain my players more. Also, if you know of any good custom mini-game tutorials that are reallyy fun and can be re-done without hurting the economy and giving players plenty of amusement, I&#39;d love to know of some, or even some ideas so that I can do it myself. Thanks :)</description>

              <p>I’m kind of interested in making a full gambling server. no combat. Stats are useless <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> and all you do is gamble different ways with different npc’s and objects. can exchange gold(chips) for rare items, base cash is 5m. if run out of money type ::bankrupt lol.<br>
can have a stats page of richest players and keep track of number of bankruptcies <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> &lt;-- idk how i spelled that correctly without the spellcheck lol.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Dharma, post:2, topic:452739”]Pokemon. It should be something like summoning, except they get stronger as they beat other familiars. They should be categorized. Like grass, fire, and, water. They would have weaknesses. Instead of godwars you should make them bosses and you have to kill them all and beat the person who won before you. Then you get a reward.</p>
<p>Yup.<br>
I expect this to be finished in 2 weeks.[/quote]</p>
<p>eh, no.</p>
<p>Try adding most of Runescape’s old and best minigames such as Pest Control, Castle wars, duel arena, and also the games room where you play chess and stuff. Try adding quests, that’ll boost up the fun in the server. Also try adding more npcs and a stable economy to keep players playing.</p>
