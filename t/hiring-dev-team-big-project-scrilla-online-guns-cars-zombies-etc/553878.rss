    <title>Hiring [Dev Team] BIG PROJECT - Scrilla Online - Guns, Cars, Zombies, etc!</title>

    <description>Hey Everyone,

Recently I have decided to tackle a very big project which peaked my interest when I found a few concept pictures online of a game that was rapidly gaining popularity even before a release. Anyhow, I am searching for a team who can fulfill the following tasks:

What am I looking for?
- Server Developer (General: Fixes, Networking, Content, etc..)
- Client Developer (depends on what server this&#39;ll be planned out to be)
- Custom maps (all towns remade), items, NPCs etc
- new game engine if neccesary
- integrate custom music system
- Website integration (webclient, highscores, etc)

I understand this will be quite an expensive project to complete which is why I hope we can develop something for the rsps fanbase who would like a new twist on things.

To see what we are aiming towards with this project please visit:
