    <description>Ok, well if you are looking to advertise your website, then please tell me. I am willing to do a link exchange where I will put you on my sponsors list as long as you put a link on you website to mine... It is kinda like a partnering website... An add or just a link on say your homepage or forum, or any other part of your website is fine as long as it is visible. I will be putting you on my hompage under &quot;sponsors&quot;. So please post ehre if you would like to do this. I am willing to do with more than 1 person.</description>
