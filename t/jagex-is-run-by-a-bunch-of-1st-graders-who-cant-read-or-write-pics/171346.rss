    <title>Jagex is run by a bunch of 1st graders who can&#39;t read, or write... PICS</title>

    <description>Ok well the other day (yesterday to be exact) I was talking to a person who I know hacked me cause they are one of my friends, or at least used to be, and I read the ip adress that was last logged into my account when I logged on one day, noticed it was not my ip, and matched it with his, via hamachi. Well I was talking to him about it and he reported me, for god knows why. And this is everything that happened... I am now muted for 3 days.

BTW, rule 9= encouraging others to break the rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see they can not read the report, and cannont read an appeal, and lastly cannot type their own message... It&#39;s an automated message... I know cause they ahve sent the same message to me before...</description>

<p>No, they’re not exactly hypocrites, because macros give an unfair advantage over other players.  Their auto-banning gives them an unfair advantage over nothing.</p>

I’m just showing everyone how retarted jagex is… And they can’t interperet hamachi as mopar since hamachi is used for many other things… Thats like saying I have a website creator and they interperet that I am making porn with it just because I have a website maker. Mopar is a very SMALL catagory that falls under hamachi.<br>
EDIT: Not to mention that if he were using hamachi, it would be at his own will… No where in that evidence did i say “oh, go use hamachi” or “Play moparscape” I said I matched it with is ip on hamachi.</p>

              <p>Ok well the other day (yesterday to be exact) I was talking to a person who I know hacked me cause they are one of my friends, or at least used to be, and I read the ip adress that was last logged into my account when I logged on one day, noticed it was not my ip, and matched it with his, via hamachi. Well I was talking to him about it and he reported me, for god knows why. And this is everything that happened… I am now muted for 3 days.</p>
<p>BTW, rule 9= encouraging others to break the rules.</p>
