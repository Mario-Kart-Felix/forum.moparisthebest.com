Name : u see it<br>
age : u wont know it<br>
experience : im one of ur partner server<br>
UR experience : You leeched a 562 and a 317 for 1-2 months max.<br>
comment : i think u wont release this server and if u release it, it wont be ur work. lol u say u release dungeoneering 65% coded by u, u added a dungeoneering npc and u tele at the other boss when u kill it? this isnt dungeoneering. And you got ::tele to work cause its already working…<br>
And you got more players cause me its a pk only server on a 10% coded source, your server is a skilling, killing and pking server on a painzone leech. but your players dont know so u think its ok. who will donate for a stupid leech? its not ur work. and you cant port forward a d-link. so u think u can make a 614??<br>
finally : if u release this server, it wont be ur work. u dont have the experience.</p>

age - 18<br>
country - U.S.A<br>
languages - English, and some German.</p>
<p>I would like to join this development team because I believe with little effort, and some development, we can rise this server to the top. If you haven’t already created an intellectual Game Engine to your server, I can help with that along with some key-tools. I don’t want to be staff, I want to be coder. I’m not going to be thought of as someone’s servant, fuck that pussy shit,</p>

I have ALOT of experience in 317 coding, although i realise this dose not help with a 613 at all, but i have had experience in 562 servers also, im not a great coder but i am good staff.[/li][/list]<br>

[li]Why would you like to be on this development team? - Because i beleive this server could go far if enough people put the effort into it, i have a huge intrest in 562 + and i have not found a 613/614 that has an Eco, they all are usually Pvp and Pickup. I hope i get a spot on the team, look forward to hearing from you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> [/li]<br>

<p>Please explain the immaturity you see? I highly doubt a 9 year old what have such a vocabulary to use the word “hence” I must be a genius 9 year old. Again please explain how my thinking isn’t right. I think your just trying to change the topic since I have figured out what your trying to do. You have been caught, now stop trying create a diversion with this whole “immaturity” act and if I’m wrong, prove it by giving them a different kind of task that doesn’t involve fixing your 562 server. I think that is a reasonable demand, if your not guilty of what I’m accusing you of.</p>

              <p>My rank on these forum mean nothing…I also not asking like shit… You and I both know that making people fix your work in a fake advertisement isn’t right because this is exactly what it seems like. You cannot figure out your own 562 server so you put up a 613/614 advertisement because you know if they apply  for it they must know how to some what code, so to “prove” themselves you have them fix your problems ion your 562 server. That’s what this looks like to me…hence why I said what I said.</p>
