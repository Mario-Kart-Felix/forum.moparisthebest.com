    <title>Java Network library and client application?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-network-library-and-client-application/497881</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not looking for anything that takes rocket science to implement but something nice and easy to work with for [b]sending [/b]xml, binary, json and other serialized messages including error checking, write and read. 

Does anybody know what type of networking would be best for this and efficiency because I used IO at first, but I wanted it to get abstracts from sockets. Using buffers seems logical but I&#39;m looking for something that is reliable which is easy and time efficient not forgetting &#39;noob friendly&#39; when working with it.  

I&#39;ve looked at https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/ which has given me some interests. Security and speed would also need to be covered. 

Any suggestions?</description>

              <p>You can use any of the libraries we use in the server for the client as well, its just written differently. They all depend on what you’re doing and how abstract you want to keep it</p>
