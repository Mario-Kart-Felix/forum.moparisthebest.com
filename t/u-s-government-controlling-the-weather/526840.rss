    <title>U.S. Government Controlling the Weather?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/u-s-government-controlling-the-weather/526840</link>
    <description>HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program), first created by the U.S. Navy and Air Force, is supposedly able to control or manipulate the weather and can cause earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanoes to erupt, etc. by shooting rays of energy into the ionosphere. HAARP is now controlled by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), a program that creates the weapons for the U.S. Military, to supposedly create weapons with the weather.

In Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Ontario, Canada, the local people here consistent hums throughout the week and the sound shakes their houses/windows that come from the island, Zug Island, that is along the river that divides Windsor, Ontario, Canada and Detroit, Michigan. Some people believe that HAARP is the cause of this and that it can also create earthquakes.

HAARP is also supposedly collecting anti matter and storing it in the magnetosphere.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you believe it or not?

Personally, I don&#39;t doubt it because the U.S. government likes to keep things a secret and is usually something that the citizens don&#39;t particularly like.

If you watch SyFy&#39;s Joe Rogan Questions Everything - Weaponized Weather episode, you would see that they go in much more detail and talk to people who know what they&#39;re talking about and even an ex-employee of HAARP.</description>

              <p>I would love to know how you propose this energy being shot into the ionosphere is causing earthquakes and how they are collecting anti matter. To me it sounds like they threw anti matter in to scare people because most people don’t know what it is and it sounds scary and is pretty ridiculous to think they are really doing this. I don’t see how shooting energy into the ionosphere is going to cause a volcanoe to erupt. Perhaps I missed something.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Taharok, post:37, topic:526840”]I find it hilarious that so many people are under the delusion that the US Government is made up of a bunch of super geniuses who can do anything they want to. Just because we don’t know exactly what most of the internal projects are doesn’t mean we don’t have some clue of what is possible. Much of what the US Government does isn’t a ton different from many public working theories, or implementations of other governments.</p>
<p>Long story short: they can’t just control the weather lol. That doesn’t mean they cant affect weather patterns minutely, but really. You listed a bunch of things this so-called system does, yet many of them are unrelated to each other. How can a single system affect so many unrelated variables simultaneously? Not to mention, spend a minute to think how it’s logically possible. I’m a skeptic because logic is not that difficult to work out. I don’t doubt people haven’t come up with solutions for changing some of these variables, but the actual cost of building a machine to do it or even running the machine is likely astronomical (especially the ones related to plate tectonics). Nevertheless, let’s not forget about serious natural repercussions for fudgeing with some of this stuff.</p>
<p>ITT: people that like to believe conspiracies and will believe whatever bullshit is fed to them because it makes a good argument. Not to mention we’ll get people in here (like me) spewing a bunch of logic saying it’s either very unlikely or impossible, and we’ll get replies with “you can’t prove it” or “you would believe that” or some other non-argument reply.</p>
<p>K, done with my infrequent conspiracy theory rant.[/quote]<br>
I find it hilarious how you have a better insight than other people that have posted on this thread. I’m not debating whether I agree/disagree with you, I’m just stating it’s funny how you think you know better than others.</p>
<p>Frell, I don’t know whether to laugh or be offended… You really do think Muslims are a bunch of loonies, don’t you? I’m not going to bother telling you that you shouldn’t be like that but the value of shit you get for being a different ethnicity (i.e. oriental) is unreal; have some consideration. I really don’t like how the US is run but a fair % of bad things that have happened were voted by the people but I’m not like lets treat Americans like their assholes.<br>
FYI it actually isn’t that hard to get into fairly secure places that have high traffic, so if Muslims are really that bad then you’d see a lot more deaths related to terrorism &amp; their are many types of Muslim so you should stereotype them all together (I think theirs 8?).<br>
I worded this a bit weirdly but that’s because of some things I cba explaining.</p>

<p>Christian terrorism comprises terrorist acts by groups or individuals who profess Christian motivations or goals.   The early modern period in Britain saw religious conflict resulting from the Reformation and the introduction of Protestant state churches. The 1605 Gunpowder Plot was a failed attempt by a group of English Catholics including Guy Fawkes to assassinate King James I, and to blow up the Palace of Westminster, the English seat of government. According to Vahabph D. Aghai, "The beginnin...</p>

I probably don’t need to check to know that there are more Muslim terrorist attacks than Christian (in modern times) But remember both are small groups compared to the mass. A lot of militant groups could hardly be considered muslim either.</p>
<p>i also think the religion is irrelevant anyways (edit: but probably not totally), osama bin laden did not state the reason for the attack was because of differing religions. It was retaliation against the united states.</p>

<p>Don’t worry. I always spot out the lunatics when I get on a plane. It’s just precaution and how I am going to handle the situation.

              <p>What</p>
<p>You can’t blame people for getting nervous when a Muslim gets on their plane for example, or for the TSA checking them. Would you rather risk another plane going down and hundreds dying just because you didn’t want to hurt someones feelings? It doesn’t mean they’re all terrorists at all. But the way the mind works is its going to see muslims as a <span class="bbcode-i">possible</span> threat in those scenarios simply because of their track record. When I was in highschool if I saw an “off” looking white guy walking towards the building with a trenchcoat/all black clothes I’d start to get nervous also. It’s not just with muslims. Its perfectly human to profile and people telling you to ignore this instinct are the ones who are ignoring obvious patterns.</p>
<p>Saying be wary just meant be cautious, it doesn’t mean accuse all of them.</p>
<p>And no not all of them dislike western culture, Iraq has had alot of exposure to it in the past 2 years and they enjoy it (but miss the military stability under Saddam). Its mostly the older traditional radical Islamist that feel like western culture is our “disease” to spread Christianity to them.</p>
<p>The issue is they still think the crusades are going on. /nutshell</p>

<p>I used an example of British girls: <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/08/09/19943559-acid-attack-leaves-british-teens-volunteering-on-zanzibar-burned-beyond-imagination?lite">http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/08/09/19943559-acid-attack-leaves-british-teens-volunteering-on-zanzibar-burned-beyond-imagination?lite</a></p>
<p>And I think its odd you think they specifically hate America. They hate western culture as a whole, there are many attacks outside of America. They view any westerners in their countries as infidel. You can even watch the VICE documentary of a Canadian journalist. He walked through a small town and as soon as people started realizing they were westernized people started taking out cell phones. Guy hosting the show threw up a red flag and they had to run to their truck. They interviewed an Iraq rock band and they all said if people saw them walking down the street with a guitar they’d get death threats.</p>
<p>And when did I say all Muslims are terrorists? Profiling is a defense mechanism/survival instinct. But I didn’t say every single one was a terrorist. I’ve even used the word extremist a few times.</p>

<p>I had never heard about that, but there are many reasons why that could have happened. Depending on where they were working, those who live there may have been terrorised by Caucasians before. They may have not been able to tell the difference between the girls and those who intimidated them. I wouldn’t be surprised if people in that area begin to terrorise any Caucasians that are in that area. They may be no better at telling the difference between Americans and the English then we are at telling the difference between them.</p>
<p>However, I’m not sure this quite relates to your statement above saying all Muslims are terrorists. From my understanding it is the Taliban that produce terrorist attacks, not every religion that lives in the middle east. It is very bias to say that Muslims alone attack america, when it isn’t true. I’ve also heard that america trained the Taliban to fight the Russians and enabled them access to weapons. Doesn’t it sound odd to you that America trained a group that plants attacks on them?</p>
