    <title>Looking For Partners</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-partners/519272</link>
    <description>I am looking for partners that can help me with the development of the webclient maker. I am not the [b]best[/b] with PHP but I know enough to make this thing work enough. I am looking for about 2-3 people that are proficient in PHP and SQL. HTML &amp; CSS are optional because I can do all of that myself.

Why am I looking for partners? Well, the webclient maker has grown up alot, I have gotten roughly 1,000 downloads so far. This is huge for me, I never though anything I have ever made would get as popular as this script has. 

[b]Payment:[/b]

Sorry, no payment will be involved. MoparScape doesn&#39;t allow it and I can&#39;t afford it. These position will be purely voluntary.

[b]Contact Me: [/b]

PM me on MoparScape. Include past projects, proof of experience, etc.</description>

<p>Vouch for him.</p>
<p>OT: If I could help with it I would. Making a site with a webclient maker has been something I wanted to do for a while but never got around to doing. If you want some of my ideas on how I was going to make the site successful, I’d be happy to share them with you.</p>

</aside>
<p>That doesn’t mean you can help more than anyone, it just means you have experience with it. His code isn’t going to be the same as yours is(was?). Anyone with a good understanding and knowledge of PHP would be as good as the next guy is :).</p>
