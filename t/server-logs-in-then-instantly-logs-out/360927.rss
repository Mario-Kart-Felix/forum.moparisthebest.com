    <title>Server logs in then instantly logs out</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-logs-in-then-instantly-logs-out/360927</link>
    <description>Alright, well the problem is; when I log into the server I automatically log out like instantly and it continues to log me out, the server is online and on port 43594 on which I have port forwarded. The error message I get is: Error:&quot; T2 - 126,126,126 - 12,0,0 - 80,111,105,110,116,115,58,32,48,10,76,-59,&quot; That&#39;s from the Moparscape client. This is what the server command says. [Riotday] Connected - Game saved for player Riotday - [Riotday] Disconnected . I&#39;m not sure of this problem and you&#39;re help would greatly be appreciated. I&#39;m also using a 317 source, I&#39;ve actually tried all types of sources.


Thanks,
Riot</description>
