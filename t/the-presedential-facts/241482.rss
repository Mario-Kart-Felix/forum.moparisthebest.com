    <description>[b]First off, Go to google, go anywhere. I wrote this myself. If you say I didn&#39;t, provide a link. I DARE YOU.[/b]

				Barack Obama.
So it&#39;s not much of a secret who I was voting for in the 2008 presidential election.
Now yes, I am a registered democrat and I tend to attach more to what the democrats 

have stated then republicans. But that&#39;s MY opinion. The point of this, is to tell WHY I&#39;ve voted for Barack Obama.

	Now, I&#39;m not saying that I agree 100% with Barack Obama. In fact, I tend to 

only agree with around 70% of his plans. but would this still keep me from voting for 

him? No. I would vote not on the plans, but I admire him, for his integrity to stnad up 

for what he thinks is wrong even when It&#39;s un popular to do that.

	While a candidates issues on, immagration, taxation, economics, ect, certainly 

do matter, what matters more to me especially when were dealing with an Executive 

position liek the presedency, is our personal qualities. I&#39;m not talking about things 

like a life story, memories, yet i&#39;m talking about things like temperment, manegerial 

skills, and intelectual curiosity. 

	Just think of this. Here in texas, there may be a number of voters, who vote 

for there candidate souly on one issue, such as abortion. well yes, the president does 

play a PART in the abortion issue, one presidents point of justices are not enough to 

change the whole abortion issues. This applies however to many issues the cheif 

executive does play a part at the small issue at hand, but the fate of any given issue 

does not rest in the fate of the president, NEARLY as much, as most people think.

	My basic point I&#39;m trying to make is even if you disagree with Obama on some 

issues, when voting for president in my opinion, there are much more important things 

to consider. The last 8 years have not at all been great for america under the 

leadership of george bush, and yes, it&#39;s done enourmous damage to how we&#39;re viewed by 

the rest of the world...

	But the most important issue TO ME, is who can BEST restore our national 

standing, in the eyes, of the international communities. We are the most powerful 

nation in the world, that is a fact, but in order for that power to mean anything, we 

MUST maintain the respect, in the eyes of the rest of the world. So which candidate 

will best repair our standing in the eyes of the international community? I don&#39;t think 

there&#39;s much choice.. Barack Obama.

	Lets think. John McCain wants to continue most of George Bush&#39; policies, as do 

most republicans. Now you can think whatever you want about that, but the fact of the 

matter is the continuation of george bush&#39; polocies DEFINATELY ARE NOT, a popular 

standpoint, from anyone in these united states. If we were to elect John McCain 

president, the world would therefor see this election, as a failed attempt of the 

united states, to provide and end, to the George W. Bush era. In return, our 

internationally inpopularity would become a very difficult imposition towards Senator 

McCain.

	Obama, on the oher hand, Is wildly popular internationally and in the eyes of 

the international community, Barack IS SEEN as americas great chance to redeem itself 

from these last 8 years. Restored favoribility in the eyes of the international 

community would ONCE AGAIN allow america, to use its power, to the fullest.

	My opinion as well as 70+% of americans, is that Barack Obama would be a much 

more successful cheif diplomat, than McCain.

	Keep in mind that is ONLY the international side of things. If I wanted to I 

could go through Domestic governments. This is our time.
This is the time for america, This is the time for you, the time for me, and the time 

for laby liberty, to return its standpoint, AS THE MOST POWERFUL NATION EVER!

<p>That’s the kind of attitude that makes the US such a shitty country. All you fags care about is the image of the president. What you don’t understand is, that the US is actually quite close to a dictatorship. Actually, it’s a dictatorship with freedom of speech (as far as its possible). You can only choose from two parties: Democrats and Republicans. In a democratic country all party’s get an equal amount of media attention, but is that true in the US? NO! And secondly, in a democratic country representatives of the population rule the country. See that word: <span class="bbcode-b">representatives</span>. Yes, its a plural. Not one president.</p>
<p>And the bullshit called ‘Electoral college’ doesn’t work either. What if one candidate has one less vote in every state? He gets no votes at all? Keep in mind that ‘the winner takes all’.</p>

Wow, you registered as a Democrat at the age of 14? Way to go on stealing that.<br>

Registered meaning active with the community of democrats, I won’t be legally registered till 18.[/quote]</p>
<p>You weren’t legally registered as a democrat, but you legally voted at the age of 14. I get it.</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">First off, Go to google, go anywhere. I wrote this myself. If you say I didn’t, provide a link. I DARE YOU.</span></p>
<pre><code>			Barack Obama.
</code></pre>
<p>So it’s not much of a secret who I was voting for in the 2008 presidential election.<br>
Now yes, I am a registered democrat and I tend to attach more to what the democrats</p>
<p>have stated then republicans. But that’s MY opinion. The point of this, is to tell WHY I’ve voted for Barack Obama.</p>
<pre><code>Now, I'm not saying that I agree 100% with Barack Obama. In fact, I tend to 
</code></pre>
<p>only agree with around 70% of his plans. but would this still keep me from voting for</p>
<p>him? No. I would vote not on the plans, but I admire him, for his integrity to stnad up</p>
<p>for what he thinks is wrong even when It’s un popular to do that.</p>
<pre><code>While a candidates issues on, immagration, taxation, economics, ect, certainly 
</code></pre>
<p>do matter, what matters more to me especially when were dealing with an Executive</p>
<p>position liek the presedency, is our personal qualities. I’m not talking about things</p>
<p>like a life story, memories, yet i’m talking about things like temperment, manegerial</p>
<p>skills, and intelectual curiosity.</p>
<pre><code>Just think of this. Here in texas, there may be a number of voters, who vote 
</code></pre>
<p>for there candidate souly on one issue, such as abortion. well yes, the president does</p>
<p>play a PART in the abortion issue, one presidents point of justices are not enough to</p>
<p>change the whole abortion issues. This applies however to many issues the cheif</p>
<p>executive does play a part at the small issue at hand, but the fate of any given issue</p>
<p>does not rest in the fate of the president, NEARLY as much, as most people think.</p>
<pre><code>My basic point I'm trying to make is even if you disagree with Obama on some 
</code></pre>
<p>issues, when voting for president in my opinion, there are much more important things</p>
<p>to consider. The last 8 years have not at all been great for america under the</p>
<p>leadership of george bush, and yes, it’s done enourmous damage to how we’re viewed by</p>
<p>the rest of the world…</p>
<pre><code>But the most important issue TO ME, is who can BEST restore our national 
</code></pre>
<p>standing, in the eyes, of the international communities. We are the most powerful</p>
<p>nation in the world, that is a fact, but in order for that power to mean anything, we</p>
<p>MUST maintain the respect, in the eyes of the rest of the world. So which candidate</p>
<p>will best repair our standing in the eyes of the international community? I don’t think</p>
<p>there’s much choice… Barack Obama.</p>
<pre><code>Lets think. John McCain wants to continue most of George Bush' policies, as do 
</code></pre>
<p>most republicans. Now you can think whatever you want about that, but the fact of the</p>
<p>matter is the continuation of george bush’ polocies DEFINATELY ARE NOT, a popular</p>
<p>standpoint, from anyone in these united states. If we were to elect John McCain</p>
<p>president, the world would therefor see this election, as a failed attempt of the</p>
<p>united states, to provide and end, to the George W. Bush era. In return, our</p>
<p>internationally inpopularity would become a very difficult imposition towards Senator</p>
<p>McCain.</p>
<pre><code>Obama, on the oher hand, Is wildly popular internationally and in the eyes of 
</code></pre>
<p>the international community, Barack IS SEEN as americas great chance to redeem itself</p>
<p>from these last 8 years. Restored favoribility in the eyes of the international</p>
<p>community would ONCE AGAIN allow america, to use its power, to the fullest.</p>
<pre><code>My opinion as well as 70+% of americans, is that Barack Obama would be a much 
</code></pre>
<p>more successful cheif diplomat, than McCain.</p>
<pre><code>Keep in mind that is ONLY the international side of things. If I wanted to I 
</code></pre>
<p>could go through Domestic governments. This is our time.<br>
This is the time for america, This is the time for you, the time for me, and the time</p>
<p>for laby liberty, to return its standpoint, AS THE MOST POWERFUL NATION EVER!<br>
