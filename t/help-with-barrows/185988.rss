    <title>Help with barrows</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-barrows/185988</link>
    <description>Ok... so I am attempting a 100% (or as close as I can get) barrows minigame. The only problem, i&#39;ve never attempted the barrows on real rs, so I am forced to get all of my information from videos and screenshots on fansites and youtube. So far, I have the basic game created, and It would help if you guys could watch this video I took and comment on things that need to be added / are incorrect.

              <p>[quote=“Ixl Adds Ixl, post:2, topic:185988”]When you start a fight with a monster its suppose to go away the next 20 seconds after combat ends.<br>
They are single-man combat only.<br>
They should walked through walls or objects.<br>
The spinning head should only appear when you arr low on prayer - which only appears on the last boss and the wreck.<br>
When praying, the monster shouldn’t be able to hit you period. Whats the use of praying if it doesn’t protect you?<br>
In the huge basement, there are monsters down there. The last guy should only appear once you open the box or if another guy dies and you see him he should aggressively attack you asap.[/quote]</p>
<p>yeah cba to add monsters in the tunnel, and the monster hit me when i was praying because i forgot to make him range instead of melee (so protect melee would have protected me).</p>
<p>thanks for the tip on the spinning head, and the thing about them walking through objects, thats a movement glitch on like every server ever made.</p>
<p>thanks for the comments <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
