    <title>Help Converting RSPS ints</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-converting-rsps-ints/400731</link>
    <description>Hey guys this happens to be my first post so if it is in the wrong section I apologize and hope you can tell me so that I can move it. I have a problem with ints for my RSPS. It is Project Insanity source. Recently, I have tried to add torva, virtus, and pernix. Are those the right names? If not correct me there too. :p I got a different form of ints that I am not really familiar with and was thinking maybe you guys could help me convert, point me to a tool that will convert it for me, or send me different ints and models for torva. Here&#39;s what the ints are supposed to look like with the correct format.

		case 13893:
			itemDef.name = &quot;Vesta&#39;s plateskirt&quot;;
			itemDef.actions = new String[5];
			itemDef.actions[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
			itemDef.modelID = 42581;
			itemDef.modelZoom = 1753;
			itemDef.modelRotation1 = 562;
			itemDef.modelRotation2 = 1;
			itemDef.modelOffset2 = 11;
			itemDef.modelOffset1 = -3;
			itemDef.anInt204 = 0;
			itemDef.maleEquip1 = 42633;
			itemDef.femaleEquip1 = 42647;
			itemDef.description = &quot;Vesta&#39;s plateskirt.&quot;.getBytes();
			break;



Here&#39;s what they look like now.


          case 20135:
                  itemDef.modelID = 62714;
                  itemDef.name = &quot;Torva full helm&quot;;
