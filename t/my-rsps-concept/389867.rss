    <title>My RSPS Concept</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-rsps-concept/389867</link>
    <description>Seeing as I quit the RSPS scene altogether I&#39;ll post my &quot;masterpiece&quot; idea I&#39;ve always had. This can be a community project and eventually released or whatever. If enough people actually want to work on it and such. I&#39;ve just really always wanted to see it completed.

First off this was concepted for a 317 server. When you reach 200,000,000 experience in a skill you would be given the opportunity at your will to teleport to the RuneScape&#39;s God&#39;s Temple and receive a God Cape of Accomplishment in said skill. You get to decide which god you receive it from, but it doesn&#39;t matter. Each god is sitting in a throne. With these capes comes a new set of emotes and effects. Effects affect your gameplay whether you are wearing the cape or not.

Attack:
   Emote: Does two roundhouse kicks in succession and then jumps in the air. Your character seems to float there as he does multiple superman punches. Then he lands on his feet and it is over. Each kick/punch would have flames around them almost like they are breaking the sound barrier.
   Effect: Never ever hits a 0 with melee attacks.

Strength:
   Emote: Pick up a huge boulder and throws it/picks up the world and carries it on his back.
   Effect: 10% chance of hitting double your max hit.

Defence:
   Emote: Arrow flies at the character and the character simply catches it with both of his hands like praying and tosses it aside. A magic fireball is blasted at the character and he brushes it aside. A boulder is hurled and the character and he crosses his arms in front of his face and the boulder smashes to dust on impact.
   Effect: 25% chance of reducing a hit by half

Ranged:
   Emote: Shoots an arrow high up into the sky and as it comes down he shoots another arrow and break the arrow descending in half.
   Effect: Never hit a 0 with ranged weapons.

Magic:
   Emote: Shoots an air blast similar to air surge, then causes a mini wave to come from the side, then causes a huge pillar of Earth to rise from the ground, then a wall of fire surrounds the player.
   Effect: Half of runes are required for spells.

Prayer:
   Emote: Character clasps his hands together and bows his head, and a aura seems to envelop the character. A sword is swung at the player but is recoiled by the aura. Three arrows are shot at the player, but the aura acts as a shield and they clatter to the ground. A magic fireball is casted at the player and it seems to envelop the player, but the player is left unscathed because the aura acted as a shield. The player unclasps his hands and looks up. The aura seems to dissipate and a shadowy figure is seen above him, watching over him.
   Effects:1/2 of prayer points consumed while praying.

(I&#39;m going to skip a few skills and put blanks later as typing on a small iPod with big fingers is annoying. I&#39;ll only put the ones down I have emotes for now.)

Agility:
   Emote: Does a barrellroll and then does two back flips in one jump.
   Effect: unlimited running

Slayer:
   Emote: Tussels with a dark beast barehandedly, finally grabs it by the heand and slams it into the ground. Then the player places one foot on the dark beast like a captain Morgan pose.
   Effect: Requires no slayer equipment and slayer monster effects are useless.

That&#39;s all of the skills I thought up while concepting this idea. Hopefully this will inspire one of you to finish what I never accomplished.</description>

<p>I looked into it and the only problem you might have is having too many frames. MrP explained how could split them up, but I couldn’t really understand what he was saying as it had a lot to do with coding haha. I’m pretty sure rsposer can handle all of this, just you would have to know what you are doing to get the desired result.</p>

              <p>Seeing as I quit the RSPS scene altogether I’ll post my “masterpiece” idea I’ve always had. This can be a community project and eventually released or whatever. If enough people actually want to work on it and such. I’ve just really always wanted to see it completed.</p>
<p>First off this was concepted for a 317 server. When you reach 200,000,000 experience in a skill you would be given the opportunity at your will to teleport to the RuneScape’s God’s Temple and receive a God Cape of Accomplishment in said skill. You get to decide which god you receive it from, but it doesn’t matter. Each god is sitting in a throne. With these capes comes a new set of emotes and effects. Effects affect your gameplay whether you are wearing the cape or not.</p>
<p>Attack:<br>
Emote: Does two roundhouse kicks in succession and then jumps in the air. Your character seems to float there as he does multiple superman punches. Then he lands on his feet and it is over. Each kick/punch would have flames around them almost like they are breaking the sound barrier.<br>
Effect: Never ever hits a 0 with melee attacks.</p>
<p>Strength:<br>
Emote: Pick up a huge boulder and throws it/picks up the world and carries it on his back.<br>
Effect: 10% chance of hitting double your max hit.</p>
<p>Defence:<br>
Emote: Arrow flies at the character and the character simply catches it with both of his hands like praying and tosses it aside. A magic fireball is blasted at the character and he brushes it aside. A boulder is hurled and the character and he crosses his arms in front of his face and the boulder smashes to dust on impact.<br>
Effect: 25% chance of reducing a hit by half</p>
<p>Ranged:<br>
Emote: Shoots an arrow high up into the sky and as it comes down he shoots another arrow and break the arrow descending in half.<br>
Effect: Never hit a 0 with ranged weapons.</p>
<p>Magic:<br>
Emote: Shoots an air blast similar to air surge, then causes a mini wave to come from the side, then causes a huge pillar of Earth to rise from the ground, then a wall of fire surrounds the player.<br>
Effect: Half of runes are required for spells.</p>
<p>Prayer:<br>
Emote: Character clasps his hands together and bows his head, and a aura seems to envelop the character. A sword is swung at the player but is recoiled by the aura. Three arrows are shot at the player, but the aura acts as a shield and they clatter to the ground. A magic fireball is casted at the player and it seems to envelop the player, but the player is left unscathed because the aura acted as a shield. The player unclasps his hands and looks up. The aura seems to dissipate and a shadowy figure is seen above him, watching over him.<br>
Effects:1/2 of prayer points consumed while praying.</p>
<p>(I’m going to skip a few skills and put blanks later as typing on a small iPod with big fingers is annoying. I’ll only put the ones down I have emotes for now.)</p>
<p>Agility:<br>
Emote: Does a barrellroll and then does two back flips in one jump.<br>
Effect: unlimited running</p>
<p>Slayer:<br>
Emote: Tussels with a dark beast barehandedly, finally grabs it by the heand and slams it into the ground. Then the player places one foot on the dark beast like a captain Morgan pose.<br>
Effect: Requires no slayer equipment and slayer monster effects are useless.</p>
<p>That’s all of the skills I thought up while concepting this idea. Hopefully this will inspire one of you to finish what I never accomplished.</p>
