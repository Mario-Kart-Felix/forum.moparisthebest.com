I’m not sure, but I think you forgot some things like brackets etc.[/quote]</p>
<p>There were 2 errors I had to fix,<br>
One of them, I accidentally hit enter creating a new line.<br>
The other was I forgot a quotation mark.  I did this on accident, (Jamie")) Instead of (“Jamie”)</p>
<p>Lol, but thanks though, you’re helping me alot(:</p>
