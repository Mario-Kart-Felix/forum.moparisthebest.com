It’s possible but here’s something you should know. Last person that made a client with Jagex’s newer graphics(503s and 508s)got sued and shut down by Jagex.<br>
[/quote]<br>
The way to avoid that is by making an agreement on your homepage before anyone can even see the webclient that the viewer is not a member of jagex, or a friend/family member of one.[/quote]</p>
<p>does anyone know if this will compleatly block jagex? It would be nice to make a webclient for my 562</p>
