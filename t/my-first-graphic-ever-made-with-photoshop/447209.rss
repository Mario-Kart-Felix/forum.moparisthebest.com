    <title>My first graphic ever made with photoshop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-first-graphic-ever-made-with-photoshop/447209</link>
    <description>Hello guys,
I ever started with photoshop 3 years ago.
My friend didnt wanted his license anymore and gived it to me.
So i wanted to try some things in photoshop , new things i never know they were there.
this was what i made :
[img]http://i49.tinypic.com/2415wk2.jpg[/img]
This was my first graphic , If u see its all Abstract.
I worked my first designs out in a theme , this one was Abstract...
But i stopped for two years cuz school and a half year ago i picked the license up and started back
(I found this graphic on my old hard disk)

Regards,
~Ircdscape (Sorry for my bad english  ;D )</description>
