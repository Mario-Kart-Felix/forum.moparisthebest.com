    <title>At what ages do you go to the doctor?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/at-what-ages-do-you-go-to-the-doctor/78681</link>
    <description>I was wondering.. I want to smoke some pot but I don&#39;t want to get caught with a piss test. If you know the ages, could you let me know?
I thought it was like.. 3, 5, 9,12 and then up to like 16</description>

<p>It’s not something I would worry about, we used to do it on the street on the way to school everyday. Unless for some reason a cop is coming to walk by I don’t think you have to worry.</p>

              <p>Um, what?</p>
<p>I mean, I just had a blood and urine test for the first time in my life and that was because my appendix exploded. They still didn’t find any drugs. They wont find them unless they specifically look for them, which costs money.</p>
<p>If you know you have an appointment to test for drugs, which is really weird to have something randomly thrown at you, just don’t smoke pot for about 2 weeks before and drink lots of water.</p>
