Hello all,

I have been learning to code a lot lately and I am developing this new server that I call Mozilla, but I encountered a few problems as I&#39;ve never tried combat on this server: 
1. Auto-retaliate doesnt work.
2. Special Attacks dont work. 

Here is a video that shows what is happening:

Looking for a response, thanks</description>

              <p>First of all, it isn’t correct to say “Doesn’t work” because servers are made from the bottom up meaning that things “haven’t been added” so you’re saying that your server has not added auto retaliate and special attacks. Now first of all I think that special attacks have been added because have you seen the difference in the hits from no spec to spec? Specials hit 200+ and normals hit 30-40. The only issue with the spec is that they are custom, meaning that they don’t use the same GFX and animations as runescape did. Auto Retaliate is a bit tricky, but the concept is simple. Look for where the server changes the auto retaliate button and sets it to on. There add a method that makes the player begin the attack sequence when an NPC attacks the player.</p>
