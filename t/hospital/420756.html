<p>So today, me and my friend planned to go to a nightclub. We met eachother in Antwerp city at around 11 PM and 10 minutes later, a girl and a guy arrived aswell. They were also coming with us. But we were not complete yet. There were 2 more guys that were suppose to come with us.<br>
They told us they would arrive in about a half hour. So we planned to get some drinks before going to the club while waiting on those 2 guys.</p>
<p>We bought a big bottle of whisky from the local pakistan store. My friend and I were not first time drinkers, we have drunk before: whisky, vodka,…<br>
And since we never actually got drunk from drinking a lot of those strong drinks, we thought, let’s fuck this whyisky up.</p>
<p>So we went to the park (my friend, I, the girl and the guy) and started drinking that fucking whisky from the bottle. I had not eaten anything that day.</p>
<p>I drank 50% of that bottle, my friend and the others drank the other 50% together. I remember the first 30 minutes after I took my last gulp from the damn whisky. The first 5 minutes my world started to turn around like fuck, I was like, I know I’m drunk, and I’m trying to be normal, but my fucking head is spinning like fuck. So I was pretty sober. 10 minutes later, I had trouble talking, I was thinking perfect, like I am now, but I just couldn’t talk. And finally another 10 minutes, my legs shut off and I couldn’t walk anymore. That’s all I remember. Then I woke up at 5 AM in the hospital.</p>
<p>Noone was there and I was fucked. I was sober again but had to puke a couple of times. Then I called one of the doctors, asked him when, who and how I was brought here. He told me my dad visited me 2 hours ago, so I was pretty much fucked and that they took me in from the ambulance. He also was suprised I spoke perfect Dutch.</p>
<p>I couldn’t do anything at that time so I decided to get some sleep. And I did, then at 8 AM my dad came, took me home, was a little mad, not so much because this was the first time I got into a drunk hospital situation.</p>
<p>Anyhow, after I got some sleep home, my friend came over and told me what happend.<br>
Basicly after those 30 minutes he told me that I was wasted, puking, falling asleep, and not able to use my legs. So he told those 2 (guy and girl) to go to Bredabaan and wait there, until he got back after carrying me home. He planned to go to that club without me but with those 2.</p>
<p>The problem was, those 2 were also wasted, not so much as I was, but they were unable to think and talk normal.</p>
<p>My friend carried me in the metro, and some guy came with 2 other large built guys telling my friend to get the fuck away, that he was a doctor and that he would fix me.</p>
<p>One of that doctors friends pushed my friend telling him to get the fuck away, after my friend told him to leave him and me the fuck alone and mind their own business. My friend is only 5.4 ft like me, but unlike me, he was sober, he is a MMA and wrestling club champion, he has trained MMA and wrestling his whole life and has a LOT of muscle (all from doing pushups and situps his whole life, no fitness boolshit).</p>
<p>So he knocked those guys out, and that doctor took a run for it. Anyhow, after exiting the metero and finally arriving in my street, some fucking Belgians saw us and called an ambulance. And that’s when they took me to the hospital.</p>
<p>He also called those other 2 (the guy and the girl) telling them that he was going home and that they should also go home.<br>
They were still waiting on my friend at 2 AM on Bredabaan and since there were no busses at that hour to that club wich was 40 KM away from them, they called a taxi.<br>
Unlike in America, taxis in belgium cost 40 dollars. So they spent all their money on that taxi, and when they arrived at the club, they had no more money to pay for tickets.</p>
<p>So, that’s that, also, appreantly, I spoke Armenian to all those doctors when I was brought in so they were suprised when I started speaking Dutch. They asked my dad how come a 17 year old dude living most of his life in Belgium doesn’t speak the language.</p>
<p>Also, my dad told me that because we drank from the whisky bottle itself, a lot of spirt fumes got in our bodies, that normally should not have gone in our bodies (when you drink from a glass) and that that was the main reason why I was wasted.</p>

        <p>One day I was sitting in the living room after my dad (who had recently had an achillies tendon surgary) had gone for a roll in his wheelchair, to get exercise. He said his chest hurt, but he has asthma so he had thought it was just that. About 10 minutes later he said it was affecting in other places, but we decided he should just go to bed. I am going about my night, got to sleep than at around 3 am my mother wakes me up.</p>
<p>“You need to get up, I think something is seriously wrong with your dad”. I’m like, “Ah fuck, its 3 am I don’t want to get up”. My mother wanted to call the hospital and get an ambulance to come out, however my father is stubborn and said just drive there.</p>
<p>We get there at around 3:25, and go to the emergency room. Next think I know they are doing x-rays, and telling me that he has a very low chance of living. MY father ended up having over 20 PE’s (pulmonary embulie) in his lungs. If just one popped he would die. (Most people get only 1, and they get it around 65-70, my father is only 40). I am freaking out wondering how the hell this happened.</p>
<p>Happy I went to the hospital, I listen to my ipod while my father sleeps. He was on something called diaden or something. (In pain killers it goes like this, this is least to most. tylonol,tremedyl,vikodin,perkiset,morphine, then this stufd known as diaden.). This is the strongest pain killer out there (Aka, this is legal heroin). Apparently they were trying to explain the pain my dad was in (he had tears in his eyes, mind you, this is a 6’4 300 lbs man). Apparently each of the PE’s felt like being stabbed and then having it turn. I couldn’t even imagine the pain he was in.</p>
<p>Lucky for me, a week later my dad survived, even though just barley. He has been at home recovering for a while now.</p>

<p>Not at all, actually.</p>
<p>Last year, my freshman year, we had to take this kid to a hospital because he got alcohol poisoning. I never got in any trouble (drinking is bad in America <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> ) because my parents thought my friends called me after he was fucked up and to come along to see if he was Ok. I hate American drinkings laws, if it was made legal to those around age 14-15+ then people wouldn’t do that kinda shit.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/reyx7.html">@reyx7</a> Here in Belgium, you are allowed to drink and buy alcohol at the age of 16. But, only if it’s weak drinks, meaning that it has to be lower than 15% alcohol. If you want to buy and drink strong drinks &gt; 15% alcohol, you have to wait until 18 you’re years old.</p>
<p>Here, there are a lot of paki stores and they don’t mind your age when selling alochol. So if you get in trouble when you’re wasted, and you’re 16, but you drank vodka, they can’t do shit to you. Because could have drunk lots of beers to get into the situation you’re in.</p>
<p>Anyway, driving, requires an age of 18. In America it’s 16 right?</p>

        <p>When i was 7 or 8 me and my friend where playing roller hockey with my neighbors ball and i accidentally hit it down the sewer drain. At the time we were scared shiftless because our neighbor had told us specifically not to hit it down the drain, So we had the great idea of lifting it up (Now these things are like 200-300 pounds and i have no idea how we managed to pick it up) so we have the thing in the air and my friend decides to drop it. it landed on my left ring finger and tore it almost completely off of my hand only to be hanging by a sliver of skin. I remember running down the street screaming for my mom. i ended up having to go to three different hospitals because i needed a “specialist”. so then i had to get surgery and have like 7 pins inside of my finger and a cast up to my elbow. then i had to go through about 3 months of therapy.  my top knuckle is fake in that finger and i cant bend it.</p>

        <p>It was the first day of summer vacation, I was playing soccer with some friends, and we threw ourselves on the ground to get a penalty kick,<br>
then I had the ball and wanted to dribble over my friend and my leg just knacked. I never broke anything so the pain was really heavy, I was yelling that we had to go to the hospital that my leg was broken, but my friends were just laughing; thinking that it was fake. Till they saw my feet standing the wrong way. In the hospital they said I broke all my bones in my leg and had to get 2 operations.<br>
I was in plaster for whole the summer vacation.<br>
I will never be able to sport on a high level anymore, all due some stupid soccer</p>
