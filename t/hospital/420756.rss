[size=7]This happend to me, today, and I felt like making a topic about it since I haven&#39;t posted shit in the general discussion category for a while.[/size]

[size=7]After you read my story, feel free to tell me and other people about your hospital stories.[/size]

So today, me and my friend planned to go to a nightclub. We met eachother in Antwerp city at around 11 PM and 10 minutes later, a girl and a guy arrived aswell. They were also coming with us. But we were not complete yet. There were 2 more guys that were suppose to come with us.
They told us they would arrive in about a half hour. So we planned to get some drinks before going to the club while waiting on those 2 guys.


We bought a big bottle of whisky from the local pakistan store. My friend and I were not first time drinkers, we have drunk before: whisky, vodka,...
And since we never actually got drunk from drinking a lot of those strong drinks, we thought, let&#39;s fuck this whyisky up.


So we went to the park (my friend, I, the girl and the guy) and started drinking that fucking whisky from the bottle. I had not eaten anything that day. 


I drank 50% of that bottle, my friend and the others drank the other 50% together. I remember the first 30 minutes after I took my last gulp from the damn whisky. The first 5 minutes my world started to turn around like fuck, I was like, I know I&#39;m drunk, and I&#39;m trying to be normal, but my fucking head is spinning like fuck. So I was pretty sober. 10 minutes later, I had trouble talking, I was thinking perfect, like I am now, but I just couldn&#39;t talk. And finally another 10 minutes, my legs shut off and I couldn&#39;t walk anymore. That&#39;s all I remember. Then I woke up at 5 AM in the hospital.


Noone was there and I was fucked. I was sober again but had to puke a couple of times. Then I called one of the doctors, asked him when, who and how I was brought here. He told me my dad visited me 2 hours ago, so I was pretty much fucked and that they took me in from the ambulance. He also was suprised I spoke perfect Dutch.


I couldn&#39;t do anything at that time so I decided to get some sleep. And I did, then at 8 AM my dad came, took me home, was a little mad, not so much because this was the first time I got into a drunk hospital situation.


Anyhow, after I got some sleep home, my friend came over and told me what happend.
Basicly after those 30 minutes he told me that I was wasted, puking, falling asleep, and not able to use my legs. So he told those 2 (guy and girl) to go to Bredabaan and wait there, until he got back after carrying me home. He planned to go to that club without me but with those 2.


The problem was, those 2 were also wasted, not so much as I was, but they were unable to think and talk normal.


My friend carried me in the metro, and some guy came with 2 other large built guys telling my friend to get the fuck away, that he was a doctor and that he would fix me.


One of that doctors friends pushed my friend telling him to get the fuck away, after my friend told him to leave him and me the fuck alone and mind their own business. My friend is only 5.4 ft like me, but unlike me, he was sober, he is a MMA and wrestling club champion, he has trained MMA and wrestling his whole life and has a LOT of muscle (all from doing pushups and situps his whole life, no fitness boolshit). 


So he knocked those guys out, and that doctor took a run for it. Anyhow, after exiting the metero and finally arriving in my street, some fucking Belgians saw us and called an ambulance. And that&#39;s when they took me to the hospital.


He also called those other 2 (the guy and the girl) telling them that he was going home and that they should also go home.
They were still waiting on my friend at 2 AM on Bredabaan and since there were no busses at that hour to that club wich was 40 KM away from them, they called a taxi.
Unlike in America, taxis in belgium cost 40 dollars. So they spent all their money on that taxi, and when they arrived at the club, they had no more money to pay for tickets.


So, that&#39;s that, also, appreantly, I spoke Armenian to all those doctors when I was brought in so they were suprised when I started speaking Dutch. They asked my dad how come a 17 year old dude living most of his life in Belgium doesn&#39;t speak the language.


Also, my dad told me that because we drank from the whisky bottle itself, a lot of spirt fumes got in our bodies, that normally should not have gone in our bodies (when you drink from a glass) and that that was the main reason why I was wasted.

<p>Dealer was selling it laced. The doctor told him he had a PCP addiction and that had caused permanent damage to the brain, and he could think was “lol wut”. He’s been smoking for years though, it wasn’t new, he was just getting it from a different guy.</p>

              <p>Few years back I got appendicitis. It then developed into peritonitis. Needed emergency surgery since it’s life threatening, and all anesthetic drugs were stolen by a nurse. So I had to wait until the next day. I had to share a room with a guy on laxatives so the worst part was, they were pumping a litre of IV and several bags of antibiotics into me every hour, so I had to pee every 10 minutes. But the guy was in there shitting himself the whole time. After surgery my incisions got infected and very painful also, and even 12 morphine shots a day did nothing for the pain.</p>
<p>worst 3 days of my life. I got to miss school for a week after though. And thankfully I live in a country with free healthcare, so I won’t be working the rest of my life to pay off the surgery costs.</p>

<p>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a medical condition where a portion of the bowel dies. It typically occurs in newborns that are either premature or otherwise unwell. Symptoms may include poor feeding, bloating, decreased activity, blood in the stool, or vomiting of bile. The exact cause is unclear.

<p>They said it was probable I wasn’t going to make it. I survived, obviously and now live with multiple scars on my stomach. I have one scar that is about 7-8 inches long and then about 4 scars about 2 inches long where they inserted tubes and such.  I also received the sacrament anointing of the sick, which I was always proud of because I always had received one more sacrament than everyone else. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>My sister was born at 5 months pregnant. The doctors said she would be blind, deaf, dumb, have autism, and not be able to walk. They also said she would die within 2 weeks.</p>
<p>After 2 weeks had passed they said she would live to be 1 month old.</p>
<p>After 1 month had passed, they said she would live to be 6 months old, max.</p>
<p>After a half of a year had passed they said she might live to be 2 years old.</p>
<p>She is now 14 years old, and can see, talk, hear, and walk. She is like any other normal child and you would never be able to tell that when she was born she could fit in the palm of your hand. They even had to custom make a pacifier from a mold of her thumb.</p>

I never broke anything so the pain was really heavy, I was yelling that we had to go to the hospital that my leg was broken, but my friends were just laughing; thinking that it was fake. Till they saw my feet standing the wrong way. In the hospital they said I broke all my bones in my leg and had to get 2 operations.<br>
I was in plaster for whole the summer vacation.<br>
