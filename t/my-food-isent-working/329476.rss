          <blockquote>
              <p>for food, go to potions.java (if you’re using delta) and add this:</p>
<p><code>			case 4049: // food ID
				if (System.currentTimeMillis() - c.foodDelay &lt; 2000) // time to make it so you can't spam eating food
				return;
				c.foodDelay = System.currentTimeMillis();	
				if(c.currentHealth &lt;= 0) {
				break;
				}
				c.currentHealth += 10;//adds 10 hp
				if (c.currentHealth &gt; c.playerLevel[c.playerHitpoints])//means that if it heals for over your current hit points level, it resets it back
					c.currentHealth = c.playerLevel[c.playerHitpoints];//continuation to above line of code
				c.sendQuest("" + c.currentHealth + "", 4016);//idk what this does tbh.
				c.deleteItem(4049, slot, 1);//delete's the Item from your inventory
				break;</code></p>
<p>oh and for donator items go to client.java and look for your welcome message.</p>
<p>ex: if the welcome message says “welcome to pvpscape!”<br>
you will search for <code>welcome to pvpscape!</code> in your client.java using ctrl+f<br>
then add this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">donator = 1</code></pre>
<p>note: this makes it so everybody is a donator… if you want, you can make it so non-donators are actualyl donators so you can actually have donator status.</p>
<p>EDIT: some girl added my MSN then told me to go to this website to see her naked and she told me it was free, the she said that of course since viewing porn is for 18+ i have to sign up with my credit card. how stupid am i supposed to be to fall for that lol</p>
