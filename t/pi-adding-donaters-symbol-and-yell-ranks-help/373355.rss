    <description>Hello,

Im trying to add a rank for donaters so when they talk it shows $ symbol next to their name? 
how would i do this on me project insanity base?

also i added a yell rank for donaters but it does not show its seems that player rank goes over it?
as well as that
i have made a rank for my gfx artist but it also allows her to do all commands including owners,
this is my yell code 
[code]
            if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;yell&quot;)) {
                    String rank = &quot;&quot;;
                    String Message = playerCommand.substring(4).toLowerCase();
		if (c.memberStatus &gt;= 2) {
                    rank = &quot;@gre@[$Donator] &quot;+ c.playerName +&quot;: &quot;;
                }
                if (c.playerRights &gt;= 0) {
                    rank = &quot;[Player] &quot;+ c.playerName +&quot;:&quot;;
                }
                if (c.playerRights &gt;= 1) {
                    rank = &quot;@sil@[Moderator] &quot;+ c.playerName +&quot;:&quot;;
                }
                if (c.playerRights &gt;= 2) {
                    rank = &quot;@gol@[Admin] &quot;+ c.playerName +&quot;:&quot;;
                }
                if (c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {
                    rank = &quot;@red@[Owner] &quot;+ c.playerName +&quot;: &quot;;
                }
                if (c.playerRights &gt;= 5) {
                    rank = &quot;@sil@[gfx artist] &quot;+ c.playerName +&quot;:&quot;;

<p>Basically, instead of basing it off just a int value for the player, you always make sure that the player has the rights of 0, ex: normal player (in this case).</p>
<p>Reason why your Gfx Person can do all the owner commands;<br>
Her player rights are</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">c.playerRights = 5</code></pre>
<p>Your commands are most likely set if the player rights are &gt;= 3 or 2, basically in this case, if you only have one gfx artist i would do the yell command for the username, and not the rights,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(player.getUsername().equals("namehere")) {</code></pre>
<p>Not sure on the get method of username for PI, but iâ€™m sure you can figure it out <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
