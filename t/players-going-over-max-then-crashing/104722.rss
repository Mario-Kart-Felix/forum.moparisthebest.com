    <title>Players going over max then crashing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/players-going-over-max-then-crashing/104722</link>
    <description>Sometimes when someone pks someone else I get this error:
[code]Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 24  //24 players? the max is 20...
        at client.PKz(client.java:21206) //and the error is returned from the players[killerID] array element
        at client.ApplyDead(client.java:21328) // vv everything below is clean, just activates pkz()
        at client.ApplyDead(client.java:21318)
        at client.process(client.java:15343)
        at PlayerHandler.process(PlayerHandler.java:137)
        at server.main(server.java:56)[/code]

Now it looks like more than the maximum players are getting on my server, but the only thing that returns an outofboundsexception is this.  A lot of other player processing junk that must be outofbounds also is not giving me any errors.  I&#39;m comepletely stumped.  Any ideas?

P.S. My server base is Ultimate PK, which is buggy and gave me errors from the start, but I fixed them all except this one.

Edit: And oh, it crashes server also.  My autorebooter-crash-detector picks it up, but it still increases downtime.</description>
