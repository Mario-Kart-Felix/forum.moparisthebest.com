    <description>anyone know how to use the natural logarithm function (also called ln) in java? i need to use this function to complete an equation and it would be nice if someone could tell me how its done....</description>

              <p>[quote=“xxl3th4lxx, post:2, topic:157503”]the natural logarithm of a number x is the power to which e would have to be raised to equal x — for example the natural log of e itself is 1 because e1 = e, while the natural logarithm of 1 would be 0, since e0 = 1. The natural logarithm can be defined for all positive real numbers x as the area under the curve y = 1/t from 1 to x, and can also be defined for non-zero complex numbers</p>
<p>The natural logarithm function can also be defined as the inverse function of the exponential function, leading to the identities:</p>
<pre><code>e^ln(x) = x     if x &gt; 0

ln(e^x) = x
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, the logarithm function is a bijection from the set of positive real numbers to the set of all real numbers. More precisely it is an isomorphism from the group of positive real numbers under multiplication to the group of real numbers under addition.</p>
<p>Logarithms can be defined to any positive base other than 1, not just e, and are useful for solving equations in which the unknown appears as the exponent of some other quantity.[/quote]</p>
<p>yes i know what the natural logarithm function is… my problem is you cant use it in java as far as i know…</p>
