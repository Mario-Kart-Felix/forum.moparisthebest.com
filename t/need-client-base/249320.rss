    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-client-base/249320</link>
    <description>Okay i am looking for a client base for my server wich is richscape. I want one that would not be to hard to hack the cache (i want to delete some global objects without using deleteglobalobject() command thing (for example if i wish to re build varrok). I want it to just be a base with pretty clean code. O yea and it would be nice if it had that a jframe drop down menu at the top (filebar) that i can edit and use. Thanks</description>
