    <description>Ok, I would add this myself but I can&#39;t find the files with the golden admin crown.. Heres what I want to do. I want to edit the look on crowns, just for playerrights=3, (owner) and leave 2 the same old gold crown. Now what i want to do with the owner&#39;s crown is change it to look more attractive and notticable, like this ~~

Does anybody know how to do it? I&#39;ve never seen it on a server but I know it&#39;s possible... coders finding out how to do it would be greatly appreciated^.^
If anyone knows, can you tell me how and where i put in my picture? thanks :D[br][size=1]Posted on: May 06, 2007, 08:02:15 PM[/size][hr]Oh yea, and Killfrog I don&#39;t care for your comments.

              <p>He’s right, its client side. Very easy to do. You just edit your sprites with the crowns in them.</p>
