This server is a project insanity based server. Very well the server is going to be Pvp/skilling based. There will be seperate area&#39;s for both types of people, and a ecomomy of &quot;special&quot; items, which can be gained via pvp/skilling.[/center]




Updates to be done:
Enchanting weapons
Special &quot;spells&quot;
Item set&#39;s which give certain bounuses
and several other ideas

Things that are finished!
Skills
Construction
 works in a unique way, of building your own house which can provide more exp for other skills

Woodcutting
All tree&#39;s work, with axe speeds correct.
Bird nest drops with rare chance of good items

Fishing 
100% with casket&#39;s

Theiving
Works 100%

Prayer
 100% working/ more experience when using Home-Constructed glided alters





MORE TO COME

If you want to hear more or be part of a supporting team, just post your skype.
