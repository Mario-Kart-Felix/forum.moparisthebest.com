Alright guys,

Quite visibly the activity of the forum has declined since these previous projects and we are left with a much smaller userbase (most of which have invested too much time to leave :)).

I&#39;m wondering if you would be interested in giving this project one more chance. The process in setting up the notebook would be similar to that of the first two, but I&#39;m creating this thread to ask for feedback/opinions on anything that could be improved. Most of the members that are frequently visiting this forum now can be trusted.

If this shows some interest I&#39;ll start working on a third thread. Please leave some feedback for me.

This is really not a difficult project. Ship it with tracking within the week you receive it and post a picture of the receipt.</description>

              <p>I don’t really have a preference on the physical copy, that’s up to you guys. It is just as easy to print physical copies as it is to upload a PDF most likely, but more expensive of course. I believe the greater intention of the physical copy was to make the less trustworthy members have a reason to send it and receive a copy of the completed notebook.</p>
<p>I think that putting the less trustworthy members at the beginning (and being very selective in the participant process) and having the shipping deposit is good enough, but I am still completely open to feedback.</p>
<p>A “digital notebook” is not an option for this project and has no reason to be discussed further, the notebook will remain physical.</p>

Yes but the only way to get a physical copy with the same “memories” as the original would have, we would have to count how many people are in the project and buy that many notebooks… Then ship all of those around the world to each person.<br>
That’d be like 10+ books that everyone would have to sign…</p>
<p>And when I said deposit for the physical copy, I meant a payment, not so much a deposit that is returned.</p>

              <p>Just make everybody draw on their own A4 or A5 paper and post scanned copies. We can have a thread dedicated to showcasing the work furthermore it is fairly easy to compile it into a book format that anybody can print out if they want a hard copy [size=4pt](or mitb can sell books to make money for the offical server:D).<br>
[/size]<br>
No money, no personal information. Don’t need to worry about the courier losing the notebook either. This method is better then any 1st Class Delivery next day service bs too!</p>

Do people actually want/need a physical copy of the notebook?  Why not just scan it all to a PDF and put it up for download, if you <em>want</em> a physical copy, print it out yourself?</p>
<p>I have a scanner so I could do that part, but I’m sure plenty others do as well?</p>
<p>As far as an escrow account of sorts goes, if everyone deposits X, then what?  I guess we could buy and email pre-paid shipping labels to everyone, but it still doesn’t prevent anyone from ‘stealing’ it.<br>

The point of sending a deposit is that you only get it back if you actually send the notebook, not primarily to distribute the shipping costs.[/quote]</p>
<p>It <em>could</em> work, in that case I propose this:</p>
<p>I’ll give each person who wants to participate a unique bitcoin address to send X to (amount to be decided), and they give me an address at which to refund the amount.  Then sending and refunding is easy!</p>
