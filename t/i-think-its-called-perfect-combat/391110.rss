    <description>First of all im shaymin.

i forget my account my password so i made this one.

My Server Base : Combattscape

Problem: When you in pk and try to attack someone he get close to him but he take 1-2 seconds to attack.

Fix The Problem: I Saw in other pravite servers that i play..that when attack someone you get close to him and immdeitly attack.

Any Toutrials for help?

NOTE: if someone didnt understand i can upload a video that explain.

Thanks :)</description>

              <p>I’m guessing this is delta based?</p>
<p>People have said to have fixed this against other players in PvP, but not against NPC’s How they did it, I’m not quite sure.</p>
<p>I believe the 1-2 second delay is caused by the process() method which isn’t very well coded.</p>
