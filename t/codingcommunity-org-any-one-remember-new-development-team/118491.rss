    <description>Hi Everyone? Does any one remember codingcommunity.org? It was a website about coding in 2005. I bought the domain yesturday thinking we could be popular again. 

If anyone would like to help me with the production &amp; re-make of it, Please post here or PM me. You will recieve your very own email address. I am also offering free sub-domains for people who want them..

(you.codingcommunity.org)

You will get cpanel Access, mysql databases, emails and more!

So, please join the re-build of codingcommunity.org
