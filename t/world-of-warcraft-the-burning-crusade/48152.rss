    <description>well as you all probably know the new world of warcraft burning crusade is out.
it was released 16/1/2007 at 12:00am the dark portal wich leeds to the new content has now opened and shopes world wide are trying to keep up with the sales of this expansion that has taken 3 years (i think) blizzard entertainment* has been planing this expansion since the relice of the new world of warcraft* also in other news blizzard is happy to say that over 5 million players world wide log on to world of warcraft per day
witch is a record for a mmropg blizzard have also said that they are now planning a huge server upgrade because of the mass amount of players and the expansion pack. 
the servers are are going to be very laggy at this time seen as the portal as just opened the huge migrate of players in to the new place called outlands so i would recommend if you have your world of warcraft the burning crusade cd&#39;s you start to install them now and log on and go through asap or if you miss it tonight then i would recommend that you wate either until the 17/1/2007 at 12:00am or the 18/1/2007 12:00am any time after that is ok i just would recommend you wate for the 12:00am server reboot wich would make it less laggy and actualy possible to get through 

if you have any comments on the new wow then please post them here seens as im not yet a good enough level to enter..=[ oh well have fun

several years have passed since the Burning Legion&#39;s defeat at Mount Hyjal and the races of Azeroth have continued to rebuild their once shattered lives. With renewed strength, the heroes of the Horde and Alliance have begun to explore new lands and broken through the Dark Portal to investigate the realms beyond the known world. Will these heroes find friends or foes? What dangers and rewards lie in wait beyond the Dark Portal? And what will they do when they discover that the demons they thought vanquished have returned to renew their terrible Burning Crusade?
