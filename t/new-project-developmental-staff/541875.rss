    <description>Developers,

[center]My theory and a example:[/center]

After countless hours and planning of the &quot;perfect&quot; server I started to do a lot of research and almost [i]every[/i] server that I found lacked the ability to have their player base be both &quot;skill&quot; and &quot;pvp/pvm&quot; orientated. An example is almost every server has all the potions besides extremes in their shops for prices of like 300 gold. I personally believe that potions such as prayers/restores and super sets should be earned from [i]drops[/i] or even farmed/herblore. This gives skillers the ability to help out players while at the same time making a little cash in their pocket while skilling instead of just being able to buy all the herbs/seconds from a store and getting the fast 99.

(This is simply an example of my thinking when it comes to the Development of a server.)

[center]A little bit about myself and my status:[/center]

Hello,

I will start off by doing a quick introduction my name is Matt and I live in United States (Illinois) I&#39;m 19 and I do work a full-time job. I first started playing Runescape in 7th grade. Yes this means I have been playing a long time. I retired from Runescape about 3 years ago when I was introduced to runescape private servers. I found my favorite server to be Deltascape and the reason(s) for that was &quot;shit wasn&#39;t handed to you&quot; An example is to get 99 smith and mining you would have to get the ores yourself there was a market for everything including runes/herblore/farming/cooking/fishing. I also mentioned I work a full-time job so [b]I have the required money to take this server all of the way[/b].

[center]The Plan:[/center]

I have not decided of a name for the server as that will be the responsibility of a developer and management meeting.  We will work together on the creating of this server from the Staff(s) point of view with the mind of the community. All decision(s) will be made with discussion from all parties. (No one person taking responsibility for all decisions) We want to make a runescape private server, that is actually worth taking your time and playing instead of buying ingredients from a shop making a item and selling it back. How fun is that?

[center]Is this for you?[/center]

If you believe that the development of this server is for you please leave me some general information:
