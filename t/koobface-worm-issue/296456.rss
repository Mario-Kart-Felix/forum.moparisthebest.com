    <title>Koobface Worm issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/koobface-worm-issue/296456</link>
    <description>Well, the other day my mom was browsing Facebook when she clicked a link that her friend has posted.  Well the link redirected her to a video which required her to download an updated adobe flash player.  Well she attempted to update it, and the &#39;video&#39; downloaded about 10 virus&#39;s one of them being the Koobface virus, which our virus protection didn&#39;t catch because the version downloaded was so new.  So for the past 3 days or so, I have been trying to get this thing off her computer.  It has completely rendered it useless.  I have done everything from removing the process file (freddy58.exe) to downloading and running 4 different virus scanners.  This thing is annoying, and extremely good at hiding.  I&#39;m not sure what else to do, and I can&#39;t find anything else because of 2 things.  First, this thing makes it impossible to search for things by redirecting you to an ad site on everything.  And the second is that my computer is broken (overheating issues).  So I&#39;m posting here hoping that someone has either had experiences with this and removed it, or can search and find something.</description>

I’d recommend getting some sort of anti-virus software and scanning in safe mode. Once it’s found, even if the anti-virus software can’t delete it, you can manually. Also check msconfig.exe.<br>

              <blockquote>Koobface is a worm that recently made headlines as it spread through Facebook and infected the PCs of many unsuspecting members of the popular social networking site. Koobface tricks a person into downloading its installation file, then redirects search engine traffic to a site called find-www.net. Facebook has been working on cleaning out their computer systems, and posted some advice for dealing with a Koobface infection.
<p>Koobface spread through Facebook by using social engineering tricks. Victims see a link that appears to lead to a video of themselves. When the victim clicks the link, they are asked to upgrade their Flash player in order to watch the video. Instead of downloading the Flash player update, the Koobface worm installs itself.</p>
<p>Once Koobface has infected a PC, it hijacks search engine traffic and diverts it to a site called <a href="http://find-www.net" rel="nofollow noopener">find-www.net</a>. If a person with an infected computer tries to do a Google or Yahoo! search, they may end up at this illegitimate search engine instead.</p>
<p>Facebook posted a notice regarding the Koobface worm on their security page. They suggest that a person whose PC has been infected use an up-to-date virus scanner, and then reset their Facebook password. Some of the free online virus scanners suggested are Kaspersky, Symantec, McAfee and Microsoft Live OneCare.</p>

              <p>I once downloaded a ‘flash player’ from a site, i later realised that it was infact not a flash player, and that it was a virus, which literally made it so whatever i type in google, it somehow comes up with some sort of porn site.<br>
Honest, i typed in runescape, and it redirected me from <a href="http://runescape.com">runescape.com</a> to some porn site.<br>
It was pretty sick.</p>
<p>That resulted in restoring my pc to factory settings, thus losing all my data, and everything.</p>

              <p>I suggest you use Malware byte’s anti malware. It can be found at <a href="http://www.download.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.download.com</a><br>
Make sure you update it before you use it.<br>
Also get ZoneAlarm firewall. It has a built in program control feature, which lets you scroll through a list of programs and disable their rights and ect. First DL ZoneAlarm and Disable the program. Then run Malware bytes and scan your computer.</p>

              <p>Well, the other day my mom was browsing Facebook when she clicked a link that her friend has posted.  Well the link redirected her to a video which required her to download an updated adobe flash player.  Well she attempted to update it, and the ‘video’ downloaded about 10 virus’s one of them being the Koobface virus, which our virus protection didn’t catch because the version downloaded was so new.  So for the past 3 days or so, I have been trying to get this thing off her computer.  It has completely rendered it useless.  I have done everything from removing the process file (freddy58.exe) to downloading and running 4 different virus scanners.  This thing is annoying, and extremely good at hiding.  I’m not sure what else to do, and I can’t find anything else because of 2 things.  First, this thing makes it impossible to search for things by redirecting you to an ad site on everything.  And the second is that my computer is broken (overheating issues).  So I’m posting here hoping that someone has either had experiences with this and removed it, or can search and find something.</p>
