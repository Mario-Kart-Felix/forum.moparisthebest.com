<p>Well of course, this is linux we’re talking about.</p>
<p>Anyways, I personally think Ubuntu is the best distribution. I like the fact that if i need something, i can go to a command line and type “apt-get install something” instead of looking all over the internet for it.</p>
<p>I used to use Redhat until it became enterprise, and it was the most annoying thing i had ever used. After that i used Fedora, and it’s the same thing. Then I heard about Ubuntu. I tried it and have been using it ever since. One thing about ubuntu that is cool, is the fact that you can install all the other variations and have them all at once.</p>
<p>Also, I only use DamnSmallLinux when I’m at someone else’s house.</p>

I’ve always wanted to try Gentoo, yet it never seems to successfully install on my computer.</p>
<p>Anyways, I too started on Ubuntu.  The main reason I made the switch from Windows was just to try something new.  Ubuntu stuck, and I used it for about 6 months.  Next, I decided that I wanted something new again.  Ubuntu worked fine, but it was a little on the slow side.  That may have just been me, though.  So, I browsed around, tried a few different distributions.  I really didn’t like any of them until I tried Arch Linux.  Arch is developed under KISS philosophy.  None of those fancy GUIs to do everything for you, for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<p>I do think that Ubuntu is a great Linux distro, though.  I just felt that it didn’t really fit my needs.</p>

<p>I still believe that *ubuntu (personally I use kubuntu) is one of the best linux distributions out there, and it is what I use on all computers I have access to.

<p>Well, from what I can tell, *ubuntu is based on Debian, updated a bit more and Debian it’s self is used in servers, very stable, however, it seems the slogan “linux for humans” has maybe degraded it’s self a bit attracting the noobs, however the whole *ubuntu community is VERY helpful, even when it isn’t about *ubuntu!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah they are very helpful! Everytime I have had a problem, they have always come through either in a post or in a personal message on the forums. They are very kind and very friendly toward new people trying Linux.</p>
<p>I agree to that Ubuntu is very stable. I have noticed very few bugs, and the ones that I have noticed and submitted were promptly fixed in the next update.</p>
<p>I don’t see how someone can find fault with anything without trying it first. This whole topic is based on a retarded statement. I’m not trying to initiate a ‘flame war’ just pointing out a prominent fact.</p>
<p>I have also tried my share of Operating Systems. I have tried Solaris, *buntu, SUSE, Slackware, and a few other Live CDs of Linux OSs. Like mwiebelhaus was saying, I have always ended up back on Ubuntu because they make it so easy to use, configure, and modify to my liking.</p>
