    <title>Help with connection problems?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-connection-problems/410473</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a fairly new coder so this probably will seem a bit of a noobish question...

I&#39;ve coded a 317 using the nividia server and client. I&#39;m pretty much done coding, so i sent my friend the client files so he could help me test. He can never connect, i&#39;ve changed ip in my client.java and updated the java version. But as I said im a new coder and know nothing past that. Could anyone tell me step by step what i should do so he can connect?</description>

              <p>you have to have it portforwarded, or you and your friend both need hamachi. and for him to connect to you, you need your non-local ip address, if you look in the bottom right of one of your posts it tells you what that ip is. and if you are using hamachi, the ip address in that is what they will need to use, so they need a client that they can type the ip address into to connect.</p>
