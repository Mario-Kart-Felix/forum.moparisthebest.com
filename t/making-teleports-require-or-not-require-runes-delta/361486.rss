    <title>Making Teleports Require or not Require runes.[Delta]</title>

    <description>[Delta] This is only for Delta bases or atleast I have not tested on any others.

Ok I&#39;m gona try to make this pretty easy to understand.

in Clickingmost.java is where your gona be editing everything.

find this

[code]case 51039:[/code]
thats a teleport in the ancient spellbook. find the case id of the teleport you want to use, the easiest way of doing this is by simply searching the coords the teleport takes you to when you click it (again all of this is in clickingmost.java) If you dont know how to do that then click the teleport and then once your teleported type ::mypos and search the coords in clickingmost.java.

It should be 2 sets of numbers the first being the x coordinate and the second being the Y coordinate.

ok Now once you have found your teleport right under case XXXX(the XXXX being w/e your case number is, ps. the case number is also the buttin ID of the spell, this is called a switch statement, but thats for another tutorial). Ok! Moving on.

now add this right under case XXXX:

[code]if (c.playerHasItem(555, 2)) {[/code]


Now the 555 is the ID of the rune and the 2 is how much of that rune you need. Now you can add 20 of these if you wanted just change the 555 to all the different runes you want it to require.


Now after every if statement, that being everyone of the things

[code]if (c.playerHasItem(555, 2)) {[/code]
just add that it takes away those runes like this

[code]c.deleteItem(555, 2);[/code]

make sure you add the same ammount of



Ok and finally at the end of the entire case XXXX: right before another case starts up for every bracket you opened meaning every 

[code]if (c.playerHasItem(555, 2)) {[/code]

add this

}else
	c.sM(&quot;You don&#39;t have enough runes to teleport.&quot;);

so now an example of a completed case,

[code]case 51039:
if (c.playerHasItem(555, 2)) {
c.deleteItem(555, 2);
c.addSkillXP(10000, 6);
c.setAnimation(2588);
}else
	c.sM(&quot;You don&#39;t have enough runes to teleport&quot;);
break;[/code]

Now notice these two extra statements

[code]c.addSkillXP(10000, 6);
c.setAnimation(2588);[/code]

the c.addskillXP(20000, 6); sais , Ok if you do this teleport you get 10k mage xp
and the c.setAnimation(2588);
is just the animation ure char does when he teleports, I just threw that in there chances r you wont need to add that if its already a teleport.

------------

Now Just takeout and add in whatever you don&#39;t need/want in your teleports. TBH, just delete the

c.deleteItem(XXXX, XX); if you want spells to require nothing to teleports</description>
