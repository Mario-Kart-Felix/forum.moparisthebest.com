<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_programming_language" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Object Pascal</a></h3>

<p>Object Pascal refers to a branch of object-oriented derivatives of Pascal, mostly known as the primary programming language of Delphi.   Object Pascal is an extension of the Pascal language that was developed at Apple Computer by a team led by Larry Tesler in consultation with Niklaus Wirth, the inventor of Pascal. It is descended from an earlier object-oriented version of Pascal called Clascal, which was available on the Lisa computer.</p>

It’s an old dead language that nobody uses that has a cool ass badge on here that also nobody has.</p>
<p>The reason DatMaker was made in Delphi was because the first model loading program for runescape models was written in Delphi. DatMaker is open source for that same reason. MrP basically just added the functionality of changing .mqo to .dat and vice versa.[/quote]</p>
<p>so do you know delphi? since your working on that new program right?</p>

Probably not. Mr Potatohead wrote it, and the staff accidentally deleted his account and never restored it so he won’t return here again.<br>
[/quote]accident? what? lmfao…<br>
[/quote]I don’t know, one of the staff members was deleting accounts for whatever reason and some how his got mixed in the group. I made several attempts to try to restore his account (asking the admins) but typically just got pushed under the carpet along with the other 99 problems here.<br>

He left because some members were assholes. SWAT iirc and SWAT isn’t even on this site anymore. He tried helping but nobody really appreciated it so he just left. No idea what he does now. Only person I know that still had contact with him hasn’t spoken to him in like 2+ years.</p>

<p>A file contains bytes which are just 1’s and 0’s in the binary number system. A hex editor converts these to the hexadecimal number system so you edit them more easily and see the values better.<br>

<p>In mathematics and computing, hexadecimal (also base 16, or hex) is a positional numeral system with a radix, or base, of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or alternatively a, b, c, d, e, f) to represent values ten to fifteen.

So you open the file and look for where it reads for the texture to be loaded. An easier alternative is to just follow the model reading class in the client so you can spot it yourself then just follow which bits have been read until you get to the texture part. From then on it’s just changing the values in the file so it loads a texture onto the triangles on the model. You may have to change the material to be a texture but it has been a while and since the site is down I can’t tell you for sure without looking into the code in the client myself.</p>

<p>People have only been able to use textures in the cache. If you could pack the textures into the cache then you could. The main problem is there’s no easy way to do it and requires you to use a hex editor just to add textures in. The site that used to show how is down.</p>

<p>I found (supposebly) code for texture support for DatMaker written by MrP, but all it did was load it. Couldn’t convert it. For that you would need to have a directory to your cache and be able to pack your textures in. Can only be 128x128 pixels iirc, too.</p>

Uses lwjgl. I might finish it up during the summer since I’ll have more time.[/quote][quote=“amy_webb, post:7, topic:519038”]Would be good if you could finish it off, maybe allow it to add textures and proper animations. :P[/quote]</p>
<p>i thought rs (like 317’s) couldnt use textures? or you mean to use the textures for other work.</p>

Probably not. Mr Potatohead wrote it, and the staff accidentally deleted his account and never restored it so he won’t return here again.<br>
[/quote]accident? what? lmfao…[/quote]I don’t know, one of the staff members was deleting accounts for whatever reason and some how his got mixed in the group. I made several attempts to try to restore his account (asking the admins) but typically just got pushed under the carpet along with the other 99 problems here.</p>
