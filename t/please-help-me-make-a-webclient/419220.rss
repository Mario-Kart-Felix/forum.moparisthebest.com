    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-help-me-make-a-webclient/419220</link>
    <description>I have a Demnthium 639 server and client, but the thing is no one will join a server without a webclient, Its just common sense so what I really need is someone to help me out with making one, I will appreciate it very much, No reward seeing that I am broke but uhmm, I guess I can give you any items you like on the server.</description>
