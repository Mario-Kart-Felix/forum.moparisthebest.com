    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-server/408582</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m in need of some cash atm soo... I&#39;m looking for a good source to use for my server. I want a source with none of that 602 animation shit.. I want it to be an original 317.. I don&#39;t care if it has some customs like spirit shields, chaotics, claws, ect. I&#39;m probably going to add those anyways. I have about 50$ to spend on the server.. I am going to buy a domain, vps, and playershare. If I need anything else please tell me. So I&#39;m really just looking for a good source.. I don&#39;t know much with Java or else I would just use a blank source but I want one that has the combat and skills and all that done. So if any of you know a good one, please tell me!</description>

<p>Delta is a good source to start with if you’re a beginner coder. I’d suggest trying that source and client just to mess around with it so you can get familiar with Java. Try changing commands, moving Home, adding item models, editing shops, etc. Once you get better, then start with working on a Project Insanity source.</p>

<p>I have had a server before bro, I know how to do all this… I’ve been working with Java for around 2 years now so yeah… I’m not dumb.</p>
