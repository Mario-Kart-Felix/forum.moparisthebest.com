    <title>Would this be a good update to my server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-this-be-a-good-update-to-my-server/376317</link>
    <description>Alright so the main question is: [size=12pt]Would this be a Good Update to my server?[/size] My name is Questmaster 2k10, and I currently run a 508 server. I was planning to add a special content-update for the first update of the New Year. This update is more of a skill-related feature that would require certain levels to be achieved.

I have a very Accurate Event Manager that keeps track of time very smooth-like. The Update I was planning to add is an [b]Agility-Related Update for the Player&#39;s Run Energy System[/b], which if the player has a certain Agility-level, the amount of run energy left in the bar would decrease 2x slower, making a player&#39;s stamina last much longer. 

The Decreased Amount of Run Energy in the bar will be based on [b]3-Divisions[/b] of timing.

[list][b]Divisions[/b]:

[ul][li]1. At Agility level 30, the amount of run energy will be decreased 2x slower.[/li]

[li]2. At Agility level 60, the amount of run energy will be decreased 3x slower.[/li]

[li]3. At Agility level 90, the amount of run energy will be decreased 4x slower.[/li]

[li]4. If a player takes an Agility Potion (4), and some other agility substances that increases your Agilitie&#39;s Level temporarily,
the amount of run energy will be decreased 5x slower, as a Christmas/New Year gift, and even though the agility level is only temporary through potions, the decrease rate will be permanet! [/li][/ul]

[hr]

[b]I wanted the people of moparscape&#39;s opinions on weather I should add this update?[/b] I&#39;m compatible to add it myself so I won&#39;t need any assistance but I wanted your ideas on wheather this would be a good update. I have 200 players daily, and I don&#39;t want to add something i&#39;ll regret that&#39;ll effect the entire server.

[b][i]The first person to post something positive about this thread will be repped++[/b]</description>

<p>I don’t think I will, for almost 4 years now i’ve been running the same server, and ever since the start all content of/relating to the server has NEVER been released.</p>

              <p>Why not just add their current agility level onto the run energy?<br>
Example<br>
Lvl 1 agility = 100% run<br>
Lvl 2 agility = 102% run (initial jump)<br>
Lvl 3 agility = 103 % run<br>
Lvl 50 agility = 150% run<br>
Lvl 99 agility + agility cape on = 200% run energy</p>
