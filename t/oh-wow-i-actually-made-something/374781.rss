    <title>Oh wow, I actually made something</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/oh-wow-i-actually-made-something/374781</link>
    <description>God, after a few months of nearly nothing, I made THIS! :D

[img]http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/2844/renderjy.png[/img]

(keep in mind I still keep my models  poly-efficient for servers &lt;.&lt;)

Its not all too great, but I&#39;m using a new method of modeling that I may share soon, and considering how I&#39;m making it, its working very well. If anyone really wants a release, PM me or post for it and I&#39;ll ad a DL.

Here&#39;s a weild view for anyone interested:

<p>I do like the blade and I’m curious if you are using a high specular for the red but I’m a little curious about the part where the handle connects with the blade itself. Definitely better than what I can do! :D[/quote]<br>
It’s when the polygons are low but still look nice.</p>

<p>In anycase, I like the handle, but the blade is way to short, and the shape doesn’t match the handle. For that type of a handle you need a much studier looking blade</p>

very nice, the blade could be bigger and im not a fan of the hilt, but overall the design is really quite interesting. Maybe something that could go along with an armor set?<br>
[/quote]Never thought of that ._. I’m not great with armor, but I could make a set similar to my Thunder set.</p>
<p>Oh and, what hilt? :3 Its just how it looks in the sketch I drew, which is part of my method.[/quote]<br>
hmm, well what i meant was the handle, it looked like the circular part was a some sort of hilt design, idk my monitor sucks.</p>
<p>and the handle should be split just for the sake of it if you were ever to release it.</p>
