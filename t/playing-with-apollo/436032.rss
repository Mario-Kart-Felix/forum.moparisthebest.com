    <title>Playing With Apollo</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/playing-with-apollo/436032</link>
    <description>[center][b]Introduction:[/b][/center]
Woah! It&#39;s time for another project, going to fuck around with an Apollo source. I&#39;m going to try to have fun with this although I don&#39;t really have any fun programming RuneScape private servers anymore. Either way, I&#39;ll give it a go. This project won&#39;t be released, basically just for showoff. Something good to follow and not a shitty Project Insanity loading 903 graphics lol. So, yeah, some fun [hopefully] little project for you to just follow. Again, not going to be releasing this because I don&#39;t want my hard work getting tossed to leechers and shit like that.

[center][b]About The Project:[/b][/center]
Basically, like said in the introduction, just going to be messing around with an Apollo source since I haven&#39;t really used it. It&#39;s actually an easier source to work off of than I thought it was going to be for the two to four times I&#39;ve used it. Though, I need to let you guys know I&#39;m still working with RuneScape private servers since I haven&#39;t really done much with them recently. That&#39;s basically the only reason I&#39;m opening this project in the first place.

So, to show you that I&#39;m still working with them, I&#39;m doing this. Messing around on an Apollo. An actual good project to follow [besides Sini&#39;s RuneTekk project]. I hope you guys understand why I&#39;m not releasing this, you know. I really hate pitching in a ton of my time for it to get thrown away by leechers. You may be thinking, &quot;Why don&#39;t you do it to help the RSPS community?&quot; I don&#39;t really care for how good or bad it gets at this point. It&#39;s not that fun to develop and the community itself lacks [i]need-to-know[/i] information about Java. That&#39;s why.
[hr]
Before I get started, I must ask; should I use a client loading 194 or just stick with the whatever client?</description>

<p>I am talking about “good” dungeoneering as well. Participating in the dungeoneering skill on runescape one can easily realize how the system works, its obvious, not a dumbfound conclusion as you claim. I took your advice, as I never have taken a look at a dungeoneering “base” (the public ones), now I realize how shitty this side of mopar is, how horrific.</p>
<p>In no where did I as you say “criticize”  or try to make graham look dumb, your second statement is flawed, same as your third.</p>

How hard is it to create temporary objects with random (but within the players stat range) requirements.[/quote]We’re talking about <span class="bbcode-b">good</span> dungeoneering. Not what you may perceive a good dungeoneering base as. If you really believe the dungeoneering will be as simple as that, you are foolishly mistaken. Especially with the Apollo base. You should look more into dungeoneering along with the Apollo base before sliding yourself into dumbfound conclusions. Again, the dungeoneering base is much more difficult than a “temporary objects with random requirements.” Try looking into, and criticizing, something you actually know about.</p>
<p>Also, Graham obviously has a far higher range of intelligence about the Java language than you [as do I]. So, whilst you’re criticizing Graham and other skilled programmers; we just laugh at your foolish comments. You trying to correct _Rix is like Mike Tyson fighting a first grader. You trying to make Graham sound dumb is like sicking a dragon on a rooster.</p>
<p>I can’t wrap my mind around the fact you assume you could possibly even have a chance at targeting <span class="bbcode-b">real</span> programmers. If you don’t have anything with any intellectual value to post here that isn’t just what you believe, please don’t post here at all.</p>

              <p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Introduction:</span>[/center]<br>
Woah! It’s time for another project, going to fuck around with an Apollo source. I’m going to try to have fun with this although I don’t really have any fun programming RuneScape private servers anymore. Either way, I’ll give it a go. This project won’t be released, basically just for showoff. Something good to follow and not a shitty Project Insanity loading 903 graphics lol. So, yeah, some fun [hopefully] little project for you to just follow. Again, not going to be releasing this because I don’t want my hard work getting tossed to leechers and shit like that.<br>
[hr]<br>
[center]<span class="bbcode-b">About The Project:</span>[/center]<br>
Basically, like said in the introduction, just going to be messing around with an Apollo source since I haven’t really used it. It’s actually an easier source to work off of than I thought it was going to be for the two to four times I’ve used it. Though, I need to let you guys know I’m still working with RuneScape private servers since I haven’t really done much with them recently. That’s basically the only reason I’m opening this project in the first place.</p>
<p>So, to show you that I’m still working with them, I’m doing this. Messing around on an Apollo. An actual good project to follow [besides Sini’s RuneTekk project]. I hope you guys understand why I’m not releasing this, you know. I really hate pitching in a ton of my time for it to get thrown away by leechers. You may be thinking, “Why don’t you do it to help the RSPS community?” I don’t really care for how good or bad it gets at this point. It’s not that fun to develop and the community itself lacks <span class="bbcode-i">need-to-know</span> information about Java. That’s why.<br>
[hr]<br>
Before I get started, I must ask; should I use a client loading 194 or just stick with the whatever client?</p>
