    <description>Well I can&#39;t run a server yet no guide can help me =[

My old hoster has irl things to do so If you&#39;d like to work with me in making servers and running I&#39;d like a good person that has a non laggy comp. I am a noob coder *new at it* but I&#39;m working on skill cape an othe items in a few servs. Atm I got a pk 1 an a skiller one..

App to be my server hoster for free ( might pay 300k a week|possibly )
[QUOTE]1.Can you run a server?
2.How long could you keep it on? ( I wouldn&#39;t mind if it&#39;s above 5hrs. )
3.Do you have msn?
4.Do you have a server restarter?
5.Have you ever hosted another persons server?who?
[/QUOTE]

Well I got forums, a site its free but i might add paypal to forums and buy a website. 
My server hoster must have 25 - 50+ posts.. 

What I&#39;v added to server and whats source?

Telescape Source - Pimpscape Source
-Skill capes
-Drag boots, torso, defender..
-A skill cape shop (fixin price)

Need to know info----

-I&#39;m paying 200k for 1st week pay 2 days after running server. Tonight if you run it it&#39;s 1 day.
-You can choose to be Co-Owner or a Owner, or w/e you choose....
-You must run server on a 30minute restart-1hour restart .
-You will be gaining rs2 gp faster if you run server 24.7
-You will be payed each Friday after 1st pay, No acceptions (excuse my spelling)
-I will be active on Msn, on my forums, and on Rune-server.. So I&#39;m always easy to find.
-We will be like friends and try our best to help each other out :)
-Thats it, please do help me out :D

Ps: I&#39;ll send you the uploaded server on up uppIT each time I update. And I&#39;ll most likely scan it but if you allow me to just send it and you scan it I&#39;d be very grateful :D

and also if you know I robin i I&#39;m her brother... *sighs* I&#39;m better at coding then her at least lol... :)

Anyway ASK QUESTIONS HERE....

As soon as we talk on msn I&#39;ll send you the serv on uppIT.

~John

( Also If a mod can change my name to J,o,h,n or j o h n, ect.. I&#39;d appriciate it)


Also I have msn, my msn is [email]John_95-07@hotmail.com[/email] I&#39;ll alkways be on most likely.


A vid of the scan on jotti and yes it says Oversized .zip but I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll hurt...

PS: MODS STOP DELETING MY TOPICS IF YOU ARE...

This Is considered &quot; Help &quot; and i deals with rs2 servers because I need a person to run my server Since I am not able.</description>
