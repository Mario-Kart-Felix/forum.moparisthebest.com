    <title>My little story</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-little-story/24420</link>
    <description>Hello, and thank you for wanting to read my story. Well I am still working on it, so be nice :D ideas/fixes are welcome. 
                                                                

                                                                                  [u][b]A Little Walk[/b][/u]

            Once upon a time... There was two kids walking around town. Their names were Ryan and Bryan. While they were walking , both of them noticed a very faint blue light. Ryan asked, &quot;Hey Bryan, do you think we should check that out?&quot; Bryan replies, &quot;Ummm yeah, just to see...&quot; So they started walking over toward the blue light. As they got closer, a noise started coming from no where. They looked at each other... but kept walking forward. As they neared the light, they noticed a small obect. &quot;I wonder what that is&quot; said Bryan. Ryan replied, &quot;I don&#39;t know, lets go find out&quot;

           &quot;Alright!&quot;, said Bryan. So when the boys walked even closer. The object started takeing shape in the boy&#39;s eyes. &quot;OMG!!&quot;, yells 
Ryan. The boy&#39;s gasp in shock. The object appears to be a a gun. As they start stepping backwards, they notice the noise stopped. &quot;Uhhhh&quot;, says Bryan. Ryan yells, &quot;Yikes!!&quot; Now running away, around the corner a guy dressed in black, stops them. &quot;Well hello boys&quot;, the guy says. &quot;UHH, Hi&quot;, reply the boys. &quot;What you doing around here?&quot;, asks the guy. &quot;Um... just takeing a little walk for some excersise.&quot;, Ryan repys. &quot;Well, ok get lost! Before I call the cops&quot;, the guy yells.

             Running away for their lives Ryan and Bryan don&#39;t even want to look back. As they are running Bryan starts thinking, I wonder what that guy was going there. He was also thinking about the gun, and the guy being dressed in black. &quot;Should we go back, or go tell someone?&quot;, asks Ryan. &quot;I think we should just wait for a little while&quot; Bryan replies. So they sit down on the little brick wall, and wait. Waiting might have been a bad idea though.

            While waiting, they hear some foot-steps coming at a quick pace. Nervous, the boys look at each other. &quot;AHHHHH!&quot;, yell the boys. Running once again, search for a place to hide they think they have got away. But did they?  :| Nope, when all of a sudden they look back just to make sure, and they notice the guy. &quot;I wonder if he is running away or trying to find us.&quot;, says Bryan. Ryan replys, &quot;I don&#39;t know but let&#39;s get out of here!&quot; Now near their houses they start to walk. Making sure the guy isn&#39;t following they go inside Bryan&#39;s house. &quot;Woah! That was a close one!&quot;, Ryan screams. &quot;Yeah you got that right&quot;, Bryan says.

            &quot;Let&#39;s watch some television to get our mind off of things.&quot;, Ryan suggests. The boys start to head towards the living room. Walking past the kitchen Bryan notices his mom cutting some peppers for diner. Bryan starts to think, hmmm maybe I should tell my mom. So Bryan goes over to the kitchen, Ryan follows in concern. &quot;Hey mom, what you doing?&quot;, Bryan asks. &quot;Just getting diner ready.&quot;, she replies. &quot;Ohh, that&#39;s cool.&quot;, Bryan says. &quot;Yup!&quot;, she replys. Ryan looks at Bryan thinking, YOU BETTER NOT TELL HER! So now Ryan starts to get worried, but Bryan wasn&#39;t going to tell. He just wanted to see what&#39;s up. &quot;Well we&#39;re going to watch some t.v.&quot;, Bryan says. &quot;Okay, have fun.&quot;, she replies, still getting diner ready.
