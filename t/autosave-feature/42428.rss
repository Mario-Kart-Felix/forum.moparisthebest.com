    <title>AutoSave Feature?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/autosave-feature/42428</link>
    <description>There is no tutorial request forum.. so I&#39;m hoping I posted this in the right spot.

I&#39;m looking for information on how to make a timed event. Autosave preferably, but if you just tell me how to make a timed event I can build in the autosave myself, and I&#39;d appreciate it. It would also be very nice if you could comment out every spot so I know whats what, and can figure it out myself if I need anything else in the future. Thanks very much!</description>
