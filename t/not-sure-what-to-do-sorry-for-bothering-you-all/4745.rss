    <title>Not sure what to do... Sorry for bothering you all</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/not-sure-what-to-do-sorry-for-bothering-you-all/4745</link>
    <description>Hi everyone, I just downloaded moparscape and I&#39;m REALLY looking forward to using it. Anyway, I&#39;ve extracted all the files (Cache, Midi, etc.) into one file on desktop. However, when I click the &quot;Run Moparscape&quot; icon, the black text box comes up, it says error downloading news, which I&#39;ve heard is alright, but then when the client pops up, it says the following.

Sorry, an error has occured while loading Moparscape, to fix try the following in order:

1. Try closing all web browsers and reloading.
2. Try clearing your web browser&#39;s cache from tools- internet options.
3. Try using a different game world (I&#39;m not sure how to do that on MoparScape)
4. Try rebooting your computer.
5. Try selecting a different version of Java from the play game menu. 

Now I&#39;ve done number 1, 2, and 4. I&#39;m just not sure what to do, and any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.
