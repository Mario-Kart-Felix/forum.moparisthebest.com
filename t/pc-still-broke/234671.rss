    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pc-still-broke/234671</link>
    <description>Ok, right board now, i just got my mobo back and my computer was still in the same condition that it was in originally, broke, so the mobo is good, its proc or ram, the more i fuck with it the more i think its ram, 1 stick in top slot, BSoD instantly, other one, windows boots and runs fine, 2 sticks, windows boots but there are lines horizontally across the screen. if it is ram, 1 stick works fine still. If you think its the proc, stop here and tell me please.

If you think it is ram, pwnd-&quot;Again, it&#39;s generally better to have the same brand/size/speed/etc. as the original stick(s).&quot;, Would i notice any significant slow down if i were to go with just 1 more stick since 1 stick still works? I am going with the same size if i do, 2 gigs, speed is average, so speed should be same too, but brand might be diff.</description>

              <p>Not the ram timings, ive got them set at the advertised, same as before my system crashed. atm i am running fine, i increased some shit in bios, cant remember what it was but one from 200 to 1000 and one from 8^ 8v to 16^ 16v. I still only have 2 gigs of ram though, i found another stick and tested it, if i opened my computer with that stick in also then the screen would blue a bit and tonnes of horizontal lines popped up. ATM i am gunna keep it how it is, I really need to rma the ram though. I am about 70% sure the proc is fine now, i am assuming the other stick i tried was shot too.</p>

              <p>If the BSOD happens to say “IRQ_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL” it could be the ram timings in your BIOS. I once added a new stick of ram to the machine, and kept getting those BSODs, but after increasing the ram timing it worked just fine.</p>

<p>Hitting it won’t fix anything, if one stick of RAM works and the other doesn’t, it is obviously the one stick of RAM that is bad.
