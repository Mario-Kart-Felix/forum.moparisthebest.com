    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-508-server/433991</link>
    <description>I downloaded a 508 and im trying to edit it a bit, this one is coded so when you click a stat you teleport to the place a NPC is located and when you speak to him he gives you free items to get that stat up.

Really need to change this for prayer please help</description>
