    <title>Need help with 508 server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-508-server/234177</link>
    <description>I need to know how to start the server, I did everything from the guide &quot;how to make a 508 server work&quot; but I can&#39;t figure it out, it gets stuck at connecting to update server and then it says error_game_js5connect. I think it&#39;s because the server is off, but I&#39;m not sure how to turn it on, and also there is no compiler. There is no run.bat either and I looked for it.

thanks for helping.</description>

<p>I am not completely sure because i’m not in to 508s, however I do like the fact that you have half way decent grammar. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
