    <description>^^ about a couple months ago?Maybe someone send a packet for example hit the rock,but used a program to modify the packet until,say it became a attack someone packet?It would be able to attack other people outside the wildy,and say,attack someone for 50 damage?.

Just asking,but I think packet modification is dead,or is not possible...</description>

              <p>That’s not how it works. If you sent a packet that said you were attacking somebody, the server would give you “You can’t attack players outside of wilderness” message. The server applies damage, not the packets sent from the client. The client is just the GUI.</p>
