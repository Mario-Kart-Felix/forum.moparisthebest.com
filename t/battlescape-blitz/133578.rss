              <p>BattleScape Blitz was fun. But I never liked how the pking was. I am a pker, so I expect to find a good pk server. After like a week of maxing out my stats of BattleScape Blitz, I figure out that everyone hits common 40 damage without an actionTimer on rune darts with full dharoks.</p>
<p>Most annoying shit in the world. Your training, and all of a sudden you get 2 hit by some random noob with darts. Make the pking better, and make bows slower. Also reduce bonuses on some weapons / armor.</p>
<p>The pking was the worst I have ever seen in my entire life.</p>
<p>But everything else was pretty good, you had an economy, but it wasn’t too good. People could dupe items pretty simply, because food was stackable. The drops were fine, but the shops… there was pretty much everything you needed right there in the shops. Try and shorten the shops, and make people kill for Barrows. Also don’t leave 500k on the ground as an auto-spawn. Make people work for their cash, and add more rare drops to NPC’s, and enforce NPC training at a fair XP rate. Also add many skills and better training areas to enforce skillers, pures, whatever.</p>
<p>If you did that and hosted it on a dedicated 24/7 server, you would have 250 + players online all day and night.</p>
<p>It may be HARD WORK, but it’s worth doing it. Trust me. Zdiddy Reloaded did something VERY similar, but it had glitches, lag, errors, barrage glitches, prayer glitches, a bad game-client, and no pking. But! It had multiple ways to train, earn cash, a VERY balanced economy, and helpful mods on 24/7. That’s what made Zdiddy addicting. Which is where I am going right now.</p>
