    <description>Hey, one of you god like coders out there.
I am sure you can help me so please do,

I would like it if you were to show me how to make it so graardor does damage to people attacking him.

(i have added him so he walks fine, punches fine, blocks fine and dies fine all the emotes are there ect)

But when i fight him he doesnt do any damage to me!
 i have tried to edit some code to make him do damage but no its just constant 0&#39;s please help me

For my final request i ask that you tell or show me how to make it so he has a 1/5 chance of using another of his attack emotes and dealing damage to every player close to him and healing 100+- 50 hp.

[size=36pt]Thanks upfront![/size]</description>

              <p>You’ll have to add it into your npchandler class.<br>
Example code to show you how it works, many many changes can be applied, not here to spoonfeed.</p>
<p><code>
if(npcs[NPCID].npcType == xxxx) {
npcs[NPCID].animNumber = 1844;//npc animation
hitDiff = 15;//what he'll hit
plr.stillgfx(444, npcs[NPCID].absY, npcs[NPCID].absX);//gfx of player
npcs[NPCID].HP += 60;//heals npc +60 hp
plr.attackPlayersWithin2(160, 30, 30);//player can retaliate if within this distance
plr.playerLevel[5] -= 3;//lowers stat number 5
plr.sendQuest("" + plr.playerLevel[5] + "", 4012);//shows the player that their stat has been lowered on the skill tab
}</code></p>
<p>There are many many more things you may add and change this code around. Examples</p>
<p>[code=java]<br>
hitDiff = 50 + misc.random(50);//the code you asked for between 50 and 100</p>
<p>//Adding protection prayers<br>
if(npcs[NPCID].npcType == xxxx &amp;&amp; plr.ProtMelee)<br>
if(npcs[NPCID].npcType == xxxx &amp;&amp; plr.ProtMage)<br>
//and if they’re not praying<br>
if(npcs[NPCID].npcType == xxxx &amp;&amp; !plr.ProtMelee)<br>
if(npcs[NPCID].npcType == xxxx &amp;&amp; !plr.ProtMage)</p>
<p>//the special hit code with 10% chance<br>
if(npcs[NPCID].npcType == xxxx &amp;&amp; misc.random(10) == 1)[/code]</p>

              <p>im thinking its in your config/npc if hes in here then edit the level hp and respawn time if not add him and add in the stuff for it i think thats your problem but may not be idk I once ran a server blank and had a woman spawned at start and would hit upwards of 20 on me and the npc set at a regman so <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> just see if that works</p>
