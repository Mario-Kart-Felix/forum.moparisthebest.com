    <title>Adding an in game music player?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-an-in-game-music-player/546511</link>
    <description>id just like to know how to make a simple music player for rsc, by just clickingo on tracks, and then they play. but then have a line of tracks that play after the game logs in. so a theme song&gt; then goes to other songs. i think adding songs for locations might be difficult, but then again, theres some pretty kick-ass java experts out ther, eh? :D</description>

              <p>ok, yeah, i just was wondering how the game would make the track transitions</p>
<p>but i would like the script. also would the options for it be under settings?</p>
<p>also i want a track to play when the game starts up, and then login it keps going until its over, then it plays the tracks depending on coords. also when you die, it plays a track, and also when your poisned, or really low on health. that kind of thing.</p>

              <p>If you want you can handle it all client sided which would be easier to implement however it limits you from doing a lot. But if you only want something basic you can handle it all client sided. You can play by the tracks depending on the players x,y (the coords are available client sided).</p>
<p>If you need the code, Iâ€™ll message it.</p>
