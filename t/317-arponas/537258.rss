[center][b]What is Arponas?[/b]

Arponas is a Runescape Private Server that is based off of one of the most popular private servers of the &#39;06 Era, Dodian. You all say that there are too many Dodian Remakes, but this was one of the most popular and we are trying to recover our player base that we had before we went down. We now have a new ownership, and then me, as a global mod.

[b]What do we want to accomplish on Arponas?[/b]

We really want to add a lot of new things, while still using the Dodian base and keeping the nostalgia feel. It&#39;s been a struggle because Danno, the original creator of Dodian made things really different than most servers. However, we have been progressing rather well and we are hoping to really bring back the Dodian age in this server.

[b]Where does the server stand now?[/b]

Well, we are currently at the beginning of the server release. Server has been up for about a week now and the 10-20 people we have online that are active have been grinding out some skills. We have had some mishap, but dealt with it, and now we have a great group of staff as well as a lot more updates, such as new bosses, new drops and better highscores. We will continue to be making updates as things go on so bare with us.

[b]Why should we give you a chance?[/b]

To be perfectly honest, the server itself isn&#39;t the top. However, what has kept us together through all the struggle was the community. I have played a lot of private servers in my time and a lot of them I leave close to instantly, because they never have the community that I really want. A lot of the players are more on the mature side, which I feel is always important. I guess I just feel that if you have a break from Rs 07 or maybe you can&#39;t afford it. It&#39;d be a good server to check out.
