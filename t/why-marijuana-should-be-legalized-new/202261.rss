    <title>Why marijuana should be legalized.(new)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-marijuana-should-be-legalized-new/202261</link>
    <description>[b]I just started my legalization essay. I have worked about an hour on it, and i would say its pretty good for an hour. It is attached to the bottom of this post. Please download it and read it, you definitely won&#39;t regret it.[/b]

I strongly recommend you watch the movie Super High Me. It is a documentary. It disproves many cannabis &quot;myths&quot;.


As i come across articles on why marijuana should be legalized, i will put them here:

<p>Well you can take a look at how it works in other countries and see that this has not been a problem. In the Netherlands you can buy weed in coffee shops, as well as grow up to 5 plants. The amount of pot smokers is roughly the same, and their use of harder drugs is MUCH MUCH lower.</p>

<p>The gateway theory is garbage and meaningless. Too lazy to explain it as it’s already been said before, so read this: <a href="http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/statistics/statistics_info2.shtml" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/statistics/statistics_info2.shtml</a></p>

<p>Marijuana is an expectorant, which means it will clear all the tubes and your lungs and shit by bringing up mucus… It also dilates the air channels. Smog and pollutants are removed from your lungs from this. Also, weed actually kills aging and mutating cells, preventing cancer.</p>

              <p>[quote=“ThatOneServer, post:16, topic:202261”]Just learned something. Marijuana was illegalized as a direct result from this quote:</p>
<p>The following are excerpts of Mr. Anslinger’s testimony before a Senate hearing on marijuana in 1937: “There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others. … The primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races. Marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity, criminality and death. You smoke a joint and you’re likely to kill your brother. Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.”[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah a lot of it had to do with races and stuff. The main thing happening at that time was that the major chemical company DuPont had patents on things such as paper from tree’s, plastic from oil, and some materials used for clothing such as nylon. Marijuana was becoming a popular method to make paper, plastic from hemp oil, and clothing because it was cheap and durable. DuPont was going to lose billions of dollars. The head of the federal bureau of narcotics was the nephew of duponts chief financial backer. Dupont and some other companies such as DOW, along with the government, made a lot of marijuana propaganda which made everyone totally afraid of it. And then, they made it illegal after that.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t that make them addicted to the chemical rather than the pot?[/quote]<br>
no anything can be addicting it all passes through the rewards system which makes it addicting.</p>

              <p>Just learned something. Marijuana was illegalized as a direct result from this quote:</p>
<p>The following are excerpts of Mr. Anslinger’s testimony before a Senate hearing on marijuana in 1937: “There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others. … The primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races. Marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity, criminality and death. You smoke a joint and you’re likely to kill your brother. Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.”</p>

I don’t know much about marijuana, and I don’t know if it can be “grown wrong”, but I had a comment/question.</p>
<p>If public distribution of marijuana was much higher, which would let more (and possibly less responsible) people grow weed, wouldn’t there be a bigger amount of “bad” weed circulating?</p>
<p>Sorry, as I said before, maybe it’s not even possible to ruin marijuana, but it was just a thought.</p>

<p>I’m pretty dead right now so I’m not sure I am reading you correctly, but if more people were growing, than you should be able to find someone you know you can trust to grow it.</p>
<p>Unless you’re using a shitload of pesticides or chemicals, the only thing you have to worry about when growing is trying to get maximum potency. The main problem with “bad weed” is that some people add shit to it so it will weigh more. People have been known to sell weed with rubber, glass, sand, etc just so that it will weigh more and they can sell more. If growing it were legal, you wouldn’t have to worry about that because you will know exactly what goes into your weed.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, I believe they are allowed to grow up to 5 plants. As far as I know, they are doing just fine. Infact they have some of the best weed in the world.</p>
<p>I’ll post my essay later. It’s a piece of garbage because I rushed it all in one night. I don’t wanna post it just yet incase google indexes it, and this teacher goes a lot of lenghs to find people plaigarizing and I dont want him to find it here.[/quote]</p>
<p>Hmm, that’s pretty interesting about the Netherlands part.</p>
<p>Couldn’t people also sneak little chemicals or substances into pot to get people addicted?</p>

<p>Well, not trying to be rude but it really only takes a quick search.</p>
<p>Anyways this one has 1000 seeders, but it screwed up half way through the download. <a href="http://www.mininova.org/tor/1338393" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mininova.org/tor/1338393</a></p>

<p>There are only dvd screeners available, so I’m not sure about the quality. Surely the quality will be far better then mega video though.</p>
