    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/automated-donation-system/303988</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m looking to make an automatic donation system for my server.

Such as, 
Person 1 goes to the server website. They go to the donation page. There is a list of things to buy, items, skills, donater status. They select one and then pay with Paypal. Once the payment is received through Paypal. The person then gets the item in game. 

I know that this would require PHP, MySQL and of course Java. My question to you is. Is it possible? And how would I go about starting this?</description>

<p>I think you would be better of monitoring what things are bought and just add them. The automatic part seems like a lot of working connecting your site with your server. So ya, Monitor the sales.[/quote]<br>
monitoring the donation isnt an automated system, ill give u 2 reasons why<br>
1.) he still has to give them donator<br>
2.)him checking is defying the purpose of this thread, “automated”</p>

Yes it is possible.<br>
And to start off if you already have mysql try looking at your method when you have to register on forums its pretty much same thing .</p>
<p>i was trying to find something other than mysql, because tbh mysql is sloppy .<br>
but what i did was just make a business paypal account, and automated email attachment with certain donated amounts so if someone donated 60$ for mod it will send them a command that they can type ingame, and the command is constantly changing automatically for example.</p>
<p>Dear Donator, thank you for your donation amount of 60.00$ here is your command to type ingame [::mod435]<br>
and then the next command would be randomized with 3 numbers at end for example [::mod675] and it cna only be used once.</p>
