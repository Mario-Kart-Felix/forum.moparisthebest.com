    <title>How to permanently delete files</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-permanently-delete-files/157077</link>
    <description>Ever wonder if a file that you put in the recycling bin is really gone? Well, the truth is that it&#39;s not.  A simple recovery tool can easily recovered deleted files including internet history, cache, programs, and anything that was put in the recycling bin.  When you attempt to delete files that way, all you&#39;re really doing is marking the file to be written over by another program if it needs to.  And even after the file is written over, it is still possible to recover files.  I am attaching two programs, Eraser and CCleaner.  Ccleaner permanently deletes all files associated with Internet (cache, history, cookies, etc.)
The other program completely wipes out all files on the free space of the hard drive to United States Department of Defense specifications.

Enjoy.

<p>That’s exactly it, you can NEVER get rid of information on a computer. There are programs such as, i think it’s called WinHex or something like that (it costs like $100+) But yes the only way to rid of info is by buying a new hard drive or nuking it, smelting it, bio-chemical it, ect. And even if you “write” it over, there are still little bits on info STILL there. I only know this because of Digital Forensics, it’s a very good subject to get on.<br>

Pro programs writes all bits to 0 so no data is possible to read.<br>

<p>Actually, if the data is sensitive, zero-ing out a drive is NOT an effective method of shredding files.<br>
You need to make multiple passes, writing with different values each time, to combat people using physically techniques such as magnetic force microscopy. Apparently you don’t need to do this with modern drives, but hey, there’s still a lot of old drives about, and it never hurts to be cautious.</p>

That deletes whatever file you drag to it…can it be recover…it doen’t go into the recycling bin it deletes it and i dont think it writes over the data with random data…but i could make it do that…</p>

<p>There is no way to read files that are overwritten.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, actually you can sorry. You can still retrieve alot of information from overwritten files, and if its only overwritten once then you can get pretty much everything. Pedophiles overwrite alot of their files if they think police are going to raid them and yet they still get found. Read some articles on it it’s definitely possible.</p>

I have read other articles written by people that work with recive things for corrupted and formated disk, and they have no tools that can read overwritten data, and that is noone that have.</p>

i keep telling people this… the ONLY way to effectively destroy data off your harddrive, is to physically destroy the drive, Smashing and burning/melting does wonders. Hardware used by the military and law enforcement can read what has been written over many times… i might suggest, if you decide to go with a software solution, is to use a very good program, multiple times… say, 20+ times? lol… DBAN (dariks boot and nuke) for instance… the program eraser says: “Eraser is an advanced security tool for Windows that allows you to completely remove sensitive data from your hard drive by overwriting it several times with carefully selected patterns. The patterns used for overwriting are based on Peter Gutmann’s paper Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory and are selected to effectively remove magnetic remnants from the hard drive.” Notice several times with carefully selected patterns…</p>

<p>Yes, actually you can sorry. You can still retrieve alot of information from overwritten files, and if its only overwritten once then you can get pretty much everything. Pedophiles overwrite alot of their files if they think police are going to raid them and yet they still get found. Read some articles on it it’s definitely possible.</p>

</aside>
<p>No, the original poster is correct.</p>
<p>When you delete a file, the space that file was using is marked as free, and other programs can now write to that space (thats why your hard drive space isn’t taken up) - however, the data is not gone until something writes to that space.</p>
<p>EDIT: This is why, if you corrupt a hard drive and call a data recovery company, the first thing they will tell you is to turn the PC off and do not use it until they have seen it - because the more you use the PC, the more likely it is that you will overwrite the data.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>So there is less chance of recovering my old files if I keep my HD full of shit?[/quote]</p>
<p>Sort of. The more write operations you do on a daily basis, the less chance there is of recovering your files. However, its much easier to use a shredding tool that makes multiple passes. Basically these properly delete a file, by marking the space as free AND writing over the data multiple times with random data. This pretty much fucks software-based recovery tools, as for hardware that the military/law enforcement would use… I’m fairly sure it would fuck them too, but who could ever be sure.</p>

<p>No, the original poster is correct.</p>
<p>When you delete a file, the space that file was using is marked as free, and other programs can now write to that space (thats why your hard drive space isn’t taken up) - however, the data is not gone until something writes to that space.</p>
<p>EDIT: This is why, if you corrupt a hard drive and call a data recovery company, the first thing they will tell you is to turn the PC off and do not use it until they have seen it - because the more you use the PC, the more likely it is that you will overwrite the data.</p>
