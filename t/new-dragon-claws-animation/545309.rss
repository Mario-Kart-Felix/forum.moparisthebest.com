    <title>New Dragon Claws Animation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-dragon-claws-animation/545309</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;m using a pretty clean basic 317 PI source and client, and I added dragon claws. The source doesn&#39;t have the anim for the legit dragon claw special, only the ugly old one. How would I go upon adding the animation for the real dragon claw special attack, if possible? I have no experience with this and have never tried it. I searched around and couldn&#39;t find anything.</description>
