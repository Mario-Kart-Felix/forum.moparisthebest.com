    <title>Working (semi-refactored) RSC Client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/working-semi-refactored-rsc-client/528662</link>
    <description>Is anyone currently working on a compatible (as in it currently works with the Jagex RSC Server to-date) client? Is mudclient 233 the latest? Also, will a refactored 204 work? Anyways I have no mudclients at all, and was wondering if some of you can share them with me. I can do the refactoring, however I&#39;d greatly appreciate if it already had some work done to it.

Cheers,
