    <title>Client/Cache Help ASAP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-cache-help-asap/544270</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, i purchased a vps a few days ago and i am now really angry that it is going ALL to waste. I have had it for like 10 days and have not used it once and i am very upset of this because i only purchased a month.

The problem i am having is that when people download my cache it says &quot;error loading... contact staff!&quot; and i do not know how to fix it. People said my client cannot read the cache and i changed everything it still dont work.. I need help asap someone please.

Skype: Saeed_778866

Questions:
Q1: How do i make a new cache? i copied all the files INSIDE the cache folder and upload to dropbox and when others download they dont get all the files that i upload
Q2: Which folders do i change from 127.0.0.1 to my VPS ip? gui? client? server? i dont get it..

It will be VERY appreciated if someone helps me. I Will love you f0r3v3r!

Note: Cache IS in c drive..
