It’s a good server, the forums are wore than the massive signatures on R-S, but the server is decent enough.<br>
I think training is average speed, a few days to get max if I remember right</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">About us:</span><br>
Epicurus has been open since March of 2011, almost about 2 years as of now, and we have never failed to deliver. We spend money every month on the best possible technology to keep you, the player, satisfied with us. We have powerful servers with great DDoS protection, to ensure that you are always able to get on and play, no matter what time of the day it is.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Our worlds:</span><br>
Epicurus runs three worlds on login. They are actual worlds, and not just worlds you use commands to get to. The first world is an economic world where skillers and hardcore players get together, the second world is a player killing world, where items come easy, but respect and fame comes hard, and finally, the third world is a spawn server, but not your average spawn server. Check out the sticky in our Announcements to read up about it.</p>
