    <description>Resolution: &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; is a fundamentally good idea.
I probably won&#39;t post on this thread and I will not post my opinion.  Go ahead, state your opinion along with an argument.  Be sure to see both sides!

EDIT: the reason I didn&#39;t say my opinion because I didn&#39;t want to influence a &quot;not sure&quot; person.  Whenever I am in group projects in school and another kid doesn&#39;t pull his weight, I get angry.  I am a communist at heart, so I would love to see this work.  I think this is really obvious; it works like taxes.  Bill Gates clearly should pay more than and middle class person because he has more to give.  I, a wood chopper down person, am extremely stupid.  All I can do is cut wood.  Somebody else though, a scientist of some sort who is truly a genius, can do almost anything.  In this society, I will be &quot;payed&quot; the same as the scientist.  If you think this is unfair, it wasn&#39;t my fault I was stupid, so how could it be fair that he gets payed more and has a better lifestyle?

Goodbye for now, if I don&#39;t respond to you, I am probably sleeping.</description>

<p>I voted “strongly disagree”. I don’t believe someone “dumb” ,as you put it, deserves to make the same wages as someone as a higher mental caliper. Obviously, the smart person has more to offer for society imo and deserves all he makes.</p>
<p>And yes, I just spewed some words. I’m an American, therefore I think “Commies Suck! lolz0rz”</p>

              <p>Resolution: “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need” is a fundamentally good idea.<br>
I probably won’t post on this thread and I will not post my opinion.  Go ahead, state your opinion along with an argument.  Be sure to see both sides!</p>
<p>EDIT: the reason I didn’t say my opinion because I didn’t want to influence a “not sure” person.  Whenever I am in group projects in school and another kid doesn’t pull his weight, I get angry.  I am a communist at heart, so I would love to see this work.  I think this is really obvious; it works like taxes.  Bill Gates clearly should pay more than and middle class person because he has more to give.  I, a wood chopper down person, am extremely stupid.  All I can do is cut wood.  Somebody else though, a scientist of some sort who is truly a genius, can do almost anything.  In this society, I will be “payed” the same as the scientist.  If you think this is unfair, it wasn’t my fault I was stupid, so how could it be fair that he gets payed more and has a better lifestyle?</p>
<p>Goodbye for now, if I don’t respond to you, I am probably sleeping.</p>
