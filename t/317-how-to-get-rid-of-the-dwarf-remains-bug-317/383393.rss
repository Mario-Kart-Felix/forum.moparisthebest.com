    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-how-to-get-rid-of-the-dwarf-remains-bug-317/383393</link>
    <description>Hey everyone! After two weeks of research, search bar usage and google search usage, I still have no found out the solution to getting rid of the dwarf remains bug. 
My program should indeed be saving my character as my code includes the code to save the character after logging out. Are there specific things that I am doing that might lead to the bug in the first place? I really wish a pro would help me out with this....this is the code that is in my source:
[code=java]     if (token.equals(&quot;character-equip&quot;)) {
      playerEquipment[Integer.parseInt(token3[0])] = Integer
        .parseInt(token3[1]);
      playerEquipmentN[Integer.parseInt(token3[0])] = Integer
        .parseInt(token3[2]);
     }[/code]

[code=java]    for (int i = 0; i &lt; playerEquipment.length; i++) {
     if (playerEquipment[i] == 0) {
      playerEquipment[i] = -1;
      playerEquipmentN[i] = 0;
     }[/code]

Please tell me what I need to add or fix to remove this bug. Btw, the bug is as follows:

-resets, items, bank looks and equipped items</description>
