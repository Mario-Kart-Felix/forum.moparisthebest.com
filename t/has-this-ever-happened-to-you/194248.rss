    <title>Has this ever happened to you</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/has-this-ever-happened-to-you/194248</link>
    <description>A year ago I made a private server based off of I think it was either cheezscape or project 16, but it worked fine, no lag and fit around 50 people comfortably. Only once in about 2 hours of the server running would it need to be reset. But now I have spent about a week working with Richscape v2, and now when I finally release my server, after about 1 minute of players connecting my computer crashes, and actually my computer is better than it was before. 2GB of RAM instead of 1GB. Could it be just the source? I am so confused... and upset... I wan&#39;t to succeed and am not giving up. So I am hoping there is a solution for this  :)</description>
