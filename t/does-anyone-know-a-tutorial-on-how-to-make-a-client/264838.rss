    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anyone-know-a-tutorial-on-how-to-make-a-client/264838</link>
    <description>I LOOKED IN THE TUTORIAL SECTION AND DIDNT SEE ONE.
if its on moparisthebest.com/smf or not idc i just need a guide on how to create a client. 
Basic ones will do fine I am a patient learner.

PLEASE only post if you have something to say that pertains to the question, dont comment on other peoples posts thats just a waste of time.
