              <p>Evidence?</p>
<p>pros:</p>
<p>-smf has better themes ( by default, true doesn’t mean you can’t create your own mybb theme! )<br>
-better admin controls/security<br>
-user friendly ( can be argued )<br>
-more vast amount of mods for the noobs.</p>
<p>my bb pros:<br>
-simple/lightweight ish<br>
-reminds me of vbulletin sort of<br>
-love the plugin system overall</p>

<p>As i stated in my other post it’s all biased opinions.</p>
<p>I still say though for a rsps at least your better off with SMF.</p>

<p>Which reminds me…good job derailing a perfectly good advertisement.</p>

You have no hard evidence that can possibly show SMF is better than any forum software. Judging software by the features is completely ridiculous, because if they can create a forum software from scratch, they most likely can implement many more features.</p>

<p>In this day and age people want user integration for all of the major sites out there facebook etc. (at least to my knowledge but I haven’t used it in a good two years)</p>
<p>However as far as I know at least mybb does not offer this feature. I have never liked either the way font is displayed in mybb(at least in firefox never tired in other browsers)</p>
<p>I will say though the one thing I always liked about mybb was how easy it is to change theme design/edit</p>
<p>Also from a community standpoint the mybb community is absolutely horrid. (True though what software forum community is?)</p>
<p>There just aren’t enough useful/worthy plugins in general.</p>
