    <title>I don&#39;t like arrays &gt;.&lt;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-dont-like-arrays/397623</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using this in an RSPS, but it could be used in anything coded in java, so I figured it would be better suited here than in the server help section.

Anyway, I have this variable declared in one of my classes. (Not gonna use the exact one, I&#39;ll just use an example.)
It&#39;s this type of array that I&#39;ve never worked with before.

[code]private int[][][] something = {
   {
      {1, 2, 3},
      {1, 2}
   },
   {
      {1, 2, 3, 4},
      {1, 2, 3},
      {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   }
};
[/code]

I&#39;m trying to find the length of only one of the sets in the array.
Let&#39;s say I wanted the length of this specific one: (The one colored in red)

&lt;blockquote&gt;private int[][][] something = {
   {
      {1, 2, 3},
      {1, 2}
   },
   {
      {1, 2, 3, 4},
      {1, 2, 3},
      {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   }
}&lt;/blockquote&gt;



How would I do this?
I know the length is 5, but need a method of finding it with a command, like the same way you would find the length of a simple array such as [code]public int[] example = {1, 2, 3};[/code]</description>

<p>Thanks for the help. I’ll try rethinking the design too, lol</p>

<p>Although, if your in a situation like this, you should probably rethink the design.</p>
