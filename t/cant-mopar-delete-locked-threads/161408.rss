    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-mopar-delete-locked-threads/161408</link>
    <description>well i go around and see there are soooo many locked threads and i have to filter through them. check out page 2! well it would help if mopar deleted locked threads so its easier to go though threads or doesnt he delete them because he wants to show everyone why they locked the thread or something?</description>
