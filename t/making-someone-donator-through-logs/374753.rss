    <title>Making someone donator through logs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-someone-donator-through-logs/374753</link>
    <description>Hello Guys, please help me with this problem here. I have got a server and it has donator feature hence to make a player donator, I would need to go to the character file and change something like donator = 0 to donator = 1.

I would want the server to read the donator status base on the log file &quot;donator&quot; which is already in the folder logs. Meaning I would just need to type the name into the file and he would be a donator instead of me changing the character file.

Thank You/</description>
