      I was at first completely failing Geometry and stopped doing homework (I&#39;m in 8th grade in a 10th grade class in a charter school) then I started doing my homework and now I&#39;m passing, but oh look! I have to makeup 3 assignments anyways and a test. 
       So my teacher highlighted some assignments to do on progress report, and 2/3 of them are in the chapter 4 one (The one where I have to take the test) so I have 5 days, starting tomorrow, to get them done, completely master a whole chapter I took months ago, and get 70%+ on the test, when there are many proofs, I have tried many math / geometry helping sites, took quizzes, etc. but I saw [u]NONE[/u] with proofs on them. I also searched google for just proof help and gave up after about 10 pages, none were helpful.
       I would really appreciate if somebody knew a site that helps with proofs or could tell me in here about how to learn them very simply, yes, I have looked at a proof and looked at the back of the book, but it is still confusing. (proofs are Paragraph, Flow, and 2 column) most of the questions are about SAS AAS SSS, etc. If you have recently taken geometry, you should have had this chapter and know what I mean, but you may have not have. 

----------------------------------------SHORT VERSION------------------------------------------------
I&#39;m screwed over in Geometry unless I get 2 assignments done because I never did them because I hate proofs, so I must complete ly master a chapter with SAS, SSS, AAS, etc proofs in just 5 days for a test. Please tell me how to learn quickly or a nice site (I&#39;ve tried 10 pages of google)</description>

<p>And yea Textbooks have the answers for this. I had to do a math journal for this shit.</p>

              <p>textbooks are always a good start. If you textbooks have answers for the odds in the back just read the answers and you’ll get to understanding. Remember, there is no ASS theorem. (it was a joke in my geometry class) I took geometry in 8th grade like you. I’m in 9th now.</p>
