              <p>[quote=“elyad, post:20, topic:381964”]It’s a no brainer. If RSC Just Re-Released RSC. Enabled players to create accounts, F2P &amp; P2P Servers, The cash flow would roll in for them. The game runs itself, There’s no need for updates. Just basic moderating of botters. It makes no sense why you would just completely disregard a game that made your company what it is today. And without the Loyal players of RSC then Jagex would not exist.</p>
<p>Even on the 2 week Trial, They added extra servers, And each server was full with over 1k Players in each. It just shows how much potential profit there would be in RSC for them.</p>
<p>Weather they do this or not is a different matter, And this case will be continued to be argued for years to come. Ah well.</p>
<p>Has anybody ever thought of putting a petition together, For the Re-Release of RSC &amp; Enabling people to re-create accounts? If enough people could get involved, And we continued to persuade them, Then maybe it could happen?[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m pretty that a petition has been attempted in the past and if I remember correctly, it was signed by a decent amount of people. Though that was AWHILE back and since Jagex seems to be STARTING to actually pay attention to the players, I don’t see why another try won’t hurt. Honestly there’s nothing to lose, if they don’t…they don’t, if they do then all the hard work has paid off.</p>

<p>Ok so <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">no one</span></span> on aftermath complained there was no pking? not one single player ever said, “wheres the pking?”, no your right. You should tottaly flame the one guy who doesnt complain ingame to random players and logs out, but actually wants to improve things for the better and goes to the forums for direct communication to the developers/staff with suggestions, for change. After this happens on a regular basis, maybe i start to care less about peoples feelings and shape some of my opinions to deliver the most effect that would provoke attention and hopefully change. Where does a bunch of ‘yes’ men get you dan?</p>
<p>Back on topic, yes IF f2p AND p2p worlds were brought back for runescape, id agree with you as its only logical. An uncalled for attack against me, without p2p worlds being in any part of the original question/debate on the other hand, isnt.[/quote]<br>
Ask Pomp, he’ll tell you. Ask anyone who admin’d on Aftermath, they’ll tell you.<br>
I was talking about the the landscape, not about PKing. But yeah I guess you can go off topic</p>

<p>Yes RS2 is based off RSC, I can agree with you there. However the brains behind the whole project was in Andrews mind and when he decided to let other people in on behind the game content… it really just wasn’t the same. Yes he had the final word if it was implemented or not but again, you just can’t develop a game then let other people take it over without some kind of consequence. Even the people he hired have never played runescape in their life <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> yet one of them is the CEO (which is finally making good choices and putting things how they should be). Mark was rusty at the start, now I believe he gets the idea of what players want. He showed interest in RSC and that is why RSC was opened up. So there is always the possibility that it will be reopened again.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/elyad">@Elyad</a>, Petitions have very little affect (from past trials). However as you stated the game runs itself which will follow my next few statements.</p>
<p>I was recently at the airport and the only guy next to me was this Asian who was on his laptop. We got into a conversation as he was headed to China and I to my destination. We talked about what games he plays on his computer and we only had one game in common… starcraft. Starcraft has been around since 1998 and yet still thrives to this day. The graphics are not the best (to me they are fucking sexy). I asked the guy for his name online and he said he doesn’t play online. I was shocked. I asked what do you do then? He explained he can’t get online because he only has starcraft beta because it was free. RSC was free and yet ran on 100mb of memory so the shittiest computers could hold it. Yet I was still amazed that I found a group of people who have never played runescape, WoW, or any online mmorpg.</p>

              <p>It’s a no brainer. If RSC Just Re-Released RSC. Enabled players to create accounts, F2P &amp; P2P Servers, The cash flow would roll in for them. The game runs itself, There’s no need for updates. Just basic moderating of botters. It makes no sense why you would just completely disregard a game that made your company what it is today. And without the Loyal players of RSC then Jagex would not exist.</p>
<p>Even on the 2 week Trial, They added extra servers, And each server was full with over 1k Players in each. It just shows how much potential profit there would be in RSC for them.</p>
<p>Weather they do this or not is a different matter, And this case will be continued to be argued for years to come. Ah well.</p>
<p>Has anybody ever thought of putting a petition together, For the Re-Release of RSC &amp; Enabling people to re-create accounts? If enough people could get involved, And we continued to persuade them, Then maybe it could happen?</p>

<p>Ok so <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">no one</span></span> on aftermath complained there was no pking? not one single player ever said, “wheres the pking?”, no your right. You should tottaly flame the one guy who doesnt complain ingame to random players and logs out, but actually wants to improve things for the better and goes to the forums for direct communication to the developers/staff with suggestions, for change. After this happens on a regular basis, maybe i start to care less about peoples feelings and shape some of my opinions to deliver the most effect that would provoke attention and hopefully change. Where does a bunch of ‘yes’ men get you dan?</p>
<p>Back on topic, yes IF f2p AND p2p worlds were brought back for runescape, id agree with you as its only logical. An uncalled for attack against me, without p2p worlds being in any part of the original question/debate on the other hand, isnt.</p>

Pomp didn’t layout shit for anybody. I did every last bit of that landscape myself, but nice try there. I put whatever the fuck I wanted where ever the fuck I wanted. And yeah, like I said before, you’re the only retard who bitches on every single forum. And like I said before, no1 has complained but you. So I think it’s good.</p>
