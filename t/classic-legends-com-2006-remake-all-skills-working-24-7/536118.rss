Hi Moparscape

Today i want to release my 2006 Remake. It&#39;s based on CreativeScape, so many credits go to R0cky 0wnz for his perfect source.
I did many edits on the Original CreativeScape source. Been working on this server for a long time and i think it&#39;s now time to release it.

~Features~

- All 21 Skills are working
- The server is 24/7 Online
- Duel Arena is working
- Fight Caves are working
- Castle Wars is working
- Pest Control is working
- Perfect combat system
- All 2006 Shops
- All 2006 NPC Spawns
- And much much more!
