    <title>Webclient Connecting Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-connecting-help/373178</link>
    <description>I got my webclient running on-line although when i load it and try to connect it shows a connection error and this is what the server says:
[IMG]http://i174.photobucket.com/albums/w110/skaterdude9606/help.png[/img]
it also flashes that the client has been updated although i downloaded these two for my server: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,459744.msg3363860.html#msg3363860]AirScape[/url]
Also it has to do with something i did wrong on making the server bacause online the edited webclient version does this not the one that cam with the package
I changed the serverip var in Gui to my IP also

Any help? I have a 317 and i followed this tut: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,336494.0.html]Ric&#39;s Webclient Tut[/url]
