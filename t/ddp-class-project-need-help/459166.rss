    <description>Problem : You must successfully drop one washer into a designated target (a box) from an airplane that slides on a string. There are several limitations

1. You can only use the parts that are listed below. 
2. You will work in groups of 2.
3. Set-up, drop and dismantle all within 30 seconds. all items must be removed from the area within 30 seconds and no marks or objects are to be left on the line.
4. Once a plane is set into motion, nothing can be touched until drop is done.
5. Plane needs to be within 6&quot; from the top of runway when set in motion
6. Any Target washer needs to be mounted within six inches of the plane.
7. In the box is defined as: touching the bottom of the box and staying in the box, and not bouncing out.
8. All ideas must be patented. For a parent you need 2 sketches with both of your names on each sketch. Patent &quot;how washer is released&quot; and &quot;what triggers the release&quot;. Sketches should be neat and well labled.
9. Each roup needs at least 2 different sketched ideas.

Those are the Limitations...

Here is ths Supplies we get

1 Block of Wood (6x6)
Two Screw Eyes
Six Feet of String
2 Rubber Bands
Two Paper clips (Jumbo)
two Washers
Two thumb tacks
12 inches of masking tape
One piece of paper (4x6 index card)

I really need to start doing good this year! I really have no idea what to do! Please post any suggestions

Thanks</description>
