<p>As the dollar regains its value + as the Federal Reserve raises its rates your going to pay more in Finland even if the price of oil stays constant.  you have been partically shield due to the higher interest rates you guys had their 2for the past few years.<br>

Are you kidding me??? It’s a known fact, his family is in the oil industry. The whole family owns Oil wells and everything. Oh ya, wake up from the American dream, the news is controlled. Mark my words, him making money on oil, will be all over the news in like 2 years when he leaves.

Yeah yeah I know we have oil, but we’re running out. We can have small amounts of oil in 1000s diff places, but the point is… we are seriously running out. In the next 10-20 years, gasoline will be gone. In the next 5 years (I’m hoping), we will switch to a different source of energy.</p>

<p>I voted for Bush in 04, I was not old enough in 00.  And about the people losing rights it is normal under war time.  the democrat solution is no invasion, no offense, pure defense.  For defense to work, it will require the complete lost of rights, do you know how difficult defnse is compared to offense?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m afraid I must’ve missed that amendment when I was last reading the Constitution. Which one says, “The rights enumerated above are only applicable if the federal government is not at war, and when it is, uhhh, nevermind”? My acquaintance with the law is limited; please clear this up for me. We don’t get to prattle on about being “defenders of liberty” and such things if we’re willing to curtail rights because we’re “at war.” Wartime is when they must be most unfettered.</p>
<p>Civil rights being protected from interference by the government is the core value of our society. This is absolutely non-negotiable.</p>

<p>Oh i bet your one of millions that all cried when bush decided not to fund FEDERAL stem cell research.  Look any company can go out and do research, however the incentive is reduced due to all the health oriented lawsuits daily, also the animal rights/eco-terrorist groups really attract labs to the US.  perhaps instead of spending tax dollars, the courts should be controlled.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Assumptions&amp;asses&amp;suchlike. I really don’t know where this came from, besides being an easy way to call me a liberal, and showing you read the newspaper. A noble attempt, but you know nothing of my politics. Nor do I understand what “eco-terrorist” groups have to do with what you’ve just said, or how “controlling the courts” would do anything to alleviate your concerns, but I’m sure it made sense when you were writing it.</p>
<p>Spare me the rhetoric and namecalling.</p>
<p>I applaud all around that the federal government is not going to be funding stem cell research, but I heartily disagree on the rationale. It has nothing to do with the “culture of life” or whatever the operative term is today. That’s none of the government’s concern; the federal government has no place spending money on research. (Nor subsidizing ‘defense’ research, but we’ll set that aside for the moment) The federal government was granted strictly limited powers and should at no point be allowed to exceed them.</p>
<p>The market can handle funding research, and is doing so.</p>

I am a libertarian that disagrees with the their view on defense.</p>
<p>philodespotos , “The agenda that Bush’s little group of neo"conservative"s promote is certified lunacy”<br>
What were you refering to besides stem cell research veto and funding religious charities.</p>
<p>I don’t read the newspapers.  Show me a war where people gained rights during the war instead of lossing them.  I was talking about controlling the courts awards for medical mal-practice.  I am afraid that rights should be detered unless racial/country-orgin profiling is allowed during wartime.</p>
<p>“The federal government was granted strictly limited powers and should at no point be allowed to exceed them.”<br>
the only way your going to promote this is by strict term limits or even term length, power corrupts thus have people in office as short as possible.</p>

<p>I guess we are still working on stem cell research, but the church and bush are trying to prevent it. And even though bush didn’t support government funding for stem cell research, he also didn’t want it altogether. He made an open statement saying it was wrong and he agreed with the church.</p>

lol nice. Who knows if it was for oil though. Remember what I said before ruler, he's making money on it. Okay I think I beat that horse to death since yous till don't believe me because you think Bush isn't involved in the oil business. :P

<p>It’s better for our stock markets to do badly, in the long run, given the US national debt.[/quote]<br>
So a crash would get us out of dept…quickest solution is hyper-inflation.<br>
The stock market generates cash out of thin air.  We give countries paper dollars for useful products.  They countires usually re-invest the money in us bonds, real estate.  They often get bruned by us in their investments.  Also they usually take the money and invest it in their military which loses its value very very quickly.</p>
<p>Also about the Nasdaq, Greenspan destroyed it.  He saw a bubble and raised rates.  He did it too much and we entered a recesssion.  then came 9-11.  Now its Housing that is the enemy. Central Banks hunt growth.</p>

Osama Bin has a big family, with many ties to the US due to afgansitan war and espically saudi arabia.  I was not aware he was meeting with his brother, however osama’s family doesn’t talk with osama</p>
<p>Oil ouptut from the iraq is still not up to the pre-war times.   not to mention all the oil that got out under the radar, oil for food.</p>
<p>Do you not see that this is economical.  All that money that use to go to Russia, France, and Germany  now flows to US companies.</p>

<p>I don’t read the newspapers.  Show me a war where people gained rights during the war instead of lossing them.  I was talking about controlling the courts awards for medical mal-practice.  I am afraid that rights should be detered unless racial/country-orgin profiling is allowed during wartime.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This didn’t at all respond to my question. I did not ask, “Why are we waging the first war that resulted in limited domestic rights?” Because we aren’t. My question, again, is:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Where in the Constitution does it state that we have <span class="bbcode-i">certain, inalienable</span> rights – unless we are at war, in which case they may be flung out the window as a handful of people in the executive branch see fit?</span></p>
<p>[quote=“ruler, post:28, topic:5935”]“The federal government was granted strictly limited powers and should at no point be allowed to exceed them.”<br>
the only way your going to promote this is by strict term limits or even term length, power corrupts thus have people in office as short as possible.[/quote]</p>
<p>Term limits have nothing to do with this. A 98% incumbency rate in the legislature is frightening and pitiful, sure. That’s more an issue of corrupted election funding than it is of term limits. Publicly funded elections put this to rest quickly and easily. We can easily pay for it by slashing the defense budget heavily.</p>
<p>The real plan here is, God forbid, to actually proceed to put the government back in its place. Which is a very small hole in the corner of our society, performing the menial tasks which were assigned to it by the authors of the foundational document of the entire structure of our government. This should be highly agreeable to everyone in the nation, save the Washington cabal.</p>
<p>[quote=“ruler, post:28, topic:5935”]philodespotos , “The agenda that Bush’s little group of neo"conservative"s promote is certified lunacy”<br>
What were you refering to besides stem cell research veto and funding religious charities.[/quote]</p>
<p>Could it have been rapidly unfettering the executive branch at the expense of a balanced federal government? Foreign policy which apparently has no acquaintance with what it means to deal with “foreigners” or what it means to form rational “policy?” Dismissing all previous legal constraints placed upon our military’s behavior? Attempting to justify a debate about whether torture, “in this case” – because of a freshly redefined legal term – is acceptable, while calling themselves the “protectors of freedom and justice?” Overturning, at the very least, 60 years worth of diplomatic precedent in waging a preemptive war against a country which couldn’t have managed to conquer Luxemburg? Claiming all life to be sacred, shortly to be followed by, “I’d say, uhh, maybe 30,000 civilians have died in this war”? Issuing signing statements at a rate never before heard of, effectively saying, “Sure, Congress passed this law, but I don’t actually have to pay attention to it”? Placing the executive branch <span class="bbcode-i">above the law itself</span>? Discarding the fundamental tenets of Western society?</p>
<p>No, you’re right. Must’ve been stem cells and religious charities.</p>
