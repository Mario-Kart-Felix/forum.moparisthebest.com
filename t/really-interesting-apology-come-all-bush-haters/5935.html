        <p>[quote=“moparisthebest, post:2, topic:5935”]I voted for George W. Bush, and I am glad that I did.</p>
<p>The way I see it, I didnt have a choice, I didnt like either candidate, they both seemed like lousy candidates, so what do you do when somthing like this happens? vote for <span class="bbcode-b">a third party that supports your views</span>.[/quote]<br>
Quote fixed for the sake of prosperity.</p>
<p>That said, I will not apologize for having voted for Bush in 2004. I knew that Bush and his silly compatriots were nefariously evil when he went into office in 2000, and I was just beginning to study politics. I knew that he was batshit insane when I voted for him in 2004. I was fully aware that he would most likely be considered one of the worst presidents the country had ever seen. I was fully aware that it would only get worse the second time around.</p>
<p>The agenda that Bush’s little group of neo"conservative"s promote is certified lunacy. And it is the best thing to happen to this country in ages. The evidence is overwhelming: people only remember that they must exercise their rights when others attempt to eliminate those rights. If you just take a brief look back at the things we have learned since he was elected to his second term, and how the populus has reacted, you will see that this is true.</p>
<p>At the moment, what is bad for America is good for America.</p>
<p>The people must be reminded that we control the government; the government does not control us, no matter how often it may attempt to do so.</p>

<p>Oh em gee, look at everything he did. That was just a small amount of it too. Did you read that in the article Mopar? :)[/quote]<br>
Life isnt perfect Ron. Just becasue he went to war doesnt make him evil. He did what needed to be done. He saw the torture that Saddam was using on his own people. INNOCENT children. Why dont you look at both sides. You are just looking at a biased side which in your mind is correct. What was wrong about kerry? Who knows, I dont apoligize for voting for George Bush. For once, you are very wrong. You cant fucking blame him for katrina. God damnit Ron. It’s not his fault that a hurricane hit there. That gas prices isnt his fault either. He went to war, God forbid we go to war. If we hadnt in WWII, there might be no America. Look back at history. We have always had to go to war to support our freedom. Fuck. Look what our country needed to do! The fought so we could have independence. Dont you fucking dare dimishin what the soldiers are doing for our country. Fuck off.</p>

<p>This argument made absolutely no sense. “Either you are grossly incompetent, or you are …” No, you’re just an idiot.</p>
<p>No one is saying, “The hurricane hit them because they were black,” which is the actual equivalent of your Oklahoma City analogy, despite you having come up with this completely off-point comparison. It is worth noting, of course, that at the OFB, the response was both swift and well-equipped. As it should be.</p>
<p>The point of contention is, rather, that the <span class="bbcode-i">response</span> to Katrina was because the area was predominantly black. I tend to disagree; I think it was a matter of class, and a very successful method to encourage the gentrification that we are witnessing today. But I can disagree without resorting to fallacious drivel that any jackass who attended the second day of logic class can dismantle effortlessly.</p>
<p>Mopar, you very much like to muddy waters by asking others to “grow brains” and by enlightening us with your demonstrations of “the truth,” but you fail miserably every time. Your little comparison was grossly inadequate for anyone who has “grown a brain” and “thought for themselves.”</p>

<p>If we would have killed Bin Laden, a new leader would rise to take his place.  This is a war on TERRORISM, not one man.<br>
Katrina developed into the disaster it was b/c of the lack of response of FEMA, not b/c of what you think is a racist president.</p>
<p>Oh, and a president can only serve for two terms, so he will not be in office again–don’t worry, you will learn all of this once you reach the 7th grade.</p>

<p>ok then mopar tell me this. why is it that it took days and even weeks to get to new orleans when it took less than 24hours to get over seas for the tsunami relief?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>tsuanami relief is just dropping food from the air.  After Katrina passed the water wasn’t that high in the city, people were not through to be in danger.  Keep in mind the people in the tsuanami ravage countries were more fit to live outside than those in New Orleans.  New Orleans is very corrupt and is  welfare state.  Also the water receed after the tsuanami…<br>
I live in Florida and when hurricanes come, FEMA isn’t on the ground for at least 2 days.  And when they do arrive all they do is hand out checks and ice.</p>
<p>According to the muslims we got the hurricane bc we support Isreal.</p>

I voted for George W. Bush, and I am glad that I did.</p>
<p>The way I see it, I didnt have a choice, I didnt like either candidate, they both seemed like lousy candidates, so what do you do when somthing like this happens? vote for <span class="bbcode-b">a third party that supports your views</span>.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Quote fixed for the sake of prosperity.</p>
<p>That said, I will not apologize for having voted for Bush in 2004. I knew that Bush and his silly compatriots were nefariously evil when he went into office in 2000, and I was just beginning to study politics. I knew that he was batshit insane when I voted for him in 2004. I was fully aware that he would most likely be considered one of the worst presidents the country had ever seen. I was fully aware that it would only get worse the second time around.</p>
<p>The agenda that Bush’s little group of neo"conservative"s promote is certified lunacy. And it is the best thing to happen to this country in ages. The evidence is overwhelming: people only remember that they must exercise their rights when others attempt to eliminate those rights. If you just take a brief look back at the things we have learned since he was elected to his second term, and how the populus has reacted, you will see that this is true.</p>
<p>At the moment, what is bad for America is good for America.</p>
<p>The people must be reminded that we control the government; the government does not control us, no matter how often it may attempt to do so.[/quote]<br>
I voted for Bush in 04, I was not old enough in 00.  And about the people losing rights it is normal under war time.  the democrat solution is no invasion, no offense, pure defense.  For defense to work, it will require the complete lost of rights, do you know how difficult defnse is compared to offense?</p>
<p>Oh i bet your one of millions that all cried when bush decided not to fund FEDERAL stem cell research.  Look any company can go out and do research, however the incentive is reduced due to all the health oriented lawsuits daily, also the animal rights/eco-terrorist groups really attract labs to the US.  perhaps instead of spending tax dollars, the courts should be controlled.</p>
<p>How do you want leading the country? someone who decides based on polls like the clintons.  Personally I fear mob-rule.  At least when</p>

No its a chess match, the weapons were moved to Syria.  Also, we are better able to attack Iran now that we have two of its bordering countries.</p>
<p>I wish the US would start increasing Iraq oil production, that would help offset costs.</p>
<p>Iran thinks we wont touch it bc we are scard of high oil.  They think they can do whatever they want.</p>
<p>Can you show me a chart of Bush networth?</p>
<p>Ya i am sure if we didn’t invade Iraq, oil would be cheap and china would not be growing…<br>
<img src="http://zfacts.com/metaPage/lib/zFacts-Gasoline-Price.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I actually think high oil prices will be benifical in the end because they increase supply and increase efficency and result in a glut in the following years.</p>

        <blockquote>Can you show me a chart of Bush networth?</blockquote>
You are the chart master. :P Use your common sense. He's in the oil business, oil businesses have trippled. Only a moron would think he lost money lol. 
<blockquote>I wish the US would start increasing Iraq oil production, that would help offset costs.</blockquote>
Yes.. because we have soo much of it in the USA. lol, we have so little now, and we can only pump so much. Higher gas means we better be looking for an alternate fuel source.
<blockquote>Ya i am sure if we didn't invade Iraq, oil would be cheap and china would not be growing.</blockquote>
Yup! That's true. Invading Iraq was the worst move ever. His family is applauding, but we the citizens still got shafted. Costs about $36 now to fill up my gas tank! That pisses me off.
