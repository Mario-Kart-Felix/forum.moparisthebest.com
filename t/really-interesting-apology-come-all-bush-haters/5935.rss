    <title>Really interesting Apology! - Come all Bush Haters!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/really-interesting-apology-come-all-bush-haters/5935</link>
    <description>For all those who like to read, try reading this. It&#39;s an apology for ever voting for Bush. 

Very funny, and very realistic. If you don&#39;t know what a word means, don&#39;t tune out. Just look it up on dictionary.com :)

New Link: http://www.kabc.com/mcintyre/listingsEntry.asp?ID=432586&amp;PT=McIntyre+in+the+Morning

Quote from the Article.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Katrina, Harriet Myers, The Dubai Port Deal, skyrocketing gas prices, shrinking wages for working people, staggering debt, astronomical foreign debt, outsourcing, open borders, contempt for the opinion of the American people, the war on science, media manipulation, faith based initives, a cavalier attitude toward fundamental freedoms-- this President has run the most arrogant and out-of-touch administration in my lifetime, perhaps, in any American’s lifetime.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Please do not post without reading it first. Enjoy! :)

<p>Other than that anybody’s excuse for not voting for him was because he has a “horse face”. The appearance of the president has nothing to do with how well he can manage the governement. Just in case if you used that as an excuse. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Mopar, all I want to know is, why do you think Kerry would not have been a better president than Bush.</p>

the only way your going to promote this is by strict term limits or even term length, power corrupts thus have people in office as short as possible.[/quote]</p>
<p>Term limits have nothing to do with this. A 98% incumbency rate in the legislature is frightening and pitiful, sure. That’s more an issue of corrupted election funding than it is of term limits. Publicly funded elections put this to rest quickly and easily. We can easily pay for it by slashing the defense budget heavily.</p>
<p>The real plan here is, God forbid, to actually proceed to put the government back in its place. Which is a very small hole in the corner of our society, performing the menial tasks which were assigned to it by the authors of the foundational document of the entire structure of our government.

What were you refering to besides stem cell research veto and funding religious charities.[/quote]</p>
<p>Could it have been rapidly unfettering the executive branch at the expense of a balanced federal government? Foreign policy which apparently has no acquaintance with what it means to deal with “foreigners” or what it means to form rational “policy?” Dismissing all previous legal constraints placed upon our military’s behavior? Attempting to justify a debate about whether torture, “in this case” – because of a freshly redefined legal term – is acceptable, while calling themselves the “protectors of freedom and justice?” Overturning, at the very least, 60 years worth of diplomatic precedent in waging a preemptive war against a country which couldn’t have managed to conquer Luxemburg? Claiming all life to be sacred, shortly to be followed by, “I’d say, uhh, maybe 30,000 civilians have died in this war”? Issuing signing statements at a rate never before heard of, effectively saying, “Sure, Congress passed this law, but I don’t actually have to pay attention to it”? Placing the executive branch <span class="bbcode-i">above the law itself</span>? Discarding the fundamental tenets of Western society?</p>
<p>No, you’re right. Must’ve been stem cells and religious charities.</p>

Osama Bin has a big family, with many ties to the US due to afgansitan war and espically saudi arabia.  I was not aware he was meeting with his brother, however osama’s family doesn’t talk with osama</p>
<p>Oil ouptut from the iraq is still not up to the pre-war times.   not to mention all the oil that got out under the radar, oil for food.</p>
<p>Do you not see that this is economical.  All that money that use to go to Russia, France, and Germany  now flows to US companies.</p>

So a crash would get us out of dept…quickest solution is hyper-inflation.<br>
The stock market generates cash out of thin air.  We give countries paper dollars for useful products.  They countires usually re-invest the money in us bonds, real estate.  They often get bruned by us in their investments.  Also they usually take the money and invest it in their military which loses its value very very quickly.</p>
<p>Also about the Nasdaq, Greenspan destroyed it.  He saw a bubble and raised rates.  He did it too much and we entered a recesssion.  then came 9-11.  Now its Housing that is the enemy. Central Banks hunt growth.</p>

lol nice. Who knows if it was for oil though. Remember what I said before ruler, he's making money on it. Okay I think I beat that horse to death since yous till don't believe me because you think Bush isn't involved in the oil business. :P

We don’t get to prattle on about being “defenders of liberty” and such things if we’re willing to curtail rights because we’re “at war.” Wartime is when they must be most unfettered.</p>

<p>I don’t read the newspapers.  Show me a war where people gained rights during the war instead of lossing them.  I was talking about controlling the courts awards for medical mal-practice.  I am afraid that rights should be detered unless racial/country-orgin profiling is allowed during wartime.</p>
<p>“The federal government was granted strictly limited powers and should at no point be allowed to exceed them.”<br>
the only way your going to promote this is by strict term limits or even term length, power corrupts thus have people in office as short as possible.</p>

<p>You just kicked right wing, conservative, too religious, pruny pilgrim ass! Nice!</p>
<p>I totally agree with those statements. Althought I did support stemcell research. Every other country is doing it and advancing in the medical area and we’re losing touch because in America the right wing christians are saying, No! Stem cell research is wrong! Just wrong! I think the people need to wake up and take a breath of reality.</p>
<p>Once we said that if God wanted man to fly he would give us wings and now the pope flies. In another 10 years we’ll begin stem cell research and get rid of the church bullshit (hopefully). :rolleyes:</p>

lol, yeah I was wondering about that chart, per haps he was trying to show Bush’s dctatorship over Clinton’s democracy with a chart of the Nasdaq to show how much better we are now?</p>
<p>Even though in Clinton’s administration, the Nasdaq was about 1500 points higher. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>I applaud all around that the federal government is not going to be funding stem cell research, but I heartily disagree on the rationale. It has nothing to do with the “culture of life” or whatever the operative term is today. That’s none of the government’s concern; the federal government has no place spending money on research. (Nor subsidizing ‘defense’ research, but we’ll set that aside for the moment) The federal government was granted strictly limited powers and should at no point be allowed to exceed them.</p>
<p>The market can handle funding research, and is doing so.</p>

Yup! That’s true. Invading Iraq was the worst move ever. His family is applauding, but we the citizens still got shafted. Costs about $36 now to fill up my gas tank! That pisses me off.<br>

Damn, how big is your gas tank :S? It costs about 9 euros to fill up my moped’s tank, which is 6.5 fricken litres! Gas is about 1.4-1.5 euros per litre here in Finland. Talk about gas prizes…[/quote]<br>

He was in the oil business i think over 15 years ago.  If he tripled his money due to the war the media would be all over it…  I don’t even know if he owns oil stocks.[/quote]<br>
Are you kidding me??? It’s a known fact, his family is in the oil industry. The whole family owns Oil wells and everything. Oh ya, wake up from the American dream, the news is controlled. Mark my words, him making money on oil, will be all over the news in like 2 years when he leaves. They exclude a lot of things in the news… If you read the apology, which I doubt you did, then you would have learned something. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

I wish the US would start increasing Iraq oil production, that would help offset costs.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yes… because we have soo much of it in the USA. lol, we have so little now, and we can only pump so much. Higher gas means we better be looking for an alternate fuel source.[/quote]<br>
their is alot of oil in the gulf, off cali coast, off florida coast, in alaska that is not being tapped due to enviromental laws.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yeah yeah I know we have oil, but we’re running out. We can have small amounts of oil in 1000s diff places, but the point is… we are seriously running out. In the next 10-20 years, gasoline will be gone. In the next 5 years (I’m hoping), we will switch to a different source of energy.</p>
