</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well Windows is slow to begin with.  Mac loads fast even with its ‘translucent slide in fade out 3d mesmerizing useless environment.’<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>It is easy to load fast when all of your hardware is proprietary and therefore don’t have to worry about these little things called ‘drivers’</p>
<p>I would never buy a mac because I can’t build one, you can’t upgrade them, you have to buy them and in a few years throw them away because they are old, did I even mention the price? They are more overpriced than Dell.</p>
<p>I have used windows since version 3.1, all the way up through XP SP2 (I tried vista as well, hated it) I know windows like the back of my hand, there is hardly anything that is doable that I can’t do or figure out.  However after just a week (yes, give it 7 full days) of using kubuntu I was hooked on linux, and I have never looked back.</p>
<p>Linux, because it is open source, gives you customization unrivaled by anything else.</p>
<p>Want to run an OS on your PS2? your Wii? your xbox? hell even your gamecube? Sure, simply compile linux for your architecture and run with it.  Want to run something not open source on anything besides the x86 architecture? You my friend are shit out of luck.</p>
<p>Don’t like the way your window manager looks? have you tried KDE, GNOME, Xfce, fluxbox or one of the other many managers there are out there? Still don’t like them? Write your own.</p>
<p>Having problems with some bug that you or someone else has discovered? If your OS is not open source have fun twiddling your thumbs while some lacky at apple or microsoft takes their sweet time getting around to it while you are left blowing in the wind.  If you are running linux chances are someone else has already written a patch and submitted it to the kernel devs, if not you, yes even you, can write one.</p>
<p>Worried about security (see above as well)? With proprietary OS’s you have to trust the software engineers to have locked everything up, and you have to trust security companies that they have checked all loopholes.  With open source code you can rest assured that thousands upon thousands of independent people from all over the world have reviewed the code, it is secure.</p>
<p>Any questions?[/quote]</p>
<p>uh, treating closed source development like it is the antichrist is stupid. Open source and closed source both have their merits.</p>
<p>how many <em>normal</em> users of linux(not kernel developers or package managers) out there have actually ever really looked at the kernel source/written a driver/patched a bug in the kernel? a very, very small amount.</p>
<p>windows can be reskinned completly, and, i’m guessing os x can too. hell, everything is configurable.</p>
<p>proprietary hardware is good in a way, without it you get huge amounts of driver issues - and with that comes security issues, as demonstrated with the recent bug in an ati driver that allowed a guy to access the vista kernel and load unsigned drivers(see: purple pill) - that affect all modern OS’s.</p>
<p>mac, windows and unix-like os’s all have their niches and they all specialise in different things, trying to compare them is like trying to compare apples and oranges.</p>
<p>sigh.</p>

Windows may take long time to load with all it’s gui trinkets, but take a look at mac! You can’t even strip it down. In windows you can set the theme to 95 windows, in mac you’re stuck with the translucent slide in fade out 3d mesmirizing useless enviroment.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Well Windows is slow to begin with.  Mac loads fast even with its ‘translucent slide in fade out 3d mesmerizing useless environment.’[/quote]</p>
<p>It is easy to load fast when all of your hardware is proprietary and therefore don’t have to worry about these little things called ‘drivers’</p>
<p>I would never buy a mac because I can’t build one, you can’t upgrade them, you have to buy them and in a few years throw them away because they are old, did I even mention the price? They are more overpriced than Dell.</p>
<p>I have used windows since version 3.1, all the way up through XP SP2 (I tried vista as well, hated it) I know windows like the back of my hand, there is hardly anything that is doable that I can’t do or figure out.  However after just a week (yes, give it 7 full days) of using kubuntu I was hooked on linux, and I have never looked back.</p>
<p>Linux, because it is open source, gives you customization unrivaled by anything else.</p>
<p>Want to run an OS on your PS2? your Wii? your xbox? hell even your gamecube? Sure, simply compile linux for your architecture and run with it.  Want to run something not open source on anything besides the x86 architecture? You my friend are shit out of luck.</p>
<p>Don’t like the way your window manager looks? have you tried KDE, GNOME, Xfce, fluxbox or one of the other many managers there are out there? Still don’t like them? Write your own.</p>
<p>Having problems with some bug that you or someone else has discovered? If your OS is not open source have fun twiddling your thumbs while some lacky at apple or microsoft takes their sweet time getting around to it while you are left blowing in the wind.  If you are running linux chances are someone else has already written a patch and submitted it to the kernel devs, if not you, yes even you, can write one.</p>
<p>Worried about security (see above as well)? With proprietary OS’s you have to trust the software engineers to have locked everything up, and you have to trust security companies that they have checked all loopholes.  With open source code you can rest assured that thousands upon thousands of independent people from all over the world have reviewed the code, it is secure.</p>
<p>Any questions?</p>
