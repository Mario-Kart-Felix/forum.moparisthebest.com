The production booth has been put in an old limo bus. &quot;It&#39;s like any new technological innovation. You don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to perform until you flip your switch,&quot; mentioned Gregg Champion, vice president of programming. &quot;We flipped the switch and the darn thing worked.

The consultation only confirmed what Davis previously knew: he has absolutely no structural or tendon damage, and being off the field seems to be the primary treatment. &quot;Obviously he is in pain, so when he is ready to go, he&#39;ll begin practicing and get ready to try out,&quot; Broncos coach Robert Shanahan said. &quot;The bottom line is this individual can&#39;t push away yet and we don&#39;t know when he&#39;ll manage to do that.&quot; After watching his teammates training, Davis smiled at reporters but declined to talk about his or her injury, saying there was clearly nothing new to discuss.

He missed the final 12 games associated with last season as a result of torn anterior cruciate ligament in the right knee, and he has missed six games this year because of a sprained left ankle as well as the lingering leg difficulty. &quot;It&#39;s tough for me because I know how bad he or she wants to be around,&quot; fullback Howard Griffith said. &quot;I&#39;m in their corner and I know at some point, he&#39;s going to get back out there around.&quot; The Broncos (7-4) have won five regarding six games with no Davis, thanks in part on the strong play associated with rookie Mike Anderson, who&#39;s run for 776 meters in seven games as the featured rear. Davis will continue to work on conditioning, and Shanahan can only wait patiently for their star running back to give him good news. &quot;I believe it&#39;s always tough if it&#39;s your livelihood to look out there and participate in,&quot; Shanahan said. &quot;I recognize it&#39;s frustrating, but there is nothing you can do over it except keep on residing in shape from a cardio standpoint and perform the rehab and hopefully it&#39;ll get well.Inches(C)2000 The Associated Press.
