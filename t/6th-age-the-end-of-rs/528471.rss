&lt;blockquote&gt;This was on the video on youtube it was made 2 days ago, and it&#39;s been deleted or taken down, not sure. By this terrorist or whatever group. 30k watched this...

This is the first step into making RuneScape more corrupt.

We have sent a email to this so called &quot;RuneScape&quot; #1 game of the world. If RuneScape fails to comply we&#39;ll simply make all their J Mods (silentc0re, regicial, so wreck3d), and player moderators pay for their lack of understanding. What we plan on doing is the first step of Java determinations. What we do and what we&#39;ll do to Runescape, will be written all over their 6th age the ending of RuneScape. What we plan on doing is attacking them without them noticing. With a few loops, constants, and variables will be enough to log on all their player accounts and selling them.

You think you don&#39;t have to worry about us. But trust us we know what&#39;re doing and we know more Java than Java knows itself. We will make you pay for the lack of updates on EOC and Rs07. If you&#39;re going to simply mute/delete this thread good luck, because with all these loops I added will buy me enough time to stop you for going on your servers and website for a few hours, and by the time you come back We&#39;ll have taken down everything. What comes next is Red and is liquid, you should know what that is. If you think we&#39;re just trolls, simply try to find all the loop holes we created on your so called #1 source. We also implemented injections and loops on your failed html5 beta engine crap. 

YOU HAVE 24 HOURS TO NEGOTIATE. This all starts on August 21 2013 12:00 A.M Jagex Studios floor 2.

This is the end RuneScape. You have 24 hours or you&#39;ll never see your JMod friends again.

If you&#39;re going to IP us good luck, because with our powerful expensive technology, we were able to hack numerous accounts and set or IP to theirs. So have fun IP banning us or muting us, who knows if you mute me, this can result in muting hundreds maybe thousands.

What we plan on doing is the first step of Java determinations. What we do and what we’ll do to Runescape, will be written all over their 6th age the ending of RuneScape. What we plan on doing is attacking them without them noticing. With a few loops, constants, and variables will be enough to log on all their player accounts and selling them.</p>
<p>You think you don’t have to worry about us. But trust us we know what’re doing and we know more Java than Java knows itself. We will make you pay for the lack of updates on EOC and Rs07. If you’re going to simply mute/delete this thread good luck, because with all these loops I added will buy me enough time to stop you for going on your servers and website for a few hours, and by the time you come back We’ll have taken down everything. What comes next is Red and is liquid, you should know what that is. If you think we’re just trolls, simply try to find all the loop holes we created on your so called <span class="hashtag">#1</span> source. We also implemented injections and loops on your failed html5 beta engine crap.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE 24 HOURS TO NEGOTIATE. This all starts on August 21 2013 12:00 A.M Jagex Studios floor 2.</p>
<p>This is the end RuneScape. You have 24 hours or you’ll never see your JMod friends again.</p>
<p>If you’re going to IP us good luck, because with our powerful expensive technology, we were able to hack numerous accounts and set or IP to theirs. So have fun IP banning us or muting us, who knows if you mute me, this can result in muting hundreds maybe thousands.</p>
