    <title>Make a player wear an item do a command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-a-player-wear-an-item-do-a-command/364306</link>
    <description>Okay, I&#39;m trying to make a god command for normal players.  I&#39;m trying to make it where they have to wear the wings to do god mode.  I&#39;ve tried wearid or something but it doesn&#39;t work.  [code]        if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;god&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights == 0 &amp;&amp;  What goes here? == 6543) {
            startAnimation(1500);
            playerSE = 1501;
            playerSEW = 1851;
            playerSER = 1851;
            playerSEA = 1851;
            playerEnergy = 100;
            playerLevel[3] = 120;
            sendFrame126(playerEnergy + &quot;%&quot;, 149);
            sM(&quot;God mode on&quot;);
            updateRequired = true;
            appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
		}
		else
		{
	sM(&quot;You need to bew wearing Wings to do god mode.&quot;);
		}[/code]</description>
