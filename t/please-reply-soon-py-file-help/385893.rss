    <description>Okay guys, I know someone here has their smarty pants on!

My issue: My server, Project Insanity base, is run off of .py files for objects, and such. My computer does not read these for some reason? So I changed it so my computer would read it with adobe, this still did not work. I need help please!(:

Without it I cannot change shops or add objects anywhere. I kinda&#39; need this?
