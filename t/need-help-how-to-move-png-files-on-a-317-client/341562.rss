    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-how-to-move-png-files-on-a-317-client/341562</link>
    <description>Well basicly, ive got a problem with this on a 317 client.
This is the melee tab, its perfect but the others expect for the mage one. Are not good, allright take a look at this[img]http://www.habbuls.site90.net/stats.png[/img]
Thats the stat one it does go the same at the others expect for melee and mage.
This is the melee one.

Does anyone know how to put the ones that are not correct on the right place?

Anyways thanks.</description>
