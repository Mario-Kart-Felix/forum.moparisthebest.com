<p>I’m pretty sure the amount of people that are actually admin is going to be pretty small, so corruption should not happen, and if anything does go wrong there will be punishment to pay.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure Ollie is going to be given some sort of access so I really doubt he would be apart of something that he thinks would ruin his image in the RSC scene.</p>
<p>A public beta is rumored to be released hopefully in two weeks time, and their official website to be released within the week.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Pompano21, post:235, topic:447392”]This is what I have to say…</p>
<p>Me being immature, yes in the past(1+ year ago). I admit I was pretty immature at times because I joined an immature mopar community, not naming everyone here but in general mopar rsc section is very immature. I took a 1 year break from it, to work on a business and make something of my self. I am back and I have a completely different mind set, not to boast or anything but my business has turned into an amazing success where I am at that level where I can afford a full time developer,server,advertisement and whatever else it needs to actually be something fun.</p>
<p>I have already invested 3 weeks worth of pay into a developer outside of RSC and I don’t see how anyone could think I would do something stupid to just waste that money. I loved RSC when I was younger and I honestly do just want to bring forward a server where we can advance the development and work towards the goal of actually replicating the content on RSC and having something stable. If people actually spoke to me in PM on IRC or got to know me, you would actually know the true me.</p>
<p>I don’t really post here anymore as most of the time you are in a losing battle because people are happy to quote each other 24/7 arguing and it going no where. I am staying more behind the scenes on this project. I already have stated that I want the spawn commands removed, setstats and so on. I want all staff to be ranked how Jagex did it. Mod in front of the name. I don’t want the server to be something power hungry, I want it to be a team effort. Support or don’t support it but I don’t see why there is need to keep trashing topics like this with arguments because it gets tiresome.[/quote]You have become less immature, sure, but you (along with pretty much everyone else on this site) are far from what I would consider mature.</p>
<p>As for the rest, you’re pretty much just confirming what I said.</p>
<p>Anyway, I didn’t intend to start an argument, I just found the line of crap KO9 was serving hilarious.</p>

<p>This is what I have to say…</p>
<p>Me being immature, yes in the past(1+ year ago). I admit I was pretty immature at times because I joined an immature mopar community, not naming everyone here but in general mopar rsc section is very immature. I took a 1 year break from it, to work on a business and make something of my self. I am back and I have a completely different mind set, not to boast or anything but my business has turned into an amazing success where I am at that level where I can afford a full time developer,server,advertisement and whatever else it needs to actually be something fun.</p>
<p>I have already invested 3 weeks worth of pay into a developer outside of RSC and I don’t see how anyone could think I would do something stupid to just waste that money. I loved RSC when I was younger and I honestly do just want to bring forward a server where we can advance the development and work towards the goal of actually replicating the content on RSC and having something stable. If people actually spoke to me in PM on IRC or got to know me, you would actually know the true me.</p>
<p>I don’t really post here anymore as most of the time you are in a losing battle because people are happy to quote each other 24/7 arguing and it going no where. I am staying more behind the scenes on this project. I already have stated that I want the spawn commands removed, setstats and so on. I want all staff to be ranked how Jagex did it. Mod in front of the name. I don’t want the server to be something power hungry, I want it to be a team effort. Support or don’t support it but I don’t see why there is need to keep trashing topics like this with arguments because it gets tiresome.<br>

        <p>[quote=“waj, post:255, topic:447392”]Never said I didn’t get it, obviously your the one who doesn’t get it.</p>
<p>I said I don’t see where people said anything to you, not that I don’t understand what your saying?[/quote]It’s blatantly obvious that you don’t get it… Anyway, I’m not going to waste my time looking for posts where I was insulted; that’s just retarded. If you want to find the posts, then go look at any argument I’ve had that’s lasted more than a few posts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what difference does it make if I call people idiots? Snoopy is a prime example of the entire community talking shit about him, yet he really hasn’t talked shit about anyone else. So, why don’t you bitch at everyone else about it? Oh ya, because it doesn’t help your argument…</p>
<p>[quote=“waj, post:255, topic:447392”]There is no point replying with some massive wall of text trying to out smart the person your arguing with.[/quote]That’s like saying there is no point is playing RSC… I do it because I enjoy it, just like you play RSC because you enjoy it. The difference is that I actually need to use my brain, and don’t spend nearly as much time as you do playing RSC.</p>
<p>[quote=“waj, post:255, topic:447392”]Like ffs, your old enough to be most of are fathers, grow up a little.[/quote]That’s simply not true, as most people that play RSC are 18+… Furthermore, what does age have to do with anything? Most of you are adults now, so stop trying to pull that age bullshit.</p>
