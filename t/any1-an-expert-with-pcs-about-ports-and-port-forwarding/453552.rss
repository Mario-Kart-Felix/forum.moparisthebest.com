    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any1-an-expert-with-pcs-about-ports-and-port-forwarding/453552</link>
    <description>right i have just upgraded from 30 mb to 60 meg and got the new super hub, the only problem i have with the super hub is the PORTS, everything esle is ok. i&#39;ll explian my problem with the ports now. i host mine craft servers and runescape private server. so the ports i open are 5555, 43594, 43595, and the mine craft one ( witch i changed to 255)  and everything was ok till one day my whole net and cable goes off, so i rang vm and they sent a new moden out ect, i installed it, everything was working again, the ports were open easy to forward. then i got sick of being on 30 meg internet so i upgrated to the 60 meg, ( it&#39;s only been installed for 2 days)  in that time just to get &quot;ANY&quot; port chcker site to say port 80 is open i have tryed : dmz dnz static ip, reseting the moden, puting it just into moden mode, and ive tryed taken upnp off and  puting it on and nothing seems to work for opening ports. so i thought well is it just me or is it every1 ive been ooking around and it seems to be only me. so i thought. i went to my sister house who is also on 30 meg with superhub. her ports are closed on 8 diffrent port checker sites. o i thought i&#39;d test my dads and yet again his is all closed to.  so im now thinking has VM stopped all porting incoming. ive rang them and they said its not a fault on there side its mine.  so how would it be mine if 3 diffrent people with 3 diffrent post codes all have closed ports... HOW THE HELL IS IT MY FAULT.      i guess you et my point now   any1 able to help please eply and let me know     maybe it is my fault with a setting on my computer but ive formated it 3 times and stil no luck ...     any1 have any ideas ?



ps sorry about this being messy ect its just a post i copyed from virgim media&#39;s forums that i typed a week ago and had no reply on there so trying here.</description>
