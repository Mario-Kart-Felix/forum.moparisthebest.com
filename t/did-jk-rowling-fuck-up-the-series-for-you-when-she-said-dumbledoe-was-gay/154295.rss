Also, it wasn’t mentioned on the news, and if I wasn’t a fan, and didn’t go out of my way to find out Harry Potter news, I probably would have never known.</p>

<p>Harry’s final catechism takes him no closer to any real truth at the end of the seventh book, the moral dilemma is always altruistic martyrdom vs. selfish cowardice, and the plot is so convoluted by the end of the series it reads more like an L. Frank Baum acid trip then a novel.</p>

No, cause i didn’t read it. The story was too childish for my taste.<br>

<p>Actually everything appears in a very childish way which doesn’t appeal to me. If you compare with, say David Eddings or Terry Pratchett books you can see the difference immediately.</p>

<p>Harry’s final catechism takes him no closer to any real truth at the end of the seventh book, the moral dilemma is always altruistic martyrdom vs. selfish cowardice, and the plot is so convoluted by the end of the series it reads more like an L. Frank Baum acid trip then a novel.</p>
