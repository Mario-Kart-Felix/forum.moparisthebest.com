    <title>Moving Objects?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moving-objects/219080</link>
    <description>I am currently making a server and whenever i seem to move objects for people to train or for people to stay within a location it seems to lag my server when more then 2 people are in the area.

Can someone please tell me how to make it so that they are not laggy. I am currently using Chiefscape And 100% editing it.

Also does anyone have the code to make people around me bow like if i walk by them they immediatly start bowing..

Thanks For Your Help

Sincerely,
