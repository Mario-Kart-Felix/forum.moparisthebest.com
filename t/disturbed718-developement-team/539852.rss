    <description>Hello,

 I&#39;m Tyler, and I&#39;m one of the proud Owners/Founders of Disturbed718. The others are Avex, and Blake (Blake&#39;s not registered on Rune-Server). There were some fall outs with our last developer, and I&#39;ll be honest with you, I&#39;m no saint when it comes to Java Code. I can do a lot of the small things, but I can&#39;t completely write code from scratch. 

Anyways, onto the good stuff. 
[u]
What&#39;s going to happen:[/u]

We DO NOT half ass things. Everything will be done clean, and as we say. The reason I&#39;m saying this is because not one developer we&#39;ve had has wanted to do things the way we want. You will do things how we want them done, although you will have your say obviously. I&#39;m not trying to sound strict, but no one else has got the catch in the past. You will be editing in a Drop Box, you will not have VPS access until you are 100% trusted by me, Avex, and Blake. No exceptions. I&#39;m sounding like a dick right now, but you&#39;ll come to realize me nor the other staff members are this way. I&#39;m just being straight with everyone.
[u]

How will we know you&#39;re what you say you are?:[/u]

You need to have some way to show us that you&#39;re the real deal, and not some slacker. You will be able to prove this to us in a trial if all necessary.

[u]Other details:[/u]

We&#39;re going to be using a Rune-Evo source. Sound&#39;s shitty now, yes, but this source has been thoroughly worked on, and can be turned into something great. It&#39;s got many features, although it&#39;s not quite what we EXACTLY want. Thing&#39;s can be changed, and will be changed. 


If you wish to join, please private message me, or add my Skype @ Tyler.Canada1. Me, you, and Avex will be talking in a Skype Call. YOU NEED to be able to talk, even if it&#39;s through your phone. YOU MUST BE EXPERIENCED, DO NOT BOTHER IF YOU&#39;RE NOT, WE WILL KNOW.</description>
