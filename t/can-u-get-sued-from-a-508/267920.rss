<p>Even if it were illegal, and there was a chance that you could be sued, I’m almost positive you’d still try for a 508. So what’s the point in even asking.</p>

<p>Both Failure.</p>
<p>Mopar does not “have your back”. If they get sued, basically their ganna go AMF.<br>
(Audios Mother F…)</p>
<p>You can get sued for anything, and JaGeX will most likely win if you don’t have TOS set up.<br>
Everything todo with “Private servers” is sue-able.<br>
JaGeX didn’t release the source code for us to take and download, We found the cache and dled and started making it our own.<br>
Still not our work, JaGeX made it first and slapped a CopyRight on it.<br>
So, Yeah.</p>
<p>T.O.S-Terms of Service.<br>
TOS is that little screen you see before you enter MoparScape, the one you have to type “yes” on and click enter.<br>
Yeah, that prevents JaGeX from legally looking at MoparScape. In a court case, MoparScape would most likely win because of it. The fact that JaGeX wasn’t supposed to be viewing it, and did anyways disregarding the TOS, would prevent them from winning the case.</p>

Yes they do, they can look at your hard drive.<br>

<p>Haha; if Jagex looked at my hard drive I would defiantly counter-sue them.</p>
<p>People overestimate the power of Jagex, because they cannot legally search your hard drive without a search warrant; it is just like any other piece of property, and they have no higher authority than you. (I am of course referring to the U.S laws and constitution, and if they wish to hold a trial in the property of the U.S then they shall abide the law of the land.)[/quote]</p>
