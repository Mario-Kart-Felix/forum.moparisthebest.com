    <title>[508] Grand Exchange, keep or disable?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-grand-exchange-keep-or-disable/458182</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;m debating with my server co-owner if we should keep the Grand Exchange or not.

He says we should remove it because it apparently helped to kill the Runescape community and is a bad idea for a server which is going to be community based.

I say we should keep it because of from what I&#39;ve seen, a GE is almost an expected feature in a 508, people see a server much featureless without the GE and will most likely take a little less interest in it.

Any opinions?</description>

              <p>Also, dude don’t ever take criticism about your server from developers.  Take it from the players who play servers 24/7 and don’t even care how the servers are being ran on.  Developers do not know what the players want, or what really brings a ton of players.  Developers just want to flaunt their work.  Do what most of your players like.  Ask your players, or even ask other owners of big servers.</p>

I personally think that sort of thing is a sign of a bad economy, whereas you find it to be a good thing. I think that it encourages scamming (or taking advantage of) the uneducated, which I don’t really support. Both have pro’s and cons of course.</p>

              <p>An idea I’ve had:</p>
<p>I don’t use 508+'s so GE isn’t an option, but instead of pressing sell and waiting for it to find somebody buying, why not have an interface where you can view every item that is buying bought/sold, if you have an item that someone if looking to buy, you can press a button and sell it to him for the price he has listed. Vise versa for selling.</p>

If your just going to set the prices for an item on the grand exchange and expect to not change them, then yes your economy will be ruined. It will be a lot of work if you choose to keep it. Anyways it’s probally not even your GE, probally came with what you downloaded lol</p>

              <p>So, I’m debating with my server co-owner if we should keep the Grand Exchange or not.</p>
<p>He says we should remove it because it apparently helped to kill the Runescape community and is a bad idea for a server which is going to be community based.</p>
<p>I say we should keep it because of from what I’ve seen, a GE is almost an expected feature in a 508, people see a server much featureless without the GE and will most likely take a little less interest in it.</p>
<p>Any opinions?</p>
