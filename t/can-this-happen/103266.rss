              <p>[quote=“manillajones, post:1, topic:103337”]yes basicly hamachi is like a big network for communicating with ppl, just open hamachi and type in your ip ( make sure your server is runnin)<br>
in the server up and user name and pass and tell your friend swhat ip your on and they can connect…</p>
<p>p.s. if this works, give me rep++ ive been so generous and helpful and no one has givein me rep[/quote]</p>

Then Make Lots Of Minigames, And Someone May Rep You</p>
