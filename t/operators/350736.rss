    <description>I&#39;m going to try to explain some of the java operators in this tutorial for newer members.
If you are the kind of person that wants to be spoonfed, and given copy &amp; paste tutorials, I suggest you look at some other threads.

Let&#39;s start.

[b]Equality[/b]
[code]
==	Equal
!=	Not Equal
&gt;	Greater than
&gt;=	Greater than/Equal
&lt;	Less than
&lt;=	Less/Equal
[/code]

This is pretty straight forward. They can be used in RSPS development in many ways.
One of the most common is in &#39;Commands&#39; like this:
[code]
if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Command&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights == 1){
sM(&quot;Command&quot;);
}
[/code]

Ignore that [code]if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Command&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights[/code] bit right there for now, let&#39;s analyze this.
[code]if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Command&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights == 1){[/code]
The [code]== 1[/code] means that you need 1 &#39;playerRight&#39; to use the command.

Now, what if I said [code]!=[/code] that would mean only if your &#39;playerRights&#39; are [b]not[/b] 1, you can use the command.

Now, what if I said [code]&gt;[/code] that would mean only if my &#39;playerRights&#39; were [b]greater than[/b] 1, I could use the command.

Now, what if I said [code]&gt;=[/code] that would mean only if my &#39;playerRights&#39; were [b]greater than [i][u]or[/u][/i] equal to[/b] 1, I could use the command.

Now, what if I said [code]&lt;[/code] that would mean only if my &#39;playerRights&#39; were [b]less than[/b] 1, I could use the command, you may think, &quot;isn&#39;t that the same as != 1?&quot; no, it&#39;s not, because that is if it isn&#39;t 1, it could be 2 and work. With &lt;, it has to be [b]less[/b] than 1.

Now, what if I said [code]&lt;=[/code] that would mean only if my &#39;playerRights&#39; were [b]less than [i][u]or[/u][/i] equal to[/b] 1, I could use the command.

Very simple, and I hope I explained it well, shall we move on?

[b]Conditional[/b]
[code]
&amp;&amp; And
|| Or
[/code]
These can be used a lot too, let&#39;s refer to the command again.
[code]
if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Command&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights == 1){
sM(&quot;Command&quot;);
}
[/code]
Now, let&#39;s think. What if I wanted the command to be for players with playerRights of 1, or 2?
[code]
if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Command&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights == 1 || playerRights == 2){
sM(&quot;Command&quot;);
}
[/code]
That would make the command available to players with playerRights 1 OR 2, simple right?

Now, this part is pretty easy.
[code]
if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Command&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights == 1){
sM(&quot;Command&quot;);
}
[/code]
Did you see that [b]&amp;&amp;[/b]? lets break this down in english.
[code]if command is (&quot;Command&quot;) and playerRights are one[/code]
The code will execute, the code will not execute if you do not have playerRights equal to 1.
Simple stuff right?

[b]Others[/b]
There are a lot of different ones, but I&#39;m not going to explain them, because they don&#39;t really have any use in private servers (to the average person trying to make their first server).


There, I have contributed to the community.
I realize it looks ugly looking at all that text, but read it if you want to learn.

[b]Ternary:[/b]
[code]? :[/code]

[code]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;ternary&quot;)) {
        String message = playerRights &gt; 1 ? 
				&quot;If your player rights are bigger than one, it will&quot; +
			                &quot;return this message!&quot; :
                                                                &quot;Otherwise, it will return this!&quot;;
		sendMessage(message);
}[/code]


[b]URNARY:[/b]
[code]
!     	Most important one IMO, switches a boolean (false = true, true = false)
+ 	Unary positive operator (Please tell me you understand postive and negative integers...)
++  	Unary adding operator (+1 OMG MATH!)
- 	Unary negative operator
--    	Unary subtracting operator (-1 MORE MATH)
[/code]

I think they&#39;re pretty straight forward, but if you need me to post commands with examples, please tell me.</description>
