The whole idea of Excalibur is not to recreate past memories from RuneScape when it was in
the 2006-2007 era(The one that most people crave), however the goal of this is to create
new memories, ones that will last a lifetime the same as RuneScape has done. So instead of
just copying what RuneScape has done, we will also be adding new ideas and twists to the skills
that just add more to do to the game! Everything that is accomplished will be for you, the players.
We will be hoping to start development as soon as possible, and we hope that we can get a beta 
started asap aswell. We will not rush development as that will take time away from us to perfect
the server.

Remember, if you&#39;re here to apply, we are a non-profit group, meaning that donations, pay to play,
etc. are not going to be put into play, and you will be working whenever you wish, on your own time.

Here is the layout:

What position do you want:
How long have you been programming Java:
What time zone are you in?(Ex. UTC/GMT -6 hours):
Why do you want to become part of this server?:
On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate yourself:
Is there anything else you&#39;d like to add:
