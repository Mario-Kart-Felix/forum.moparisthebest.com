    <description>Ok. I need a few questions answered, before I start working on my project for my server lol, i need to know the following answers to these questions:

1. Isn&#39;t this illegal if Jagex finds out were doing this?
2. How did we even get the source codes?
3. Is it possible for Jagex to sue us if they find out?</description>

<p>1.Its not illegal at all lol, because we are using our own codes, only way it would be illegal is if we were modifying their clients, which we have done otherwise we wouldn’t of been able to logon to our servers.</p>

<p>Yeah smart people for the basics (which are actually hardest part but these are 100% neccessary for server to run properly), nearly all other codes use these smart people’s code, for example my ancient magicks, the inStream stuff is in stream.java or misc.java, and the smart people coded that stuff and also coded cryption <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>No they can’t sue us for servers, but they can for modifying their clients.</p>
