    <title>New home, Hangout, edge pk, and new jad</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-home-hangout-edge-pk-and-new-jad/262450</link>
    <description> Ok, well since A moderator locked my last one because it was &#39;useless&#39; I&#39;ll make a new one. And this one will have details.


  Ok, my first topic is my new home area here is an image: 

[IMG]http://i41.tinypic.com/fth5xu.jpg[/img]

I coded the home area ground up. Took about 5 minutes, but it&#39;s still in development. :) And remember, when my source is done, I plan to release it.

 Ok next is my unfinished Hangout

It&#39;s still in coding because for some odd reason it wont let me make it a safe zone so...I need to fix that.


 Next is my new edge pk place. Mod Allstar originally coded this...but I added a little bit. so I claim SOME credit. All i did was add a bank booth and pking shop and well of course replace PK box with it. (I personally didn&#39;t like the old pkbox. I thought it was time for a little change.)

**ment to say bank booth Sorry.**
        Well, those were my Server developments, Tell me if I did good :)

  OK, guys I finished the hangout, Sort of, you see, I need to spawn more NPCs, that will help it. Oh, and guys, it would really help if you rep me. I&#39;m not forcing you to, just wishing you would. Thanks,

 **NOTE: i&#39;m removing the home pic and re-doing it, it advertises my server. For the moparscape staff to see this, please I just want to let you know i&#39;m taking care of it.**</description>
