    <title>[508] How to genorate ints for hard coding items</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-how-to-genorate-ints-for-hard-coding-items/270876</link>
    <description>ok well this was requested for me to post how to do it

And iv really never understood why people do not know how to do this it is the easiest thing to do ever lol

First off:
do this tut

http://www.rune-server.org/showthread.php?t=126125

it just tells you the basics in doing the hard coding

first off this is what the ints do
[code]
anInt389 - modelRotation1
anInt336 - model zoom
anInt395 - model rotation 2
anInt375 - value
anInt347 - male sleave
aRSString_362 - item name
anInt330 - inventory/drop model
aShortArray332 - originalModelColors
aShortArray342 - modifiedModelColors
anInt348 - adjust model contrast
anInt363 - adjust model brightness
aBoolean366 - stackable
aRSStringArray369 - groundActions
aBoolean371 - membersItem
anInt383 - team
anInt385 - certTemplateID
anInt391 - modelOffset2
anInt358 - modelOffset1
anInt347 - maleExtraModelID//Some items have additional models such a Karils chest these additionModels are usually shoulder enhancements.[/code]ok now there is only a few you really need to know to beable to do this

anInt347 - maleExtraModelID
anInt330 - inventory/drop model
anInt390 - Male model id
class19.aRSString_362 = Class112.method1668(43, &quot;A DUMB FUCKING NAME&quot;);//Item Name
class19.aRSStringArray340 = new RSString[5];
class19.aRSStringArray340[1] = Class112.method1668(43, &quot;Wear&quot;);

and this is about it for the basics of adding a &quot;custom item&quot; but what do they all do exactly?

anInt347 - is for the male arms and so on but it can be used to add other models like i did for adding my wings onto a cape

anInt330 - is for the model that you see inur inverto and on the ground when you drop the item

anInt390 - is for the main male model ie the one that goes on your body

aRSString_362 - is to add a name to the item ie &quot;Dragon Platebody&quot;

aRSStringArray340 - is to add new options like &quot;wear&quot; to an item

so now an example to how they are used

[code]case 1125:
class19.anInt330 = 44576;//inventory/drop model
class19.anInt390 = 40207;//Male model id
class19.anInt347 = -1;//male sleeves
class19.aRSStringArray340 = new RSString[5];
class19.aRSStringArray340[1] = Class112.method1668(43, &quot;Wear&quot;);
class19.aRSString_362 = Class112.method1668(43, &quot;Dragon platebody&quot;);//Item Name
break;[/code]ok so the # after the int is the model id so for the dragon plate because the arms are a part of the main model i set anInt347 to -1 there for there is no EXTRA model to be added anInt330 i added model # 44576 and that is the invetory model and drop model so i think you are catching on well i hope you are ...

ok now for the more complicated part if the inventory view looks messed up

ok to fix it we add these ints
anInt336 - model zoom
anInt389 - modelRotation1
anInt395 - model rotation 2
anInt358 - model offset 1
anInt391 - model offset 2

now these numbers you just have to mess with until you get them how you want them its basicly a trial and error type of thing so i would just have to say good luck with that lol but you dont have to change them unless you really want to but anyways i hope you guys understand more il try to update this more if it is needed but now people can stop asking what are the ints and how can i find the ints... it all just the model id... that is all u need to know to make a new item...</description>
