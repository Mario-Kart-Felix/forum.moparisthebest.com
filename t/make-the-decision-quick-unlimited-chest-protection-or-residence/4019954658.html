        <p>I like the idea of an area plug in.  Being able to own land is pretty cool.  But would we be able to move around our area that we chose or will it be permanent?</p>
<p>The main reason why I like that idea is because I like hiding chests.  With unlimited chest protection there is no fun in even hiding chests.  You could just put them out in the open and not worry.</p>

I voted for the area plugin, I just think the benefits outweigh the short-term problems it may cause.<br>
[/quote]The problem is if anyone claims the area above my tracks I’m screwed. The only time we should install the residence plugin is if we do a map reset which isn’t going to happen(supposedly). As such I find the unlimited locks much less invasive. With Residence people could get together and build a wall around a area and completely trap everyone inside.[/quote]</p>
<p>How would people claiming land above your tracks cause any problem at all?  The plugin won’t allow them to stop you from continuing on your tracks, the worst they could do is modify your tracks or something, which could be handled on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Also I don’t see anyone building a wall to trap everyone inside without you noticing?  That could also be fixed easy with a teleport or something.</p>

<p>If anyone plays other servers, what about the faction plugin? That could keep raiding in existance, and factions would grow with alliances which are formed.</p>

The new plugin is going to cause nothing but problems. Let’s stop creating more and more issues with all of the new solutions. Before I left the server had unlimited locks and everything was fine and I didn’t have to worry about being griefed by someone stealing everything I own. There was still pvp and people still raided.

As as I see it disputes will keep happening. I know for a fact most of my places are over the max amount of claimable land so whats the point? This plugin is just stupid to me and it’s not even worth my time to use it on my structures. Griefers will just grief everything they can find that is not protected. Not to mention if all the area around you is protected all of a sudden you cant even get resources mining becomes impossible, railways become unbuildable. This plugin wont affect existing players instantly as it will newer ones. How you don’t see all the problems with this plugin is unknown to me.</p>

        <p>The only thing why i chose chests is because you can have multiple bases now.<br>
If we could spread the protection (like a 10x10 there and a 15x15 over here (not connected))<br>
Then it would be cool to have the residence.</p>

        <p>Protecting an area means you could have <span class="bbcode-i">pretty much</span> infinite protection. And it would lower griefing a lot. Just bury the chests or make them float. It’s not like you’re going to have chests that exceed the 64x64 limit anyways.</p>

        <p>i really dont see ppl using area protection to greif. yes its possible and easy to do. i really dont care about that would “law” or whatever its it that goes, “what ever can go wrong, will go wrong”. i c where u guys are coming from but theres nothing to worry about. bb brother doesnt protect u from greifing very well.</p>
<p>bb+uLWC situation: “oh crap i havent been on in 3 days…” <em>gets on</em> “shit my place is totally greifed” <em>does bb; “no modification in this area”</em> “are u f’n kidding me?” greifers 1, bb 0. js.</p>
<p>area plugin situation: <em>protects place, doesnt get on for a couple days</em> “oh i havent got on” <em>gets on</em> “yes im not griefed b/c of residence plugin” greifers 0, plugin 1.</p>
<p>solving greifers abusing the residence plugin is way easier, even blocking ppl in with it. for the rail system ally up with ppl on the server u can trust to share each others areas. nothing negative will come from the residence plugin stop worrying.</p>
<p>i see way more problems with unlimited chests.</p>
