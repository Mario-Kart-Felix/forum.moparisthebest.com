    <description>About 2 weeks ago i was attacked.  Reading thru apache logs it 1 big botnet and 1 smaller about a 20 to 1 ratio.

IRC Staff has failed a leadership test.  I posted IRC logs in the cm.  No one has been banned from irc.  The IRC Staff wants 

The IRC Staff member Thug Life opinion:
[code]
00(05:20:57) 07(15ruler07) the big reason to ban him is he is attacking other peoples sites
(05:21:12) 07(15Thug-life07) there is no proof in that though
(05:21:22) 07(15Thug-life07) till you find where he is actually attacking from
(05:21:29) 07(15Thug-life07) if its actually him
00(05:21:30) 07(15ruler07) we both know we will never be absolutly sure
(05:22:03) 07(15Thug-life07) well would you put someone up for the death penetly (sp?) if you wasnt 100% sure they killed that person?
[/code]
In other words I need 100% certainity before a ban.

Yesterday eFAK Joshy was in IRC.  This is the Joshy that used kibs servers and did not pay kib, did scams, ddosed mopar.  The IRC Staff would not ban him.

Some irc tidbits:
[code]
(23:43:02) 07@frank_: they prolly didnt even hack it
(23:43:05) 07Speljohan_: mak den Joshy
(23:43:18) 07Joshy: nah it would fall
(23:43:22) 07Joshy: without something to bring users
(23:43:24) 07@frank_: remember that last time Joshy made a forum
(23:43:29) 07@frank_: and scammed everyone
(23:43:33) 07Speljohan_: l0ol
(23:43:36) 07Speljohan_: just do dis:
(23:43:43) 07Joshy: 1.5 users franko
(23:43:47) 07Speljohan_: lie about havin autorune2
(23:43:49) 07Joshy: not bad for a scam site
(23:43:49) 07Speljohan_: den scam
(23:43:50) 07Speljohan_: all
(23:43:58) 07Joshy: already done it Speljohan_ =/
(23:44:02) 07Speljohan_: rifk
(23:44:03) 07Joshy: i was ar2 admin
(23:44:07) 07Speljohan_: pull a second raw
[/code]

IRC Staff member promoting ddosing:
[code]
(17:16:31) 07frank_: just ddos ikiliki until the faggot stops dosing us omg
[/code]

runelocus was hit with a big ddos attack over the past couple of days.  Ikiliki[God] blamed moparscape skiddies.


Number of Unique ips that hit rscheata.net 522, that hit runelocus.com 495, number of unique shared in both 72
So the person hitting runelocus over the past few days is the same one that hit me 2 weeks ago.


Info about the ddos on this site.
A person called kBr was hitting this site for revenge i believe for the attacks from the people in the IRC.  Yesterday he was told to stop after Spel talked to Ikiliki[God].

Current Status:
[code]
(15:35:07) (ruler) what do you knwo about the attacks on mopar
(15:35:15) (ruler) spel mentioned its kbr
(15:35:28) (ruler) he said he negoicated with you
(15:35:29) (Ikiliki[God]) At the beginning it was this kBr guy I believe
(15:35:31) (Ikiliki[God]) We weren&#39;t sure about it
(15:35:41) (Ikiliki[God]) but after he said he stopped, I were able to load the status page for a while.
(15:36:04) (Ikiliki[God]) The attacks right now are probably Jeebles, nmopar and some rawt dawg or something
(15:36:18) (Ikiliki[God]) They&#39;re attacking every single private server community except their own
(15:36:28) (Ikiliki[God]) Thinking they will become huge.
(15:36:44) (Ikiliki[God]) They&#39;re using T_X&#39;s botnet, and therefore not attacking me right now.
(15:36:57) (Ikiliki[God]) Since T_X uses to visit my site a lot these days

<p>Lusfr_ would not have the skills to create the botnet in any language. From what I know super_ wrote the botnet and gave it to Lusfr_ and asked him to take credits to take the hatrid etc from super_</p>
<p>My point:<br>
Ban everyone with something to do with Runelocus, as if they’re a member of that forum, they obviously do not like Moparisthebest. For the people that wish to be able to visit both, they should be required to say why they want to, and be allowed to at the discretion of the staff.</p>

My internet was shut down earlier today due to hosting my IRC with bots. Apparently, residential services for Comcast does not allow you to host anything at all, but I'm going to keep this website up, hoping my internet won't go out again.

In the meantime, check out Runesoft. They seem to be getting popular.</code></pre>

<p>Ok, fair enough(scroll down for IRC logs), but seriously, why, how even would I have IP logs? I’m not the one being attacked.</p>

Jul 20 19:29:26 &lt;Ikiliki[God]&gt;	so i heard<br>
Jul 20 19:29:35 &lt;Ikiliki[God]&gt;	It’s Jeebles attacking mopar, dodian and google<br>
Jul 20 19:29:43 &lt;Ikiliki[God]&gt;	He’s trying to get down all private server communities<br>
Jul 20 19:29:45 &lt;Ikiliki[God]&gt;	except his own<br>
Jul 20 19:30:04 	I heard from johan<br>
Jul 20 19:31:30 &lt;Ikiliki[God]&gt;	Gander, nmopal and rat dawg to be exact<br>
Jul 20 19:31:41 &lt;Ikiliki[God]&gt;	They were attacking us today<br>
Jul 20 19:31:45 &lt;Ikiliki[God]&gt;	they use T_X’s botnet</p>
<p>Jul 21 22:16:38 &lt;Ikiliki[God]&gt;	lol Nile<br>

<p>If you’re incapable of reading this, Ikiliki has access to T_x’s botnet, which he says was attacking mitb. 9 Bots won’t bring down mitb, so either he’s bullshitting, or he really is doing it.</p>
<p>Update, a little birdie told me the server/port to T_x’s botnet, and on godirc:</p>

<p>I am guilty of leaking info out of the cm section.  I was not aware of a policy that information here can not be shared.  People say what i post in the cm in IRC and all laugh at it.  politics…</p>

<p>As for Iki<span class="bbcode-b"></span>liki, he says that Jeebles is attacking all rsps communities using T_x’s botnet, however someone confided in me(which is why I won’t say his name) that Lusfr_ has access to T_x’s botnet, and Ik<span class="bbcode-b"></span>iliki has mentioned to me that he has access, not ownership, of a botnet.</p>
<p>Now ruler, I’m going to ‘pull a ruler’(not by UD’s definition either), Ik<span class="bbcode-b"></span>iliki has access to T_x’s botnet through Lusfr_ (which I should mention is o:line + service admin on IRC + administrator on forums), and Ikil<span class="bbcode-b"></span>iki is attacking the RSPS communities resulting in someone attacking run<span class="bbcode-b"></span>elocus to stop the attacks on mitb. [size=1pt]Prove me wrong.[/size]</p>
<p>This seems perfectly feasible for me, and if it’s true, it could be Ikil<span class="bbcode-b"></span>iki attacking rscheata not lawl.[/quote]<br>
That does sound feasible, having read the logs. That would also explain how Ik<span class="bbcode-i"></span>iliki created that list of ips that were attacking his box.<br>
Who knows, maybe he attacked himself to throw ruler off the scent - it’s the perfect way to get away with it. Who would attack their own website? Simple answer - someone who wants be seen as a victim, rather than the perpetrator.<br>
I think I’m onto something here, too.</p>
<p>As for the chat logs from Joshy, I’m afraid that I can’t take them seriously given the fact that I now know it’s the same Joshy that came onto freenode/botnetted people/scammed/etc.</p>
<p>EDIT: And before you dismiss this as something impossible, know that Ik<span class="bbcode-i"></span>iliki is bitter over being banned. We’re also aware that you have been relaying information from this forum section to him (he knew about the topic yz85racer created, for a start).<br>
The above is simply a hunch, much like yours.<br>
Only I see it as more likely that mine is correct - Ikiliki attacks your site, which leads you to think that this community’s members are involved. He then attacks his own site, playing the innocent victim. Finally he uses this to instigate attacks against this website, by saying the moparscape userbase is to blame.</p>

<p>This seems perfectly feasible for me, and if it’s true, it could be Ikil<span class="bbcode-b"></span>iki attacking rscheata not lawl.[/quote]<br>
The proof is the irc logs on <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> 2 weeks ago when lawl said he was attacking my site and my site was done, he said right around the time the site went dark.  Further proof is he has the technical knowledge, <a href="http://www.servbit.org/priv/index.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.servbit.org/priv/index.php</a> / <a href="http://www.servbit.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.servbit.org/</a>.</p>
<p>The additional statments come from Joshy who links c|p and lawl as the ones involoved with the botnet. c|p adds alot to the technical skills.</p>
<p>The proof is the ip logs of the attack on Ikiliki verse the attack on me 2 weeks ago.  The ip logs indicate that it is the same botnet.  Lawl was the only one that took credit for he attack.  The only people that talked about the attack were on mopar irc.  Many people in the mopar irc cheered on the attacks and gave rep to lawl.</p>
<p>The attacks one this site I noticed on saturday, i called mopar immedatly, i further investigated on IRC.  It was uncovered that Ikiliki site was attacked many days before that saturday, when he finally got back online he blamed moparscape skiddies.  It sounds to me people took revenege by attacking this site.</p>
<p>As for saying that Ikiliki might be the one that attacked rscheata 2 weeks, that further degrades the likelyhood of your position.  The facts are I had only talked to him on <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> irc months before.</p>
<p>I believe you are out of your element.  You have provided no actual hard evidence, no irc logs, no ip logs, just your political opinions.</p>
<p>[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 21, 2008, 02:56:47 PM[/size][hr][quote=“jme, post:24, topic:221457”]Anyone else remember when ruler redirected a ddos attack to hit <a href="http://moparisthebest.com?%5B/quote%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com?[/quote]</a><br>
The ddos that was redirected was one that orignated from the <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> irc.  The members in their were talking about it and did it.  This is over 2 years ago.  Thanks for the memories…</p>
<p>Acutally that adds more evidence to my evidence…</p>

<p>What’d Mopar say about being an asshole, Ruler? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Also, that wasn’t my doing, so die.<br>
You wouldn’t know either.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I don’t know what mopar said about me, but it would not surpise me.  For one he never removed my aryan scripts.  Star was not allowed do it bc mopar requested him not to.  Mopar dosn’t respect me.  He didn’t remove my bot till he was forced by a ddos from nerice.  Not to mention the ddos that i recieved from newbiehacker which hit first. Also mopar promised me that he would ban the cracker but didn’t bc the cracker was on his staff.</p>
<p>You on the other hand have done X100 more:<br>
distrubting leaking my sbot3 scripts.<br>
then helping admin a site that sold my scripts at a reduced cost (<a href="http://tonsofscripts.com" rel="nofollow noopener">tonsofscripts.com</a>)<br>
Then finally you see the light and actually purschase the scripts then you tried to charge back.<br>
leaking aryan scripts<br>
sending them in pms<br>
then you create <a href="http://pwndproductions.com" rel="nofollow noopener">pwndproductions.com</a> and bam their is my bot (UBI), never removed…</p>
<p>Frankly, i dont know what you have contributed but to disuade people from contributing.[/quote]</p>
<p>Lets be honest, you really want to open up things that happened 2 years ago.  You will find alot of people if they were banned we would have a community of people that contribute instead of leech.</p>
