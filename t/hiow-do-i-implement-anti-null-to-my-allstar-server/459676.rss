    <title>Hiow do i implement &quot;anti null&quot; to my allstar server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hiow-do-i-implement-anti-null-to-my-allstar-server/459676</link>
    <description>How would i go on making an ArrayList to stop people from nulling my server? Like Natelie&#39;s server nuller, etc. I have an idea of it but i sense i have almost no java skills, it&#39;s nearly impossible for me to make one, so i ask for your help moparscape .

Could you give me a little code to start off from atleast lol *spoonfeed* just a little?

Before you go and flame how much allstar sucks and your mind = blown. I would to say that I know little to no java at ALL. And sense allstar is poorly-coded I figured it would be easier to understand. (which i dont know why, i can edit things much easier in allstar and delta sources then PI and hyperon ) *callme a freak*</description>
