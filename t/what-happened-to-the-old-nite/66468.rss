Mega Nerds Huh? If we’re all such nerds, why not get off our Forums? It is mostly to do with gaming and game related stuff</p>

There is something wrong with his account though.</p>
<p>He has 21 level 99s</p>
<p>21*99 = 2079<br>
when a new skill comes out you are automatically level 1. and he has 2 skills that arent on highscore</p>
<p>so that means that his total has to be 2081 if he had those 2 skills at level 1… the only thing is that his total is 2080… its 100% impossible to happen.</p>
<p>so how the hell could that happen?</p>
<p>its really weird.<br>

He didn’t log on after Hunter? that might mean his stats didnt update?[br][size=1]Posted on: March 20, 2007, 06:44:57 PM[/size][hr][quote author=exe626 link=topic=96994.msg1031142#msg1031142 date=1174400419]<br>
Naw, if he actually died and the Jagex officials knew about it, it would be locked for sure<br>
But would ya look at that? Its not only un-locked, but theres somebody playing on it! :O!!<br>
He plays to his demise from cancer people said he had all the way from his grave…<br>
I know the games addicting, but damn… playing while your rotting in the ground, damn lol<br>

He had a son, That might be why it logged on?[/quote]</p>
