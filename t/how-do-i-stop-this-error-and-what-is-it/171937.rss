At first my server is okay , but after a while, I get that error, everyone gets kicked off, and it says they are already logged in.

How do I fix this?

<p>musicmad i have noticed that too. and it has nothing to do with an action you perform as far as i can tell…because i can be standing still alone on my server and it has happened. i think it is like a relay error when transfering from file to file that can happen. because it can occur no matter what as far as i can tell. its that or maybe a hidden error that doesnt need to be fixed but can cause an error over time.</p>
