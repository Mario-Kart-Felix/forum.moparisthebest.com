Hi, so i just started a server and my port forwarding works and everything is set to run. So i started the server and checked if it was online using rune locus server checker and it says its online. The problem i have is that when i try and connect using a client this is what it says in the server CMD:

Connection from 192.168.**.***       &lt;&lt;&lt; I have hidden my ip address.     
Connection reset
java.net.SocketException: Connection reset
     at java.net.SocketInputStream.read&lt;uknown Source&gt;
     at client.fillinStream&lt;client.java:9855
     at client.run&lt;client.java:18634&gt;
     at java.lang.Thread.run&lt;uknown Source&gt;
ClientHandler: Client null disconnected &lt;192.168.**.***&gt;

It does this three times then on the client it says &quot;error connecting to server&quot;
If you know how to fix please let me know! Thanks

*UPDATE* 
When i go into the client folder and change the ip in the EGUI.java file to 127.0.0.1 (local host) it works but when i change it back to my no-ip it comes up with that error!!</description>

Technically you don’t need an ip for connecting to yourself, if you leave it blank it connects to your server.</p>
