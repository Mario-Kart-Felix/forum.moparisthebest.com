    <title>Webclient freezes at unpacking</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-freezes-at-unpacking/381581</link>
    <description>OK this is the steps I have done in creating my webclient
1. uploaded my cache to dropbox, and it was a .zip
2.edited the CacheDownloader link in the cachedownloader.java wich now looks like:
[code=java]private String cacheLink = &quot;my cache link here&quot;; // Link to cache[/code]
(i put &quot;my cache link here&quot; in the place of where the link should be because I feel if I put the real link it would be advertising)
3. edited the updater link in the client.java wich now looks like:
[code=java] new Update(&quot;my cache link here&quot;, &quot;BDCache&quot;, signlink.findcachedir());[/code]
(^)
4. Jar&#39;d and signed my client then uploaded it to a html hosting site after creating a html page to host it on
this is where my problem is: I renamed my cache in my (C:) drive to BDCache2 to try and load the webclient for myself and it worked all the way
untill it got to the unpacking, at that point it just froze.
then I went back into my (C:) drive and renamed BDCache2 back to the originol name (BDCache) and then it webclient worked just fine.
can anyone help me?</description>

              <p>that’s just it!<br>
you see the only reason BDCache worked was because it’s cache you download while loading this webclient<br>
i changed it to BDCache2 to see if I was capable of loading the webclient myself wich I wasn’t because it freezes at the part of unpacking<br>
and when I changed it to BDCache is works, wich means the webclient cannot be downloadable for some odd apparent reaosn, and therefor my problem would be how can I fix the freeze at unpacking?</p>

              <p>that wasn’t the problem…<br>
the problem was that the webclient freezes once it gets to the unpacking part, I DON’T CARE WHAT THE CACHE IS CALLED<br>
PLUS I ALREDY NAMED IT BDCache AND I DON’T WANT IT NAMED BDCache2!<br>
no offense but please read my problem before answering it?=\</p>
