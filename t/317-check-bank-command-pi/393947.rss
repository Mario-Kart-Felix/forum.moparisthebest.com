    <title>[317] Check Bank Command [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-check-bank-command-pi/393947</link>
    <description>This command is set up to check banks of any existing player, regardless of whether or not they are online. It does so by checking players added to the PlayerHandler&#39;s players array. (online players) If the player is online, it will simply grab their bank and toss it at you, and if they are offline, then it will load their bank from their character file.

First up open Player.java and search for this:

[code]	public int bankItems[] = new int[Config.BANK_SIZE];
	public int bankItemsN[] = new int[Config.BANK_SIZE];[/code]

Below it add this:

[code]	public int oBankItems[] = new int[Config.BANK_SIZE];
	public int oBankItemsN[] = new int[Config.BANK_SIZE];[/code]

This will allow you to temporarily store someone&#39;s bank so that you can view it later.

You can close that up, we won&#39;t be needing it any further. Now open Client.java and make sure you have java&#39;s File and Scanner classes imported. They look like this:

[code]import java.io.File;
import java.util.Scanner;[/code]

If you don&#39;t have it, just toss it in with the rest of you imports. Then add the following method:

[code]	public boolean loadCharBank(String name){
		Scanner in = null;
		try{
			File acc = new File(&quot;Data/characters/&quot; + name + &quot;.txt&quot;);
			in = new Scanner(acc);
			while(in.hasNextLine()){
				String nextLine = in.nextLine();
				if(nextLine.contains(&quot;character-bank&quot;)){
					String line = nextLine.split(&quot;=&quot;)[1];
					line = line.trim();
					String stuff[] = line.split(&quot;	&quot;);
					int key = Integer.parseInt(stuff[0].trim());
					int id = Integer.parseInt(stuff[1].trim());
					int amount = Integer.parseInt(stuff[2].trim());
					this.oBankItems[key] = id;
					this.oBankItemsN[key] = amount;
				}else if(nextLine.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;[friends]&quot;))
					break;
			}
		}catch(Exception e){
			return false;
		}
		return true;
	}[/code]

What this does is use Java&#39;s File class to load up your character&#39;s file. Of course if you&#39;ve changed the path to the character files, you should reflect that change in the path above. If the character file does not exist, Java will throw an exception, which will be caught by the catch method, obviously, which will return false. The boolean returns will be explained later. If the file exists, then we&#39;ll use the Scanner class to read the file.

Now that we&#39;re reading the file, we&#39;re going to use what we know to read the relevant data we want. if we&#39;re looking at a line with &quot;character-bank&quot; we must be looking at their bank, so we&#39;ll get that data in. The code is pretty self explanatory at this point. We split the line by the = sign. What this does is return an array of strings where each index in the array is a part of the string that was split. For example, if we have
I went = to the = mall.
then split that by &quot;=&quot; we would get an array as such:
{&quot;I went &quot;, &quot; to the &quot;, &quot; mall.&quot;}

In our case, there&#39;s only one equal sign, so there&#39;s only two array indexes. We only need the second, as that&#39;s the data we want, so we only store the second. Now as we also know, data in our char files are separated by the &quot;space&quot; you get by pressing tab, which is also /t in most operating systems. I used the space itself to avoid any problems. Once you split by that space, you get an array containing the key, or slot in the bank, the item id and the item amount. we&#39;ll parse those to integers, and store them in our temporary bank. Once all that is finish, we return true.

Ok, now go to Commands.java and add this command (I&#39;m fairly certain you know how to add commands if you&#39;re looking at this tut)

[code]			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;checkbank&quot;)){
				boolean isOnline = false;
				String name = &quot;&quot;;
				try{
					name = playerCommand.substring(10);
				}catch(Exception e){
					c.sendMessage(&quot;You didn&#39;t enter a name.&quot;);
					return;
				}
				if(name.isEmpty()){
					c.sendMessage(&quot;You didn&#39;t enter a name.&quot;);
					return;
				}
				Client c2 = null;
				for(Player a : PlayerHandler.players){
					if(a != null){
						c2 = (Client)a;
						if(c2.playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(name)){
							isOnline = true;
							break;
						}
					}
				}
				if(isOnline){
					c.oBankItems = c2.bankItems.clone();
					c.oBankItemsN = c2.bankItemsN.clone();
					c2 = null;
				}else{
					if(!c.loadCharBank(name)){
						c.sendMessage(&quot;Character not found.&quot;);
						return;
					}
				}
				int tempItems[] = c.bankItems;
				int tempItemsN[] = c.bankItemsN;
				c.bankItems = c.oBankItems;
				c.bankItemsN = c.oBankItemsN;
				c.getPA().openUpBank();
				c.bankItems = tempItems;
				c.bankItemsN = tempItemsN;
				c.oBankItems = new int[Config.BANK_SIZE];
				c.oBankItemsN = new int[Config.BANK_SIZE];
			}[/code]

Ok so here we start off checking to make sure the inputted name is not blank. If it is, we&#39;re pretty much done. Next thing to do is declare a new client, we&#39;ll probably need it later. Now we start looping through each player. If that player is not null, then we cast it to our c2 client. Now we check that player&#39;s name, versus the name given to us from the command. If they match, our player is online, so we can break out of the loop, and best of all, we won&#39;t have to load it from the file later on. It&#39;s also a good idea to have a boolean to know if we found him online or not for later =P

Ok, so now we check if the player is online, based on our boolean variable that we set earlier. If it&#39;s true, it&#39;s because we found him online, so we take our c2 Client (this is why we needed to declare the client outside of the loop, so that it could stay within scope for this moment) and we copy the bank array to our temporary copy bank arrays. Be careful when doing this, because simply using the assignment variable to do this is not enough. You MUST invoke the clone() method on any object that you want to copy in this manner (in this case, our array) because otherwise, all you end up copying is the reference to memory, meaning instead of editing temporary values, you&#39;ll be editing the REAL thing. I&#39;m sure you can see how that would be a problem in our specific example ;)

Assuming our player was not online, we&#39;re going to load the bank up using our method from before. If it returns false, it means the character wasn&#39;t found most likely, so we let the user know. Perhaps he typed the name in wrong =P

Now that we have our temporary bank array loaded up, we make another temporary array, and assign our own real bank to it. In this case, we don&#39;t need to clone() because we actually do want to pass the memory reference instead of a copy of the object itself. Doing this allows us to give our own real bank array its reference back later on. Now we give our real bank array the reference to the memory of the other player&#39;s fake bank. Now that that is done, we open up the bank the way we would normally, and the server handles it as it normally would, except this time it&#39;s loading the other person&#39;s items, instead of your own ;)

As soon as the open bank method is done, we&#39;ll give our own real bank its original memory reference back, using our temp arrays from earlier, and we&#39;ll completely destroy the fake bank by assigning it new memory. Fear not, Java&#39;s garbage collection will take care of the crap we tossed out by doing this ;)

That&#39;s basically it. The only thing you might be wondering is, what if I try to withdraw something? Nothing happens, unless you have the same item as that person in your own bank, in which case, it will just withdraw it from your bank. Depositing will also deposit to your own bank.

I hope this will help out with any mischievous players on your server *cough* dupers *cough*

Post up any problems or errors.</description>

<p>since my method is in my client, i can just let it add the items with addItem     (no c. required)</p>
<p>This code gets the item from which ever bank is selected (via checkBankID) and removes that item from that bank.</p>
<p>is that better? :o</p>
<p>EDIT: i got it working <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
the Bank All was a little screwie due to the way it is set up but i got it working ^^’ can only withdrawl, not bank (to avoid accidental confusion), you right click them to check bank. once you open your bank via any method (other than ::bank) it will revert back to your bank. and while you are withdrawing from theirs, you can store it in yours. To make it work i didn’t have to add much other than what is above. Something in my packets class and i can remove the part from my commands(i had a command to revert it back to my bank, for my original design)</p>

<p>c.bankCheckingID = player.playerId;<br>
c.inBank = true;<br>
//then show their items<br>
}<br>
}<br>
[/code]</p>
<p>then in the bankX packet handlers you can just add</p>
<p><code>
Client player = PlayerHandler.players[c.bankCheckID];
if(player != null) {
player.removeFromBank(item, amount, slot);
//but you would still have to mess with that method to make it give the item to this player.
}</code></p>
<p>So you’d have to make a new method</p>
<p><code>
public void removeFromOtherBank(Client player, Client other, int item, int amount, int slot) {
//remove from other's bank and add item to player.
}</code></p>

              <p>You would have to explain that more, but i am curious how it knows who gets the item(s)… I know you would have a variable to tell you what their(or your) client id is(i think that is what you are getting at) and instead of it being null, should it just be your clientID#? (so you could just use Server.playerHandler.players[ID].(toBank/fromBank) and then you would have to send those items to the local user(you, the person taking the item) If i were to sit down and work it out that is probably how i would go about it.</p>

<p>client as in the class file, not as in the client it self…(it learns that stuff though resetBank() mostly–it resync’s all of the items) I figured you would know what i was talking about, considering were in the <span class="bbcode-b">server</span> help thread :o</p>
