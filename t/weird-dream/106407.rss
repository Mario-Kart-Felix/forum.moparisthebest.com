    <title>Weird dream</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weird-dream/106407</link>
    <description>Ok, i guess this is a weird post, but its something i have been searching for for awhile, and i cannot find any thing about what it might mean. Both me and a couple people i know have had similar dreams, which i find very odd...
Ok, in general the dream is just normal, but then we end up fighting/beating some one up, well we go to swing at them, and our arm moves really really slow, and we just can&#39;t seem to hit them hard at all. We have had a few dreams like this, so i guess i have two questions, has any one else had this happen? and does any one know what it may mean?</description>

              <p>Terrible things are waiting for you Hiaburi, the end of the world has just started and the monsters are awakening. They posess amazing powers which they can use to take over peoples minds in the dream world, and you my friend have been infected. There is nothing left we can do to help you, you are already in the hands of the monsters and many others will follow you…<br>
Conclusion: You are not one with yourself and you feel weak, you need to go to the gym and train if you want to get rid of the monsters.</p>

:eek:   Dude, what the fuck!?!? This honestly just fucking happened last night. It’s like, you go to swing, but your arm is really tired and you can’t swing very fast or far and all your punches just kinda rub against their face  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> .</p>

I cant write my dreams down because for most of em, i can tell im about to wake up and i keep myself asleep to finish the dream, like i realize im dreaming and going to wake up and i just stop myself so i can continue the dream, so by the time i do wake up most of the dream is long gone, all i can remember is the ending</p>

              <p>Well… i know this i very demented. But i had a dream where me and my famiyl was gonig to die horrible deaths, so we were considering suicide. Then my mum went to kill my dog and i was like hitting her with all my strenght but it wasnt hitting hard enough. So i was like tearijg up her skin and stuff. I woke up and now i think i seriously need help :S. But i think it was symbolising the love for my dog. [size=1pt]and the hate for my mum? i don’t hate her it was so wierd[/size]</p>
<p>I think dreams of not being able to hit hard means your fustrated. I must be very fustrated.</p>

              <p>I get dreams where I get frustrated like this but not exactly fighting.</p>
<p>For example i had a dream I was trying to cut something in half but I just couldn’t push hard enough to cut it fully. It made me feel really angry in my dream.</p>
<p>Probably something to do with stress.</p>

When i re-read my dream journal i noticed that in all my dreams i was standing on a bridge.</p>
<p>If you keep a dream journal maybe you will understand why you had this dream</p>

joke, but i did actually have a dream about kissing the lead singer.<br>
But i cant say ive had any dreams like how you described, usually dreams just reflect what our subconsciece(sp, wtf i know i suck at spelling) mind is thinking about.</p>
