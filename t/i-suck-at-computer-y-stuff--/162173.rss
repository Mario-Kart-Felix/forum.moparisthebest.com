    <description>Hey all, sorry if this is something you guys see all the time, but a couple of searches didn&#39;t yield anything that helped me, so I figured a new topic couldn&#39;t hurt too badly.

I downloaded SCAR and updated it with &quot;Include files&quot; etc (it did it itself). My question is... what now? The guides I can find are all for people who want to learn to code with SCAR. I just wanna use existing scripts - how would I go about it? I.E. once I have the code, from this forum usually (I wonder, with all the time you guys spend cheating, don&#39;t you think you could have a level 126 Runescape account by now? :P). It&#39;s obvious I copy and paste the code... but where to?

Thanks in advance... and sorry for the probably stupid question.

S.

P.S. I think this was the right forum to ask in... :S</description>

<p>There are always people that will “team” up with you, if you like, to make a script. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Well, you don’t need to know how to make a script to judge if a script is good or not, simple things like knowing what methods scripts used to do things is sufficient, an example off of the top of my head would be whether a script checks the text in the upper right corner before attacking what it assumes is an enemy. (The enemy could have moved, and the script would have clicked the ground, this would make the script very detectable if run for large amounts of time).</p>

<p>Well, the green text is known as comments. They are ignored by SCAR, and can be used either as information to the user(instructions on how to use the script), or for plain decoration. You should skim through this in case there is any instructions specifically for the script. The pink text, now that is called a “string”, in a nutshell, it’s considered text to the script. But generally, you should copy everything provided in “code tags” into SCAR, just for a reference of what it is. I’m not sure what links you visited, but if you could link to the script your using, or post it here(in code tags, I’ll explain further down), we could help you set it up. Scripts are always different, so knowing some basic things about SCAR coding and SRL will help with setting it up, usually it’s just a case of changing a few strings and replacing False with True, but it depends.</p>
<p>Code tags -</p>
<p>You use them like this:</p>
<p><code></code></p>
<p>And you can put say, a script inside them:</p>
<p><code>program CodeTagExample; 
begin 
  Writeln('Code tags are a bit more useful on large scripts'); 
end.</code></p>
<p>And it will appear like:</p>
<p><code>program CodeTagExample; 
begin 
  Writeln('Code tags are a bit more useful on large scripts'); 
end.</code></p>

<p>The problem is, (don’t let me put you off or anything), unless you know a bit about scripting in SCAR, you have absolutely NO idea what your using, and it could be detectable to Jagex, it could be out-dated and not work well, and a few other bits and bobs could get you banned.</p>
<p>I suggest if you really want to get into SCAR(I.E, start scripting), <a href="http://www.srl-forums.com/forum/index.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">I suggest you visit this forum, SRL.</a> SRL is the ONLY include for RS being updated almost daily, I mean before when Kaitnieks(in SCAR, go to help &gt; about) was around, there were a lot of includes being updated at once, then Aryan came along and that got abused and no one really used SCAR until it died. But like I said, if you want to get into scripting, head over to the SRL forums, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask.</p>

Best I could come up with without writing a guide myself XD</p>
<p>Basically most scripts will have green texts in the text area with numbers, Read through them for instrucitons, Follow them.</p>
