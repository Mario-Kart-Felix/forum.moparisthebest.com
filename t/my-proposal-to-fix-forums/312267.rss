    <title>My Proposal to fix forums</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-proposal-to-fix-forums/312267</link>
    <description>Warning people on a personal level and warning people just to &quot;enforce&quot; stupid rules that every veteran takes for granted (which he reserves the right to do) should result in inspecting this moderator&#39;s duties. Furthermore a rewrite of the rules to fit in with the forum&#39;s demograpic active population.

Afterall, we aren&#39;t fucking kids. The moderators might be needed at certain points, however the current level of fascism the rules enforce is just ridiculous (politically correct). If we are ever to progress as a community (and as a society in whole) freedom of speech must be enforced

There you have it, NOW DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT

EDIT: Additionally do NOT do thing behind the scenes from the users. Let the userbase vote for what&#39;s best for the community, afterall they are the people that hang here. Before any new rules are enforced do a poll and ask if this is really what people want. Direct-democracy is the way to go.

PS: seand&#39;s idea would make a great addition to this change as well: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,406620.0.html

To put it short: stop being wanker fascists and stop ignoring the problems</description>

              <p>I’m not really concerned about the forum software used, but most of the points, when applied to vBulletin, are moot.<br>
vBulletin (being a commercial application) is probably subject to penetration testing before major revision releases.<br>
And even if there are multiple entry points, they probably all depend on the same permissions checking function. Who knows, maybe they even mimic java’s SecurityManager check methods.</p>
<p>There’s no reason that multiple entry points should be taken as multiple implementations of a security checking function.</p>
<p>As for the whole sha1 vs md5 debate, that’s moot too – both have been declared cryptographically insecure and put into the “DO NOT USE” basket by government bodies such as the DOD, who now encourage the use of SHA-2 algorithms.</p>

Or vbulletin *-), version 4 will be a one time fee, no longer recurring payments <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Btw smf hashes like SHA1(usernamepassword) making it harder to crack, but they are not using salts, vbulletin is much more secure then that since it does MD5(md5(password)salt) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Btw there are SHA-1 tables as well, but usernamepassword will be to long to crack anyway <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Offtopic again, sorry.  But SMF’s password checking uses this to create a salt for a user:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$user_settings['passwordSalt'] = substr(md5(mt_rand()), 0, 4);</code></pre>
<p>So that creates a random salt, and it uses it in checking the password this way:<br>
SHA1(SHA1(usernamepassword)salt)</p>
<p>The reason you missed the first SHA1(usernamepassword) is because it actually happens via javascript in the browser, so the plaintext password is never even sent over the network.  All of these things make it much more secure than phpBB’s implementation.  (probably vbulletin’s too, but I don’t know)[/quote]<br>
You do know the passwords are stored without the salt in the db, do you?<br>
The salt is probably used for cookies;</p>
<p>Btw vbulletin does also md5 it’s password before sending <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

Sure, if an attacker grabs your hash he can resend it, but he never actually gets your password.<br>

<p>If someone has access to intercept or sniff your network traffic, short of using SSL, there is no way you are going to stop them from having access to your forum account when you log in.  At least this way they won’t have your password.</p>

<p>What about the multiple entry points into the program (and therefore the multiple repeated, identical code)?  That alone makes it more prone to bugs than SMF.</p>
<p>What do you mean that SMF is falling behind in security?  I don’t know of any place where this is true.</p>

<p>Offtopic again, sorry.  But SMF’s password checking uses this to create a salt for a user:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$user_settings['passwordSalt'] = substr(md5(mt_rand()), 0, 4);</code></pre>
<p>So that creates a random salt, and it uses it in checking the password this way:<br>
SHA1(SHA1(usernamepassword)salt)</p>
<p>The reason you missed the first SHA1(usernamepassword) is because it actually happens via javascript in the browser, so the plaintext password is never even sent over the network.  All of these things make it much more secure than phpBB’s implementation.  (probably vbulletin’s too, but I don’t know)</p>

<p>On topic:<br>
I agree with the fact that freedom of speech is a great thing (in the Netherlands it’s even one of the most important rights we have) but still there should be some regulations, there’s no point in turning every topic into a flamefest. Constructive criticism containing flame is no problem in my opinion and some people just deserve to get flamed at, certainly if they keep responding like an idiot.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I just posted in a thread on moparscape yesterday regarding different forum software, most of what I said about phpBB also applies to vBulletin, except for perhaps number 1.</p>
<p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:44, topic:312044”]phpBB, in my experience, is not nearly as good as SMF, for multiple reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>phpBB has always had more bugs (or ‘exploits’) than SMF and they have always been of a more serious nature.  In the years since I have been using SMF (since 2006) there has never once been any serious bugs in the software that allowed anyone to gain any staff permissions or anything that affected the forum at all.  phpBB has had these kind of exploits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last time I checked (granted it has been awhile, it likely has changed since then) phpBB uses md5 as the hashing algorithm for the passwords (fairly easy to crack, using rainbow tables), and sends the passwords in clear text from the browser to the server.  SMF uses sha1 hashes, and actually hashes your password with javascript in your browser and only sends the hash over the network, meaning that even if someone is sniffing your network, or even if the server administrator steals your hash, there is no way they can ever get your actual password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simply by the structure of phpBB, it is more easily exploitable and prone to bugs than SMF.  With SMF, everything is handled through index.php.  This means that the same code is used each time to check permissions, input, login status, login and everything else.  Also index.php is the single and only entry point into the software, if you want to do something extra, for example make people agree to a TOS, you just edit this one page.  However, phpBB (along with vBulletin, same flaw) uses multiple entry points into the application (just a few I could find, search.php, community.php, index.php, post.php, view.php, etc, etc)  This means duplicate code that doesn’t have to be there, and more of a likelihood of a bug in this code, AND if there is a bug with anything, it has to be fixed in every single one of those files, making more of a chance it won’t get fixed correctly or even allowing a new bug to be introduced.  And good luck if you are going to add a TOS or some other check to your forum, because you have to edit every single one of these files.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m sure there are other reasons as well, those are just a few that made me go with SMF (before it was cool to go with SMF ;))  Other things such as look and layout are just preference, I HATE the way phpBB looks, and LOVE SMF, but that doesn’t make one better than the other.[/quote]</p>
<p>IF (and that is a big if) I were to consider any software changes, it would probably be to FluxBB.</p>

<p>Update on the internet, now that I have a cable box in my yard with new cable buried in the ditch, I am now ‘serviceable’.

Or… why not simply implement a system to flag a post as spam? Then it disappears from view but like youtube comments you can click to read it anyway?</p>
<p>That would be the optimal solution<br>
[/quote]yeah so if x people vote it as spam it is hidden, leaving the option of viewing it to the reader. Sounds good to me![/quote]</p>
<p>Pretty interesting idea actually, I wouldn’t mind trying it out and if it doesn’t end up working and gets abused then we could just disable it.</p>
<p>As to speljohan’s idea in the first post, I have to say I agree with BAsh more.  Just allowing anyone to say whatever they want is not a good idea, in this country (and others) we have free speech, but you still can’t just say whatever you want, you are accountable for what you say and you can be punished for it.  Constructive criticism should be and is allowed, but pure flaming or spamming can and should be punished.</p>
<p>As to when I’ll upgrade to SMF 2.0 and implement all of these changes, I spent all day today digging a trench back to my house, and the cable company SHOULD be installing the internet tomorrow.  Then I should be able start working on the upgrade hopefully within the next week.</p>
