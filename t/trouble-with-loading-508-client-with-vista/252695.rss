    <title>Trouble with loading 508 Client with Vista</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trouble-with-loading-508-client-with-vista/252695</link>
    <description>My OS is Windows Vista Premium. I can&#39;t seem to load any 508 Clients. All of them come up with the same message:
&#39;java&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
Press any key to continue...


I downloaded the .ZIP file for a 508 client. I uncompressed it, and put it in the desktop. I opened the file, and pressed the run program. But that message kept coming up. On my old computer, I just did that, and the client popped up. But this, my new computer, that uses Vista, doesn&#39;t do the same as my Windows XP computer. What should I do? Because I personally don&#39;t know. If anyone can help, please post here, or even PM me. I&#39;m getting annoyed that I can&#39;t go on any servers, so soon would be nice. Thanks!</description>
