    <title>Should I start playing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-i-start-playing/546376</link>
    <description>Basically I made an account, and got some alright stats in F2P whilst it was free. I mainly trained skills. Once the trial was over, I didn&#39;t really want to pay for membership, but now I am debating as I have been trying to stay out of trouble. Should I start playing again to keep my time busy? Would anybody here play with me?</description>

              <p>I have started to notice a little nag in my head that is telling me to try OSRS out, but considering OSRS has overloads and other 500+ revision items it puts me off. The original idea was that we missed the 2007 RuneScape. This isn’t 2007 RuneScape.</p>
<p>Some people like it which is fair enough, but to me the damage has already been done. I have now accepted that nostalgia is just in the mind, and cannot be relived. I don’t support Jagex any longer because I feel that they wouldn’t support me.</p>
