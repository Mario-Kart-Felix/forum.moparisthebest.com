Step 1)Download the latest Version of Java JDK Found here: [url=http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/widget/jdk6.jsp]http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/widget/jdk6.jsp[/url]

Step 2)Once you install them You need to set the paths,Like this: Right Click on &quot;My Computer&quot; and click &quot;Properties&quot; a menu called &quot;System&quot; Should appear Find
&quot;Advanced System Settings&quot;(To the left of the System Screen) and click it! Now Find &quot;Environment Variables&quot;

Step3)IN THE FIRST WINDOW AT THE TOP! USER VARIABLES! 
Click New A box with &quot;Variable Name:&quot; and &quot;Variable Value:&quot; Should appear!
In Variable Name&#39;s Textbox(To the right of the name) Enter this:
[code]CLASSPATH[/code]
Now in Variable Value&#39;s Textbox enter this:
[code]CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_18\bin;%CLASSPATH%;[/code]

Now Click Ok!

Step3)
Click New in user Variables once more and enter this!
In Variable Name&#39;s Textbox Enter this:
[code]PATH[/code]

Now in Variable Value&#39;s Textbox enter this:
[code]C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_18\bin;[/code]
