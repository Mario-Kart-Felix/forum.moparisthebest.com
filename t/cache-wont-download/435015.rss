    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-wont-download/435015</link>
    <description>okay so i&#39;ve had problem after problem since thursday with the webclient, i have had to get a completely new signlink which now attempts to let the cachedownload (along with the CacheDownloader.java) however it just gets stuck on 0% when trying to download the cache, does anybody have an idea as to why, code:

signlink
[code]
    public static String cacheName()
    {
        return &quot;MythScape&quot;;
    }
[/code]

cachedownloader:
[code]
	private String cacheLink = &quot;http://dl.dropbox.com/u/65113766/MythScape.zip&quot;; // Link to cache
[/code]
