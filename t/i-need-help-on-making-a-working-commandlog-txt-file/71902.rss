              <p>just make a simple bufferd writer and add it in the case that does the :: thing, in other words just look for customCommand(" and add a bufferd writer underneath it, its very simple and noclip is a client side command so you cant delete it, add this to get rid of it <code>if (command.startsWith("noclip") &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt; 1) {
appendBanned(playerName);
sendMessage("You have been banned for using noclip when you logoff youll be banned");
}</code></p>
