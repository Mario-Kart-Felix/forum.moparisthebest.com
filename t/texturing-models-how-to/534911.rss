    <title>Texturing Models! (How-to)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/texturing-models-how-to/534911</link>
    <description>So, thanks to a few different people and resources, I finally figured out how to texture models. (amy_webb, thanks for your suggestion in my previous help thread regarding this, it came in handy; Dragonking, you supplied me with a hint as to where I should look, and I thank you for that, even though you said you forgot how to do it)

This guide has only been tested for 317 clients. It may work for higher revisions, but any errors or bugs you receive as a result of this guide are not my fault. 

To begin, you will need a model to texture (in .dat format), RSMV with texture support, and a Hex editor (Sublime Text 3 has a Hex Viewer package). I recommend also using a client to test the model, and a hexadecimal - to decimal converter (Windows 7 Calculator has one; View -&gt; Programmer)

To start off, open the model .dat in your Hex Editor. (I prefer Sublime Text because it allows me to enter lines and spaces between numbers, and does not affect the actual output) You should see a series of lines ranging from 0 to f (hexadecimal notation). Each two digits is a byte, and each two bytes is a word. 32 and f0 are bytes, 32f0 is a word. 

This is how my Sublime Text looks at the moment (and no, it is not a final product):

Alright, so you see this mess of numbers and letters, what do you do with it? I suggest scrolling to the very bottom, and counting 9 words out. This is the footer of the model. (In Sublime Text, it would be a whole line + a word) The first word is how many vertices your model has; keep that in mind if you&#39;re going to do vskins and such with it. The second word is how many triangles or faces your model has. This is extremely important, as it shows you how many bytes you need to copy and edit. 

The third word is made up of two bytes (in most models, it would look like 0000). This is the texture &quot;boolean&quot;, I&#39;ve been calling it. Depending on the model, the first byte can range from 01 to 04, and you would find this out by looking at the second block of code. (in my model, the second block is the one immediately after the last 7 in the top 3 rows) If the numbers range from 0 - 3 (e.g. 0101030102020103), make the first byte in the texture boolean 03. The second byte in the texture boolean, if you want textures enabled, is 01. In my example, I have the texture boolean set to 0101. 

On to the harder part. Now that you&#39;ve gotten the model to recognize textures, you have to actually give its triangles texture flags. For every triangle or face in the model (refer to the second word of the footer for this number), you need to type 02. The tricky part is getting the location right. I seem to get it to work properly when I put it immediately after the second block of code, the 010102010203 part. 

The next big thing you need to do is the UV Projection Flag, which comes immediately after the color data. To find the color data, you would need to know the value of one of the model&#39;s colors. The series that includes it (usually several times) is the color data chunk. If you can find the end of that chunk, you&#39;re in luck, because now you need to type out this section of code:
[0020 0021 0022] [0023 0024 0025] [0025 0026 0020]. I used brackets because you need to use the proper amount of words as the textured triangle number allows (the first byte in the texture boolean, usually 03). If you have a 01 in the texture boolean&#39;s textured triangle number, then use only the first bracket. If 2, use the 2 brackets, etc., but DO NOT INCLUDE THE BRACKETS. 

The last step is to actually make the model have texture. Go into the color data chunk and change any of the values you want to be a value of one of the textures. (REMEMBER: THIS IS HEXADECIMAL! Putting in a 40 will not get lava, it will get a grayish color. Lava is 28 in Hex)

I believe I have covered everything there is so far, if I think of any, I will revise this, as it is extremely late and I wrote this while half-asleep.

<p>Just saying, the first post has some incorrect information, but I don’t see an Edit button to change it.

I might even texture a few models for people.</p>

<p>[quote=“MeeE59, post:15, topic:534911”]Alright, here’s an update: only a few parts of the tutorial are correct. However, I can’t seem to find the Modify button to change the post, so I’m going to have to post here.</p>
<p>Starting off, you’ll probably want a good understanding of how models are made as .DAT:</p>
<p>[spoiler][quote]VERTEX_DIRECTION_Chunk : Bytes; Number of vertices in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains Vertex direction data, the data contained in each byte is a set Bit of Flags. Only the first 3 bits are used.<br>
Each Flag determines whether an addition is made to the x,y, or z axis when calculating the next vertex point.<br>
Example: The start point is always 0,0,0, so if the first vertex is at point 10,10,10 then All the Flags will be set and the byte value = 7.</p>
<p>ALWAYS Required.</p>
<hr>
<p>TRIANGLE_TYPE_Chunk : Bytes; Number of triangles in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains Triangle type data, the data is an integer Flag, of value 1-4, used to control how Triangles vertex numbers are loaded.<br>
Type_1 = New Triangle. Load v1, v2 and v3.<br>
Type_2 = v2=v3, load v3, v1=v1<br>
Type_3 = v1=v3, load v3, v2=v2<br>
Type_4 = v1=v2, v2=v1, load v3</p>
<p>NOTE: Type_4 is rare, Type_1 can be used to replace type 4 with only a small loss in compression.</p>
<p>Type_4 can only exist in 2 instances,<br>
a) when a new triangle is loaded and the next triangle type is of type_4.<br>
b) when the normal of the next triangle is inverted.<br>
Otherwise the vast majority of triangles will be of type_2 and type_3</p>
<p>ALWAYS Required.</p>
<hr>
<p>TRIANGLE_PRIORITY_Chunk : Bytes; Number of triangles in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains integer values used to calculate which triangles are drawn first, The higher the value the later they are drawn.</p>
<p>Used only when triangle priority is required.</p>
<hr>
<p>TRIANGLE_SKIN_Chunk : Bytes; Number of triangles in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains integer values that are applied to triangles in order to display animation data. The value represents the group the triangle belongs to.</p>
<p>Used only when animation is required.</p>
<hr>
<p>TEXTURE_POINTER_Chunk : Bytes; Number of triangles in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains integer values that point to which texture mapping triangle is used to texture the model triangle.<br>
A Value of 0 represents NO texture mapping.</p>
<p>Used only when texture mapping is required.</p>
<hr>
<p>VERTEX_SKIN : Bytes; Number of vertices in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains integer values that describe which vertex skin group a vertex belongs to.</p>
<p>Used only when animation is required.</p>
<hr>
<p>TRIANGLE_ALPHA_Chunk : Bytes; Number of Triangles in length</p>
<p>This chunk conatins integer values that are used to determine how transparent the model triangle is.</p>
<p>Used only when transparency is required.</p>
<hr>
<p>TRIANGLE_DATA_CHUNK : Bytes and/or Words; Length is Triangle_Data Length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains signed bytes and words that are used to calculate which vertices are used to describe the triangle. The value has an offset of 64 to determine wether the value is stored as a byte or a word. A base value of 0 is used. The values are stored as offsets to the next vertex.<br>
Example: the model starts with a triangle that uses vertices 2,3,4.<br>
The offsets from the base value will be +2,+1,+1<br>
This will be stored as 66,65,65 (or in Hex 42,41,41)</p>
<p>ALWAYS Required.</p>
<hr>
<p>COLOR_DATA_Chunk : Words; Number of triangles in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains integer values that describe which color, from the 65,536 color lookuptable, is used for the model triangle.</p>
<p>ALWAYS Required.</p>

<p>UV_MAP_TRIANGLES_Chunk : Word,Word,Word; Number of texture triangles in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains the positions of the UV(0,0), UV(0,1) and UV(1,0) information required to calculate the UV coordinates for textured model triangles. The ‘texture triangle’ represents the flat mapped texture which the model triangles are projected onto to produce the UV coordinates.<br>
I recommend using DatMaker’s “Vert Nums” function to find which vertices to make the texture triangle.<br>
Used only when texture mapping is required.</p>

<p>What I still have yet to figure out is the meaning of the different Texture Pointer types. This model happens to have 10 different ones, starting at 2 and increasing by 4:<br>
Hex:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>which translates to decimal:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>However, in the process of writing this post, I managed to create an NPC for my client (my client has a couple extra textures) that has textured wings. The way I did this is relatively simple:<br>
I added a triangle in Metasequoia parallel to, and above, the section of the model I wanted to have texture. Once I save it as a .MQO, I opened it in DatMaker.<br>
Made it into a .DAT.<br>
Opened the .DAT in Sublime Text 3 and went to the footer.<br>
Changed the texture triangle amount to 1 (since that’s how many triangles I used) and added the uses textures flag. (0101 after the number of vertices and faces).<br>
Removed the last value from any place triangles are used (TSKIN, Priorities, Color data, etc.), and subtracted 1 from the number of faces in the footer.<br>
Added the Texture Pointer chunk, which is simply 00 for all faces that don’t use the texture and 02 for the ones that do (I assume it goes up by 4 every time you add a new triangle to UV Map Data, will experiment). To get this, I copied the Color Data chunk to a new tab in ST3, and changed every color not a texture (textures usually range from 0001 - 0030) to a 00 and every color that IS a texture to 02.<br>
After that, I looked at the MQO model in DatMaker and turned on Vert Nums. The UV Map Triangles are the vertices that the extra triangle I added have at the corners. Convert those Vert Num values to Hex, and depending on which way you want the texture to be drawn (or flowing in some cases), the three values can be arranged. (It also depends on how you draw the triangle.)</p>
<p>I saved the .DAT in ST3, opened it again in DatMaker to check to see if everything looked alright (the added triangle was invisible, and the model looked normal), and then put it in my client’s models folder, added the ints for the NPC (it was an NPC model), compiled and ran. This is the outcome: <img src="http://gyazo.com/84365fc9a22f4a92c7e0c78f8054b58d.png" alt width="" height="">[/quote][/spoiler]</p>
<p>Just in case, I would really like to learn a little more about this if you have time to run me through it.</p>

              <p>nice done only problem is if you have to do this all time you are spending a lot of time for 1 piece of the model so to get a server done with textures you are months busy with just adding texture to like 30 models? idk how much time you spend on 1 of course if you do it all the time u get used to it but still takes lot of time, i have been busy the same way as u did and came to the conclusion that it takes some serious time <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Alright, here’s an update: only a few parts of the tutorial are correct. However, I can’t seem to find the Modify button to change the post, so I’m going to have to post here.</p>
<p>Starting off, you’ll probably want a good understanding of how models are made as .DAT:</p>
<p>[spoiler]</p><blockquote>VERTEX_DIRECTION_Chunk : Bytes; Number of vertices in length.
<p>This chunk contains Vertex direction data, the data contained in each byte is a set Bit of Flags. Only the first 3 bits are used.<br>
Each Flag determines whether an addition is made to the x,y, or z axis when calculating the next vertex point.<br>
Example: The start point is always 0,0,0, so if the first vertex is at point 10,10,10 then All the Flags will be set and the byte value = 7.</p>
<p>ALWAYS Required.</p>
<hr>
<p>TRIANGLE_TYPE_Chunk : Bytes; Number of triangles in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains Triangle type data, the data is an integer Flag, of value 1-4, used to control how Triangles vertex numbers are loaded.<br>
Type_1 = New Triangle. Load v1, v2 and v3.<br>
Type_2 = v2=v3, load v3, v1=v1<br>
Type_3 = v1=v3, load v3, v2=v2<br>
Type_4 = v1=v2, v2=v1, load v3</p>
<p>NOTE: Type_4 is rare, Type_1 can be used to replace type 4 with only a small loss in compression.</p>
<p>Type_4 can only exist in 2 instances,<br>
a) when a new triangle is loaded and the next triangle type is of type_4.<br>
b) when the normal of the next triangle is inverted.<br>
Otherwise the vast majority of triangles will be of type_2 and type_3</p>
<p>ALWAYS Required.</p>
<hr>
<p>TRIANGLE_PRIORITY_Chunk : Bytes; Number of triangles in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains integer values used to calculate which triangles are drawn first, The higher the value the later they are drawn.</p>
<p>Used only when triangle priority is required.</p>
<hr>
<p>TRIANGLE_SKIN_Chunk : Bytes; Number of triangles in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains integer values that are applied to triangles in order to display animation data. The value represents the group the triangle belongs to.</p>
<p>Used only when animation is required.</p>
<hr>
<p>TEXTURE_POINTER_Chunk : Bytes; Number of triangles in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains integer values that point to which texture mapping triangle is used to texture the model triangle.<br>
A Value of 0 represents NO texture mapping.</p>
<p>Used only when texture mapping is required.</p>
<hr>
<p>VERTEX_SKIN : Bytes; Number of vertices in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains integer values that describe which vertex skin group a vertex belongs to.</p>
<p>Used only when animation is required.</p>
<hr>
<p>TRIANGLE_ALPHA_Chunk : Bytes; Number of Triangles in length</p>
<p>This chunk conatins integer values that are used to determine how transparent the model triangle is.</p>
<p>Used only when transparency is required.</p>
<hr>
<p>TRIANGLE_DATA_CHUNK : Bytes and/or Words; Length is Triangle_Data Length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains signed bytes and words that are used to calculate which vertices are used to describe the triangle. The value has an offset of 64 to determine wether the value is stored as a byte or a word. A base value of 0 is used. The values are stored as offsets to the next vertex.<br>
Example: the model starts with a triangle that uses vertices 2,3,4.<br>
The offsets from the base value will be +2,+1,+1<br>
This will be stored as 66,65,65 (or in Hex 42,41,41)</p>
<p>ALWAYS Required.</p>
<hr>
<p>COLOR_DATA_Chunk : Words; Number of triangles in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains integer values that describe which color, from the 65,536 color lookuptable, is used for the model triangle.</p>
<p>ALWAYS Required.</p>
<hr>
<p>UV_MAP_TRIANGLES_Chunk : Word,Word,Word; Number of texture triangles in length.</p>
<p>This chunk contains the positions of the UV(0,0), UV(0,1) and UV(1,0) information required to calculate the UV coordinates for textured model triangles. The ‘texture triangle’ represents the flat mapped texture which the model triangles are projected onto to produce the UV coordinates.<br>
I recommend using DatMaker’s “Vert Nums” function to find which vertices to make the texture triangle.<br>
Used only when texture mapping is required.</p>
<hr>
<p>X_DATA_Chunk : Byte and/or Word; XdataLength in length</p>
<p>This chunk contains signed bytes or words, used to calculate the X value for the vertex position. A base offset of 0 is used and the number stored is the offset from one vertex position to the next.<br>
An offset of 64 is also applied to the data to determine if the value is stored as a byte or a word.</p>
<p>ALWAYS Required.</p>
<hr>
<p>Y_DATA_Chunk : Byte and/or Word; YdataLength in length</p>
<p>This chunk contains signed bytes or words, used to calculate the Y value for the vertex position. A base offset of 0 is used and the number stored is the offset from one vertex position to the next.<br>
An offset of 64 is also applied to the data to determine if the value is stored as a byte or a word.</p>
<p>ALWAYS Required.</p>
<hr>
<p>Z_DATA_Chunk : Byte and/or Word; ZdataLength in length</p>
<p>This chunk contains signed bytes or words, used to calculate the Z value for the vertex position. A base offset of 0 is used and the number stored is the offset from one vertex position to the next.<br>
An offset of 64 is also applied to the data to determine if the value is stored as a byte or a word.</p>
<p>ALWAYS Required.</p>
<hr>
<p>FILE_FOOTER_Chunk : Bytes and Words; Length is 18 bytes.</p>
<p>This chunk contains the data lengths and data flags used to store the file.</p>
<p>Word - Number of vertices<br>
Word - Number of triangles<br>
Byte - Number of Texture triangles<br>
Byte - Use textures FLAG<br>
Byte - Use Triangle Priorities FLAG (FF for True)<br>

Well, with the client I have (Project Rainbow), I simply added the textures to the cache using Tom’s Cache Suite, and changed all the values in Class30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub3 (or Textures, if it’s renamed) that were 50 to 50 + t, where t is the number of new textures (in my case, I added 3). Then I loaded up the client, even tested the textures on a fire cape (since I had no idea how textures worked back when I was adding textures).<br>

how did you get the client from Project Rainbow with the java files?<br>

This is practically the same tut made by mrpotatohead for dragonking a long time ago that is no longer available, but it is very well written. Very nice job although this doesn’t allow for custom textures. Perhaps if you could create a tool that can pack custom textures into the cache then that would be cool. At least now the information isn’t lost, thanks for writing this.<br>
[/quote]Custom textures can be packed into the cache with Tom’s Cache Suite.<br>
I tried to be as clear as possible, but I feel some information could be hard to understand if you’ve never worked with things like this before. (I was even unsure as to what I was doing when I first started)[/quote]<br>
Does toms suite allow this? What is the max res for textures? I know the largest are extremely tiny with today’s standards haha but not sure if it is the max.<br>
Someone should use your tutorial with this:<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,521499.msg3789539.html#msg3789539" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,521499.msg3789539.html#msg3789539</a><br>
And create something cool. Also what rsmv has texture support? If you are referring to that one on r-s you can hardly call that texture support. He did the pnm vectors wrong and he somehow managed to apply the texture to the grid lol.</p>

have you gotten a finished/textured model into the client yet? if so pictures would be awesome! I’ve always wanted to be able to texture my models.<br>
[/quote]I actually have. I made a sleeping cap (just a random model I grabbed) use the flowing water and lava textures.<br>
The only problem I see is that the spaces for the texture are a little too small, so it’s hard to tell there’s a texture there.<br>

              <p>So, thanks to a few different people and resources, I finally figured out how to texture models. (amy_webb, thanks for your suggestion in my previous help thread regarding this, it came in handy; Dragonking, you supplied me with a hint as to where I should look, and I thank you for that, even though you said you forgot how to do it)</p>
<p>This guide has only been tested for 317 clients. It may work for higher revisions, but any errors or bugs you receive as a result of this guide are not my fault.</p>
<p>To begin, you will need a model to texture (in .dat format), RSMV with texture support, and a Hex editor (Sublime Text 3 has a Hex Viewer package). I recommend also using a client to test the model, and a hexadecimal - to decimal converter (Windows 7 Calculator has one; View -&gt; Programmer)</p>
<p>To start off, open the model .dat in your Hex Editor. (I prefer Sublime Text because it allows me to enter lines and spaces between numbers, and does not affect the actual output) You should see a series of lines ranging from 0 to f (hexadecimal notation). Each two digits is a byte, and each two bytes is a word. 32 and f0 are bytes, 32f0 is a word.</p>
<p>This is how my Sublime Text looks at the moment (and no, it is not a final product):</p>
<p><img src="http://gyazo.com/503635f23c725cfc6d9da3868f0be082.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Alright, so you see this mess of numbers and letters, what do you do with it? I suggest scrolling to the very bottom, and counting 9 words out. This is the footer of the model. (In Sublime Text, it would be a whole line + a word) The first word is how many vertices your model has; keep that in mind if you’re going to do vskins and such with it. The second word is how many triangles or faces your model has. This is extremely important, as it shows you how many bytes you need to copy and edit.</p>
<p>The third word is made up of two bytes (in most models, it would look like 0000). This is the texture “boolean”, I’ve been calling it. Depending on the model, the first byte can range from 01 to 04, and you would find this out by looking at the second block of code. (in my model, the second block is the one immediately after the last 7 in the top 3 rows) If the numbers range from 0 - 3 (e.g. 0101030102020103), make the first byte in the texture boolean 03. The second byte in the texture boolean, if you want textures enabled, is 01. In my example, I have the texture boolean set to 0101.</p>
<p>On to the harder part. Now that you’ve gotten the model to recognize textures, you have to actually give its triangles texture flags. For every triangle or face in the model (refer to the second word of the footer for this number), you need to type 02. The tricky part is getting the location right. I seem to get it to work properly when I put it immediately after the second block of code, the 010102010203 part.</p>
<p>The next big thing you need to do is the UV Projection Flag, which comes immediately after the color data. To find the color data, you would need to know the value of one of the model’s colors. The series that includes it (usually several times) is the color data chunk. If you can find the end of that chunk, you’re in luck, because now you need to type out this section of code:<br>
[0020 0021 0022] [0023 0024 0025] [0025 0026 0020]. I used brackets because you need to use the proper amount of words as the textured triangle number allows (the first byte in the texture boolean, usually 03). If you have a 01 in the texture boolean’s textured triangle number, then use only the first bracket. If 2, use the 2 brackets, etc., but DO NOT INCLUDE THE BRACKETS.</p>
<p>The last step is to actually make the model have texture. Go into the color data chunk and change any of the values you want to be a value of one of the textures. (REMEMBER: THIS IS HEXADECIMAL! Putting in a 40 will not get lava, it will get a grayish color. Lava is 28 in Hex)</p>
<p>I believe I have covered everything there is so far, if I think of any, I will revise this, as it is extremely late and I wrote this while half-asleep.</p>
<p>Planned updates to this guide:</p>
<p>[ul][li]More pictures of successful texturized models[/li]<br>
[li]Video guide[/li]<br>
[li]Convert to a .dat editing guide[/li]<br>
<a>li</a> Open this thread for requests for textured models[/li][/ul]</p>
