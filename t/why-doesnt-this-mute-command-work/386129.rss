    <title>Why doesn&#39;t this mute command work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-doesnt-this-mute-command-work/386129</link>
    <description>Command doesn&#39;t mute the user :S, basically it just just tells them their muted but you can still see their writing and they can still yell. It also writes their name to a mute list in my server files S:. My ip mute works fine at muting them in normal game and in yell.
[code]if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;mute&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 1) {
            try {   
               String playerToBan = playerCommand.substring(5);
               Connection.addNameToMuteList(playerToBan);
               for(int i = 0; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++) {
                  if(Server.playerHandler.players[i] != null) {
                     if(Server.playerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToBan)) {
                        Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[i];
                        c2.sendMessage(&quot;You have been muted by: &quot; + c.playerName);
						
						
                        break;
                     }
                  }
               }
            } catch(Exception e) {
               c.sendMessage(&quot;Player Must Be Offline.&quot;);
            }         
         }
