    <title>[HELP][RS2HD] 562! [Please!]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-rs2hd-562-please/391615</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I have been working on my server source for quite some time, and well I really want it to be successful. Its a 562 loading 602.

I have a couple of things wrong with it:

1. There is &quot;No&quot; 1 click pvp.    &lt;--- Want this fix the most!
2. The ancient curse interface is messed up.  &lt;-- Would be nice :)
3. People can mage or range a npc/boss and tele and it will still be attacking them.      &lt;--- This will just get people banned :L
4. You can not far-range or mage an npc.             &lt;--- Kinda annoying but I can live with it.
5. If I drop an item, no one can pick it up.    &lt;-- Would really like this fix.

Here&#39;s a video to demonstrate the pvp + ancient curses :  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrrbaJ55je0

As you can see, I am not a very good coder. If I was, I would be able to fix this problems myself. So I am calling to the community to help me! If anyone out there can help me fix these problems and wishes to be a part of my server, they are more than welcome.

If you are a 562 RS2HD coder and know how to do most/all of this. I would be happy to allow you to work alongside me on the server. Add me on msn: ben.gamer@live.co.uk

Also, if your sat there like &quot;LMFAO this kid has no idea!!&quot; I do have an idea, thanks. Also this server was rather successful in august 2010.

Please Please Reply. These fixes would be amazing!

Thankyou</description>

              <p>Thanks for the suggestions, but I did not start with 562 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  have been playing moparscape since a server called “sun-scape1” which I think was a 194 so I dived into 317s. Once I learnt what I wanted from 317s, I moved onto 562s because I like real rs, just wish I was richer <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Ya know, I was like you, just starting to code, and going RIGHT into 562’s.<br>
Trust me it’s not very smart lol. I’m DECENT in coding as from where I first started.<br>
If you just started learning, or know the basic’s, try Hyperion, or PI. PI is what I started off with, and now I know tons about them.(Not EVERYTHING LOL)<br>
So yeah, my suggestions.<br>
Now if your looking into actually coding your 562, look for some guides, like everywhere.</p>
<p>Good luck ! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
