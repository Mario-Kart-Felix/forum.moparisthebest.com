They don&#39;t realize it&#39;s a link and think that they should post here. Maybe change it to &quot;Click here for Moparscape&quot;?</description>

<p>I’m going to steal someone’s idea here.  (Someone posted this before and I don’t remember who <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>
<blockquote>After the TOS page there could be a second page that had a big button at the top that said "MoparScape", then at the very bottom there could be a link that said "MITB: Boring shit you won't like".</blockquote>
^Someone please tell me who posted that. It was a great idea.

Seriously all i see out of you is calling moparscapers, like i said on IRC you must be hiding something.<br>
Reverse physiology imo.</p>
<p>I’m expecting another pathetic moparscape insult directed at me after he reads this.</p>

<p>Even still all this ‘delete moparscape’ shit needs to stop, yes even though i do not like it, and all the children and pointless screaming and crap that goes on there is the reason i did not stay ‘messing’ with private servers for more than a month, yes i still hung around there and still do post there every once to see if they have progressed much, and everyone needs a good laugh once and a while <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>So cut the ‘delete moparscape’ shit because it is causing you next to no problem if you just ignore it, its not like you get 50 posts a day asking about private servers on this site, you get an odd one or two, not even that.</p>

<ol>
<li>If we remove MoparScape, they will all come here</li>
<li>Creating a quiz on the rules will make them read the rules, yes, but who the hell says they will follow them?</li>
