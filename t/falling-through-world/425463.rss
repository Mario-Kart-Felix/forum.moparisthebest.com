    <title>Falling through world</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/falling-through-world/425463</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having a bit of an issue and I&#39;m not sure what can be done to fix it.
It just started yesterday after all that roll back stuff.

Now every time the server saves I log off.
No matter where I am in the world when I log back on I&#39;m suddenly falling in to the void and soon die.
Wouldn&#39;t be so bad but I keep losing my building materials and tools.

What would have caused this to start? and/or is there anything I can do to fix it.
Thanks</description>

              <p>Also, since this started happening sometimes when you log in you log back in at spawn no matter where you were. I know it’s not as bad as falling through the world, since you don’t lose your items. But it can be pretty inconvenient</p>
