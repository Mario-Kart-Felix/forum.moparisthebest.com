    <title>Need help fixing buying x option and thieving stall</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-fixing-buying-x-option-and-thieving-stall/278038</link>
    <description>Ok so i added a buy x option to my source and i made it so people can&#39;t buy more than 1k items at once but i just tried it out and i entered to buy 1k law runes and isntead it bought me 5k law runes, how do i fix it so i enter 1k, get 1k &quot;items, runes, etc..&quot; and pay for only 1k

this is what i got in my client.java atm:

&lt;blockquote&gt;else if (XinterfaceID == 3900) { //Shop
					if (EnteredAmount &lt; 1001)
						buyItem(XremoveID, XremoveSlot, EnteredAmount);
					else
						sM(&quot;You cannot buy more than 1k items at a time.&quot;);
				}&lt;/blockquote&gt;


- Also when i click on my thieving stall it kicks me out of the server and logs me back in and i get the money from the stall after logging in but no exp, how do i fix it so it doesn&#39;t kick me out? could anyone tell me wat it should look like so it works perfectly? 

Thank You!</description>
