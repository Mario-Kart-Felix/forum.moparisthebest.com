    <title>[PI] Achieve items with your 99s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-achieve-items-with-your-99s/458157</link>
    <description>On my server my skillcape shop is a bit lagged. Instead of there being a skillcape shop I would like players to get the skillcapes/hoods when they achieve their 99s. How would I go about doing this?
All help is Appreciated, Thanks.</description>
