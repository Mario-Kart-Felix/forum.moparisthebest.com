    <title>Regarding access to the Community Member section</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/regarding-access-to-the-community-member-section/239281</link>
    <description>I write this post out of curiosity, and the fact I noticed how easy it is to obtain Community Member these days, does the rank not mean anything anymore? I remember when I first joined the RuneScape cheating scene, back on Kaitnieks (I think I only posted like twice, and they were asking how to make a server  :o), but I do remember seeing the Community Member but never really took notice until I joined mopar&#39;s scene. I noticed it on frank_ first, and at that time I sort of realized how I would like to one day wear that rank under my name. It seems to be ever since Thug-life and myself have gotten access to this section, everyone has it.

By this I mean, ``jason, what has he ever done for the community? I saw that magma is near access, at 47 rep. Come on, [i]MAGMA?[/i] All he does is post retarded posts about needed help with Java, heh, don&#39;t get me wrong, I used to post WORSE than his questions, but I soon learned that I should not expect things written down in idiotic terms for me - I believe having frank_ on MSN taught me that more than anything, because we all know how he deals with idiots :P.

I am just throwing this out there, but we can perhaps do something to make it a little &#39;tougher&#39; to get the Community Member rank, perhaps actually working for it, rather than asking people to rep you? I only wrote this post as it occurred to my mind, 2 years ago Community Member was actually something to be proud of, and meant something, now, it&#39;s just as good as [i]Senior Member.[/i]</description>

              <p>On Kaitnieks I was about 10 rep away from CM. All from helping people.</p>
<p>Here, I kinda gave up. I got about 1/4th of it from helping people, but the rest of it is people giving it to me because of my activity in the Graphics section, helping there and just posting my own work. It’s kinda weird but I can’t choose what I get it for.</p>
<p>So maybe I shouldn’t be here either.<br>
But seriously not much goes on here that should be private anyways.</p>

There is a lot to be given to the community, just not using the 317 protocol, everything has been done. I think the situation is more like “no one can be bothered to learn and try to contribute”.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Greeny, post:31, topic:239281”]It’s a bad idea because you’re all disregarding the definition of “community”. The staff already decide who gets CM, because once you reach 50 rep you have to request CM and I’ve seen people (and there is evidence in this topic to suggest) people wont always get it.</p>
<p>Let’s look at this logically, you’re saying you’re giving staff more power over who is given CM, therefore taking away more rights of the community to choose it’s elite.[/quote]<br>
If we went with my solution then it would ultimately be the individual that decides whether or not they maintain their rank/rep. If nothing else it gives people a reason to stop acting stupid.</p>
<p>For the record, I’ve only ever knocked back one or two people (after subjecting their rep to scrutiny). Just the other day I had Yz85Racer come to me with concerns that magma was cheating the rep system - I looked into it, and ended up stripping him of about half of his reputation points; all of them were for stupid posts. I think that’s doing the right thing by you guys.<br>
We wouldn’t need to though if the system wasn’t abused in the first place - if RegeX didn’t end up with 50+ reputation in a matter of minutes (and this has happened several times) then he wouldn’t have been able to run a script to give out truckloads of reputation points, ultimately reducing or removing their value.</p>
<p>And yes, people like RegeX and Xerxes will forever be knocked back, despite the amount of reputation points that they get.<br>
They’re no longer welcome here; the only thing that repping people like that does is throw up red flags for me (trust me, I check every ‘new’ account that has an unusually high amount of reputation when I see it) and potentially gives more people access to this section.</p>

<p>I would agree on the vote in part. Because rep has become to easy to get here and I don’t think we need idiots disturbing the peace, I suppose you could say. As for the warnings removing rep part, I don’t really care much for the warnings thing, because it could be easily gained back.</p>

<p>Maybe a system where people lose reputation when they receive warnings could be of some use.</p>

</aside>
<p>Actually, that is the best idea I have heard that solves this problem.  Obviously negative rep gets abused and will not work, but losing rep due to warnings would work great.  It should keep the current community members (who should set the bar for the rest of the community anyway) in line for fear of losing their community member status.  Also, currently warnings don’t have any lasting repercussions, and I think they need to, I just never thought of any good things to punish with.</p>
<p>Does anyone else think this is a great idea?  And what values for what level of moderation?</p>

<p>I only support it if it’s set up so that if I were to get warned on the moparscape forums, then it would take away from my moparscape rep and not mitb rep.</p>

<p>I completely disagree.  I believe that whether or not you are warned on either side of the forum, it will decide your status.  I personally don’t like to see community members posting random pictures and spamming on that side of the forum.  It shows extreme immaturity and dis-respect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I completely agree with Greeny.[/quote]<br>
yeah but its two completely seperate values so getting deducted on one instead of the other makes sense seeing as how you can only gain on one or the other per rep</p>

<p>Maybe a system where people lose reputation when they receive warnings could be of some use.</p>

<p>Actually, that is the best idea I have heard that solves this problem.  Obviously negative rep gets abused and will not work, but losing rep due to warnings would work great.  It should keep the current community members (who should set the bar for the rest of the community anyway) in line for fear of losing their community member status.  Also, currently warnings don’t have any lasting repercussions, and I think they need to, I just never thought of any good things to punish with.</p>
<p>Does anyone else think this is a great idea?  And what values for what level of moderation?<br>

<p>I only support it if it’s set up so that if I were to get warned on the moparscape forums, then it would take away from my moparscape rep and not mitb rep.</p>

<p>I completely disagree.  I believe that whether or not you are warned on either side of the forum, it will decide your status.  I personally don’t like to see community members posting random pictures and spamming on that side of the forum.  It shows extreme immaturity and dis-respect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I completely agree with Greeny.</p>

              <p>It’s a good idea and a terrible idea. I say it’s good because Lothy came up with something not previously done… everything else mentioned in this topic has been done before and failed.</p>
<p>It’s a bad idea because you’re all disregarding the definition of “community”. The staff already decide who gets CM, because once you reach 50 rep you have to request CM and I’ve seen people (and there is evidence in this topic to suggest) people wont always get it.</p>
<p>Let’s look at this logically, you’re saying you’re giving staff more power over who is given CM, therefore taking away more rights of the community to choose it’s elite.</p>
<p>There is no real solution to this because unlike Kaitnieks where we actually earned our rep, here we can obtain about 30 rep in 5 minutes if you’re respected enough for the guys on IRC to mass-rep you. Numerous examples of this, I don’t need to elaborate.</p>
<p>My solution, and it’s really not a solution but it is the best way to fix this up in my opinion. Close CM.</p>
<p>Call me an elitist all you want, but there’s no further good coming out of this community. In certain cases people could make topics if we truly believe someone deserves it (but if we get complete morons suggesting a nobody we’ll kick the eshit out of them).</p>
<p>The least you can do right now is kick; ``jason and the rest of the moparscapers out of this section and boost the rep needed for CM up to 100. Raise max rep to like 500 - I don’t even know why it needed capping on MITB. All current CMs wont require the 100 rep if they’ve been a CM for 3-6? months or longer.</p>
