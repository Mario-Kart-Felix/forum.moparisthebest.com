        <p>I write this post out of curiosity, and the fact I noticed how easy it is to obtain Community Member these days, does the rank not mean anything anymore? I remember when I first joined the RuneScape cheating scene, back on Kaitnieks (I think I only posted like twice, and they were asking how to make a server  :o), but I do remember seeing the Community Member but never really took notice until I joined mopar’s scene. I noticed it on frank_ first, and at that time I sort of realized how I would like to one day wear that rank under my name. It seems to be ever since Thug-life and myself have gotten access to this section, everyone has it.</p>
<p>By this I mean, ``jason, what has he ever done for the community? I saw that magma is near access, at 47 rep. Come on, <span class="bbcode-i">MAGMA?</span> All he does is post retarded posts about needed help with Java, heh, don’t get me wrong, I used to post WORSE than his questions, but I soon learned that I should not expect things written down in idiotic terms for me - I believe having frank_ on MSN taught me that more than anything, because we all know how he deals with idiots :P.</p>
<p>I am just throwing this out there, but we can perhaps do something to make it a little ‘tougher’ to get the Community Member rank, perhaps actually working for it, rather than asking people to rep you? I only wrote this post as it occurred to my mind, 2 years ago Community Member was actually something to be proud of, and meant something, now, it’s just as good as <span class="bbcode-i">Senior Member.</span></p>

        <p>This brings up a rather interesting situation.  As you say, you don’t believe magma is a considerable candidate for the position (additionally I’ve heard niall say that if frell was ever to reach 50 rep, he wouldn’t give him cm), so what is this showing the community?  People that are liked more then others, and are more popular would receive the position, while people who earned the reputation points like any other person, but don’t receive the position.  In my opinion, this isn’t exactly fair, and I’m sure some of you will agree.</p>

</aside>
<p>A system like:<br>
Warning = -2 Rep<br>
Moderation = -5 Rep<br>
Mute = -10 Rep</p>
<p>Or something along those lines.</p>
<p>Additionally, I don’t think that would be the best of ideas, seeing as it would involve with the constant removal and add of cm ranks as when warnings were given, that member would ask for rep from another member, and receive the rank.</p>
<p>Personally, the only possible situation would be to keep the current cm’s, and hold polls to vote in new candidates that have already reached 50 rep, just like the system over at moparscape.  It seems to be working there, so I don’t see why it wouldn’t here.  Votes would become more powerful, and meaningful.  This way, as a current cm, you have the full right to nominate new cm’s and decided whether or not they deserve the rank.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Tico135, post:7, topic:239281”]This brings up a rather interesting situation.  As you say, you don’t believe magma is a considerable candidate for the position (additionally I’ve heard niall say that if frell was ever to reach 50 rep, he wouldn’t give him cm), so what is this showing the community?  People that are liked more then others, and are more popular would receive the position, while people who earned the reputation points like any other person, but don’t receive the position.  In my opinion, this isn’t exactly fair, and I’m sure some of you will agree.</p>

Maybe a system where people lose reputation when they receive warnings could be of some use.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>A system like:<br>
Warning = -2 Rep<br>
Moderation = -5 Rep<br>
Mute = -10 Rep</p>
<p>Or something along those lines.</p>
<p>Additionally, I don’t think that would be the best of ideas, seeing as it would involve with the constant removal and add of cm ranks as when warnings were given, that member would ask for rep from another member, and receive the rank.</p>
<p>Personally, the only possible situation would be to keep the current cm’s, and hold polls to vote in new candidates that have already reached 50 rep, just like the system over at moparscape.  It seems to be working there, so I don’t see why it wouldn’t here.  Votes would become more powerful, and meaningful.  This way, as a current cm, you have the full right to nominate new cm’s and decided whether or not they deserve the rank.[/quote]<br>
You’re not a community member, you only have access to this section because you were given global moderator, I don’t believe you have any say in this (I am seriously not trying to be mean or anything).</p>

        <p>I’m sure we’d have a reputation floor (ie, 0 - reputation would not go into negatives).</p>
<p>And yeah, the voting works extremely well on Moparscape, so much so that only the very best make the rank now. This maintains the integrity of the rank as well as the value associated with it by ordinary members. Such a system could work here.</p>

<p>Anyway, I say when someone reaches the point in which their status changes to CM, a script should automatically post a yes/no poll in a new section in the CM boards (lasting 5 days) to see if someone will be granted access to this section. (Mopar will obviously have to write the script)</p>

        <p>[quote=“Uriko, post:17, topic:239281”]Community Member is nothing but a status anymore, there’s nothing good in this section to really hide from the community.</p>
<p>Anyway, I say when someone reaches the point in which their status changes to CM, a script should automatically post a yes/no poll in a new section in the CM boards (lasting 5 days) to see if someone will be granted access to this section. (Mopar will obviously have to write the script)[/quote]<br>
The script will crash frequently if it has something to do with these forums rifk.</p>

Actually Yz, he will receive community member when he decides to retire from his rank thereby making what he has to say no less valuable than what anyone else says.<br>

I have no troubles with Tico135 receiving Community Member when he retires, but I don’t see how he is a community member now.[/quote]<br>
He isn’t; he’s a staff member. Why would we exclude staff members (who are contributing their time to keep the forums clean) from sections like this? That’s rather rude.</p>

[/quote]me too, the community member forum does not require moderation and as such those undeserving should not be granted access (the same goes for any other sections ;))[/quote]<br>
Anyone contributing to the cleanliness and smooth running of the forum is more than deserving of access to this section.</p>
