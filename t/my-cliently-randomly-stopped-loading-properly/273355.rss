    <description>Everything was fine until yesterday.  It just randomly doesn&#39;t load right.  It takes at least 10 minutes to pull up the login screen, and it&#39;s laggy as anything when I log in.  But it&#39;s only on this one computer for some reason...  If I go to another computer and use, it&#39;s fine.  The runbox doesn&#39;t say anything, but it&#39;s just really weird.  Any ideas?


Thanks.</description>
