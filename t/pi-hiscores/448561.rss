    <description>I added the hiscores page to my server,
But when i go open the hiscore page i can view it but when my players open it they say they cant view it, that its loading to long. I&#39;m not sure what to do at this point. I&#39;ve tryed to fix it but they still have the same results as they had before.</description>
