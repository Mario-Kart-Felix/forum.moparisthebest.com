    <title>I get all the drops?!?!?!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-get-all-the-drops/297891</link>
    <description>My brother and my friend have been helping me test my server. One of the problems I have encountered is I  get all the drops no matter what. Even if I don&#39;t attack the NPC.

I searched google, RuneServe, and all over these forums and cannot find the solution...

Does anyone know what file(s) I can edit to fix this? And if you know what to edit?

I&#39;m using Bulby source. (508 server)

Thanks,

Well thats a thing i know, Bulby doesnt have a npcdrops.cfg it runs off i think Player or Client.java<br>
Search for a Tut that tells u how to Create a Npcdrops.cfg for 508</p>
