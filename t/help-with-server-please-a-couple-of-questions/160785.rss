    <description> :eek: :eek:OMFG!!!!

I have followed every tutorial and every download - jdk 6.3 and all that stuff..latest version of java too!

Moporscape is the only thing i can get working right...
What i want to learn is how to get my friends on my moparscape server without having to download no-ip because it sucks. 
2 much lagg  lol

by the way i would really appreciate it too

i either get a page that says you dont have the latest jdk go to mod taharoks page...


or i get something like 
&#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command...

I&#39;ve used almost every server on moparscape

...

i really need help i think i need to reinstall moparscape and edit it..

im just trying to make my own server :(

I wanted to make like the best server ever... i understand java im probley 3/10 of the way there too


i can open all my files perfectley...
