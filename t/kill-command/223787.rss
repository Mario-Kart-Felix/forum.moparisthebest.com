<p>You could have downloaded a server with the command ::eat as it does the same thing (figmenscape).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for a ::kill command basically add in command under all other ones, the declare the if command starts with kill and is more than 4 chars long (for the word and space) then playerDeath (might not be the same in other sources as iâ€™m naming it from my own source) == true for playerName.</p>
</li>
