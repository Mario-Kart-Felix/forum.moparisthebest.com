    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/helpful-coords-program/335545</link>
    <description>Hiya If this is in the wrong place move it.
Anyways today i release a program that most of you Private sever builders like. OK we all know coords is what makes a sever a sever that and pvp. Anyways This is coded in visual basic 06 so its not that perfect :) The only flaws are that it doesn&#39;t have [shadow=red,left]ALL[/shadow] the coords in the list but it has a lot that are important in putting a sever together.

Here are some pictures of the program i am releasing.

If you have more town coords please list them :D Seeing how im a non-member on runescape and im too lazy to look at the runescape map there is that.

Ahh yes, This is my friends sever in which i am a admin there so i pretty much had a left over tab except credits and music as you can see in the bottom. The music is inside the program so when you close it, it will shut off plus you can lower the sound and stop the music if you don&#39;t like it.

Guilds, Alters, And Favorite coords of everyone. This is the most visited tab by me. It was once named Zomgs coords But seeing how im publicly releasing here you go!
