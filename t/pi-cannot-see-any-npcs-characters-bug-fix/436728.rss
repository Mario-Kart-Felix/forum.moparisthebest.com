    <title>[Pi]Cannot see any npc&#39;s/characters bug fix?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-cannot-see-any-npcs-characters-bug-fix/436728</link>
    <description>Hello, before you read this thread I&#39;m wondering if you have the fix for this if you don&#39;t theres no point in reading this etc and it&#39;ll save you time not reading this.

According to one of the posts by another user the issue is in player.java but this isn&#39;t verified.
The link to the release thread is below
http://www.[imtired]rune-[makemeasammich]server.[pie]org/runescape-development/rs2-server/downloads/283112-pi-asgarnia-server-fullscreen-compatible.html

If not its cool, not a high priority or anything although it&#39;d be nice to play around with. I haven&#39;t even downloaded it due to the fact I doubt I can fix it on my own and I&#39;m on a limited bandwidth until my internet gets sorted out soon&#39;ish so I&#39;d rather not download unnecessary data.
Cannot post errors etc due to not having a copy of it.</description>
