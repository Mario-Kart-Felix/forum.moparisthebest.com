    <title>What would be better?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-would-be-better/549881</link>
    <description>Today I came to an idea where I&#39;d clear the entire process, and load everything individually on player log-in using Event Manager. Such as player saving, special attack regeneration etc. Is this a bad idea and I should just leave the process crammed with everything?

<p>I was just thinking of making each thing have it’s own void, and timer.</p>
<p>Processing everything individually, with different timers so it’s not bunched up together.</p>
<p>Process special attack.<br>
Process regeneration.<br>
Process player saving.</p>
