    <title>Question about a party</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-a-party/533774</link>
    <description>I was wondering if I could be charged for anything (get in trouble in any form) if I went to an underage drinking party, but did not consume any alcohol myself. Basically, I would just go to the party and not drink. Would I be able to get in any trouble for just being there?</description>

Yeah I didn’t live there. I was living off-campus and most of my work was collaborated through Blackboard. I still went too Red Room occasionally, you’re probably right we may of seen one another at one point, hah</p>

<p>Haha I’m actually joking, I don’t <span class="bbcode-b">always</span> go to underage parties. It’s really not that creepy like I make it out too be, but it’s different here in Australia, mostly I’m just joking.</p>
<p>Here our culture kind of has a age group, half of the ones from about 16-21 usually all party together at the local house party, and the other half goes into “town” (you guys refer to it as ‘clubbing’ I believe). 99% of people around my age usually do one or the other, but I personally prefer going to house parties over clubbing. It’s also very different because there’s no ‘college’ parties here, our ‘college’ party is cheap vodka drinks at a night club on “Uni night” (every Wednesday night), that’s about as far as it goes for ‘college’ parties.</p>
<p>Also, underage is anyone under 16 in Aus, so it’s not necessarily ‘underage’ partying.[/quote]</p>
<p>Gotcha. I learned something today.</p>

[/quote]I live at college in Brisbane and it’s quite different than you describe. All the colleges at UQ throw a heap of events each week, minimum of like three. Some of those are exchanges to nightclubs, but a lot are parties at each other’s residential colleges.[/quote]<br>

<p>Here our culture kind of has a age group, half of the ones from about 16-21 usually all party together at the local house party, and the other half goes into “town” (you guys refer to it as ‘clubbing’ I believe). 99% of people around my age usually do one or the other, but I personally prefer going to house parties over clubbing. It’s also very different because there’s no ‘college’ parties here, our ‘college’ party is cheap vodka drinks at a night club on “Uni night” (every Wednesday night), that’s about as far as it goes for ‘college’ parties.</p>
<p>Also, underage is anyone under 16 in Aus, so it’s not necessarily ‘underage’ partying.[/quote]I live at college in Brisbane and it’s quite different than you describe. All the colleges at UQ throw a heap of events each week, minimum of like three. Some of those are exchanges to nightclubs, but a lot are parties at each other’s residential colleges.</p>
