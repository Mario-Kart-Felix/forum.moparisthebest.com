    <description>Ok, so i need help with the npc talking to you, and you talking back to them.

this is the code for someone with the skillcape shop...

[code]if(npc.getId() == 2270) {
p.turnTemporarilyTo(npc);
npc.turnTemporarilyTo(p);
skillCapeHandler.initiateSpeech(p, 2270, 200, &quot;Martin Thwait&quot;, &quot;Soo, I hear you might be sneaky?&quot;);
}[/code]

i want to write that but with the npc id being 599 and having talking to that npc you come up with these options....

Npc:You want me to fix your uglyness?

You: I&#39;m not That ugly!..Sure
or
You:No! Go Away!

I have Some clue on how to write it but i still need some help.</description>
