    <title>Should drugs be legal?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-drugs-be-legal/47724</link>
    <description>Well I was watching the Colbert Report the other day, and Stephan interviewd someone (I forgot their name) and debating on weather drugs should be legal, the person he was interviewing said that they should first start by legalizing marijuana, he thought that the fact of people getting locked up for doing it was wrong.

He wanted to treat marijuana like alcahol bassicaly.Stephan of course as always made the crowd laugh by embarrasing him (well that&#39;s realy not the point in this debate).Well post your thoughts here on weather it should be legalized or not.

I&#39;ll start by saying it should not be legalized, if people treat it like they do in D.U.I then they would be killing people which they still will be getting locked up for.</description>

<p>No. You get robbed on the street because of failing drug policy. If drugs were regulated, not only would the chance of an addict existing become less in the first place, much better solutions to help addicts could exist. Addicts simply cannot be helped at the moment, the law is too restrictive. A heroin addict can go out and get a job and contribute to society if he has heroin - so why can’t we give him heroin? What’s better, an addict stealing to support a habit, or an addict that has a government-sponsored habit who is leading a proper life?</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:44, topic:47724”]im not idealistic, like the people saying ‘weed does [insert harmful thing]’</p>
<p>it doesnt matter how dangerous or safe drugs are, they are addictive, people need money to get them, they turn to crime (or selling themselves for sex sometimes)[/quote]</p>
<p>Actually, you are saying that, because you are saying “drugs” are addictive. Not all drugs are addictive. Weed is not addictive. There is no differentiation between “mental” and “physical” addiction like Freevibe would have you believe - the brain is physical after all. When people say “mental addiction” they are referring to habituation, which is not limited to drugs at all. In this case, I am mentally addicted to the internet, the internet is therefore dangerous and should be banned. Addiction is a recordable, chemical occurance that only a certain amount of drugs cause, certainly not all of them.</p>
<p>As Pault has already said, “people need money to get them” is really an argument for legalisation. I forgot the numbers, but it was figured out for a BBC report that, if heroin was legalised and controlled by the government, the NHS would be able to produce an unbelievable amount very cheaply, simply because they have much more resources available to them than illegal drug dealers. There would be no need to turn to crime.</p>
<p>If you take nothing else from what I say, at least understand this: I do not want drugs legalised because I believe they are safe, I want them legalised because I recognise that they are dangerous. In the current state, a dangerous market is in the hands of criminals. It dosen’t matter what anybody says, I believe and will always believe, that a dangerous market is better off in the hands of regulated authority than criminals.</p>

<p>Uh, actually meth-rage leads to alot of violent deaths. If drugs were legalized, the government could limit the amount of speed people take in 24 hour periods, make sure people know what they are taking, and ensure that those expirementing with possibly dangerous substances like crystal meth have sober-ish friends around.</p>

<p>No, less would happen. If drugs were cheap and plentiful, why would anyone rob to get them? There would probably be a great increase in overdose and death due to intoxication, but as idiots get weeded out it would happen less and less.[/quote]</p>

<p>Alcohol is one of the most dangerous drugs there is. If you compare alcohol to acid, shrooms, marijuana, salvia, or other common psychadelics, alcohol is in fact much more dangerous than these illegal drugs.</p>

Actually I am pretty sure you can smoke shrooms, but the smoke makes you go blind or something. Don’t quote me on that.</p>
<p>Also, in holland they don’t have all drugs legalized afaik. “soft” drugs are legal, “hard” drugs are not. I know that weed and shrooms are both legal though. I don’t know how they classify what is hard and what is soft.</p>
