    <title>Quite a Few things I need help with</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quite-a-few-things-i-need-help-with/419726</link>
    <description>1) The server I downloaded was already coded some and tested by a bunch of people I assume, because there are already many characters made. One of which is owner of the server, Regisoul. I give him Power=0 and my character Speakmore power=3 and I become owner. But here is the weird part. When you log in as Regisoul, it says the Owner has logged in blah blah blah in the chat bar. He also can use the I guess Owner only commands, ::mypos specifically, even though he doesn&#39;t have power, nor a crown. So is there any way I can change this? I&#39;ve already went into my source and editted everything under his name and replaced it with Speakmore in the Source file

2) How do I change the starter items you get. This server was supposed to be pk/eco, I want it to be spawn and pk obviously.

3) How do I allow players to spawn, infact, I myself, can&#39;t even spawn as Admin (even on Regisoul.    Is the code ::item 1 1 or something?) After they can spawn, how can I limit it so they can&#39;t spawn what is in the shops that I&#39;m going to make

4) Mini-games were already created, I want to change it I guess, so they aren&#39;t there. Is there a file I can delete to do so?

5) How do I change my teleports, so if I want to make a SKilling tele into tele to like, fally, because I don&#39;t need skilling in a spawn server.

6) How do I change the items in the shops, the NPC&#39;s name, and how many pkp it is going to cost?

That will be all for now as I will want to complete this first before moving on to the other stuff.... I&#39;m extremely new to coding, as I only opened up this stuff yesterday. IF you guys could help me out, that would be amazing. But basically I&#39;m almost asking you to code the server for me sadly, but I can&#39;t find any other way to understand where to change this stuff at.

Sorry for all the work, but thanks to all of you who can/will help.</description>

<p>Indeed, I mean look at Jagex, just giving an example, we are working off of their work that they created from scratch and look at them now. It may have taken them some time but they have came far from RuneScape Classic.</p>
