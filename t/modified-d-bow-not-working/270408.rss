    <title>Modified D bow not working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/modified-d-bow-not-working/270408</link>
    <description>I want to make a D bow type thing for mods only on my server that doesn&#39;t use arrows and shoots 4 &quot;arrows&quot; at a time, each one equal to the stat bonuses of a rune arrow. I decided to take it a step at a time and make it with shooting 2 arrows at a time and shooting real arrows first but I can&#39;t seem to even do this. Even when I went and copied every normal D Bow code and put in my ID, 14493, it didn&#39;t work. I attacked my client.java. Tell me if you need anything else.</description>

I tried setting everything in my client that was set at 4837 to 14493 and it worked as a normal d bow. But how do I get both to work??</p>
