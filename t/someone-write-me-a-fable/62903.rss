          <blockquote>
              <p>[quote=“Ollie, post:3, topic:62903”]So many years ago in the Andes mountains a small cat and dog became very good friends. The dog, Delta, and the cat, Echo, had an interesting life. This is their story, told in my words, and relived in many.</p>
<p>As Delta ran in after his morning cup of tea that he always had looking over the valley far below he started to tell Echo of the wonderful news that he had herd…“Echo, Echo, I can’t believe it if what they say is true they have struck gold and silver over the next mountain. The entire valley is all at a buzz about it and they are all packing up to come over this mountain.” Echo, who was very flabbergasted by this time and didn’t know what the sagnifigance of this story that Delta was telling her was, stood up and started to pat her now hyperventilating friend, Delta, on the back. “Okay, Delta, okay what is the big deal maybe we will have some company.” “No, you don’t understand what this means It will take them all at least two days to get up this mountain and they leave tomorrow. If we leave now we would be able to get to the gold all for ourselves. We’ll split it down the middle fifty-fifty before anyone even gets there.” “I’ll pack our lunches.”</p>
<p>The two packed a few neccasary belongings and rushed out the door of their small cottage hoping that they would never have to come back for the riches they would find would allow them to buy a much bigger house to live in the lap of luxury. They walked hand in hand up over this mountain, They were the best of friends. After a while of walking they decided to rest for the night and set up camp. After they drank their hot chocolate the lied down and tried to go to sleep. Thoughts were to wild for them to settle and thoughts of the riches they would both enjoy and then the wild thoughts started to turn to envy. And each one started thinking that the other would try to get all the gold for theirselves and not share. Instead of sleeping they both slowly started to plan the others death.</p>
<p>Neither one spoke when they awoke and they walked slowly on. then the plots for each ones death slowly started to unravel Echo saw the poisonous flower that she had known grew on the mountain and she, without notice, swiftly moved over to the low purple flower and with one small bound picked up the flower and with evil eyes held the tender flower between her claws careful not to bleed the flower, and poison herself.</p>
<p>That night when they arrived at their camp site and both slept on opposite sides. Echo boiled some water… Then in the morning Echo offered Delta a nice cup of tea. Little did Delta know that the night before Echo had spent the night boiling the flower and secreting the poisonous venom like oil. As Delta sipped his death, Echo started to regret her actions of the night before and reached out to snatch the brawl out of Delta’s hands. …It was too late… Delta had consumed the entire drink and now slowly started to drift off to sleep. Echo, now realizing that she would be loosing her best friend started to yell and scream at Delta to keep him awake. Echo held Delta in her arms and started to sob. Never had she ever expected to actually kill her best friend and the fact that it was over gold brought her to tears. Gold that she would now never find. Echo could not believe that her eyes of green had seen her best friend die. And now that she looked down and saw her breathless best friend she picked up the cup and carefully licked the cup clean and slowly poisoned herself. In the sacrifice she made of Delta she then sacrificed her life to apologize to Delta in the after life.[/quote]</p>
<p>And the moral is?</p>
