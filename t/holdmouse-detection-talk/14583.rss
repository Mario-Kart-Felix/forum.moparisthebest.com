    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/holdmouse-detection-talk/14583</link>
    <description>Hello there ladies and gents.

Some people claim that using hold-mouse/release-mouse is detectable and banned. However. I dont see how that can be possible.

But I CAN see how you can use this fucntion &quot;wrongly&quot;, thus getting yourself banned. Look at my first example to see a classic detected  procedure.

  
HoldMouse(x, y, true);
Wait(50);
ReleaseMouse(x, y, true);

The static wait could easely be detected. But thats not all, my next example is also likely to get detected. Altho not static.
 
HoldMouse(x, y, true);
Wait(5)+random(5);
ReleaseMouse(x, y, true);

I belive this can be detected aswell. As in the longrun, its unlikely that any human can manage to hold the mouse down for a so little period of time. I did a series of tests. And i found out that a human on average hold down the mouse atleast for 50miliseconds on each click. 

However, i did find out that the whole holdmouse function was flawed. As the  HoldMouse function get a strange -1x every time it is used.

You can see for yourself if you call this little script.
   
repeat
GetMousePos(x, y);
HoldMouse(x, y, true);
wait(40 + random(20))
ReleaseMouse(x, y, true);
until(isFKeyDown(9))

You will find your mouse is sliding to the left. Altho NO position modifyers are in the script. Offcourse that can somehow be used to detect when the function is beeing used.

However adding a +1 fixes up that flaw: 
HoldMouse(x+1, y, true);

Now, with that flaw fixed. And armed with the knowledge that a human will not be able to hold down the mouse for less time than 30ms, it should realy be possible to make this function not detectable?  

Somthing like this:
 
  GetMousePos(x, y);
  HoldMouse(x+1, y, true);
  wait(50 + random(30));
  ReleaseMouse(x, y, true);

You could even ?improve? it more doing something like this:
 
Procedure dryclick;
Begin
  Status(&#39;Clicking&#39;);
  GetMousePos(x, y);
  xx:=x+random(2)+1;
  xx:=xx-random(2);
  yy:=y+random(2);
  yy:=yy-random(2);
  HoldMouse(x+1, y, true);
  wait(30 + random(20));
  MoveMouseSmoothEx(xx, yy, 1, 5, 2, 10, 5);
  wait(30 + random(20));
  ReleaseMouse(x, y, true);
End;


Now what do you think? I will do some tests and run them a weeks time on some newbies. To see if i get banned or not.

(DONT flame this topic, keep the hating away)

              <p>After some research i found out it was already in the SRL function “Mouse”. (a srl function that moves the mouse, then clicks it)</p>
<p>However it was not included in the function “CMouse”. (The main srl clickmouse function)</p>
<p>I have made a very basic and small include file called “dryBasic” that is ultra-fast to load, and have the clicking procedure and a basic (still undetectable) talking procedure in it. I will put it up in my signature shortly. Maybe it is interesting for some?</p>

HoldMouse and ReleaseMouse. If you are doing a doubleclick and forget to add in a decent amount of wait between the release mouse and the start of the hold mouse agen. As you need atleast (assumingly) 40ms wait.</p>

<p>You have a good point with all that.   I don’t think anybody else noticed that the holdmouse and releasemouse had a flaw.</p>
