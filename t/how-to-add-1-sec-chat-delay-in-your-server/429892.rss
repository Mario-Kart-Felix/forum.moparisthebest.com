              <p>I don’t really understand what you mean by a chat delay.   suppose if you meant like regular chat, then you would have to go to client.java and search for case 4:  It will have the words “regular chat” commented out right by the top.</p>
<p>To make it easier, I would copy the first if statement which has to do with if a person is muted then make another if statement under it like:</p>
<p><code> if (chatTimer &gt; 1)
{
break;
}
</code></p>
<p>I put &gt; 1 because process() is called every 500ms so if it’s called twice then it is about 1 second (although process() is not very accurate for timing)</p>
<p>That should make it so nothing happens, but you’d have to initialize the variable chatTimer or whatever you were gonna use first up at the top.</p>
<p>Under that would be the statement that actually works so at the end of that statement you would need to set the chatTimer variable to 2.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int chatTimer = 0;</code></pre>
<p>Then you would need to add this statement in process():</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (chatTimer &gt; 0)
{
chatTimer -= ;
}</code></pre>
<p>If you still don’t get it just pm me, this is not very organized in the least bit, but if you’re comfortable in java you should have no problem putting it in.</p>
