    <title>[Help Me] Port Forwarding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-port-forwarding/188554</link>
    <description>Yes, this seems like the most PAINFUL thing to do when creating a server. But here is the deal.

I used: PortForward.com just like advertised in the &quot;How to make a server&quot; tuturial. I&#39;ve found my router.

Now it gives me a list of things that I need to chose to Forward a Port from it.

WHAT THE HECK DO I USE LOL?

Someone PLEASE! help me!

If I get helped, I&#39;ll erase all this, put the general question and then leave the thread alone for others to see the answers left.

Please help :)</description>
