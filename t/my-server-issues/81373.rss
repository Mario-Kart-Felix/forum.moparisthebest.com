[b]Some  Probloms.[/b]
I am going ot make the server hosted on 2 computers. running linux. Because ive eard and experienced that vista is not very good for hosting things.
But Some Things I Am haveing trouble with are,

If i leave the server on for a long time it will crash. with weird errors. how can i fix that. and sometimes i will get a java heap error? does that mean to many people on the server?
And Also Is it possible for anyone to fix my client so it will run on any computer werever you copy and paste it. without mopars cache.  and to make it so that it will automadicly download the cache. from my website.

so if anyone could please help me with my client issues. not so much server issues i would appreciate it extremly.


Edit:
