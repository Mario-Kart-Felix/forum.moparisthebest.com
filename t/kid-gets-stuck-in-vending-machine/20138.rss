    <description>Sorry Ron, lol. Had to post this xD

&lt;blockquote&gt;Toddler gets stuck in vending machine
	
ANTIGO, Wis. (AP) -- Three-year-old Robert Moore went fishing for a stuffed replica of Sponge Bob and ended up trapped in a vending machine. The toddler&#39;s adventure began with a Saturday evening shopping trip with his grandmother, Fredricka Bierdemann, and three siblings.

Bierdemann ended the trip by giving each child a dollar and telling them to have fun in a retailer&#39;s game room.

A stuffed Sponge Bob in a vending machine&#39;s bin caught Robert&#39;s eye. He tried without success to fish it out with a plastic crane.

&quot;I told him I could get it for him,&quot; his grandmother said. &quot;He&#39;s a character. He said, &#39;Oh no, I can get it.&#39;&quot;
	
	

When she turned her back to get another dollar for a second try, Robert took off his coat and squeezed through an opening in the machine. He landed in the stuffed animal cube.

&quot;I turned around and looked for him, and he said, &#39;Oma, I&#39;m in here,&quot; Bierdemann said. &quot;I thought I would have a heart attack.&quot;

Store employees couldn&#39;t find a key to the machine, so Robert waited while the Antigo Fire Department was called.

&quot;He was having a ball in there, hugging all the stuffed animals,&quot; Bierdemann said. &quot;He was so good-natured, but I was shaking like a leaf.&quot;
	

Firefighters broke one lock but then spotted two latches inside the plastic cube. They passed a screwdriver to Robert.

&quot;He stacked up all the stuffed animals and used that screwdriver to open the latch,&quot; his grandmother said. &quot;You should have seen him go.&quot;

Eventually, Robert freed himself. But his mother, Marie Moore, and grandmother said they were lucky that he remained calm when another child might not have. He went home safe - but without a stuffed Sponge Bob.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<blockquote>Toddler gets stuck in vending machine
<p>ANTIGO, Wis. (AP) – Three-year-old Robert Moore went fishing for a stuffed replica of Sponge Bob and ended up trapped in a vending machine. The toddler’s adventure began with a Saturday evening shopping trip with his grandmother, Fredricka Bierdemann, and three siblings.</p>
<p>Bierdemann ended the trip by giving each child a dollar and telling them to have fun in a retailer’s game room.</p>
<p>A stuffed Sponge Bob in a vending machine’s bin caught Robert’s eye. He tried without success to fish it out with a plastic crane.</p>
<p>“I told him I could get it for him,” his grandmother said. “He’s a character. He said, ‘Oh no, I can get it.’”</p>
<p>When she turned her back to get another dollar for a second try, Robert took off his coat and squeezed through an opening in the machine. He landed in the stuffed animal cube.</p>
<p>“I turned around and looked for him, and he said, 'Oma, I’m in here,” Bierdemann said. “I thought I would have a heart attack.”</p>
<p>Store employees couldn’t find a key to the machine, so Robert waited while the Antigo Fire Department was called.</p>
<p>“He was having a ball in there, hugging all the stuffed animals,” Bierdemann said. “He was so good-natured, but I was shaking like a leaf.”</p>
<p>Firefighters broke one lock but then spotted two latches inside the plastic cube. They passed a screwdriver to Robert.</p>
<p>“He stacked up all the stuffed animals and used that screwdriver to open the latch,” his grandmother said. “You should have seen him go.”</p>
<p>Eventually, Robert freed himself. But his mother, Marie Moore, and grandmother said they were lucky that he remained calm when another child might not have. He went home safe - but without a stuffed Sponge Bob.</p>
