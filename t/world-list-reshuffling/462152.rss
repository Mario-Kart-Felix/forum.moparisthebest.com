    <title>World list reshuffling</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/world-list-reshuffling/462152</link>
    <description>Okay a while ago I read somewhere that to prevent players having an unfair advantage of being updated before an opponent whilst PK&#39;ing, that RuneScape randomly shuffles the world list (and hence the player&#39;s index within the game world).

Apparently people were using modded clients that showed their world index and the potential difference in theirs to others. Now while this has little concern in private servers, I wrote a small method to do this, but I fear it is way to costly performance wise. So go ahead and write something more elegant if you wish. I thought it would be interesting to discuss how they did this, whether they still do it and what implications it had on RuneScape&#39;s servers performance.

[code=java]public void shuffle() {
    List&lt;Player&gt; playerList = Arrays.asList(players);
    Collections.shuffle(playerList);
    players = new Player[CAPACITY];
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; playerList.size(); i++) {
        Player player = playerList.get(i);
        players[player.setIndex(i)] = player;
    }
}[/code]</description>

              <p>Yeah you’re right, I didn’t think of that. I suppose it would be extremely wasteful to reorder the world list when you can only see players in the local list.</p>
