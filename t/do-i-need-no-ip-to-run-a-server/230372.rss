    <title>Do I NEED no-ip to run a server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/do-i-need-no-ip-to-run-a-server/230372</link>
    <description>What I just tried to do is not use No-IP [im on a dif comp], and I ran the client, and it wouldnt log me in. I was trying to connect with MY IP ADDRESS, and it didnt work.

When I tried 127.0.0.1, of course it worked. So, my question, without No-IP, can I not run a server?</description>

              <p>It depends what type of IP address you have.</p>
<p>There are 2 types, Dynamic and Static.</p>
<p>A Dynamic IP address is assigned by your ISP every time you connect to the internet which means that every time you connect you are likely to have a new IP meaning you WILL need No-IP</p>
<p>A Static IP is specifically assigned to you and is always the same meaning that if your server is running that IP can always be used to connect so you DONT need No-Ip</p>
<p>So basically it depends what type you have.</p>
