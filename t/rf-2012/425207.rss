    <title>Rf 2012</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rf-2012/425207</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Hot on the heels of Runefest 2011, we’re excitedly readying ourselves for Runefest 2012 as it comes thundering into view. With the conclusion of our recent poll on where you would like to see RuneFest 2012 held, we’re already a big step closer to what will be the biggest and best RuneFest yet.

The poll asked whether you’d like to see RuneFest 2012 held somewhere new like Chicago, Los Angeles or New York or back in our home town of London.

A huge thanks to the 100,000 of you who voted in the poll which saw New York narrowly beat our home town of London by just 4% (34% to 30%).

The poll results don’t confirm where RuneFest 2012 will be held as there are a lot of factors and feedback to take into consideration, but it’s vital information that’s going to really help us plan out the best RuneFest 2012 ever.

Now it’s time for the RuneFest team to lock ourselves away and review and start planning what RuneFest 2012 is going to look like and, of course, where it’s going to be held. You can expect to hear more from us in the new year!

Until then, thanks again for voting in the poll and a Merry Christmas to you all from the RuneFest team.

The RuneFest Team&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hopefully Jagex goes with the poll results and we&#39;ll have a rf in America :o

How many of you would go if it is in your country?</description>

              <p>Even though it was voted to be in NY, I have a feeling that Jagex will have it in LA… It just seems like all video game conventions end up in LA, you don’t usually hear of many in NY, I don’t anyways lol</p>
