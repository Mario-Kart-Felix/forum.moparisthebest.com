    <title>Excl is gone</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/excl-is-gone/440206</link>
    <description>So I was bored today sort of so I went on to youtube to watch some of my old favorites. I had no idea that Excl had quit recently. Apparently about a week/two week ago he just ...literally vanished off the map. Nobody has seen him, both of his channels are gone, his facebook is gone, etc.</description>

              <p>So I was bored today sort of so I went on to youtube to watch some of my old favorites. I had no idea that Excl had quit recently. Apparently about a week/two week ago he just …literally vanished off the map. Nobody has seen him, both of his channels are gone, his facebook is gone, etc.</p>
