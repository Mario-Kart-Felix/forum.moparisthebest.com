    <title>German Ghost Car Commercial GOST CAUGHT ON TAPE!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/german-ghost-car-commercial-gost-caught-on-tape/38588</link>
    <description>&quot;This is is a car advertisement from Germany . When they finished filming the ad, the people who made it, noticed something moving along the side of the car, like a ghostly white mist.

If you turn up the sound, you can also hear whispering. The ad was never put on TV because the unexplained ghostly phenomenon frightened the production team out of their wits. Watch it and about halfway through (after the car comes from behind the trees) look closely and you will see the white mist coming up from behind the car and then following it along the road!&quot;  



read that than watch this!!!

<p>I agree with you half. People do post movies like this over and over. But, this one is actually not really edited like that. It is a movie…well…you’ll see if you watched it…ya…but people use the search before you post another topic about something <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> I’m sure this has been posted before <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>"This is is a car advertisement from Germany . When they finished filming the ad, the people who made it, noticed something moving along the side of the car, like a ghostly white mist.</p>
<p>If you turn up the sound, you can also hear whispering. The ad was never put on TV because the unexplained ghostly phenomenon frightened the production team out of their wits. Watch it and about halfway through (after the car comes from behind the trees) look closely and you will see the white mist coming up from behind the car and then following it along the road!"</p>
<p>read that than watch this!!!<br>
