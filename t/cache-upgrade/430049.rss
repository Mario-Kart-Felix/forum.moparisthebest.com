    <title>Cache upgrade</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-upgrade/430049</link>
    <description>I added a few models and ofc only I can see them yet..

But I rejarred and changed the cache in cachedownloader etc to my new cache.

but I doesn&#39;t upgrade the cache for others..

Maybe if they delete the cache,, but I can&#39;t tell my whole server to delete the cache..

how to upgrade it for everybody without delete the cache?</description>
