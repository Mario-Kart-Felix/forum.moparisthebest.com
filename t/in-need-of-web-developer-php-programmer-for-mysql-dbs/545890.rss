    <description>[center]Ok I&#39;m trying not to give anything away here as this is going to be a big release but tackling it by myself has proven to be somewhat difficult.[/center]

Server description:
Base: 317 (Niobe source)
Loading 667 textures
Working membership system
Next generation slaying system
All skills 100% working
Custom gfx &amp; animations
Fully working bank tabs &amp; bank system
100% working price checker

and much much more...


[i][b]What I require[/b][/i]

I require someone with a lot of php and mysql experience capable of executing simple tasks such as a login system through the server to an sql database.
I&#39;ve spent a lot of time working on this server and I&#39;m only looking for 1 [i]&#39;team-mate&#39;[/i]. If you see yourself the ideal candidate then I&#39;d love to hear from you.
