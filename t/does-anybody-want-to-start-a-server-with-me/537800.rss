    <title>Does anybody want to start a server with me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anybody-want-to-start-a-server-with-me/537800</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve tried port forwarding several times, and it never works on any of my computers. I&#39;ve tried at my friends house, ETC and still nothing. I cannot port forward for seemingly any game, even minecraft! So I&#39;ve given up home on hosting my own, but I would love it if someone hosted it for me, or wanted to do a dual partnership type deal. I&#39;ll make and host the website for the server, and you make and host the game (I honestly couldn&#39;t care less about the decisions you make about the game). The only thing I&#39;d ask is that in-game I become a mod/admin. If you will help me with this, please PM me and I&#39;ll send you a link where we can discuss more plans.

ALSO: I know a lot of you are going to say &quot;BUY A VPS YOU CHEAP NUB&quot;. I&#39;ve honestly considered doing that, but I don&#39;t know how to code an RSPS anyway, so buying one would be pointless (as I couldn&#39;t even maintain it). I would be wasting money on a VPS that I can&#39;t even use. 

Anyway, thanks!
