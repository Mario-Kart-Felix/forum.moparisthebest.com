    <title>Help with Pickup command please!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-pickup-command-please/222935</link>
    <description>Well, on my server i already have a pick-up command, but only i and the co-owner can use it (playerrights 3)

But, its on playerrights 2, but didnt work, same with ::xrichie for max cash, only owners can use it, but i just made a new other command, so that was easy... should i make a new one with pickup?? just make the command and put all the things it says under it?

Or if u know what is wrong, please help me. 

Thanks in the future, Maxie35.</description>
