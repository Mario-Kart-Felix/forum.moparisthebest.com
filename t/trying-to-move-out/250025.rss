    <title>Trying to move out</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trying-to-move-out/250025</link>
    <description>Ok, i am trying to move into my own place and am having issues with costs. 

At the moment, my total bills per week are $100. this includes car costs, telephone bills and petrol.

i would estimate that that i would go thru absalutly no more than $100 on weekly lunch during work and an outing once a week.

so, far, that is $200 in expenses. Leaving me with $440 a week out of my wages. 

Now, renting a place to live would be likely to cost me somewhere in the range of $200 to $300. Leaving me with around $150. Minus the cost of food, and ill be lucky to have $50 left. 



Now i am lucky enough to have a job that pays more than minimum wage... but i cannot seem to scrape much money after i calculate all my bills... how the hell do people survive on such little money? I want to own my own house eventualy... but being able to save less than $100 a week... it would take me decades to even save up for the deposit...</description>

<li>college doesnt mean you get a better job, it just means you spend 5+ years spending money to listen to someone talk.</li>
<li>a better job… im at the peak of entry jobs. A better job than what i have would prolly need me to spend a year or so working in the same job to get promoted.</li>
<li>I applied once… apparently i was ‘too qualified’ to be someone that shoots mindlessly at things… so i guess im stuck being a lover, not a fighter.</li>

Moving out on your own is tough.  When I first moved out, I lived with 2 other people and at the end of the month, after all my expenses, was lucky to have a surplus of $10.  You just have to do the best you can, welcome to life.<br>
