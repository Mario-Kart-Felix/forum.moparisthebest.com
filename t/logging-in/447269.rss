    <description>Hey, I am posting because I need a little help :P, My server is online, Working.. One person connected today because my rsps is new and I have noticed I cannot log onto my server with them on No-ip.. I was wondering how because I though if i changed to localhost and then compiled it wouldn&#39;t all the other player&#39;s on my server get dc&#39;ed and then they cannot play but then only I can play. 

I am abit confused on how, Leave comment to help :)</description>
