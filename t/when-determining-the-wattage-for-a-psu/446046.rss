    <title>When determining the wattage for a PSU</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/when-determining-the-wattage-for-a-psu/446046</link>
    <description>When determining the wattage for a PSU do you add the needs of each component? So if my graphics card alone needs 500 watts then should I add to that the watts that my other components need (such as my CPU which requires 125 watts)?I&#39;ve been having a lot of issues with this PC that I shouldn&#39;t be, and this is the last thing I can think of. It crashes when I play minecraft of all things. My computer will blame it on the driver for my graphics card for failing to reset after a crash, but I&#39;ve already had the card replaced. My current PSU is only 500 watts, will upgrading to a higher watt PSU fix the issue or do you think something else is going on here?</description>

<p>Realistically you can run any non-dual gpu solution on 500W easily.</p>

<p>I have been updating my drivers constantly. I changed the card to see if there was something wrong with it, I just recently updated the driver and it still crashes…</p>
