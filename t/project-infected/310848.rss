    <description>[b]About the Project[/b]

Well this is a brand new project, that i have decided to start because my friend wants to host. It&#39;s a 508 and my goal is to make it different. Different locations, different way to raise skills, just make it completley different. I realize that i cannot do this on my own, and that is why i am posting to look for a developement team.

[b]Things to add[/b]

I&#39;ve added enough for a start but i would like to add the following

1. A couple of minigames, that are original.
2. Fishing and Woodcutting, which i will explain what will be different about them if you join.
3. Maybe an original skill, something we make.

Much more will probably be added but these are just some examples.

[b]Positions Open[/b]

Here are the positions that are currently open

Server Developer 1 : OPEN
Server Developer 2 : OPEN
Client Developer 1 : OPEN
Client Developer 2 : OPEN
Website Developer 1 : OPEN
Tester 1 : OPEN
Tester 2 : OPEN

[b]Applications[/b]

There will be several forms of applications due to the wide variety of positions open.

I don&#39;t know if Availability is a word or not, but it means when are you available.

Server and Client developers have basically the same application, which is this 

I ask that you PM the question anserws, so that no one can cheat.

[code=java]
Name:
Age:
Experience with Java:
What you want to join:
How you can help:
Availability:
What is a boolean:
What is a string:
[/code]

If you want to apply for the position of Website Developer, here is the application you need to fill out


Since i know very little about HTML, or Javascript, I wont be hypacritical. In other words, i wont ask questions.

[code=java]
Name:
Age:
Experience with Website Developement:
How can you help:
Availability:[/code]

And finally, if you want to be one of the testers, here is the application.

[code=java]

That&#39;s about it.
