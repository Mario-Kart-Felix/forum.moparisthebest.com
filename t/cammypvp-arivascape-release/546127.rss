    <title>CammyPVP Arivascape Release</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cammypvp-arivascape-release/546127</link>
    <description>Hello! This was made a few years back, It didn&#39;t take long to do, so there are still some bugs, but all the weapon animations are correct, Graardor&#39;s attack, defence, death etc animations are correct. It is ready to play, but you may want to up the price of donator, or nerf it a bit, anyway here we go!

To start with there is a useful control panel

The bank, which is functional, it allows quick banking of items, both in the inventory and worn with the buttons at the bottom right of the interface

Questing- The hunt of the KBD

The activity shop- A player gains activity points whilst online.

The PKPoint shop Powerful weapons and armour can be purchased here, along with some rare potions, such as extreme strength and the overload potion, most of the items can also be obtained by fighting difficult bosses.

Boss Fights- Strong weapons and armour such as Chaotic weaponry, Vesta, Statius, Dragon claws, Primal 2h, H&#39;weens are dropped by bosses such as General Graardor, Rex, The Kalphite Queens, The Chaos elemental and other similar bosses, the bosses are well animated and are a challenge to kill, the flying kalphite requires verac&#39;s armour and flail to kill, whilst General Graardor can heal Hp, most of the bosses require prayer to fight, such as protection prayers or piety.

Spells such as Vengance are fully functional, have fun, if you are to host a server using this as a base, all I ask is that I get free donator status on it, and aside from that, do what you wish with it.

Also a slight bonus, for owners ::graardor turns you into general graardor with correct attack, spec attack, walk and block anims.
Sort of like a super ::pnpc

</aside>
<p>Wrong; I was the owner and coder of Edge4Pk. (Snoepie1012) along with Yoeri.<br>
Ariva had only involved in Arivascape which I later toke over.</p>
<p>Arivascape != Edge4Pk</p>
