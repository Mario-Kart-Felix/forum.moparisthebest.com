    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-wana-know-if-this-is-against-the-rules/184772</link>
    <description>before you start to cuse me out i just wana say.
i read the rules.
so dont go says &quot;aw screw you!
you nub faget!&quot;
cause i dont feel like reading it again.
is it against the rules to advertise for a client share?
for example:
i have a client.but i cant port forward.
i need someone to help me with my server anway.
i also need someone to port forward.
1.is this against the rules.
2.can someone else port forward for me?
before you answer these questions label them if the answer is about P.F
(port forwarding.)put in &#39;2.&#39;if its about the rules put &#39;1.&#39;
thanks for reading if you did...</description>
