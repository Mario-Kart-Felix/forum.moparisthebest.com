    <title>Paypal membership issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paypal-membership-issue/460333</link>
    <description>I was just wondering if anyone has had an issue with using Paypal to pay for membership lately.

At first I thought it was just the paypal I was using but another person that plays Rs has the same issue.

Basically I&#39;m not getting sent the bill so the money required for membership isn&#39;t coming out of the Paypal account however it still says I&#39;m subscribed etc.

Has anyone better yet found a solution for this xD?</description>

              <p>I’ve never had that particular issue, but I’ve had a lot of issues paying with paypal in general over the years. I just don’t use it.</p>
