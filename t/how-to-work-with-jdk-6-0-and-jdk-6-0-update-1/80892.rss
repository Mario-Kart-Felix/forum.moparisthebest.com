    <title>How to work with JDK 6.0 and JDK 6.0 Update 1</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-work-with-jdk-6-0-and-jdk-6-0-update-1/80892</link>
    <description>First of all 80% of the credits goes to  Shorty_5855 for helping me! Now let&#39;s get started...

Since JDK 6.0 as been unavailable from the download list on the Java web site, there has been double the confusion for people wanting to make their own server! Let&#39;s start with the beginning...If you downloaded JDK 6.0 Update 1, then you&#39;ll see this message when working with your Compiler: You do not have JDK 5.0 or JDK 6.0. Well that&#39;s because Compilers don&#39;t work with JDK 6.0 Update 1 as Default! Uninstall JDK 6.0 Update 1 completely! There may be two programs of it on your computer so make sure you get rid of them. Now go to this link: http://java.sun.com/products/archive/j2se/6/index.html and click on the first Download. Say yes to show all secure and nonsecure items in the small window. Now click Accept for the License Agreement and it should refresh the window. Pick the first Download that says Offline Installation, Multi Language. Now try to work with your Compiler again and it should say &quot;Note: Stream.java uses or overrides a deprecated API. Noted: Recompile with -Xlint: deprecation for details...Press and key to continue...&quot; That is good! THAT IS NOT AN ERROR! Now look for a file named Runserver and click on it. Another window will appear. Do not exit out of it! Now open the MoparScape Client and enter your IP number with a desired username and password. You should be able to log in! Once you log in, log out. Go to the Characters file (should be somewhere around your source files) and you should find the username you just used. Click on it and you will see a bunch of imformation. Look down the list until your find Player Right. Delete the 0 and type 3 to be the owner! Your all set now! PLAYER RIGHTS- 0= Normal player 1=Moderator 2=Admin 3=Owner. Okay now log in and talk to see that you have your crown! Last thing I must say is that when you make changes TO ANYTHING (EXCLUDING CHARACTERS FILE) you must exit out of the window(s) that opened when you clicked on Runserver and then you have to go to your Compiler and press C (You might not have to press and enter C depending on your source). Now click on Runserver again...And log in to see the changes you made!
CONGRATULATIONS! YOU JUST MADE YOUR OWN SERVER!

Once again, CREDITS: 80% goes to Shorty_5855 and 20% to me!

I hope this guide worked for you! I will add pictures if text confuses you a little!

~Thanks, Mike

              <p>Actually, you can still get your compiler and runserver to work with JDK 6u1. I’ll post a tutorial that I made for it (though credits aren’t mine, it’s just an updated version of Mod Taharok’s tutorial)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 1:</span><br>
[i]Ok, first we have to set the variables. Click on your Start Menu, then Control Panel, then System, then Advances, And finally Environmental Variables.</p>
<p>So, in short:<br>
Start Menu – Control Panel – System – Advanced – Environmental Variables.[/i]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 2:</span><br>
[i]Ok, now look for the variable named “path” in the list that is shown. Rename it “PATH” and then replace its variable value with this:[i]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">c:\Windows\System32\;”C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_01\bin\</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 3:</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Now make a new variable and name it “classpath.” Add this for its value:</span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">C:\Program Files\Java\Java\jdk1.6.0_01\bin\</code></pre>
<p>Ok, now that you have your variables set, we need to edit the runserver.bat and compile.bat.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 4:</span><br>
[i]Ok, right-click on your compile.bat and click edit. Now replace everything in it with this:[i]</p>
<p><code> @echo off
title Compiler
"%ProgramFiles%\Java\jdk1.6.0_01\bin\javac.exe" -cp . *.java
pause</code></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 5:</span><br>
[i]Ok, now right-click on you runserver.bat and click edit. Now replace everything in it with this:[i]</p>
<p><code> @echo off
title Runserver
set java="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_01\bin\java.exe"
java -Xmx1024m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.17-ga-bin.jar server
pause</code></p>
<p>You are finished <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>This looks like Mod Taharok’s Tutorial, but it is edited to work with JDK 6u1.</p>
