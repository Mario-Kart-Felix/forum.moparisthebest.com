    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-help-me-i-am-having-all-kinds-of-trouble/219578</link>
    <description>Well i downloaded a bunch of clients but i have no clue how to connect to them... it always says error logging in or somthing and i know the servers arent offline.. for example i downloaded Bluecore client. The client runs but i have no clue how to actually connect to the server. If somebody would either tell me how to solve this problem or gimme some info on hwo to connect to a good server they know of.. preferrably one with godwars items and such.</description>

              <p>If your having problems connecting to another server its because its offline. If you downloaded a client that doesn’t have server ip then it probably has one already set therefore you can’t log into any other server with that client. If you loaded the client then it should load on another server, you can go on my forums to download my client and go on my server.</p>
