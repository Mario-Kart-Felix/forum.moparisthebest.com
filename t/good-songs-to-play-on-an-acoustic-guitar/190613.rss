    <title>Good songs to play on an Acoustic guitar?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-songs-to-play-on-an-acoustic-guitar/190613</link>
    <description>Sup mitb, 3 days ago I bought an acoustic guitar to help me with some music coursework. The guitar is an ARIA, I don&#39;t know much about makes, I only bought it because it was nice to play in the store and it was around my price range.

Anyways I haven&#39;t been able to put it down, i&#39;ve fallen in love with strumming some chords and singing, makes me feel very tranquil. The question I put to you guys is what songs are good to play like that?

So far i&#39;ve been playing;

Birds - Kate Nash
Your guardian angel - The red jumpsuit
Tears in heaven - Eric Clapton
Drunken lullabies - Flogging molly
The velorium camper I: Faint of hearts - Coheed and cambria

So any other fun songs to play? I&#39;d like songs that are easy to just strum the chords and sing the melody, or even like &quot;Tears in heaven&quot; just have a really nice melody which is quite simple to play.

Thanks.</description>

Easy, and catchy.</p>

<p>Depends how good you are too.  Some good clasical pieces (non-lyrical) are always fun.</p>
