    <title>Private smp server: penturt’s funhouse</title>

    <description>Visit website @ Penturt&#39;s Funhouse [url=http://penguingaming.servegame.com/]http://penguingaming.servegame.com/[/url]
Penturt’s Funhouse was a private survival server I had put together for myself and some IRL friends to play Minecraft together, unfortunately due to real life issues only about 4 of us still play on the server., and I hate to see the server just sit there.

So I have decided to get some life back into the server and invite players to come play on my server, the server will still remain private so joining will be by invite only.
The server runs on a dedicated machine available 24/7, this machine’s only propose is to host this one Minecraft server, so in turn I have never had any lag issue.
As a precaution the server is set to backup nightly at 6am EST as well as restart right after the backup.
Currently I only have 15 slots available, which I can always expand if the server gets more visitors.
This server has been up since mid-May 2012, with the release of 1.3 we all decided to start a new world, so this world is fairly new.
The server is an EXTREME BIOMES world type.
I try to keep the feel of the game as close to vanilla Minecraft as possible, yet I do have a few plugins that enhance the gameplay. And I’m always looking into adding more plugins, so feel free to recommend any you think we could use, and it might be added!

If you are interested and would like to know more about my server visit our website below.
