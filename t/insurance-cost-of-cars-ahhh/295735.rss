    <title>Insurance, cost of cars ahhh</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/insurance-cost-of-cars-ahhh/295735</link>
    <description>Ok, well my moms friend was going to sell us a 2001 chevy cavalier (btw I live in America) for $1500 (which is our price range for a down payment type thing, but she wanted only $1500 for it) well turns out she can&#39;t sell it cus she can&#39;t find another car. Well, I was looking on ebay and there all shit cars for $1500.. I don&#39;t want to have to go to a buy here pay here thing because I have to pay for my insurance and I have to get full coverage. Well, This guy is going to sell me a &#39;97 mustang for $500 it needs a new battery, new tires and its perfect. Nothing wrong with tranny, engine etc.. (selling it because hes to old and doesn&#39;t want to drive it).. Well, my dad ruled it out because it would be to high for insurance.. so my question is.. how much do you think a &#39;97 mustang would be for a 16 y/o male.. compared to how much is full overage for a 4 cylinder car (mustang is 6 cylinder)</description>

<p>Ok, well my moms friend was going to sell us a 2001 chevy cavalier (btw I live in America) for $1500 (which is our price range for a down payment type thing, but she wanted only $1500 for it) well turns out she can’t sell it cus she can’t find another car. Well, I was looking on ebay and there all shit cars for $1500… I don’t want to have to go to a buy here pay here thing because I have to pay for my insurance and I have to get full coverage. Well, This guy is going to sell me a '97 mustang for $500 it needs a new battery, new tires and its perfect. Nothing wrong with tranny, engine etc… (selling it because hes to old and doesn’t want to drive it)… Well, my dad ruled it out because it would be to high for insurance… so my question is… how much do you think a '97 mustang would be for a 16 y/o male… compared to how much is full overage for a 4 cylinder car (mustang is 6 cylinder)</p>

</aside>
<p>I think it depends how long you’ve been driving. It does where I live. I pay $500 a month for insurance for my civic.</p>

              <p>If you buy a 97 Mustang with a 6-cylinder for $500 you don’t need and it would be stupid to get full coverage.  Just get the state minimum insurance and it shouldn’t be that much, they take into account engine size and it isn’t a fast one so the insurance shouldn’t be that much if you stay on your parent’s plan.  Certainly much less than full coverage on a new car, not to mention the amount of payments.</p>

In the US you only need compulsory insurance.  Fire &amp; theft is optional.</p>
