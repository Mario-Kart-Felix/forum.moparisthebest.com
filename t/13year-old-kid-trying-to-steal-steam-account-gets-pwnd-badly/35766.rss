Greg_ValveOLS says: 
oh k 

br0kenrabbit says: 
As an employee, I know that Valve employees will NEVER contact users over MSN. I also know a valve employee will NEVER ask a user for his/her username and password. 

br0kenrabbit says: 
I&#39;m putting a temporary hold on your Steam account. 

Greg_ValveOLS says: 
why? 

br0kenrabbit says: 
Have you read the ToS? 

Greg_ValveOLS says: 
Tod? 

Greg_ValveOLS says:

br0kenrabbit says: 
terms of service 

Greg_ValveOLS says: 
were? 

br0kenrabbit says: 
Greg, this is a serious infraction against the Tos. You are at risk of losing your account. 

Greg_ValveOLS says: 
why 

br0kenrabbit says:

Greg_ValveOLS says: 
  

br0kenrabbit says: 
I need some information from you if you want me to unlock you account. I&#39;m going to write you up but I will only suspend you account for three days, since this is your first infraction, okay? 

Greg_ValveOLS says: 
k 

br0kenrabbit says: 
First, what is the name the account is registered to. Not the user name, the persons real name who created the account. This is for verification purposes. 

Greg_ValveOLS says: 
xxxxx xxxxxxx

<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
Well…</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
if you can verify your account information to me i can insure that only your ip have access to it Its a new security feature were trying because this happens so muchlogin names and passwords aint safe anymroe You know. L</p>

<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
Can I be honest with you, Greg?</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
k</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
Look, I don’t know how you go this MSN account name, don’t really care, either.</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
Unlike you, I DO work for Valve. Trace my ip and you’ll see.</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
huh?</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
bs</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
Trace it.</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>

<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
Start/run/cmd type Tracert and then my IP address and hit enter.</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
oh k</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
As an employee, I know that Valve employees will NEVER contact users over MSN. I also know a valve employee will NEVER ask a user for his/her username and password.</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
I’m putting a temporary hold on your Steam account.</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
why?</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
Have you read the ToS?</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
Tod?</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
tos</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
terms of service</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
were?</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
Greg, this is a serious infraction against the Tos. You are at risk of losing your account.</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
why</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
I just told you why</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
I need some information from you if you want me to unlock you account. I’m going to write you up but I will only suspend you account for three days, since this is your first infraction, okay?</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
k</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
First, what is the name the account is registered to. Not the user name, the persons real name who created the account. This is for verification purposes.</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
xxxxx xxxxxxx</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
Is this you?</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
ya</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
Are you the only user of this account?</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
ya</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
Okay, and what is the username</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
