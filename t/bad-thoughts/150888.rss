    <description>Lately, I have been very sad and I&#39;m not &quot;Emo&quot;...

What I think about is what it will be like when my parents die, or I die.. If you really think about it, it is so horrifyingly scary for me considering that you will rot in the ground and there is no heaven or hell.  Like, I think, &quot;Wow, what will I miss?&quot;.. I do not even think I can handle the thoughts and when I realize that it will just be over.. I&#39;m sad.. 

I&#39;m not &quot;Emo&quot; or anything.. Just scared of what it will be like.</description>

<p>You can think of the fear as death as a manifestation of the will to survive, the need to fight onwards and the driving force behind a human being to improve himself and the world around him. In that way, the fear of death is useful - it’s our mind telling us to do all we can to stop that from happening to us.</p>

<p>There are always exceptions.</p>
<p>I’ve been kind of sad before, but I really don’t care because I always think “I’ll forget about this in a week”. I have very good empathy skills so I can make good predictions of whats going to happen for example if I have done something or if something has happened to somebody else I would put myself in the other persons shoes and think what they would want me to do then just do it. I do it so randomly and if say someone dies I match them up to someone close to me then think “oh so that’s how their friends and family must feel.”</p>
<p>If your scared of death your kind of pathetic. Why be scared of the inevitable? Fear is only good if there is a way to get out of the situation.</p>

              <p>My thoughts are that you are probably quite young (maybe 13?).<br>
Anyways its common in teenagers to have moodswings which makes you basically feel moody in any such way (some times feel pissed off, sometimes you want to die, sometimes you want to fuck a piece of bread because your so horny). Anyways the way i delt with it was to just remind myself that i wasnt really angry at anything or sad about anything and it was just the hormones…</p>
<p>Many ways to cheer yourself up.</p>
