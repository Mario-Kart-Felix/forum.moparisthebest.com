    <title>Quest Problem 508</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quest-problem-508/350421</link>
    <description>Ok,I had the dragon slayer&#39;s quest on my source..So i figured out how to make to where it automaticly gives me the quest points and finish the quest..But when i try to wear dragon plate..It says i need to finish the quest Dragon slayers.
So i went into my charcter file Xseil.But then it said i already finished dragon slayer and i have 3 quest points..But i still can&#39;t wear a dragon platebody..If you need further information just ask :)

P.S:Could i delete the quest?If so.... how would i do that??</description>
