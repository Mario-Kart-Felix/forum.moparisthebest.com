    <description>Not sure where this would go either Client or Server, I think it is client,

But is there any chance for me to edit the maps of the actual runescape 317 server?

I would like to change the Character model as well, The only reason why I&#39;m doing this is that it could help make a game without having to code up all the bullshit, I would love to learn to make a game from scratch but sadly don&#39;t got the time probabl in like 8 weeks I could start working on something from scratch.

The Idea is to change the Whole Runescape thing from Medieval to a Fantasy game.</description>
