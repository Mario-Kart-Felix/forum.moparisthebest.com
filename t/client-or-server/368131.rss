    <title>Client or server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-or-server/368131</link>
    <description>I started playing a server and recently a new client was added which has a uid. but when i logged onto play my account was level 3 and it appeared as though i had been reset. but when i actually looked there was an Èinfront of my name. The È is not in the client when i go to log in so does anybody have any idea what i can do? perhaps something to do with the new uid.</description>
