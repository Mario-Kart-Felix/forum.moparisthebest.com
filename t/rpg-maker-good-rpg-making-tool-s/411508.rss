    <description>(NOTE: Im not sure if im alloud to post this but since its new i will anyways.  i dont see any rules saying otherwise.) if so i can remove the text and lock)

I also am not telling anyone to buy it unless you want to this is not made by my( i couldnt make this type of stuff in my dreams)  

Its just something to help new people get used to making games untill they learn enough to develope there own kind of stuff.

Alright so this game development is pretty new to moparscape so i just thought i would give you all a rpg making tool.

can be found here- http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/

It is ment to be bought but you can download a keygen to get the whole thing for free.

How to get it
1. Download the trial version.
2. Run and install
3. Enjoy the trial or.. if you want to have it for free and you dont mind using a keygen then search it up on youtube.  Let me know if you want a link to a keygen tut on how to get for free.


This software is a really easy to use once you know how to and understand the basic controles.



In RPG Maker XP users had to use the RGSS script to make their games. But now you can make great games without any coding knowledge. Save time by making frequently occurring events (like chests, doors, etc.) with a single command. Create beautiful maps quickly and easily with our new software.

Use a huge catalogue of pre-rendered graphics and sounds!
For users who don&#39;t want to spend time creating their own graphics or sounds, RPG Maker VX comes with a wide array of both. Now you can get started on that brilliant storyline right away without having to agonize over making your own great looking graphics.

Share your games online!
Like its predecessors, RPG Maker VX allows you to save your completed game and share it with others. Now you can burn your game onto a disc or upload it online and share it with everyone
