    <description>Okay so at first I started a server and coded it but i&#39;ll admit it was crappy. There wasn&#39;t any lag but the effects and animations were cruddy. A lot of the attack styles for the monsters were glitchy and it didn&#39;t have all of the weapons pre installed on the client. 
So what I am trying to ask is if anyone has a client or knows a client that has all of the weapons (claws, Godswords, Vesta, ect) all NPC&#39;s that have working animation and all the spec attacks work. btw it has to be a 317 and only the client please :) Post here if you have anything
Make it a delta please</description>
