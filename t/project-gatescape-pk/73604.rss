    <description>[center][b][u]GateScape PK[/b][/center]

[center]Hi, I had one of these threads in the past, but no one ever responded. O M G&#39;s topic 
reminded me that I still need a crew, so credits to him.[/center]

[center][u][b]The Plan[/b][/u][/center]

[center]My plan is to hire a sort of &quot;crew&quot;/developing team. I have a lot of the coding done, mostly 
by Blitz, my former coder/co-owner. I fixed many errors and so did my other friend, Justin. 
The source is great, imo. It&#39;s a very well done edited P16 server, and I just can&#39;t fix everything by myself.
.
I plan to make this server as error free as possible, and to do that I need some help. When I 
get more experienced, I&#39;m going to TRY (note the TRY) and make it so that it has a custom area, like outside of RuneScape areas, if that makes sense.[/center]

[center][u][b]The Team[/b][/u][/center]

(obviously).[/i][/center]

[center][u][b]So Far...[/b][/u][/center]

So far the server is good, but could use a lot of work.

Here are some of the things it already has:

Construction
Working Staking
Anti- ::noclip
Working Melee and Mage
A lot more, a sort of basic server, could use a lot of work as I stated.

Things I need to address:

Pking, there&#39;s only wildy right now, it works like real RS.
Ranging, is way too powerful and it&#39;s messed.
Exp rate, too slow.
There&#39;s a way to dupe, but I already fixed it.
Glitches.
...and a LOT more.

[center][u][b]Things added today (4/2/07):[/b][/u]

[center]Right Click Ban
Anti ::noclip[/center]

[i]Thanks for reading! I&#39;ll be adding more. :P[/i]</description>
