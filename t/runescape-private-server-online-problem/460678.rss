    <title>Runescape Private Server Online Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-private-server-online-problem/460678</link>
    <description>Hello there. I am a owner of a runescape private server called Runecient and the problem is that I am trying to connect online and it says that the server has been updated and but I talk to my friend (There&#39;s only 2 owners of this server.) and he never made a update of anything and there may have 1 file that is missing.

I have tried to run a run.bat but it has never worked. Please help me. :/ 

By the way, if you&#39;re interest in joining my server, please do so. It&#39;s a 317 server. :)
