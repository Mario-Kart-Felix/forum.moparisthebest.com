              <p>Ok now i have written at least a page about lag before i call it “Lag Education”.</p>
<p>Lag can be caused by much much more then just server files. Now some people may log onto your server and say there is no lag at all while others may log on or at least attempt to log on but be dropped because of lag (lagging out). Now in the case of someone lagging out it’s not always server side issues but rather isp issues such as bad connection, for example if someone logs on who is downloading things from limewire, playing music, using msn,running scanns, or using an interface that takes memory or proccess up then it will be them that is the root cause of the lag. Sadly this is not the case all the time but this can be proved by looking at the new XBOX360 game Rainbow6 vegas. When you are in the lobby and someone has a red dot indicating bad connection it means that players connection will slow everyone down causing lagg. Now If you are planning to run a dedicated server try running as few programms as possible. Now in terms of In server lag the cause can be Talking NPC’s which will cause lag. Now Minimize the amount of npc speach if possible and try keeping player numbers down to a set number. Anyway this is just a small amount of information on lagg. Ill write a post on it later with FULL detail. hope this helps.</p>

<p>Or mabye its just your computer, close some windows that are not really need open for the moment or just restart your computer, lag might be gone after that.</p>
<p>Also, it starts to lag on my server when ppl mass on the doors, or mass teleport, just make sure ppl are massing on either of those.</p>
