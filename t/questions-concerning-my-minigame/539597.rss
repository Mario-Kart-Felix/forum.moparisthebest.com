    <title>Questions concerning my minigame</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/questions-concerning-my-minigame/539597</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m kind of ripping the name &#39;Rise of the Six&#39; from Jagex, but I&#39;m making a new barrows minigame where the Strange-Old Man teleports you to the barrows arena(Basically the barrows hills on height 12 :p) and then they would then begin spawning after a couple of seconds, and continue respawning. 
my questions are as follows: 
1.  How would I setup the npc&#39;s spawning (Several of each brother) or one spawns, and shortly after another spawns until a limit is hit?

2.  How would I set up a type of lobby with a 10-15 second waiting period before the spawn?

3. Last but not least, how would I make it so [I]only[/I] the brothers being spawned in this region can drop barrows items? where as the ones in their graves do not.

4. How would I make it so each brother spawns on their corresponding hill?

Help would be appreciated! If you could help me make this ( Not spoonfeeding) just giving me tips, and explaining some of the things for me.  That would be great, just let me know.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>1: loops.<br>
2: depending on whether or not your server has an event manager or some time-cycling system, you can use this, or define your own loop with the currentTimeMillis()<br>
3: remove all drop data from the npcs where the data is stored in the local files, and hard-code it. check the npc death and only spawn ground items if the npc + player height is 12.<br>
4: when spawning, just define the coordinates you want each npc to spawn at. most npc spawning methods require arguments for the coordinates to be passed to it.</p>
