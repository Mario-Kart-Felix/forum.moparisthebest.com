    <description>Okay, I&#39;m writing this because IDK what to do.

It&#39;s about skipping classes at school. AKA; Jigging, wag, etc.

Okay, so last year I jigged a lot of days, around 109 to be specific.

Throughout that year I had gotten around 8-10 Letters for jigging.

So the other day me and 3 mates got pulled by 2 police, and they took our names, ID&#39;s, etc. They then said &quot;Go back to school now, we will be checking if you are there.&quot;

So, I know it&#39;s stupid but we didn&#39;t go back (this was on a monday)

Next day of school I went to first period, just to check if a teacher would come to my class about yesterdays &quot;incident&quot;.
Anyways, 4 days later on a friday, they got me out of my class took me to office, there I saw the other 2 who jigged with me.

I mean seriously, 4 days later they call back...

Anyways, they said this was our last chance, and made us sign some Home School shit...
So, I went whole day of school on Monday &amp; Tuesday I went 4 out of the 5 periods.

Now, IDK how the fuck I got caught today but when I got home today around 2 o&#39;clock, phone rang and I answered it (this is about 5-10minutes ago)

and it was my Principal, she asked for my mum. My mum wasn&#39;t home,

But she said she will call back.

Now, my mum arrived home bout 2 minutes ago and she asked me why I&#39;m home so early, and I just said &quot;it&#39;s tuesday&quot;...

Now, wtf should I do? there gonna call back and this is my last chance or Home Schooling + My mum is home :(

I&#39;m in year 9. Please, advice.</description>

If you don’t, you’re probably going to end up a slob living off of benefits for most of your life. Getting a job these days is hard and probably will be for a while. Go get some qualifications.</p>
<p>Also, why are you skipping school? I’ve had my fair bit off of school over the years (Around 85-90% attendance each year) and I regret it now.<br>
It’s going to bite you on the ass when you have to do your exams.</p>

<p>Homeschooling can actually get more pricey than that depending on where you buy the books or go through. My cuz is home-schooled and his mom pays about $1500 per child, for my cuz and his sister, for the books and such. Although, i was home-schooled for about 6 months for the low price of $200. It just depends on where you look to get the stuff from.</p>

              <p>[quote=“justinxg27, post:1, topic:333012”]Okay, I’m writing this because IDK what to do.</p>
<p>It’s about skipping classes at school. AKA; Jigging, wag, etc.</p>
<p>Okay, so last year I jigged a lot of days, around 109 to be specific.</p>
<p>Throughout that year I had gotten around 8-10 Letters for jigging.</p>
<p>So the other day me and 3 mates got pulled by 2 police, and they took our names, ID’s, etc. They then said “Go back to school now, we will be checking if you are there.”</p>
<p>So, I know it’s stupid but we didn’t go back (this was on a monday)</p>
<p>Next day of school I went to first period, just to check if a teacher would come to my class about yesterdays “incident”.<br>
Anyways, 4 days later on a friday, they got me out of my class took me to office, there I saw the other 2 who jigged with me.</p>
<p>I mean seriously, 4 days later they call back…</p>
<p>Anyways, they said this was our last chance, and made us sign some Home School shit…<br>
So, I went whole day of school on Monday &amp; Tuesday I went 4 out of the 5 periods.</p>
<p>Now, IDK how the fuck I got caught today but when I got home today around 2 o’clock, phone rang and I answered it (this is about 5-10minutes ago)</p>
<p>and it was my Principal, she asked for my mum. My mum wasn’t home,</p>
<p>But she said she will call back.</p>
<p>Now, my mum arrived home bout 2 minutes ago and she asked me why I’m home so early, and I just said “it’s tuesday”…</p>
<p>Now, wtf should I do? there gonna call back and this is my last chance or Home Schooling + My mum is home <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I’m in year 9. Please, advice.[/quote]</p>
