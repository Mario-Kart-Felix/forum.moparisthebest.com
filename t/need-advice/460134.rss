    <title>Need Advice</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-advice/460134</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been working with this template for a awhile now &#39;Cannot remember where i got it from&#39;, on and off mostly; and i got to the point where i need some advice.

There are a few things that are noticeably wrong, such as the NavBar and the fact that the arrows for the slider are at the top of the page when it&#39;s loading (Haven&#39;t figured out why, nor have i really looked into it).

Any advice would be great, don&#39;t just pop in and say it is complete shit. If it is in your opinion then at least give me some pointers of what needs to be changed.

Below is images of the site, not sure what the rules on posting links are; so for now images will do.

the only thing i find wrong is the logo ;p<br>

<p>I agree, i may just pay someone to make one for me; i used a crappy logo maker for a place holder.</p>
<p>I agree, the site may look fine. I posted this to see if anyone else could find noticeable flaws that i may of overlooked.</p>
<p>On to the slider, it’s not something i can easily explain. But if you load this page (<a href="http://www.deviconcreations.com">www.deviconcreations.com</a>) the slider arrows seem to start at the top of the page, and move their way down when the page finishes loading. I haven’t been able to pinpoint the problem, but it is a extreme annoyance.[/quote]<br>
I believe it’s due to the related jquery being run from a $(document).ready function, which delays running the related code until the page is loaded.<br>
You’d have to manually position the arrows in the right place in the css.</p>
