    <title>Get the commuity focused</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/get-the-commuity-focused/518437</link>
    <description>Don&#39;t know how. Perhaps move on to different topics: botting, general programming, etc. A community project is pretty much out of the question as it will not work. From the looks of it, moparscape will join the likes of moparisthebest and be dead within a year.

Anyone have any specific suggestions?</description>

<p>Honestly, this is one major problem with this website. We need to introduce some type of draw to get more members to help. Years ago when I joined the website I felt helping was like a mini-competion. People used to rush to help others (I guess reputation was a draw), and you’d be lucky to be the first post on a topic. We just need people to be interested in helping others.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For the simple reason of getting the community focused. If it can be thought of, then it can be planned. With a plan comes opportunity, and with opportunity comes those who are willing to take the chance.<br>
From what I’ve seen, the reason there has never been a successful community project was because it was never managed - at least not efficiently. Should there be an actual place for this to be discussed, should all members being the main contributors have access to more important things, and most importantly if there was a thread where all of this would be managed - not by one person, but the members - then this could take off.<br>
Sure, you would need to provide a sort of motivation, and although I am very much against the idea of monetary reward, if that is what it takes, then so be it. If even one of these community projects could at least get to the point where work is significantly noticeable, then I’m sure it could be done time and time again.</p>

Although this is true, the idea of a community contribution does not have to be a bot client. Options can be:</p>
<p>[ul][li]A community private server[/li]<br>
[li]A community-contributed homepage for MoparScape[/li]<br>
[li]A website[/li]<br>
[li]A game engine[/li][/ul]</p>

If this idea was to be used, I again bring up the idea of an application process, similar to that of a development team. Perhaps have vouches and proof of work as mandatory application segments?</p>

<p>We’ve dwindled away from the point of this discussion. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
In an environment such as MoparScape, where you find users much more knowledgable than you in certain areas, there is always that pressure that someone will outsmart you in what you are talking about, which tends to leave areas such as General Programming and the debates sections to more of the experienced and knowledgeable members. Still, there is no ‘Beginner’s Forbidden’ sign restricting entry to this forum anymore, which is why more members should take advantage of that and dwell into these boards in order to learn.</p>

<p>First, I want to say that I ran out of breath from reading that statement.<br>
Rather than complaining that ‘the site sucks,’ provide visual and physical ideas on how to improve. Saying that the design of this forum is horrid leaves us with nothing to work off of except that you find it ugly. I’m not sure what you’re used to, but simplicity is key to mature members within a forum. I don’t want to feel like I’m standing on a rainbow when I visit a website, much less a website where I engage in serious discussion with other members.</p>
<blockquote>the new home page sucks</blockquote>
Way to jump on the bandwagon, won't you now. Provide something to work off of otherwise stop complaining.

<p>Not true. People tend to stick to the areas of the forum that they originally joined for. For example, a person who had very little patience with programming and made multiple topics in a help section without even taking the time to show prior knowledge on the matter will not be treated the same as someone who had made themselves known in general discussion by making intelligent responses.

For example, a person who had very little patience with programming and made multiple topics in a help section without even taking the time to show prior knowledge on the matter will not be treated the same as someone who had made themselves known in general discussion by making intelligent responses. Plus, the majority of new members joining are in the age range of 13-16, which leaves them attempting to sound ‘cool’ on an online forum. tl;dr, people who act immaturely will not be regarded with as much respect as those who act maturely.[/quote]<br>
There are tons of people on here who could be considered as “immature” and fit into a higher “social” class. Take a new member for example; they may not know a lot about programming or private servers, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t mature.</p>

<p>Let’s face it: the whole RSPS business is declining.</p>

<p>It’s not dying. Rather, the people who actually took the time to study Java and similar in order to run a private server, are nonexistent nowadays. Therefore less people are willing to learn how to program, which leads to less private servers, which ultimately leaves the world of R.S.P.S. dug into the ground.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s a valid point but I still think it’s dying. Over the years the scene has been slightly descreasing to the point where now communities are starting to shift onto other subjects because the lack of development, activity, etc. RL is doing it, and I don’t think R-S has gotten to that point yet but I think it’s only a matter of time. Look at the stats here provided by SMF yourself, you can see decline for sure.</p>
<p>I also think with oldschool RS out, there is a lesser population playing private servers. I don’t have evidence to backup that claim but with oldschool RS out what’s the point of private servers? They have the same, if not less, value than before now because EOC was their only alternative.<br>
[/quote]I don’t think of it so much as ‘dying’ but rather the interest for RSPS surged at a point, and its simply declining from its peak. Sure, it could definitely be dying, but unless we see a linear or exponential decline, I don’t think we can declare the nail in the coffin quite yet.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t declare it dead yet.[/quote]I meant it rather that we can’t declare the RSPS scene is definitely dying. We may see another surge, or it may steadily decline. Who knows.</p>

              <p>Again, less people are willing to learn the ropes. I agree that we need to expand towards other topics, as I previously said.<br>
I don’t believe that the private server community is dying out as much as I believe that less people are willing to take the time and understand the basic mechanics of a server. All we see nowadays are Project Insanity servers handed through tons of garbage code, and no one private server is reliable enough anymore for it to stay online for more than a few weeks. Because of that, people are moving onto different things, and when offered a unique server with lots of time put into it, they (by they, I imply the average 13-16 year old looking for a small server to become a mod on) just run back to a duplicate of the server that just closed.</p>
<p>To your last statement, as long as there is someone with a bit of money and an imagination, there will always be private servers, regardless of how popular they are. And eventually people will get bored of the 2007 servers and return to the realm of private servers.</p>
