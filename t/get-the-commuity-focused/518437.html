<p>Yes we need to expand into other fields, which should gain us more members in the process. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

That’s obviously difficult though, considering the larger part of our userbase are here for that. The group outside of the RS2 Server Development category isn’t even half of the users who use this site. The Server Help board is still incredibly active and that won’t be changing anytime soon or not as far as I can see. If we change the site ideals then we’re going to lose a  large portion of what we’re currently slowly but surely losing.</p>

        <p>My opinion is completely biased, and I will most likely receive bad feedback from stating it, but I really think the problem is the forum software itself and the current community. I love SMF and I’ve grown quite attached to this theme, but having more features, whether it be with this forum software or another, is something that would most certainly attract newer members while hopefully keeping the current ones.</p>
<p>As I stated above, another problem is the community. There is way too much drama, and that’s because everyone knows each other, except maybe the select few that are newly registered. The hatred towards other in this community is rather vague, but still very much noticeable. I don’t mean to bring notice to pure hatred, but rather judgmental slander and things of the nature. Of course, I’m sure there are people that completely despise someone else, but that is only human nature; however, this hatred can be stopped by just ignoring or attempting to adapt to the current social situation you are in.</p>
<p>I’ve been a part of this community for nearly 3 years, and even though this is a website which features only virtual communication, there have been several times I’ve been scared to death just to comment on something, for the fact that people are extremely judgmental. There are many things that could be done to fix this social corruption, and a great start would be to enforce the rules and be more strict, and even monitor new users to ensure that they aren’t breaking the rules either.</p>
<p>Edit: It seems that there are classes of society on this site, so that some users are more important or less valued than others, which is absurd. Starting a community project is bad, because there are a lot of people who don’t fit in certain groups, but there should seriously be alternatives to motivating people to participate in the community, whether it be private server competitions, game competitions, or even general programming competitions.</p>

<p>As for a suggestion, it’s very tough to think of something that would bring the community together and focus on something. Just look at the homepage announcement post, obviously none of us can agree on anything and we derail topics so far we just go to insulting eachother. The only thing I can think of, and I know it’s been suggested MANY times before is a group effort into a private server. People could could be assigned to different parts of the project and have mini development teams - one for interfaces, one for custom/redesigned models and environments, one for quests, etc. When something this big comes together, everyone feels a sense of accomplishment and unity. I think if we organize it well enough, it could turn out really well.</p>

<p>Put some thought into your help questions and someone might just help you.</p>
<p>To the thread: I’m relatively new to this community, and that will bias my opinion. I figured I’d voice my opinion anyways. I feel like rules need to be more strictly enforced and followed, and we need more sectional moderators to cover the areas that globals tend to stay away from. For example, the server advertisements sectional rules have been changed to allow explanation of donations within servers due to the plethora of advertisements now doing so, yet in the past this was not tolerated.<br>
In terms of the community, those ‘veterans’ and ‘well-known members’ are getting older moving on, and the focus of this site is R.S.P.S. (hence the name MoparScape). I agree that we should bring more emphasis on external aspects such as news, ideas, or at least open up some new boards and give them a chance.</p>

Not true. People tend to stick to the areas of the forum that they originally joined for. For example, a person who had very little patience with programming and made multiple topics in a help section without even taking the time to show prior knowledge on the matter will not be treated the same as someone who had made themselves known in general discussion by making intelligent responses. Plus, the majority of new members joining are in the age range of 13-16, which leaves them attempting to sound 'cool' on an online forum. tl;dr, people who act immaturely will not be regarded with as much respect as those who act maturely.

<p>That’s a valid point but I still think it’s dying. Over the years the scene has been slightly descreasing to the point where now communities are starting to shift onto other subjects because the lack of development, activity, etc. RL is doing it, and I don’t think R-S has gotten to that point yet but I think it’s only a matter of time. Look at the stats here provided by SMF yourself, you can see decline for sure.</p>
<p>I also think with oldschool RS out, there is a lesser population playing private servers. I don’t have evidence to backup that claim but with oldschool RS out what’s the point of private servers? They have the same, if not less, value than before now because EOC was their only alternative.</p>

        <p>Again, less people are willing to learn the ropes. I agree that we need to expand towards other topics, as I previously said.<br>
I don’t believe that the private server community is dying out as much as I believe that less people are willing to take the time and understand the basic mechanics of a server. All we see nowadays are Project Insanity servers handed through tons of garbage code, and no one private server is reliable enough anymore for it to stay online for more than a few weeks. Because of that, people are moving onto different things, and when offered a unique server with lots of time put into it, they (by they, I imply the average 13-16 year old looking for a small server to become a mod on) just run back to a duplicate of the server that just closed.</p>
<p>To your last statement, as long as there is someone with a bit of money and an imagination, there will always be private servers, regardless of how popular they are. And eventually people will get bored of the 2007 servers and return to the realm of private servers.</p>
