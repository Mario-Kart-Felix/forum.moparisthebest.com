              <p>This makes me sad. Jagex have f’ed up a lot lately but you can tell they are trying. The review does sound like it’s true because it would make sense from my understanding what the flaws are in the game.</p>
<p>The game defonetly needs a lead designer or w.e. it’s called who understands the vibe Rs had up until late 2012. It did loose some of its vibe in 2010- early 2012 but it was still good.</p>

              <blockquote>Unpaid overtime is expected, this is apparently industry standard but not exactly nice.Recently (last few weeks) shifted to mandatory overtime for several teams. This makes the unpaid aspect to the overtime downright unpleasant.</blockquote>
<p>I highly doubt they aren’t paid for overtime nor would I believe something like that without valid proof to be totally honest. I do live in America though so maybe the UK laws on that is different?</p>
<blockquote>Limited promotion prospects; management and exec roles are mostly external hires.</blockquote>
<p>Reality…100% of all higher level jobs are going to be like that. I will give you an example. You may be able to reach a production supervisor/manager position, but the plant manager will 99% of the time be an external hire.</p>
<blockquote>History of unsuccessful attempts to branch out from the core game, each repeating some trends that could have been addressed, e.g. shifting direction frequently on key mechanics and ignoring early warning signs, such as testers and developers on the project admitting "This game isn't fun" and multiple changes in creative leads for the same product.</blockquote>
<p>Again, common in any industry. Policies try to change, different procedures are created. Are they followed to the dot? There is just a gap in paperwork and efficiency when an audit occurs when there is any type of change.</p>
<blockquote>Communication between teams is often lacking, resulting in unnecessary, premature or wasted work.
Middle Management get panicky near milestones, resulting in sudden micromanagement and slightly raised tempers, but often appear disinterested (late for meetings discussing the project, slow to respond to questions) in the intervening periods.</blockquote>
<p>Again, very common. Very few companies have good “communication”. To be fair though, I can see where communication would be a key factor in a gaming industry.</p>
<blockquote>No granularity on importance of decisions, every request is "critical" and "top priority" which has to be done "ASAP". Decisions may be later overruled subject to another manager or executive's whim.</blockquote>
<p>This one made me laugh. I want to see proof of this one as well. Every item put on the table as a suggestion for any type of business will have a priority level. For example, do you buy new machinery for the factory works, or get that expensive ice machine dispenser that the employees have been desperately been wanting? It all comes down to money.</p>

<p>The worse thing Andrew did was bring that new lead of runescape in who had no idea what runescape was.

<p>I looked at this about a year ago and it was <span class="bbcode-i">extremely</span> different. All of the salaries were 3-4x what they are now and the ratings were much, much higher. Seems as though they’re in a landslide.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t think their salaries have ever been that high, to be honest. I’ve looked at their job postings over the years (I wanted to work there when I was in early high school - ha) and they’re more or less the same.<br>
If Britain’s cost of living is the same as, or higher than, Australia’s then their jobs would barely cover living expense. Indeed, one review mentions Jagex employees working a second job.</p>

<p>Last year I saw several salaries on the list ranging from $100-200K. The highest now is about $50K.<br>
[/quote]<br>
They wouldn’t have been your rank and file employee positions. Maybe management positions.[/quote]<br>
Point being the salaries have dropped, I don’t want to work at Jagex, doesn’t matter where I’d be personally<br>
Programmer gets paid E24K-48K, in the US at any decent workplace you’d make 2-3x that (if you’re experienced).</p>
