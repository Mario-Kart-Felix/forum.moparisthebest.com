    <description>Hey, I was unsure where to put this, so I put it here. Please say so if it is the wrong section. 

I was just curious as to whether it was possible to change a .zip file or a .GZ (Gzip file) back into a .dat file? 

If I need a program, what is the name of it.

And, yes, this does have to do with models but I thought that it wouldn&#39;t seem to be right in the models section. So, just say so if it should be moved/removed.
