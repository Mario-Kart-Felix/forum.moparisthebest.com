              <p>Go into the server folder edit client.java it could also be in gui.java for a client, press ctrl + h.in the first box type no-ip (which is the most common one)  it might not always be no-ip it could either be localhost, 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 or another no-ip domain.<br>
and client enter<br>
you will get a no-ip address, e.g “servername.no-ip.biz”<br>
change that to your no-ip that your created in no-ip<br>
after you have done that click save. go to compile.bat in your server then run.bat (it should start)<br>
you can then start up your client,</p>
<p>if you dont get what i mean you could always talk to me on msn and i will be more than welcome to help you out,<br>

<p>just to let you know after about a 2 month of you reaserching through the server and client you will soon know what to do. thats what i did. just guess then you will soon get the hang of it.</p>
