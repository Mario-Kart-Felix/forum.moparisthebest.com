    <description>OK, well, here it is:
If you have been banned because of offensive language, in the ban appeal write this:
Dear, Jagex

I&#39;m sorry for what i&#39;ve done. I know it was wrong and feel terrible towards the user i abused. If you decide to just give me a warning on this i would be grateful and can assure you nothing like this will occurr again. I feel it&#39;s my duty to apologize to the user i abused as i may have hurt their feelings, and made them upset. I know i wouldn&#39;t like to be spoken to in the way i did.

If you have been banned for Item Scamming write this:
Dear, Jagex

I&#39;m terribly sorry for trying to do this, i know it was wrong but it got the better of my everyone was doing it, so i thought i would give it ago. I&#39;ve totally learnt my lesson and won&#39;t even think of trying this again. Please keep in mind that i only tried to scam, i didn&#39;t actually scam anyone but i know that doesn&#39;t justify anything and i was in the wrong.

Thank You.

I will get some more in the furure...:D

Freshly Added:

I got some more guys :P. Here they are:

If you have been banned for Password Scamming put this in your appeal:

Jagex i didn&#39;t do anything wrong. Someone has been logging onto my account everyday for the last month or so. But they can&#39;t guess my bank pin. Every time i log in my bank pin has tryed to be deleted. I keep changing my password but they keep guessing it. I&#39;ve scanned my computer and it has no viruses please help. And please don&#39;t add to the situation by banning me =(

Thank You.

If you have been banned for Bug Abuse type this in your ban appeal:

Dear, Jagex

I&#39;m sorry for doing this but i think it was a mis-understanding, i come across that bug accidently. and i was so excited of what i did i tried to do it again, but it didn&#39;t work. I was trying to figure out how i did it exactly but i couldn&#39;t re-do it. so i am sorry for doing it although it was an accident and i couldn&#39;t repeat it, and i gained nothing out of it.

Thank You.

Thats all i got for now :D More will come later ;D :P</description>

              <p>OK, well, here it is:<br>
If you have been banned because of offensive language, in the ban appeal write this:<br>
Dear, Jagex</p>
<p>I’m sorry for what i’ve done. I know it was wrong and feel terrible towards the user i abused. If you decide to just give me a warning on this i would be grateful and can assure you nothing like this will occurr again. I feel it’s my duty to apologize to the user i abused as i may have hurt their feelings, and made them upset. I know i wouldn’t like to be spoken to in the way i did.</p>
<p>If you have been banned for Item Scamming write this:<br>
Dear, Jagex</p>
<p>I’m terribly sorry for trying to do this, i know it was wrong but it got the better of my everyone was doing it, so i thought i would give it ago. I’ve totally learnt my lesson and won’t even think of trying this again. Please keep in mind that i only tried to scam, i didn’t actually scam anyone but i know that doesn’t justify anything and i was in the wrong.</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>
<p>I will get some more in the furure…<img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Freshly Added:</p>
<p>I got some more guys :P. Here they are:</p>
<p>If you have been banned for Password Scamming put this in your appeal:</p>
<p>Jagex i didn’t do anything wrong. Someone has been logging onto my account everyday for the last month or so. But they can’t guess my bank pin. Every time i log in my bank pin has tryed to be deleted. I keep changing my password but they keep guessing it. I’ve scanned my computer and it has no viruses please help. And please don’t add to the situation by banning me =(</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>
<p>If you have been banned for Bug Abuse type this in your ban appeal:</p>
<p>Dear, Jagex</p>
<p>I’m sorry for doing this but i think it was a mis-understanding, i come across that bug accidently. and i was so excited of what i did i tried to do it again, but it didn’t work. I was trying to figure out how i did it exactly but i couldn’t re-do it. so i am sorry for doing it although it was an accident and i couldn’t repeat it, and i gained nothing out of it.</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>
<p>Thats all i got for now <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> More will come later ;D <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
