    <title>Undo a hosted server? if u help you are pro =]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/undo-a-hosted-server-if-u-help-you-are-pro/333529</link>
    <description>well, it starts like this: Some idiot posted their server in the &quot;server downloads&quot; section, but it connects to his server...lol...i mean, instead of it just running on your computer, he is hosting it and it connects to his...ip..or what ever. so how do i make it NOT connect to his thing... do i have to delete some files or something? what all do i need to change/get rid of to make it like any other server, and only connect to &#39;localhost&#39; aka your computer...im bad at explaining shiz so bare wit my plz :confused:

(so basicly, if you know how to host a server, tell me everything you do and edit and then i will undo it and what not...)
things i see on here that are not normally on other servers is:
deps folder: jython, log4j-1.2.15, mina-core-1.1.7, slf4j-api-1.5.3....
tons of .xml files, i am assuming has something to do with the internet, so the files are probably hosted on a site...
stuff like that...what the hell is all that??</description>
