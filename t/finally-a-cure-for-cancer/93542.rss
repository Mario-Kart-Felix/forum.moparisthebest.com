News Article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;SYDNEY (AFP) - Australian scientists said Friday they have developed a cancer treatment which could deliver lethal doses of drugs to tumours without the usual harmful side-effects such as nausea and hair loss.

Research scientist Jennifer MacDiarmid said the cutting-edge technique uses nanotechnology to create particles which directly attack cancer cells with a &quot;lethal payload&quot; of drugs, without flooding the body with toxic chemicals.

Treatments such as chemotherapy typically involve subjecting the patient&#39;s entire body to the powerful drugs in order to kill the cancer, causing debilitating side-effects that the new, targeted technique would eliminate.

&quot;Your hair wouldn&#39;t fall out, you wouldn&#39;t throw up... some chemotherapy is life-threatening in itself,&quot; MacDiarmid told AFP.

MacDiarmid said scientists at Sydney-based biotechnology company EnGeneIC, where she is a managing director, used a bacteria cell stripped of reproductive powers to develop a particle capable of carrying any chemotherapy drug.

The nano-cell, which is about one-fifth the size of a normal cell, is then tagged with antibodies which are attracted to cancerous tumours. Once the cell hits the cancer, the drug is released directly into the malignant growth.

&quot;There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel,&quot; MacDiarmid said.

The results of animal trials published this week in the US-based journal Cancer Cell show that the technique has reduced tumours in animals without toxic side-effects and by using only a very small amount of drugs.

MacDiarmid said the treatment could potentially be used on any solid tumours including those in the breasts, ovaries, colon and lungs.

In future, the treatment could allow for the creation of customised drug &quot;cocktails&quot; to be used on patients to counter drug resistance and could lower costs as a smaller amount of drugs would be needed, she said.

The team hopes to start human trials by the end of this year.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is so awesome. This technique could also be used to kill any number of other diseases like AIDS. :D I love nano technology and Australian Scientists. Finally someone doing something good in the world unlike a certain administration. :rolleyes: Any way, this could be the enormous medical break through that may go beyond curing cancer.

Anvirzel is a botanical drug derived from  the plant Nerium Oleander. A water-soluble  extract from Nerium Oleander was pioneered and patented by Dr. Huseyin Ziya Ozel,  a Turkish physician who began to experiment with these extracts in 1966.<br>
The reason no one knows about it and it is not used is because the government <a href="http://does%20not%20allow%20it%20to%20be%20FDA%20approved" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">does not allow it to be FDA approved</a>, and wants to continue to make money.</p>

<p>Damn them auto woodcutters! Plus ^^ (2 posts above) CONSPIRACY! Dont spread such crap.<br>
Anyways personally Ive lost 2 family members and a cat (It was a cool cat dont laugh =( ), I don’t know if a cure will eventuall be found. The only problem with treatment at the moment is that a tumor is basically a grop of mutated cells, radioactive rays (Gamma rays) can be used to kill cells, but you run the risk of mutating more cells resulting in the cancer spreading to other parts of the body. If only there was a way to kill a group of cells without using radiation (which is unlikely without removing them) =(</p>

<p>Considerable research effort is now devoted to the development of vaccines (to prevent infection by oncogenic infectious agents, as well as to mount an immune response against cancer-specific epitopes) and to potential venues for gene therapy for individuals with genetic mutations or polymorphisms that put them at high risk of cancer.</p>
<p>As of October 2005, researchers found that an experimental vaccine for HPV types 16 and 18 was 100% successful at preventing infection with these types of HPV and, thus, are able to prevent the majority of cervical cancer cases. This vaccine (Gardasil) was approved by the FDA in June 2006.</p>

<p>Anyway, why on earth would a company even “want” to cure cancer, it’ll mean a <span class="bbcode-b">major</span> decline in profits/donations for ‘cancer study’.

<p>Why do you think all of these other cures for diseases etc were flops? It’s a conspiracy man…</p>
