    <title>Because i seem to fuck over every memory drive i have</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/because-i-seem-to-fuck-over-every-memory-drive-i-have/248075</link>
    <description>Okay since i literally fuck up every memory drive i own, awhile ago i tried to install Ubuntu onto my Maxter oneTouch 4 500GB external drive, it horribly failed and i had to reformat the entire drive, after i did that i just put the drive into my closet avoiding the problem because i knew i really fucked it up. But now i need it for extra memory, and it no longer has an NTFS portion, the drive doesn&#39;t even show up as an external Drive (ex, drive F) in &quot;my computer&quot; but it shows its connected in the maxter manager program but the drive shows up as &quot;UNKOWN&quot; and has absolutely no information about the drive. i really need help plzzzz ): . i also emailed the support center at Maxtor website, they are no help at all since it has been over 5 days and have gotten no reply.

<p>yes you’d think but it doesn’t show up at all. this is really pissing me off, seagate is like fucking retarded, they don’t answer my support cases and when i go posting on their forums they tell me to go read a trouble shooting shit that doesn’t help at all even when i explained the problem.</p>

              <p>Okay since i literally fuck up every memory drive i own, awhile ago i tried to install Ubuntu onto my Maxter oneTouch 4 500GB external drive, it horribly failed and i had to reformat the entire drive, after i did that i just put the drive into my closet avoiding the problem because i knew i really fucked it up. But now i need it for extra memory, and it no longer has an NTFS portion, the drive doesn’t even show up as an external Drive (ex, drive F) in “my computer” but it shows its connected in the maxter manager program but the drive shows up as “UNKOWN” and has absolutely no information about the drive. i really need help plzzzz ): . i also emailed the support center at Maxtor website, they are no help at all since it has been over 5 days and have gotten no reply.</p>
