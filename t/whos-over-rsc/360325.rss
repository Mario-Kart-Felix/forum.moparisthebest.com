    <title>Who&#39;s over RSC?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whos-over-rsc/360325</link>
    <description>I came to the conclusion today that i am over RSC. Jagex will never properly host RSC again. That dreams of seeing thousands of players on a world with a little amount of botters is gone. Since RSC closed a long time ago, i have been apart of this community trying/hoping to play the same thing.. RSCD,RSCA,RSCE were the 3 servers that have done everything they could to bring back that feeling, but it&#39;s still not enough (at least for me).

I once believed 1000 players online (no multi loggers etc, no special events) was possible for an RSC private server, but the community and that amount of players just does not exist anymore. I will never play RSC again and it&#39;s time to face that. Closest that came for me was RSCD when Reines ran it, it was huge and i leveled my character mostly legit and was in the top 5 in highscores, but even that was only half way towards the goal i would have like to have seen.

I didn&#39;t expect RSC dev to go much further than it did after reines left, however it did go a lot further with RSCA and RSCE, in fact i believe around 90%+ replicated which is a damn good achievement. The servers will live on and they have done great, but the large amount of players is what made RSC, RSC to me, and that&#39;s not ever going to happen again. I&#39;m going to stick around, i know theres a few people that do like to play these little servers and have some fun, but nothing will compare to the fun i had back in real RSC, years i tried to get that feeling and it never got there (or maybe i even grown out of it) but yeah.. time to move on.

How do you all feel about this subject? still holding on for something thats never going to happen?</description>

<p>How do you all feel about this subject? still holding on for something thats never going to happen?[/quote]</p>
<p>RSC hasn’t had the same feel in years, not since it was hosted by JaGeX (for free), in all honesty. When I first started, it was all new, fresh. Things to explore, things to do. There was a great deal of curiosity involved which made it interesting. There was an “exploration” feel to the game. That can never be recaptured by replicating the game, as we already know everything to the game. I even remember when it was possible for me to get “lost” whilst walking the map of RuneScape Classic.</p>
<p>It’s definitely lost a qualitative aspect I can’t quite find the right words for. I remember when simply hitting high numbers felt cool, when having adamantite felt accomplishing, when being lent a few hundred gold was great. That was probably like 2001 for me, when I was a total noob. PKing was fun, actually caring about how many Ruby Amulets you had. That’ll never happen again, and even if people try, nobody’s going to put forth the effort that was once required with RuneScape Classic. It’s not a new game anymore.</p>
<p>Merching was great, there once was a time when there was 1000s of people doing every aspect of the game simultaneously, so the economy just came naturally without any effort. Where have all these other people gone? A lot went to RS2, a lot moved on, and a small percent who shared the memories either went seeking for or were told about a private server. My first private server other than the one I ran with you and Protosstribe, was RSCA when I came back a few years later and heard that RSC private servers were a bit more established. That kinda hit the spark for me for a bit, but it got old after a few months. The games okay, the magic is just gone. But like you I still occasionally lift a hand for development, if somebody needs help.</p>

Food will now only heal your pets and players regen hp with new healing spells or HP pots which are only made by herblore or dropped by npcs. so players can fight players or can battle their caught NPCs pokebattle-style haha. the npcs will have 4 fight moves, and gain EXP as you battle them and train them, that way not only do you train your player up, but if that gets boring you can train up your small npc army and go fuckin battle people</p>
