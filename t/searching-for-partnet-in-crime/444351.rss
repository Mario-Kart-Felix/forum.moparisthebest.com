    <title>Searching for partnet in crime! ;)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/searching-for-partnet-in-crime/444351</link>
    <description>I have finally found a base and source with a pretty nice client I&#39;d like to start off with.

It is a zepsity base.. yes I know. Actually this source has had ALOT of work done within&#39; it and is doing great!

I decided I would like a partner to code with. Whether it is over Skype™, Teamviewer™, or something else.

To do this, and for it to work.. we would have to live around the same time zones.
I live: (-6) Central Time in Texas, United States of America

For this, it would be great to have a team member (partner) to work with and help each other with coding when we get stuck, and also to have two different opinions when it comes to certain things. 

Thanks -KTHillman
