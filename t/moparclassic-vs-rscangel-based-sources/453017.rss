    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparclassic-vs-rscangel-based-sources/453017</link>
    <description>Can someone (in detail) please explain exactly why Moparclassic is a better base to build off of as compared to Rsca? People have told me it is because Rsca has many exploits, but is that the only reason? If so, what are the exploits and why cant they easily be fixed?

On another note:
Also, I noticed that Moparclassic had all of Rsca&#39;s custom content removed, is there a way to put it back in? Finally, can someone tell me how to base the commandhandler off java format instead of scala? Thank you :)</description>

How are the commands handled now?</p>
<p>Just curious, will check later when on the computer if no-one sheds any light on how there handled.<br>
[/quote]Previously there was a huge mess of if statements. Then, to make it even messier, in the single method, you had to make sure you put it in the right place, to ensure the user had proper permissions.</p>
<p>Now, permissions are in a configuration file, and commands are matched to the proper function.</p>
<p>Let’s look a command to see what else is different…</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<p><code>    static String[] towns = { "varrock", "falador", "draynor", "portsarim", "karamja", "alkharid", "lumbridge", "edgeville", "castle" };
    static Point[] townLocations = { Point.location(122, 509), Point.location(304, 542), Point.location(214, 632), Point.location(269, 643), Point.location(370, 685), Point.location(89, 693), Point.location(120, 648), Point.location(217, 449), Point.location(270, 352) };
</code></p>
<p><code>	if (cmd.equalsIgnoreCase("town")) {
	    try {
		String town = args[0];
		if (town != null) {
		    for (int i = 0; i &lt; towns.length; i++)
			if (town.equalsIgnoreCase(towns[i])) {
			    player.teleport(townLocations[i].getX(), townLocations[i].getY(), false);
			    return;
			}
		}
	    } catch (Exception e) {
		e.printStackTrace();
	    }
	}</code><br>
And that needed to be placed between the check for the player being a pmod and being a mod.</p>
<p>Now:</p>
<p><code>	val towns = List[(String, Point)](
		("varrock", Point.location(122, 509)),
		("falador", Point.location(304, 542)),
		("draynor", Point.location(214, 632)),
		("portsarim", Point.location(269, 643)),
		("karamja", Point.location(370, 685)),
		("alkharid", Point.location(89, 693)),
		("lumbridge", Point.location(120, 648)),
		("edgeville", Point.location(217, 449)),
		("castle", Point.location(270, 352))
	)</code></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p><code>	&lt;!-- Teleports the player to the specified town --&gt;
	&lt;permission name="town"&gt;1&lt;/permission&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>	def town(p : Player, args : Array[String]) {
		val town = args(0);
		CH.towns.find(e =&gt; e._1 equalsIgnoreCase town) match {
			case Some(x) =&gt; p.teleport(x._2.getX, x._2.getY, false)
			case None =&gt;
		}
	}</code></p>
<p>Now, let’s look at what has been improved or is different…</p>
<p>Lines of code wise, the new version is smaller (if you properly format the Java code), even if you include the XML that is required to set the permissions level.<br>
Where you put the method doesn’t matter anymore.<br>
We don’t have to explicitly loop through all the towns; we simply say, find me a town that matches.<br>
We don’t have to worry about ordering of towns and their locations, along with making sure there is a matching pair.<br>
We don’t have to worry about catching exceptions, but we can if we want to.<br>
We don’t have to have guards making sure things aren’t null.<br>
We can easily change who has access to the command, and we don’t even need to re-compile or change any code.<br>
Our mapping of towns to locations is now immutable.<br>
We don’t have to make sure we jump out of the method (calling return at the end) to make sure other commands won’t be executed and additional conditions won’t be checked.</p>
<p>Because of these changes, the Scala version is much more readable, even if you don’t know how to program it isn’t hard to figure out what’s going on. The same really can’t be said for the Java version.</p>

Jk, it’s because Moparclassic is a ton cleaner, for sure.</p>

It’s not hard at all to add the RSCA content back. If you had <em>ANY</em> Java knowledge you could do it, and you wouldn’t need to be spoonfed of everything.<br>

              <p>Can someone (in detail) please explain exactly why Moparclassic is a better base to build off of as compared to Rsca? People have told me it is because Rsca has many exploits, but is that the only reason? If so, what are the exploits and why cant they easily be fixed?</p>
<p>On another note:<br>
Also, I noticed that Moparclassic had all of Rsca’s custom content removed, is there a way to put it back in? Finally, can someone tell me how to base the commandhandler off java format instead of scala?
