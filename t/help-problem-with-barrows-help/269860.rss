    <title>[HELP] Problem with Barrows [HELP]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-problem-with-barrows-help/269860</link>
    <description>I was making barrows then decided to test it out, the thing is, when i get to Killcount 5 I try to open the tomb thing, and it&#39;s supposed to take you to the tunnels where you fight the last monster, however, it takes you to the start of barrows... I will give you the code and possibly you could tell me whats gone wrong?

[code]			case 6727:
				if (Barrows == 4 &amp;&amp; BarrowskillCount &gt;= 6 &amp;&amp; absX == 3551 &amp;&amp; absY == 9683) {
					ReplaceObject(objectX, objectY, objectID + 2, 0);
					ReplaceObject(3552, 9684, 6746, -2);
				}
				if (Barrows == 4 &amp;&amp; BarrowskillCount &gt;= 6 &amp;&amp; absX == 3552 &amp;&amp; absY == 9688) {
					ReplaceObject(objectX, objectY, objectID + 2, -2);
					ReplaceObject(3551, 9688, 6746, 0);
				}
				if (Barrows == 4 &amp;&amp; BarrowskillCount &lt;= 5) {
					Send(&quot;You need to defeat the last brother in the tunnels before you can open that!&quot;);
				}
				break;

			case 6746:
				if (Barrows == 4 &amp;&amp; BarrowskillCount &gt;= 6 &amp;&amp; absX == 3552 &amp;&amp; absY == 9683) {
					ReplaceObject(objectX, objectY, objectID + 2, -2);
					ReplaceObject(3551, 9684, 6727, 0);
				}
				if (Barrows == 4 &amp;&amp; BarrowskillCount &gt;= 6 &amp;&amp; absX == 3551 &amp;&amp; absY == 9688) {
					ReplaceObject(objectX, objectY, objectID + 2, 0);
					ReplaceObject(3552, 9688, 6727, -2);
				}
				if (Barrows == 4 &amp;&amp; BarrowskillCount &lt;= 5) {
					Send(&quot;You need to defeat the last brother in the tunnels before you can open that!&quot;);
				}
				break;[/code]
