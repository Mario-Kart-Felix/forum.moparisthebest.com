    <title>NPC NoClipping (317)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-noclipping-317/335104</link>
    <description>Hello,

I am running a 317 server and have a problem with the NPCs. If an NPC is free to roam anywhere, it can walk through walls and other obstacles, much like if a player were to do the command ::noclip. Not only is this a problem for random walking NPCs but also for summoned NPCs (Which follow the player, but walk through walls and other obstacles if necessary). I was wondering if there was a way to fix this? I apologise if this topic has arisen before.

Thanks, Shadowswoz.</description>

              <p>Pretty much all servers have this problem, but it CAN be fixed. I was looking around yesterday and there are a few tutorials on here. Just search: “Clipping”, and you SHOULD find something. The actual way would be to do it through your client, but I am honestly not sure how this is done. I hope I helped.</p>
