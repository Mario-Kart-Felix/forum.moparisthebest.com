Hey everyone, im bringing back Foxscape! This server is all original 317 and [b]NOT BASED ON DELTA..FUCK DELTA[/b]. This server was coded from scratch using winterlove v3. There are a few minor glitches like heads disappearing when equipping helmets, and you wont do damage without a sword, so thats just a few upgrades we have to make.

Thanks to a nice guy, we now have our own domain! Please visit the website and register to get extra benefits in the game. It is not integrated or anything, so I do the best i can by myself.

Server Features:
- Perfect Range
- Near Perfect Combat (except as described above)
- Teleporting sounds
- Near full teleports
- Magic works including animations and gfx
- No cheat items
- No dupes
- No glitches (except as described above.)
- Most Skills (Will List Below)
- Shops are on Quest Interface
- No lag, very stable. Anti-SYI (Most probably wont even know lol)

Working Skills:
- Mining
- Woodcutting
- Firemaking
- Smithing
- Herblore
- Fletching
- Fishing
- Crafting

Some more skills i don&#39;t know about. I&#39;m not even sure if they all work because i haven&#39;t used this source since [b]2007[/b].


PS. If someone can help me fix the head glitch when equipping helmets hood etc. You will receive Admin on server and &quot;PRO Supporter&quot; status on forums.</description>
