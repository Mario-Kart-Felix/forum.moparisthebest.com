    <title>Program to hack neopets</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/program-to-hack-neopets/170188</link>
    <description>Heres an Inline Proxy, lets you use your own computer as a proxy to monitor all traffic between your browser and whatever youre browsing. I didnt mess around with it much because I dont play neopets but thought somebody might be able to use it to modify the scores sent by games. It could be possible to write a program that uses this to send scores of each game, just go down the list, at random, and send decent scores for each game, with time in between to cause it to look real, allowing you to rack in 100k or so in a day, everyday, from the games, plus having  first or second place in the highscores earning you more every day. It also has a &#39;Spider&#39; browsing feature that lets it access links on the page you specify and might get you some good random events.

              <p>I’ve done something like this just for laughs, I used a scar script. After I got such a highscore, I got a message saying that my score would be investigated, then I would recieve my points or whatever their called. I would’t bother trying this. Also sounds like TamperData for Firefox does the same thing.</p>
