    <title>Question about shutting down a computer remotely</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-shutting-down-a-computer-remotely/9440</link>
    <description>I have two computers, one in my living room, and another in my bed room. I don&#39;t want to have to go to the other room just to turn it off. What services do I need enabled to shut it down remotely (shutdown -s -m \\*)?</description>
