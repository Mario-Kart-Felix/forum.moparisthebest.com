    <title>HD Sprite Hovering</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hd-sprite-hovering/477919</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been wanting to be able to use HD sprites for sprite hovering on interfaces for a while now. I have the original button(s) using HD sprites, it&#39;s just that I haven&#39;t been able to figure out how to make the sprite that shows whenever you hover your mouse over it be HD as well. I&#39;ve looked into RSInterface.java and it uses a method in client.java.

RSInterface:
[code]tab.type = 0;[/code]

My class9_1.type == 0 code just refers to the buildInterfaceMenu method.

And here&#39;s my buildInterfaceMenu method:

If anyone could give me hints on what to look for in my buildInterfaceMenu method, I&#39;d very much appreciate it.

And yes, my client can support HD sprites; I use them for almost everything on my client (minus sprite hovering). So no one ask that question.</description>
