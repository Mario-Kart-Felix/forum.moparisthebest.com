    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-would-be-a-good-614-base/445991</link>
    <description>i was using rscalifornia 711 when it got released and fixed the anti-leech but after readding barrows and half assing soulwars i noticed how its handling all these processes in a different way it seems like this will cause terrible lagg and alot of cpu will be used when 60+ players will be using this

well im fairly new to 602+ bases i just got into this since i moved on from project insanity 317 loading 614 :\ so will anyone suggest me a stable source loading 614+? like i said im new to this

now if we talk about 317&#39;s i know id be suggested hyperion &amp; apollo so yeah :)</description>
