    <title>Problems hosting server on laptop! [URGENT]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-hosting-server-on-laptop-urgent/371083</link>
    <description>Okay, so after quite a while, i finally made a RuneScape Private Server. It&#39;s a Rawr Pkz source which I think is a 317. Correct me if i&#39;m wrong. But anyways, the problem is, the server runs perfect on local host(127.0.0.1) but when i switch it to my no-ip, it goes a bit weird. Everything works fine, as in moving the camera, right click over stuff, hovering mouse over items/objects, but then when you try and click move, or click open bank or talk to an NPC, there is a 5-7second delay. The only think I can relate it to, is lag, which to me seems a bit odd as it isn&#39;t a frame rate issue, just delay in actions.

My Laptop Specs:

Any help would be VERY appreciated as I need a response soon!

              <p>The lag that you are facing may come from 2 different things, 1 of them may be that u have a lousy internet connection (obviously the only way to fix is to upgrade or buy a vps) the 2nd thing that may cause lag is customs, how ever i do now know what u mean by the no-ip, do u mean when other people connect, because u have to connect to local host or nothing at all will work, also if u need more help just ppm me on other questions have a nice day :D.</p>
