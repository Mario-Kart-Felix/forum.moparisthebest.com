    <description>this is now in general. minecraft,rsps..won&#39;t even load up at all.

hiya, was going to work on a 639 since i&#39;v been working on PI for few years in the past.
I just re-installed my Windows 7 and got everything i need to start coding/compiling.

So i start up source and get no errors, but when i launch my client it&#39;s stuck at 1%.

fact #1) my client IP is default gate way
fact #2) Obviously i run source before client.

I had this error in the past and i think it has something to do with my variables or something, i don&#39;t remember what exactly he did but it wasn&#39;t related to the files of the 639
but it was something to do in Control Panel. If anyone can help me it would be greatly appreciated :)</description>

              <p>FFS is everyone this dumb on this forum??? i know i ask some stupid questions but this is stupid… it means your client cant find your server, try port forwarding or look into changing the ip on the client, and just because you changed one variable saying string ServerIP=“127.0.0.1” doesn’t mean the server ip has changed there could be more than one ip varible</p>
