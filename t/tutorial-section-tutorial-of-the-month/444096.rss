    <title>Tutorial section &amp; tutorial of the month</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tutorial-section-tutorial-of-the-month/444096</link>
    <description>Taharok: This topic is for voting for 2 different features:
1. A separation of the tutorial section into a main board where the best tutorials are placed and a child board where all regular tutorials are posted by members
2. A creation of a &quot;tutorial of the month&quot; recognition award, where the best tutorials are judged under undecided criteria and the owner is rewarded with a badge recognizing them as an outstanding tutorial author, for exactly one month.

I feel as if we should implement the approval system for the Tutorial Section again.

I know we&#39;ve done this in the past, but we reverted back to free-for-all.

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a forum issue or just mitb&#39;s decision to stop that process?

[quote=&quot;asshole_rule&quot;]Sort of like Signature of the week, same concept.

In an order to get our tutorials section here at Moparscape booming with new tutorials monthly which we all would love, and I&#39;m sure could attract some more people, I&#39;m presenting the idea of tutorial of the month. It is simply a competition to see who&#39;s tutorial is the most unique, and the most helpful. It would be a lot of fun competing for the best tutorial imo, and like I said, get some new tutorials in the tutorial section which is desperately needed. 

Of course some obvious rules applied, like only your own work, and what not...[/quote]</description>

              <p>Snippet section, yes.</p>
<p>Also, the tutorial section needs to become approval only again. It’s getting out of hand. “Tutorials” are made over the same thing 3-5 times a day. “How to change the drops” is not a fucking tutorial. There probably needs to be one big starter tutorial with the basics, and then the rest should be decent, actual, thought out tutorials. But as it is right now, it’s ridiculous. Something needs to be done.</p>
<p>I’m aware that this would take a large amount of moderation in the beginning, so just appoint new moderators. There are plenty of people who would be able and willing to moderate the tutorial section.</p>

<p>Number 3(?) = no support, i feel mods may be to harsh and decline some tuts that might be semi useful for ripping out methods that other tuts which do the same may have and so forth.<br>
May i add i think that their should be a snippet section? Not just one thread with lots of snippets, i cba looking through a thread…</p>

^ pretty much sums it up David. Just because a mooderator has  contributed one way or another ( davidscape, highscores, etc ) does not mean they are the  experts in that  field to say "okay this tutorial is really good and helps people to learn blah "</p>
<p>Now…if those with specific badges had a say so such as “rs2 programmer” or “java guru” then yes they may have a fair chance of voting on tutorials.<br>

<p>There have been much larger and more popular tutorials/topics for the older staff members. That doesn’t matter though. Not all of the current vets would have been vets if not for them being staff first. Based on Lothy’s concept of the vet rank, most of the staff shouldn’t have access to it. I’m not trying to be mean or a jerk, it’s simply the truth. The rank is based on contribution to the actual development of rsps and only a few mods have contributed enough to earn that rank. That’s not to say they shouldn’t be honored with another rank that is the equivalent of mitb’s community member, though.<br>
[/quote]I didn’t know we were talking about vet, I thought we were talking about judging tutorials? These, er, normal members (;)) are implying that we don’t know enough to judge a tutorial. I would like to beg to differ, I don’t think you need to be an ‘expert’ of any field to judge a tutorial. If anything you should be mediocre, because then you can judge how well the tutorial teaches (which is what is important) instead of just being nitpicky at the content. In which case you may as well search the entire internet for the most knowledgeable person so that you can make sure every little detail is correct  :rolleyes: And then I wouldn’t even call vets ‘experts’ either.</p>

</aside>
<p>A few posts back you pretty much said all mods are qualified to judge, I’m not implying that you don’t know enough to judge a tutorial. I just don’t think ALL of them should be judges just because they’re moderators.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure all of us have written a quality tutorial or made a good contribution (development wise) of some sort. I’d be happy to throw together a list for you for each moderator? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Are you not implying with that sentence that all mods are qualified?[/quote]Indeed I am. I do not believe there is a single moderator dumb enough to not be able to judge a tutorial and tell if it is well written.</p>
