<p>Most of the tutorials now would be considered snippets and therefore go to that board. Essentially, I’m thinking of tutorials becoming reply only with a child board that can be openly posted in. The best tutorials are moved to the main board where they are openly flaunted to the community, as being the elite tutorials.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure all of us have written a quality tutorial or made a good contribution (development wise) of some sort. I’d be happy to throw together a list for you for each moderator? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Are you not implying with that sentence that all mods are qualified?<br>
[/quote]Indeed I am. I do not believe there is a single moderator dumb enough to not be able to judge a tutorial and tell if it is well written.</p>

<p>That may be right, but it brings us back to what tL said &gt;.&lt;<br>
[/quote]What tL said was not about this, and Loveandpower quoting it was completely out of context. It may still be somewhat relevant, but to give you brief context it was about reputation, not ‘judging’ anything.[/quote]</p>
