    <description>ever since i jarred my client ive had problems logging onto my server.

before you say, have you portforwarded, checked ports etc.
well, yes i have. i sent out the client to a few friends with the class files so they could test, and we could all log on perfectly, no i jarred my client, it says &quot;server is offline, please retry every 2 hours&quot; but yet sometimes i can log in and sometimes i get that message, never had this problem before.</description>
