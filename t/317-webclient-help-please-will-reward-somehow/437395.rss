    <title>317 Webclient Help (Please ; Will Reward, somehow)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-webclient-help-please-will-reward-somehow/437395</link>
    <description>I&#39;m so stumped, I&#39;ve spent the past 6 months or so working on my source and now i&#39;m getting ready to release it to the public, however.. I cannot get the webclient to work properly, I following ric&#39;s webclient tutorial and i did everything correctly. When i go to load my webclient i get the following error, &quot;Client updated - please reload client!&quot; it shows that for a second or two and then it says, &quot;Connection error - Retrying in #&quot; and it&#39;s a countdown clock. Could someone help me with fixing this or at least tell me what the problem may be, i&#39;ve done professional website design for the past 6 years, and if you could help me with getting my webclient to work i can offer you some website design for your server, depending on what you need. Any lead as to why this may be happening would be greatly appreciated, let me know please. - Eclipse Ruins</description>
