    <title>Is it wrong to kill something with artificial thoughts?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-it-wrong-to-kill-something-with-artificial-thoughts/542449</link>
    <description>One of the main &quot;worries&quot; about the developments in artificial intelligence is the worry that the intelligent things created will have feelings and thoughts akin to our own.

For this debate, please take the viewpoint that murdering an artificial being which has developed its own thoughts, dreams, aspirations and memories throughout its lifetime is morally the same as murdering a human.

If, instead of the memories being crafted due to the being having experienced the events, the memories are simply implanted into the beings mind, how does it change the moral consequences of killing the being?</description>

              <p>One of the main “worries” about the developments in artificial intelligence is the worry that the intelligent things created will have feelings and thoughts akin to our own.</p>
<p>For this debate, please take the viewpoint that murdering an artificial being which has developed its own thoughts, dreams, aspirations and memories throughout its lifetime is morally the same as murdering a human.</p>
<p>If, instead of the memories being crafted due to the being having experienced the events, the memories are simply implanted into the beings mind, how does it change the moral consequences of killing the being?</p>
