    <title>Stereotypes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stereotypes/3300</link>
    <description>&quot;I&#39;m a guy, so I only want to get into your pants.&quot;

This one stereotype is the one that pisses me off the most. True, most guys simply want only that. And as a result of this stereotype it has hard for most girls to believe that the guy in question simply wants to just be your friend. Not every guy is like that, not all of us are assholes.

The entire concept of stereotyping is just wrong.

Here are some bullshit ones =\

[code]
I don&#39;t eat much, so i must be anorexic

I&#39;m a prep, so I must eat and breathe Abercrombie and Fitch.

I&#39;m a teenager, so I must drink and do drugs.

I&#39;m a cheerleader or dancer, so I must be a whore.

I&#39;m a punk, so I must do drugs.

I&#39;m young, so I must be naive.

I&#39;m rich, so I must be a snob, conceided.

I wear black, so I must be gothic.

I smell, so I must be a hobo.

i&#39;m a skater so i must be an anarchist

I&#39;m only 15, so I must not know what love is.

I&#39;m blonde, so i must be stupid.

Im bi so i must be looking at you in a sexual way

I&#39;m pretty and i flirt, so i must not be a virgin

I&#39;m Straight Edge , So if you aren&#39;t edge i must hate you

I&#39;m gay/lesbian, I must be a sexual predator.

I&#39;m scene, so I must hate you if your not.

I have a family who isn&#39;t hurting for anything, so therefore I must not work for anything in my life.

my parents are gay/lesbian,so i must be gay/lesbian

I don&#39;t believe in God, I must love Satan.

I&#39;m liberal, so I must hate anyone who&#39;s not.

I&#39;m white, so I must be a racist.

I&#39;m a girl, so I must have no common sense.

i&#39;m popular, so i must easily give into peer pressure

i&#39;m gothic, I must hate life and want to die

I am diffrent, i must be dangerous

I&#39;m smart, I must do all the work for you

I&#39;m short, I must not be as good as everyone else

I&#39;m in marching band and go to band camp, I must do all the stuff in American Pie: Band Camp

I&#39;m a girl, I must just want to make out with guys

I&#39;m extroverted, I must not know how to shut up

I&#39;m talkative, I must be ADHD

I&#39;m friendly, I must just flirt with everyone

I&#39;m academic, I must not ever play sports outside

I&#39;m a loner, so I must have no friends.

I&#39;m white, so I must be ignorant of racial issues.
[/code]

The point that I am trying to make with this post is that these stereotypes exist only because people are uneducated.  If more people understood other cultures then these stereotypes would become irrelevant and fade into obscurity.</description>

<p>Lol most of the white people in the boonies of new hampshire are complete morons. It’s okay to make general assumptions, but not to go overboard.</p>
<p>iplox makes a point too, but it’s never the case. Everyone isn’t always this way. Except… all Black people are black people lol, you could say that. General assumptions are okay by using the word ‘most’. Most jewish people are smart. Most White people are Catholic. Most governments suck.</p>
<p>Unless you say, ALL black people are bad or something dumb like that. Then I would call that sterotyping.</p>
<p>PaulT prejudism means Pre Judging. I’m not prejudging, I’ve judged and been around the people that I’m judging, and I’m judging after I’ve met them, talked to them, and found out how stupid they are. Not all people from NH are dumb, but a lot of them are. I went to New York city, and they are much smarter. Would you call that prejudging? Nope, cause I have been there, spoken to the people, and found out they are intelligent.</p>

<p>Exactly my point.  An educated statement is completely opposite than a blind assumption.</p>

<p>Bullshit! That’s not the end of the story.</p>

<p>This is wrong because pattern recognition is not racism/sexism/etc… and is a part of how our brains function, and stereotypes are not always negative.</p>

              <p>I think this thread is stereotyping all stereotypes as stupid. Stereotypes can be useful.</p>
<p>When you see a mexican guy climbing around on top of somebodies roof, you don’t think "Hmm, he’s probably from MIT doing research on the properties of different tile collusion methods, you think, “Hmm, he’s probably an illegal immigrant.” So instead of being upset and calling the authorities when he falls and breaks his leg, you take another hit off the bong and lay back, wondering where the hell you left your lucky bufallo nickel.</p>
