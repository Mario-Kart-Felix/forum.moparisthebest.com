    <title>Blue Screen With Error Comes Up On Laptop Randomly</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/blue-screen-with-error-comes-up-on-laptop-randomly/442130</link>
    <description>Hey, So any time I use my laptop a blue screen with an error comes up and this is what the error says.

[code=text]A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.

The dxgkrnl has encountered an unexpected fatal error.

If this is the first time you&#39;ve seen this Stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps:

Check to make sure any new hardware or software is porperly installed.
If this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manufacturer for any windows updates you might need.

If porblems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware or software. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. If you need to use Safe Mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup Options, and the select Safe Mode.

Technical Information:

***  STOP:  0x00000113  (0x0000000000000004, 0xFFFFFA80029B268, 0x00000000000000000, 0x00000000000000000)

Collecting data for crash dump ...
Initializing disk for crash dump ...[/code]

How do I fix this it is so annoying.

Thanks, Mr Rushed</description>

              <p>It may have to do with DirectX, although I’m not entirely sure. Try reinstalling it.</p>
<p>Your error is usually the result of a hardware malfunction or device driver issue. It is also possible to receive a Blue Screen Error due to bad system memory, malfunctioning power supply, components overheating, or hardware overclocked beyond its specification. In older versions of the Windows OS you may also receive Blue Screen Errors due to incompatible DLL files.<br>
