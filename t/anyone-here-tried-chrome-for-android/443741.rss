i’ve used it quite a bit, and love it - the integration with desktop, tab management, smoothness, and omnibox functionality are all welcome on my phone<br>
however, out of the three phones i’ve tested it on (htc evo 4g, samsung nexus s 4g, and samsung galaxy s2 epic 4g touch) it only ran smoothly on my s2… on the evo, it was unbearably laggy, and on the nexus s while it worked most of the time there were a few issues where it would hang or freeze up the phone - although some of that probably had to do with the roms i was using.<br>
regardless, stock ics browser is amazing, and contains most of the functionality of chrome, although less polish… flash support is nice in stock browser, although i rarely ever find the need for it. i say if your device can handle chrome, use it, but if it causes you any issues you’ll be able to have 95% of it’s functionality just from the stock browser<br>

it /is/ in beta[/quote]<br>
I understand, and have no issues with it, only meant to speak my experiences with it in its current state<br>
ps posting from it right now</p>

Same deal, I like it but I’ll wait a few more months before actually using it. For now the stock browser is fine.</p>

              <p>I’ve had no problems with the default browser on Android 4; it loads fast and runs smoothly - what more could you ask for! The core of this chrome browser and the android browser is undoubtedly going to the same so I don’t see much point.</p>
<p>I too am unable to install this, most likely because I have an armv6 processor: I presume this browser is optimized for armv7.</p>
