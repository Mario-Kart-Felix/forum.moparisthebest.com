    <title>Need someone to TEAMVIEW or SKYPE with me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-someone-to-teamview-or-skype-with-me/431122</link>
    <description>Hello, can someone TeamView or Skype me? I have my RSPS set up (317 Delta), but for some reason people get an error message saying &quot;Sorry, loading char profile.&quot; 
I am led to believe that this is a problem within the client.java file because I PORT FORWARDED CORRECTLY, AND HAVE A NO-IP SETTUP. Please no comments on &quot;OH just setup a No-Ip or you didn&#39;t Port Forward correctly.&quot; Because I did..

So, thanks to anyone who helps :)

Skype - Pedobearsson  -  Max Bulgatz
TeamViewer - PM ME FOR INFO


THANKS ALL!</description>

<p>Well, you could either replace what you posted with the correct values (found in a 317 deob), or you can search through your server, and find where the login response codes are 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, or 12, and see which one of them is actually preventing the player from loggin in.</p>
