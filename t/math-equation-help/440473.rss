<p>He made 7, completely pointless topics in one day.  And from reading through this topic, it doesn’t seem like he knows anything about what he’s asking, which makes me believe he’s not actually studying this.</p>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with it, it’s a perfectly valid equation. What I mean is that, at least to me, there is no real point in subtracting any number from a factorial. Bear in mind, Maths was only a minor subject in my education. We only used, and I know we doesn’t really cover the entire mathematical world, but we only used factorials in probability calculations. So 5! would be the odds of 5 sequential events, which exclude itself after that event took place. Like picking teammates for a game of dodgeball. Once someone is picked, you can’t pick him again.</p>
<p>In that case, there is no point in subtracting any number from a factorial. Or is there? I know the point is to teach factorials, but still.[/quote]<br>
Most factorials I’ve found surface in discrete mathematics, probability or sequences/series and most of the time they’re in a fractional form where terms will quickly cancel. I don’t recall ever adding a constant to a factorial, however.</p>

<p>In mathematics, any of the positive integers that occurs as a coefficient in the binomial theorem is a binomial coefficient. Commonly, a binomial coefficient is indexed by a pair of integers n ≥ k ≥ 0 and is written
