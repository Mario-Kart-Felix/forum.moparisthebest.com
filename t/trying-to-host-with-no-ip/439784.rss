    <title>Trying to Host With No-IP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trying-to-host-with-no-ip/439784</link>
    <description>Well, obviously I&#39;m trying to host an rsps off my computer, which I&#39;ve done before but something is going wrong which I don&#39;t understand. I&#39;ve portforwarded and checked on http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/ to make sure that my port was opened. It was and I created my no-ip and have done all of that and changed my client IP to the no-ip domain that I have since my IP changes from time to time. Went into client.java and changed the line where my IP is to 
server = &quot;*******.servergame.com&quot;;
 but it won&#39;t connect and I don&#39;t understand why. Anyone have a step that I may be missing and could help me out with?</description>
