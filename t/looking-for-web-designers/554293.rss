<p>Hi I’m Josh a front end web developer,</p>
<p>I design &amp; build websites using: HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript &amp; jQuery.</p>
<p>Your website needs to be built on solid foundations, with clean, well structured code, to ensure it displays correctly to your clients and customers whatever technology they use to browse the internet.</p>
<p>I’d be happy to help feel free to contact me.<br>
[/quote]This looks like a cover letter by a dude from India<br>
[/quote]I showed this around the office and everyone said the same thing.</p>
<p>"My Name is X,</p>
<p>I use X X and X and this gives you X result</p>
<p>If you’d like to please your customers I am your choice</p>
<p>I’d be happy to help"</p>
<p>Josh, if you go into freelancing, look at a guy called Daniel DiPiazza. He’s now well on the way to being a millionaire and runs an entire brand named “Rich20Something”, he started out with things like web design and digital marketing and he shows you an AWESOME way to pitch new prospects and close 5 figure deals with ease. Idk what you do but he’s cool to look at regardless.</p>
<p>Quick tip: One thing any website designer or developer with any clue about what they’re doing will discredit straight away is someone who lists what they use “I use HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript &amp; jQuery”, as a website designer you’re expected to know those at a MINIMUM. A lot of more learning or medicore designers are coming up as though knowing something like CSS3 is a huge accomplishment but as a designer you’re EXPECTED to keep up to date with the latest practices in your field so when someone comes to me with a CV or resume listing that I’m just like “so why should I care that you know the basic materials for you to do your job?” “Is that all I should expect, the basics?” and then they get all flustered and scared.</p>
<p>If you wanna talk more about how to pitch prospects and close deals etc I can go a bit more in detail for you.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sure I totally understand you and yes I’ve probably got to work on my pitch prospects because I haven’t added that in-depth information on subjects and I’ve only added basic materials like you said.</p>
<p>Thanks and yes I would love to talk more about how to pitch prospects and close deals,</p>

Hi I’m Josh a front end web developer,</p>
<p>I design &amp; build websites using: HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript &amp; jQuery.</p>
<p>Your website needs to be built on solid foundations, with clean, well structured code, to ensure it displays correctly to your clients and customers whatever technology they use to browse the internet.</p>
<p>I’d be happy to help feel free to contact me.<br>
[/quote]This looks like a cover letter by a dude from India[/quote]I showed this around the office and everyone said the same thing.</p>
<p>"My Name is X,</p>
<p>I use X X and X and this gives you X result</p>
<p>If you’d like to please your customers I am your choice</p>
<p>I’d be happy to help"</p>
<p>Josh, if you go into freelancing, look at a guy called Daniel DiPiazza. He’s now well on the way to being a millionaire and runs an entire brand named “Rich20Something”, he started out with things like web design and digital marketing and he shows you an AWESOME way to pitch new prospects and close 5 figure deals with ease. Idk what you do but he’s cool to look at regardless.</p>
<p>Quick tip: One thing any website designer or developer with any clue about what they’re doing will discredit straight away is someone who lists what they use “I use HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript &amp; jQuery”, as a website designer you’re expected to know those at a MINIMUM. A lot of more learning or medicore designers are coming up as though knowing something like CSS3 is a huge accomplishment but as a designer you’re EXPECTED to keep up to date with the latest practices in your field so when someone comes to me with a CV or resume listing that I’m just like “so why should I care that you know the basic materials for you to do your job?” “Is that all I should expect, the basics?” and then they get all flustered and scared.</p>
<p>If you wanna talk more about how to pitch prospects and close deals etc I can go a bit more in detail for you.</p>

<h3><a href="https://html5up.net/spectral" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Spectral by HTML5 UP</a></h3>

<p>A big, modern, blocky affair with a mobile-style menu, fully responsive styling, and an assortment of pre-styled elements. So, pretty much what you were expecting -- except, of course, for how it's put together, specifically: Skel 3, flexbox, more...</p>


  </article>
  <div class="onebox-metadata">
    
    
  </div>
  <div style="clear: both"></div>

<p>Now, even if you acknowledge that the template isn’t yours, isn’t it pretty ironic to provide a website development service when you didn’t even make the template for your own website?</p>

<p>I would agree. It’s like a web designer whose portfolio is a collection of pre-made templates – unless there’s something really special about what you did, there’s no reason for you to be showing off something you didn’t design.</p>
