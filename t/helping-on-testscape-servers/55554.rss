    <description>i can code on testscape servers, but i want a few things

- good uptime, and owner knows what hes doing (compiling, and running server)

- he has msn, is nice and as soon as i did the first update i will get player rights 2 (or 3)

- he can NOT! buy/sell accounts, or mod/admin spots in his server, as i think its dumb

thats it.. you can speak to me trough msn bart_sloot@hotmail.com or just pm me

thank you for your time

P.S.
for people who say i want to steal source aslong as you have the requirements ill even do an unedited source

the reason why i do this is: i see only pimp servers lately, wich i like but i want non-pk servers aswell
