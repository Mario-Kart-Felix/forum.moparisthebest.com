Why Swebbyscape?
Here on Swebbyscape, we listen to our players. We have polls so that we can give what our players want. Staff positions here are not given out freely, they are earned. This means that we [b]do[/b] have a great staff team, along with the rest of the community. 

How to play? 
Sadly, we do not have a webclient, [i][b]yet.[/b][/i] To play, you&#39;re going to want to go to our client, [url=http://swebbyscape-net.webs.com/apps/forums/topics/show/7858919-swebbyscape-s-comback-official-download-client-]here.[/url] Download the .zip or .rar, whichever you prefer, and unzip or extract the file onto your desktop. Double click either of the Play Now! files and you should be good to go! If no, please use the help.txt file located in the folder. 

Features:
Daily updates!
VPS!
Custom Items! (Lightsaber, Deathcape, PvP Armour, and many many more!)
Custom Zones! (We use these zones to display off our bosses, are training areas, and other work)
Casket Gambling System!
Dicing!
All skills have been/will be reworked!
Player vs. Player!
Shops that will not prevent economy!
Bosses that drop rare items! (Godwars, Pheonix, Corporal Beast, KBD, Chaos Elemental, &amp; more!)
Donator Zone/Donator only features!

History: &quot;Swebbyscape has been off and on through out the years and hasn&#39;t been able to catch a break. Whether it be a hoster disappearing at random, or not enough money to keep it going. So, Mista Pnut has been gracious enough to take it into his own hands and bring Swebbyscape back to life! Whether you are an old player, or just starting out, we&#39;re always happy to see players back in-game.&quot;
