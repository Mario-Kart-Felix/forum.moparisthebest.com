    <title>School next year</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/school-next-year/442031</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m going to DigiPen Institute of Technology. I went to some private school for my first year out of HS, but I&#39;m transferring to DigiPen. How many have you heard of this school? I get mixed crowds who&#39;ve heard it and who haven&#39;t (mostly haven&#39;t). Where are you guys going next year if you are graduating this year? Where are you going now if you already graduated from HS? Let&#39;s get some higher education talk up in here!</description>

Never heard of it but then again I haven’t really paid any attention into colleges as this is just my freshmen year of HS. I recently got accepted for a partnership at my school and now have a summer job working as an intern. Learned about 3 weeks of Cisco networking so far.<br>

<p>That’s actually pretty cool. Do you have a linked in profile?</p>

<p>All I have to say is holy shit. If you can manage that, serious kudos. That’s a really hard workload. Best of luck to you! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:8, topic:442031”]I’ve heard of digipen in passing, don’t know much about it.</p>
<p>I’m doing community college for now, lots cheaper and most of the credits are transferable – it’s a good way to get the ‘degree requirements’ like college english, etc out of the way, before going to a university that specializes in something, like technology courses for digipen[/quote]</p>
<p>Naturally, I’ll disagree. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> If you get all your gen ed’s out of the way and then focus on specialty classes, you’ll run into a lot of problems. For example, you may have an exact course load you need to take each fall, spring, next fall, next spring (especially at small schools) in order to graduate on time. If you spend your first 2 years doing gen eds, but need to do 6 or 7 consecutive semesters of specialty classes to earn a degree. Now you’re going to be in school for 11 or more semesters, rather than 8. Order matters a lot. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>And as far as DigiPen goes, they have no general eds. So it wouldn’t matter anyway. :rolleyes:</p>
