    <title>Request to have an open discussion with Greeny?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/request-to-have-an-open-discussion-with-greeny/205761</link>
    <description>All of this crap seriously needs to stop.

Greeny is simply trash talking behind my back, completely bullshitting just to make me look like an uncontrollable, immature asshole.

For example, apparently I sent him a pm that challenged all authority.

And what was my PM that challenged all authority on this forum?  This:

[quote=&quot;xxlegitxx&quot;][quote author=Greeny link=topic=270926.msg2225411#msg2225411 date=1210819525]
Why the hell are you turning this thread into yet another flame war. 

As far as offtopic nonsense goes, now is the time to shut up and if anyone feels the need to carry on beyond this post they may find a dot slaps them in the face.
[/quote]

Explain to me how [b]I[/b] am responsible for this flame war, moron?[/quote]

First of all, I did NOT challenge all authority on this forum, contrary to what he stated.  The only authority I have challenged is that of Greeny and occasionally, Mopman, and collectively those who do not at least attempt to display impartiality while modding.

Second of all, in that thread, Yz started the flames, and I responded with flames of an equal or lower degree.  For those of you too lazy to look at the thread, I&#39;ve copied it here for you.

Out of the blue:

[quote=&quot;Yz85Racer, post:26, topic:205263&quot;]Watch out, xxlegitxx may rage at you got using incorrect English.[/quote]

[quote=&quot;xxlegitxx, post:31, topic:205263&quot;][quote author=Yz85Racer link=topic=270926.msg2223455#msg2223455 date=1210688649]
Watch out, xxlegitxx may rage at you [b]got[/b] using incorrect English.
[/quote]

Why do your sentences never make sense?[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Yz85Racer, post:45, topic:205263&quot;]Haha, you caught onto that. Believe it or not, you may be smarter than a rock.

(Incase you&#39;re wondering, I put that their to be a prick. l0l)[/quote]

[quote=&quot;xxlegitxx, post:46, topic:205263&quot;]Ah yes.  Cover up mistakes by claiming they were intentional.  Brilliant plan.[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Cowie`, post:47, topic:205263&quot;]And the prick still does not know when to shut the fuck up.[/quote]

[quote=&quot;xxlegitxx, post:48, topic:205263&quot;]I know when to shut the fuck up.  And it&#39;s not now.[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Greeny, post:49, topic:205263&quot;]Why the hell are you turning this thread into yet another flame war. 

As far as offtopic nonsense goes, now is the time to shut up and if anyone feels the need to carry on beyond this post they may find a dot slaps them in the face.[/quote]

So after weeks of endless talking behind my back, I request that Greeny and I have a gentlemen&#39;s discussion, one that is public so he cannot simply twist what I say to make him look better and me look worse.

I also do not attack everyone who associates with Greeny.  I attack anyone who attacks me.  If you look through all my posts, you can clearly see that.</description>

<p>Sure, nohope.  I just request that if this is approved, only Greeny and I post in that (or this) thread.</p>
<p>Also, I hope you all realize that basically, <span class="bbcode-b">this is my understanding of how the situation arose:</span></p>
<p>I reported Greeny for a post in which he clearly power abused.  He pm-ed me, bitching about how I’m not his friend anymore, and that I should go hug Fastbawlz.</p>
<p>So I look through his recent posts.  Over 50% were spam or flame.  So going on, I reported a lot of spam posts from Greeny as well as other spam posts from CM’s.  Then he edits nohope’s post, I believe.  This, combined with all the spam and flame posts he made, led me to post a thread on how Greeny is unfit for modship.</p>
<p>So the admins moved the thread after a big flame war.  Basically everyone who supported Greeny posted, and everyone against Greeny just pm-ed me or repped me about how they agreed with me.  From then on, Greeny, along with Mopman, started spreading all kinds of shit about me.  They provoked me in threads, and blamed the resulting flame war on me, they blew what I said out of proportion (what I said about Fastbawlz blew up from a facetious insinuation to a full-blown accusation).</p>
<p>From that point on, I’ve been temp banned for a week (no explanation other than: i’m tired of your shit.), I’ve been warned for retaliating for a flame, and I’ve been warned again for making a innocuous comment.  Of course, if anyone else did these things, admins/mods would look the other way.  Greeny has been going in mod sections and on IRC making shit up about me, and bending my words and phrases, fueling the fire.  I’ve basically been the person everyone loves to hate, which was fun for a while, but now it’s getting old.</p>
<p>[quote=“Mopman, post:6, topic:205761”]I have no problem with you disputing my impartiality - dispute it all you like, just do it at least semi-politely and without spamming/flaming me or others. You do not dispute, you just cause annoyance.</p>
<p>I do feel I am impartial though, so if you would like to point me to a case where I have not been, I shall apologise or remedy the situation however I see fit.[/quote]</p>
<p>Provide specific examples of where I cause annoyance.  The way I see it, it’s just a part of a self-fulfilling cycle.  An elitist insults me, I retort with equal or lesser force, and I am blamed for flaming and causing annoyances.</p>
<p>Explain why I was temp banned for a week, with EXAMPLES.  Also, all the “legit is dumb as fuck” comments should be taken back, as I have proven to you that in the Oxford dictionary, proofread is a word, and proof-read is not.</p>
<p>[quote=“Frostie21, post:7, topic:205761”]The first post just shows that Greeny is an idiot.Honestly how can he say you started that flame war?</p>
<p>I want to see how this discussion turns out…[/quote]</p>
<p>Also, I have a question for you… talk to me on MSN/AIM.</p>
