    <title>Needing an Oak Log Buyer/Bank Runner/Plank runner</title>

    <description>Hello
I am currently on F2P buying oak logs from general stores for 6gp each
I walk to the bank with 16k in inventory, nothing else.
Buy full inventory of Oak logs, then walk back to the bank

Then after I recieve about 10k logs, I run back and forth to the Varrock Lumber Mill
And have my logs turned into Oak planks for 250 each, They sell on forums in bulk 550 each

You won&#39;t believe how long and boring this process is
So, Since its F2P, Why not auto?


I am looking for a script that will do the following:

&gt; Walk to general store 
&gt; Trade shop keeper 
&gt; Buy &#39;10&#39; oak logs (3 Times) 
&gt; Walk to bank
&gt; Bank oak logs
&gt; (Repeat)

And then another script that will do the following:

&gt; Withdraw &#39;All&#39; oak logs (Till full inventory)
&gt; Walk to &#39;Lumber mill&#39; 
&gt; Buy plank &#39;Sawmill Operator&#39;
&gt; Buy &#39;All&#39; Oak plank
&gt; Walk to bank
&gt; (Repeat)

I&#39;d really appreciate it if someone could make these scripts
They&#39;d make everyone loads of money on the Construction forums :)</description>
