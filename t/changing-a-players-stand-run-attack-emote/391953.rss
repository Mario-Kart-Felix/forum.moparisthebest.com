    <title>Changing a players stand/run/attack emote?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-a-players-stand-run-attack-emote/391953</link>
    <description>Hey, I was wondering which class I would need to look in to change the run, stand, attack, etc. emotes?

I&#39;m trying to add shapeshifting, and when players transform they&#39;re all screwed up lol.

Thanks.  :rolleyes:</description>
