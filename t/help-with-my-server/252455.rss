    <title>Help with my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-my-server/252455</link>
    <description>Okay, I hope this is the right place to post this (I&#39;m not very good with forums -.-)
I just was wondering if there was anyone who would be willing to create a server with me (Hamachi server)
Ya&#39; know, kind of like a team to help code and such? So yeah, if anyone would like to help me out, I&#39;d really appreciate it =).  

-Foxeh.

P.S I really hope this was the right board to post on! &gt;&lt;</description>

              <p>It seems to be more reliable then an No-Ip service host.  I really don’t want to use an No-Ip, because it doesn’t have a built in chat that I can keep track of my members with; which is the main reason I use Ham. Thank you for your suggestion!</p>
