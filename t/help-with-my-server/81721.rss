    <title>Help with my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-my-server/81721</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t get to the help section, so I would appreciate if a mod moved this.

Anyways,

None of my NPCS die. They just stopped working correctly. They get to 0 hp&#39;s then don&#39;t die. It happened once before but just started working again. I would appreciate help. They DO have correct HP&#39;s.

Thanks irl.</description>
