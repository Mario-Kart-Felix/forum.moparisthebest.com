I am not for pot, or anyway support it but here’s a cool fact<br>
I think pot should be illegal due, to it ruining young children’s lives and having access to them, can ruin their lives forever, (I haven’t looked up the harmful effects of marijuana but whatever</p>

[/quote]<br>
well let’s say for an instance, I have an older brother, he got in to pot because it’s “cool”<br>
and lets say “I” am not as cool, because the cool people smoke, drink and stuff, and usually young children like to follow the footsteps of an older sibling, if it was legalized, everyone would have access to them,<br>
lets see the harmful effects:<br>
The short-term effects of marijuana include:<br>
Distorted perception (sights, sounds, time, touch)<br>
Problems with memory and learning<br>
Loss of coordination<br>
Trouble with thinking and problem-solving<br>
Increased heart rate, reduced blood pressure<br>
Sometimes marijuana use can also produce anxiety, fear, distrust, or panic.<br>
Effects on the Brain</p>
<p>The active ingredient in marijuana, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, acts on cannabinoid receptors on nerve cells and influences the activity of those cells. Some brain areas have many cannabinoid receptors, but other areas of the brain have few or none at all. Many cannabinoid receptors are found in the parts of the brain that influence pleasure, memory, thought, concentration, sensory and time perception, and coordinated movement.<br>
When high doses of marijuana are used, usually when eaten in food rather than smoked, users can experience the following symptoms:</p>
<p>Hallucinations<br>
Delusions<br>
Impaired memory<br>
Disorientation<br>
It should not be legalized, in anyway.<br>

as it impairs young minds.<br>

I saw hallucinations and didn’t read it.<br>
It’s not the pot that ruins children’s lives, it’s the life style they associate pot with.</p>

Doing something stupid and getting killed while high is a whole different story.[/quote]Errrrrrrrr, no. Zyle is right. You can’t have your cake and eat it too. If you’re going to use the word ‘directly’, alchohol can cause liver disease, but it’s not ‘direct’. Smoking wouldn’t be ‘direct’ either. Marijuana has quite a similar effect, in that it can detrimentally harm your immune system (which is often overlooked by people that use weed, because it’s not a clear side effect like black lung). So if you’re going to say ‘direct’, the only thing that has a direct effect would be something like drowning or taking a bullet to the head.</p>

<p>Exactly, think about this.<br>
The statement “There has been no death directly attributed to guns.” is entirely true. Guns, by themselves, have never killed a person. I requires someone to shoot it, something to shoot, and have the shot hit someone or something, causing death.</p>
<p>Polio has also never directly killed someone. Polio is just a virus. It’s the <span class="bbcode-b">contraction</span> of the virus, and inability of the immune system to defend against it that killed them.</p>
<p>Tornados have also never directly killed someone. It’s the destruction caused by the tornado, and various objects being flown at a high rate of speed, killing them.</p>

I’m not a non pot smoker but you don’t need to do something to know about something you don’t do… I don’t jump of cliffs but I know thats a stupid thing to do, see the logic? Not saying doing pot is stupid ofc.</p>

Yeah I do.</p>
<p>I seen a post where someone said weed causes stress, I smoked pot to relieve my stress.</p>
<p>But I quitted smoking recently for other reasons, my point is he assumes weed brings stress but someone who actually smoked it such as myself can say otherwise.</p>
<p>So he shouldn’t post fake facts.</p>

<p>provide me with an conclusive article that has a scientific backing/peer review that directly supports your claim.<br>

on the flip side, there are no conclusive articles, with a scientific backing that shows that marijuana causes depression. my reply was more of a bait than anything.</p>

<p>How does it treat depression? It makes you giggle for 15 minutes and then you collapse onto the couch and eat for the next 40.[/quote]<br>

Weed just makes you lazy.  It’s minor when treating depression, cause being high is like being on a rollercoaster and you cant look back cause you go up and down every 5 seconds and never remember what you did/thought/said 1 minute ago.</p>
