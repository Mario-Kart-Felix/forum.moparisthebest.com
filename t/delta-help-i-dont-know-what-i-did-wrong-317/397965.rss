    <title>[Delta] Help! I don&#39;t know what i did wrong. [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-help-i-dont-know-what-i-did-wrong-317/397965</link>
    <description>Okay, so I was making a Modzone for my server, and basically all I did was add a object, a case so it would teleport you to a specific location, a command to teleport you, and a shop.  The rest was added to autospawn.cfg and shops.cfg.  However, when I compiled, I get 100 errors! All of which, are things I haven&#39;t even touched and they are all in client.java.  I have no Idea what I did wrong!  I removed the object and the case in hopes of getting it to work, but nothing was fixed when I compiled. I opened it in Eclipse and it showed no errors.  Can somebody tell me what to do? Also, has anybody encountered this before?

Here are some pictures of what I get when I compile:

And there&#39;s a some similar stuff in between them....
Please Help, I will give Rep!</description>

It’s just that when I hear 100 compiling errors, first to mind is bracket is missing.</p>

<p>If it has 100 errors it means that you have missed out on a bracket somewhere. Try looking in all of the files you changed. Hope this helped.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>From what you’ve shown, it looks like case 21 is orphaned, which means it is not in a switch statement.<br>
If you do not understand what I am saying, let me give you an example.<br>
Let’s say we have an integer named “var1”. We can make a switch statement over “var1” that will look like this:</p>
<p>[code]int var1 = 1;</p>
<p>switch(var1){}[/code]</p>
<p>Now, we can make cases in this switch statement, so, for an example. If we want to output text when var1 = 2, we will do this.</p>
<p>[code]int var1 = 1;</p>
<p>switch(var1){<br>
case 2:<br>
System.out.println(“var1 currently equals 2.”);<br>
break;<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p>So, what I’m basically trying to say is, CTRL+F for case 21, and make sure it’s inside a switch statement.</p>
<p>Note: If any other programmers see that my reply was incorrect, please let me know, I’ve been currently coding with C++ and I cannot remember if the logic is different from Java with switch statements. (Even though I’m quite sure they are pretty much identical)</p>

Once it is uploaded right click it and press “Copy image URL”<br>
Then head back to your topic and press Insert Image.<br>
You should have something like this but without space: [img] [img]<br>
In-between that, you paste the URL you copied earlier.<br>
Hope that helps <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
