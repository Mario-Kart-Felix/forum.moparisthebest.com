    <description>-Uses TestScape-

When i log in it doesnt say that but if anyone else tries that happens(I have a large server with tons of stuff I added)
 heres my runserver:

@echo off
java -cp .;./jython.jar server
java -Xmx3000m client

and I also tried adding

java -Xmx5000m characters
java -Xmx5000m savedgames

but it still doesnt help...

I&#39;m trying disk cleanup now to help add some space but does any one know whats wrong?

also how do you do the code thing on forums were your words are in code box

thanks</description>
