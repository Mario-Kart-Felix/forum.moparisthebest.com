    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/removing-doors-and-gates-in-pi/393541</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, im having a little problem with my PI server, im new to all PI servers (might as well learn the basics since everyones crazy about 317 PI) and im trying to delete a door and a gate in my modification of the server. I have tried deleting it with the deleteObject class and doing c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(-1, x, y, l, 10); way threw object spawn with no luck. Im trying to remove a blacksmith door from the home area in my server, any help as to ways you guys have been able to delete doors and or gates in your servers would be greatly appreciated.</description>

              <p>You can’t with the way PI is set up.  :rolleyes:</p>
<p>You can try and take the code from Impact or Miscellania though, it has a door handler that makes it so you can delete doors.</p>
<p>Goodluck.</p>
