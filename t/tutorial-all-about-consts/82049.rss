    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tutorial-all-about-consts/82049</link>
    <description>Me didn&#39;t know Were to post this.


[center][size=20pt][b]Const&#39;s![/b][/size][/center]

[i][b]1. What are const&#39;s?[/b][/i]
Const&#39;s are What people use for &quot;Setups&quot; in there scripts.
Const&#39;s CANNOT Be Changed by the script.
Const&#39;s are very useful for managing things, For example, There are 10 places in a 300 line script were people need to change to fit there character or the script. Wouldn&#39;t it just be easier to have it all on the first few lines of your script?. I Know it would be for me. Const&#39;s Make this possible.


[i][b]2. How would I Implement these?[/b][/i]
These are very easy to implement. 
1.  Okay, We need to script to know were the consts are located.. Right?
Well,
For a script that dose not have includes:
[b]program[/b] Withoutincludes;
[b]const[/b]
String = &#39;String&#39;; [i]//A Few comments about it[/i]
[b]begin[/b]
[b]end.[/b]

For a script that dose have includes:
[b]program[/b] Withincludes;
[i]{.include include/include.scar}[/i]
[b]const[/b]
String = &#39;String&#39;;[i] //A Few comments about it[/i]
[b]begin[/b]
[b]end.[/b]

Okay but now your thinking... I Have my const Set up... But, How do i setup the Strings?

Once again this is VERY Simple.

For example for a simple hello World script. You would have:
[b]program[/b] elloworld;
[b]begin[/b]
WriteLn (&#39;Hello World&#39;);[i]
[b]end.[/b]

But if you were implementing Consts you would put

[b]program[/b] elloworld;
[b]const[/b]
StringName = &#39;Hello World&#39;;[i] //Outputs Hello World [/i]
[b]begin[/b]
WriteLn (StringName);[i]
[b]end.[/b]

You can change &#39;StringName&#39; to whatever you wish. But you must also change it everywere you have put it in the script.
[i]see Fig.1.0.0[/i]


[i][b]3. Conclusion[/b][/i]
So now... What do you think would be a good idea to have in your script?
People Searching and searching for the setup.
Or having 1 Simple area were users input it into?
