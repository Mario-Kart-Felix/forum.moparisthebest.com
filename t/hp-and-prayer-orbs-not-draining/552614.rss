Chances are the IDs the sources are different.<br>
Check your refreshSkill(int i) method in both sources.<br>
Check the IDs of each sendFrame126 method… If some are different, take the ones from the working source and put them in the none-working one.[/quote]</p>
<p>Alrighty! Thank you very much for useful information! Really helps alot.</p>
