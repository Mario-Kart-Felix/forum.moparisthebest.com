    <title>Advanced PF issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/advanced-pf-issues/543097</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve owned multiple servers, port forwarded many times I know how to port forward, however I&#39;m having some rather strange issues this time:

I&#39;m port forwarding via my comcast modem/router (2 in 1) I&#39;ve allowed the port 43594 through the modem and firewall and it says the port it open on canyouseeme, however I still cannot connect to my server.

Only reason I&#39;m using my modem to PF is because when I moved a while back I got a linksys router and I could never even open a port on it. I mean, I logged into it and added the port on it and the firewall just as I have on my modem but for whatever reason the port was never opened when I checked it on sites like canyouseeme.

I&#39;ve often seen people have the same issue of no connection to their server after port forwarding correctly and unblocking it on their firewall, but no solution. I mean, the port is OPEN it makes no sense.. 

I realize this is a rather difficult issue, if you think you can help me please feel free to chat with me on Skype: kaelenyo 
or message me about my TeamViewer info.
Thanks!</description>

Ah okay I’ve got a technicolor tc8305c.<br>
They look like similar models and probably have similar firmware on it. Next time you’re online I’ll see if I can’t get it working with you.</p>

              <p>Hey, what kind of comcast modem/router do you have? I have a 2 in one as well, so I may be able to help.</p>
<p>Make sure to set your IP static in the router, that way you don’t have to worry about changing the IP that’s being forwarded later.</p>
<p>Double check your router and computer firewalls. Chances are your computer firewalls is denying inbound connections. <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">http://canyouseeme.org</a> is not a reliable port tester. It’s usable and can give the correct status sometimes, but not always. I’ve had it show connection timed out and people could connect to my server, and other times where I was in the same boat as you are now.</p>
<p>Double check your port forward settings too. Just in case you put the wrong info in it.</p>
