    <title>Webclient in Linux</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-in-linux/408820</link>
    <description>For some reason, when i try to load a webclient in Ubuntu Linux, It says &quot;Error loading, Please report&quot;
I&#39;m pretty sure, that&#39;s because its trying to download the cache into C:\ , and it cant, Because its Linux.
Is that right? 
Also, Is there an easy way to fix this Without having to go into the client files? Not saying i cant do it, i&#39;m just too lazy :P</description>
