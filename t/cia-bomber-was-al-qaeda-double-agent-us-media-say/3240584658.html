<p>Placing land mines doesn’t make you a terrorist. They place land mines there because they’re resisting American occupation. It’s called resistance, not terrorism. They don’t kill innocent people, they’re killing American soldiers who are there to implement American interests in the country.</p>
<p>I didn’t say US casualties are faked. If you took the time to educate yourself about the war, you would have noticed that it wasn’t the taliban who were behind 9/11 or any other terrorist attack for that matter. It was alqaeda which America blames for 9/11 etc and Alqaeda is a completely different entity from the Taliban.</p>
<p>[quote=“nacional, post:22, topic:324058”]I guess the bad people is a matter of perspective I guess yours just happen to be<br>

Again, you’re calling the Taliban terrorists yet you have absolutely no idea why you’re calling them terrorists. You know absolutely nothing about the ‘war on terror’ yet you’re making comments on it. Your statements are ridiculous, please don’t baffle any further until you’ve gained sufficient knowledge to make a decent response.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where did I say taliban?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This whole thread is about the CIA bomber that attacked CIA agents in <span class="bbcode-b">Afghanistan</span>. The war in Afghanistan is a war against the Taliban. So this whole time we’re talking about the Taliban and then all of a sudden your asking where did you mention the Taliban?</p>
<p>[quote=“nacional, post:24, topic:324058”]What are this American interests ? besides America’s interests in stopping stuff like<br>
9/11, christmas failed bomb attempt, and Al-Qaeda double agents killing people?[/quote]<br>
The Taliban offered to prosecute Osama bin Laden before the American invasion of Afghanistan, but despite that America insisted in attacking Afghanistan. So obviously it wasn’t in America’s interest to seek justice for their people after the 9/11 attacks, there must have been some other reason for them to attack Afghanistan. Furthermore, neither Afghanistan nor the Taliban represent Alqaeda therefore a war on them isn’t a war on terrorism. This contradicts your argument that America is trying to prevent events like 9/11 or the failed Christmas bomb attempt.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know what America’s interest in Afghanistan is, but I think it’s clear that it’s nothing related to 9/11.</p>
<p>The most ridiculous part of your argument is that for some reason you think America is in Afghanistan because it wants to prevent ‘Al-Qaeda double agents killing people’. I don’t know what level of intelligence it takes to realize this, but the sole reason that this ‘Al-Qaeda double agent’ killed those CIA agents was because of the war. So how on Earth did you even come to the thought that America went to war to prevent this?</p>
<p>You sound like you’re under the influence of some sort of drug that might have compromised your intelligence level to such an extent that you are no longer able to think logically.</p>
<p>Let me reiterate, America claims this war is against Alqaeda. Alqaeda no longer operates in Afghanistan and so the war over there isn’t directed at Alqaeda. It is directed at the Taliban who certainly didn’t participate in a single attack on American soil.</p>
<p>You mentioned 9/11 and the ‘christmas failed bomb attempt’, two events that have absolutely nothing to do with the Taliban.</p>
<p>[quote=“nacional, post:24, topic:324058”]Also I don’t doubt innocent people are killed , it’s a war please point out a war in history<br>
with no civilian casualties.[/quote]<br>
So when America kills innocents it’s a war, yet when Alqaeda kills innocents it becomes a terrorist attack? Again your reasoning is nothing but ridiculous.</p>

<p>Really, the whole point of us being in the middle east is because supposedly 9/11 was linked to Taliban members, which at the time were being funded by Osama bin laden. If this is not the case then i see no point in us being here, but i do find it a coincidence that most of these attackers (not just 9/11) were not born here and were all Muslim. If you say we’re there for oil you’re an idiot.</p>

<p>I didn’t say that was the only reason. What I meant was that you’d have to be a complete idiot to think that the war had anything to do with preventing double agents. The only reason there was a double agent in the first place was because of this war.</p>

You just contradicted yourself there matey. First you ask me to prove that Alqaeda doesn’t operate in Afghanistan, then you go on to state that ‘the current mission as stated by Obama is to prevent Taliban take over’. You just proved it for yourself.</p>
<p>[quote=“nacional, post:32, topic:324058”]as this is what the taliban do, they take advantage of weak governments, recruit there children and give them<br>

Where on earth did the Taliban ‘take advantage of weak governments’? The Taliban was the legitimate government of Afghanistan up until the USA decided they shouldn’t be. Never did the Taliban intervene with any foreign governments.</p>
<p>My favorite part of your argument was that somehow you think our debate has anything to do with Yemen. This time round I wasn’t surprised because I am now accustomed to your absurd reasoning. Let me make this clear, whatever is happening in Yemen has nothing at all to do with the Taliban. They are completely different people who speak a different language and are in different countries. To even relate the two situations just sounds ridiculous.</p>
<p>You claim that the Taliban ‘recruit there children and give them aks and kill people don’t share there radical views’. This statement doesn’t even deserve a response. So instead, I’m going to ask you to provide me with a single incident where anything close to this ever happened in the history of Afghanistan’s existence.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, it was the USA that recruited Afghanis and gave them AK’s to kill anyone that doesn’t share their view of how Afghanistan should be governed.</p>

If this is not the case then i see no point in us being here, but i do find it a coincidence that most of these attackers (not just 9/11) were not born here and were all Muslim. If you say we’re there for oil you’re an idiot.[/quote]<br>
Can you please provide us with a source for this?</p>
<p>Most of the attackers (As you claim) are Muslims most probably because America has been relentlessly oppressing Muslims, both directly and indirectly, for decades now. I’m not saying what they’re doing is right, but they’re obviously doing it for a reason.</p>

<p>There were many other attacks before 9/11 that were linked to the middle east, specifically the Taliban which at the time we had no clue was being funded by Saddam. During the cold war(?) i think it was, we gave saddam missiles for some odd reason i dont remember. So Bush filed a UN wachamacallite, and Saddam did not respond to all 17 that were sent, and didnt allow the inspectors to come into the country to check for missiles. So at the time we went over there to get these missiles back, not because we thought they’d shoot short ranged missiles over to the US(lol), its because we had oil rigs near, and if saddam used the missiles to destroy those oil rigs our economy would have been destroyed.</p>

<p>“So why dont you stop stealing every other countries oil?”</p>
<p>Because democrats wont let us drill on our own soil, yet there telling us to stop depending on foreign oil(or get off oil all together, which i agree with). But we wont run out, theres so much oil in our country it will last us at least 100 years. And im sure by then we will discover an alternative.</p>

<p>“So why dont you stop stealing every other countries oil?”</p>
<p>Because democrats wont let us drill on our own soil, yet there telling us to stop depending on foreign oil(or get off oil all together, which i agree with). But we wont run out, theres so much oil in our country it will last us at least 100 years. And im sure by then we will discover an alternative.[/quote]<br>
The links you provided talk about an incident where passports thought to be linked to 9/11 were found in <span class="bbcode-b">Pakistan</span>. This war we’re talking about is in Afghanistan and not Pakistan. The source of confusion here is the Taliban. The Taliban talked about in the article isn’t the Taliban that’s in Afghanistan. The people of the Pakistani tribal areas were influenced by the Taliban and decided that they will also call themselves Taliban(probably something to do with the literal meaning of the word), but they are definitely not the same group. Even so, the Pakistan Taliban was formed in 2002 - long after 9/11.</p>
<p>Pakistan Taliban: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Taliban" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Taliban</a><br>
Afghanistan Taliban: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban</a></p>
<p>‘There were many other attacks before 9/11 that were linked to the middle east, specifically the Taliban’<br>
Wrong. The Afghan Taliban weren’t involved in any attacks outside Afghanistan at all. So please provide a source for your argument and be sure not to confuse the Pakistan Taliban with the Afghan Taliban.</p>
<p>This debate isn’t really about Iraq but nevertheless your wrong about something. Saddam did allow UN weapons inspectors into Iraq, they were there before the war and they found nothing.</p>

Earlier on you said:<br>
‘If you say we’re there for oil you’re an idiot’<br>
I think that contradicts this post? Correct me if I’m wrong, unless of course it was just the case of you changing your mind.</p>
