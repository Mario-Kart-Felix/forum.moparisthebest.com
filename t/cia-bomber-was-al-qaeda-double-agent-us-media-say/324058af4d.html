With that said, no, I don’t agree with people trying to make their religion more pervasive by challenging social norms in certain countries. For example, I don’t believe that the Burka should be worn in Australia.<br>
HOWEVER, I sure as hell don’t think the catholics had the right to do this either.<br>
If I had my way there wouldn’t be Catholics and Protestants, Sunnis and Shi’ites. It’s backwards and doesn’t belong in this day and age. Neither of them do.[/quote]<br>
Maybe you don’t agree with the burka, but do you think you have the right to say what women should and shouldn’t wear? A lot of the criticism against the burka is based on women being able to wear what they like. But banning the burka defeats the purpose of allowing women to wear what they like - in fact it’s the complete opposite. Effectively, banning the burka is only preventing women from wearing what they like. What most critics don’t realize is that most if not all the women who wear the burka do it because they want to. If you’re arguing under the pretext that ‘women should be free to wear what they like’ then women should be free to wear what they like - including the burka.<br>
[/quote]In Sweden this is slightly different though. We have laws aganist covering your face in public areas, which are pretty much useless thesedays because followers of Islam are still allowed to have their Burka’s without any arrests etc.[/quote]<br>
Same laws exist here. For example, motorcyclists can’t walk into a bank or shopping centre without removing their helmet.<br>
I’m not sure what our situation is with the burka in places like banks, because I’ve never been in a bank with a person wearing one to witness the response.</p>

        <p>[quote=“MujaheD, post:76, topic:324058”]Now initially I was planning to demonstrate, one by one, how the articles Frell posted are irrelevant to the topic we’re discussing. Most of them concern the Pakistani Taliban (A different organization in a different country). The rest aren’t any more relevant either. I’ve now changed my mind because I think it’s clear to everyone that Frell doesn’t know what he’s talking about. If anyone wants any clarification about any particular article, please feel free to pm me.</p>
<p>To add to that, Frell’s thoughts and perceptions are compromised because Frell is racist towards middle-easterners (For this reason I’m sure he’s never met anyone from the middle east). Just to prove it for you guys, here’s a few of the things he said:</p>
<p>[quote author=Frell link=topic=420461.msg3105751#msg3105751 date=1264120034]<br>
‘You’re kidding yourself if you think the Middle Eastern countries are anything but infested with sick, twisted, evil terrorists who hide in hospitals and children’s schools’</p>
<p>‘sick cowards have signed and sworn to a manifesto that says all “infidels” must die’</p>
<p>‘They lie, sneak, cheat…there is nothing redeeming about their character’</p>
<p>‘they would kill everyone on the planet who doesn’t agree with them’</p>
<p>‘Those scumbags have been living and acting like animals for thousands of years.  And all they’ve done is remain in the stone-ages with their twisted logic.’</p>
<p>‘Those sickos will cut your head off.’[/quote]<br>
Frell I think you should apologize for that.[/quote]<br>
No no no, that was not meant towards the population of the middle east or civilians. I mean the way these terrorist organizations act to get what they want is animal like etc.</p>

Yeah but you can’t hide the fact that you’re actually robbing the bank (It’s not like you’re going to be robbing it without anyone realizing). So it’s just the same if you wear a balaclava.</p>
