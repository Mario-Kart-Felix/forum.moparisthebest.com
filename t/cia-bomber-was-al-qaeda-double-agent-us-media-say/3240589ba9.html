<p>Why would USA let the Taliban trial a terrorist whose attack was on US soil, It’s nothing<br>
radical it’s extradition.</p>
<p>Your defense of why troops shouldn’t be in afghanistan is because al-qaeda isn’t there anymore<br>
so show your source.  Then I told you the current reason US is there is not to stop al-Qaeda.</p>

<blockquote>Resolution 1441 gave Iraq "a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations" and set up inspections by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Hussein accepted the resolution on November 13 and inspectors returned to Iraq under the direction of UNMOVIC chairman Hans Blix and IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei. As of February 2003, the IAEA "found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons programme in Iraq"; the IAEA concluded that certain items which could have been used in nuclear enrichment centrifuges, such as aluminum tubes, were in fact intended for other uses.[42] UNMOVIC "did not find evidence of the continuation or resumption of programmes of weapons of mass destruction" or significant quantities of proscribed items. UNMOVIC did supervise the destruction of a small number of empty chemical rocket warheads, 50 liters of mustard gas that had been declared by Iraq and sealed by UNSCOM in 1998, and laboratory quantities of a mustard gas precursor, along with about 50 Al-Samoud missiles of a design that Iraq claimed did not exceed the permitted 150 km range, but which had travelled up to 183 km in tests.</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know where you were during the invasion, but I remember clearly that there were inspections prior to the war.</p>

<p>Not at all. It’s much more dangerous now in Iraq than it ever was. The people of Iraq didn’t want you to go there, maybe some minorities who weren’t happy with Saddam but the general population definitely didn’t want America to intervene. Proof of that is the extent and power of the Iraqi resistance. In 2004 province was under completely in the hands of the resistance (except for fallujah). Do you know how big Alanbar is?<br>

The Taliban have a code of honor. They granted OBL asylum there and they’re not going to just give him away to anyone. They also stated that they had no proof of his involvement at their disposal, so they had no reason to hand him over.</p>

So if the US isn’t there to stop Alqaeda (as you claim), then it doesn’t matter anyway. Alqaeda isn’t some massive army, its a small group of men who probably number somewhere around 2000. Why don’t you provide proof that Alqaeda still exists in Afghanistan?</p>

Where isn’t there proof? I seriously sat here and thought for about 5 minutes about if i had misinterpreted your statement.</p>
<p>I looked up the whole not allowing inspectors in, and it turns out they did. But with restricted access. If they didnt have restricted access he kicked them out right when they got off the plane. Saddam would only allow them to see what he wanted them to see.</p>
<p>Im extremely sorry. This whole time i had Alqaeda and the Taliban mixed up. Meaning 9/11 was linked to Alqaeda. But Alqaeda and the Taliban share recources, information, and training. They opiate drugs to free countries for money for new weapons, which is why we use daisy cutters(bomb) to destroy these fields. They also run false charities and steal money.</p>
<p>Its not that the iraqi population doesn’t support us, its that they’re afraid we will leave. If the terrorists watching them (posing as civilians) see them show support for the US, they will bomb their house, rape their children and put their family in harms way. The major reason they show no support is because if we leave they would be screwed. If someone protects you from a bully, and you go cussing out the bully about how you have a body guard and then your guard leaves, you’re screwed.</p>
<p>You’re a kurd? Now it makes since. Your family was probably to afraid to fight what seemed impossible, so they ran to Australia. You really dont see people escaping the US or Britain etc. So why are you defending what your family ran from?</p>
<p>My father’s a college professor and i came down stairs to show him this post. He sat there shaking his head, doing a major facepalm and was wondering where you’re getting all of this from.</p>
<p>Protip: You’re not supposed to use wikipedia as a source.</p>

<p>You didn’t even know there was a difference between Alqaeda and the Taliban just before, now all of a sudden you have vast knowledge about the Taliban? Why don’t you give me proof of the Taliban ever killing innocents, make sure not to confuse them for the Pakistan Taliban and give me an incident that occurred before the war.</p>
<p>There was an incident where a British journalist was captured by the Taliban, her name was Yvonne Ridley. Eventually they released her and do you know what happened? As a result of the great way the treated her, she converted to Islam. Don’t go telling me that the Taliban go on killing innocents for the fun of it.</p>

</aside>
<p>What do you mean by ‘restricted access’? As far as I’m concerned, they were given all the access they needed. They were so convinced that there were no WMD’s in Iraq that even the head inspector committed suicide after the war started.</p>

<p>Im extremely sorry. This whole time i had Alqaeda and the Taliban mixed up. Meaning 9/11 was linked to Alqaeda. But Alqaeda and the Taliban share recources, information, and training. They opiate drugs to free countries for money for new weapons, which is why we use daisy cutters(bomb) to destroy these fields. They also run false charities and steal money.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>More accurately put, the Taliban allowed alqaeda to run training camps in Afghanistan. As a result of that they probably exchanged information etc. But you’re completely wrong about the drugs. I’ll have you know that the Taliban was the only organization in history that was ever able to cease the drug trade in Afghanistan. After the US removed the Taliban from power, Afghanistan became the supplier of over 90% of the world’s heroin. So to accuse them of even participating in the drug trade is ridiculous.</p>
<p>This accusation of false charities is absurd, please provide a source for this.</p>

<p>Its not that the iraqi population doesn’t support us, its that they’re afraid we will leave. If the terrorists watching them (posing as civilians) see them show support for the US, they will bomb their house, rape their children and put their family in harms way. The major reason they show no support is because if we leave they would be screwed. If someone protects you from a bully, and you go cussing out the bully about how you have a body guard and then your guard leaves, you’re screwed.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Don’t forget that America has attacked Iraq before and America is also the world’s biggest supporter of Israel. Thanks to that, America is the most hated country in the region (after Israel). So don’t go claiming that the Iraqi people love America because that isn’t the case. How do you think the Iraqi people feel about Americans after the Blackwater incident and the infamous Abu Ghraib prison? Trust me the Iraqis don’t stand Americans. Even the puppet government which America set up in Iraq sees it as a great priority that Americans leave Iraq.</p>
<p>That’s funny you said that the Iraqi resistance would for some reason ‘bomb their house, rape their children and put their family in harms way’. The only people to ever do something close to that is the American military. The Americans bombarded Iraq with literally tonnes of explosives (Shock and awe), raped Iraqi women (many times) and definitely put countless Iraqi families into harms way.</p>
<p>It baffles me how anyone could put such accusations against the Iraqi resistance. One of the main reasons the people support the resistance is because they’re frustrated at the American oppression they’re faced with every single day.</p>

<p>As I stated before, this is false.</p>

<p>Protip: You’re not supposed to use wikipedia as a source.[/quote]<br>
You’re right about one thing, wikipedia isn’t a reliable source. I didn’t want to use it as a source but seeing as the point I was trying to prove was common knowledge, I thought what the heck?</p>
<p>Your father facepalming doesn’t mean anything. I assume he is subject to the same conditioning you are, that being the American media.</p>

I was rather offended by that assumption. It only goes to show the extent to which your thoughts and perceptions are influenced by what you see on TV. You’ve got to admit yourself that the Iraqi resistance must be pretty brave to even think about resisting the world’s strongest military.<br>

The Iraqi’s did not want you there you moron - all the Coalition has done is create the Iraqi’s a target in guerrilla warfare because the enemy know troops have families, and can’t kill civilians, so they use them as basically meat shields, and when a civilian is killed in crossfire, that trooper has to live with it.</p>

You didnt offend me at all :P.</p>
<p>Honestly, havent any of you noticed the small band of people on the forums that all agree with each other about this stuff? And im usually the only one to argue about it? Its because im the only one who had time for it. That band of people are so misinformed its not worth the time, and i had the time. All the people i talk to on msn (not ignorant moparscapers) all agree with me, but when i say ‘why dont you step in’ they say ‘you cant argue with idiots’. But someone being wrong bugs me  :P.</p>
<p>I knew the difference between Alqaeda and the Taliban, i had them ‘mixed up’, Meaning everything that alqaeda did (like 9/11) i thought the Taliban did. And i honestly didn’t know there were 2 types of Taliban. So i guess the one im talking about is the bad one. :rolleyes:</p>
<p>I never said they ‘loved America’ but if they showed support they could get hurt.</p>
<p>How was i wrong about the drugs? Thats one of their sources of money.</p>
<p>Where have you learned all of this from? I honestly want to know where you are pulling this stuff from. I’ve argued with many people and all of their arguments made alot more sense than yours. Its nothing i’ve ever seen before. So yes, if you could provide a source to all of this stuff? Anyone could find my argument by googling for a second, but im curious about yours.</p>

I reread my post and as far as I’m concerned, every single point I have made is correct. If anyone has any doubts about any of the points in particular, I’ll be more than happy to find a source for it. Otherwise I don’t really have the time right now to hunt down a source for every single point I’ve made.</p>
<p>Good debating with you Frell, I hope I didn’t offend you at any point. If so, I apologize.<br>
[/quote]<br>
You didnt offend me at all :P.</p>
<p>Honestly, havent any of you noticed the small band of people on the forums that all agree with each other about this stuff? And im usually the only one to argue about it? Its because im the only one who had time for it. That band of people are so misinformed its not worth the time, and i had the time. All the people i talk to on msn (not ignorant moparscapers) all agree with me, but when i say ‘why dont you step in’ they say ‘you cant argue with idiots’. But someone being wrong bugs me  :P.</p>
<p>I knew the difference between Alqaeda and the Taliban, i had them ‘mixed up’, Meaning everything that alqaeda did (like 9/11) i thought the Taliban did. And i honestly didn’t know there were 2 types of Taliban. So i guess the one im talking about is the bad one. :rolleyes:</p>
<p>I never said they ‘loved America’ but if they showed support they could get hurt.</p>
<p>How was i wrong about the drugs? Thats one of their sources of money.</p>
<p>Where have you learned all of this from? I honestly want to know where you are pulling this stuff from. I’ve argued with many people and all of their arguments made alot more sense than yours. Its nothing i’ve ever seen before. So yes, if you could provide a source to all of this stuff? Anyone could find my argument by googling for a second, but im curious about yours.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ok I’m almost half asleep so I’ll post as many as I can here now. If there’s anything I missed, you’ll have to wait for tomorrow.</p>

They also accused the Iraqi resistance of the crime. There were also numerous other accounts and a rough google search should lead you to many incidents.

<p>Frell, I’m a reasonable person. I acknowledge that I can be wrong at times, and if I was ever wrong in this debate, please point it out. I’m not going to lash out at you or diverge from the subject.</p>

        <p>Well honestly im not a debater about wars, but i tried. For all we know people from the middle east have been attacking us and we needed to stop it. Anything really after that is beyond me. Many people join the US military because they just want to hold a gun etc, and im not really sure why we let people that that into our military that do things like rape 14 year old girls. Or anyone for that matter. We were there just to help get their governments back on their feet so they could fend off terrorists, as we held elections and people got into office they would be murdered. Here they say the Taliban(whatever one is bad) wants control of these governments so they can make everyone believe what they believe. And basically if you don’t you’re pretty much the enemy.</p>
<p>If they want us to leave so bad then we did, things would probably go back to countless bombings and riots until the Taliban ultimately got control of Iraq. And we would leave this to be their business if attacks didn’t happen on our own soil, we don’t just step into a conflict and try to settle it.</p>
<p>I do agree that we have gone a little off of our main goal, but in 2003 we went in first to find Saddam and the missiles, then to the Alqaeda. But in some way the Taliban(The bad ones) were posing as a threat to these week structured governments. So we decided to try to help them build infrastructure (and im sure the officials agreed, we couldnt force them into this).</p>
<p>Just re-read what i said ^^ and everythings pretty jumbled up (order wise), but i cba to fix it.</p>

This post proves how little knowledge you have of the conflict. Really Frell, you have no right to discuss this topic with the little knowledge you have of it.</p>
<p>I really didn’t think you could put so much falsehood in a single post. I mean come on, did you seriously relate the Taliban to Iraq? I really thought you knew better… To avoid you anymore embarrassment, I will not respond to that post.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Frell, post:58, topic:324058”]Well our government is spending billions of dollars and lives over there trying to help those people be free, if your argument was true then why would we waste all that money? This is in no way an act of imperialism either.</p>
<p>And yes, we gave Saddam missiles during the gulf war. We went there after he didnt allow the inspectors to see them, knowing if he destroyed our oil rigs it would destroy our economy. After Saddam was hanged our main focus afterwords was the alqaeda. The Iraq government accepted our offer to help them train and thats mainly what we are there for now. Trying to keep the ‘WHOEVER KEEPS SUICIDE BOMBING HERE’ out while we train them.</p>
<p>Tell me how you think this entire war went down.[/quote]<br>
Yeah the missiles are no secret. The Iraqis even modified them so they were capable of longer ranges. In fact they did fire a few at Israel. But that’s definitely not an excuse to go to war, or set up a government which operates according to American interests. I honestly don’t think the whole war was over a few missiles. A problem like that could have easily been solved with a few cruise missiles. America obviously had some other interests in mind.</p>
<p>Effectively, America think it’s the world police.</p>
<p>This has got to be the most ridiculous statement I’ve ever heard:<br>
‘knowing if he destroyed our oil rigs it would destroy our economy’<br>
Firstly, how on earth does America have any oil rigs in the region at all? And secondly, how would the destruction of oil rigs supposedly destroy your economy? That’s ridiculous. Do you have any idea how many times the resistance attacked the puppet government’s oil rigs? Yet they still seem to be doing quite well, economically speaking.</p>
<p>Oh and just in case you didn’t know, there were no suicide bombings in Iraq prior to the war.</p>
<p>Didn’t niall promise he’d respond to this thread at some point?</p>
