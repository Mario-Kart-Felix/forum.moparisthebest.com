&#39;According to Western intelligence officials quoted in the reports, Humam al-Balawi called his handlers last week to arrange a meeting at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, where he said he would relay urgent information about Zawahiri.

Once inside the base, the reports say, he blew himself up killing seven CIA employees and his handler, whom Jordanian media have named as Ali bin Zeid.&#39;

Maybe you don’t agree with the burka, but do you think you have the right to say what women should and shouldn’t wear? A lot of the criticism against the burka is based on women being able to wear what they like. But banning the burka defeats the purpose of allowing women to wear what they like - in fact it’s the complete opposite. Effectively, banning the burka is only preventing women from wearing what they like. What most critics don’t realize is that most if not all the women who wear the burka do it because they want to. If you’re arguing under the pretext that ‘women should be free to wear what they like’ then women should be free to wear what they like - including the burka.<br>

Yeah but you can’t hide the fact that you’re actually robbing the bank (It’s not like you’re going to be robbing it without anyone realizing). So it’s just the same if you wear a balaclava.</p>

              <p>[quote=“MujaheD, post:76, topic:324058”]Now initially I was planning to demonstrate, one by one, how the articles Frell posted are irrelevant to the topic we’re discussing. Most of them concern the Pakistani Taliban (A different organization in a different country). The rest aren’t any more relevant either. I’ve now changed my mind because I think it’s clear to everyone that Frell doesn’t know what he’s talking about. If anyone wants any clarification about any particular article, please feel free to pm me.</p>
<p>To add to that, Frell’s thoughts and perceptions are compromised because Frell is racist towards middle-easterners (For this reason I’m sure he’s never met anyone from the middle east). Just to prove it for you guys, here’s a few of the things he said:</p>
<p>[quote author=Frell link=topic=420461.msg3105751#msg3105751 date=1264120034]<br>
‘You’re kidding yourself if you think the Middle Eastern countries are anything but infested with sick, twisted, evil terrorists who hide in hospitals and children’s schools’</p>
<p>‘sick cowards have signed and sworn to a manifesto that says all “infidels” must die’</p>
<p>‘They lie, sneak, cheat…there is nothing redeeming about their character’</p>
<p>‘they would kill everyone on the planet who doesn’t agree with them’</p>
<p>‘Those scumbags have been living and acting like animals for thousands of years.  And all they’ve done is remain in the stone-ages with their twisted logic.’</p>
<p>‘Those sickos will cut your head off.’[/quote]<br>
Frell I think you should apologize for that.[/quote]<br>
No no no, that was not meant towards the population of the middle east or civilians. I mean the way these terrorist organizations act to get what they want is animal like etc.</p>

              <p>It’s probably worth pointing out that Western society is only a few centuries ahead of Eastern society, if that, when it comes to their practice of religion. And I don’t mean to say that in a scathing manner.</p>
<p>Honestly, it wasn’t so long ago that women accused of being witches were thrown into water and left to die; those that floated were witches, those that sank and drowned were proven innocent.<br>
That, and the catholic church used to rule the roost.</p>
<p>With that said, no, I don’t agree with people trying to make their religion more pervasive by challenging social norms in certain countries. For example, I don’t believe that the Burka should be worn in Australia.<br>
HOWEVER, I sure as hell don’t think the catholics had the right to do this either.<br>
If I had my way there wouldn’t be Catholics and Protestants, Sunnis and Shi’ites. It’s backwards and doesn’t belong in this day and age. Neither of them do.</p>

              <p>Now initially I was planning to demonstrate, one by one, how the articles Frell posted are irrelevant to the topic we’re discussing. Most of them concern the Pakistani Taliban (A different organization in a different country). The rest aren’t any more relevant either. I’ve now changed my mind because I think it’s clear to everyone that Frell doesn’t know what he’s talking about. If anyone wants any clarification about any particular article, please feel free to pm me.</p>
<p>To add to that, Frell’s thoughts and perceptions are compromised because Frell is racist towards middle-easterners (For this reason I’m sure he’s never met anyone from the middle east). Just to prove it for you guys, here’s a few of the things he said:</p>
<p>[quote=“Frell, post:61, topic:324058”]‘You’re kidding yourself if you think the Middle Eastern countries are anything but infested with sick, twisted, evil terrorists who hide in hospitals and children’s schools’</p>
<p>‘sick cowards have signed and sworn to a manifesto that says all “infidels” must die’</p>
<p>‘They lie, sneak, cheat…there is nothing redeeming about their character’</p>
<p>‘they would kill everyone on the planet who doesn’t agree with them’</p>
<p>‘Those scumbags have been living and acting like animals for thousands of years.  And all they’ve done is remain in the stone-ages with their twisted logic.’</p>
<p>‘Those sickos will cut your head off.’[/quote]<br>
Frell I think you should apologize for that.</p>

First thing that came to mind when Yz said ‘Air raids’.</p>
<p>Plus, i also love how people prey on 1 silly mistake, when they never take into account the hundreds that go correctly. We have laser guided missiles that can practically hit a golf ball from outer space. And satellite drones constantly watching these places, along with CIA agents on the ground trakcing information and following these suspects.</p>

<p>You have a go about the Taliban killing innocents; what about the USAF’s fucking air raids which kill 1000’s of civilians to kill a few insurgents everyday? Put it into perspective, please.

</aside>
<p>That doesn’t happen as often as you think, all you may see is the final strike they do from the AC130. Before this we have people watching the buildings day and night for activity, its a big decision dropping a bomb on an area that is so urban and practically a city. We don’t fly over like Nazis and drop bombs for days.</p>
<p>MujaheD replied to me saying the “Taliban sold opium for money and cut fingers off voters and bombed schools” by saying thats “sick minded for me to even <span class="bbcode-b">think</span> that” when its no lie that they do actually do this stuff.</p>
<p>Not to mention the bodies you see in the pictures above are usually insurgents. They hide in buildings and take shots at us and plant road bombs, then we finally infiltrate the building and kill them and strip them naked to make sure theres no traces of explosives on them. And as you can see we have patched him up and are trying to restrain him.</p>

<p>These “brave men” also shot themselves in their calves, legs, arms, etc just to get out that place and lead a normal life again and regret even joining the army.<br>
Most of your soldiers return to their country only to be er great depression, anger problems etc.<br>
They live their lives in war, come back, die at home.<br>
I think these soldiers regret getting involved in such tyranny as much as everyone does.<br>
You might realise it later, but this war was never in “world interests” or to commit the world against “war against terrorism”.<br>
If USA had supposedly other reasons to enter Iraq, why did it want to justify it’s actions by accusing Iraq to have WMDs? Why was Dr Kelly apparently murdered?</p>

Ah thanks.</p>
<p>ps has Australia committed any war-crimes in the war on terror? I don’t think we ever really commit them, to be honest. Last one which springs to mind was the Boer War when some guy from the Light Horse was executed by the British regiment because he assassinated someone, even though he was following orders. Can someone find a link for that? I’m curious to have a read about that now.[/quote]Never really heard about that story before, maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boer_war" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boer_war</a> But I really can’t recall any war crimes at the hands of Australian soldiers.</p>
<p>Frell, instead of implementing the knowledge which I hope you’ve gained from my posts, you chose to pursue in mimicking the bullshit you hear on TV. I think it’s really obvious that your perspective on ‘middle easterners’ is extremely distorted to the extent that you think Middle Eastern countries are ‘infested with sick, twisted, evil terrorists who hide in hospitals and children’s schools’. What kind of a sick mind would you have to have to even think that? How dare you call those who resist the Americans cowards? If anything, they are the most brave men on the planet for resisting the world’s strongest military…</p>
<p>Your so quick to condemn Saddam’s regime yet you turn a blind eye to the sick minded criminals that run Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo bay. Those sick bastards are responsible for for torturing and murdering Iraqis which I’m sure would now prefer Saddam’s regime. Let’s take a look at how Americans propagate this wonderful freedom of theirs:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.worldproutassembly.org/images/guantanamo-21.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><img src="http://www.spencersundell.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/abu-ghraib_bloody-knee.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><img src="http://ch.indymedia.org/images/2004/05/22916.jpg" alt width="530" height="411"></p>
<p>These are the people whom you speak so highly of. I can tell from the photos how desperate they are in spreading American style freedom to the middle east.</p>
<p>Your claims are baseless and outright ridiculous. You echo the lies you hear like a parrot, it seems you didn’t even stop to think for yourself and even wonder if they’re true.</p>
<p>‘sworn to a manifesto that says all “infidels” must die’</p>
<p>Where’s your proof of this? This is what American generals tell their soldiers to deceive them and make them think that somehow the Iraqis posed some sort of threat to America.</p>
<p>It bewilders me, your claim that Israel has ‘bent over backwards to kiss the butt of radical Muslims’. The Israeli’s don’t compromise, evidence of that is in their ruthless bombing of Palestine and Lebanon. Israelis don’t hesitate when it comes to the murder of children or even babies. They think they have the god given right to kill anyone. What’s funny is they’ve convinced you Americans that they’re being oppressed. They prey on you and they have your entire military at their disposal. An American president can’t be elected president without approval of the Zionist Jewish lobby AIPAC.</p>
<p>This is what Israeli interests involve:<br>
<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/61/210051023_ab3fa65015_o.jpg" alt width="550" height="367"></p>
<p>Although you’ve repeatedly denied that oil had anything to do with US motives in Iraq, you seem to have changed your mind. Honestly you have no idea what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Keep echoing the thought that Muslims think ‘all “infidels” must die’. This is what ultimately will lead to the down fall of America.</p>
<p>You’re right about one thing, ‘We have better things on which to spend our money and lives’.<br>
There are plenty of other good things you could do with your money, but instead you choose to spend trillions of dollars on fighting an already lost war.</p>
<p>4374 lost their lives in Iraq and 31616 have been wounded in a war which, just like you, they probably can’t even justify (source <a href="http://www.icasualties.org/Iraq/index.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.icasualties.org/Iraq/index.aspx</a>)</p>
<p>You really seem to think you’re at war with them because ‘Those sickos will cut your head off’. Your only making a fool of yourself, proving the extent to which your thoughts and perceptions are influenced by the idiot box in your living room.</p>
<p>You speak so highly of American soldiers as if the only reason they went to war was to spread freedom, democracy and other bullshit American values. The true reason they left is because they’re probably most likely drop-outs who put their lives on the line for a good salary. The state of America is so fucked up that a military life is convenient for most of the population.</p>
<p>That video you posted of an American soldier saving an Iraqi is complete bullshit. Whoever that man was, he’s lying to the audience just so that they could feel good about themselves sending their children to die. It’s impossible that there was a single Iraqi soldier on America’s side at the time when there was still republican guards ambushing Americans. The puppet Iraqi army was only ever established after America defeated Saddam’s army.</p>
<p>To reiterate, you have no idea what you’re talking about. You posted articles about the Taliban attacking the US imposed Afghan government. How on earth does that portray them as evil or bad when they’re fighting a government that claims ownership of their land?</p>
<p>In summary, you’re an idiot and you keep defending the war not because it seems logical to you, rather for some other reason which I don’t seem to understand.</p>
<p>Edit: Frell are you 15?</p>

You know darn well here were umpteen UN resolutions directing him to live up to his OWN agreements after the first gulf war when we had to drive him out of Kuwait.  You know why we had to do it?  Because there is no world police to right the wrong of a bully.  Not to mention, he wanted to control the flow of oil to the world.  I wouldn’t have trusted him for anything.  We know about the sick torturing that he and his sick sons inflicted on poor, innocent people who objected to his tyranny.  And if you had to endure bombs being lobbed in to your home town you would want someone to help you too.  The Israelis have bent over backwards to kiss the butt of radical Muslims, but there is no pacifying them.  You know why?  Because the sick cowards have signed and sworn to a manifesto that says all “infidels” must die.  Why?  Hypocrites?!  They demand their freedom to practice their religion while depriving anyone else of there rights.   They lie, sneak, cheat…there is nothing redeeming about their character.</p>
<p>The oil fields, do affect our economy and many others around the world—why do you think the whole subject of oil is so important?  The whole world runs on oil; oil is in nearly all products to include plastics and clothes.   The world cannot afford to have knuckle-head morons in charge of oil or anything nuclear, because they’re sick.  Moreover, they would not be a “good” force in the world—they would kill everyone on the planet who doesn’t agree with them—too include terrorist candidates such as yourself.</p>
<p>But for the Middle East, the entire world would be pretty much at peace.  Don’t blame America.  Those scumbags have been living and acting like animals for thousands of years.  And all they’ve done is remain in the stone-ages with their twisted logic.  And we can’t count on the United Nations or NATO to do squat because they’re gutless and capitulation like all liberals do.  Moreover, many members of those organizations seek to cripple Western countries because Europe has so badly botched up their governments over and over.  If America is so bad and stupid and everyone else is so smart, why does anyone with a brain risk their life to come to this country?  I don’t see Americans trying to escape America to go to Iraq or Afghanistan.  We don’t WANT to be there.  And as soon as those clowns get their act together, we’ll be happy to leave.  We have better things on which to spend our money and lives.</p>
<p>You sympathize all you want.  But you don’t have the guts to do what brave Americans, British, and Australians have done for rest of the world.  If you think the Taliban are so loving and peaceful, go over there and see how lovely it is.  See what kind education and treatment your daughter gets.  See how your wife is treated.  And see what happens to you if you disagree with them.   Those sickos will cut your head off.  Real loving and peaceful people.  You sir, are gullible and uninformed.  Frankly, I’m wasting my time.</p>
<p>You should be on your knees thanking GOD (or someone) for what these armies have done for you and your family.  Go in the military and learn to be man.   Don’t bother responding because I’m done with this conversation unless you have something positive to say.</p>

<p>If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known, that we are at all times ready for War.  –  George Washington</p>
