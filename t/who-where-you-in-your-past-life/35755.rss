    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/who-where-you-in-your-past-life/35755</link>
    <description>To know the answer, just type in the date when you were born in your present life. 

http://www.thebigview.com/pastlife/

[b]For example: 
October 3rd, 1955 would be entered as 
Day: 3, Month: 10, Year: 1955[/b] 

 :eek:

Mine was...
Your past life diagnosis:
I don&#39;t know how you feel about it, but you were female in your last earthly incarnation.You were born somewhere in the territory of modern West Australia around the year 900. Your profession was that of a monk (nun), bee-keeper or lone gunman.
Your brief psychological profile in your past life:
Inquisitive, inventive, you liked to get to the very bottom of things and to rummage in books. Talent for drama, natural born actor.
The lesson that your last past life brought to your present incarnation:
There is an invisible connection between the material and the spiritual world. Your lesson is to search, find and use this magical bridge.
Do you remember now?
To clarifiy...I&#39;m a bit &quot;Weirded out&quot; about this...It seems exactly like me.</description>

Bohemian personality, mysterious, highly gifted, capable to understand ancient books. With a magician’s abilities, you could have been a servant of dark forces. The lesson that your last past life brought to your present incarnation:<br>
Your task is to learn, to love and to trust the universe. You are bound to think, study, reflect, and to develop inner wisdom.</p>

Revolutionary type. You inspired changes in any sphere - politics, business, religion, housekeeping. You could have been a leader. The lesson that your last past life brought to your present incarnation:<br>
Your lesson is to learn humility and faith in spiritual principles. You should believe in higher reasons. Do you remember now?</p>
<p>Wow, it actually sounds a good bit like me…Thats oddly strange.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a mental problem, it was actually an STD, that began to affect my brain in the late stages of it. If you’d watched all my black and white films, later on, we began censoring videos of me less and less, because we were starting to lose, and focusing more on the war. You can see my body shaking, and having tremors in quite a few of the later videos due to the disease.</p>
