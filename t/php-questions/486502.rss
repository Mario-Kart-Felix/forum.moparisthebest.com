    <title>PHP Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/php-questions/486502</link>
    <description>So I am making a site script, maybe I&#39;ll use it, maybe I&#39;ll release, idk. It&#39;s a HIGHLY desired script and I think it will be the only one out there. I have always wanted to learn PHP so I will be using this project of mine to learn.

On to my question:

I am in the process of making the registration script, my main aim here is security. I want the form data sent to be sanitized, passwords encrypted, and variables to be secure. Have any &#39;pro tips&#39; on how to do things like this?</description>

That’s insane, I only recently found the jquery.validate plugin, even that’s just a matter of declaring field names and then declare an error message for each, but that’s incredibly easy, thanks for that!  Wasn’t aware HTML5 had the validation sussed already <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<blockquote>The rest is fairly straightforward, just make sure you escape strings when making any communication with the database, use sessions to store the current login (cookies are insecure), and use a secure method of encryption for passwords such as Bcrypt (md5 has been cracked, and I think SHA1 has a vulnerability or two).</blockquote>You need to use cookies to store the session though. Cookies themselves aren't insecure (if your website doesn't have any exploits), storing the username and password in them is though.
<p>SHA1 also hasn’t been cracked, it’s just not meant for password storage. It’s a general hash that computes too quickly so it isn’t ideal for password storage. Same with SHA256, SHA512, or any other similar hash. Bcrypt is slow and can’t be sped up “unfairly” using different hardware (GPUs). This site explains it in more detail: <a href="http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/</a></p>
