RageX isn&#39;t very popular. There isn&#39;t many players due to just getting the word out.
But I look forwards to have a successful private server. Do I want a bunch of players?
No, all I am looking for is about 20-50 players. As long as people are enjoying the
game, I&#39;m happy. 

Hope to see some of you in-game.
Thank you for your time, Happy Gaming.[/b][/CENTER]</description>

<p>-Character invisible in equipment tab<br>
-Shortcut icon not working in Re-sizeable and Fullscreen<br>
-Hitting and being hit seems to have delay, on showing the dealt damage (Noticed this at Rock crabs)<br>
-Most NPCs that should be aggresive, aren’t 100% aggresive. (They will follow you, but not attack you)<br>
-Prayer orb shows 10x your actual prayer points.<br>
-Hill giants seem to have an loading issue, the first time you visit them. (Went there and they where invisble for like 15 seconds, after that they where visible)<br>
-When climbing up some ladders, you end up at random locations instead of the correct one</p>
<p>That’s about it for now, might find more down the road.<br>
<span class="bbcode-s">But for sure Rage-x is a server to play for a while, and have fun together with other players.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for the feedback. Will improve.</p>

RageX isn’t very popular. There isn’t many players due to just getting the word out.<br>
But I look forwards to have a successful private server. Do I want a bunch of players?<br>
No, all I am looking for is about 20-50 players. As long as people are enjoying the<br>
game, I’m happy.</p>
<p>Hope to see some of you in-game.<br>
Thank you for your time, Happy Gaming.[/b][/CENTER]</p>
