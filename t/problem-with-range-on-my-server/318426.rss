    <title>Problem With Range on my server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-range-on-my-server/318426</link>
    <description>Well we had our server up for like 2 weeks now and only just noticed this problem. Training range is fine on monsters goes up how i want it but then as soon as they do ranging in pk areas it puts their defence up as well, i have tested changing range styles, rapid, accurate and long range but it does it for all of them only in pk though, anyone know how to sort it.</description>
