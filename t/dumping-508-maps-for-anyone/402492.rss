    <title>Dumping 508 maps for anyone!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dumping-508-maps-for-anyone/402492</link>
    <description>Hi moparscape, I realize some people may want to add 508 maps and objects to their client, so I&#39;m going to take some requests as I finally figured out how to do it. Some maps I cannot do as they are encrypted with XTEA or something, but if I&#39;m able to dump what you&#39;ve requested, I will certainly upload them for you. So don&#39;t be shy to ask!

Maps I know of that cannot be dumped atm:
Fist of guthix game room :(
dorgeshuun :(

Maps I have dumped, and know can be dumped:
Bounty hunter! :D
Varrock :D

Please supply me with the coordinates of the places you wish, I will dump only 508 maps, nothing higher.

[b]Note:[/b]You can easily preload these maps by adding them into the &quot;maps&quot; folder (thats generally what it&#39;s called)</description>
