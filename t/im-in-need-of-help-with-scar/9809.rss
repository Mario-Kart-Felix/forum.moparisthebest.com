    <title>I&#39;m in need of help with SCAR</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-in-need-of-help-with-scar/9809</link>
    <description>This is the error I get on WhiteShadow&#39;s PowerChopper, and other scripts. I&#39;ve extracted all of the includes to the includes folder, and all and such as said on the tut made by Star.

Include file C:\Program Files\SCAR 2.03\includes\SRL/SRL.Scar does not exist.
Include file C:\Program Files\SCAR 2.03\includes\SRL/SRL/Skill/WoodCutting.Scar does not exist.
Include file C:\Program Files\SCAR 2.03\includes\SRL/SRL/Misc/PlayerForm.Scar does not exist.
Failed when compiling

Could anyone tell me how to fix this and what I need to do..? :confused:
Any help would be MOST appreciated..
Btw, I also tried running the Gull killer, and another power cutter, both of which ended up failing to compile like so ^^. So yeah just leave a post up here telling me what to do to get this fixed, if it can be, or w/e.

Thanks,

<p>Heres what you do, You INSTALL the SRL INCLUDE properly.  SCAR, if you didnt notice, gives nice neat error reports.  “Does not exist”  hmmmm what does that mean?</p>
