    <title>How would i add &quot;M&quot; When trying to withdraw &quot;X Amount of money&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-add-m-when-trying-to-withdraw-x-amount-of-money/448168</link>
    <description>Im trying to add the option 10m for example when you are trying to withdraw money instead of typing all those zero&#39;s.

Is there maybe a guide to do this?

EDIT: SORRY I POSTED IN THE WRONG SECTION, IF YOU WOULD MOVE TO THE HELP SECTION PLEASE.</description>
