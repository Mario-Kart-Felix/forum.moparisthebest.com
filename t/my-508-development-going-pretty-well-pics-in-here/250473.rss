              <p>espeon is a type of server, if you have palidino76 its ok, it just lags alot…</p>
<p>and right click compile all and you will see jdk.6.0_0-11</p>
<p>where it says 0-11 i meant 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11</p>
<p>then change the jdk to your version</p>

              <p>latin, you should try to make trading.</p>
<p>trading wont be hard, you just have to create a few cases stating that it opens first trade screen, and allows inventory space to show.  Then make the players able to put items up, probably with an itemoninterface code.  Then declare the next case for trade screen two and make a button that has except for both screens 1 and 2.</p>
<p>this is really easy, i seen lots of 508’s like this, but it’s not special.</p>
<p>if i see improvement i will rep++</p>
<p>note: i dont rep everyone, just people who i think acually tried.</p>
