              <p>I would hope you would know how to do it xD After 3 years. Linksys is the easiest to port forward tbh. Make sure you use the right port, 43594 and do it in the right section, cause there is also port blocking i think in linksys, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEI0VRAiyrk&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEI0VRAiyrk&amp;feature=related</a> Is a video on how to portforward. Make sure you are using the right ip’s and all that shit.</p>

              <p>Ok for the problem of server you cant get or whatever? Download a server and client. Easiest i would say is a 317, You can find this is the “Server Downloads” section. Secondly getting a no-ip address, you need to go to <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a>, download the client and follow that shit. Google helps if you’re stuck on that. So does youtube. Change the server ip to i think your default gateway and your friends will connect via your actual IP or the no-ip you set up. So you wanna make yourself an admin? If you download a 317 server it will have a folder called “characters” once you have made your character sign out and shut the server off, Go into the “characters” folder and in a notepad file format should be the name of your character, open it up in notepad, Look for the line where it says “character-rights = (number)” change that number to: 1, for mod, 2 for admin, 3 for owner. compile it and run the server and you will be mod/admin/owner. Hope this helped mate, get back to me if you’re still stuck on anything or need further explaining.</p>
<p>LOL Fail. I just read the date of this. july 11th 2008 x.x</p>

Lol he is saying basically<br>
He and his friends want to run a server, but he doesn’t know how. He’s using the moparscape client, and no-ip changer. He wants you to do it for him, or help him, he does not care if you make yourself admin.</p>
<p>Yes i am noob-friendly</p>
