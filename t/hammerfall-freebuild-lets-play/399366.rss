[hr]

Hello, miners! Do you love the Yogscast? Do you wish that you could see characters like Simon &amp; Lewis adventure through towns and cities you have built? Would you like to be a character like Old_Peculier or PirateTinman?

Well look no further!

Introduction:
Hammerfall is a small server that intends to develop a story-based Let&#39;s Play (or LP), similar to the Yogscast. First of all I want to clarify that we are not affiliated with the Yogscast in any way. We simply love their series and believe that working together as a community to create a similar story would be exciting!

What we have planned:
Yogscast follows a specific format... the players build something really neat together behind the scenes, and then the heroes record their adventure through it! We would also follow a similar structure of development... some players would build a town together, and then we would record an episode there! We already have some unique areas planned, we just need people to help in certain jobs...

What jobs?
Specifically, a story-based Let&#39;s Play requires five different types of players:

•Hero

•Builder

•Actor

•Architect

•Narrator

Heroes:
The heroes are the stars of the Let&#39;s Play. Simon and Lewis are examples of heroes. The requirements for being a hero are the highest.

Builder:
The builders are the muscles of the Let&#39;s Play. A builder is responsible for constructing the towns / castles / mazes the heroes will travel through during their adventure.

Actor:
Actors are also important. They help the heroes with quests and can be used to drive the story. Old_Peculier and PirateTinman are examples of actors. Actors only talk using the in game chat.

Architect:
Architects oversee each builder&#39;s construction to ensure the buildings conform to a specific theme. An architect can also be an actor or a builder. An exceptional builder will be bumped up to an architect.

Narrator:
The narrator tells the actors when to start certain events (via private messaging) and make sure the story-driven sections of the Let&#39;s Play end up in the correct order. They also correspond with the architect and tell them what style to follow for each area. An exceptional actor will be bumped up to a narrator.

I want to help!
We would love any help we can get! In order for us to determine feedback on this project, please vote on the poll at the top of the page. Please also read the rules of the server which can be found here. Copy the following sample application format to apply...</description>
