    <title>What happened to Uniqueness?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-happened-to-uniqueness/451439</link>
    <description>I have been browsing server advertisements, seeing if a actual half decent server was released.
I come to this realization:
Most of them are insidiax Leeches.
Most are Matrix leeches.
Its kind of sad.
I do not mean to hate on any servers, but i believe there are hardly any unique servers left.
Thoughts?</description>

              <p>Oh, I assume itll be moved soon, but most of the servers who use them as bases change the message… And there advertisements have the same content. It justs annoys me with the repetition.</p>

<p>However, I do agree but i’ve used both as bases because they are good bases to start with. People have to start somewhere though…</p>

              <p>I have been browsing server advertisements, seeing if a actual half decent server was released.<br>
I come to this realization:<br>
Most of them are insidiax Leeches.<br>
Most are Matrix leeches.<br>
Its kind of sad.<br>
I do not mean to hate on any servers, but i believe there are hardly any unique servers left.<br>
Thoughts?</p>
