    <title>Quality... Doesn&#39;t Matter in RSPS? And O.C.D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quality-doesnt-matter-in-rsps-and-o-c-d/282706</link>
    <description>Well, I was browsing the forums... (&#39;browsing&#39;) And I came across a server advertisement. As different and good as it claimed to be, it was still missing quality. It had those tiny little annoying bugs anyone could fix if they tried, but yet, it failed.

For example. The Dragon Claws &#39;ints&#39; were wrong; too zoomed in, rotated incorrectly, etc... And how much effort can it take to change a number?

Another thing was the FUCKING GOD DAMN INVENTORY SPRITE THAT PISSES ME OFF! In nearly EVERY client used today, the inventory sprite is incorrect. It&#39;s too big and looks terrible.

Let&#39;s not forget the incorrect tab sprites and half-done sprite remakes. In many clients, the tabs used on the right (Like the buttons you click to change the interface) are ripped incorrectly and not properly made transparent. I&#39;ve also noticed that some people use the scroll bar buttons flipped, to save time. How can you not see the incorrect lighting? It looks terrible. Same thing with some of the tabs used on right.

And more with the sprites. Why is it that some people use the new sprites, but have it look like shit with the unfinished minimap/background sprites? Maybe it&#39;s because the minimap because a circle, but if I remember correctly, there&#39;s a tutorial on fixing it.

So, from what I&#39;ve gathered here, people don&#39;t care that their clients look like shit. Some day when I have nothing to do, I&#39;m going to log onto a 508 server and rip the sprites myself and maybe put into a client.


Now, it&#39;s the server complaints. Oh yea. Let&#39;s talk about DeltaScape. There&#39;s many tiny, tiny bugs in there that need fixing. If we all work together, we can fix them one by one :) (or not)

First one. The shopping bugs... When you try to sell an item, chances are, it&#39;ll say something like &quot;You need atleast two open inventory slots to sell that item.&quot; when you don&#39;t. Another one is the classic selling an item with a full inventory :)

When you try to sell an item with a full inventory, you can&#39;t. This fails, because the server should not to [b]any[/b] space checking when selling a non-stackable item. Why? The slot is being freed which makes room for money. I&#39;ve also found that when selling an inventory with money in it, yet no free space, you can&#39;t sell it. That&#39;s just pathetic.

There&#39;s more. Many more. However, I&#39;m not going to sit here and name them all. I&#39;m sure you all know atleast 1 more not mentioned here.


So here&#39;s the part where I get into talking about O.C.D (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder). Personally, I think it really helps when programming because you notice every little detail and you can&#39;t stand it, which is fixing comes to it.

This is why Back to Basics had every bug I could find fixed (Or atleast attempted), because I can&#39;t stand to see things like the reversed scroll bar with improper shading, or the incorrect sprites, or the shopping bugs.


Now that I&#39;ve explained it all, give me your opinions. Does having O.C.D help programmers? Do people really not give a shit about quality anymore? Why?

<p>DeltaScape isn’t always used in cases for people being lazy. For example, Back to Basics used it (I know, I know…). The NPCs, shops, etc… Were totally wiped out, but because of its speed and bugfixes compared to the old ones, I felt like using it. Pretty much every bug I found in it though, was fixed too.</p>
<p>But you know, I don’t blame people here for being lazy. Most people here have just started programming and don’t know shit, and they learn with RSPS (That’s almost where I started :). Started C++ months before that though.)</p>
<p>However, that doesn’t change the fact that people still don’t care about quality in RSPS, but they are lazy for using DeltaScape and barely build off that.</p>

              <p>I’ve had it with private server for now, a lot of the private servers have nothing special, just changed home places and a shitty old client they found over moparscape.</p>
<p>I guess if a big group teamed up with the approval of MITB to make a new “genoration” of private server I guess it could start to change things, otherwise runescape private servers will just be the same, and always will be.</p>

              <p>People don’t care about quality obviously. Otherwise they wouldn’t be using the shit bases they use today. When I owned my server it would bug the living hell out of me if there was a glitch. I would try my hardest to fix it and if I couldn’t I would ask for help.</p>
<p>People are just lazy, they just want to put up their shit deltascape source, ask for donations and pocket money.</p>
<p>If you’ve noticed, this community of RSPS has become orientated around money.</p>
<p>I have the same O.C.D Problem as you.</p>
<p>Side note:</p>
<p>When I first started, I didn’t care about quality, I just wanted to learn. Which led to my shitty base in the download section lol.</p>
<p>I had to say that or I would seem like a contradicting hypocrite.</p>

              <p>I think that O.C.D definitely helps a programmer. Most members don’t give a shit about quality anymore because all they want is to be the owner of a popular server, thus, resulting in the sources that we, as the community, tend to use today.</p>

              <p>Well, I was browsing the forums… (‘browsing’) And I came across a server advertisement. As different and good as it claimed to be, it was still missing quality. It had those tiny little annoying bugs anyone could fix if they tried, but yet, it failed.</p>
<p>For example. The Dragon Claws ‘ints’ were wrong; too zoomed in, rotated incorrectly, etc… And how much effort can it take to change a number?</p>
<p>Another thing was the FUCKING GOD DAMN INVENTORY SPRITE THAT PISSES ME OFF! In nearly EVERY client used today, the inventory sprite is incorrect. It’s too big and looks terrible.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget the incorrect tab sprites and half-done sprite remakes. In many clients, the tabs used on the right (Like the buttons you click to change the interface) are ripped incorrectly and not properly made transparent. I’ve also noticed that some people use the scroll bar buttons flipped, to save time. How can you not see the incorrect lighting? It looks terrible. Same thing with some of the tabs used on right.</p>
<p>And more with the sprites. Why is it that some people use the new sprites, but have it look like shit with the unfinished minimap/background sprites? Maybe it’s because the minimap because a circle, but if I remember correctly, there’s a tutorial on fixing it.</p>
<p>So, from what I’ve gathered here, people don’t care that their clients look like shit. Some day when I have nothing to do, I’m going to log onto a 508 server and rip the sprites myself and maybe put into a client.</p>
<p>Now, it’s the server complaints. Oh yea. Let’s talk about DeltaScape. There’s many tiny, tiny bugs in there that need fixing. If we all work together, we can fix them one by one <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> (or not)</p>
<p>First one. The shopping bugs… When you try to sell an item, chances are, it’ll say something like “You need atleast two open inventory slots to sell that item.” when you don’t. Another one is the classic selling an item with a full inventory <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>When you try to sell an item with a full inventory, you can’t. This fails, because the server should not to <span class="bbcode-b">any</span> space checking when selling a non-stackable item. Why? The slot is being freed which makes room for money. I’ve also found that when selling an inventory with money in it, yet no free space, you can’t sell it. That’s just pathetic.</p>
<p>There’s more. Many more. However, I’m not going to sit here and name them all. I’m sure you all know atleast 1 more not mentioned here.</p>
<p>So here’s the part where I get into talking about O.C.D (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder). Personally, I think it really helps when programming because you notice every little detail and you can’t stand it, which is fixing comes to it.</p>
<p>This is why Back to Basics had every bug I could find fixed (Or atleast attempted), because I can’t stand to see things like the reversed scroll bar with improper shading, or the incorrect sprites, or the shopping bugs.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve explained it all, give me your opinions. Does having O.C.D help programmers? Do people really not give a shit about quality anymore? Why?</p>
