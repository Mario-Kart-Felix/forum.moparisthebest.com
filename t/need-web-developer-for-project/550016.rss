    <description>I&#39;m going to be releasing my server publicly very soon, it&#39;s a server that I hosted around a year ago but had to disband for awhile due to life complications but i&#39;m back for good and plan to make this server prosper as much as I possibly can. If you would like to take a look at the server you&#39;d be making a website and forums for here is a link to my original advertisement link
