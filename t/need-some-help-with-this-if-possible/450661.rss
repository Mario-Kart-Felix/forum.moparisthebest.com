    <description>Hey,

I have some difficulties with my client I think, whenever I type something, it doesn&#39;t show up above the players&#39; character. However, it does show up in the chatbox. I added a npc which would shout something, but you also cannot see that. Also, in combat, you don&#39;t see HP bars or hitsplats.

I&#39;m working with a low revision PI, 317 if I&#39;m correct.

Does anyone know what&#39;s wrong?</description>
