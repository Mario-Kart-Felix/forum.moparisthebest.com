    <title>[RESOLVED - DENIED] Debates</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-denied-debates/518692</link>
    <description>I believe general debates should be a child board of intellectual debates. 

Why? Think about it like &quot;tutorials and snippets&quot; Snippets used to just have a sticky, now it has a child board it&#39;s very similar.</description>

              <p>I like having them as two separate sections.  It makes it much clearer to people (even if they ignore it) that one section if for basic debates while the other is intended only for those debates/discussions that are intellectual.</p>
