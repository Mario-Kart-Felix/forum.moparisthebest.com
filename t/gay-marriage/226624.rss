    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gay-marriage/226624</link>
    <description>Okay, i know this is a touchy subject, but i want to see how people feel.

I think that everyone should be able to wed the person they believe is the love of their life...no matter what sex the partner is. I don&#39;t think it should be up to the Government to decide.

<p>Too bad no one understands what the hell that means, let alone cares. it doesn’t sound insulting at all. Really the arguing is just spam, the thread would be more enjoyable/mature/interesting if there weren’t any posts that have nothing to do with the subject.</p>
<p>Ontopic~ This thread reminds me of a thread on another forum that had something to do with relationships have nothing to do with your lifestyle and putting the word lifestyle in front of your relationship type is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Example: homosexual lifestyle.</p>
<p>It has everything to do with your lifestyle, I made a more informative post on there but the point is, it determines if you [i]make[/] life or not. As for if it is acceptable, I don’t think it matters. Just as long as they are happy, everyone deserves to be happy.</p>

              <p>I figure its all what the normal society thinks that effects the approval. Really, everyone thinks its unacceptable due to their religion or just because it isn’t “normal”. Still normal is undefinable because of its various descriptions, but most think its just odd to see something they don’t see every day. Opinions are agreed and discriminated every day all the time. It just matters where you are and how everyone else sees it. biased is all it is. I figure if you want to get married to someone the same sex, go ahead it’s your life. It’s just a disappointment that some have to ruin that for others. My biology teacher said that the rain forest is one of the most healthy social environments if it was applied to modern society. It’s because the more the variety, the more you see and experience. Anyone who’s stopping differences from happening, is sort of, well. selfish.</p>

I can’t prove that I’m right, I don’t have facts, But I can tell you from a Gay mans perspective.<br>
You think if i had the choice to be straight or gay i’d choose gay?</p>

<p>Why you you believe that though? Regular attraction has been proven to not be a choice, and rather based on survival and reproductive values. What makes you think that attraction for the opposite sex is different?</p>
