    <title>[ENSO II] - Looking for Website Developer / IP.BOARD Community Manager</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/enso-ii-looking-for-website-developer-ip-board-community-manager/536827</link>
    <description>Hello.

I&#39;m looking for a person who could take care of IPB forums. I&#39;m planning to launch second server which used to have 89 players after 2 weeks of launch. (Mentios II) it will be launched in 3-4 days and I need a website developer to build the forums up. I have already installed IP.Board 3.4.5. You will receive developer rank in-game. Enso needs a website developer too so if you&#39;re interested feel free to contact me. 
You don&#39;t need to be super skilled and have huge amount of knowledge in website programming, just regular understanding how forum systems work and basics of website development.

Contact me by using skype if you&#39;re interested: NexonLTD</description>
