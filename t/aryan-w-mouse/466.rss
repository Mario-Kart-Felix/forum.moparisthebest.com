    <title>Aryan w/ mouse?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/aryan-w-mouse/466</link>
    <description>I know this may sound very stupid to some people, but I really enjoy using the program Aryan, but I understand that it banns or is detectable...yet I still use it :). I have tried SCAR scripts, but none of them run even close to how smooth and good Aryan runs. Does this banning of more Aryan accounts then SCAR have to do with this (how smooth they run and how the randoms are always great?) I was wondering if there would be less of a chance of getting banned if Aryan could be used with a mouse, not like a ghostmouse. I understand that the whole point of Aryan is this ghost mouse type thing but I believe that if we could find a way to run the scripts smoothly using the mouse, we could slip past the banning part of it. Thank you for considering this.</description>

Ehhh, you should learn about what you’re saying and the subject you’re talking about.  ;\</p>
<p>It did have a sexy mouse (&lt;3 Semaphore) and it didn’t force actions, but it still had a hell of a lot of issues that didn’t even involve with playing the game itself.</p>

              <p>Aryan gets banned for its many flaws.  If your account is flagged and you’re running Aryan, what mouse movements are going to be sent to the server when there are not many.  Some processes are done without the mouse at all.</p>
<p>Autoing anything, or working legit will raise a brow if you got 12+ hours.</p>
