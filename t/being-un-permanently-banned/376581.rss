    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/being-un-permanently-banned/376581</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not sure of this? i&#39;ve heard different things from different people.
I&#39;ve heard mostley that if you were banned for botting you would be unbanned in like 3years? wheres proof of this? is it true?

if so.. would i be unbanned in like 2years?

In 3-4 years after a perm ban, it is removed and the account is 100% reset, including the hp, this happened to some other players, and they were level 1, very rare accs, but i dont think they do that anymore lol<br>
[/quote]<br>
No… Jagex used to completely re-set your account in classic and made it level 1. They no longer do it anymore. They recently started rolling some of your stats back when you botted as a punishment.[/quote]<br>
Oops yeah, it was in classic, though i have seen a lvl 1 on rs2</p>

<p>I, Budgie Str have been a loyal player to RuneScape for over 2 years now. I have been a member for 16 months of that time and have helped many players with their own adventures. While playing your game, I have never even heard of a ‘Macro’ or ‘Bot’ nor Used one. I hope you reconsider my case, and hopefully I can get back to RuneScapin’ my Life away <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

I'm a well respected and expirienced player and i have never used a macro of any kind. i think this has been a very bad mistake and i hope this will be reveresed because i'm a long time lover and user of this game. please take this into consideration because this game is a part of my life, thanks.

<blockquote>Jagex, I have never used a source of macros for an advantage in game play in RuneScape. I have however been playing at a efficient rate of close to 10hours+ of game play per day. I did however browser the forums and post my progress there. I can see how you might think i used this method of using a macro because of the spike in game play. But rest assure that this is a big misunderstanding. you can see how long I've played this game and I've never done anything remarkably close to this. I would truly appreciate to remove this offense. Thanks

<p>Unless jagex removes all permanent bans like they did when the new ceo came(which is not likely) you will not be unbanned.</p>

              <p>Well I was banned permanetely on a game, basically you’re not getting unbanned unless you make up a good appeal. My first appeal got rejected, 2nd got rejected but they said to appeal again in 6 months, so I did and I got unbanned. Btw this wasn’t in RS, so it might be different.</p>
