    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-far-back-in-time-in-england-could-i-talk-to-the-locals/542096</link>
    <description>I&#39;m wondering how far back in time I could go and comfortably talk to those around me using our current English language.

I&#39;ve tried looking online but just can&#39;t find any information.</description>

However, I’m sure that there was a word for “arrogant dickhead” in whatever time period you travel to, so you’d get along just fine.<br>

              <p>It’s actually a very interesting question, I don’t know why Pure thinks it isn’t. Old English -&gt; Middle English -&gt; Modern English was actually a very smooth transition (well, there were some big spikes in rapid change depending on who was warring at the time and who won) but depending on how much you want to understand to define ‘understanding fully’, you could actually go pretty far back - but you would run into some problems.</p>
<p>To give you a reference point, Shakespeare’s language (which you probably find pretty strange, right?) was still Modern English - though only just. He’s a bit of a bad example though because his language was strange even for the time, very dialectical and full of wordplay and weirdness. You could probably go back to his era and hold a conversation… though, it obviously wouldn’t be like talking to me today. A little stilted. Understandable, though.</p>
<p>Much further back than that and you end up in a very different language - but still understandable, particularly towards the end, where the first attempt at ‘standardising’ english came in. (This is when we switched to using pronouns like ‘their’ rather than ‘hir’) - around the 1450’s.</p>
<p>However, if you’re willing to stretch ‘understanding’ a bit, you can go back a bit further, even.</p>
<blockquote>That slepen al the nyght with open ye
(So priketh hem Nature in hir corages);
Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages
And palmeres for to seken straunge strondes</blockquote>
<p>Not modern english that’s for sure, but not <em>totally</em> foreign. This is probably where sane people would go ‘yep, that’s too far back’.</p>
<p>If you hit Old English, you’ve definitely gone too far:</p>
<blockquote>Cnut cyning gret his arcebiscopas and his leod-biscopas and Þurcyl eorl and ealle his eorlas and ealne his þeodscype, twelfhynde and twyhynde, gehadode and læwede, on Englalande freondlice.</blockquote>
<p>TLDR: The further back you go, the more Romantic influences you remove, and the less likely it gets that you’d be able to hold a conversation. But contrary to Pure’s opinion, I think I’d be more than comfortable in the 1700s and probably earlier - it would be a little tough, but no tougher I think than going to a country where you don’t speak the language perfectly.</p>

<p>Yes, “French” is the word you’re looking for. I would guess that 300-400 years would be the like range, I think they might have more problems understanding you, than you have understanding them. This is because modern people are more used to several versions of their own language and people were more isolated before.</p>

<p>Words do change along with grammar. You keep proving that by assuming that one would find it hard to understand the extract (consisting entirely of words). However, I’m sure that there was a word for “arrogant dickhead” in whatever time period you travel to, so you’d get along just fine.</p>

Because nobody sane ponders this question. From a chronological perspective, probably around 20-30 years, seeing as how it’s when the hip-hop culture rose to prominence and changed our every-day language forever! (purely speculation though)<br>

<p>The fact that I can read the below excerpt from 1702 says otherwise. What’s “insane” about wondering how long the language spoken in England has recognisably resembled our own?</p>

              <p>Just look through old documents and find the earliest thing you can understand. You might not be able to speak to everyone in England, but you might have good luck with some people. Just remember that they might find your language offensive, in case you happen to stumble upon the 17th century.</p>
