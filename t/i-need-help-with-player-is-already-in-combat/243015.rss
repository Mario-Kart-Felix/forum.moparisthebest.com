i have a little but very  :mad: problem

when i go into my pkbox(to pk ) and i attack someone i just can fight with this person.
but when this person leaves the area, and someone else try&#39;s to attack me.
he gets the messenge:
player is already in combat

and im not!

              <p>I actually had this issue awhile back, all you need to do is make the server know the player isn’t under attack if that player’s attack is reset.</p>

              <p>its in the client file look for the combat section it will be like player is in combat then the little code for the time you need to wait to attackt them if thats at 0 then it will screw it up make it like 5 to eliminate multi combat there and yet then you can still fight som1 after som1 else runs  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
