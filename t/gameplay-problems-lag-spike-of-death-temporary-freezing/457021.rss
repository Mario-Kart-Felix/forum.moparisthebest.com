    <description>Alright, I&#39;m not sure if I have fixed the problem, but I&#39;m posting this thread just to see if there is any confirmation.

I fired up Minecraft awhile back and today, and I noticed I was having some extreme lag after about a minute of gameplay. I would freeze for about 10 seconds, unfreeze for 1, then freeze again. My mouse would become unusable and I would have to end Minecraft via the Task Manager or wait for it to close.

I did some research today and ended up switching from Java 7 back to 6u31. I also installed OptiFine Smooth mod to further the setting usage (I didn&#39;t change much). I played for around 5 minutes on both Single and Multiplayer without any problems.

[b]I&#39;m just curious if this can be confirmed that Java 7 may have been the problem, or am I just getting lucky being able to play now?[/b] I close most applications when I play and my memory usage is getting nowhere near maxed during gameplay. My machine specs should be able to handle Minecraft on all max settings for the most part (which it does and has).</description>

              <p>I’ve had absolutely no problems since I downgraded. I installed the mods before I downgraded Java and the problems persisted. The problem is fixed, I’d played around an hour without any problems and got off.</p>
<p>My machine is pretty bulky and should have no problem running on max settings for this game. I was using Java 7u6 when it had the errors.</p>
<p>Are there any major things that could happen using Java 6u31 instead of 7+?</p>

              <p>Same, the only problem I am facing is that pistons don’t show up but that’s about it. I have the same problem on my work computer (win 7 64 bit integrated graphics) tho that could just be from the shitty integrated graphics.</p>
