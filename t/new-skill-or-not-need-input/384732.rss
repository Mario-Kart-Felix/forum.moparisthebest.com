    <description>I posted this on RSCAftermath forums, Looking for feedback.

Ok let me begin by saying anyone of you &quot;hardcore rsc fans&quot; who shootdown any ideas without even reading them, just because they add depth to your precious game. GTFO





Alright Since I&#39;ve not been playing RSC as much lately I&#39;ve had time to ponder the reasons why I always get bored with it after a few months, and as a result came up with some ways that might fix that. RSC is an extremely shallow game in terms of combat and numbers. Everyone runs around in the same exact setup with the same exact inventory, especially at the flats levels. The only variables are the random numbers that java creates. Outside of that everything is the exact same. Thats why so much of pking is focused on the casting and catching and hardly any on the combat itself. So I&#39;ve been thinking up ways of adding a bit more depth into combat, without completely changing the combat formula.


What I&#39;ve come up with is something that I&#39;d like to call Armsmaster Skill(I use the word skill loosely because it could just as easily be an npc that you trade &quot;rune plate&quot; and &quot;random modifier enhancer&quot; with to get the created item). So in a nut shell the Armsmaster skill would allow you to make minor customizations to your gear. These customizations could be +prayer, +magic + str +def + att +wep aim +wep power + ranged power + magic power, at any ranom interval i.e. anywhere from +1 to +10. This would allow greater depth in the combat system as you would be able to customize your gear to whatever your style of play would be. It would allow people to take on different roles for pking, events and maybe future bosses. I.E. if you had a team maybe one person would load up on +def and do the attacking, while the others loaded up on +range or mage or something. Or loading up on +def for when you want to farm drops in the wilderness. But most importantly of all it would give all you flats who stand around in edge something to do 


Now how this could be implemented. Well the simplest way would be to add the enhancement modifier to npc drops, bosses, event reward, kdr rewards. Then you would take these enhancements to an npc and exchange the enhancement and the armour piece you want to be changed. He will take them and give you the enhanced weapon or armour. This would be very easy to implement with the hardest part being the testing on various configurations. 

Another way would be to make a skill out of  it. For example to make a +1 mage boost you would take a bronze bar, add a saphire to it and cast an enchant spell on it, and then add it to your item to be enhanced. With different and better enhancements unlocked at higher levels, possibly reserving the greatest enhancements for quest rewards, drops or event rewards. Maybe adding new other new gems and ores for it as well. This would take a good deal of work as there would need to be new sprites, spells and the entire skill needing to be created and tested.


In closing, what I&#39;m suggesting here will not completely change the game or undermine the importance of casting and catching, but it will add more depth to the combat system, add more possibilites for further unique content and as a whole and as a result make the game more fun for those who get bored with the same old rsc and like to see new ideas.

I did something similar, and made it so that you only had a specific %age that the item would be successfully upgraded. In some instances of item upgrade failure, the item would be destroyed - making it more of a risk for people upgrading their items.<br>

<p>That sounds like a pretty good idea. I was also thinking about just ripping off the enchanting skill from wow on the basis that it would do all of this plus keep rune and dragon numbers in check.[/quote]</p>
<p>Never played, nor seen the enchantment skill in WoW, so wouldn’t know much about it myself.</p>

              <p>Basically, you want to turn rsc into a proper MMORPG. I love the idea of enchantments however, it just doesn’t suit rsc. Its like having NEONS and a roof scoop and tinted windows on a burnt out shit hole of a (input name of a shit car here ). I mean hell yeah give it ago see how it goes, but you may just find out you’ve wasted your time. However, it is experience for you so go for it anyway.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
