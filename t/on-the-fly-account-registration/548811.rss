    <title>On-the-fly Account registration</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/on-the-fly-account-registration/548811</link>
    <description>I am currently implementing SRP on a game I am developing. However, I will be distributing this game server and client, so I would like registration to be allowable on-the-fly, without requiring the host to use some sort of forum or email communication to pre-register the account before the first login. I&#39;ll go over the basic flow of SRP, and then my registration changes.

SRP Documentation: Found [url=http://srp.stanford.edu/design.html]Here[/url]

[ol][li]The User enters their username and password into the client.[/li]
[li]The client sends the username and a randomly generated value to the server.[/li]
[li]The server gets the salt and password verifier (which is the result of a function on the password, both stored externally) of the user and sends the salt and another randomly generated value to the client.[/li]
[li]Each side now independently calculates a strong shared session key, and proves that key to each other.[/li]
[li]If both proofs match, the user has successfully authenticated.[/li][/ol]


To add the registration functionality, here are my proposed changes.

[ol][li]The User enters their username and password into the client.[/li]
[li]The client sends the username and a randomly generated value to the server.[/li]
[li]The server checks to see if there currently exists a user with the username sent from the client.[/li]
[li]If no user exists, the server sends the RSA Public key to the client, requesting the client to generate a salt, and verifier.[/li]
[li]The client sends the salt and verifier to the server, and encodes it with the public key.[/li]
[li]The server decodes the salt and verifier with the private key.[/li]
[li]Each side now independently calculates a strong shared session key, and proves that key to each other.[/li]
[li]If both proofs match, the user has successfully authenticated.[/li]
[li]If the user has authenticated sucessfully, the salt and verifier are saved to the database, or file for the user.[/li][/ol]

Would this be an acceptable, secure form of on-the-fly registration? Or are there some things that I haven&#39;t considered?</description>
