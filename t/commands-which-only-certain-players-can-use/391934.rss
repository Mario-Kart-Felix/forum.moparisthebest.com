    <title>Commands which only certain players can use</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/commands-which-only-certain-players-can-use/391934</link>
    <description>Hello,

I really would like some help with something.  We have had a donation with a request for a house.  He wants a command which only him and another player can use.  Other players cannot use it.

Is there a way which this can happen?  If so, please could I have a hint - PS. I DON&#39;T WANNA BE SPOONFED, SO JUST HELP ME NOT SPOONFEED!

Cheers</description>

              <p>Start off the command with:	if (playerCommand.startsWith(“CommandName”) &amp;&amp; c.playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(“Players name”)) {<br>
Just add 2 example:<br>
if (playerCommand.startsWith(“example”) &amp;&amp; c.playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(“player”)) {<br>
if (playerCommand.startsWith(“example”) &amp;&amp; c.playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(“player1”)) {<br>
Like that except "Player and Player 1 would be the other players names.</p>
