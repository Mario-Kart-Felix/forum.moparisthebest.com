    <description>I&#39;m running Tokkulscape 508 source and I keep needing to update it. I try and use the jrebel method from a post in Server Tutorials. Is there a way to fix that method for the 508 bulby servers? I keep getting errors when running. I want to be able to compile without restarting constantly. Where do I put the .xml file and such. What should my run.bat and compile.bat have in it? I&#39;m so confused.</description>
