    <title>Player Appearance ids</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-appearance-ids/481701</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;m trying to figure out what the max player appearance ints are (that set the way a player looks)
example: Torso goes from # to #, beard goes from # to #.
I need all of them though ^-^
Thanks</description>
