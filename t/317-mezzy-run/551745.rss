    <title>[317] Mezzy (RUN)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-mezzy-run/551745</link>
    <description>Hello there, I have recently decided to get Mezzyscape and work on it, fix it up and mess around with it.
I really have always liked it, but have never really gone to it until today.
Anyways, I downloaded the Source/Client: ( http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,594414.0.html )
Fixed all the errors mentioned on the post with Eclipse... Then I set up the Run Configs for Client/Source... Then, when I try to run the client, it works just fine... However, the Source, isn&#39;t running or maybe it is, but I just can&#39;t tell because this is all that it gives me on Eclipse.. This is what happens when I hit &quot;RUN&quot; ( http://prntscr.com/7bb74n )
[CODE]

Usage:
    java com.rs.Server [debug/release] [gui/nogui]
[/CODE]

I can&#39;t understand it really. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you very much.</description>

<p>Ah I see. Thanks for the link, I took a look at it.<br>
This may sound very dumb of me; However, I am still stuck on this, not sure exactly what to do.<br>
I know it also may seem like i’m asking for too much “Help” It’s honestly because I have no clue what’s going on.<br>

In eclipse, click “Run” in the file menu, and then click on "Run Configurations…"<br>
Now in the GUI that just showed up, select the configuration that is for your source.<br>
Underneath the “Name” field you will see some tabs. Click on the “Arguments” tab.<br>
Now type in “debug” (with no quotes) and “gui” (again, no quotes) into the “Program Arguments” field.<br>
Press apply and/or run. You should be good to go now.</p>
<p>It’ll look a bit like this:<br>

I <span class="bbcode-b">really</span> need to clean out my configs, but ignore that.[/quote]<br>
I already had the run config setup, but the missing part was ( debug gui ) Thank you as always. Your the best man!</p>
