1. How do I change the home teleport to teleport to my starting place.
2. How can i make closed doors open? I click on door and it doesnt open? I try going into client.java and find deltethatwall but nothing with walls come up it says cannotfind.
3. How do I change the client, like i dont want it to show the Server Ip: and Port: i want that off just username and password.
4. How do I change the client backround image.
5. I know how to deleteobjects but when I put in the correct code and w.e the object is still there!
