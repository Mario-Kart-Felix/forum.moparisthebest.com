    <title>Looking for a somewhat old-school server to play, been away from RSPS for years</title>

    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;ve been away from the rsps community for a couple years and I&#39;m looking for a somewhat old-school server. Doesn&#39;t have to be 2006 but I don&#39;t want all the new shit. 
Hopefully I can find a server with some more mature kids, I&#39;m 19.. Don&#39;t feel like watching 13 year olds spamming 24/7.
Preferably around 10 - 30 players.

If you know of any that fit this description please let me know! 
Thanks.</description>
