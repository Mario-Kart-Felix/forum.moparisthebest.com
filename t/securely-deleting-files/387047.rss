    <title>Securely Deleting Files</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/securely-deleting-files/387047</link>
    <description>When you delete a file through the recycle bin it doesn&#39;t actually delete it, it just hides it and keeps a reference.

My question is: If you use a recovery tool to get the file back and then securely delete it (write over the space with random 0s and 1s) will it write over the file you originally deleted through the recycle bin or does the recovery tool make a copy of the file you deleted and then securely delete that, meaning the original file that was deleted still exists?

It&#39;s a bit hard to understand but its the best I can do. Thanks

<p>Firstly, there is no guarantee that when you do that the file editor isn’t just saving it as a new file, deleting, and renaming, in fact, many do that, so it would be no better than deleting.  (perhaps worse, because you don’t know if it just deleted it)</p>
<p>Secondly, I think fancy commercial data recovery like that available to law enforcement forensic labs and such will most certainly be able to recover at least something, since, even if a file is over-written, sometimes there are magnetic remains left behind to gather some information from, this is why ‘secure deletion’ utilities generally write over that area of the disk hundreds or thousands of times with random data, hoping all traces are deleted.</p>

<p>At the moment I use Eraser or Wipe depending on which OS I’m using but these only work for files which I haven’t deleted yet.<br>
These programs write 0s and 1s to the hard drive in the space which the file I’m deleting occupies, to make it unrecoverable.</p>
<p>My first post basically says “If I recover a file using a file recovery tool, then delete it with eraser or wipe, can it then be recovered?”</p>
