    <description>Believe I asked this before....Didn&#39;t get an answer, so I figured I&#39;de post one more time to see if anyone knew.

How would you change the possible length of character names from 12 to say 20? I believe someone told me it was completely client sided....But I&#39;m not sure what to change, since I&#39;m not all that good with clients.

Can anyone help?</description>
