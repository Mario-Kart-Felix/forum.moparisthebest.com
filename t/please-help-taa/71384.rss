    <description>ok then, ive had my server down for about a week or so now, and when i open it i want to have a re-opening party! The original opening party... well lets just say it could be better! lol it was just a drop party followed by some skimpish pking.. lol! The drop party was VERY un-organised last time, so i would like to make it more organised, so instead of having a d-party, i decided what if i spawn stuff, like a huge tresure trail for the whole server! Anyway to get the the point...
...
I need to know if theres a way of spawning an item, and it stays there for 30mins without dissapearing untill someone picks it up, then once someone picks it up knowone else can see the spawn... is this possible???? 

if you could get back to me ASAP it would be great!</description>
