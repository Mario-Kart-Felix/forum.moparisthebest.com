    <title>This would be a cool tut</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-would-be-a-cool-tut/112799</link>
    <description>i just now thought of this but i don&#39;t want to go digging for methods and stuff... haven&#39;t been with p servers for a while but..

you have a NPC moderator, he detects massing and walks up to you and above his head he says &quot;+playername+ stop massing or you will be banned&quot;

then the second time he walks up and IP bans you.

wouldn&#39;t it be possible to just pack those methods into a npc? so you wont have to watch your server, just leave it up with npc mods walking around?</description>

How you got 61 rep beats me. It’s not even called a void. It’s called a freaken method. And quit asking and why not try and do it?[/quote]</p>
<p>So are you saying it takes rep to know how to code? Look at me, 106 rep, and I just made a couple simple tuts… So it’s not hard to get rep on here, and it’s not just based on how well you code… Budda, for example, only has 23 rep, yet he is a freakin’ awesome coder… So think before you post.</p>

<p>No it’s not. It’s possible. I would make it, but it’s lame, so I won’t. But heres a hint: npcHandler.java.</p>
<p>In there is all the npcWalking things, all the talking, and its quite easy to make it ban them after they say something.</p>
<p>Ethan, next time don’t post about shit you know nothing about. It makes you seem retarded.</p>
