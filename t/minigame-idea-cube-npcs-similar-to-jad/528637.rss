    <title>Minigame idea: Cube NPCs [Similar to Jad]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/minigame-idea-cube-npcs-similar-to-jad/528637</link>
    <description>I just had a few cups of coffee so I figured i&#39;d do a little brainstorming. In no way will I be implementing this anytime soon, however you&#39;re free to steal the idea if you feel like it&#39;s good. Go ahead and criticize me, good and bad.

The idea:

[ul]6 waves of cube NPCs: (This part is solo&#39;d.)
[list][li]Each wave gets twice as hard, meaning double the HP and damage.[/li]
[li]At the end of the sixth wave the last dice will drop a 10th sigil crystal*, which will be used to teleport to the boss. The crystal can be used to skip the waves and head to a waiting lobby, however it will disintegrate after 10 uses.[/li]
[li]The waiting lobby contains a bank, and two portals. One to solo the boss and one to take it on with a clan of up to three. If the portal is in use, then you will be put in a queue list. When you&#39;re up, you have one minute to do any last minute banking.[/li][/list]

*Used in Monkey Madness quest.

The boss:
[list][li]The boss will be a much bigger cube with question marks on each side.[/li]
[li]There will be six special attacks dealt to the player(s) throughout the battle, based on the HP level of the NPC. Each special attack will get stronger, and the final special attack will deal two strikes instead of one.[/li]
[/list]

The loot:
[list][li]The loot will depend on if you solo&#39;d it or had a clan of players. If there were multiple players, it will be split up evenly.[/li]
[li]The value of the loot is based on how long you take to kill it. The quicker you kill it, the better the loot. The level of the NPC will be based on the level you and/or clan members are. This is so everybody has a fair chance of getting good drops.[/li]
[li]You will also be awarded a certain amount of points based on how fast the boss it killed, in exchange you can buy an XP lamp.[/li]
[/list]

I&#39;m tired so i&#39;m sure i&#39;m missing a lot of detail.[/ul]
