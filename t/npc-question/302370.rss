    <title>NPC Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-question/302370</link>
    <description>Alright here&#39;s the question: How remove an NPC&#39;s ability to walk? And also follow. I want to make a monster thats aggressive, and attacks you when u run by with lets say wind wave but doesn&#39;t chase you or walk up to you, it only stays in it&#39;s spawn spot. I&#39;ve seen other servers with the corp beast(aggressive) where the beast doesn&#39;t move/chase/run up to you, but it will face you and attack anyone in its lair with mage. My server is a 317 if that helps. THANKS![br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 14, 2009, 07:36:49 pm[/size][hr]anyone?</description>
