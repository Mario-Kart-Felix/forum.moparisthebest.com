    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-object-places/372591</link>
    <description>Hey guys im wondering if you can help me, I have a 525 rsps. I just looked everywhere and i have no clue. Does anyone know how to change the position/place of a object. I want to change the place of my stall. If you can tell me what folder it is in to change it i can figure it out. Object clicking 2 isnt it it just Shows you how much money you get per click i need to know where to move it. The stall is located in ardounge also. If you can help me Post when folder or txt folder its in or add my msn Brandonzemail@hotmail.com</description>

This. If you mean a object spawned where it normally isn’t I suggest finding where that object is (co-ordinates) and searching that in your server files. Most likely it will pop up. Or search the object id.</p>
<p>More then likely if it is in Ardounge, the stall came with the source, basically<br>
what im saying is that the stall was not spawned in the filers or folders of the source by<br>
a previous owner or whatever .[/quote]</p>
