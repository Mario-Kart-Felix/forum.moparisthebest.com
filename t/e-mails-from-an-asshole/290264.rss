---------------------------------------------------------------------------
From Mike Partlow to ***********@**********.org

Hello,

I am Staff Sgt. Mike Partlow and I am on a six month leave. I have nothing to do back in the states, and watching your kids sounds like fun. I love kids. I have plenty of activities for them and assure you they will always be kept busy. Let me know if you are interested and we can discuss pay.

Thanks,

SSG Partlow

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Donna ******** to Me

Mr. Partlow,

Thanks for responding! I am interested. Do you have any previous experience with kids? What kind of activities would you do? I am looking for something fun and eductational, and some sports for the boys. 

-Donna

From Mike Partlow to Donna **********

Donna,

I have lots of experience with kids from my time in the Middle East. I can teach my expertise to your kids through fun games and activities. I can teach them basic weapons training, close quarters combat, explosive ordinance disposal, and hand-to-hand combat. They will have a blast! I will provide the firearms but I would prefer if you pay for the ammunition. I can make the activities fun and educational. Kids really seem to enjoy basic weapons training when you put it in terms they can understand, for example, I used to teach the Middle Eastern kids how to accurately fire an M203 by a modified version of &quot;pin the tail on the donkey.&quot; Instead of a tail, it was a 40mm grenade, and instead of &quot;pinning&quot; it, they fired it from a safe distance. I assure you that safety is my number one concern with the kids, but also, them having fun is my top priority.

SSG Partlow

From Donna ******** to Me

Is this a joke? You realize these kids are mostly 7 years old, right?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Mike Partlow to Donna **********

Donna,

It is never too early to teach your children these basic life skills. I am aware that they are young and will adjust my program accordingly. We will be mostly using the 5.56mm M16A2, which is a great weapon for children. It is gas operated, so the recoil is minimal, making it a perfect gun for children to use. So what were you thinking as far as pay goes? I don&#39;t mean to cut to the chase, but I really need a job. 
SSG Partlow

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Donna ******** to Me

This is absurd. I really hope you aren&#39;t serious. 

I am not interested. Thanks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Mike Partlow to Donna **********

Donna, 

I am sorry that you are not interested. You may regret this if your child is ever put in a close quarters combat situation, and doesn&#39;t even know how to pop a magazine in his rifle. 

If you change your mind and decide you want your kids to grow up to be men, not pussies, let me know.

SSG Partlow&lt;/blockquote&gt;
