    <title>How Do I Change Shop Prices?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-change-shop-prices/147537</link>
    <description>Alright, so I know that I go into shops.cfg, then to the shop, but there are 4 columns, they are titled &quot;Sell&quot;, &quot;Buy&quot;, &quot;Item&quot;, and &quot;Amount&quot;
I know &quot;Item&quot;, and &quot;Amount&quot; is the item ID and amount of it, then I&#39;m on to &quot;Buy&quot; and &quot;Sell&quot;. I changed on of these but nothing happened to the shop&#39;s prices. How Do I change the shop prices is my root question. Help is greatly apprieciated.

Thanks!
