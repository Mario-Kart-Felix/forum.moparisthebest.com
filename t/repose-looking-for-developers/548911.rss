[b]What is Repose?[/b]
[i]&quot;Repose started as a small little project I was working on after I quit development with another server. I have been working on this PI server for about three weeks now, and in that time most of it was spent removing content instead of adding it. After removing most of the content and such of the base server, it suddenly sparked inside of me that I should start making this server better.&quot;[/i]

This server is not going to be ready to be released for quite awhile. A few months, more than likely. So if you&#39;re going to apply, do not expect to have players within days, because there is much to be done.

Current staff
Me - Server &amp; Client Developer

Currently, I am looking for 2 Server Developers.

<p>Why should you be chosen?</p>
<p>I can not only provide some aspects of programming into the server, but I also have a vps and a domain.</p>
<p>Anything else you want to add: I’d prefer to do a 2007 based server, I have many ideas about this and hope to hear from you soon.</p>
