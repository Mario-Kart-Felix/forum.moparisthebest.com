    <title>My First Image</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-first-image/161789</link>
    <description>I know that I pretty much suck at it, but for some reason, I like creating images. Most of the images I create though I never put out in public, except for my logo&#39;s I create, which for the most part are pretty good... And I want to see now if I&#39;m any good or not.

This is my first time trying this, so please go easy. Its an RS2 Buddy Icon I made. Please remember that just because I made a RS2 buddy icon, that does not mean that I like runescape. Runescape sucks ass, and takes too much time. I edited some parts, put in some hands, smashed things together, made the border from scratch (tried to make it look a little like the 471 cache border for RS2. Again, I was bored! lol.), and found some images to add to the blank spaces. The background for the image (including within the images borders) is transparent, and should be able to be placed in any thing. Although I may have made some errors, and forgot to erase them off it.... lol.

Here it is (I know, it sucks...)-

I know that I incorrectly flipped some things, and placed some of the fingers in teh wrong dirrection... but I&#39;m not using PhotoShop. I use a look-alike of it thats free, called paint.NET. Its pretty good, and has the basic features of PhotoShop, including the effects. Again, I was bored, and this is my first time making a buddy icon.

Please post your comments.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 01, 2007, 04:59:39 AM[/size][hr]I&#39;m probably going to practice more on them, because I found some cool knew graphix to add to a new one. lol.</description>

              <p>I never did either… and anyways, PhotoShop is free? I thought you had to pay to use the CS series? And the image I made really was just throwing things together. I made that awhile ago, lol.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 01, 2007, 05:33:10 PM[/size][hr][quote=“xxlegitxx, post:2, topic:161789”]You can also get photoshop for free…</p>
<p>It’s not bad if it were pixel art.  Considering you probably just copy and pasted, I’d say its mediocre.[/quote] Do you mean like KeyGen?</p>
