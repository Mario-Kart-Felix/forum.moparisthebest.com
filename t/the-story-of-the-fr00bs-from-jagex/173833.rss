    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-story-of-the-fr00bs-from-jagex/173833</link>
    <description>Once upon a time, someone from jagex joined mopar. Then jagex says &quot;WE OUT OF IDEAZ! OH NOES!&quot;.

The person from jagex tells the other people from jagex about mopar... then one of the jagex people say

&quot;OOH! SUMMONING!&quot;.

Not long later, the fr00bs leech summoning from us!

Reeper620: LAWL!

End of story. Hope you liked.</description>

              <p>Read there devolupment diarys, They was planning on it, but put it on hold because there Game engine couldn’t hold it or something:</p>
<p>[quote]Summoning was first mentioned in the Behind the Scenes (BTS) of March 31st 2004. “We wrote that BTS to suggest some of the things we wanted to do, which we now could with the new RuneScape engine (RS2), to encourage players to move over from RuneScape Classic,” says Paul, Senior Game Designer. A lot of those projects have since been released – Construction, Treasure Trails, boardgames, quest journals – but of the rest, Paul continues, “They’re big projects and, previously, we couldn’t work on many at the same time…some were a little on the optimistic side! (laughs) Summoning was being talked about by players even before that BTS, though, and we agreed it was a cool idea, so we had to do it.” Players have been talking about and expecting it ever since.</p>
<p>“Initially, we were considering Summoning as an addition to Magic. We actually made the life rune for Classic, but didn’t release it. Some players discovered its existence, but there was no way to actually get it,” says Paul. Developing the RS2 engine held up things for a while and, by the time we got back to Summoning, there’d been some changes. “At that point, Magic was already filling out and we were also concepting Desert Treasure and alternate spellbooks, so decided it would be better as a new skill rather than an addition to an older one,” says Mod Mark.</p>
