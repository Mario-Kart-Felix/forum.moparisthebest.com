    <description>Hi everyone,
The reason I am coming to you today is to search for a team of dedicated, experienced java coders, also 2 php coders.
All expenses regarding hosting of the server, web host, and domain is taken care of. I have a dedicated server with 4 cores cpu and 7 gb ram available for use on this project.
I am looking to start up a Large scale server, of the 718 revision. 
My plan is to start off with one skilling world, and later move on to have two worlds, on skilling on pvp dedicated.
When joining this project you ARE joining as an owner, and everyone on the team has an equal say as to what we do.
If you are interested please PM me, reply to this thread, or contact me via skype(preferred):Microchip1233
Thank You.</description>
