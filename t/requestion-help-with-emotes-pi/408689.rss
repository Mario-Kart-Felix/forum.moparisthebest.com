    <title>Requestion help with emotes. [pi]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/requestion-help-with-emotes-pi/408689</link>
    <description>hey guys, i am using pi base and i am trying to fix my emotes, currently you can spam click skillcape emotes and any other emote and it will start it while your in another emote.

i have looked on runescape and it sends a return message saying, you are already in an emote.
i have tryed searching that in google and havnt come across anything. if someone could help that would be a huge help.</description>
