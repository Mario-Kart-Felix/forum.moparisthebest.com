    <title>[Review] x10Hosting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/review-x10hosting/515882</link>
    <description>I used x10 hosting a couple years ago in January. They have excellent service and they stay true to their words, when it comes to their web servers etc. However, they lack customer support. This year I tried registering a new website with them. Of course I got invalid because I still have an existing account and all that. So I went to hop on the community forums for help. I couldn&#39;t gain access. I tried registering, it said my email was already used. Then I tried getting my password sent to my email. Waited 30 mins (it&#39;s actually been about 3 hours now), and received no email. So I decided to join their chat room. It took a minute for someone to reply, and I eventually found out some rather irritating information. My account is still a premium account, even though I haven&#39;t used/paid it in more than a year. Not only that, but premium users can only get support by using the &quot;Support Ticket&quot; system. One of the staff members of the chat said &quot;Premium users get help by dedicated hired staff in the support ticket system&quot; so naturally that means near 24/7 support and such. Here&#39;s a the time-stamps of my ticket.
Created ticket: 04/12/2013 23:00
Staff Reply: 04/13/2013 01:52
My Reply: 04/13/2013 01:55
I&#39;m currently waiting for another response.
So to wrap this all up:

Free members gets a Chat room, Forums, Support tickets (less dedicated support team I assume), and a wiki.
Premium members get &quot;Dedicated hired staff in the support ticket system.&quot;

Overall I give x10hosting a 8/10 with actual hosting. 3/10 with support.</description>

<p>None of the x10 branches are re-sellers; they’re a pretty large company. Been around since roughly 2003(?) and at the last count that I could find online had over 300,000 free and paid hosting accounts (this was in 2008). I personally have no complaints whatsoever towards x10, I’ve used their <a href="http://x10premium.com/infinity" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">infinity package</a> for a number of years now and literally no problems have cropped up.</p>

<p>I’m getting really shit service with customer support.<br>
I have a free account turned premium (turned free again??) from years back. I want to use the email account again.<br>
They said "Hello Jesse,</p>
<p>You should be able to create a free hosting account at <a href="http://x10hosting.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://x10hosting.com</a></p>
<p>Best Regards,<br>
Syed"<br>
Now obviously that can’t happen because the email is already in use.</p>
<p>Like I said, their service is great aside from customer support.</p>

              <p>I used x10 hosting a couple years ago in January. They have excellent service and they stay true to their words, when it comes to their web servers etc. However, they lack customer support. This year I tried registering a new website with them. Of course I got invalid because I still have an existing account and all that. So I went to hop on the community forums for help. I couldn’t gain access. I tried registering, it said my email was already used. Then I tried getting my password sent to my email. Waited 30 mins (it’s actually been about 3 hours now), and received no email. So I decided to join their chat room. It took a minute for someone to reply, and I eventually found out some rather irritating information. My account is still a premium account, even though I haven’t used/paid it in more than a year. Not only that, but premium users can only get support by using the “Support Ticket” system. One of the staff members of the chat said “Premium users get help by dedicated hired staff in the support ticket system” so naturally that means near 24/7 support and such. Here’s a the time-stamps of my ticket.<br>
Created ticket: 04/12/2013 23:00<br>

My Reply: 04/13/2013 01:55<br>
I’m currently waiting for another response.<br>
So to wrap this all up:</p>
<p>Free members gets a Chat room, Forums, Support tickets (less dedicated support team I assume), and a wiki.<br>
Premium members get “Dedicated hired staff in the support ticket system.”</p>
<p>Overall I give x10hosting a 8/10 with actual hosting. 3/10 with support.</p>
