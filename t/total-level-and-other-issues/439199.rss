    <description>Hi people long time I don&#39;t work with rsps for personal stuff, and I dont remember some stuff and I need to fix some things on my server.

Am using insidiax source, I think is a PI.

In any account is made, all of them has total level: 2475, how can I fix that?
And how do I change the xp rate of combat skills?

Thanks Mates.</description>
