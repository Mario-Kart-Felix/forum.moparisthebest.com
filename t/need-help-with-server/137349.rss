    <description>using P16 blitz source and i need help fixing the mage and a problem with monsters + eating. The mage just doesnt work, even if you have runes. and the problem with monsters is sometimes when they get to low hp u cant hit them anymore u just hit 0s but they can still hit you. and the eating problem is you can only eat when ur not fighting.</description>
