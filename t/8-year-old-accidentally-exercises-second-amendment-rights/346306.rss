    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;NORFOLK, VA—Gun owners nationwide are applauding the patriotic, though accidental, exercise of Second Amendment rights by 8-year-old Timothy Cummings Tuesday.

&quot;Timothy is a symbol of American heroism,&quot; said NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre from Cummings&#39; bedside at Norfolk General Hospital, where the boy is in serious but stable condition from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. &quot;While praying for his recovery, we should all thank God that his inalienable right to keep and bear arms has not been infringed.&quot;

The incident occurred shortly after Cummings returned from school and found that his parents were absent from the house. Displaying what Second Amendment-rights groups are calling &quot;good old-fashioned American ingenuity,&quot; Cummings placed a pair of phone books on a stool to retrieve his father&#39;s loaded .38-caliber revolver from its hiding place on a closet shelf. After a preliminary backyard investigation of his constitutional rights claimed the life of Pepper, the family&#39;s cocker spaniel, Cummings fell on the weapon, causing it to discharge into his left thigh.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>MITB I agree, I was taught at the age of 4 not to mess with guns and how to handle them safely! There IS such a thing as trigger locks and not keeping the pistol loaded would have helped… If only this story were true lol.</p>

<p>Anyway, if anything like this really did happen it would be 100% the parents fault for not:</p>
<ol>
<li>Teaching children from an early age about guns, the danger of them, how to safely handle them, and, perhaps most importantly, to only touch them with adult supervision.</li>
<li>Leaving the gun accessible to the child.</li>

              <p>Those NRA types are complete idiots. All things aside, assuming second amendment rights are okay, we still don’t give them to children.<br>
The first amendment protects freedom of speech but we don’t allow children of formative age to watch 18-rated films because of the possibility of them being corrupted by it. In the same way we cant allow children to have guns in this way.</p>
<p>Rights like these are for adults only.</p>
