    <description>Ok on my cheezscape_update 78 (pk) when I set my player rights to 3 it doesn&#39;t change them when I log in and when I open up a new page and get another guy on there when my main talks he has a golden crown on the other guy but not in my chat bar. What&#39;s up with that?</description>

              <p>[quote=“Tico135, post:2, topic:116093”]To change player rights, go into your Characters file and open up the file of yourself. Make sure that that person is currently logged out. Change the line that says “playerrights = 0” to “playerrights = 3” for owner status. Save the file. Compile the server and run. If you do not want to be the owner, you can change the nu,ber to one of the corrosponding numbers below:<br>
0 = Normal Player<br>
1 = Moderator<br>
2 = Administrator<br>
3 = Server Owner[/quote]</p>
<p>Not in cheezescape, pretty sure its client.java for cheeze/test</p>
