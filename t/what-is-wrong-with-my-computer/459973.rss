    <title>What is wrong with my computer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-wrong-with-my-computer/459973</link>
    <description>Hey, Can someone please tell me what is wrong with my computer? Last 2 weeks I had 104GB hard drive space and now the space is eating away for no absolute reason I only downloaded a few things taking up no more than half a gigabyte and everyday like 300MB goes missing with no downloading going on and now it is down to 90.4GB. Anyone know why hard drive space is randomly going away?

Thanks, RS PS</description>

              <p>Meh, I think I found the problem it’s programs like sony vegas and videospin I downloaded and they say it is around 200 - 300 MB when it was 2GB when I uninstalled guess that eats a ton of memory.</p>

<p>It isn’t a real-time protection, its a single use kinda deal, it expires every 10 days for security reasons, so if you need to scan again in the future just make sure to download again. You also have to be running a genuine version of Windows or it won’t work.</p>
