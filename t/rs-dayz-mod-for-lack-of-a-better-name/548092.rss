    <title>RS: DayZ Mod (for lack of a better name)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs-dayz-mod-for-lack-of-a-better-name/548092</link>
    <description>[i]No preconceived ideas of a RuneScape Private Server you have are allowed beyond this point.[/i]

[b]What is DayZ?[/b]
[url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DayZ_%28mod%29]DayZ[/url]
[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPJ37khFJWI&amp;list=PLuMTZBpxpB0cB3p3ewQT3KTdZ6szpBYSZ]Videos of DayZ[/url]

[b]It&#39;s already been done.[/b]
Back in 2012 I discovered DayZ and became infatuated. I have never played the game, but I religiously followed Frankie&#39;s series on YouTube. I started to develop a server in 2012, but my hard drive corrupted and because I moved around a lot, I lost my only backup of the game (USB).

It was after that I noticed 3 other projects that were using the DayZ concept. I have always wanted to create a server based on DayZ since 2012 and was unaware of anyone else doing the same thing.

[b]Base?[/b]
Hyperion 474 (Base: Strp Unborn by [url=http://www.rune-server.org/members/andrew/]Andrew[/url] (Derivative of: [i]Rs2-Server by [url=http://www.rune-server.org/members/scu11/]Scu11[/url] and his team[/i])).

[center][img]http://puu.sh/d81nm/57c3d0f054.png[/img][/center]

[b]Getting started[/b]
You randomly spawn around the coast line of the [url=http://puu.sh/djOaD/0312d729e3.png]developed map[/url], probably disoriented. Your first priority is to find some equipment. You will need some water before you start dying of dehydration and maybe a piece of food to keep you going.

You start off with 99 attack, strength, defence, range and hitpoints. You must train your prayer and magic as these two skills will give you the best advantage in game. The reason there is no training for other combat skills is because it would not be fair for a level 10 to keep running into a level 120. This way, everyone is equal.

[i]Starting levels[/i]
[img]http://puu.sh/djNQP/c9c97a46e4.png[/img]

It is recommended you explore and find a map, so that you can see your surrounding area and potential dangers on the minimap. You will also need a strong weapon to attack anyone (or anything) that may want to kill you. If you take damage in combat you will need a Saradomin brew to heal yourself. They are not too uncommon so keep searching until you come across one.

Pro tip. It is highly recommended you save and use as many runes as you can to train mage. If your enemy decides to run away from you it is highly advantageous to cast a binding spell on them. It may mean the difference between victory or escape. This is also beneficial if the tables turn and you are in danger of dying. A quick holding spell and you can make a swift getaway.

[b]Hunger[/b]
In real life, you can go without food longer than water. Hunger has a hidden value of 0-1200, [url=http://puu.sh/diSGI/b69702f9c0.png]but displays as a percentage[/url]. It depletes by 20 every minute which gives you 1 hour before you start to die from starvation. You can eat any type of food (fish, pies, cakes etc.) to feel less hungry. You cannot heal your hitpoints by eating food, but you can use Saradomin brews instead.

If you eat too much food you will vomit. If your hunger reaches 0%, your blood starts to drain by 46 every second. If your blood reaches 0 you start to take damage to your hitpoints, and in less than 10 seconds you will die.

[i]A player vomiting[/i]
[img]http://puu.sh/dk0F8/e4e27c31c7.png[/img]

[b]Thirst[/b]
In real life, water is your one of your main priorities when it comes to survival. Thirst has a hidden value of 0-300, [url=http://puu.sh/diSII/7b869a1dae.png]but displays as a percentage[/url]. It depletes by 30 for every 3 minutes that passes, which gives you 30 minutes before you start to die from dehydration, and therefore must consume water.

If your thirst reaches 0, your blood starts to drain by 146 every second. If your blood reaches 0 you start to take damage to your hitpoints, and in less than 10 seconds you will die.

Water replenishes your thirst (currently only works periodically like waterskins), and is dispensed by all major water outlets.

[img]http://puu.sh/ddy1T/9364edf822.png[/img][img]http://puu.sh/ddy37/f692ee3530.png[/img][img]http://puu.sh/ddy3V/00981f8f03.png[/img][img]http://puu.sh/ddy50/f04369ee73.png[/img][img]http://puu.sh/ddy5T/9c7178e0ec.png[/img][img]http://puu.sh/ddy6X/cda62d2ed7.png[/img]
[b]Vial of water:[/b] +10%
[b]Water skins:[/b] +10%
[b]Bowl of water:[/b] +30%
[b]Bucket of water:[/b] +100%
[b]Jug of water:[/b] +30%
[b]Cup of water:[/b] +10%

[i]Plans to add sterilising water in the future (use water on fire, hot water, cool down and drink).[/i]

[b]Blood[/b]
In real life the human body holds, on average, 8 pints of blood. This is equivalent to 4546 millilitres. You lose blood by having your hunger or thirst at 0%. Once your blood is 0 you lose hitpoints at a random rate of 1-10 every 2 seconds until you are dead. This currently lasts between 15-49 seconds. I wanted to keep blood and hitpoints separate.

[i]Plans to add &#39;cuts&#39; and &#39;slashes&#39; in combat where blood loss occurs.[/i]

[b]Zombies[/b]
Currently, various types of zombies spawn around the player every minute. This is just a bare bones system so far and will be gradually expanded. 

[i]TODO: zombies with multiple attack styles, player following once spawned, more advanced spawning and region clearing when player leaves region.[/i]

[img]http://puu.sh/djyQi/c6bd706b2e.jpg[/img]
[img]http://puu.sh/daTA7/146ce79751.png[/img]
[img]http://puu.sh/dbPaX/9bb1cd1532.png[/img]

[b]Rucksacks:[/b]
Around the map players can find ava&#39;s attractor and accumulator. If equipped, you can &quot;open your rucksack&quot; on the quest tab or select operate on the equipment tab. This acts as an additional inventory and gives the player an extra 10 slots to hold items. Don&#39;t let the bank interface fool you, as you will lose all items in your rucksack as if they were in your inventory.

[img]http://puu.sh/dexQK/3fa00cb882.png[/img][img]http://puu.sh/doluO/791a3cdaec.png[/img]

[b]Minimap and compass[/b]
Your minimap is blacked out unless you have a large map in your inventory. Your compass is blacked out unless you can have a sextant in your inventory. These items can be looted around the world.

[b]Heroes and Bandits system[/b]
You become a Bandit if you:
[ul][*]Kill innocent (Neutral) players
[*]Kill Heroes[/ul]

You become a Hero if you:
[ul][*]Kill Bandits[/ul]

Currently you can only distinguish Bandit players by their red skull.

[i]Showing a Bandit player.[/i]
[img]http://puu.sh/d82A3/cd31aeb36b.png[/img]

[b]Construction system (alpha)[/b]
Players can build objects, using planks, iron nails, hammers and other tools, anywhere they like. They can also destroy most interactive objects and harvest some of the materials (some materials break). Break down doors, build walls, sand pits, waterpumps, prayer altars, crates and workbenches are just a small example.

Players can chop down trees and dig up the stump/roots so the tree no longer respawns. They can replant it somewhere else if they get the seed.

[ul][*]If adding inventory amount is more than free slots, it fills up inventory and then adds ground item (fixed)
[*]Can build objects from the &quot;Open House Options&quot; button on the settings tab
[*]Can destroy objects (existing objects and constructed objects) by &quot;using&quot; hammers and other various tools on the object
[*]Can use an axe on a tree to chop it down, then if you have a spade in your inventory you can dig up the stump for the corresponding seed and root[/ul]

[b]Supply crates[/b]
The gnomes have decided that the only way to beat the zombie invasion is to provide the humans with periodic supply crate drops, using their gliders. This is a good way to get some of the best gear in game, but you may not be the only person wanting that protection. Supplies are scarce, but will you work as a team or take what you need and kill anyone in your way? It&#39;s up to you. 

They are dropped every hour, and the crate will stay for 30 minutes before being destroyed. Time intervals may change.

[img]http://puu.sh/drOPL/54e00cfdf4.png[/img]

[b]Goals[/b]
*Think of a better name
*Get a domain and create a website
*Fix up crate looting
*Fix item spawns (nulled)

[b]Other information[/b]
I am paying for the website and (eventually) server hosting myself for as long as I can support it. Development will be slow because I have a job so that I can pay for the costs.

I plan to take my time and create some real depth to the game. I want players to feel the hook and the vibe that DayZ itself provides.</description>

              <p>This can go one of two ways. Really well, or really bad. Someone was bound to take the DayZ concept and implement it into a server just like the hunger games rsps.</p>
<p>Just a few ideas and my own opinion.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use your own interfaces and perhaps some custom sprites. Using the runescape interfaces look kinda sloppy for something like this.</li>
<li>With your construction, you have to take into consideration what’s the whole point in building bases in DayZ? To hide, to hide your gear, to protect what’s in the base correct? You need to adapt your game to serve this function. As of right now you are most certainly not “hidden”, or from my best guess because you’d be able to see the player in the base on the minimap. Noclipping through the walls would probably work too and someone who is competent enough would be able to do this regardless of obfuscation and things like that.</li>
<li>I understand this is a runescape base and it’s not the arma II or DayZ engine, but on the actual game you can’t walk through zombies, which makes it a hell of a lot harder if you get boxed in by them. On runescape and servers you can just walk through them.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m liking the idea though, if this was done right this could be really fun to play  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Ok thanks, Ruby.</p>
<p>I think there are limits with my knowledge and the way the game is set up atm that certain things will need to be improvised. As a deterrent I plan to expand running energy to be your character’s overall energy. You need energy to build, energy to destroy (think of the amount of energy it would take to break down 1 wall in real life), energy to run, energy to walk.</p>
<p>Hunger and water gives you energy. But you need to sleep. No sleep makes you fatigued which drastically impacts your energy, which impacts your ability to complete tasks. That way players won’t be able to just destroy walls 1 by 1.</p>
<p>Instead of 100 running energy you may have 1000 energy for your entire body. Breaking down a wall may take several minutes in game and use up 500 energy. Including hunger, thirst and fatigue this would only mean you could destroy 1 wall and then 20 minutes later you could maybe destroy another one. This would make breaking down walls impractical after replenishing your energy. Hopefully this makes players ration their energy and creates the illusion that walls are hard to break down.</p>
<p>Just one of my other ideas.</p>

<p>I understand you’re trying to innovate and reinvent the wheel when it comes to RSPS but why not just let it die and put your time and effort into something that’s going to possibly make you money? I’m not trying to flame or anything here, it’s a genuine question. If it doesn’t attract someone who’s played DayZ almost since release then who is it going to attract?</p>

<p>I understand, but I’m not doing it for the money at the moment. I’m doing it for me. I’m doing it because it’s my passion. I have longed to do it for 2 years now and I finally have a chance.</p>
<p>I want that personal satisfaction that someone will play my server once it is released. Then I will feel like I have achieved something. I plan to do something else in the future to make some money. But want I need to do right now is create this concept of a server and make it happen.</p>
<p>If I haven’t attracted you yet then come back and see how it’s doing next year. There is still a lot of ideas I have to implement and a lot of fine tuning to do. It’s just time.</p>

<p>Surely your time as a programmer would be better spent improving something like a hardcore survival mod for A2/A3 or something like that rather than pissing about with RSPS? It just seems like a waste to me, like I said, I’m not trying to be offensive and I understand that it’s something you wanted to do but you can get the same feeling of someone playing your server or mod by using something like the Arma engine and working around a survival mod. There’s plenty to be done there, and its a much better way of learning to program than using RS.<br>

<p>Yes, the ArmA II engine has a very extensive scripting system in place for people who want to create mods and what not. I’m not sure about the ArmA III engine but definitely II has a pretty great scripting system in place.</p>
