    <title>I need help with one thing. Shouldn&#39;t be a big deal</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-one-thing-shouldnt-be-a-big-deal/217757</link>
    <description>First I have a question about a Zidddy Client. Not source, client. I want to use this base for my client. But, I want to change the Text box, and the Inventory Background. Well I probably will change the whole main face of it. And I dont know what to change for it. Its not in the sprites and what I did change in sprites wont change in game &gt;.&lt;.

Any help =)?</description>
