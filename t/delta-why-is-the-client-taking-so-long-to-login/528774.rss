    <title>[Delta]Why is the client taking so long to login?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-why-is-the-client-taking-so-long-to-login/528774</link>
    <description>Well i think this is a universal error since just recently a pi server that I was playing had the same pro and they couldn&#39;t fix it.  Here is how the problem goes.
[i][b][size=18pt]If the server is online then you start the client and try to login the client will freeze and not log you in...but theres a way around it.  Load the client and then try to login.  The client will then freeze, but after a few seconds you will get a error in connecting to the server.  Then you will run your server and you will be able to login.[/size][/b][/i]

Can someone tell me whats up with this?  I&#39;m so confused on why my client freezes when login. Its not even being hosted online.
Thanks for your help</description>
