    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-how-to-remove-pasword-encryption-pi/360028</link>
    <description>Hello, I will be showing you how to remove password encryption from your server.

This is quiet simple, but some people will still have a hard time trying to remove it.

[b]Notice[/b]: All accounts will be broken if you do this, all the passwords will have to be wiped on all accounts for your users to be able to use them again.

[b]Notice 2[/b]: This can make your accounts less secure since all passwords will be shows as what they are and not hashed or salted.

First go to directory src\server\model\players, then open up your PlayerSave Class.

Its quiet simple all you have to do is remove the basicEncrypt.

All you have to do is remove basicEncrypt so your code will look like this.

[code]
if (token.equals(&quot;character-password&quot;)) {
if (playerPass.equalsIgnoreCase(token2) || (playerPass).equals(token2)) {
playerPass = (playerPass);
} else {
return 3;
}
break;
[/code]

As you can see the code above doesn&#39;t use basicEncrypt and now your passwords will be loaded as how they are spelled like (&quot;Hello&quot;) will be (&quot;Hello&quot;) and not something like (&quot;1234h446r6ff8f8&quot;).

Now you need to remove basicEncrypt from your saveChar boolean or method, some people use a method for saving.

[code]
characterfile.newLine();
characterfile.write(&quot;character-password = &quot;, 0, 21);
characterfile.write(p.playerPass, 0, p.playerPass.length());
characterfile.newLine();
[/code]

You have just successfully removed password encryption from your PI based server, also don&#39;t remove &quot;import server.util.Misc;, it will give you errors as that class is still needed to be called in play because of the CMD print ins. I know this isn&#39;t a really big tutorial and all and I hope I explained it enough so that you will be able to understand what to do, if you need more information don&#39;t be scared and just ask. :)

<p>I made this for the people who want to remove it, if you did read my topic you would of seem that I don’t suggest doing so.

Please lower your font size, and some people don’t like encryption as they can’t get on the accounts that they think are duping or breaking the rules.<br>

<p>If you have to get on someone’s account for a problem like that, then YOU’RE the problem. It’s the developers problem for not programming it correctly. So in turn, his code gets abused.[/quote]</p>
<p>Tell that to the people who ask how to remove it all the time.</p>

<p>Also, why the fuck can’t you just generate a new hash and change their password, saving their old hash to set back to later?</p>
