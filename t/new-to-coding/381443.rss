    <description>Hey guys, 
My name is Crome and I&#39;m new to Game Coding (RSPS) --&gt;  I have coded websites before but only using Note Pad.
I was just wondering if anyone could help me out as in:

- Show/Tell me where and how to get started
- Explain to me how to code a RSPS
- Tell me about any software I&#39;ll need. (But I probably have most of it lol)
- And if anyone wants to join along in the coding :)

I will probably be working my way up from a 317 server and mastering that and then moving through all the way to a 613/614 eventually :)

PLEASE REPLY or send me a message at: packunchained@hotmail.com

(Btw, I have hosted RSPS servers but I never launched them or obviously coded them)


Thanks
-SHADOW (Crome)

&lt;Edit&gt; (4.50pm) --&gt; I am willing to pay in a small range for someone to help me get started.. &lt;Edit&gt;</description>
