    <title>PSAT/SAT scores</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/psat-sat-scores/429084</link>
    <description>Just curious as to what users on this site scored on their PSAT/SAT. I haven&#39;t taken my SAT yet, but my PSAT scores are as follows.
Critical Reading - 47
Math - 70
Writing - 59

So an overall score of 176. Hoping to get ~2000 on the final SAT. Got a lot of work to do in English. :P 

Also ITT where you want to go to college/college currently attending/college(s) you have attended. I personally want to go to MIT, but probably won&#39;t because they are so selective and you need at least a 2000 on your SAT and a composite of 32 on your ACT to get a decent chance of being admitted. My backup plan is to go to Purdue for 4 years then maybe go to MIT for 2 years and get my master in CS.</description>

<p>Though there are things that go the other way around like yours (I actually got like 15 college credits in my Freshman high school year, which was basically like a full quarter of college), including calculus, but I skipped it in HS to take it in college, as it’s much faster there.[/quote]<br>

I have no idea what a SAT is but I’m going for my interview for <a href="http://www.stevenson.ac.uk/courses/course/degree-foundation-computing-course/?fs=1" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.stevenson.ac.uk/courses/course/degree-foundation-computing-course/?fs=1</a></p>
<p>‘On successful completion, students can progress onto HND Computer Games Development, or other computing discipline, or to Degree level courses at university.’<br>
[MG]<a href="http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/4936/img00869201201121836.jpg%5B/img%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/4936/img00869201201121836.jpg[/img]</a></p>
<p>I’ll have my first Diploma before I even turn 18 :D, assuming I pass etc<br>
[/quote]Sounds somewhat like what I’m doing, except instead of getting the diploma before the degree, you start getting credit for both from doing the college classes. Like right now I’m taking three college classes, and each quarter counts as a whole year of HS credit. So basically every class you pass (2-3 months) counts for 5 college credits (and a typical 2 year degree is 90 credits here, 5 credits x 3 classes x 3 quarters x 2 years), and 1 HS credit (which is the equivalent of 2 semesters (10 months))[/quote]<br>
Ah very nice :D, hope you do well in this btw but I know you probably will haha. Ah sounds good. This is a pretty fast track course, a five month course I believe so I hope I do well :P, gonna be horrible with muuch older people though, like atm I’m with mostly 20 to late 20s but this is not a course you typically see young people doing and I’m really social so it’d be horrible for me not to be social and have friends I’d see out of the class and I can be pretty immature at times:L.</p>
<p>Its a shame yous get charged for your education(in college)! Here in Scotland we actually get paid once you turn sixteen and are in full-time education(something like $50p/w + travelling monthly+ extra costs p/w if you want it which can be up to $1600p/m in some cases, any other types of course like part-time you get charged for) and we get lots of benefits like tax reductions etc for being a Student. The same goes with Universities, and people wonder why I love Scotland so much haha.</p>

<p>It’s called Running Start here in Washington, it’s state by state, so I don’t know if yours has it (and if it did, it would be under a different name).</p>
<p>Basically you go to real college, take real college classes, etc, except it’s funded by the state (basically a two year scholarship) and your college classes count for high school credit too.</p>

<p>Though there are things that go the other way around like yours (I actually got like 15 college credits in my Freshman high school year, which was basically like a full quarter of college), including calculus, but I skipped it in HS to take it in college, as it’s much faster there.</p>

              <p>Sadly my school doesn’t offer many college courses. Best they get is dual credit for taking Calculus as a senior. And I also &lt;3 math because it has never been difficult for me. I just make little mistakes that make me facepalm once I go over which questions I got wrong. Like on the PSAT I was pretty confident I was going to get a near perfect score, but I managed to make stupid mistakes on two of the easy level math questions. Just kind of curious, how is the time frame on the actual SAT? I know that I didn’t have much leftover time on the PSAT. It was about 30 mins for 40 questions iirc.</p>

<p>I dunno how that’s set up… do you go to all 6 classes every day? Is there a lot of HW? We’re supposed to go to school 3/4 hours a day and then have 2 hours of homework for every class, so I don’t see how that’d be possible with 6 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Then again it seems your credit system is different here, almost all classes are 5 credits here <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:30, topic:429084”]You guys go on semesters there? So do you take 3 classes a quarter or what? 6 classes seems like a lot to be taking at one time at least, not sure how it’s set up…</p>
<p>And what is your major? That’s a lot of math classes. I personally hate high-level math, even if it isn’t difficult… I just don’t see the point with what I’m interested in :P[/quote]</p>
<p>We take as many courses as we want. For regular students, the limit is 18 credits, which is 4-5 classes. I’m taking 6 classes totaling 21 credits and that’s allowed for honors students.</p>
<p>And yes, haha. I’m going to be a math major! I &lt;3 math. Last semester and this coming semester were and are going to be easy, but next year will get a bit harder once I get to Number Theory, etc, but I will probably still enjoy the classes… I don’t think what I’m taking next semester is high-level math; I’m not sure, lol. I know that I’ll be in class with a lot of juniors and seniors as a freshman though. &gt;&lt;</p>
<p>There’s 2 semesters in a school year (well, duhh, ‘semestris’ haha)… My break ends tomorrow though. &lt;|3</p>
