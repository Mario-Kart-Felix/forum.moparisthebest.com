    <title>Missing Some Cache Data</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/missing-some-cache-data/541893</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently trying to cache pack the player chat models but when I speak to an npc it points out that i&#39;m still missing some for certain player hair and helmets.

These are located in the jagex cache 1 for models
Missing:
38915.gz
39894.gz - Dragon Full Helm
38941.gz - Dragon Med?
38894.gz - Rune Full Helm
These are the ones that I tested so obviously there is MUCH more than this.

There are many models for player heads and helmets so if anyone has a complete folder of these can you please link, I have a 562 IDK with 667ish items.</description>
