        <p>I guess we could call it an article? Anyhow, here it goes:</p>
<p>I’ve been reading some news today about NSA, internet companies abroad and even non-ISP (Internet Service Provider) companies such as Google [to a lesser extent] and Microsoft.<br>
It is rather upsetting to read about things that, evidently point at every human being having paranoia. “Free Speech” which I consider a blatant lie, is what internet was meant to be for.</p>
<p>Having watched the news, read articles, read the news and even seen some podcasts; I can see the internet is being constrained, drained, corrupted and abused.<br>
Companies like NSA most likely know what you, I and everyone around you have been browsing, watching, phoning, downloading, listening to, playing… And sometimes they even get images of your face.<br>
At the rate and direction things are progressing, in ten years there will be no internet; not for us normal users anyway… It will be a tool used by governments to spy on those stupid enough to use it, while those who don’t use it will be spied upon via other means.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">So what’s causing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">There are three factors to this:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Human nature</span> - both, the twisted tendencies and thoughts of normal people and the paranoia of the ‘righteous’.</li>
<li><span class="bbcode-b">Age of those ‘calling the shots’.</span></li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Behavior and ‘vocal power’ of those affected.</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b"><br>
The first factor - Human Nature:</span></span><br>
This is the cause and the issue at the same time. There are bad people in the world, there’s no denying that… There are people using the internet for malicious, horrible and despicable things;- which has created this ‘security overhead’ where everything you do is tracked, logged, harvested by companies.<br>
This means theres no freedom of speech on the internet, you say something wrong on facebook; you can quite literally get arrested for it. Whatever you say can be taken out of context and used against you at the click of someones fat fingers. All because you decided to post something from your ipad before bed.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">The second factor - Age of the government:</span></span><br>
Old people are ruining internet. There I said it, those in government don’t really know any better; they don’t know what internet does, creates, brings - What they see is most likely prawns at home and metadata provided by the aforementioned security companies telling them how internet is the source of all evil.<br>
This in effect creates these laws in your country where the internet becomes censored. In the UK, piratebay and many of its proxies is blocked… along with multiple other sites.<br>
This internet censorship is stupid and completely pointless and out of date. Why? because anything can be circumvented. Those who know what they want will find a way to do it, a pointless wall.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">The third factor - The vocal power of internet communities:</span></span><br>
Sadly, the internet community has no power vocally, people express their disgust, hatred and dislikes on the internet itself; which is something that’s nearly never taken into consideration.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">So</span> why all this spying and tracking? Because some idiots post disgusting content on the internet, some idiots perform terrorist activities on the internet, some more idiots use the internet to bring down large companies. The big issue here is the fact that the people that do all of what I just mentioned - Will always have another medium to do it within. Meaning millions will suffer for the act of a hundred people.<br>
Not only that, even right now, internet is being used for selling drugs, guns, ammunition, explosives, killings, slaves anything and everything a sick-twisted person would want. How? As I mentioned before - ‘other ways’. I will not give details, but methods exist. There is a dark side to the internet which none of us can access (that’s good), which means all this spying on our very lifestyles is completely pointless and irrelevant.<br>
Finally, with all this internet censorship, things can still easily be avoided. If you are intelligent, willing to learn and not a demented psycho with violent tendencies, I suggest you fight for your right to free internet. After all, internet is one of the greatest inventions ever. Being able to speak to people across the world, being able to share with happy moments, play games, find your lost phone, upload pictures from anywhere, watch a movie without lifting your rear end from the couch - these are fantastic things.<br>
Internet creates jobs, money, currencies, communities, happiness, networks, friendships, businesses, banks and sometimes even relationships.<br>
I guess I could harp on about human nature for hours and waste more of your time… but I was hoping to simply give you a view of what goes on - a great invention being strangled into submission by those above us.</p>
<p>Before I finish this, NSA is a company that’s based in US which has the rights to track ALL OF YOUR ACTIVITIES - ANYWHERE. They can record your full phone calls, monitor your browsing habits, your movements through the city you live in; anything at all. Many if not most people believe NSA is not a legal company, yet the US government allows for its existence. This company is very similar to that which used to reside in Area 51, nobody can dispute whether its legal or not and no information leaves its walls.<br>
Also NSA have created multiple viruses for both hardware and software that may affect your computer, this ranges from USB cables to flash drives down to even motherboards - all just to track what you do on the internet. If that’s not a sign of human paranoia, I don’t know what is. I personally hate the humanity for this very reason (not with evil intent, simply disliking the very human nature of those who don’t give a toss).</p>
<p>Final word:<br>
A senator in the US government was caught doing something by NSA, the very senator that approved NSAs activities in regards to the internet and communications; when spoken to the senator was outraged about being put under such trackers (bitten in the ass by their very own approval). In the worst case scenario these laws may be bent by the government bodies to not affect them or otherwise make them immune to such stupidity - double standards, eh.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>I mean, do you think there’s something we can do? Do you think it should stay the way it is now? Or do you feel like you’ve a genius idea? I mean, I’m pretty sure the “idiots above” could use ideas that are better than “lets spy on 7 billion people”.</p>

        <p>I’ve said this a million times before, the only idiot here is you OP. Human tendency means that we want to be protected, just don’t want to know how.<br>
For the record, I don’t condone ‘illegal’ surveillance of people.</p>
<p>edit: To expand on my point.</p>
<p>[quote=“fuzzout, post:1, topic:541632”]<span class="bbcode-b">[u]The first factor - Human Nature:</span>[/u]<br>

Whatever you say can be taken out of context and used against you at the click of someones fat fingers. All because you decided to post something from your ipad before bed.[/quote]Last I checked, threatening people in real life was a crime. Who are you to say that laws don’t apply to the internet? Your intent is irrelevant, the minute you say something that is illegal, you will be held liable for that. You have exaggerated this portion quite a lot, just to clarify swearing at people wont get you in trouble, saying stupid things will, hence my example of threatening.</p>
<blockquote>[u][b]The second factor - Age of the government:[/b][/u]

This internet censorship is stupid and completely pointless and out of date. Why? because anything can be circumvented. Those who know what they want will find a way to do it, a pointless wall.</blockquote>If you really want they can just cut the fibres which run across the world and completely shut it down. You do realize censorship is everywhere, in real life too. And these old people are generally educated, unlike you.
<blockquote>[u][b]The third factor - The vocal power of internet communities:[/b][/u]

You can't pick and match who it serves (ie 'demented psycho'). If you haven't done anything wrong, then why bother? Does it get you off knowing that you post stupid threads on moparscape? Or is it that you seek to be labelled an intellectual? It's personal gain, you are no better than the authorities.

Pretty sure they don't have the right to do any of this. The US allows its existence for [b]your[/b] safety (and the governments), let's say if on some forum a person was planning to blow up your department, the NSA would catch wind of it and stop it. It's not paranoia, given the odds, it's likely that somebody on the internet somewhere is planning something bad.
