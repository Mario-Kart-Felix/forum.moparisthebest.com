    <description>Challenges.

I personally quit them. Yesterday. I did multiple challenges, the cinnamon challenge and the gallon challenge (four times) included.
However, yesterday I did the salt and ice challenge without seeing the aftereffects -- don&#39;t [b]ever[/b] do it.

What have your guys&#39; experiences been with these sorts of things? Or just teenage stupidity in general (no drugs, idfc about your drug-related experiences).</description>

<p>Explain. Did a quick search but most came up with Sprite instead of lemonade. Also, if you consume that amount of simple food and liquid (from what I saw), you’re going to probably puke just as easily. I’d probably break just from eating the bananas…more than one and they taste weird.</p>

<p>I hate the feeling of vomiting as it is, so I don’t think I’ll ever try it. I feel sickish after drinking a couple glasses of chocolate milk lol.

I’m sure the frost bite will hurt, it’s obviously not a real one, however, since it’s using ice and salt… that shit could do some damage depending on how long it’s left on there. I thought you did this on the tug or something (oh God), I’d rather do it on the arm or something though, still though… it’s still dumb.</p>
