    <title>Need a reliable money making method</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-reliable-money-making-method/419860</link>
    <description>I&#39;d really appreciate if you guys could post some good money making methods for me? I haven&#39;t caught up with the game much and merchanting/dicing is not an option (dicing because its pointless unless you&#39;re a host, and economy is shit stable right now) and skilling is too slow.

If you have a really nice (secret) way of making money, id appreciate it if you pmed me the method :) Don&#39;t worry, I don&#39;t blab around and tell everyone. If you only pm me and don&#39;t post about it you wont be bugged by other members ;)

I have 20m worth of armor, and 10m worth of d legs, and 1.7m cash. Oh and 100 combat

Thanks!</description>

They’re not going to return that soon, the whiplash ‘crash’ has already started, after the second rise theyll stabilize. I normally would merchant but the fact that the prices update once a day the wait is absolutely terrifying to me, and flipping is just annoying with the 4 hour thing. So I bought 10m worth of d legs <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I figure its a win win because either</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bots return and I quit playing again and dont care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bots don’t return and price is guaranteed to raise</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Cant think of any good merchanting items either though (pm if you have a good one! :D)<br>

Without the bots demanding the high volume of d legs they might drop.[/quote]<br>

<p>So there was a constant flow of d legs into the game that causes the price to go from 1m-150k in not even a year, where from 2007-2010 they went from 2.9-1.2m  (over 3-4 yrs).</p>
<p>Now, being 150k, they’re excellent defense and really cheap which means pkers use them alot, and theyll be risked more often against bosses.</p>
<p>They’re more than likely going to go back to about 400-500k and stabilize.[/quote]<br>
Hmm guess you are right, I remember when D legs were more then 2m. (: Miss days when you could go behind Varrock bank and buy full guthix for 1m.</p>
