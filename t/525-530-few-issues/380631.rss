    <title>[525/530] Few issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/525-530-few-issues/380631</link>
    <description>So starting a 525/530 serevr everything is going well until a few brick walls shoot up... Such as:

 Character customization (where you can change your hair and things) interface works like a dream, except when U click confirm, then it changes for a minute and goes right back to the default style (I believe its a save issue but can&#39;t seem to resolve it)...
 
 Npc following, was working with a following.java (failed) :P but when you attack an npc, it targets you no problem.. But it will not follow you or come after you in combat... Kinda confused on why this happens myself...

 My crystal bow doesn&#39;t know where to equip itself... All of the proper variables are set, but for some reason, the crystal bow does not equipped...

 These three questions are all I have but I don&#39;t know the requirements to fix them... Any help is appreciated.. Thanks.</description>
