    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-error-need-help/238357</link>
    <description>ok i have my client and it was working fine yesterday but now there is something wrong. The client gets to the line were it says loading client but it says this in my command prompt:

Error: loaderror Starting up Client 20




and also it doesnt load and this comes up on the client:


Sorry, an error has occered whilst loading Thatpur3scape.

To fix this try the following(in order):

1: Try closing ALL open web-browser windos, and reloading
2: Try cloearing your web-browsing cache from tools&gt;internet options
3: Try using a different game world
4: Try rebooting your computer
5: Try selecting a different version of Java from the play game menu









Can anyone please help me?</description>
