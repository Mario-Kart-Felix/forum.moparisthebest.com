    <description>Last few weeks I&#39;ve been enjoying it. Though, I thought there&#39;s no way all these coincidences can happen, example:

Hammoud gets out of his car, then the car falls of the cliff like 3 seconds later. 

So, I thought I would search it up, as much of a good show it is, I just hate scripted shows.

This is Infact Scripted, and most say &quot;poorly Scripted&quot;. Now... that basically kills the only show I ever like about cars...

Here&#39;s a quote of another forum:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the whole thing is scripted. Did you know that they don&#39;t use their real names? James May is actually Colin Daniels; Jeremy Clarkson is Gordon McIntosh and Richard Hammond is Brett Dagger.

They all went to the same drama school in Poland and regularly appeared in plays, pantos and court rooms. Gordon shared the stage with the great Lord Olivier in late seventies. As well as selling fruit in the market in EastEnders during the 1980s, Gordon could often be seen in the background ruining various outside broadcasts. Colin mainly did Rep work, but was fortunate enough to sleep with the right people and has never looked back.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>I don’t know where you’ve read this ‘scripted’ shit from but the shows humour is only scripted a little, which is blatantly obvious.</p>
<p>Also that comment on them having different aliases is total bullshit, you honestly think Jeremy Clarkson could act? Also, during the late 70’s Jeremy was trying to pursue a career in Journalism, he most definitely wasn’t in Poland during those times, he was still getting an education.</p>

<p>It may or may not be scripted, but I think the above paragraph about the names is complete bullshit, unless the original writer of it, or anybody else, can prove me otherwise.</p>
