[b]P.S[/b] please be nice, its my first server, and iv enjoyed playing other players server long enought. I also hae already went so far thats there is no turning back so please help me. Also can you be nice? Please dont flame me or tell me I shouldnt make a server, Only put guides or step by step information. Otherwise the rest is just SPAM to me.</description>

              <p>Did u extract allstarscape? if yes then click runserver and ur source is up. turn on your no-ip host.To edit u might want to see wat u wana edit then it wud be better if u visit ur source. After uve done that then go to client.java file and hit ctrl+f then put the stuff u wana edit like “Server owner is Mod Allstar”. u can change that and put ur name in… After all your editing u might wana compile it so that the changes take place. Go to your source files and look for a compiler or compile batch file. Click it and follow the instructions given like press c for compiling. ull need JDK 6.6-10 for the compiler to work. Now u have to set ur environmental variables, U can look them up from server tutorials its the first stickied topic in   server tutorials section. I hope this helped u…</p>
<p>P.S: Allstarscape is silab, im sure u know wat tht means. :rolleyes:[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 04, 2008, 10:20:53 am[/size][hr]hope this helped…</p>
