    <description>ok... so I have been asking to know how to add commands well i went into my commands file and started looking at the commands... they start out like this [code]
if (playerCommand.startswith(&quot;command&quot;))[/code] and the way people have been telling me to add them is different.. but i just started looking at the way they started out so i just started to understand how to add them.. and i thoguth i could add one however i was having like 4 errors when i compiled... so here is what i tried to add and here is my errors

EDIT: i narrowed it down to one error here is what the code is now 
[code]if (playerCommand.startswith(&quot;(home)&quot;) &amp;&amp; (c.playerRights &gt;= 0)) {
                        c.getPA().startTeleport((3086),3493)&quot;modern&quot;);
                        
                }  [/code]

and here is what the error is
