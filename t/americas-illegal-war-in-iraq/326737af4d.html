Save the ‘there’s other reasons for the war’ bullshit. There is no legitimate reason for the war. America went in there and fucked up.</p>
<p>They expected the Iraqis would welcome them but that’s not what happened.</p>
<ul>
<li>4.5k marines died and 20k were injured</li>
<li>7k contractors died and who knows how many were injured</li>
<li>trillions of dollars lost protecting one of the world’s most corrupt governments</li>
<li>world economy was/is severely damaged</li>
<li>America became more fucked up than it ever was, health care etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Americans fucked up in their wars and they’re too proud to admit it. Now America is slowly retreating from Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Mission failed, fuck off.</p>

        <p>The war in Iraq was “Necessary” but it was far from legitimate. It was illegal under international law. The CIA put Saddam into power in 1963 (this is not a crazy conspiracy, it is fact). The war was necessary because of conditions created beforehand by the United States and the capitalist system. Britain created Iraq when she conquered the area from the Ottoman Turks around the turn of the century. Iraq’s strategic value (read:the exploitation of it’s natural resources) was always more important than it’s sovereignty to the imperial powers which dominated it.</p>

<p>When the United States led coalition entered Iraq there certainly were voices raised in the US media that expressed a view that the majority of the Iraqi population would welcome the"Liberators". Are you implying that every US citizen held this view? Many Americans did not support the invasion and did not believe the invasion would be welcomed by the Iraqis. “We” don’t do anything to anyone. “We” are not our government(!). If our government commits illegal activity, then we protest it and speak up and tell people why its wrong, but we can’t be held responsible personally.</p>

<p>9/11 had nothing to do with Iraq and neither wars were ever ‘legalized’.[/quote]<br>
Banned? Ha. You’re posts look just as retarded to me as mine do to you.</p>
<p>What are we classifying as legal? The UN never sanctioned it but we had a coalition of 5-10 nations that felt it was the right thing to do. The war was legal to the US and at the time about 90% of the world agreed there was something going on over there. If it was such a crime to go over why haven’t we been kicked out of the UN or told to stop for the past 9 years?</p>
<p>The Iraqis were not resisting. The resisters were people that were part of Saddam’s regime. You can’t be sure that the general public does not want us there, because if they show support and someone who is part of the regime hears them, he/she and their family could become a target. And if they support the other side then they could potentially be a target of ours. Its a no-win situation and im sure they wouldn’t want to be in the way of the worlds most powerful military. Both sides have the power to kill anyone they choose, so most of the public just go on their way and stay neutral. What about the first Iraq election where Saddams own citizens voted that he should be hanged? All the resistance you see everywhere is the people we are trying to keep out of iraq.</p>
<p>If i was arguing on your side it would be a breeze because of the massive load of people out there with this completely inaccurate mindset that dominates every google result you could find with their retarded rant blogs and factless statements.</p>
<p>And again, why do you sympathize with these people? You defend them like you live there which im sure if you did your view would be different.</p>

<p>This is a fallacious statement, using the fallacy <span class="bbcode-i">post hoc ergo propter hoc</span>. Literally this translates to ‘after this, therefore on account of this’ and in this case it consists of assuming that because America hasn’t “been kicked out of the UN or told to stop for the past 9 years”, America isn’t committing a crime.</p>

You can’t be sure that the general public does not want us there, because if they show support and someone who is part of the regime hears them, he/she and their family could become a target. And if they support the other side then they could potentially be a target of ours. Its a no-win situation and im sure they wouldn’t want to be in the way of the worlds most powerful military. Both sides have the power to kill anyone they choose, so most of the public just go on their way and stay neutral. What about the first Iraq election where Saddams own citizens voted that he should be hanged?</p>

</aside>
<p>Do you have proof of the resisters being part of Saddam’s regime? Also, who conducted that poll where the citizens voted that Saddam should be hanged? Who reported the results? Remember the quote, “It is enough that the people know there was an election. The people who cast the votes decide nothing. The people who count the votes decide everything.”</p>

        <p>If i sound attacking i am in no way intending to, and if i am, i am taking shots at no one.</p>
<p>In some nations eyes we could be committing a crime, in all the nations currently taking part in the wars overseas it is not.</p>
<p>The election voted for a council (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Iraqi_Criminal_Tribunal">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Iraqi_Criminal_Tribunal</a>) which later found Saddam guilty and executed.

        <p>Frell, it’s great that you support the good work that the United States is doing building hospitals and schools and attempting to create a more safe and just society in Iraq, and you might be able to find figures which show the life of the average citizen has improved under the US sanctioned government. Does this mean that the war is not mainly about oil? Does it mean that that the war was legal? Does it mean that George Bush is not a war criminal?</p>
<p>Alan Greenspan, former head of the US Federal Reserve, stated that the War in Iraq is largely about <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article2461214.ece" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">oil</a>.</p>
<p>Considering the history of imperialism in the region and the involvement of the United States in regime changes in the Middle East in more recent times, I don’t think there is a way to reasonably support the position that the United States is on some kind of humanitarian mission, especially since Saddam Hussein was put into power by a CIA coup.</p>
<p>Was the war illegal?</p>
<blockquote>Shortly before the outbreak of hostilities, UN Secretary General stated that the use of force without Council endorsement would "not be in conformity with the Charter" and many legal experts now describe the US-UK attack as an act of aggression, violating international law.</blockquote>
<p>Is Bush guilty of warcrimes?</p>
<blockquote>On February 7, 2002, President Bush signed an order denying Geneva Conventions protection to detainees in the War on Terrorism. From that point on, the word went out to members of the U.S. military, to agents of the CIA and other government agencies, and to private contractors involved in interrogations and detentions that they could use techniques and punishments which were illegal according to U.S. law. For example, it was now acceptable to cover a prisoner's face with cellophane or cloth and pour water on him so that he thought he was suffocating to death. According to the Bush administration, this form of mock execution, known as waterboarding, which was considered illegal during the Vietnam War, was no longer classified as torture.
<p>At every level, from the highest officers and civilian officials to low-ranking enlisted personnel, Americans passed on the order to engage in practices that broke U.S. law. In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme Court ruled that detainees in the War on Terrorism really are covered by the Geneva Conventions and, by extension, by the U.S. War Crimes Act. Now dozens, if not hundreds, of U.S. soldiers, CIA agents and private contractors are confronting the fact that they violated the War Crimes Act at Guantánamo, in Afghanistan, in Iraq and at “black sites” around the world. Considering that the Pentagon admits that at least 35 detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan have been murdered by their guards, many of these Americans could face the death penalty.</p>

<p>Does it really matter if the War in Iraq is illegal or which laws were broken during the Bush administration? Aren’t these diversions from reaching an understanding of the real reasons for the war?</p>

<blockquote>"Now let me explain a few things about the dollar. Between the end of World War II and August 15, 1971, the US dollar was pegged to gold, with one troy ounce of gold (around 31.1 grams) being worth $35. Meaning, the US was ready to convert dollars to gold at any point of time. This ensured the dollar became the international reserve currency with other countries carrying out trade with each other in dollars because it was convertible into gold.All this led to a lot of dollar pile-upsacross the world. Also, the US itself printed a lot of dollars to bankroll the Cold War and the Vietnam War.
<p>This led to a situation where more and more countries started to exchange their dollars for gold. The amount of gold that the US government had was not infinite. So, on August 15, 1971 then-President Richard Nixon decided the US would no longer convert dollars into gold."<br>
…</p>
<p>Till August 15, 1971, the US dollar was essentially gold. After that, it became a concept, an idea or just a piece of plain paper which had the backing of the world’s biggest superpower nation.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But what one must remember is that by taking dollar off from the gold standard, the US had the ability to print as many dollars as they wanted to, as they did not have to bother about having to face the risk of converting those dollars into gold.</p>
<p>And given their addiction to the so-called American way of life, they would print as many dollars as required to pay Opec’s price. Opec of course, understood this. If what you are earning is paper, then you’d rather have more of it than less of it. Once the US was ready to pay, the rest of the world followed."</p>

<blockquote>The dollar is the de facto world reserve currency: the US currency accounts for approximately two thirds of all official exchange reserves. More than four-fifths of all foreign exchange transactions and half of all world exports are denominated in dollars. In addition, all IMF loans are denominated in dollars.
...
If on the other hand OPEC were to decide to accept euros only for its oil (assuming for a moment it were allowed to make this decision), then American economic dominance would be over. Not only would Europe not need as many dollars anymore, but Japan which imports over 80% of its oil from the Middle East would think it wise to convert a large portion of its dollar assets to euro assets (Japan is the major subsidiser of the US because it holds so many dollar investments). The US on the other hand, being the world's largest oil importer would have to run a trade surplus to acquire euros. The conversion from trade deficit to trade surplus would have to be achieved at a time when its property and stock market prices were collapsing and its domestic supplies of oil and gas were contracting. It would be a very painful conversion.</blockquote>

<p>I wonder what the fuck you are talking about, Frell, when you say the war “was” partly about protecting “our” oil. I don’t want to say that <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> don’t know what you’re talking about, but <span class="bbcode-b">I</span> don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
