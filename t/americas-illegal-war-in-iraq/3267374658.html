<p>Damn, and that is from 2006, so I’m sure it has went up by a lot since then.  I still can’t find any proof that we have taken any oil at all, but we would have to take a VERY large amount to even make it worth the while wouldn’t we?  So basically the argument that America ‘did it for the oil’ is complete bullshit?</p>

Pretty much, we purchase the oil from those fields anyway, along with many European countries. I’ve met people who think we’re there for <span class="bbcode-b">more</span> oil, which yes is complete bullshit. Im sure if we needed oil that badly, we definitely wouldn’t go and spend 1.8B a week and LIVES trying to get it. There would probably be a big thing going on against the people who don’t want us to drill here.</p>
<p>So Saddam is dead, This clearly is not for <span class="bbcode-b">more</span> oil, and its not an act of imperialism. SOMETHING must be up. Going over to defend the oil fields is a possibility, but that threat has probably vanished once Saddam was hanged, it was his plan to control the oil supply.</p>

Yes you guys spent trillions in Iraq but not all of it was necessarily directed at helping the Iraqis. In fact I’m pretty sure most of the money was spent on military equipment.</p>
<p>Iraq doesn’t need any money anyway. It has enough oil to fund itself. The only reason the economy was so damaged was because of the 12 year economic sanctions the people had to face. The sanctions were so bad that children with leukemia were treated with Panadol.</p>
<p>By the way Frell, I hope you realize that you sound like an idiot. No one was allowed to buy oil from Iraq before the war because of the sanctions. So to say that destroying the wells would devastate the economy is very unintelligent on your behalf because Iraq’s oil wasn’t even part of the world economy until just recently. Stop waffling shit please.</p>

        <p>Interesting points raised. I agree with Mopar – there has to be a deeper truth behind America’s occupation than the alleged desire for oil; the amount of money spent daily could buy plenty of oil, so there’s no justification for pissing that money away on a war when it would easily buy the oil.</p>
<p>I’m curious about which allies America is aiding with its military presence in the region, given that the Iraqis apparently don’t want them there.</p>
<p>That was also a fair point raised with regards to Africa too. If not oil, then what? Supporting an ally or not, many people condemn the US government’s decision to go to war in Iraq/Afghanistan (although, rightfully, they support the troops that have been deployed).<br>
If it really is a matter of ‘Team America, World Police’, why aren’t forces committed to other equally impoverished and war-torn areas?</p>
<p>I think, ultimately, the war effort is there to reduce the effects of the global recession.<br>
Nothing stimulates an economy like a good old war.</p>

</aside>
<p>It was of a huge benefit to Israel. Iraq was one of the strongest Arab countries in the region, and given that Israel was founded on Arab land, the Arabs obviously intend to take that land back. America’s government is heavily Christian and it’s part of Christian belief that a Jewish state must exist in the holly land before their awaited messiah will return. Also, AIPAC - the American Jewish lobby - is very influential on the decisions of American diplomats because it technically funds most if not all of them. I think the war was entirely aimed at preserving Israel’s presence.</p>

The recession only ever came after the war. Economically speaking, the war only devastated America.</p>

<p>Damn, and that is from 2006, so I’m sure it has went up by a lot since then.  I still can’t find any proof that we have taken any oil at all, but we would have to take a VERY large amount to even make it worth the while wouldn’t we?  So basically the argument that America ‘did it for the oil’ is complete bullshit?[/quote]<br>
Motherfucker, that is a lot of money.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:25, topic:326737”]Interesting points raised. I agree with Mopar – there has to be a deeper truth behind America’s occupation than the alleged desire for oil; the amount of money spent daily could buy plenty of oil, so there’s no justification for pissing that money away on a war when it would easily buy the oil.</p>
<p>I’m curious about which allies America is aiding with its military presence in the region, given that the Iraqis apparently don’t want them there.</p>
<p>That was also a fair point raised with regards to Africa too. If not oil, then what? Supporting an ally or not, many people condemn the US government’s decision to go to war in Iraq/Afghanistan (although, rightfully, they support the troops that have been deployed).<br>
If it really is a matter of ‘Team America, World Police’, why aren’t forces committed to other equally impoverished and war-torn areas?</p>
<p>I think, ultimately, the war effort is there to reduce the effects of the global recession.<br>
Nothing stimulates an economy like a good old war.[/quote]<br>
There had to be something done in the Middle-East in terms of peace-keeping, and I think they went there for a fairly justified reason but I have a feeling noone wanted it to end up like this, and now they’re fighting back (can’t blame them really), and if the Spetsnaz failed who the fuck else could l0l</p>

        <blockquote>Bush decided to invade Iraq in April 2001, [b]six months before September 11th,[/b] and the official reason was to improve Western access to Iraqi oil.
<p>[ul][li][sub]“President Bush’s Cabinet agreed in April 2001 that ‘Iraq remains<br>
a destabilising influence to the flow of oil to international markets<br>
from the Middle East’ and because this is an unacceptable risk to<br>
the US ‘military intervention’ is necessary.”[sup][1][/sup][/sub][/li][/ul]<br>
The decision for military action had nothing to do with 9/11, the waron terrorism, the UN weapons inspections, weapons of mass destruction,Iraqi human rights, or any of the factors that the US government wouldlike you to believe are the true motives for war.</p>
<p>The only people who will benefit from the war on Iraq are the elitewealthy oil men who finance Bush’s election campaigns, and people likeBush who have huge personal investments in the oil industry. Oilcompany profits have already increased by fifty percent this yearbecause of the war, and the invasion hasn’t even started yet!</p>

        <p>Yeah, what he said.</p>
<p>For those of you saying it ‘wasn’t about oil’, “The respected Petroleum Economist Magazine estimates that there may be as many as 200 bbl of oil in Iraq” (<a href="http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2003/0512globalenvironment_luft.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2003/0512globalenvironment_luft.aspx</a>), at $50/bl (massive under estimate, real price is ~$70 and going up) that’s a trillion dollars, which is a fair chunk more than the cost spent on the invasion so far (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_cost_of_the_Iraq_War" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_cost_of_the_Iraq_War</a> if you believe those estimates).</p>
<p>Furthermore, Iraq’s oil production at 2bbl/year means that America has potentially secured a 100 year supply for itself, or as global supplies dwindle, an <span class="bbcode-b">enormous</span> cash cow - if the price of oil does keep rising as predicted, the nation in control of supplies will secure a massive profit.</p>

Well they’re not gonna just take it, that’s just stealing, that’d be pushing it a bit even for the US. They’ve just secured it, I imagine they’ll use their military, financial and political leverage in the country to bend them in the future like they did to Britain after WW2 (remember, america ‘graciously’ loaned money to the uk so it could save the world from the nazis, and then you used it as political leverage for the next 50 years).</p>
<p>Also, QUICKLY FRELL WE MUST GO TO THE OIL FIELDS ASAP AND PROTECT THEM IN CASE ANY OF THE ALLAH SEEPS IN!!!111111111111111 Wtf are you talking about, oil fields don’t need to be ‘defended’, they’re buried like a thousand metres under the fucking ground.

Everyone is in agreement that there is a shitload of oil in Iraq.  I am disputing that the United States has taken ANY of it during this war.  I still haven’t seen any proof that they have.<br>

Well they’re not gonna just take it, that’s just stealing, that’d be pushing it a bit even for the US. They’ve just secured it, I imagine they’ll use their military, financial and political leverage in the country to bend them in the future like they did to Britain after WW2 (remember, america ‘graciously’ loaned money to the uk so it could save the world from the nazis, and then you used it as political leverage for the next 50 years).[/quote]</p>
<p>So the USA spent trillions of dollars to ‘secure’ a few oil fields that they can then buy oil from at a discount over the next 50 years?  It would have been much cheaper just to buy oil someplace else and save the trillions of dollars and lives wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>I’m a Christian and that is not a part of ANY Christian belief that I am aware of, certainly not the Roman Catholic Church.  I wonder where that came from?  It sounds like some good Muslim propaganda, I don’t really know though.[/quote]<br>
I’m sorry for generalizing. I really did think it was part of your faith. However some Christians are Zionist Christians:</p>
<blockquote>Christian Zionism can be defined as Christian support for the Zionist cause — the return of the Jewish people to its biblical homeland in Israel. It is a belief among some Christians that the return of Jews to Israel is in line with a biblical prophecy, and is necessary for Jesus to return to Earth as its king. These Christians are partly motivated by the writings of the Bible and the words of the prophets. However, they are also driven to support Israel because they wish to “repay the debt of gratitude to the Jewish people for providing Christ and the other fundamentals of their faith,” and to support a political ally, according to David Brog, author Standing With Israel: Why Christians Support the Jewish State.</blockquote>

You could look at it like an investment, the USA has poured say $1trillion into the country to secure oil for the next xx years, where the oil is at worst case worth the money they put in.</p>
<p>If they’d spent the trillion dollars on oil elsewhere, they’d just get some short-term oil supplies. As prices go up, they’d get less and less oil for their money. Worst case, countries facing dwindling supplies and start hoarding oil and America’s already got 10%-ish percent of the world’s supply under it’s thumb.</p>
