    <description>So they went to war on the premise of &#39;WMDs&#39; and &#39;Democracy&#39;...

Few years on, all I see is more oil. George Bush should be hanged as a war criminal.

              <blockquote>- The theory where Saddam wouldn't trade oil in American currency as suggested by PaulT. Although I thought since Iraq was under economic sanctions, it wasn't allowed to trade it's oil anyway?</blockquote>
<blockquote>In November 2000, Iraq began selling its oil in euros. Iraq's oil for food account at the UN was also in euros and Iraq later converted its $10 billion reserve fund at the UN to euros. Several other oil producing countries have also agreed to sell oil in euros-Iran, Libya, Venezuela, Russia, Indonesia, and Malaysia (soon to join this group). In July 2003, China announced that it would switch part of its dollar reserves into the world's emerging "reserve currency" (the euro).</blockquote>
<blockquote>The unprovoked "shock and awe" attack on Iraq was to serve several economic purposes: (1) Safeguard the U.S. economy by re-denominating Iraqi oil in U.S. dollars, instead of the euro, to try to lock the world back into dollar oil trading so the U.S. would remain the dominant world power-militarily and economically. (2) Send a clear message to other oil producers as to what will happen to them if they abandon the dollar matrix. (3) Place the second largest oil reserve under direct U.S. control. (4) Create a subject state where the U.S. can maintain a huge force to dominate the Middle East and its oil. (5) Create a severe setback to the European Union and its euro, the only trading block and currency strong enough to attack U.S. dominance of the world through trade. (6) Free its forces (ultimately) so that it can begin operations against those countries that are trying to disengage themselves from U.S. dollar imperialism-such as Venezuela, where the U.S. has supported the attempted overthrow of a democratic government by a junta more friendly to U. S. business/oil interests.</blockquote>

              <p>IIRC Saddam threatened Isreal with missiles and i think Iran is still doing it atm. The WMD’s is still unknown. Saddam gave the UN inspectors limited access during the inspections and only let them see what he wanted them to see. But to this day i haven’t seen it disproved or proved.</p>
<p>The thought of spending billions a week for 7 years for oil overseas is ridiculous, that couldn’t have been the primary motive.</p>
<p>And then theres the threat Saddam posed to the worlds oil supply, it wouldn’t completely cut it off due to extra wells but economies would slow down drastically.</p>
<p>And yes there were sanctions when he was suspected of crimes etc. Him selling oil was an easy way for him to supply his military with weapons and more equipment.</p>
<p>Nowa days the government cant say anything because of the internet. Its not like when the president tells everyone during a speech in the 1700’s, people in Europe will know about it within the next couple of hours.</p>

              <p>The dollar is one bitch of a currency. Oil is almost exclusively traded in with dollars. When the oil traders stop using the dollar, the US will collapse. But take a look at the national debt of the US. Where does the money come from? That’s right, the Middle-East. And China. So the oil-Sheiks would love to drop the Dollar, but that would mean that their investments in the US will become worthless. So they won’t. The Middle-East is one big puppet state.</p>
<p>My previous statement is incomplete. Not only the Middle-East and China have investments in the US, every country with a decent economy has an interest in the Dollar. It’s like a Siamese twin brother, a sick one. We want to get rid of our sick brother, but it will cripple us severely.</p>

              <p>Saddam was a US installed dictator. Yes, he was a threat to the livelihood and safety of his own people, but historically the US has no problem supporting brutal dictators. It is only when they start to threaten the economic interests of the US that a problem arises. To defend the “War on Terrorism” as a humanitarian mission is to ignore the economic and political tensions which continue to create conflict in the world and blame the misadventures of the military industrial complex on religious extremists. There must be a paradigm shift away from cost/benefit analysis and the “Us Versus Them” attitude that characterizes modern capitalist society and towards an understanding philanthropic progressive worldview.</p>

              <p>Theres so many articles out there of people cleverly puzzling all this together and you don’t know who to believe anymore. If we were in it for the oil then so is Britain, Australia and all the other countries fighting. When Saddam lit the oil wells on fire it made gas prices shoot up for months, if he would have shot the missiles we gave to him years earlier much worse could’ve happened. All the supreme countries got their oil from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia at the time (Still do IIRC) and no one wanted the national threat of having their oil supply cut. What Saddam did at the time and what he was capable of doing near the invasion was such a threat to national security that we had to go over there.</p>
<p>If you read the message i linked you to, Saddams goal when he invaded Kuwait was to take control of the worlds oil supply. When Kuwait refused and asked for the US to help, the US drove him out (Operation Desert Storm, i say again). And on his way out he had the Iraq military light the wells on fire.</p>
<p>@ the OP statement, it doesn’t matter. No country has any Legal authority over another but the UN was created to solve stuff as humanly as possible to prevent disputes turning into wars, and you do not have to be in the UN. As i’ve already said, it was legal to the US and all the other countries that invaded with the US.</p>
<p>You do realize that its people with your similar logic (not an attacking statement :P) are the ones who will not allow drilling on our own soil? We have so much untouched oil under our country it would last us for hundreds of years. Why would we spend so much money going all the way overseas for years when it would have been easier just to start drilling?</p>

<p>Yes, “We” are spending shitloads of money to help “These people”. However according to OP this thread is about the rational for going to war, not the humanitarian efforts of the occupying force. Justifying the invasion by referring to these efforts is not cogent. Were weapons of mass destruction a red herring? Can you refute the evidence I have provided which demonstrates that oil is the driving factor in US Middle East policy?</p>
