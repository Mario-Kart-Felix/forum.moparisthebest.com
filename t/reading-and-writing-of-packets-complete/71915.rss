    <title>Reading and writing of packets [complete]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reading-and-writing-of-packets-complete/71915</link>
    <description>Following the example of rscd i have finally finished the reading and writing of packets and it does work sucesfully,  however.  the update server idea needs some rearranging because the mina package isnt very nice about inputstreams and output streams.  However on a positive note, if we skill the whole update server until later on we can work on getting some basic game functions done.  The implimenting of the login server, update server, chat server, will not be done until the very end.  This way we can focus on the meat and potatoes and not be bogged down by things that are not 100 percent nessesary.</description>
