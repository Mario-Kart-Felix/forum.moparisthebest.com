[/quote]</p>
<p>Lol turkish idiot first of all you probably done more rs2 shit then rsclassic so stand currect.<br>
second, I never been loyal to rsc I have a life you fool.<br>
third , RSC is dead so you have to think outside the box. its like your room you are there 24/7 because you don’t have a rreal life, but sometimes you need to step out to go to the bathroom.[/quote]<br>
You really think people in moparscape don’t have life?<br>
Mark gore has a great life tbh. I’ve stalked him on facebook few times.<br>
So do I, Can’t say same at you.<br>
Just leave or keep your mouth shut, you aren’t making any valid statements.</p>

              <p>Just to go off on a slight tangent here. To everyone who doesn’t like RS2 due to the graphics when it came out, have you actually seen them now? I don’t know how anyone can’t like the HD graphics. The only fault I have with them is that the player models still look fucking gay, but given someone with a bit of milkshake 3D experience, could turn into really decent models.</p>

i disagree, 99% of the time you are looking at the game engine (better graphics in rs2, far different gameplay). DQ just has an outline/border that’s not close to rs2, just far away from RSC</p>
