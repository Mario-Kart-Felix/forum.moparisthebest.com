The time has come. The Two Worlds is in need of experienced beta testers that are able to find exploits and other in-game flaws. As a beta tester you will receive in-game compensation upon the official server release. We appreciate your time and effort. Remember this is a Beta mode and not everything is going to be working to its full potential. That is why we need you all, the community, to help us better our developmental stage. Thank You

[b][size=24pt]Introduction[/size][/b]
[i]As a intermediate programmer, i have always looked for ways of challenging myself so that i would be able to call myself a rsps programmer. Over the past year i have been studying programming and learning how to become a real programmer. And now with this project i am going to test what i have learned. I have played many servers over the years, some have bored me, some made me quite addicted, but most of them felt the same. With this server i am hoping to create something unique. Something that will hopefully be able to be remembered as a good server.[/i]

<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=24pt]Introduction[/size]</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">As a intermediate programmer, i have always looked for ways of challenging myself so that i would be able to call myself a rsps programmer. Over the past year i have been studying programming and learning how to become a real programmer. And now with this project i am going to test what i have learned. I have played many servers over the years, some have bored me, some made me quite addicted, but most of them felt the same. With this server i am hoping to create something unique. Something that will hopefully be able to be remembered as a good server.</span><br>
