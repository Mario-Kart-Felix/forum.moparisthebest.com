              <p>im sure theres nothing wrong with the one you have. if you changed the jdk and it still wont compile or run the make sure its not set to like program files (x86), or vice versa…if you have (x86) make sure it is set to that.</p>
<p>if thats not the issue then you need to set your variables…google environmental variables and it will teach you how to set them</p>
