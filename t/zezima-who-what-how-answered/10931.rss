    <title>Zezima who? what? how? answered!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/zezima-who-what-how-answered/10931</link>
    <description>i read a post earlier about zezima and the people where argueing about Zezima being a boy or a girl and if he cheats or not, it kind of got me annouyed so i made this post to kinda clear a couple of things up!


I want to make this perfectly clear,
Zezima is Not a he nor a She!!!

zezima is a Family Char, what does this mean?

well, this means that a whole family plays runescape on the same char.
Btw its a family of 5!!

mother(40ish), father(40ish), son(18), daughter(15), son(11)

So Now you know that Zezima is a Family of 5 who play runescape on the same Char.

now you ask did he cheat?
well, the answer is YES!!!! your stupid if you dont think he cheated but, he cheated before jagex got really heavy on macroing, so he got all his levels up then stopped macroing (which is why they cant/wont ban him)


Anymore questions about Zezima?
if you want to know anything else about Zezima then just pm me!

thanks

<p>Anyway People making websites and calling themselfs zezima is just sad,</p>
<p>I remember when i played rs, some kid started saying ‘I dream about zezima, that he came and give me a whip and a dragon chain, he also let me share his account, But then i woke up and cried because it wasnt true’</p>
<p>He was like 11 i think lololol</p>
