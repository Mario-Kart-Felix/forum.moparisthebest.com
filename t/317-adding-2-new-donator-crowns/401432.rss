    <title>317 Adding 2 new Donator crowns</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-adding-2-new-donator-crowns/401432</link>
    <description>Ok, so the other day some people on my server requested that you can have more then 1 color of donor symbol, so I made 3, Green, blue and red. How exactly do I add them too? I played around a lil bit already, but I kept getting some erros, I also followed a Tut by GalkonsPride, but that gave me errors too... If anyone knows a Tutorial, or has any kind of help please post!</description>
