    <title>Client Cannot Display 120/120 All Skills In Skills Tab - Only Dungeoneering</title>

I cannot think of where to look to allow all skills to [i]DISPLAY IN THE SKILLS TAB AS 120/120.
EVEN THOUGH MY MAX LEVEL IS 120 EVERY SKILL, IT SHOWS 120/99 IN THE SKILLS TAB.[/i]

My server recognizes that my skills are all level 120, and if you gain enough XP in a skill besides dungeoneering, you can still level to 120, but each time it just shows 100...101...102...103.../99, AND you cannot see how much [i]XP IS REMAINING TILL NEXT LEVEL, WHILE DUNGEONEERING YOU CAN.[/i]

[b]The client doesn&#39;t display in the Skills Tab all my skills as 120/120. But my skills are actually 120/120, the server recognizes it, the client cannot display it.[/b]

The problem is: In the SKILLS TAB, it only shows 120/99, because the client doesn&#39;t know how to display any higher values than 99 for all the skills besides dungeoneering, because it has the tracker setup so when you level to max it doesn&#39;t show the next level anymore, well, dungeoneering can go up to 120 before it does that, and every skill 100+ displays the xp remaining before level, but other skills don&#39;t display that. Once it hits 99 then it removes the remaining xp till level...

So, that specifically, the displaying of the client, in the SKILLS TAB, showing your SKILLS LEVELS, only displays x/99 max for all skills except dungeoneering.

How can I locate in the client where in the SKILLS TAB IT TELLS THE CLIENT TO SHOW THE XP REMAINING TILL LEVEL, because then I can make the dungeoneering one, which allows 120/120 to be displayed as well as shows the box with the XP TILL LEVEL. Other skills does not show that after 99, and only displays x/99, like mentioned.</description>
