    <title>My Project! Looking For A Team!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-project-looking-for-a-team/169335</link>
    <description>Hey Everyone!
I am looking for a team.
I want to make a silab version. I am starting from testscape but i am stripping all the retarded stuff it has, right now by myself.

I am looking for at least a 5 man team.
-Project Manager/Owner (Filled - Me) 
-Head Coder/Coder (Open)
-Dedicated hoster/Server box (Open)
-Website Builder (Open)
-Client Coder (Open)

I know there is no name to the server or the project. I believe thats what the group should decide on.
I am going to set up a ftp server only for the members of my team. This will allow them to access the files and post updates frequently.



I prefer that you have a microphone for the computer. [/COLOR]We will be using a program called Teamspeak for our discussion. You must have a yahoo or msn/hotmail.
