    <description>[center]Hello. 

i have been coding for a long while now, and starting to retire from it, so what i decided to do was give someone a chance to have their server run 24-5 from monday-friday 24 hours a day, gmt england,london time.

so theres no catch really just wanted to have a bit of fun before i retire from mopar completly. so if you want your server hosting with a no-ip/hamachi.. then add my msn then we an talk about it. thanks
