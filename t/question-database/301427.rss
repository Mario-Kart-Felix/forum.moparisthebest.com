    <title>Question Database</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-database/301427</link>
    <description>Before the summer this year I had submitted an idea which you can find [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,389322.msg2813263.html#msg2813263]here[/url] for the full details. Anyway for a short summary of the idea, I will be creating a Question Database, I have about half of it done already which was accomplished before the summer, so hopefully we can complete it this month. What will happen is that we will get a team of users from the forums, and they shall be &#39;Contributing&#39; to the database by Posting Questions and their Answers, although you cannot post a question that has been added already. There is a specific format in which the questions must be submitted in, this is to keep it neat, to see this format scroll to the bottom of this thread.

					[b][u]FAQ[/b]

[b]What will this project involve?[/b]

	This project shall involve a team of users that are accepted into the team by application to submit Questions and their Answers into
the question database, the current database we have set up is a Wiki system, which is set up on the moparscape website. The members who have been
accepted shall get a short guide on how to submit questions and how to make the submissions appear in the right category as soon as they are accepted.

This project will require a certain amount of commitment, any members who show a lack of commitment will be kicked off the team,
we are not recieving any special rank for this, so do not think you are becoming a staff member, this is more for the good of the 
community than anything else.

[b]Who are we looking for?[/b]

	We are looking for anybody who is willing to spend their own time to submit these Q &amp; A to the database, we are not looking
for anybody who signs up just for the sake of having their name on the list, they are the ones who shall be kicked off the team.
When a team member joins they are expected to post at the least 2 Questions + Answers, no less, this is a serious project.

[b]What are the requirements?[/b]

	We do not request to much off users, only to have good grammar, punctuation, spelling and have a good enough knowledge of the
various Questions we will be answering. All of those are mandatory to have, nobody shall be accepted if they are missing any of those.
If people do not impress us with their application, but they share the requirements, they shall be given a short test consisting of
15 questions, they must do well in this test to get their application accepted.

[b]Is this a server?[/b]

Last time in our old sticky we had a number of members applying for the database thinking it was a server, this is [b][u]Not[/b][/u] A server,
do not think it is.

					[b][u]Application format:[/b]
[code]
				Contact address:
				What are your experiences with private servers?:
				Write a short paragraph on any random topic (5-6 lines minimum):
				How long will you be online for?:
				How much will you contribute?:
				Do you have any previous Wiki experience?:
[/code]


	[b]Note:[/b]

	[x]If you are accepted into the project, you will receive an email as soon as possible by me regarding the Wiki
and possibly the short tutorial depending on your experience with Wiki&#39;s.

        [x]Members of the old team need not reapply, they may just post and tell me that they wish to be a part of the team again.

					[b][u]The Wiki Format[/b]


					[b]Q[/b]uestion
					[b]A[/b]nswer
					[b]E[/b]xample(s)
					[b]C[/b]onclusion

[b][u]Quick note:[/u][/b]

It seems that some people aren&#39;t getting the full concept of this, it is for private server errors, we are not recruiting people to add tutorials to the Wiki, only errors and so on.</description>

<span class="bbcode-b">Write a short paragraph on any random topic (5-6 lines minimum):</span> RuneScape Private Servers were not always the way they are today. Servers started when one man had an idea. A way to emulate a RuneScape server in order to test his bot. His name was WinterLove, aka wL. It was in a sense,a  fly-through server, meaning there really wasn’t much there, just loading the landscape, and random items on the ground. A few prominent members of the Kaitnieks community decided to take this emulation, and makeit into an actual private server. Daiki, for one, and some other members added multiplayer capapbilities, combat, npcs, trading, dueling and such to the server. This was thusly named BlakeScape. Then came MythScape, and WhiteScape, which a majority of servers are based off today. After this development, it came down to CheezeScape, and Project 16. Both of which are at the core of 98% of all servers today.<br>

			What are your experiences with private servers?: Coded a few, mainly trying to rewrite stuff now.
			Write a short paragraph on any random topic (5-6 lines minimum): Java is written by Sun. Unlike common "knowledge", Java is not a game programming language. It is a "SDL", as I call it, or Stand-Alone Development Language (Do not quote me on this, it is just what I call it.) The reason I beleive that most people here think Java is for coding games is because of what this community is. It's a game coding community.
</code></pre>
<p>Java is compiled by something called “JDK”, and run by something called “JRE”. These stand for Java Development Kit, and Java Runtime Environment. Java Runtime Environment cannot run Java files, oddly enough. This is because it is “Raw Data”. The Java Runtime Environment can only run “Class Files”. These are, for want of a better word, “Cooked Files”. Right, from now on, I’m going to explain the next bit in idioms. Right, Java Runtime Environment is your girlfriend/boyfriend. You need to feed them something nice. So, you make a nice meal. This is the “raw data” I talked about earlier. But you cant feed them a piece of raw meat, can you? So you put it in the oven. This oven is made by “Sun”. It is called “Kit”, and is part of the “Development” set. So, you put the meal in the oven, and turn it into a lovely meal of Java, which can be eaten up by the Java Runtime Environment.</p>
<p>I feel odd now :S<br>
How long will you be online for?: 4 hours a day in the week, up to 12 hours a day at weekends.<br>
How much will you contribute?: A lot. Trust me.<br>
Do you have any previous Wiki experience?: Yes, I have used them a bit before, but I’m not a pro.</p>

<p>I have not said that you were ‘declined’, I am still considering your application as you may not understand a few things, I would just suggest re-reading the main thread context while you wait.</p>
<p>Just for the people who think that there is no reason to do this, as people will not even view the Wiki. The idea has changed and varied over the last few weeks as we have discussed ways in which we can get people to use it, or rather use it to help people. There is one idea that we have that sticks out so we may be going for that one, so do not think they shall not view it, as they may not have to fully do that.</p>

<p>What are your experiences with private servers?: I’ve Coded at least most of the Runescape Private server sources and i know what half the files on a source a for and can discribe what nearly most things in that file. Example : Client.Java is the base coding file for server coding.</p>
<p>Write a short paragraph on any random topic: Runescape Private Servers are near remakes of runescape or different types of servers. A server is based on a source. The commonly known sources are : Figmentscape , All-star , Delta , Czar , Devo , Ddsspeced. There are also different version of private servers. Here are some of them : 317 , 474 , 508 , 512 , 524 , 554.</p>
<p>How long will you be online for?: I am online 3-5 hours in the week, depending on homework. 6 Hours or more on the Weekend</p>
<p>How much will you contribute?: I will contribute if i am needed to contribute and will help with some of the questions.</p>
<p>Do you have any previous Wiki experience?: I know how to use Wiki very well. I don’t use it as much as i used to but i can use it if i am needed to use it.</p>
<p>Thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Here are some of my Three questions:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What is Client.Java?</span><br>
Client.Java is usally the Base file for coding a Server.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"> What is a Server </span><br>
A server is another type of Runescape but for people who want to make their own community.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"> What is Some of the Item codes? </span><br>
995 - Money<br>
746 - Dark Dagger<br>
4587 - Noted Dragon Scimitar<br>
1333 - Noted Rune Scimitar[/quote]<br>
I almost died reading that. The class named client handles the client, a server is something a client connects to, not a runescape thingy, item ids.</p>
