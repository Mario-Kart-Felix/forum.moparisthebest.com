    <description>Hi people,

 Me and my friends have recently made an rsps but we are that stupid that we don&#39;t how to make it online, well we are having troubles with it. We have watched youtube videos on how to do it but it is being a bit hard to work with. So we have made a host off no-ip.com and now all we need its to know where to put the no-ip address that we made, we went to client.java and typed in server= and put the address there and compiled it didnt work, then we did it to all the client.java&#39;s and still didn&#39;t work so someone plz help me!!!

It would be easier if someone could do it for me, you can do that by downloading Teamviewer6-this prog allows you to view other peoples screen but only with there user and pass. Plz reply, pm me, or email me-Race.fox@hotmail.com</description>
