              <p>let me see if it has to do with the client cache because it bring options for the client which lets u choose wether u want a 317,500 or 600+ interface</p>
<p>one problem when i do this is… while i run the server it doesnt let me see the option that the client brings… because the client brings an extra interface but i cant seem to open it with this server it just showes up as blank</p>

              <p>maybe the screen is not appropriately sized for full screen or there is a problem with the bank and or magic book ids. Im not so sure about these but it could be something around these problems and it could be a very easy fix. Sorry I cannot help you further because I have never used or coded a full screen client.</p>
