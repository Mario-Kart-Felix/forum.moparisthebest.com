    <title>Able to do this with Rscd?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/able-to-do-this-with-rscd/376034</link>
    <description>Host my site for registrations on something like, hostgator lets say.
Host my Database on a separate dedicated server.(Just by itself)
Host my ls server on a separate dedicated server
Then host my run-server on a separate Dedicated server?

I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re able to, just wondering if anyone has done it &amp; if it actually works? Or tried.</description>

<p>For one, you need to get off windows regardless of how you host your server. Pick a Linux distro and install X, it’s barely any different.</p>

              <p>Retarded idea, just like the person who posted this… Wow congrats you are going to use 2-3 different servers for stupid stupid things… You need to wake up and notice how stupid this idea is congrats if a private server can cover the cost of you maintaining the servers and etc… I would like you to research about this more… If you get a good dedicated server let’s say it has 16gb of ram or something cache 4gb to the sql 6 to the webserver and 6 to the server… That will be far enough to run a private server at a good speed… The thing what pisses me off people think running private servers on a good dedicated server is all what needs to be done? You need to cache more memory to it than the default what people have setup on there home computer (512-1046)mb of ram… Yours need to think to be honest</p>
