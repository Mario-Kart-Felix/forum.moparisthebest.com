    <description>I&#39;m hosting. My port is 1357, and when I work on a server on port 43594, so many people connect. I don&#39;t want to change the port to 43594 since I&#39;ll loose the people. I copied the line of code that says what port the server runs on. However, I got an error saying that there is already that line of code. So, is there like an alternate code that will let people in on port 43594 and 1357?




Thanks.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 21, 2008, 08:12:46 pm[/size][hr]Help!</description>

<p>Simple, add another world to your server but GL doing cross-world communication such as PM system.</p>
