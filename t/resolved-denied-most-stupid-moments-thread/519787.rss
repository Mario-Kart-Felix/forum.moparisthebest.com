<p>Pretty much. We are trying to foster a positive community here, where members can thrive and post without fear. A thread like this would just be a pointless bashing.</p>
<p>Also, just in response to loveandpower talking about Rule 2. We do enforce that rule, daily. Maybe you don’t notice, however. Also you must take into account a moderators discretion, which plays a big role.</p>

<p>Are you referring to the rule “<span class="bbcode-i">Rule 2: Everybody is equal, don’t treat people worse than you do others(E.G., don’t isolate someone and flame them)</span>?”<br>
If so, that rule has been around since the creation of this site and Moparisthebest. Please correct me if I’m wrong.<br>

Was the thread not locked? I’m also pretty sure that you, as a normal user, are unable to view a profile’s infraction history, so who’s to say that users within that thread were not infracted or banned?</p>

Are you referring to the rule “<span class="bbcode-i">Rule 2: Everybody is equal, don’t treat people worse than you do others(E.G., don’t isolate someone and flame them)</span>?”<br>
If so, that rule has been around since the creation of this site and Moparisthebest. Please correct me if I’m wrong.[/quote]then why pray tell was the rule not enforced?</p>

Make a thread then, and see how the moderators react. I can guarantee it will be locked as soon as one negative reply is given.<br>
Rule two of the global rules states my point specifically:[quote]Rule 2:<br>
Everybody is equal, don’t treat people worse than you do others(E.G., don’t isolate someone and flame them).[/quote]<br>
I shouldn’t have to go any farther. Referring to my previous statement, everybody - regardless of the environment - has feelings. Respect that.<br>
[/quote]then how do you explain the actions of that ex-staff member from the mopar quotes section who was quoted eh?[/quote]<br>
Can I get a direct example, please?</p>
