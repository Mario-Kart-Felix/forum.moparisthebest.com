    <description>This source will have skillcapes, And any other item from different clients, I have just finished making commands, For the client CSK, And im starting on commands for the skillcapes of my clients, But i need ideas after i have built the commands.

Here are my ideas so far, After finishing the commands:

[b]×[/b] - Making shops for the &quot;Hard coded&quot; items in the client, Put them in one area, And leave the skillcapes for Commands.

Thats all that i have, So if you have any ideas, Please tell me.</description>
