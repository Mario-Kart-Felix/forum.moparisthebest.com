    <description>I&#39;ve been researching some jobs that Jagex offers and I&#39;ve noticed there are many separate teams they have for RS (obviously) and from what I read, you aren&#39;t required to have any type of collegical education in the career you choose. For example: Jagex&#39;s Game Engine/Core Technologies Developer requires that you are [i]very[/i] proficient at using Java, C++ or C#, which means you must have extreme knowledge of at least one of those languages. I know the most professional way to acquire a great Java knowledge and understanding is attending some type of university that offers that type of class for your desired language. My question being, is it really worth it to get a college education for the language (which is what I would like to do) or would reading it out of a book be more efficient?</description>

<p>COBOL goes back in the 1950’s.  The IBM mainframe uses JCL and COBOL/FORTRAN.  (and other veriouse old ass languages.)  I’m taking a cobol programming class in college here in Canada, and COBOL/JCL programmers are VERY VERY high in demand.  Converting from COBOL mainframes to java or a modern language would cost WAYY to much money for the big companies.  COBOL is an extremely useful language, it may be tediouse to code, but learning it is very useful as it is used a lot in the job industry.  Legacy systems are recruiting cobol programmers, and paying them very well ! XD  (Fresh legacy, Montreal)</p>

languages, especially those derived from C (which is everything you’ve mentioned) are pretty much syntactically the same. real programming skill comes from a rich background of understanding of algorithms, design, etc which is all more or less generic to any language.<br>
[/quote]<br>
In reality you don’t have to be expert in every programming lang, i started with C,and after that learning other languages are easy, in reality learning any programing language is very easy, if you are a good problem solver and good with algorithms and basic understanding of at least one language[/quote]i think the more realistic reality is that picking up other imperative languages is made much easier by already knowing one imperative language however an undergraduate’s typical struggles with Prolog and Scheme/Haskell are usually evidence against picking up new paradigms being made much easier, and a lot of companies are now opting for things like Scala and Erlang. Twitter notably ditched Ruby with RoR for Scala and many companies use Erlang internally because of it’s effectively unparalleled concurrency features.</p>

<p>In reality you don’t have to be expert in every programming lang, i started with C,and after that learning other languages are easy, in reality learning any programing language is very easy, if you are a good problem solver and good with algorithms and basic understanding of at least one language</p>

              <p>a request of proficiency with a language doesn’t mean that you need to fully understand the language’s fundamental workings; it’s more of a request for working experience and a broad scope of knowledge and application with said language ie. networking and concurrency. although fundamental knowledge and implementation understanding is useful to know, i wouldn’t say that it’s a prerequisite since most software engineering jobs stray away from working at that level, so while a content developer would probably never need to know anything too low-level, it would be expected of a core engine developer to have knowledge of lower-level topics.</p>
<p>it depends really on what you want to end up doing, but experience is one of the most important things. a self-taught hobbyist with lots of projects, lots of varied presented works and experience working on popular (open-source) projects will have a very good chance of getting a job in comparison to a by-the-book graduate with no real experience, future plans or portfolio.</p>

<p>you can learn that yourself, but it’s always better to have a teacher who can explain it clearly to you.</p>

              <p>I’ve been researching some jobs that Jagex offers and I’ve noticed there are many separate teams they have for RS (obviously) and from what I read, you aren’t required to have any type of collegical education in the career you choose. For example: Jagex’s Game Engine/Core Technologies Developer requires that you are <span class="bbcode-i">very</span> proficient at using Java, C++ or C#, which means you must have extreme knowledge of at least one of those languages. I know the most professional way to acquire a great Java knowledge and understanding is attending some type of university that offers that type of class for your desired language. My question being, is it really worth it to get a college education for the language (which is what I would like to do) or would reading it out of a book be more efficient?</p>
