    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-help-if-you-help-you-will-be-first-to-get-d/141474</link>
    <description>ok well i am going to start something not giving away till i am done but i will be replacing the prayer tab with new icons and stuff and i was wondering if anyone knew how to do that, i know sanga has a tut but thats for over your head i believe so if you know and tell me how that would be great  :D
And i mean reaplacin the pictures when you look at the prayer tab section.

So i mainly just need to know the codes for it - the arrays to change it.</description>
