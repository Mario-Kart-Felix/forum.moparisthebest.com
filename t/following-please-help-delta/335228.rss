    <description>Hello,

I have the following for, melee, range and mage in my client.java. When i log in game the range one doesnt seem to work, When hes attacking the other player with range, its like the guy is frozen but as soon as i switch the range weapon to a melee weapon he will start to run and follow the guy he is attacking. Ive tried to edit the codes but no luck.

Thank you for reading.

Help would be apreciated.</description>
