    <title>Looking to host a runescape server - abundance of Server hardware</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-host-a-runescape-server-abundance-of-server-hardware/523218</link>
    <description>I would like to set up a runescape server that mimics the way the game was from jadex as close as possible. I played around with running a runescape classic server back at my high school for a while, it was fun but I miss the runescape 2 world im used to playing in. Im good with maintaining and running servers, I also ran a world of warcraft server way back and wrote some custom lua scripts for it. Im not sure where to begin with setting up a server, so im posting here. Im looking to perhaps work with someone else to run a server that closely emulates what the official server was like.

Heres the cool part - 
Ive got a ton of rackmount servers just aching for a purpose. Servers all run linux. They are older, kinda starting to drag when it comes to running world of warcraft and Unreal related stuff, but i think they will be well suited for a runescape server. Lots of redundancy and fault tolerance.I have a fast comcast internet connection, been using it to host a web site and share files. Any suggestions on how to get started or someone with experience wanting to team up, just send a pm or an email. Again, any suggestions are welcome.
 Specs follow :

IBM netfinity 5600
4 GB of memory
raid 5 array 
dual pentium Xeon

poweredge 6450
raid 5 array with failover disk
2.50 Gb
quad pentium 3 xeon

... lots of others, too many to list, similar to above. Actually going to pick up another from a liquidateion sale warehouse tomarrow . . .</description>
