    <description>OMG HELP ME! lol

I found all these sweet 508 tuts on this other site but my server is 317 or something like that. I really want a 508 source and client so I can get more ownage xD. Only prob is that Im so picky and I always switch sources and servers and so my work is wasted. Thats why I need you. By any chance could anyone relate me to a good 508 source and hopefully a client. It needs to be stable and with a lot of features built in and hopefully HD along with a full or almost full map. Please guys I need to get started soon because school starts back in a few weeks and I won&#39;t be able to do anything. Quickly please. And I need quality also.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 23, 2009, 09:33:43 am[/size][hr]Bump?

Also Im not discontinuing support for my 317 custom server but I want a 508 too so I can appeal to the general public better.</description>
