    <description>I got EVERYTHING down of the making your own server thing except that my server WON&#39;T WORK. (that sentence just made no sense)  Anyways, my problem is, when I change the IP of my client, it says &quot;error js5.&quot;  But I followed all the steps on making a private server, and my no-ip has no problems to it.  Yet my server still isn&#39;t on.  Someone help PLEASE.  I can&#39;t get people to play my sERVER~</description>
