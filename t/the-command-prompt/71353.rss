    <title>The Command Prompt</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-command-prompt/71353</link>
    <description>ok, i suck using command prompt, the only thing i really found out to do on myself is open stuff and in typing &quot;START &lt;something here&gt;&quot; then press enter, like for a web site qand for programs and stuff like that.
i noticed one of my old friends was using command prompt to run a moparscape server, can someone explain how i can do the same? to run my own server?

please just make it simple and tell me what to type in or explain what else i have to do before it will work.
