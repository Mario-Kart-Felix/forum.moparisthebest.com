And how do I make it so I can see my the golden crown next to my name?(I already made myself admin)And is there anyway to fix the varrock tele thing so when i arrive at varrock i stay very miniscule and cant move anywhere, its sorda like the teleporter go stuck at that point. Any help would be awsome!
