    <title>I added key function to source and didnt work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-added-key-function-to-source-and-didnt-work/545967</link>
    <description>okay so i added this code to client.java


[code]    public final void keyPressed(KeyEvent keyevent) {
        int i = keyevent.getKeyCode();
	if(i == 112) {
	c.vigorlvl += 1;

	}
}[/code]

but when i hit f1 key because keycode 112 is = f1, nothing happens. i dont understand why this happens and why keyevents are only on client side. anyone know why?</description>

<p>Much like what people said above, you need to attach a KeyListener object to a component, probably a JFrame or a JPanel. You can’t accept keystrokes server sided like this, because for one the KeyListener would have to be attached to a component, which would have to be on the <span class="bbcode-b">users</span> system, to accept that users input. The best way to go about doing this is to create a custom packet, send it to the server, and have the server interpret it. You must first learn to understand how <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/clientServer.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">client-server systems</a> work. After checking out that link, you may want to cross-reference the <a href="http://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/index.php?title=317_Protocol" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">RSWiki</a> with your server, to try to understand what is going on. It won’t all come at once, you’ll get it eventually.</p>

<p>okay so you said create a custom packet and send it to the server.<br>
so the custom packet would basically just contain like "user clicked the f1 key"<br>
then send that to the server<br>
then the server will say okay if custompacket<br>
then do blah blah blah?</p>
<p>i know thats a very crappy explanation of how this would work in my mind so dont flame just wondering im code stupid haha</p>
<p>or could i make the server outstream  to the client what i want f1 key to do when i click it</p>

<p>Not sure where you are going with that last statement, so I don’t know.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/the">@The</a> rest of it: Pretty much the idea, the packet would contain the information about the player, basically which client pressed the key. Then you can take that and apply changes to that client. I’m really not the one to explain to you how building packets is done, so I’ll just leave you a link of a client to server packet on rs2, so that maybe you can take something from it, and somebody else can come along and teach you about complex packet structure and what not.</p>

All he has to do is find an opcode not already taken by an existing packet, and fill the size for that packet server sided. He actually would only have to send the packet header because there’s no data he has to include, all he’s looking for is a server sided indication of when the F1 key is pressed. Something like:</p>
<p>CLIENT</p>
<p>[code=java]…</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/override">@Override</a><br>
public final void keyPressed(KeyEvent event) {<br>
int key = event.getKeyCode();</p>
<pre><code>if(key == 112) {

    // Here we add the data to the buffer.
    JagBuffer buf = new JagBuffer();
    buf.build(opcode);

    // Then we write the data to the socket, essentially "sending" the packet to the server.
    socket.write(buf.getBuffer());
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>…[/code]</p>
<p>SERVER</p>
<p>[code=java]<span class="mention">@PacketIdentifiers</span>({ opcode })<br>
public class DecodeF1KeyPacket implements PacketDecoder {</p>
<pre><code>@Override
public void decode(Player player, ProtocolBuffer buf, int length, int size) {

    // The server will decode the packet sent from the client and send this message to the player.
    player.getPacketBuilder().sendMessage("You have just pressed the F1 key!");
}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>depending on the server and client your code will be a lot different than mine, its not hard at all though and you should have a basic insight on how I/O works now[/quote]<br>
He could have to send a bit more than just the header, because it’d be a bit logical to make the packet handle <span class="bbcode-b">all</span> the F keys, instead of a packet for each.</p>

The best way to go about doing this is to create a custom packet, send it to the server, and have the server interpret it. You must first learn to understand how <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/clientServer.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">client-server systems</a> work. After checking out that link, you may want to cross-reference the <a href="http://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/index.php?title=317_Protocol" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">RSWiki</a> with your server, to try to understand what is going on. It won’t all come at once, you’ll get it eventually.</p>

              <p>As I said in the last topic. KeyEvents are going to be done client sided, you have to send the data from the client to your server using packets.<br>
Look in your client how the packet is sent, since they differ at times.</p>

              <p>okay so i added this code to client.java</p>
<p>[code]    public final void keyPressed(KeyEvent keyevent) {<br>
int i = keyevent.getKeyCode();<br>
if(i == 112) {<br>
c.vigorlvl += 1;</p>
<pre><code>}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>but when i hit f1 key because keycode 112 is = f1, nothing happens. i dont understand why this happens and why keyevents are only on client side. anyone know why?</p>
