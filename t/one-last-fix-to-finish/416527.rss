    <title>One last fix to finish</title>

    <description>Hi once again I got one more fix I need help with. My edgeville shopkeeper won&#39;t allow sell of items. But all the other shops do. Someone said something about itemvar might be wrong but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the problem since it worked when I first put this online.</description>

<p>Your first suggestion make’s since, but your second one does not. It used to work selling items, now for no reason it won’t.  I’ve added “custom” gear they sell/buy just fine. But still won’t show your inventory when edge falador and every other shop sells all inventory just fine. Also each time I try to add bows and runes it says the bind is already in use… When clearly it’s not being sold somewhere.</p>

<p>I am failing to understand what you mean, if you can explain again I might be able to help you.</p>
