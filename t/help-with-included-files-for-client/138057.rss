    <title>Help with included files for client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-included-files-for-client/138057</link>
    <description>Well I have been working on making a client for PicoScape, and I thank you all for leading me through some of it. 

I just found a possible problem for me, on why I get a java heap space error. I haven&#39;t been packing .idx files with my jar maker. Since its not a default file. I have a list of file types I need to add. But one thing I need to add is a file that is named jkld or something like that. Really random, there are a few files like this in the same directory as the .wav files. But it has no assigned file type. It literally just called a &quot;file&quot; on my computer. How do I go about adding these files to the jar?</description>

              <p>Thats good advice, unfortunately my cache should include dark bow according to my friend. He got it for me. And if I did that then I wouldn’t have it would I? Also, if I do have to result to that, where it client.java would I find that path?[br][size=1]Posted on: August 28, 2007, 06:01:36 PM[/size][hr]How would I make my client read from the mopar cache?</p>
