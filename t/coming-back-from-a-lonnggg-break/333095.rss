If you were, even from the longest brake possible you would know how to answer these questions very easily.</p>
<p>1st off, to change the source to connect to your server? You don’t have to… its a source, unless it has anti leech it should connect to your Ip.</p>
<p>2nd You should be able to find a client in server, downloads etc…</p>
<p>3rd To make the client to connect to your ip go to either client.java or egu.java something along the lines of that.</p>
<p>4th, read next time before you post, it says no request aloud, so don’t request…<br>
Next time don’t act like you were a pro coder and just be straight forward…[/quote]</p>
<p>I figured someone would say that… and in all honesty i did code… i never said i was a pro coder… i just don’t remember where the stuff was…</p>
