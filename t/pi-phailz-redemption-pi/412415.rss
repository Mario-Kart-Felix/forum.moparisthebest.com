    <description>[size=18pt]Phailz Redemption![/size]


[size=14pt]Hello Fellow moparscape players, i decided to finish what i started a while ago. Some Features/Updates are Below!!

Features:

-Added a Fun Pk Arena.
-Fixed the log in announcements, and the alert system. (Tutorial)
-Fixed prayer draining, and prayer bonuses. Version 1&#39;s leeches where better than turmoil, and everything drained VERY quickly. All that has been fixed now.
-Various special attack edits, including correct korasi&#39;s effect (other than mage hitting), almost every dragon item&#39;s special, every godsword, and any bow specials.
-Changed the gameframe. (Super quick fix)
-Fixed the Auto-Cache Downloader.
-Changed prices and made them more suitable to the server.
-Fixed herblore up a bit. Some potions didn&#39;t give the right bonuses and/or didn&#39;t drain right.
-Improved combat. Not nearly as many 0&#39;s.
-Fixed dead locking.
-Fixed many items that equipped in the wrong slots.
-Changed a couple of commands. (Made them more efficient)
-Added the private chat messages not always sending glitch.
-Added &quot;Destroying&quot; objects. (Look in config class)
-Fixed the Dragon Dagger glitch that helped you hit really high with it&#39;s special.
-Reworked thieving a slight bit.
-Fixed a good amount of dupes. (Thanks to tutorials)[/size]
[size=24pt]More updates Coming Soon![/size]</description>

You might want to fix up your thread. It looks really plain and boring to look at, try centering, using a few colors, don’t make everything so big, maybe get a nice banner…</p>
<p>And you might want to add pictures.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
