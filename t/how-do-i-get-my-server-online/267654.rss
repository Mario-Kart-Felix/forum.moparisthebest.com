    <title>How do i get my server online?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-get-my-server-online/267654</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t seem to get my server to go online so other players can enjoy it. I have made a no-ip and ran the no-ip DUC but it still will not go on. I have tried using my own ip instead of the one from no-ip but it still won&#39;t go up. I have also looked in the tutorial section but there dosen&#39;t seem to be one on how to get your server online for other players. If anyone could try to help me it would be greatly apreciated.
