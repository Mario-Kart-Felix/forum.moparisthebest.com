    <description>[center]If you do now wish staff members you may eliminate this post.[/center]

Dear MoparScape.org

	I am at present on a staff computer. I wish to report to you that my system has crashed due to errors of compatibility. I may not be able to respond to any replies or make any posts for a while, and because of this I will appoint staff members to speak in my place and I give you my solid word of honor that their coding skills are very high. Now I hope that I do not find any belligerence between members of the forums and members of my staff while I am absent.
	If there is by chance any trouble with a staff member you can report them by going through LegendScape.net and the matter will be settled immediately. If further problems arise you may contact me via E-mail Administrator@legendScape.net. 

Sincerely LegendScape Administrator.</description>
