    <title>One good thing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/one-good-thing/426384</link>
    <description>[center]I just want to make a little topic because of the holiday season.
 No matter what religion you are (even if you aren&#39;t, like me), this season
 is a time of giving and helping one another. Try and think of how you&#39;re life
 has been for the past year, maybe it&#39;s not perfect, maybe you don&#39;t have
 the newest phone or a nicer car but just think that there is someone out there
 that has it worse off then you. I want to ask everyone who sees this to try
 and do [i]ONE[/i] good thing for the people around you who are worse off. Maybe it&#39;s
 a teacher who has two kids and is struggling, a man who wont be able to give 
his kids a nice Christmas because hes broke, or a local homeless man who could 
really use a warm coat or a nice meal. I&#39;m not saying go out and do this for everyone
 you know, but if you can just put [i]ONE[/i] change for the better into someones life, 
it would make all the difference for them. 

Happy Holidays everyone,
Andrew[/center]</description>

If you are being a fag, aren't you having a nice day? I mean, nice hair, clean face, and properly dressed. Besides being fucked in the ass occationly it seems pretty awesome, maybe even worth it. 0.0 Got fact smacked.

</aside>
<p>This irritates me. The X comes from the greek letter Chi, which is the first letter of the Greek word Χριστός, translated as “Christ”.<br>
“Happy Holidays” is to respect people who don’t celebrate Christmas, and if someone tells me Happy Holidays, I’m grateful they at least took the time to say something kind. I don’t mind if a Christian tells me Merry Christmas, an Atheist says Happy Holidays, a Jew says Happy Hanukkah, or Hell, even Happy Winter Solstice.</p>
