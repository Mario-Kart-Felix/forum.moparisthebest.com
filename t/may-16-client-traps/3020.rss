    <description>Traps - May 16 client

[b] #1 - Thou shalt not perform operations with our string wrappers![/b]
In the String wrapper class, there overridden high-hierarchy methods like
[code]
    public final boolean equals(Object obj)
    {
        try
        {
            anInt1382++; //see #3
            throw new RuntimeException();
        }
        catch(RuntimeException runtimeexception)
        {
            throw Class27_Sub11_Sub3_Sub6.method409(runtimeexception, &quot;lc.equals(&quot; + (obj == null ? &quot;null&quot; : &quot;{...}&quot;) + &#39;)&#39;);
        }
    }

    public final String toString()
    {
        try
        {
            anInt1400++; //see #3
            throw new RuntimeException();
        }
        catch(RuntimeException runtimeexception)
        {
            throw Class27_Sub11_Sub3_Sub6.method409(runtimeexception, &quot;lc.toString(&quot; + &#39;)&#39;);
        }
    }
[/code]
Invoking these methods will trigger an exception, which is caught and turned into a RuntimeException wrapper class. I haven&#39;t fully explored
the wrapper class yet, but it could easily notify Jagex of its creation (which, in this case, is from a method that obviously shouldn&#39;t be called in the first place).


[b]#2 - Renaming[/b]
If you would please direct your attention to the following code:
    public final AppletContext getAppletContext()
    {
        try
        {
            anInt27++;
            if(Class27_Sub8.aCanvas_Sub1_1635 != null)
                return null;
            if(Class27_Sub11_Sub6.aClass48_2045 != null &amp;&amp; Class27_Sub11_Sub6.aClass48_2045.anApplet965 != this)
                return Class27_Sub11_Sub6.aClass48_2045.anApplet965.getAppletContext();
            else
                return super.getAppletContext();
        }
        catch(RuntimeException runtimeexception)
        {
            throw Class27_Sub11_Sub3_Sub6.getRuntimeExceptionWrapper(runtimeexception, [b]&quot;me.getAppletContext(&quot; + &#39;)&#39;)[/b];
        }
    }

Now, what can a stack trace from a Throwable plus a method name tell us?
[code]
java.lang.RuntimeException
        at Test.main(Test.java:5)
[/code]

[b]DO NOT RUN THIS CLIENT RENAMED!!!![/b]

Following the refs...
[code]
static final void method258(String s, Throwable throwable, int i)
[/code]

leads to 

[code]
   static final void reporterror(int i, String s)
    {
        try
        {
            if(i != 35)
                method172(108);
            anInt1480++;
            System.out.println(&quot;Error: &quot; + s);
            try
            {
                s = s.replace(&#39;:&#39;, &#39;.&#39;);
                s = s.replace(&#39;@&#39;, &#39;_&#39;);
                s = s.replace(&#39;&amp;&#39;, &#39;_&#39;);
                s = s.replace(&#39;#&#39;, &#39;_&#39;);
                Class58 class58;
                for(class58 = Class63.aClass48_1250.method807(0, new URL(Class63.aClass48_1250.anApplet965.getCodeBase(), &quot;reporterror.ws?c=&quot; + Class39.anInt806 + &quot;&amp;u=&quot; + Class27_Sub11_Sub3_Sub6_Sub2.aLong2810 + &quot;&amp;v1=&quot; + Class48.aString967 + &quot;&amp;v2=&quot; + Class48.aString956 + &quot;&amp;e=&quot; + s)); class58.anInt1144 == 0;)
                    Class27_Sub11_Sub13.method576((byte)15, 1L);

                if(~class58.anInt1144 == -2)
                {
                    DataInputStream datainputstream = (DataInputStream)class58.anObject1145;
                    datainputstream.read();
                    datainputstream.close();
                    return;
                }
            }
            catch(Exception _ex)
            {
                return;
            }
        }
        catch(RuntimeException runtimeexception)
        {
            throw runtimeexception;
        }
    }[/code]

[b]#3 - Method call counters[/b]
In all classes, there are counter variables at the beginning of each method. 
Found no use of them yet, but they record how many times each method is called (all initialized in method50). 
Useful for something like calculateScreenPosition, which can be used by the legit client and cheaters - too many calls and your user is cheating.</description>

<p>Interesting, I sort of abandoned looking at the method after I realized it was being passed a complete Throwable. Should go look more carefully.</p>

<blockquote><p>As for renaming, the only part that is risky, is renaming Classes. Renaming fields and methods wont do anything, because it automatically puts the method name in the error report, but the class name isnt like that. For example, i just copied/pasted the error methods, made my own little error, and this was the output<br>"test:11 | java.lang.Exception | de.D(50)", test = the class  name, thats the ONLY feature that it reads, so as long as you rename the class names back, i fail to see no trouble in it, and also if you inject code, you're fucked, it reads the line # which the error was on, aka the exception, but whatever, still nice finds, hope to progress</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>You're discounting the information stored in the rest of the RuntimeException object <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=3" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>Take a look at <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/StackTraceElement.html" rel="nofollow">java.lang.StackTraceElement</a>, which you can retrieve by calling Throwable.getStackTrace() (java.lang.Throwable is the superclass of all Error and Exception objects).</p>

<p>Or, were you not inclined to act like an egotistical 8 year old, it could be helping another person along. You don't even provide clues, just unfounded assertion. There's this strange idea out there in the world that "helping people" is a <span class="bbcode-i">good thing</span>. It's not doing someone's work for them, but rather encouraging them to continue their work by providing what you might happen to know. "Collaboration." Try lookin it up.</p>

<p>This will indubitably receive the "but I don't need help, I'm oh-so-far-advanced that I just laugh from my mighty perch, and you may rest assured that this perch is deserved without any justfications" answer which is your accustomed style, but, for God's sake, you could at the very least make an effort at <span class="bbcode-b">not being an outright prick to people who are trying to do something productive</span>.</p>

<p>While I assume that most of us have come to accept the fact that, for whatever reason, your ego fragilely rests upon your professed abilities at cheating in a game for 12 year olds, that doesn't mean you are required to adopt the behaviour of their target audience.</p>

<p>Grow up, learn to show respect to others like a fucking rational human being.</p>

There's another reason why you can't use a renamed client. He didn't mention it, but mopar, when he does, you'll look like a complete fool. There's a LOT more reason than just what he said as far as renaming goes.</p>

<p>Reading the zkm log.... You know, I'll actually help with that :-p. Krich is on the right track, using hte zkm log == good.</p>

<p>Presumably there are conditions under which they <em>expect</em> to receive an error, such as when there actually is one.

<p>they couldnt ban people for the client disconnecting but not sending information about it, because that could happen if the internet connection cut out, however they could do crappy things like intentionally causing an error just to check if its renamed (I somehow doubt they would be smart/desperate enough to do this, but who knows? the potential is always there)</p>

<p>zelix dumps a changelog of what it renames (which would be the original, expected names) it wouldnt be too hard to write a program to parse the zelix changelog and convert it to a better format, perhaps xml? then while renaming to what we want just change the value in the xml sheet to the new value, all this would be done while updating</p>

<p>the bot would only need a new class which we would write that we could send in a runtimeexception, and it would return a new, renamed runtimeexception, this I believe would be the correct way to handle it, and although it would be annoying to write it wouldnt be too hard, if anyone else thinks this would be the proper way to go about this just say and Ill write up the whole thing ;D</p>

<p>What I intend to do anyway, but missing something since I am not seeing what is gained by making wrappers for it all.</p>

<p>Krichevskoy the method names in the throws follow the convention of A, B, C, D, etc.... so they can determine the true method, rather than having 3 methods obbed to a, and all three of them coming out like a.A in thier exception. AFAICT</p>
