              <p>Imo, I think they look for totally different accounts that do the same thing as other accounts, which could possibly mean they’re using the same scripts… I use RSBot now, I used to use Scar. I’ve never received a ban for macroing. When I begin using a new script, I change wait times, coords, break times, all stuff that can change depending on the user, so it makes my account look unique.</p>
<p>I also don’t bot 10 hours a day like some of the tards here do, I do a max of 3-4 a day.</p>

<p>Of course they’re bluffing, Jagex don’t do anything about anyone unless you actually get reported, and when you get reported, it can be for any reason, Jagex checks all their logs and all the things that you’ve been up to on rs. I had botted pure ess for ~1 week straight and then about 2 weeks after someone reported me for Offensive language and I get banned for macroning. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Wrong. Jagex doesn’t just look for people who have been reported, but abnormal things such as getting stuck in a random for 1+ hours.</p>
