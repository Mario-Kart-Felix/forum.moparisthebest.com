    <title>The ONLY duping that taken place</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-only-duping-that-taken-place/2398</link>
    <description>Ok allot of you saying duping was back, but no neverm my friend jut and sixfeetunder wer the ones who found it out, heres the FULL story with EVERYTHING they duped.


Heres what xx jut xx says...

 2003 November 7 was a historical moment for RuneScape. Jagex catched a lot of players, who were cheating - cheaters created a lot of new items, including party hats and crackers.

The Down-Low About Duping by Iost Iunatic (SixFeetUnder)

[img]http://games.infoseka.lt/duping1.jpg[/img]

Here it goes...
I was the person who discovered the dupe and used it, and told like 3 other people, and then it got leaked. If it hadn&#39;t gotten leaked, I would be rich and the economy wouldn&#39;t suck, and Jagex wouldn&#39;t be uber pissed at me. This shall be a historical acount of the third time of duping. Before you begin to read this, please know this had no intentions of hurting the economy, or Jagex in any way shape or form. As for me, I have been banned on every character I own (including ones that did not use the dupe and we&#39;re banned out of error. Jagex wouldn&#39;t listen to my appeal though). Because of this, I am also quitting RuneScape now. But hey, at least im going out with a major bang. Now, onto the fun/interesting stuff.

[img]http://games.infoseka.lt/duping2.jpg[/img]

 The way the dupe worked was when in a trade screen it would put up a non-stackable item with an amount of zero, where it would normally be one. This would trick my side into thinking I put up nothing, and the other into thinking I put up one. So really, it&#39;s not duping because you don&#39;t need one to start with. It&#39;s more like &quot;Creation.&quot; It also used an item ID. An item id is the number given to an item. No, each item does not have it&#39;s own ID. All r2h&#39;s are item 81, and all pink hats are item 580. This is why it is extremely hard for Jagex to find out which hats are real and which are fake. Here are some other numbers of items:

580 - Pink Hat
579 - Green Hat
581 - White Hat
576 - Red Hat
578 - Blue Hat
577 - Yellow
1278 - Dragon Square
795 - Dragon Med
575 - Cracker
81 - Rune Two Hander

And the next morning. Note that this was my main, who I had NOT logged into at any time during the whole duping dealy so he wouldn&#39;t get banned for bug abuse. Well guess what, he was banned.

This is the total TRUTH if you chose not to belive dont post, cuss i dont give a flying fuck :)</description>

<p>“The little black book of RuneScape cheating” has these pictures, I think. It also has info of other events, such as the banker killing. Maybe someone should post a link to it.</p>

              <p>This was more of an “item spawn” and not a dupe, since the spawners had no real party hats to start with. They just spawned those out of nothing.</p>
<p>If the server rolls back your save and not someone you have traded with, you can dupe items. This is very rare.</p>

              <p>Ok allot of you saying duping was back, but no neverm my friend jut and sixfeetunder wer the ones who found it out, heres the FULL story with EVERYTHING they duped.</p>
<p>Heres what xx jut xx says…</p>
<p>2003 November 7 was a historical moment for RuneScape. Jagex catched a lot of players, who were cheating - cheaters created a lot of new items, including party hats and crackers.</p>
<p>The Down-Low About Duping by Iost Iunatic (SixFeetUnder)</p>
<p><img src="http://games.infoseka.lt/duping1.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Here it goes…<br>
I was the person who discovered the dupe and used it, and told like 3 other people, and then it got leaked. If it hadn’t gotten leaked, I would be rich and the economy wouldn’t suck, and Jagex wouldn’t be uber pissed at me. This shall be a historical acount of the third time of duping. Before you begin to read this, please know this had no intentions of hurting the economy, or Jagex in any way shape or form. As for me, I have been banned on every character I own (including ones that did not use the dupe and we’re banned out of error. Jagex wouldn’t listen to my appeal though). Because of this, I am also quitting RuneScape now. But hey, at least im going out with a major bang. Now, onto the fun/interesting stuff.</p>
<p><img src="http://games.infoseka.lt/duping2.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>The way the dupe worked was when in a trade screen it would put up a non-stackable item with an amount of zero, where it would normally be one. This would trick my side into thinking I put up nothing, and the other into thinking I put up one. So really, it’s not duping because you don’t need one to start with. It’s more like “Creation.” It also used an item ID. An item id is the number given to an item. No, each item does not have it’s own ID. All r2h’s are item 81, and all pink hats are item 580. This is why it is extremely hard for Jagex to find out which hats are real and which are fake. Here are some other numbers of items:</p>
<p>580 - Pink Hat<br>
579 - Green Hat<br>
581 - White Hat<br>
576 - Red Hat<br>
578 - Blue Hat<br>
577 - Yellow<br>
1278 - Dragon Square<br>
795 - Dragon Med<br>
575 - Cracker<br>
81 - Rune Two Hander</p>
<p><img src="http://games.infoseka.lt/duping3.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>And the next morning. Note that this was my main, who I had NOT logged into at any time during the whole duping dealy so he wouldn’t get banned for bug abuse. Well guess what, he was banned.</p>
<p>This is the total TRUTH if you chose not to belive dont post, cuss i dont give a flying fuck <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
