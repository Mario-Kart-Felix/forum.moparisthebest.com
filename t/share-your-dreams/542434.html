        <p>well, i’m not sure what to feel about this dream that i dreamt of a few years ago but it’s so fudged up i can’t forget it:</p>
<p>It started with me being in a pool at night drowning by something heavy tied to my leg, I couldn’t see what, then suddenly my brother came dressed in a superman suit and was flying then he lifted me by his hand and pulled me out and untied me, then he flew away.<br>
After that i heard a scream from our neighbors house, and i went to check it out, There was a lady standing there saying that her husband was pulled by a werewolf through a hole in the house ( I don’t even know… ), Then i wanted to see what was that so i put my head into that hole in the house and then suddenly as soon as i got my head through the hole that werewolf thing attacked my head really fast which made me jump a little when i was asleep and woke up terrified.</p>

<p>Really?[/quote]Seems to be a common thing actually - <a href="http://lucid.wikia.com/wiki/Reality_check" rel="nofollow noopener">http://lucid.wikia.com/wiki/Reality_check</a></p>
<blockquote>In a dream it is often difficult to read characters and numbers because the area of the brain responsible for those tasks is shut down. They tend to change or morph in peculiar ways, especially if the dreamer's attention moves away from them and back again. Thus, it is difficult to tell the exact time in dreams, especially if one is looking at a digital clock.
<p>On an analogue timepiece, the numerals and their positions are implicit, so by habit they are not usually read in real life. Actually, many analogue watches don’t even have them. If the hands are sensibly placed, you may not give the time much critical judgment. The hands on an analogue watch may change in a bizarre manner similar to numerals and characters, but not as much.</p>

        <p>The last dream i remember before waking up was very strange…</p>
<p>I found myself in a dark place (my old school court) surrounded by a horde of the vampires (creepy goblin like dwellers), standing slightly above them as though on a stage. With someone i knew to be my brother (i don’t have a brother irl), and they weren’t killing us. Instead, as it happens my “father” in this dream was a vampire so we were one of them but still looked human. They let us go after a conversation i can’t remember and i ran off home, because i was worried they’d kill me.</p>
<p>Following this, I was in an area where on one side was a strange large castle like building (vampire place) with houses behind me and other building around me. I was with a group of people who were apparently professionals in avoiding vampire attacks, and i was new to this game. I was walking along side someone who was basically teaching me the rules or ways of survival, saying how i had to hide before it was dark because that is when they come out. As this happened, it was also getting darker within the dream and less colourful. In the distance i could see these creatures coming toward me, panicking i set off to find a hiding spot - somewhere they couldn’t find me. This turned out to naturally be my wardrobe, which didn’t work because when i woke i was in another area. I knew that they had somehow found me, yet not killed me as i thought.</p>
<p>At that point i kinda knew why i hadn’t been eaten, but i never said it to the rest who had hidden properly from them because i didn’t want them to think i was a vampire. So the next night after getting advice and such on why i was just “moved”, i was standing in the yard when they’d come running out because it was dark. People who were out ran off to hide but they were already walking around and past me, talking to me. The others thought this was weird, i could see them in the distance or at least my mind told me so. I went and hid in my bed afterwards because i thought i was safe there, and when the night was over the other guys came out and asked why i wasn’t attacked.</p>
<p>They found out i was of vampire relations and were all shocked about it and a little scared but at that point i woke up. Can only remember bits an pieces, but generally my dreams are kinda like movies… I’m not necessarily me in my dream i could be anyone, even 3rd person.</p>

        <p>Us old people don’t really get many “dreams” any more and when we do they are considered more or less as assumed “vivid but vague visions of the future” or something like that</p>
<p>Anyway… a few years back I had a dream that I was standing behind like a desk or podium or something and I was unable to really make out if they were students or like adults or what. So I assume I have either a leadership role, counselor role, or an instructor role in the future some time. So who knows ?</p>
<p>I try not to ponder on dreams too much as if it’s a real dream it will come to past one way or another and a lot of times it may even come true and you don’t even realize it until a little later after it has come true and you are like “omg I dreamed that!” Yeah…true story…0_o…</p>
