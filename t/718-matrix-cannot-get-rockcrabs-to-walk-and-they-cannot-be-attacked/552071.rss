    <title>[718 Matrix] Cannot get RockCrabs to walk and they cannot be attacked</title>

    <description>Greetings gentlemen and gentleladies,

I have become extremely frustrated with matrix at this point. A few hours of searching have pretty well resulted in the same issue over and over.


First I simply added the spawns in packedspawns.txt, deleted the .p and restarted. All dandy, they spawned. They didn&#39;t move however, and I wasn&#39;t able to attack them.

Then I began to tweak the combat definitions, still with no luck. Moved onto the NPC.java to enable walking.

Added:

[code]if(id == 1265)
		setRandomWalk(false); //also tried true
		if(id == 1267)
		setRandomWalk(false); //also tried true
[/code]
Above:
[code]if (isForceWalking()) {[/code]

Still won&#39;t move. Tried various other solutions. Then I tried this tutorial: https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=553733.0

Still nothing.

Am I missing something, as that tutorial added the spawns via an old method, why am I unable to make them move?

Is there some method somewhere stopping their movement that I need to override? 

I also tried adding a case here in NPC.java:

[code]private static boolean forceRandomWalk(int npcId) {
		switch (npcId) {
		case 11226:
			return true;
		case 3341:
		case 3342:
		case 3343:
			return true;
		default:
			return false;
			/*
			 * default: return NPCDefinitions.getNPCDefinitions(npcId).name
			 * .equals(&quot;Icy Bones&quot;);
			 */
		}
	}[/code]

Again no luck for movement. 

Thanks for the help fellas!

[s]EDIT: NPC 1267 is attackable, but not 1265.[/s] Nevermind, only attackable when spawned by command.</description>
