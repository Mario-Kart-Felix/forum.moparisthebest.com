    <title>Hacking Steam or Gmail [RESOLVED]</title>

    <description>Hear me out before you assume

Just today my Steam account was hacked and I want it back before this guy gets it banned, yes I have submitted a ticket to Steam and Gmail and no response. I mean don&#39;t tell me here, add my skype &quot;skpe_x_summer&quot;. This guy changed the password retrieval email to his so I cannot do that but if I were able to get into his Email I would be able to set it back to mine. Those who know me will know that the Steam name is all the more proof that the account is actually mine and no I am not trying to exploit you guys, I&#39;m just desperate.

P.S. I have all his information, Email, Name, Ip Address etc.
