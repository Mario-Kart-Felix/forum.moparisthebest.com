    <title>Ironman RSC server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ironman-rsc-server/549214</link>
    <description>Would anyone be interested in a Ironman RSC server with [i]retail like experience rates[/i]? (1-3x)

The rules would be inspired by the ones on OSRS.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ironman mode is a type of gameplay where self-sufficiency is key. You cannot receive any help from other players, you cannot trade, and so on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;[ul][li]You will be unable to trade player-to-player [s]and you cannot use the Grand Exchange, except for the purchase of bonds[/s].
[/li]

[li]You will be unable to pick up items from the floor, this includes those dropped by other players and those dropped by monsters killed by other players.[/li][/ul]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#39;ve gotten this idea from a post in Kizl&#39;s thread regarding his ideal RSC. This would severly limit PKing and Staking, since the drops/rewards would have to be removed. But I&#39;m sure that there could be a way to incorporate some exception or other system to reward those who want to PK. 

Anyways, sections seem dead and I thought that I would start some discussion. What would work and what couldn&#39;t?

Best regards,
a dinosaur.

              <p>Would be like playing on a low pop server with bad eco. Which are ok at first but then get boring after your flats and have gotten the best drops. Would have to have better exp rates and  a way for pking to work or i’d never play.</p>
