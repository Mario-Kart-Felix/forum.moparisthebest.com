    <title>Please Help, How Does This Code Even Work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-help-how-does-this-code-even-work/285839</link>
    <description>I am not new to java, so this may sound like a contradicting statement but my question will remain the same no matter.

I am curious on how a client works...
 Now before you begin to think of a smart ass rant, i am curious on how the server and the client corespond, as in how does the server go into the files of the client, and dictate what to use, i am thinking that when the server goes online, and you connect the directory becomes the HOST of the files and the server is just there to pick and choose, i am trying to set up my own game like Moparscape, but with me as the only server, and i am curious if i could do that with moparscape, like you guys do with your homemade clients, like how it is possible to add objects as long as everyone has the same client, i am curious if i could possibly add enough objects and terrain, enough to fill the client and make it look as if it was not even close to runescape.

I looked for a place to post this BTW and there is no fucking place so before you rant with your 12yo BS, please note i did put some attention to where i should post.


-Thanks.

              <p>If you want to edit the maps you can use this map editor:<br>

<p>Plus you can create your own npcs, armour/weapons and objects using a modeling program:<br>

<p>And Finally, if you want to edit textures and interfaces use AuraDevil Cache Modifier/Repacker<br>
