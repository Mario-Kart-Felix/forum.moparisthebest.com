They call it the actual Tiger effect.&quot;It&#39;s massive, people who have never literally game want to start to play the game, study the game, emulate Padraig harrington,&quot; says Mickey Klein, a golf equipment salesman. If Tiger uses it, other golfers need it. &quot;Just by virtue of the fact that heutes endorsed a particular golf ball people are coming in on a regular basis asking for that golf ball which is the new Nike basketball,&quot; says Klein. Nike wasnt even known for sets until the company closed Tiger to his multimillion-dollar endorsement deal. But Tigers influence should go far beyond golfings brand names.  &quot;Hes like Michael Nike jordan in golf, affirms an admirer.Tiger assists change the very identity of the game. It&#39;s no longer just for the country club set. &quot;Down right here weve got bus drivers, waiters, pub tenders, guys who push trucks and have a few hours to lay over--you name the idea,&quot; says Dennis Duden of the Mission Bay Golfing Center. But it is not only golf in which Tiger&#39;s selling now. He has become a powerful pitchman pertaining to watches credit cards and cars.
