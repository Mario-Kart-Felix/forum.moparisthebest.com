    <title>Can someone help? have a few issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-help-have-a-few-issues/259801</link>
    <description>1. Is it because im using Mopar client that everything seems old? If so what is a good client to use with Allstarscape source?
2. While on allstar scape and I try and trade a shop keeper it just freezes, no idea on this one.
3. How do I know if I can use a client or not? hearn about it being open or closed?
 :confused: :confused: :confused:
I believe that is all for now, thanks guys.</description>

<li>As xjadefighter said, silabsoft is a good opinion</li>
<li>One of the shops in allstar is glitched if im right so it could be that.</li>
<li>You Should take a client with as few as possible null’s, silabclient has no nulls. Unless you want to have customs.</li>

<li>Is it because im using Mopar client that everything seems old? If so what is a good client to use with Allstarscape source?</li>
