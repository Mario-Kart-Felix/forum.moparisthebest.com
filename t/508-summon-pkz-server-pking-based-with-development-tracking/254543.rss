[i]Hey everyone of the Moparscape community, I am currently working on my 508. I&#39;ve been working on and off it recently, because I havn&#39;t really had much time due to school etc.
I did a lot of work during the Holidays before Christmas (Since christmas I have been no-lifing on my New Xbox 360 :D). This server will be made around Pking, and will be based in Edgeville. You will have to work for Pking supplies/Good levels for pking. There will be shops spread around Edgeville, which will consist of Herblore (For potions), Fishing/Cooking (For good food, though monkfish will be sold in a shop), RuneCrafting (For magic training/Pking runes), crafting (For amulets/rings/Dragonhide, but you will have to kill monsters for the hide to craft the Armour from, Fletching for Rune arrows/Knives (All up to adamant will be sold in shops) and slayer (For weapons such as abyssal whips, Dark Bows etc).

One of the [b]Main[/b] features of this server, will be [b]FULL[/b] sounds. So far the combat is filled witht he correct sounds for the correct weapon/Spell. I have already added sounds to some skills, such as thieving, fletching, fishing and cooking. A lot of the NPC&#39;s emotes have the sounds built into them already, but I have also added quite a few NPC sounds.

My plan is to get all the features of this server, [b]FULL[/b] with the correct sounds.[/i]


[u][b]General features[/b][/u]


[ul][li]Almost perfect Combat system.[/li]
[li]Full modern Magics, almost done with Ancients.[/li]
[li]Filled with the correct sounds for the correct action, Planning to get it Full.[/li]
[li]NPC&#39;s face you when they follow you, whether it be when they are attacking you, or they are a familiar/pet.[/li]
[li]Full wilderness levels, with Perfect 1 Vs 1 areas.[/li]
[li]All special attacks.[/li]
[li]All barrows sets have the correct special features added to them. Eg. Guthans heals you, and dharoks makes you hit higher the lower your HitPoints are.[/li]
[li]The server will have a stable economy.[/li]
[li]Full Melee Defence &amp; attack bonuses.[/li]
[li]Full Ranged Defence &amp; attack bonuses.[/li]
[li]Full Magic Defence &amp; attack bonuses.[/li]
[li]Prayers reduce/boost the accuracy of your/your opponents attack. Eg. Steel skin will reduce the accuracy of the opponent hitting through your defence.[/li]
[li]A start to summoning, no dismissing as of yet, but there is Calling the familiar, speaking to it, and It&#39;s face is shown on the Summoning tab.[/li]
[li]Planning to add music to each area, I have already added music to the wilderness, Bountyhunter, Duel arena, and varrock/Falador.[/li][/ul]

.•*´¨) [b]Development[/b] (¨´*•.[/u]

5th January 2009:
[code] - All spells that freeze, now freeze instantly when casted.
 - Added more 1v1 Areas.
 - Added &#39;Casting when the combat delay is 0&#39; - Which means when you cast the spell, when the combat delay is Greater than 0, it will cast the spell when the delay is 0, adding a video/GIF image soon.[/code]


3rd January 2009:
[code] - Already had following while attacking, but now it actually attacks while following.
 - Created destroy Item. This took me a long time to get the arrays for the item on interface correct.[/code]


2nd January 2009:
[code] - Added Full item on item herblore, also with herb cleaning, Added a short video.
 - Fixed up fishing, and made the timer that you get a fish, random (Depending on what your fishing level is, and the level required). Short video added.[/code]


[b]I will update this every day to show what i have done each day, Unless I am out all day, or don&#39;t have time.[/b]</description>

[li]Armadyl GodSword accuracy was off, hit 0 more than most weapons - This is now fixed.[/li]<br>

<p>Thanks. I’ve made the ancient spells hit a it earlier than they did before; they weren’t the same as RS.</p>
<p>I’m also going to make it so the GFX hit’s before it actually inflicts damage on you with the Ancient ice spells (Rush, burst, blitz, barrage), because thats how it is in RS.</p>
<p>I’m trying to get the combat as perfect to RS as possible ;).<br>

this is most likely the best worked on 508 yet! apart from being a pking server this is most likely closest we could get to runescape[/quote]</p>

<p>Thanks. I’ve made the ancient spells hit a it earlier than they did before; they weren’t the same as RS.</p>
<p>I’m also going to make it so the GFX hit’s before it actually inflicts damage on you with the Ancient ice spells (Rush, burst, blitz, barrage), because thats how it is in RS.</p>
<p>I’m trying to get the combat as perfect to RS as possible ;).</p>
