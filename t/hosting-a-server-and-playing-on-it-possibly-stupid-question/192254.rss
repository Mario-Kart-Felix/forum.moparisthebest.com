    <description>Can you host a server and play on it? I host a server and it doesn&#39;t lag until about 30 people are on it, but whenever I try to log on and play on the host pc/connection it starts to lag insanely and everyone disconnects. What&#39;s the issue?

<p>So it’s not normal to lag while playing on the server and hosting it at the same time?
