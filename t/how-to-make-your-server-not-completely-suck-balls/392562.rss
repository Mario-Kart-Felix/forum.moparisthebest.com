[u][b][size=12pt]Disclaimer[/size][/b][/u]

This is not a troll, and I had no intention of trolling whatsoever, I just think that people honestly need to see this.


[b]Purpose:[/b] To make your server not completely suck!
[b]Difficulty:[/b] 0/10
[b]Tested On:[/b] All servers
[b]Directed Toward:[/b] Idiots who can&#39;t run/program a server.


[u][b][size=12pt]Common sense[/size][/b][/u]

If you don&#39;t have common sense, your server will fail, simple as that.
You can get common sense by:

[ul][li]Going to school regularly[/li]
[li]Taking a break from the computer once and awhile and going out with friends.[/li]
[li]Listening to people who obviously know what they are talking about[/li][/ul]


Just a few examples.


[u][b][size=12pt]Java[/size][/b][/u]

Complete this whole guide, then come back to rsps.
It can be found [url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html]here[/url].

Read up kids.


[u][b][size=12pt]Listen[/size][/b][/u]

Blake, Graham, Yz85racer, super_, etc.
Their word is law.

Most of those people have been in the RSPS Scene for a very long time and obviously know what they are talking about.

Most have the Java Guru status.

Any questions feel free to pm someone else about it and not me!</description>
