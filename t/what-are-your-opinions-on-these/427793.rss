    <title>What are your opinions on these</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-are-your-opinions-on-these/427793</link>
    <description>so im planing on making a mmorpg with a assasins creed twist so im woundering what would be better:

3D MMORPG Engines:
[u][b]Realmcrafter [/b][/u]
My personal favorite. This engine was the answer to my prayers. Not only is this engine priced dramatically lower then its competitors, it offers a more advanced, user friendly, and speedy interface, along with multiple editors to create everything from trees and rocks to the gui and the terrain in your game. There are 2 versions of Realmcrafter. The Standard Version which runs on DirectX7, it is the current and stable version with games currently being developed on it, and soon in the future the Pro version of Realmcrafter will be released, which runs of DirectX9 and has all the eyecandy you could ask for. This engine allows for source modification to make your ultimate unique MMORPG. I would say that through all my searching this is the Ultimate MMORPG Creation Engine.

2D MMORPG Engines:
[u][b]Eclipse   [/b][/u]
Eclipse is a commonly used 2D MMORPG Engine which comes with everything you need to make your MMORPG, all you do is go into the editors, make your maps, set up how characters and monsters work, put them into the game and there you have it. This engine has alot of spin offs which I will not put. This engine has a forum which can help you in the game development. For people skilled in coding there is a source version available for further customization.

[u][b]XtremeWorlds    [/b][/u]
Basically the same thing as Eclipse but I believe it has more features and is a less common engine then Eclipse which would probobly make it a better choice.

[u][b]Torque[/b][/u]
A more advanced game engine which requires a good amount of knowledge of programming. This engine is more expensive and difficult to work with than Realmcrafter and does not come with the tools which RC offers.</description>
