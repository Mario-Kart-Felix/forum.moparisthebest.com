    <description>Hi there Mopar, 

I&#39;ve being developing this current project for just under a year now, and it&#39;s finally coming to the final stages.
Basically, what my project is, is a website which teachers can create, edit and delete exams on. Also a place where students can sit the exams which they&#39;re invited too. 
There is a lot more functionality then that. But what i&#39;ll do is for every photo, i&#39;ll give you a run down on what the specific page does.

What I want you to help me with is the design, I know the design is awful I just need some help rearranging and redesigning some pages.
I want it to be as user friendly as possible, and not be a eye sore. I am only going to show the pages I believe need redesigning, when this is turned into a live version for my school, I will allow you access to a version if you&#39;d like. It&#39;s only two pages at the moment.

Navigation Page - Pretty self explanatory, this is a big one that needs work because as you can see it&#39;s an awful looking navigation page and it&#39;s quite confusing to navigate through and it&#39;s ugly.

Invite Page - This page is where teachers invite students to sit test&#39;s that they have previously created. They can also invite a classroom of students which they populate on another page.
