    <title>Need Assistants with AutoCacheDownloader......DeathlyPVPz</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-assistants-with-autocachedownloader-deathlypvpz/540687</link>
    <description>Heya, new to the site and need a bit of help.
Problem is, I have a cache uploaded to dropbox, and am trying to test it to download to my C:/ Drive.
Heres what I did.
1: Changed the background. (Same Size as first one)
2: Zipped the files inside of the cache (Not the folder itself)
3: Uploaded to dropbox.
4: Copied the link after upload was complete, then pasted into the cachedownloader where it belongs.

The problem is.

When I run the client, it says on the CMD window.(Also On the screen it says) &quot;Connection error, retrying in 5.4.3.2.1, Then restarts&quot;

java.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\Users\Akbar\SilentX\Data\Maps\mapConfig.txt (The system cann
ot find the path specified)
at java.io.FileInputStream.open(Native Method)
at java.io.FileInputStream.&lt;init&gt;(FileInputStream.jav a:138)
at java.io.FileInputStream.&lt;init&gt;(FileInputStream.jav a:97)
at java.io.FileReader.&lt;init&gt;(FileReader.java:58)
at client.setNewMaps(client.java:176)
at client.startUp(client.java:8302)
at RSApplet.run(RSApplet.java:84)
at client.run(client.java:5291)
at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:722)


Now, you may be thinking that it isn&#39;t finding the file &quot;mapConfig.txt&quot; and is a simple fix, However.
The file is in the proper location as above, and Is also named the exact same.
Another problem with it, (Which might be the reason for all this), is when I run the client, It&#39;s supposed to download the entire cache?
Which means sprites, the data folder, and the raw folder, (Not to mention the accual cache files). Right?
Well it isn&#39;t, and I don&#39;t know why. all it is downloading is the main cache files. it isn&#39;t downloading any of the folders, such as raw, maps, and sprites

Here are some screenshots of my Cachedownloader.java/Signlink.java/and the Cache itself.

              <p>Same problem. PLEASE comment on my post if you figure this out.<br>
<em><strong><em>UPDATED</em></strong><br>
<strong><strong>FIXED</strong></strong></em><br>
In my signlink.java folder, I changed:<br>
"/YouCacheNameHere/";<br>
to:<br>
“YourCacheNameHere/”;<br>
Just needed to delete the first “/”. It downloaded perfectly.</p>
