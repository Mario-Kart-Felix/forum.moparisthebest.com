    <title>Server &quot;Buy X&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-buy-x/335759</link>
    <description>I followed a tutorial on how to buy x and I came up with this :

So, It&#39;s not finding the symbol in my client.classfile. It doesn&#39;t mess up the buy but I was wondering how to fix.

And also it disconnects when u buy a certain amount of items say 500 items.

At the bottom it sais u need to have free slots open, so I was wondering if that was causing the d/c and how can I get rid of it.</description>
