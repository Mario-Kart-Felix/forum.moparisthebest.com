    <title>Lost old account</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lost-old-account/433089</link>
    <description>Hey I lost my old moparscape account (there was some kind of site wide password reset or something if I remember right), it was liked with my old email and was ISP based that I no longer have access to (I moved since the account&#39;s creation). Who can I contact to get the account back? I can provide proof I am the account owner (I know the old password, have emails archived, have an IP in the same general area (different city but probably about a 30 minute-45 minute drive from where I lived previously), etc).</description>
