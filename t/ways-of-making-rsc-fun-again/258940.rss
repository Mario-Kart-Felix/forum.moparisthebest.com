    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ways-of-making-rsc-fun-again/258940</link>
    <description>Heres an idea i generated through a bunch of different games put together that may make gameplay fun, would like some of your input on it (and no stealing my ideas)

-------Rebirth System + Master Skills System-----------------------------------------------------------
*Combat level is ONLY calculated on Atk/Def/Str/HP.
*3 Master skills (Prayer, Ranged and Magic) Only 1 will be aquired per character each time they rebirth.

*Rebirth system, (Once a player has reached combat level 100, and done a very hard quest, they will be Reborn. Meaning all their combat stats get reset back to level 1, but they gain a master skill. Nobody will be able to use a master skill until they have done this.

This would be the outcome:

 a character that was level 80, and had say 70atk 70str 70def and 70hp. + a Reborn character that had 70 atk 70 str 70 def and 70hp, as well as 70magic (magic being his master skill from rebirth) both the same combat level still. can both attack each other in wilderness (and obviously the person who was reborn has the upper hand)

This would make training longer, more fun, the wilderness more suprising, and a new meaning to the word Pure.

Pkers will have to figure out which may be the best master skill to go with a pker etc.

-----------Legendary Weapons---------------------------------------------------------------------------

a Monster will drop a legendary weapon &quot;Legendary Rune-2-handed Sword(+1)&quot;

+1 is the level of composition this item holds, there will only be selected legendary weapons, and instead of rewriting the entire item system client/server sided, id make say 8 different Legendary Rune-2-handed Swords(range from +1 to +9)

Each extra composition level on a characters weapon will increase their weapon damage and aim, by 10% as well as increasing armor by 3%.

PlayerA obtains a Legendary Rune-2-Handed sword(+1) from a monster, to Compose this to +2, he has to do a  medium-hard quest, there will be 8 quests, all ranking from medium to hard, to compose up to a +9 rune-2 handed sword.

It will not be easy to compose, and will have a &quot;Cooldown&quot; on composition, even if you do complete a composition quest you will not be able to upgrade your weapon again until 72 hours have passed (so some rich guy doesn&#39;t create a +9 in a day)

This here for create newer type of weapons, and enough of the R2H being the best weapon (f2p).

              <p>Now, I like the ideas that you’ve brought up, but my heart still belongs to the original rsc.<br>
Don’t get me wrong, I’d play something like what you’ve suggested, but I don’t think everyone would.<br>
Been said times before, rscd was popular because of being the first rsc-like server.<br>
This should be the first rsc-like server that’s better than the original rsc.<br>
When dealing with anything, rules must be enforced, when you bend rules and someone finds out, all hell brakes loose.<br>
Heres what I’m saying, you cheat, you get an IP ban.<br>
Of course IP addresses can be changed, but that’s not the point.<br>
You ban the account and you ban the IP, if they feel like they want to start all over, sure, let them.<br>
When you know the rules and you don’t follow them, there is NO excuse to breaking them.<br>
In my eyes, breaking rules is what ruins good servers.<br>
The following of the rules is all up to the community, if they want to play the server, they will not break rules.<br>
If the management wants people to play the server, they should not make rules that noone is going to follow.<br>
For example, there have been a couple of servers where people have been banned for account sharing.<br>
Now, this might seem a shady thing to do, but to get ahead in a rsc server, account sharing is a must, since we all know, smithing is what creates the economy.<br>
Sorry for rambling too long.</p>
<p>The conclusion, it’s not the content that’s not popular, it’s the management.</p>

              <p>Beyond that, how about an experience system similar to WoW’s where you cannot auto on level 10 npcs to gain linear experience without threat of death?</p>
<p>Latifundio posted a rough experience change but it would need much greater refinement before it could be used:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public static int combatExperience(Mob mob) { 
    double exp = (Math.pow(mob.getCombatLevel(), 2) * 0.7) + 20D; 
    return (int) (mob instanceof Player ? (exp / 4D) : exp); 
    }</code></pre>
<blockquote>Note: This goes in formulae.java and need to replace the old formula. 
Note2: If using an overall exp rate higher than x1 then you should divide .7 and 20 by the number of the new xp rate.
For Ex. an exp rate of x10 then it should be like this (Math.pow(mob.getCombatLevel(), 2) * 0.07) + 2D;
<p>Note that the giant rat being 10 combat lvls higher than the chicken, had less xp than fighting 2 chickens (26 x 2 = 52). But on the new formula fighting that rat gives gives the xp of fighting 4 chickens (26x4 = 104) so even pures are gaining more xp since rats are an easy foe (and u know many train their pures on scorpions or even pirates and that is much better xp with this new formula).</p>
<p>And that’s what i want they keep moving-on on better training places leaving the chickens for the new comers (back at rsc chickens,goblins and man were all the time botted, leaving new players without a place to train).</p>

<p>It will not be easy to compose, and will have a “Cooldown” on composition, even if you do complete a composition quest you will not be able to upgrade your weapon again until 72 hours have passed (so some rich guy doesn’t create a +9 in a day)</p>
<p>This here for create newer type of weapons, and enough of the R2H being the best weapon (f2p).</p>
