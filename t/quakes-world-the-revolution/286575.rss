Okay, to start off i would just like to say a few things.

The point of this server is to make a delta based server like no other, now i am not saying it&#39;s going to be the best, but i am aiming for making this server that is unique from the other delta servers.

Quake&#39;s World is going to be different because of the features and how they work in it. Lets take Clan Wars for example, i have been working on Clan Wars for about a week now, and i am trying to make it different from all over servers.

EDIT: As soon as i fix my [b][u]Dial-up[/b][/u] internet all pictures will be posted.

[size=20pt][b]FORUMS[/size]

Currently i am working on some forums, now they are free for use, but i am trying to get some money for a domain.


[size=20pt][b]Mini Games[/size]

Mini Games on Quake&#39;s World have to be one of my main projects because i&#39;m attempting to add every Runescape one or something very similar. Here&#39;s a list of what i have so far.

[b]Rogue&#39;s Den - [/b]60%
Now i have made all of the doors, and objects in the Rouge&#39;s Den mini game work. The idea of this is to use your Thieving and Agility skills to get through the maze, so an example is you will need a certain thieving level to open a chest, and when you open it there&#39;s a key, you use it on the door, and it lets you through, it&#39;s that sort of concept, and the closer you get to the reward, the higher the level you will need to be in Thieving and Agility. I am still working on making it so there&#39;s an interface on the top right of the screen stating that you have how ever much time remaining, and when you run out of time you teleport back to the rogues den. Right now when you click the chest it adds the rogue clothes to your inventory and sends an itemmessage.

[b]Duel Arena - [/b]35%
I haven&#39;t really started this yet, all i have added is the challenge option on a player when at the duel arena, the dueling interfaces, and making it so you keep your items. I am still working on adding working staking, making the interface teleport you, and making it so when you kill the other player it teleports you back to the duel arena. I may also start my spectating, right now all i have is a command for it, which works by typing ::spectate and it teleports you to the spectate area of the duel arena, nothing special.

[b]Clan Wars - [/b]80%
Basically this works like runescape but it&#39;s slightly different. Right now i have added the portals where you need to be wearing a certain team cape, so i made the red and blue team capes allowed to enter one portal, and the yellow, green, and pink allowed to enter the other (sorta like castle wars but not really.) Now i based the fighting area off runescape where you get the key for the blue dragons, so when you die you get teleported there. I&#39;m still making it so you can&#39;t go back in the clan wars portal, making it so there&#39;s a waiting limit to fight, and making a challenge option in the clan wars area.

[b]Bounty Hunter - [/b]45%
Decided to make this because of requests on my forum. Basically how this goes is there will be a cave entrance, giving you 3 options of telepoting to either the low level crater, the medium level crater, and the high level crater. After you choose one it will give you a warning telling you it&#39;s not a safe area. You can&#39;t teleport out of the bounty hunter arenas, and i am working on adding some type of a target thing.

[b]Castle Wars - [/b]85%
This works pretty much works like runescape, you enter either the zamorak or the saradomin portal then you get teleported to the waiting area, and you can&#39;t be wearing a hat or a cape. When you teleport to the waiting area your team hood and cape get&#39;s added to your inventory. When your in the castle wars game, i added the interfaces in but they don&#39;t work too well, so the point of it is exactly like runescape, i made it so when you click the flag it adds it to your inventory. I also made it so when you click the guthix portal it teleports you to either the zamorak or saradomin waiting room. I am still working on adding the time until the next round, time until round starts, the hit icon on the flag carrier. I am struggling to make it so when you click the guthix portal it teleports you to either zamorak or saradomin waiting rooms, i can&#39;t figure out how to make it add the right hood and cape, so it adds both :s.


[b]Fight pits - [/b]100%
Fight pits is 100% working, the entrance vent&#39;s work perfectly, you don&#39;t loose items, i added the dialouge for the tzhaar npc so when the game starts it appears, i added the time to next round in the waiting room, and when you win the red skull appears above your head, and gives you a nice little reward. I am working on adding the time reaming in the fight pits game, the winner doesn&#39;t teleport out of the mini game after the round is over, and making the viewing orb work.

[b]Pest control - [/b]100%
I did basically no work on this, it already worked on the delta source, i just topped it up a little fixed a few bugs, i am still working on making it so the point exchange is like runescapes atm.

[b]Clue scrolls - [/b]70%
I have worked a little bit on these, it&#39;s rare to get clue scroll drops, but when you do there&#39;s usually just one clue and it&#39;s either a picture of where to dig, a picture of who to talk to, or a picture of where to search. I am working on making the npc&#39;s say you have finished the clue scroll, and that&#39;s about it, i also have to make it so when you dig in a certain spot it gives you a casket with the reward.

[b]Barrows - [/b]80%
Barrows wasn&#39;t really that much work, i basically just made a way better base for it then the regular delta version. Right now you use your spade on the chambers and it sends you into the correct barrows brother lair, you click on the casket and the barrows brother appears. Nothing special at all, i am still progressing to add a hiticon on the barrows brothers, making it talk when appearing, the tunnel and chest method work properly.

[b]Barbarian Assault - [/b]100%
For this i decided it was time for a change, i was getting sick and tired of the fight arena type thing going on. So i moved Barbarian assault to a better area that looked more like the actual thing adn it was more open. I also changed the npcs because the ones in the original delta base weren&#39;t even close.

[b]Blast Furnace - [/b]10%
I decided to actual make a mini-game 100% based off runescape, so i started with this one. This one is basically almost identical to the runescape versions, it&#39;s just a little less long, and a little more easier to understand and do. I have used the Blast furnace interfaces and have the right coordinates for this project, this is my main project atm.

[b]Buthorpe Games room - [/b]55%
Now for this mini-game i mainly used interfaces and cases, it&#39;s very easy to understand. I have currently completed 2 of the 4 types of games (Runelink, and Draughts.) For Runelink you type ::challenge (PLAYERNAME) and the Runelink options interface pops up, now you pick your team, time per move, and click challenge. (The ranked option doesn&#39;t work for now.) Basically for Runelink you try and get 4 runes in a row, but there&#39;s a few bugs, the main one is when you get 4 in a row your account disconnects. (I have no idea why.) For Draughts, it works like runescape, basically it&#39;s chess with runes, you choose your team, and click offer bet, now this is like staking, so just type in 1000. There is the same bug with Draughts as there is Runelink.

[b]Shooting star - [/b]99%
This is also based very similar to runescape. So this one isn&#39;t the same as runescapes, it&#39;s slightly different. In hidden places around the server there&#39;s some rocks that when you mine them you get ashes, and next to the rock there is an npc who gives you some money, runes, and some other random things after you have mined 28 ashes from the rock. You can only mine up to 28 ashes, and you can only talk to the npc after you have 28 ashes, after that you can talk to the alien but he only says, &quot;Thanks for getting me the ashes!&quot; The object id&#39;s are all different too, so you can&#39;t ever abuse this mini game, and every week i will add the ores to new places for you to find. I have added it so when you click the telescope it shows the shooting star interface, and also another chatbox interface giving you a hint of where one of the rocks is. I am working on making it give you a random hint every time.

[b]Soul Wars - [/b]0%
I have this all thought out, but haven&#39;t started it yet. There&#39;s going to be an open area with 2 portals, you enter one portal and it teleports you to the blue team, you enter the other portal, it teleports you to the red team. I am going to use the Castle Wars mini-game base for this, it&#39;s going to be similar but you will get points for killing npc&#39;s and killing other players. If your team wins you will get 5 trading sticks, which can be traded in for experience and items, i am planning on using the pest control point exchange interface.

[b]Fishing Trawler - [/b]30%
Now this is only a tiny bit based off runescape, most of it is my ideas. For this mini-game you will need to talk to murphy, he will explain part of it. I also made him have a trade option with the supplies you will need which is swamp paste, ropes, and bailing buckets. At the moment all i have is the interface which doesn&#39;t work, and when you use the paste of the hole it repairs it and gives you fishing experience, i am still trying to think this out.

[b]Trouble Brewing - [/b]100%
Now this has basically nothing to do with runescapes version, i made my own little version. This is a very complex mini-game, and took a lot of work. The main things in this quest is making alcohol it&#39;s sorta like a quest, but can be done many times, and is more rewarding. So first you get assigned a task to make a beer, you get the ingredients the pirate says which is random for everyone, and you bring it back to him, then he will keep telling you to get certain ingredients to make certain liquor and as the mini-game goes on the harder it is to get the ingredients, you also need at least 99 Herblore and 99 Thieving to complete this. The rewards are the same as runescape which are consist of naval costumes.[/b]

[b]Ghostly robes - [/b]100%
Decided to make this a mini-game because it&#39;s fun and based off runescape. For this mini-game you have to go looking for the ghosts and they give you ghostly robes, exactly the same as runescape. I have made it so that you need to be wearing the ring of invisibility to talk to the ghosts.

[b]Bar Crawl - [/b]100%
This has to be the easiest mini-game in my server, basically you go to every bar in every major city and buy a beer from the beer store there, go back to the Barbarian Agility course, talk to the barbarian there, and he allows you to use the Barbarian Agility course.

[b]Mogres - [/b]0%
I have this based out exactly like runescape. You get skippy the hang-over cure by making it with 32 herblore, then you use fishing explosives with the fishing spot, and the mogre appears, kill them for flippers and mudskipper hats. I am planning on adding a hiticon.



[size=20pt][b]Server[/size]

This is the part of the thread where it&#39;s server features such as Skills, Npc&#39;s, and Transportation, etc.

[size=20pt][b]Skills - [/size] These are the following skills that are on the server along with percent rates.[/b]

Melee - 100%
Ranged - 100%
Magic - 100%
Prayer - 0% - Just deleted the shitty delta base of prayer, and starting a new one.
Runecrafting - 100%
Cooking - 100%
Fishing - 100%
Firemaking - 65%
Fletching - 50%
Herblore - 80%
Agility - 95%
Slayer - 0% - Starting a new base of slayer.
Woodcutting - 100%
Mining - 100%
Smithing &amp; Smelting - 40% - Working on a brand new Smithing base.
Farming - 0% - Going to delete the shitty delta base of farming, and start my own base.

[size=20pt][b]Quests[/size]

The Quests in this server are based 100% on Runescape, i have re-created them and made the bases for them more stable. They are shortened and hardened. There is currently only 11 quests, i am still working on a few but i will not explain yet because i have not started the new ones.


[size=20pt][b]Npc&#39;s and Monsters[/b][/size]


[b]Populated areas:[/b]

The following areas are populated with the correct npc&#39;s in the correct locations.

Lumbridge - 100%
Varrock - 100%
Falador - 100%
Camelot - 100%
Catherbay - 100%
Ardougne- 75%
Trollheim - 50%
Taverly - 0%
Buthrope - 100%
Watchtower - 100%
Yanille - 60%
Rogue&#39;s Den - 100%

These are basically the areas i have now, still constructively working on it.

[b]Npc dialogues[/b]

I have basically added Dialogues to every npc with the talk option. Even if they are made only for certain things, they still have a very stable base for dialogues.

[b]Boss monsters - I have added the following boss monsters with the correct percentage rates.[/b]


Dagannoth Kings - 100%
Kalphite Queen - 0% - Decided to restart this boss monster, and start it from scratch.
King Black Dragon - 100%
Chaos Elemental - 100%

[i]I am trying my best to work on the boss monsters in my server, i really think they need upgrades which is why i restarted the kalphite queen base.[/i]


[size=20pt][b]Guilds[/size]

So i have seen in some servers they have certain guilds working properly, so i decided to add them too, but actually full.

Warriors guild - 0% - There isn&#39;t any map data for this so i am working on making an additional add on.
Legends guild - 100%
Heroes guild - 100%
Cooking guild - 99%
Fishing guild - 80%
Ranging guild - 100%
Magic guild - 100%
Crafting guild - 0% - Working on this from scratch because there was originally a jail there.
Mining - 0% - Working on this from scratch to, adding additional ores and other add on&#39;s.

[b]Skill masters[/b]

Basically the point of skill masters is so when you reach a 99 skill there&#39;s an item message stating to go see that master.
I have found the correct models, and i have fixed them a little bit because a lot of them were glitched.


[size=20pt][b]Transportation[/b][/size]

This is my newest base, i am re-creating the transportation system meaning objects, and interface transportation.

Gnome glider - 100%
Canoe transportation - 0% - The interface is already built in, i am just gonna make it work from scratch.
Row boat transportation - 0% - Again with this one, starting from scratch starting with the interface.
Amulet of Glory - 100%
Games Necklace - 0% - Re-creating this base and making it more stable with better transportation.
Ring of Dueling - 0% - Re-doing this because it is great transportation but is very unstable.

              <p>Thanks mate, this project is far from the old runescape but it has many of the same features, and in this server it takes about 2 weeks to max your combat stats, and about 2 days to get 1 99, so it’s pretty good.</p>

Thank god this does look well based off the old runescape and I wish you all the luck in the world. Make the old runescape prowd!</p>

Looks alright. I’ll have to stop you when you say “Make a unique Delta based server”. I’d go with a new base, there’s no such thing as a ‘Unique Delta’ source. Why? Combat is already perfect, ranged is perfect, magic is perfect, most Delta’s are just a few new shops added and a new home place.<br>

DeltaScape’s combat is <span class="bbcode-b">far</span> from perfect.[/quote]I agree with Jc, there is many bugs and glitches with it’s combat system. Ddsowns, i know what i mean by that.</p>
