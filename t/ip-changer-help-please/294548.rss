    <description>I know there are many of these out there and I have looked through them to no prevail. I have changed the Setserver and Port in the Client.Java and I have changed the &quot;&quot; in the EGUI.java file and It is still connecting to 127.0.0.1!

Anything else that I need to change please post.

Thank you.
