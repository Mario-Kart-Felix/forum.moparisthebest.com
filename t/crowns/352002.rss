    <title>Crowns</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/crowns/352002</link>
    <description>Uhmm, I&#39;ve looked around for like 1 hour to find a simple tut on how to add custom crowns.  I have an owner img, but I don&#39;t know how to make it show up in the client.  I also had an idea where you use mw2 prestige crowns next to the name for every player, 10 prestige modes last three are for staff.  So can anyone help me with this please?</description>
