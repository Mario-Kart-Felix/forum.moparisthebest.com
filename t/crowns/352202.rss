    <title>Crowns</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/crowns/352202</link>
    <description>I have an idea of giving players crowns.  Next to their name like admin and mod crowns.  So, I have this thing on my server where they can go into prestige mode on my server.  But, I want to add prestige crowns when they go into prestige mode.  And I want to make my owner crown work in the server.  I already have the crown, but how do I make it show up for player rights = 3?  This is 317 dleta base(I don&#39;t give a shit what you think about delta base&#39;s).</description>
