That happens when I try to change the crown. I&#39;m trying to make playerRights 4 an admin and playerRights 5 a mod. 5 has no crown, and 4 has a donor sign. I looked through and I changed everything in my client.java to the modIcon 4 and modIcon 5 pic, which is set correctly, as modIcon 4 is an admin crown and modIcon 5 is a mod crown. Please help me with adding these crowns.</description>
