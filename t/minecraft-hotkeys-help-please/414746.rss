    <title>Minecraft Hotkeys - Help Please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/minecraft-hotkeys-help-please/414746</link>
    <description>Wasn&#39;t sure where I should post this to be honest, but this seemed like the most fitting section for it in my eyes.
Basically, I&#39;d just like to know how I could enable hot keys for minecraft and other games such as Runescape and things like that, on my old windows 7 computer they worked fine but on my new windows 7 (lap top) I&#39;m not sure how to toggle them for games as of right now they do things like control the brightness of my screen or volume of my computer and honestly I don&#39;t need any of that.

I&#39;ve searched google several times but no luck there, if you could help it&#39;d be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance, Acorn_</description>

              <p>It was probably a setting your old laptop had from the factory or a 3rd party program. Doesnt come as a feature in win7.</p>
