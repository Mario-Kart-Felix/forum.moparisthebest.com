    <title>How to put Private Server on a hosted website?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-put-private-server-on-a-hosted-website/407294</link>
    <description>I have successfully got several private servers setup and running locally on my pc with the port forwarding and all so that others can connect outside the network. Running our server this way has outgrown our pc and it just can&#39;t keep up anymore. So, I purchased a %^&amp;*#@%^.info and have it hosted at godaddy dot com.

I need to know if there are any tutorials out there on how to set our server up on the .info website so we can do away with the no-ip.biz ..... We also have a vBulletin forum setup already on the .info.....

Any help will be greatly appreciated!!!</description>

<p>Now next question…</p>
<p>How do you start the compiler and run-server.bats from within your hosted site?? I uploaded our private server files but now when I browse to …/compile.bat it gives me a 404 Error page!!! Also get the same error when trying to run any .bat file…</p>
