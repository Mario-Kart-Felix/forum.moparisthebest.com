    <title>My first rs private server and idk how to start running it</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-first-rs-private-server-and-idk-how-to-start-running-it/445308</link>
    <description>I downloaded some client/server stuff from the forums but idk what to do with them and have been looking at tutorials all day and i need some help to get the server running at least. I downloaded some and in the tutorials people have like a launcher and stuff that starts the server and i cant find one, i dont know if i have the right java stuff either. I need some help with getting started on one and i can start helping people with the same problem as me and maybe become good at this stuff. Just need some basic help, but its crucial too so i can get started.</description>
