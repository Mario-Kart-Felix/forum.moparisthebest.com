    <title>Server connection problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-connection-problem/376371</link>
    <description>hello, i have had my server running for many months then i got bored and decided to shut it down. recently i decided i want to start it back up again but it wont work. i think the problem might be my no-ip but im not entirely sure. I know for a fact that my port forwarding is correct as it used to work and all my ips and ports r set correctly in source and client but it still wont work. anyone have any idea what could be wrong?</description>
