    <description>Hi mopar community!

I know this probably gets asked soooo much, but im having problems setting my computer up so people can connect to me and can figure out why.

I have port forwarded using utorrent as my router doesnt seem to want to do it itself, probably cause its an ISP privided router with a strict built-in firewall. but using utorrent work perfectly and the port checker website says its open. 

I am using no-ip with the server address koreylawless.ddns.net and have set this in my client.java file on the client i want to use and it doesnt not work. i have also tried it with an ip-changing client still to no avail :(

I decided to download hamachi and try with that and it works flawlessly, but i think people wont want to play a server through hamachi so would love to get it working with no-ip.

If anyone can help me i would be in your debt, my skype is koreylawlesss if that will be better for anyone to contact me on.

Thanks guys, sorry for posting a question that i know annoys people!</description>
