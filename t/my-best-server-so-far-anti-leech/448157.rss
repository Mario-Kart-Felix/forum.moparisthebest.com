    <description>dowload links:
server: *
client:  *
cache:  *


The Making:
I start out a long while back with MITB 317 renamed client
I knew little to slim about renamed clients, plus with not alot of tuts out their it pushed me to learn.
I started out with this client by trying to add sprites, which i soon found out how to do.
I can change any sprite on the client I wish.
Next I went for the good old JFrame.
I followed DJ Iceys tut and fixed the error by myself by reading the exceptions it was really quiet simple.
Next I added a censor option.
Once that was done I added the good old Music player.
I wasn&#39;t done there quiet yet. I didn&#39;t like 317 cache plus I didnt like custom items. Their anoying and really gay.
I tried working my way threw to load 377 cache but it just didnt work out. Always got the count down error.
I asked galkon about it and he told me to change a line in a class and what do you know? It worked *slaps knee*.
Now the max item is 7955 instead of 7620 i beleive?
Version 1 was only released on my servers site


Features:
417 game frame
377 cache
JFrame
Censor option - deafult off
HP above heads. Took forever to get this to work.
Music Player
Server and Ip switicher 100% working
Object, Item, And Npcs list - Thanks to mitb
Moving fire cape
High detail - some what
Money changes colors at 1k 100k 1mill ect..
sorry for the little amount of pics....</description>
