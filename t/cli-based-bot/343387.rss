    <title>CLI Based Bot</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cli-based-bot/343387</link>
    <description>Hello, i was just wondering if it was somehow possible to create a bot(maybe just an updater to start) solely based of the CLI.

Let me clarify what I&#39;m trying to do. I want to create a bot, or even just a modified client, that you can control solely through the command prompt. So for example you could do:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Please enter a command:
login
Username:
Zymus
Password:
somepassword

Attempting to login...
Successfully logged in: Zymus
Current Location: X=3200, Y=3200, Height=0
/walk 3220, 3200
Walking to 3220, 3200...
Arrived at destination.
/walk 3400, 9999
Invalid coordinates: Couldn&#39;t calculate path.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Or something along those lines. This could be impossible with the current revisions, due to the class loading in the client, but I&#39;m willing to give it a shot in the current revision, or possible a previous revision. Any thoughts?</description>

No.  RSA encryption relies on the public key being, well, public.  This is the key that is in the client.  The private key is only known to jagex and is in their servers, because using the private key is the only way to decrypt the data that was encrypted with the public key.  If we had both we would be in fat city because we could decrypt/re-encrypt everything on the line and gain access to everything.<br>

<p>If you just want to have the data, you can generate a pair of RSA keys your self. Change the RSA public key in the RS client with your own generated key. Make a ‘proxy’ and let the rs client connect to your proxy and let that your proxy bot decrypt the data with your self generated private key and re-encrypt it with the public key from the rs client and send it to the RS Servers.</p>
<p>That isn’t that hard…</p>
<p>Dunno where i got that info of 2 keys but i always tought the RS Client had 2 keys. 1 public en encrypt messages to send to server and 1 private to decrypt messages from server.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s right, but I already said that in this thread:</p>
<p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:21, topic:343387”][quote author=zyle1992 link=topic=439784.msg3232367#msg3232367 date=1276194805]<br>
Ya, i think I’m going to make a packet/proxy bot(as suggested). My only question is that would i need to edit the the application each time rs updates, or would i basically just use a sort of pattern recognition to determine which packets are which?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Id say it’d be almost impossible to keep a packet bot updated. Not only do the packet ids change, the order of the payloads get swapped around, and you have to edit the client to change the RSA keys and get the ones from the client to use in your bot.  It’s simply not worth it.  It would be easier to use a conventional updater and disable the graphics.[/quote]</p>

Last time I checked packet bots weren’t just for avoiding the running of the “big beefy client”, but also for the manipulation the protocol and the exploiting of any bugs in that protocol, remember the massive party hat duplications? What about banking in the wilderness? Lots of things that can be done, but then again, since most of the known exploits are fixed it is in fact a little pointless.</p>

<p>i just gave him a method to get in fat city <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> without cracking the private key.</p>
<p>AutoRune also required to run the RS Client. It was in fact just a simple SOCKS proxy.</p>
<p>However to make a new AutoRune clone you don’t need to do all this shit…<br>
As said before only the login block with the seeds for the ISAAC cipher are encrypted with RSA<br>
What you can do is get the Public RSA key from the RS Client trough Reflection, Decompiling, …<br>
Get the RS Client connect trough your proxy (i suggest doing it with DNS Poisoning, since RS uses hostnames to connect to their servers as far is i know).<br>
Let the RS Client do the login. And every packet you recieve from the RS Server you decrypt using the RSA key in the client. Let the proxy watch out for the seeds for the ISAAC cipher and save them if found. And send the original encrypted package to the RS Client.<br>
Once you have the seeds there is no more RSA encryption used. So from here you should use ISAAC to decrypt the traffic which shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Above is a method to make a working proxy bot without editting the client…</p>
<p>I wish i had some more time so i could make a PoC =(</p>

<p>No.  RSA encryption relies on the public key being, well, public.  This is the key that is in the client.  The private key is only known to jagex and is in their servers, because using the private key is the only way to decrypt the data that was encrypted with the public key.  If we had both we would be in fat city because we could decrypt/re-encrypt everything on the line and gain access to everything.</p>

</aside>
<p>If you just want to have the data, you can generate a pair of RSA keys your self. Change the RSA public key in the RS client with your own generated key. Make a ‘proxy’ and let the rs client connect to your proxy and let that your proxy bot decrypt the data with your self generated private key and re-encrypt it with the public key from the rs client and send it to the RS Servers.</p>
<p>That isn’t that hard…</p>
<p>Dunno where i got that info of 2 keys but i always tought the RS Client had 2 keys. 1 public en encrypt messages to send to server and 1 private to decrypt messages from server.</p>

              <p>A packet bot is hard but it should be doable.<br>
I wanted to develop a packet bot a while back. but since i had not enough time for i had to give up the project.<br>
However i did some testing i found 2 ways of making a packet bot.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Java Hook Packet Bot. (never tested this one)<br>
99% that jagex built in a function to send and recieve packets to the server in the client which do all the encryption. What you can do is simply hook them and you can insert packages.<br>
This has ofcourse a few downsides… you still need to run the client which uses a lot of unnecessary resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Full packet bot.<br>
In this case you have to deal with a lot of more problems first of all the RSA encryption. As i just read above it uses a 4096-bit encryption… Those keys are uncrackeable by all known computers these days. it would take up too 100’s of years… In the RS client there are 2 RSA keys 1 public and 1 private. the public on is to decrypt the recieved data from server the private one is to encrypt the data to send to the server. RSA is only used for the login block. but in the login block you will also recieve the seed for your ISAAC cipher. which is used to encrypt all the other data in you connection after you passed the login. ISAAC cipher uses 256 int32’s so this way you can reconize it. it might be that jagex updated to ISAAC-64? in this case there are 256 int64 used.<br>
For a C implementation of ISAAC i suggest reading this page: <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll this is info i got while i was trying to develop my packet bot.<br>
Hope this could help others.</p>
