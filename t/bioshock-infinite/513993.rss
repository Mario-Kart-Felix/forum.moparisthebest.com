    <title>Bioshock: Infinite</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bioshock-infinite/513993</link>
    <description>I just finished the game on Hard, that&#39;s why it took me a bit longer than everyone else. This will probably be my favorite game of 2013, a version of a ending was kind of hinted at throughout the game but I was suprised with the true ending. Overall I&#39;d give it a 9/10.

I didn’t expect it but came across some of the points and could never figure out what the ending was until I FINALLY got there - it was awesome.[/quote]I read a few blog posts that kind of explained the rifts a bit more, it made more sense after that. They kind of explained it poorly in the game but I guessing they did that just to get people thinking and using the imaginations to what the rifts were and what they meant. It should be Game of the Year 2013, or if not within the top 3.</p>
