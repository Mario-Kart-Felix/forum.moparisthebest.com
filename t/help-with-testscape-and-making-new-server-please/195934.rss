    <title>Help with TestScape and making new server please!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-testscape-and-making-new-server-please/195934</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m new. As you can tell by my name, I&#39;m terrible with comps :P. So anyway I was reading an insteresting post on how to make your own server and I needed a source... I&#39;ve heard many sources contain viruses and stuff so I was hoping i could get a link to a TestScape download becuz I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s very reliable. I also got to a point where I needed to enter my default gateway into the browser, now Im on a belkin F5D7231-4 and it asked me for a password once i reached the place, but I think the password has been customized and I was wonder if there was another way to get to it because my Parents are on holidays for 2 weeks and I don&#39;t know the password. So If there&#39;s anyway to help either of these probs help is greatly appreciated! If not, don&#39;t worry, you don&#39;t have to help me cuz I know it gets annoying helping noobs all the time.

I&#39;ll post more if I have any other probs... Hope youd don&#39;t mind lol :P</description>
