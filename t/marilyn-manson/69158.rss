    <title>Marilyn Manson</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/marilyn-manson/69158</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s one of my favorite songs by Marilyn Manson, teh Fight Song! (Yes, I am Gothic.)
http://youtube.com/watch?v=rZ74G4lU84I

And for those of you who thinks that Marilyn Manson is a loser who is just Gothic for no reason, you have alot to learn. He has had one of the worst childhood&#39;s anyone could have, raped by his neighbor or dad or whatever....
Also the Columbine High School Massacre was not his fault. Maybe if teenagers these days had self-control, there would be no killing. Blame it on the people who actually let teens get their hands on guns, most likely the parents have no control over the actions of their sons and daughters, letting them get out of control.
Do not blame Marilyn Manson for any mishaps from people listening to his music, it&#39;s their choices that make the mishaps, not his. They could just as well have done it anyways.
(BTW, I&#39;m not an emo Goth....)</description>

<p>False, he never actually murders anything. The most extreme thing he has ever done was burn fake bibles, or start riots during <span class="bbcode-b">his</span> concerts, but he keeps them under control and never wants anyone to really riot outside of his concerts from his music.</p>

Yeah, it’s all lies.<br>
If someone does something after listening to his music, it’s their fault, not his. He doesn’t choose their actions…<br>
I listen to his music and I’m probably the only person who deals with stuff in my school with common sense…</p>

<p>And for those of you who thinks that Marilyn Manson is a loser who is just Gothic for no reason, you have alot to learn. He has had one of the worst childhood’s anyone could have, raped by his neighbor or dad or whatever…<br>
Also the Columbine High School Massacre was not his fault. Maybe if teenagers these days had self-control, there would be no killing. Blame it on the people who actually let teens get their hands on guns, most likely the parents have no control over the actions of their sons and daughters, letting them get out of control.<br>
Do not blame Marilyn Manson for any mishaps from people listening to his music, it’s their choices that make the mishaps, not his. They could just as well have done it anyways.<br>
(BTW, I’m not an emo Goth…)</p>
