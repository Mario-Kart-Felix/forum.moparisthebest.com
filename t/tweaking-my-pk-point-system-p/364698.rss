    <title>Tweaking my PK-Point System :P</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tweaking-my-pk-point-system-p/364698</link>
    <description>i have working pk points in my server (demise pking, delta) and i believe its set up in the way that a certain shop is given the &quot;system&quot; and then the items are given values for kills, like 2, 5, etc. i took my donar shop and switched it (non donars can go in and donars cant lol) and it has a pvp values like the pk shop. it says kills too, like &quot;this item cost #$%#@!#$ kills.&quot; instead of coins, so thats step one. i put the pvp value &quot;item #### == 2&quot; (&lt;-- example) but when you click the item to see the value, it just takes the value of a working one that you clicked before. how could i make it stable? if you need any more info feel free to tell me, i tried my best atm explaining this :p</description>
