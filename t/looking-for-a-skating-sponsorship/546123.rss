I’ve been trying to throw together a Sponsor-Me video but can’t really find a video-recorder that is good enough to actually follow me and keep the camera at least a little steady.<br>

Then get a steady cam. Have you tried to run or skateboard with a camera and keep it steady?[/quote]</p>
<p>Me and my older brother use to do this all the time for fun before I actually started getting decent and it actually came out to look extremely good and smooth. He just went to his AIT for the second stage of his basic training though, so I guess I’ll have to go 3 months before I am able to throw together the video. But hey, the more practice, the better the shot of me getting someone to notice me.</p>

Been in the search for some local contests but in my location, there really is no skateparks that are as big as a normal sized lot for a house. There really are no contests that are hosted near me, which is a real bummer. The only skating I am able to get in is street because the skatepark closest to me is near a pool, and it’s smaller than the lot my house is sitting on (in a sub-divison, which really says something.)</p>

Youtube was intertwined with the whole “put your name out there” but yes.<br>
Youtube is a great way these days.</p>
