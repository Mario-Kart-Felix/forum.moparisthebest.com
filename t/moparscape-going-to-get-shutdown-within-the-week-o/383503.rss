<p>Your an idiot. The servers we make are NONE of Fagexs work. They really can’t touch us for making servers as we can continue to do that as long as we want. Moparisthebest kicked Fagexs ass before and I am sure he will do it again. Worst case scenario… we take down forums for a day, buy a box in china and yet… still host the forums. We aren’t going down so fuck you.</p>
