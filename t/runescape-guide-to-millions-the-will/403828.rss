 Flipping: Introduction

 Keeping it simple flipping is buying an item at one price and selling it for a different, higher price. In the example below, the buy price is highlighted in red and the sell price in yellow

 There are many items you can choose from to flip. Here is a list of regularly flipped items:

Saradomin sword                     Kingly implings 
Dragon bones                            Sharks (raw + cooked)
Whips                                        Runes  
Monkfish (raw + cooked)         Rocktail (raw + cooked)
Dragon chainbody                     Infinity robes              
Fury                                           Uncut gems        
Dragon leather                           Berserker ring          
Frost dragon bones                    Red chinchompas             
Dragon boots                            Herbs      
Dragonfire shield                      Diamond bolt (e)              
Planks                                       Dragon Hatchet     
Dark bows                                Dragon Pickaxe        
Bandos Tassets                        Regen bracelet         
Bandos Chestplate                  Zamorakian spear         
Godswords                              Ranger boots     
Dragon platelegs                     Adamantite bars                     
                     

  Choosing a item, sell price and buy price

 You can use any of the items from the above list or use your own items. Items can take seconds to buy, or even hours. Generally if an item buys instantly, then your buy price is too high. However, higher priced items such as an Elysian spirit shield, can take a long time to buy and sell but have greater profit per flip. It&#39;s all down to what you can afford and what type of flipping you want to do. Whether it is logging in for a few minutes, to update prices then coming back later or constantly doing fast flips. Here are a few pictures of different types of flips.

Long flips

When buying an item under 1m, you can use a fast method to find rough flip prices of that item. Simply buy 1 of the item at 5% over mid and then sell it at 5% under mid. The lowest price will be your rough buy price and the highest will be your rough sell price as shown in this example

[img]http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/8193/16746354.png[/img]

Always remember to round your prices, so in the example you would round up the buy price to 3,251 and round down the sell price to 3,299 this will speed up your flips :) 

Increasing your limits

You may have noticed in some of my pictures that I am buying and sell items in amounts way over their set 4 hour limit. This is because in my common flipped items I take advantage of the mass flipping method. To do this you need to stock your item, for example, whips. You can leave an offer in yourself overnight (approx 12 hours) and get 30 whips. Now sell all the whips at once on the ge. You will then be able to re-buy 30 whips instantly without being limited to the general 10 per 4 hour limit. Please note that this only lasts for a limited time (under 4 hours) after you have sold all your items. So if you take too long to buy or sell the item, you will lose your limit and have to stock from the start again. 

Good items to do this with include whips, dragon boots, herbs, bones, runes, planks, ores, bars and pure essence. Runes and pure essence are easier to do as you can use multiple f2p accounts to help you stock. Just 5 accounts can be getting you a whopping 750k pure essence / 750k runes in just 24 hours. Having such a high limit on pure essence can make you millions per hour.

Despite this I wouldn&#39;t recommend going over 400k pure essence as you regularly lose your limit.

[b][u]
 Making Glass[/u][/b]



 General Summary: Making glass from buckets of sand and seaweed using the Lunar Magicks spell    Superglass Make.

 Location: Castle Wars Bank

 Skills: Magic (77), Summoning(47)

 Quests: Lunar Diplomacy

 Equipment: Staff of air

 Description:
Conventional glass making is a slow and tedious process, but if you have level 77 Magic and have done Lunar Diplomacy, you have a better option: the Superglass Make spell. When cast, it automatically converts all buckets of sand and seaweed or soda ash in your inventory into glass. Not only is this much faster, but you get bonus glass as well: with 13 buckets of sand and 13 seaweed, you get 13 to 20 glass. The bonus glass makes this a good moneymaker, and as if that wasn&#39;t enough, you also get lots of Magic XP (around 27k per hour) and a good 45k/hr of Crafting XP too! You can&#39;t lose -- as long as you have the requirements.      

 Method: 
The method is easy. Turn on Lunar Magicks, and summon a magpie familiar -- this is just to make extra money from what it forages while you work.

Equip an air staff and go to a single-click bank like the one at Castle Wars. Withdraw from the bank a stack of astral runes and another of fire runes. Then take out 13 buckets of sand and 13 seaweed and cast the spell. Wait until about 3 seconds of the animation has occurred, then click the bank, store the glass and repeat. You can do about 350 casts per hour. Be sure to use the &quot;X&quot; feature to withdraw 13 the first time, so you can use it again from then on to speed up the process.


[u][b] Gathering White Berries[/b][/u]

 

 General Summary: Gathering white berries from the spawn in the middle of the Elven lands of
  Tirannwn, using a war tortoise beast of burden.

 Location: Tirannwn

 Skills: Agility (90), Summoning(67)

 Quests: Mourning&#39;s End, Part I (start)

 Equipment: Boots of lightness, Spottier cape, Penance gloves, Teleport crystals

 Description:
White berries are a high-level Herblore component that are difficult to get in large quantities, and so are always in high demand. With high enough levels and the right technique, you can make money easily by gathering them from a spawn located in the middle of the Elven lands. To do this efficiently, you will need to have at least started Mourning&#39;s End Part I, as well as having a number of Elven teleport crystals, so you don&#39;t have to waste time constantly recharging them.

Make sure you are on a full world for faster respawns.

Method: 
Put on weight reducing gear and a ring of duelling. Take out of the bank a 1-dose or 2-dose regular antipoison potion, 2 salmon or other cheap food, a charged Elven teleport crystal (any number of charges) and a war tortoise pouch. You only need 1 dose of antipoison, but it can be hard to buy 1-dose potions. The cheapest way to go is to take 3 3-dose antipoisons, combine them into a single 1-dose and 2 4-dose potions, then split the 4-doses into a pair of 2-dose pots each.

Click the crystal to teleport to Lleyta, then run northwest and pass through the tree entrance to the town. Go west and over the tripwire -- at this Agility level you should be able to get over it safely most of the time, but if not, don&#39;t worry about that. Go west a bit, then south and jump over the leaf trap. On your minimap you&#39;ll see a red dot just to your west -- that&#39;s the white berries spawn, so click it to run around towards it. You&#39;ll go past another tripwire and can try to cross it safely if you wish, though again that doesn&#39;t matter too much either. Take your antipoison and eat food to heal as needed.

Now start picking up the white berries. They respawn quickly, so it won&#39;t take very long to get a full inventory of them. When you have at least 18 summon the tortoise and store berries within it. Continue until your inventory is full (so you have a total of 45) and then use your ring of duelling to return to Castle Wars. Bank there and then repeat.


[b][u]
 Tanning Black Dragonhides[/u][/b]

 
 General Summary: Tanning black dragonhide in Al-Kharid, running continuously and using a spirit   terrorbird&#39;s Tireless Run scrolls to restore energy.

Location: Al-Kharid

Skills: Agility(90), Summoning(52)

Quests: None

Equipment: Boots of lightness, Spottier cape, Penance gloves

Description:
High-level players use thousands of dragonhides to level Crafting quickly, and are willing to pay a premium to have someone else engage in the boring task of running the hides to the tanner to have them made into dragon leather. The difference in price between hides and leather is not much, but with the right technique you can do thousands per hour, making this a good moneymaker even at very low levels.

The process is identical for all four leather colors. Before you start tanning, check the prices of hides and leathers for all four types at the Grand Exchange; depending on which has the highest spread, you may wish to try tanning green, blue or red dragonhides instead. Also, be patient when buying and selling hides and leather, as sometimes it can take a while for them to sell. Try buying hides for a few coins over the median price and selling leathers for a few coins below average price; don&#39;t buy the hides and max price and sell leathers at min price or you&#39;ll eat up all your profit.

This is one of the few gathering/running techniques where I recommend just having an energy restoring potion or scroll in your inventory at all times -- this costs you an inventory slot, but the weight of the hides and the constant running means you need to restore energy constantly. I also recommend using super energy potions instead of energy potions at lower levels. 

Once you reach level 52 Summoning you can summon a spirit terrorbird. You should only use the bird for its special move to save the cost of energy potions; trying to store hides in it will slow you down.

Method: 
Go to the bank in Al-Kharid and put on your boots of lightness and spotted cape; summon a spirit terrorbird. Take out from the bank around 100k of gold, a stack of 200 or so Tireless Run scrolls and 26 dragonhides. Run north to Ellis, trade him and choose &quot;Tan All&quot; to turn all the hides to leather, then run back to the bank.

Use the terrorbird&#39;s special move when your energy is down by more than half your Agility level (so, down more than 45% at Agility level 90). This only works when the bird is near you, but with practice you&#39;ll learn when to click the special move bar. 


  [b][u] Killing Tortoises [/u][/b]

 
 General Summary: Killing tortoises in the pen in the Gnome Stronghold using a pack yak familiar (level 96 Summoning required.)


Location: Gnome Stronghold

Skills: Attack(96), Strength(96), Defence(96), Summoning(96)

Quests: None

Equipment: Helm of neitiznot, Soul Wars cape, Amulet of glory, Abyssal whip/rapier, Bandos chest / tasset, dragon defender, Gloves {Barrows}, Dragon boots, Berserker ring

Description:
Tortoise are monsters that were almost completely ignored until Jagex finally made a use for tortoise shells as the secondary ingredient in war tortoise Summoning pouches. The usefulness and high cost of war tortoise pouches means that the shells used to make them are likewise valuable. In addition to occasionally dropping 1 to 3 of these shells, tortoises also occasionally give &quot;perfect shells&quot;. These cannot be traded to players, but can be sold to Barlak in Dorgesh-Kaan for 500 gold pieces plus 500 Crafting XP! The tortoises also provide some other minor drops, as well as big bones for each kill. Since they are close to the bank, I recommend saving the big bones to increase your earnings.

Tortoises are also a good source of wergali seeds,

There are two level 79 tortoises in the Grand Tree fighting spot, as well as a level 92 that has three gnomes on it. The tortoises are the same in terms of drops, but the level 92 one has 20 more hitpoints, and you also must deal with the nuisance of the who will attack you after the beast is killed. So try to stick to the level 79s if you can, though if you are high level they take too long to respawn for you to stay busy. Making this worse is that the nice drops of these monsters has made them quite popular recently, and since you need a world to yourself to fight them efficiently, you may have to go onto a relatively empty server. This means you&#39;ll have to fight more of the level 92s, but it&#39;s still better than competing with others for the monsters.

Ironically, I don&#39;t recommend using a war tortoise familiar here because its high cost will cut into your profit margin.      

Be sure to check the prices of the oddball drops you get from these monsters -- some are surprisingly valuable and worth banking.

Method: 
To get to the tortoises, use a ring of duelling to teleport to Al-Kharid and run west to the gnome glider, and take it to the Grand Tree. Bank there, equipping yourself with standard melee gear, and take out a 3-dose super set and a pack yak pouch. You don&#39;t need food because they rarely hit and they drop gnome food fairly regularly. (If you want to bank that food for resale, bring some cheap food of your own.)

Run down and exit the tree, then run northwest to the room north of the swamp. World hop until you find an empty world, trying to get one as full as possible. Start with the level 79 tortoises, then switch to the level 92 -- at this level you will usually have to fight all three monsters.

Use your super sets and collect good drops -- including the big bones -- summoning your pack yak when needed to carry more. Due to its high capacity you can stay for quite a while. When done, return to the bank and then repeat. 


 [b][u]Killing Snakes[/u][/b]

 
General Summary: Killing snakes for their hides on Mos Le&#39; Harmless, using a spirit terrorbird familiar.

Location: Mos Le&#39; Harmless

Skills: Attack(90), Strength(90), Defence(90), Summoning(52)

Quests: Cabin Fever

Equipment: Helm of neitiznot, Soul Wars cape, Amulet of fury, Abyssal whip/rapier, Varrock armour 3, bandos tasset, Gloves {Barrows}, Dragon boots, Berserker ring
Description:
Traditionally, snake hides have been used to make snakeskin armor, used by mid-level players for ranging. This armor has never been very valuable, and so neither were snake skins. Summoning changed everything when it came out, bringing with it an important leveling familiar that uses snake skins as a secondary ingredient. The skins are now quite valuable, due to high demand and the difficulty in getting them. The only practical way to obtain them is on the island of Mos Le&#39; Harmless, and even there, getting them is far from convenient. They are spread out over a wide area and there are aggressive jungle horrors that make attacking just the snakes impossible.

However, there is one place that works well for killing snakes -- near the entrance to the minigame Trouble Brewing. There is a bank deposit box here, and two snakes that respawn just northwest and northeast of it, without jungle horrors. You need to complete the quest Cabin Fever to access Mos Le&#39; Harmless, and I assume that this requires at least mid level skills to do so.

Snakes are mildly poisonous; I use super antipoisons at mid levels (when they hit more frequently) and regular antipoisons at higher levels since they cost less.

Method:
Get to Mos Le&#39; Harmless by right-clicking Bill Teach on his ship in Port Phasmatys, or using the charter ships.

At the bank in Mos Le&#39; Harmless, put on standard melee gear, except use Varrock armour 3 for your body armor and nothing on your legs. At this level you don&#39;t need full armor when fighting these critters, and the extra weight just slows you down.

You also don&#39;t really need healing food or run energy restoration, so summon a magpie for its extra foraging, and take several regular antipoison potions, and a few extra magpie pouches, depending on how long you want to stay. Exit the bank and go out of town to the north. Run east for quite a ways, through the jungle horrors, then veer northeast around the Trouble Brewing area until you see the red star that marks the entrance to the minigame.

Start fighting; at this level you should be able to kill the snakes very fast, so your limiting factor may well be respawn speed. 

Periodically put the snake skins you collect into the deposit box. Return to the bank when you need more supplies, adjusting what you take with based on what you ran out of first.



  [u][b]Charging Fire Orbs[/b][/u]

 
 General Summary: Charging fire orbs at the fire obelisk using a pack yak beast of burden to reduce banking/running time. This requires level 96 Summoning.


Location: Fire Obelisk - Taverley Dungeon

Skills: Magic(63), Summoning(96), Agility(95)

Equipment: Staff of fire, Boots of lightness, Spottier cape, Penance gloves, Saradomin mitre, Saradomin stole, Monk&#39;s robe {top}, Monk&#39;s robe {bottom}, Anti-dragon shield

Description:
Fire orbs are used to make fire battlestaves and give very fast Crafting XP, so the orbs are always in high demand. They are made by taking them to the fire obelisk located in the farthest reaches of Taverley Dungeon. The spell requires level 56 Magic and uses 3 cosmic runes and 30 fire runes per orb (the fire staff negates the need for the fire runes, however.)

This method provides decent income and significant amounts of Magic XP: 35k to 42k per hour. Be sure to compare the benefits of doing water, earth or air orbs instead, based on current prices.

At very high levels you can use the level 80 Agility shortcut in the dungeon that cuts about 30 seconds off each run, allowing you to make more orbs per hour. And at level 96 Summoning, the pack yak lets you make several dozen more orbs per hour.

Method: 
Equip a fire staff (or other staff that provides fire runes), weight-reducing equipment, monk&#39;s robes, anti-dragon shield and any god mitre and stole. The prayer items help you get past some dangerous critters that lie in your path to the obelisk.

Starting at Falador west bank, summon a war tortoise. Take out of the bank stacks of Falador teleport tablets and cosmic runes and 26 unpowered orbs. Store these orbs in the yak, then take out 26 more orbs. Note that if you are combat level 128 or below you should also take a dose of super antipoison; at 129 or higher you do not need it.

Run southwest to the crumbling wall shortcut and go over it, then run northwest to the entrance to Taverley Dungeon. Go north to the spiked blade shortcut and cross it, then run west past the poison spiders. Put on Protection from Melee, then run northwest past the black dragons, continuing until you see the fire obelisk. Turn off prayer.

Cast the Charge Fire Orb spell on the obelisk, then choose to make all the orbs. When done, open the pack yak and swap the 26 charged orbs for unpowered ones, 4 at a time. Then charge these 26 orbs. When done, click your Falador teletab and return to the bank. Store the charged fire orbs, take out an energy potion and restore energy to full. Then repeat the process.

A trip takes about 5 minutes and 30 seconds, so you can get 11 trips per hour for a total of 572 orbs.</description>

              <p>[quote=“DevilsCape, post:4, topic:403828”]Well, thanks much i read all of them!, id like to do the flipping one the most,and i might do tortoise one for the crafting Xp,maybe snakes or hides, ill make sure to try all of them xD</p>
<hr>
<p>Questions : … i have 10mill , what do you think i can flip</p>
<p>Question2: whats better for money snakes or tanning hides, by the way im 126 cmb with 97 str and 90 def atk and 94 Hp and 77 summon, so that you know my levels in order to predict my money rate at snakes method.</p>
<hr>
<p>Please answer my questions :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Hey, the cheaper items that i listed near the top of my first post would be good for you to flip,</p>
<p>At your combat, providing you have 70 agility and 60 dungeoneering, blue dragons in taverly dungeon would be around 400k - 600k per hour, i would recommend using a foreign server as there is loads of bots on English servers <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
