    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-to-do-list-need-major-help/324762</link>
    <description>1. make npc&#39;s fight back. (KQ already fights back no mater what so how do i make everything fight back like KQ. some npcs will hit you once the first time but them it will stop till it dies or u use a spec)
2. For some reasion there is only 2 staff icons. Mod and Admin. player rights 1 = mod, 2 = admin icon, 3 (owner) = admin icon. (why is this and how do i fix this!)
3. how to make it so only (x) amount of people can log in at 1 time. example if 50 players are online and player 51 tries to log in it will say &quot;server is full please try again in 1 minute&quot;
4. when you use spec on some weapons like dragon claws, godswords they hit 300&#39;s in pk. how do i change this?
5. how to make it so if you die killing npc you dont loose all stuff?
6. how to fix thieving timer. it takes 15 sec every steal!
7. if you have a full spec bar and you use ags spec it takes all spec away but if you have half spec and use ags spec it still works. how do i make it so if u have full spec it only takes half of spec bar?

~~ I CAN CONNECT THROUGH TEAMVIEWER IF THAT WILL HELP ~~

Thanks!
