    <description>Hey guys, I am back :P I haven&#39;t actually programmed anything within the last good 2-3 years I have been away I am currently looking for a server sided programmer and also a client sided programmer. I am very professional and would expect the best of your abilities I am not asking for someone to join that is a wizard at programming because I am fare from that my self but what I am looking for is someone who knows what they are doing can get on with the job with out distraction and can produce good ideas and good content too.

anyway this base will be a Pi I have already got a base I want to use  the server has some features already but not that many I am looking to improve the server completely and once it is completed or up to my standards I would like to invest into a vps and start hosing it. 

some of my previous work I have done

You must also be friendly, good to get along with, dedicated, and MUST ENJOY DOING THIS because if you join my development team couple weeks down the line I don&#39;t want to have to advertise again for a new developer due to people quitting because they don&#39;t enjoy the project anymore

[size=10pt][code]What are you applying for server sided or client sided ? - 
how long have you been programming for ? also what would you rate your skills out of 10? -
if you decided to join the team would I be able to trust you? -
how many hours a day would you put into the server ? -
are you creative? and do you look for unique content to add into a server or do you just copy what everyone else has? -
