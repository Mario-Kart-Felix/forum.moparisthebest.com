Well that and he has no physical way of “slashing” at the moment.</p>

              <p>Children, this is why is why i stopped coming to the model section. Childish flaming and such over nothing. Human bodies are not easy to model, let alone get the anatomy of. Sure, you are a living human, but you don’t understand the actual complexity there is, of you just being able to walk. Even a part inside of your ear plays a role in your balance. Without that, you wouldn’t know up from down.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@MODEL</span> - Its not bad for a RSPS NPC. You still wouldn’t see all of that detail, but it is nice. I would suggest making a elbow though, or at least cutting the arm at one point, to make something like an elbow for animating.</p>

OH MY GOD. I’m sooooo sorry I offered criticism. I’m soooooo sorry I offered it to make you better at modeling, but I guess I’m not allowed to make people better. I guess you have to be braindead and not take it? I’m sooooo sorry that you can’t take criticism, which is fucking necessary if you want to be better. And I’m sooooo sorry that you don’t understand that since it looks almost identical to a human, it should have similar anatomy. You don’t see monkeys or any creature with awful bone structure like that. Or maybe you don’t fucking DESERVE the criticism because you’re too god damn immature to take it?<br>

Monster or not, a bone structure like that would kill you right away.  Without a breastbone your ribs won’t have anything to support them and they will get crushed extremely easy.  A kneecap being a ring isn’t going to support a hinge joint movement, as the leg won’t stop in the ring.  Don’t you think before you try to get all defensive?  The skeleton anatomy is horrible monster or not.<br>

You need to work on your skeleton anatomy more.</p>
<p>There’s no pelvis, just a curved block, there should be two bones in the forearm (you have one) and lower leg (you…have 3…what), and there is only one bone in the femur, there is no breastbone, the ribs just abruptly end, the ribcage goes on too far for the lumbar vertebrae to start, and the kneecap is a ring, and uh, he seems to have monkey hands for feet.<br>

Monster or not, a bone structure like that would kill you right away.  Without a breastbone your ribs won’t have anything to support them and they will get crushed extremely easy.  A kneecap being a ring isn’t going to support a hinge joint movement, as the leg won’t stop in the ring.  Don’t you think before you try to get all defensive?  The skeleton anatomy is horrible monster or not.</p>
