    <title>Soo retarted, someone with a brain answer this</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/soo-retarted-someone-with-a-brain-answer-this/147903</link>
    <description>How come this section is full of the same questions over and over?
Silab crap, runserver, compiling, port forwarding, no-ip, getting server to work, global objects, all crap that has a gillion tuts on it. And, when someone posts a question that you need you brain to answer, it doesn&#39;t get viewed, and doesn&#39;t get replied to!
It&#39;s ridiculous, people come here for help, but only the noobs with the repeated questions get answers.</description>
