    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-unpack-this/227685</link>
    <description>its a chinese bot for runescape i think

http://rapidshare.com/files/139416227/unpackme.zip

it doesnt start anymore cuz he shut it down.. but i think if someone could unpack it or atleast tell me which tools i need to unpack it.. i tried PeID on it it says unknown packer its some chinese packer.. dunno but i wanna look at it unpacked

i got the exp to make my own bots and such. with __declspec(naked) functions.. even though i make a bot.. i dont understand the decrypted packets at all.. only ones i understand is like chat.. cuz its in ascii table letters.. on some games not runescape of course but other games.. but yah i cant make bots cuz i dun understand packets.. so i wanna see how this bot works under the hood.

i got no exp unpacking programs no clue at all..</description>
