    <description>alright, i was trying to add the admin crowns next to the names in the moonspell client. ive got #adm# working and ive added [code]		if (status == 3)
			message = &quot;#adm#&quot; + message;[/code]
after compiling and logging in, nothing works.

im sure its something reallllyyyy simple, like always, i seem to forget most of the simple things lmao.

EDIT: nvm i got it working, moonspell has weird ranks O.o it was obvious btw..</description>
