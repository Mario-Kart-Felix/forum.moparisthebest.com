    <title>Lots of people who died</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lots-of-people-who-died/7028</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Teddy sniffing glue he was 12 years old
Fell from the roof on East Two-nine
Cathy was 11 when she pulled the plug
On 26 reds and a bottle of wine
Bobby got leukemia, 14 years old
He looked like 65 when he died
He was a friend of mine

Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
Those are people who died, died
They were all my friends, and they died

G-berg and Georgie let their gimmicks go rotten
So they died of hepatitis in upper Manhattan
Sly in Vietnam took a bullet in the head
Bobby OD&#39;d on Drano on the night that he was wed
They were two more friends of mine
Two more friends that died / I miss &#39;em--they died

Mary took a dry dive from a hotel room
Bobby hung himself from a cell in the tombs
Judy jumped in front of a subway train
Eddie got slit in the jugular vein
And Eddie, I miss you more than all the others,
And I salute you brother/ This song is for you my brother


Herbie pushed Tony from the Boys&#39; Club roof
Tony thought that his rage was just some goof
But Herbie sure gave Tony some bitchen proof
&quot;Hey,&quot; Herbie said, &quot;Tony, can you fly?&quot;
But Tony couldn&#39;t fly . . . Tony died


Brian got busted on a narco rap
He beat the rap by rattin&#39; on some bikers
He said, hey, I know it&#39;s dangerous,
but it sure beats Riker&#39;s
But the next day he got offed
by the very same bikers&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

He was a friend of mine
<p>Those are people who died, died<br>
Those are people who died, died<br>
Those are people who died, died<br>
Those are people who died, died<br>
They were all my friends, and they died</p>
<p>G-berg and Georgie let their gimmicks go rotten<br>
So they died of hepatitis in upper Manhattan<br>
Sly in Vietnam took a bullet in the head<br>
Bobby OD’d on Drano on the night that he was wed<br>
They were two more friends of mine<br>
Two more friends that died / I miss 'em–they died</p>
<p>Mary took a dry dive from a hotel room<br>
Bobby hung himself from a cell in the tombs<br>
Judy jumped in front of a subway train<br>
Eddie got slit in the jugular vein<br>
And Eddie, I miss you more than all the others,<br>
And I salute you brother/ This song is for you my brother</p>
<p>Herbie pushed Tony from the Boys’ Club roof<br>
Tony thought that his rage was just some goof<br>
But Herbie sure gave Tony some bitchen proof<br>
“Hey,” Herbie said, “Tony, can you fly?”<br>
But Tony couldn’t fly . . . Tony died</p>
<p>Brian got busted on a narco rap<br>
He beat the rap by rattin’ on some bikers<br>
He said, hey, I know it’s dangerous,<br>
but it sure beats Riker’s<br>
But the next day he got offed<br>
by the very same bikers</p>
