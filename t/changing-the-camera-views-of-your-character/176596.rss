    <title>Changing the camera views of your character?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-camera-views-of-your-character/176596</link>
    <description>Is it possible to change the camera views of you character?

If so how would i change them?

At the moment you can only make the camera view your character at a max hieght of 50 degrees, And a minimum hieght of 20 degrees (this is shown by the red lines on the picture below).

I want to be able to change the camera views to a max of 90 degrees and a minum of 0 degrees (this is hown by the black lines on the picture above). 

This would mean i could see my character from the top and eye height.</description>
