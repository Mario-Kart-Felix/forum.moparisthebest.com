    <description>[b]How To Use Variables, and Contants - By Hey321:[/b]

[b]How To Use A Variable:[/b]

A Variable is something you could use as a failsafe, or for a progress report. You declare one by saying What it&#39;s called, (I&#39;ll use Example) and What the variable type is. Types i know of are String; Boolean; Integer; LongInt;( i believe), post if you know anymore. This is how you declare one:


[code]
Program New;

Var// Tells Scar it&#39;s a Variable
 Example: Integer; // Colon MUST be there, or you get errors, also, the semicolon must be to

Begin
End.
[/code]

That tells Scar the it&#39;s a Variable, and that it&#39;s called Example, and that Example is an integer (Positive or Negative number).

[code]
Program New;

Var// Tells Scar it&#39;s a Variable
 Example: Integer; // Colon MUST be there, or you get errors, also, the semicolon must be to

Begin
Example:=Example+1 //Tells Scar that Example has just gone up one
WriteIn(IntToStr(Example)) // Tells Scar to Write In Example as a String, and it was an Integer, which is why IntToStr is there
End.[/code]

That tells Scar the Example is now Example + 1, or 0 + 1, 1 + 1 and so on. Then it tells Scar to Write In that as a String into the debug box. It&#39;s an Integer so that&#39;s why IntToStr (Integer To String) is there, to turn it into a string.
[b]
How To Use A Constant:[/b]

A Constant is a number THAT WILL NOT CHANGE! You are NOT able to change it without restarting the script. You declare on by saying what it&#39;s called, and what it&#39;s equal to.

First, we make a const:

[code]
Program New;

Var// Tells Scar it&#39;s a Variable
 Example: Integer; // Colon MUST be there, or you get errors, also, the semicolon must be to

Const // Tells Scar it&#39;s a Constant
 EndAt=10;

Begin
Example:=Example+1 //Tells Scar that Example has just gone up one
WriteIn(IntToStr(Example)) // Tells Scar to Write In Example as a String, and it was an Integer, which is why IntToStr is there
End.[/code]

Const tells Scar it&#39;s a Constant, and EndAt is our constant. Now, to put it to use:

[code]
Program New;

Var// Tells Scar it&#39;s a Variable
 Example: Integer; // Colon MUST be there, or you get errors, also, the semicolon must be to

Const // Tells Scar it&#39;s a Constant
 EndAt=10;

Begin
Repeat// Tells Scar to repeat it (Duh?)
Example:=Example+1 //Tells Scar that Example has just gone up one
WriteIn(IntToStr(Example)) // Tells Scar to Write In Example as a String, and it was an Integer, which is why IntToStr is there
Until(Example=EndAt)// Repeats the before code until Example is equal to EndAt
End[/code]

Now, i just told Scar to Repeat the Example:Example+1 and WriteLn stuff until Example is equal to EndAt, or 10 because that&#39;s what EndAt is.

[b]That&#39;s all for now![/b]</description>
