              <p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:1, topic:307240”]As you said in one of your posts, people aren’t stupid and they’ll see this blatant fake attempt at being nice. Lets say for example you do win people over and have a successful server with 50+ online most of the time, you’ll then get a big head like before and introduce donations again. It’s history repeating itself.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>For example, look at Luke, Kryptix. Good kid, but he hates me. Don’t blame him though… But he does a very good job at what he does.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Take a look at this quote. You switch things round and make it look like you like me, but I hate you. I must admit, you’re almost convincing. You forget to mention that you IP banned me and deleted all my characters that I (legit) trained for 2 months. You forget to mention that you deleted Adx1’s forum accounts (as well as his several 99hp characters) for simply posting some constructive criticism. You forget to mention that you deleted Nicholas’ and Ztooner’s forum accounts (as well as their characters) for being on RSCEmulation. All of these decisions are RECENT, AFTER you promised everyone that you were going to change.</p>
<p>You forget Matt, I trusted you, I invested hours, days, weeks into your server and pretty much everything I’ve done to RSCEmulation, I offered to do for you. Pretty much every suggestion I’ve implemented (or had implemented) was suggested on Project P2P but you chose to ignore it. I’m not even gunna lie, RSCEmulation only grew as fast as it did because you messed up. You lost everyone’s trust and now a LOT of your players are now RSCEmulation players. They’ve now invested a lot of time into RSCEmulation and I doubt they’ll ‘switch’ easily, unless of course we mess up as badly as you did, but I highly doubt that because we care for our community, listen to suggests and generally treat players with the respect they deserve. We make absolutely no profit at RSCEmulation (our choice), and we still give them respect. Your players were putting food on your table every-single-day and you still treated them like scum.</p>
<p>Believe me, I’d post it on the Project P2P forums but I’d just get IP banned and told to ‘fuck off faggot :]’ so there’s really not a lot of point.</p>
<p>I wish you the best of luck with it, but I really can’t see it going anywhere. Before RSCEmulation and RSCDevil came around people didn’t really have much choice if they wanted a fast XP rate server, whilst still staying semi-original (not a dedicated PK/stake server), but now RSCEmulation has launched as well as RSCDevil so people actually have a choice.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to talk and genuinely want to hear my view, unblock me on MSN and we’ll have a chat.[/quote]</p>
<p>very true facts about matt</p>
