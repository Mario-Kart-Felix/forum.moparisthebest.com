    <title>Making a Total Level Thing? It&#39;s not a command, idk just look</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-total-level-thing-its-not-a-command-idk-just-look/285268</link>
    <description>On most servers when you get a 99 in a skill you get a skillcape. I want to make it so that when you get 99 in every skill you get some items too. 99 in every skill would be a total level of 2277. I think I have totalz decalred for Total Level, if anyone knows how I can check that though could you show me? This is what I have so far, is this the right format I should be doing? Thanks.

[code=cpp]        case 21: // Totallevel
            // sendFrame164(4261);
            // sendFrame126(&quot;Congratulations, you&#39;ve done it!&quot;, 6207);
            // sendFrame126(&quot;Your total level is now 2277!&quot;, 6208);
            sendMessage(&quot;Congratulations, you have just acheived the highest total level possible!&quot;);
            // NpcDialogueSend = true;
            if (totalz &gt;= 2277) {
                addItem(989, 1);
                sendMessage(
                        &quot;Congratulations, you reicive some awsome items.&quot;);
                PlayerHandler.messageToAll = (playerName + &quot; has just gotten &quot;
                        + playerLevel[1] + &quot; in everything!&quot;);
            }
            break;
        }
    }[/code]</description>

<p>I know, you posted this before… I just need to know where to paste it. Can you tell me something to search for so I can paste this under it. Also, do you know how I can declare totalz as Total Level? [br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 24, 2009, 05:41:21 pm[/size][hr]Rich your so useless. Why do you think I made another topic asking about this total level thing. I didn’t get an answer to it! So why should it be any different if you just copy and pasted the same answer I got last time. I needed more information then and I still do now, where do I paste this? I’m placing it in these differnt sections and it isn’t working. Can you answer a simple question like that?</p>
