[u][b]IntroDuction[/b][/u]

RuneKeep was made because I got tired of the old 317 loading 634 and shit. The Boring 5 minute cache and I couldnt delete the cache to make it shorter I was way to lazy for that.
And well I love Oldschool Graphics :) 

In RuneKeep you will be using your skills to get to alot of places. Such as Agility and combat skills etc etc..
The levelin is decent not to fast ;S becuase players get bored once there maxed unless your server has over 50+ at once. 

I will be trying to get alot of the skills working then eventually Hunter. I havent gotten to that and I will be soon. I just finished agility and fishing :P 
With the agility there is a new course that I am making its at [b]45%[/b].

[i][u][b]Choose your God[/b][/u][/i]


Choosing your god. At a certain skill level you will be able to open the doors at the RuneKeeps castle in Varrock City. Once you enter you will be in the cave of Gods.

[u][i]You can pick any of the 3 gods[/i][/u].

[b]Zamorok[/b] - The powerful strong god with powerful Blows!

[b]Guthix[/b] - The Protection God. Block Powerful hits and ofcourse some strength ++

[b]Saradomin[/b] - The God of Wisdom, you have a strong magic bonus and Range.

The Idea is still in developement, I would like RuneKeep to evolve on just that. So it would be a big part of RuneKeep atm its pretty basic but so are my coding skills..

I will be tweakin the stats of the capes. Here are my Ideas.

 Zamorok Is made for BIG hits but depeneding on your other gear you will have low defence.
I want to add a crit chance to the cape :P would be epic.

Guthix is made for Blockin the Big hits from zamorak :) But low strength but with some good gear you could maybe get some good strength and bbe completely L33t.

Saradomin is all about Mage and Range what can I say pretty sweet :) Has alot of Prayer and little defence.

So you should be wearing a cape at all times :S while PVP or PVE if you want to be any good ofcourse. SkillCapes will be able to operate and make your skill higher for about 20 minutes but like 5%. 


[u][b]UPDATE LOG[/b][/u]

1. Fixed WC Bug - You would keep woodcutting after the tree was down.
2. Agility Course - A bit more added!

[u][i][b]PVP - Player Vs. Player[/b][/i][/u]


PVP is all over RuneKeep because the world has been corrupted ever since some mystic power and RuneKeep AKA Varrock is the last place not to be corrupted. Once you log in you will get the story line.

Although there are some cool features to this. You can travel with some friends and find NPCs all over RuneKeep talk to them and you may get some reward or experience.

The Combat is Fresh as can be. No I am not saying I tweaked it cause I didnt :P 
It was already beast when I got the source rofl :) 

[u][i][b]Skilling[/b][/i][/u]

Im Currently workin on the main non-CB stats to all work.
Hunter will be hard but im working on it Via Tuts.

Hunter - 10% :) 

Theere is a new skilling zone made by me there is more organized and sexii.
Video - Coming Soon.

Skilling will be the same old skilling all working but your skills will be used later on as you get better in RuneKeep.

[u][i][b]Videos / media[/b][/i][/u]

[u][b]ADDING ALOT MORE MEDIA LATER[/b][/u]


Combat 90% -

Agility Course 45% -

Choose Your God 84% - [url=http://tinypic.com/r/259zif9/7]The Godly Video[/url]
