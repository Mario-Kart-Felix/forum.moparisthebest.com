    <title>Your Design Preference</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/your-design-preference/541074</link>
    <description>Which layout would you rather for a website which you put a picture of you on and people like your picture like Tindr but on my next post you will find out exactly what it is. Ok.. there is an [b]image at the bottom[/b] where you can have a look at what I mean if you don&#39;t get it &lt;3

First Design: It&#39;s based around Tumblr where you scroll down and look at different pictures in single file, Google plus is another example of this but personally I think Tumblr looks better.

Second Design: It&#39;s based around Instagram where you have 4 pictures in a row. I personally don&#39;t think this would be too great because we want as much attention on the specific person so if four people were in a line it would be hard for the mut lul jk but you know what I mean each person wants the specific attention.

Third Design: This will be some kind of custom design at the moment I was thinking something like there&#39;s a main image in the middle of your screen you can click your arrow keys Left = Go back Right = Next Picture Mouse scroller takes you to the next image depending on the way you  swipe it. I guess you could say this design is like Tinder. Kind of like a parallax scolling

Please tell me what you guys think personally I think a lot could be done with the Third Design. But I think the first one has potential I want to hear your guys opinions and if you have any other ideas that would be fab &lt;3 I am trying to be as unique as possible but as simple as possible :O

              <p>[quote=“xx matty xx, post:4, topic:541074”]I like websites that use the first and third designs. Sites that use the table layout (2nd design) for images piss me off because I have to keep scanning left to right and always miss stuff. I guess the only reason it’s done is to fill horizontal whitespace, but I’d seriously consider finding some other way of filling it.</p>
<p>I think the first design is better for stuff that’s inherently ordered and the third is better for arbitrary collections. For example, if I’m looking at date-ordered photos I’d like to scroll down the page, but if I’m viewing a photo album I’d like to flick through horizontally.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, I was thinking that the third design isn’t simple either. So I will probably go with the first design.</p>
