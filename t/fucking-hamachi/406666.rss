    <title>Fucking hamachi</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fucking-hamachi/406666</link>
    <description>My friend asked me to install hamachi, so I did. But after restarting a few days later, I found that I can no longer connect to my wireless! It has a wpa2 encryption, and whenever I try to connect windows tells me it either can&#39;t authenticate or it can&#39;t connect. However, it can still connect to the (encrypted) hotspot I&#39;m creating from my phone. This really sucks because I want to use my home wifi, what can I do? Google hasn&#39;t helped out here.
EDIT:
That was annoying, fixed it though. Turned out the router had been malfunctioning... I&#39;ve run into this problem with hamachi before though, luckily it wasn&#39;t happening now.</description>

              <p>Unfortunately can’t disable the encryption. Landlord doesn’t want that. Also, the encryption seems to work fine from my phones hotspot. I could probably mess around with the router if he doesn’t realize though.</p>
