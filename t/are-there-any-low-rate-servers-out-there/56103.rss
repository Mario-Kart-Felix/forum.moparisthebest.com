    <title>Are there any Low Rate Servers out there</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/are-there-any-low-rate-servers-out-there/56103</link>
    <description>Like... Maybe a server that is lower than average, and has actual monsters to kill rather than those damned Dummies/hay stacks/doors...

I actually made my own server so you get 10 experience per damage you inflict and you can only train on monsters. (In my own training zone I made with enemies from level 5 goblins to Lesser Demons...)
But, I am too lazy to host a server and deal with crap. So if anyone could possibly post a server like the one I described in the first sentence, that would be great, thanks.</description>
