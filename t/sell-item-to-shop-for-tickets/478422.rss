    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sell-item-to-shop-for-tickets/478422</link>
    <description>Hey I created a shop were you can buy items for tickets and it works fine, but when I sell the item back is sells it back for coins. So basically is the item in the shop costs 50 tickets, you can but it for thoses 50 tickets but if you sell it back you get 50 coins instead of 50 tickets. How can I change it so you get tickets back??</description>

<p>You didn’t need to create a new Thread for this. You do it in the same fashion in which you solved the Buying ‘problem’ you had earlier. I thought that we didn’t help you though? You probably followed a Tutorial (I thought you said there wasn’t a single one on the whole wide Interwebs), so I recommend you use that same Tutorial as a Base for this as well.</p>
