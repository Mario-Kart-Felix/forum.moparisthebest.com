[center][b]Quick information:[/b][/center]

XP rate: Around x6
Server: Staminus

[center][b]Our concept:[/b][/center]


- The main idea is to make a server that is fun to play, with an active wilderness where taking risks will pay off, a server which has reachable goals of max stats and obtaining good items, without damaging the economy and value of obtaining high end items such as Rune.


- The xp rates will be x2, and x2.5 for subs, with an additional 0.2 in wilderness. Later on we will add even more additional xp in wild, the deeper you go - the more xp you get. I know alot of people get scared away by &quot;lower xp rates&quot;, but the problem isn&#39;t really the lower rates, the problem is that private servers have lead you to believe that you NEED 99 in every stat when in actual fact you don&#39;t, people seem to have forgotten the good old RSC days when you would go PK at RR even if you were just 82hp, you would gather a team and just go out and PK and have fun. Fact is you can play the game without having to be 99 in every stat.


- To motivate players to go to wilderness we have put the best training spots, rune rocks spot, farming spots, etc, in wild. You will also find a few surprises in this new landscape, but it&#39;s all up to you to explore.


- We believe a good staff is perhaps the most vital part of a servers success. We will pick our staff team very carefully, and if any mod misbehaves the slightest - we won&#39;t hesitate to take action.


- We intend to maintain and update the game frequently following the guidance of the community, without introducing features which are unwanted. 
 

- Upon launch we will currently have three custom areas, being:

- A whole new wilderness: A new wilderness area for players to explore and train at.
- A subscribers island: An area for those who choose to subscribe to train at.
- A new main town: A centralized area for players to shop, bank and leap into action.

The idea is to ensure players have something to do upon reaching high end stats, adding incentives such as the best spots in the game for skill and combat based training.

We&#39;d like to thank all our players for sticking with us in the beginning even tho there has been a rough start with a lot of bugs to be fixed. We&#39;re constantly working to update and improve the server in the direction that you players want. 


Thanks, if you have any questions about the server don&#39;t hesitate to ask and I will answer in the best way I can.

Have a great day,

Linus

<p>And Nothing-, why are you so concerned about this server? Why don’t you worry about your own fail server instead of bad mouthing every other server that comes out. You and Crooks put up a new shitty server every few months collect sub money and shut it down. You fail at being an admin, now come say “oh you just throw conspiracy theories out there” when it’s all true you ignorant prick.</p>
<p>Oh noes 6-10 people quit, the servers a week old and it’s doing pretty well, how about people give it a shot before sitting here bad mouthing following fran ta noob and nothing LOL.</p>

              <p>Server was ruined. I agree with everything fran has said above.</p>
<p>You guys were allowing botters on your server because you thought it got your playerbase up but made more of us quit. I logged in yesterday to 25 online, 11 x level 3’s were mining in city and mining guild, rest were afk-botting. Economy was ruined, Xp rate should not have been raised, NPC drops should have been implemented upon release of the server not days later, admins shouldnt have been pking on other peoples accounts (especially when server first started).</p>
<p>The only thing you can do to make your server last longterm imo is to take the server down for a week or two, clear the database and implement bug fixes/make few changes before you come back stronger and better.</p>
<p>Even after that I dont know if the 6-10 of us that quit will play again.</p>

<p>funny how i got hacked and then u give my acct to the kid who hacked me after i bought a sub card for the acct then u unbann him saying we need players good job guys gj and then the acct we all smithed on u give him the acct as well we all knew the pass to forum and it should be banned till the real owners ip is on it recovering it but instead u give hacker all are accts no problem</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m not sure on your situation but I can state four things straight off the bat.</p>
<ol>
<li>No one has been banned yet, we are only now about to start.</li>
<li>No one has received any other players account (again this is all within the database only I have control of).</li>
<li>No one has been unbanned (Sort of obvious since no one has been banned).</li>
<li>No forum accounts have been transfered, or passwords given out.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know for a fact by these four points that your story isn’t adding up. If you’re account sharing in game it comes at a extreme risk, I think you need to re-assess the situation.</p>
<p>I apologize for any inconveniences you may have received while playing the game, I can however guarentee that none of them have been caused by what you have stated.<br>
[/quote]<br>
funny how ur always right and im not u never see me on here bad mouthing another server the facts are</p>
<ol>
<li>sum1 gave me acct away i never told my pass the acct was created under my ip</li>
<li>the kid still plays and linus did bann him then u unbanned him<br>
3.ur server has 10 ppl on my team made that server actully have pking till u decided to not help   none of us get are acct back u act like u have 1k players u cant help ppl who started playing from day 1 and subscribed i suggest no1 play this</li>
</ol>
<p>edit= see u dont even no all the facts and u completly disregard everything i said and then when u find out linus did say that u try to play it off[/quote]</p>
<p>This is getting out of hand, to clarify once more:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No in game characters have been banned or unbanned. (The command doesn’t work in game, only I have database access, this is fact.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No in game account passwords have been given away, changed or tampered with in any form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linus does not have the ability to ban in game accounts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On your note on me acting as if I have 1k players on, whether there’s 1 or 100 players online I’ll act the same. I’m not involved with the in-game politics, I have no beef or quarrels with anyone or any players, and I never intend to. I’m not emotionally involved at all, anyone who plays this game I’m thankful too whether they call me a prick or think what we’re doing is good.</p>
<p>Once again, I can promise you:</p>
<p>[b]</p>
<ol>
<li>No in game accounts have been banned.</li>
<li>No in game passwords have been changed.</li>
<li>No in game accounts have been unbanned.</li>
<li>Linus and no other admin can ban except me.<br>
[/b]</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve had issues with our server I sincerely apologize, the only way an in-game account will have been compromized is not from our fault. I can assist in the recovery of any account, but only do the registered email address.</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>

<p>What’s your ingame name again?</p>
<p>To begin with we haven’t even banned anyone on the server, so unbanning someone saying we need players doesn’t make any sense. But just to make this clear, sharing is against our rules, and completely at your own risk. This one guy got hacked, and I did give him his password back since his IP was the same IP as the one who created the account, meaning that it’s his account. From now on we won’t even be giving back passwords to anyone who is hacked tho, all password recoveries will have to go through email. Just to avoid situations like these.</p>

<p>I find it funny you say we set stats or help with items, those commands doesn’t even exists. And before this you all RQ’ed cause you saw one of us hit a 26, then later you changed your story to one of us hitting a 29. Yes I admit I pk’d on an friends account, cause I thought the server needs pking, didn’t think it would be much of a problem but obviously it is, so I won’t do it again.</p>
<p>On to the subject, you will see some more updates shortly, we haven’t been able to code any updates last 2 days due to various reasons, but should be able to now.</p>

<p>I’m not sure on your situation but I can state four things straight off the bat.</p>
<ol>
<li>No one has been banned yet, we are only now about to start.</li>
<li>No one has received any other players account (again this is all within the database only I have control of).</li>
<li>No one has been unbanned (Sort of obvious since no one has been banned).</li>
<li>No forum accounts have been transfered, or passwords given out.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know for a fact by these four points that your story isn’t adding up. If you’re account sharing in game it comes at a extreme risk, I think you need to re-assess the situation.</p>
<p>I apologize for any inconveniences you may have received while playing the game, I can however guarentee that none of them have been caused by what you have stated.[/quote]<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Edit:</span> I just spoke to Linus and apparently he did give a forum account back to someone, I’m not sure if this is to do with your case. <span class="bbcode-b">HOWEVER</span> there is no way to change an in-game accounts password currently so your in game account could not have been changed at all. It can only be done through the database. Linus should not have changed any forum passwords however as players are supposed to recover them to their emails themselves, and he has learned from that. With that said, that also means that any registered user may also recover their forum account back immediately.</p>
<p>So to clarify, no in game accounts have been changed at all and forum accounts can be instantly recovered.</p>
