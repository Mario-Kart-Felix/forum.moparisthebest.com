<p>I find it funny you say we set stats or help with items, those commands doesn’t even exists. And before this you all RQ’ed cause you saw one of us hit a 26, then later you changed your story to one of us hitting a 29. Yes I admit I pk’d on an friends account, cause I thought the server needs pking, didn’t think it would be much of a problem but obviously it is, so I won’t do it again.</p>

        <p>Well I’ll upload highscores today and that’ll settle the fact that there’s no abuse on stats at least. This is also the only person who’s claiming there’s abuse, obviously I can only guarentee there isn’t from my own knowledge of the situation, whether you choose to believe it or not it’s up to you.</p>

The most online was around 40-45, I have to question why are you so cynical about the server?</p>

<p>I’m not sure on your situation but I can state four things straight off the bat.</p>
<ol>
<li>No one has been banned yet, we are only now about to start.</li>
<li>No one has received any other players account (again this is all within the database only I have control of).</li>
<li>No one has been unbanned (Sort of obvious since no one has been banned).</li>
<li>No forum accounts have been transfered, or passwords given out.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know for a fact by these four points that your story isn’t adding up. If you’re account sharing in game it comes at a extreme risk, I think you need to re-assess the situation.</p>
<p>I apologize for any inconveniences you may have received while playing the game, I can however guarentee that none of them have been caused by what you have stated.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Edit:</span> I just spoke to Linus and apparently he did give a forum account back to someone, I’m not sure if this is to do with your case. <span class="bbcode-b">HOWEVER</span> there is no way to change an in-game accounts password currently so your in game account could not have been changed at all. It can only be done through the database. Linus should not have changed any forum passwords however as players are supposed to recover them to their emails themselves, and he has learned from that. With that said, that also means that any registered user may also recover their forum account back immediately.</p>
<p>So to clarify, no in game accounts have been changed at all and forum accounts can be instantly recovered.</p>

<p>What’s your ingame name again?</p>
<p>To begin with we haven’t even banned anyone on the server, so unbanning someone saying we need players doesn’t make any sense. But just to make this clear, sharing is against our rules, and completely at your own risk. This one guy got hacked, and I did give him his password back since his IP was the same IP as the one who created the account, meaning that it’s his account. From now on we won’t even be giving back passwords to anyone who is hacked tho, all password recoveries will have to go through email. Just to avoid situations like these.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>No in game characters have been banned or unbanned. (The command doesn’t work in game, only I have database access, this is fact.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No in game account passwords have been given away, changed or tampered with in any form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linus does not have the ability to ban in game accounts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On your note on me acting as if I have 1k players on, whether there’s 1 or 100 players online I’ll act the same. I’m not involved with the in-game politics, I have no beef or quarrels with anyone or any players, and I never intend to. I’m not emotionally involved at all, anyone who plays this game I’m thankful too whether they call me a prick or think what we’re doing is good.</p>
<p>Once again, I can promise you:</p>
<p>[b]</p>
<ol>
<li>No in game accounts have been banned.</li>
<li>No in game passwords have been changed.</li>
<li>No in game accounts have been unbanned.</li>
<li>Linus and no other admin can ban except me.<br>
[/b]</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve had issues with our server I sincerely apologize, the only way an in-game account will have been compromized is not from our fault. I can assist in the recovery of any account, but only do the registered email address.</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>

<p>servers shit admins try to pk on diffrent accts most likely set stats to help other players or old friends to get items infested with bots and they do nothing about it shit server wild to big for a population of 20 so yea gg shit server</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I find it funny you say we set stats or help with items, those commands doesn’t even exists. And before this you all RQ’ed cause you saw one of us hit a 26, then later you changed your story to one of us hitting a 29. Yes I admit I pk’d on an friends account, cause I thought the server needs pking, didn’t think it would be much of a problem but obviously it is, so I won’t do it again.</p>
<p>On to the subject, you will see some more updates shortly, we haven’t been able to code any updates last 2 days due to various reasons, but should be able to now.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You can spawn items and set your stats without the commands.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>To clarify what I’m saying is I’m the only person with database access and no one else has the ability to summon items or set their stats such as administrators or moderators besides from me personally.<br>

        <p>Server was ruined. I agree with everything fran has said above.</p>
<p>You guys were allowing botters on your server because you thought it got your playerbase up but made more of us quit. I logged in yesterday to 25 online, 11 x level 3’s were mining in city and mining guild, rest were afk-botting. Economy was ruined, Xp rate should not have been raised, NPC drops should have been implemented upon release of the server not days later, admins shouldnt have been pking on other peoples accounts (especially when server first started).</p>
<p>The only thing you can do to make your server last longterm imo is to take the server down for a week or two, clear the database and implement bug fixes/make few changes before you come back stronger and better.</p>
<p>Even after that I dont know if the 6-10 of us that quit will play again.</p>

        <p>Fran Bitching about his account that he shared getting hacked, how about you retards sharing that smither don’t fucking bot next time?? You deserve to lose the account you I min3 had about 4 chars all botting the first 2 days. As well as misty dawn I have pictures of I min3 saying misty was testing a bot as well.</p>
<p>And Nothing-, why are you so concerned about this server? Why don’t you worry about your own fail server instead of bad mouthing every other server that comes out. You and Crooks put up a new shitty server every few months collect sub money and shut it down. You fail at being an admin, now come say “oh you just throw conspiracy theories out there” when it’s all true you ignorant prick.</p>
<p>Oh noes 6-10 people quit, the servers a week old and it’s doing pretty well, how about people give it a shot before sitting here bad mouthing following fran ta noob and nothing LOL.</p>
