    <description>You will also need to set a variables called &quot;classpath&quot;. Make a new variable and give it the name classpath. No add this in for it&#39;s value:
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin\&quot;

Ok now go into your server source (if you dont have a rar uncompressor you can download 7zip at this link: 7zip, or you can download rar uncompresser at this link: WinRar. Ok now you can right click the compressed source and click &quot;extract here&quot;),
and now when in your server srouce, right click compile.bat and click &quot;edit&quot;. Then erase everything in it and put this in it&#39;s place:
