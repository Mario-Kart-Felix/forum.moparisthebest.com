    <title>Temple of light help please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/temple-of-light-help-please/440174</link>
    <description>I am working on opening the Temple of Light to garner access to the Death Altar. As I am proceeding through the quest opening it up, I noticed that when you return from Lletya with the Newly made Crystal...there is a beam of light going north from the nearest pillar. Yet in mine there is nothing. I have tested all of the object codes surrounding the object code of that particular one, and though they have the colored lights coming down through the top, none give a band of light from one pillar to the next.

My question is, is there a second Temple of Light map, similar to the second Pyramid Agility Course, Draynor Village, Unicorn room in the Underground Pass etc? If so, can someone share its location?
The only known Temple of Light I have is located in the area of  X2044	Y4649.
Thanks a bunch!

Edit: Figured out why it does not work as it should (Maybe)
I think my Temple of Light is not completed in my game. One thing lends credibility to this. There should be a cave from the Underground Pass where the dwarfs are, to the Death Altar. From the temple, there is the cave entrance. But from Underground Pass, there is not. It was not placed in. Though on my friends (newer rsps) it is in fact there. Have already devised a different means of opening the temple.</description>
