    <title>I need help with smithing on a 562 source with anvils, please help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-smithing-on-a-562-source-with-anvils-please-help/414714</link>
    <description>The furnace works fine but the problem is that when I finish smithing a load of any type of bar and go to my bank to take out more bars to use on the anvil to make whatever items it stops working. So if I log out and then log back in it will allow you to use another full inventory of bars on the anvil and then once you try and make another load it stops working again. If anyone has any idea on how to fix this problem please let me know.

I am currently thinking about taking the smithing config files from another server that work and replace them with my cureent ones and run my compiler and see if it fixes this.</description>
