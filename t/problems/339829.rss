    <description>1) When I attack the Kalphite Queen with ranged, mage or melee it always says this:
The Kalphite Queen seems uneffected by your attacks...

How can I fix this that I can attack her with melee, ranged, mage?
 
2) How do I add items of another source/client into mine?
    Does someone has a tutorial about this or something?

Thanx.. (:</description>
