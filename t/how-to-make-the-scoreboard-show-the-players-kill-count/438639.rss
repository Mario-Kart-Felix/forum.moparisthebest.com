    <title>How to Make the Scoreboard show the Players Kill Count</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-the-scoreboard-show-the-players-kill-count/438639</link>
    <description>ok so i have added a scoreboard but it shows the players ranking by their total level. i want it to rank them by their kill count instead. i had a good idea but it didn&#39;t seem to work.. this is what the code it for the total level. getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;Rank &quot;+(i+1)+&quot;: &quot;+rankPpl[i]+ &quot;- Total Level: &quot; +ranks[i], 6402+i);
and this is the code i tried so that it would make the players kill count show instead of total level. getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;Rank &quot;+(i+1)+&quot;: &quot;+rankPpl[i]+ &quot;- Total Kill Count: &quot;+c.KC, 6402+i);
it comes up with an error when i compile that says this: 

src\server\model\players\Client.java:58: error: cannot find symbol
                                getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;Rank &quot;+(i+1)+&quot;: &quot;+rankPpl[
i]+ &quot;- Total Level: &quot;+c.KC, 6402+i);

                      ^
  symbol:   variable c
  location: class Client
