    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-teams/58093</link>
    <description>Looking for alot of people to help code my new, hoping to be UB3R cool, server.
Here&#39;s the info and the positions.
--------------------------------------
--------------------------------------
I am making a new server. It will, technically, be an alternate of TTN (my other server, stands for Trail To Nowhere). The gameplay will be more realistic (more like RuneScape) and it&#39;s name will be: 

Trail To Paradise 

Sounds familiar? Thought so. Items will actually be RARE! 

But, first I need an unedited, completely empty source (or, if possible, on almost exactly like RuneScape.)
FOUND 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
~CODER TEAM~ 
Senior Coder: 
------------------------------ 
Quest Coders: 
1. 
2. 
------------------------------ 
NPC Coders: 
1. 
2. 
------------------------------ 
Spawn Coders: 
1. 
2. 
------------------------------ 
Misc. Coders: 
1. 
2. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

To explain. 

The senior coder is the lead coder, gets the whole source, and pretty much runs this whole process. 

The quest coders code the quests and such into the game. 

The spawn coders code itemspawn and the such into the game. 

The NPC coders code NPC&#39;s and everything to do with NPC&#39;s. 

The misc. coders code everything else, and anything we ask them to. 
_~_~_~_~_~_~_ 
Now, on to the field group, some of the most important people. 
-------------------------------------- 
~FIELD TEAM~ 
Senior FT: 
-------------------------------------- 
NPC FT: 
1. 
2. 
------------------------------------- 
Quest FT: 
1. 
2. 
------------------------------------- 
Item FT: 
1. 
2. 
------------------------------------- 
Misc. FT: 
1. 
2. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
To explain, a field team is a team of people that play RuneScape and take notes/reports on the stuff in it. As I want to make TTP a realistic replay of RS, this team is the most important, and people will need to work together. (Coders cannot be FT members.) 

The senior FT is like the senior coder. 

The NPC FT is the hardest, most grueling job. It requires you to check out almost every NPC - of course, not everyone. We&#39;ll try to put them all in later. 

The quest FT must be an expert RS quester and have completed almost every quest so as to know what makes a quest good and such. 

The item FT must be varied - have good ideas, be nice, work hard, and speak sensibly. This job requires you to have many items in RS and know what the rares are. 

The misc. FT does everything and anything else your senior tells you to. 
------------------------------------------------ 
As you can see, I&#39;m VERY serious about this. Please sign up. I will also post this on moparisthebest.com&#39;s forums. 

You WILL be rewarded, however. Since money will be scarce, here are the rewards for the seniors: 

1. ADMIN spot. 
2. 2000 million gold 
3. Full dragon. 

The normal guys: 

1. Maybe a MOD spot, depends. 
2. 100 million gold. 
3. Full adamant - rune. 

Oh, yeah, and I have 1 more group. 
!_!_!_!_!_!_!_!_!_!_!_!_! 
~FORUM TEAM~ 
Senior FM: 93dcthugs93 
--------------------------- 
Tutorial FM: 
1. 
2. 
--------------------------- 
Application FM: 
1. 
2. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
People in the forum team will be surfing through the forums and finding useful info. 

The senior FM is the same as all seniors. 

The tut. FM will search through the tut. section and find good/cool tuts. and put them up on the private forum for my teams. I will send the link to you. 

The app. FM looks back at the app. thread frequently and sees if anybody wants to join our teams. They will then ask them for expierence etc. (senior can make the rules for joining), and add them to the list. 
______________________________ 
Wow. Lots of writing. I&#39;m SUPER DUPER serious about this one, guys. 
()()()()()()()()()()()() 
Q &amp; A: 
Q: 
Will the old server still be up? 
A: 
Yes. 

Q: 
Will we start doing stuff right away? 
A: 
No, I&#39;ll say when. 
_______________________________ 
So, c&#39;mon. Please join? Great rewards and a great server await.
