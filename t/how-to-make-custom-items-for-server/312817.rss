well if you want to create it you have to good at design and plus you need to know how to use model creators. or if you want to use others. simply download them. copy their int’s and for 317 go to class8.java and for 508’s go to applet_sub1.java and put it there. and copy the models dat’s and into the model folder in your client and go to your server file and click item.cfg and pick an item id that you want the people to wear… for example… team capes who wants it… replace custom model capes with team capes… and compile and edit stats if you want too. and wallahh and btw for 317 open client and type “add model ####”[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 06, 2009, 05:51:31 pm[/size][hr]Btw please give me repss++++++</p>

              <p>You’d want to look at the modelling section, possibly refer to SilentCJ’s tutorial on how to make models, or custom items as you call them. You need to download 1 or more programs for this also.</p>
