    <description>I need help getting my client to have 600+ models/items/anims/gfx.

If one of you is willing to take the time using teamviewer to hook me up, that would be much appreciated.

I&#39;m not sure if this is allowed, but I am willing to pay [b]5.00$[/b] to the person who succesfully solves my problem.

I got paypal, and as you can see you can trust me since I have donated to rune-server myself. (user: parkview111)


Thanks !

ps. I&#39;ve been trying to do this all afternoon, I put the .gzip into index1 folder in my cache, and in the startup ran unpackModels(1); or what ever the statement is.</description>
