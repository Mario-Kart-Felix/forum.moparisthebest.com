    <title>Can&#39;t connect to server on VPS?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-connect-to-server-on-vps/439442</link>
    <description>I have No-IP DUC v3.0.4 up and running, IP Check is fine. I have uTorrent up with settings edited in (Preferences &gt; Connection &gt; Port 43594). I have exceptions added in Windows Firewall for the &#39;43594&#39; port. I have the ip changed in both (&quot;[b]Gui.java[/b]&quot;)s on my desktop (computer I&#39;m connecting from), but I still have a message saying &quot;Error connecting to the server&quot; when I try logging in.

Can someone help me with this? NO, you can&#39;t login to my VPS unless you&#39;re known.</description>
