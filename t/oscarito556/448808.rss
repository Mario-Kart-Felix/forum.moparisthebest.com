    <description>Well yesterday Oscarito556 and one of his friend decided they were going to take over my house and change some things and lock chests in it, etc. Fuscate took care of that a little while later after 10 minutes of explaining to them that they did not own the house nor could they live there. After everything being rolled back Oscar decided to keep coming around and bugging me while I was trying to do stuff and I noticed that he was flying and speed hacking. So I followed him around for a little bit and after I finally got a program downloaded to record the screen I got a video of it.

It&#39;s bad quality because it wasn&#39;t recording at a high fps, which is my fault for choosing Camstudio I do believe. Anyways, I downloaded Camtasia and they fixed my problems and aloud me to convert the video and upload it :P The quality still sucks though. To see the best proof (imo) skip to about 1:40 ..If this video isn&#39;t enough proof I also have another one and a few screenshots of him up in the air.

Also, I logged on this morning to find out that he has stolen my bed yet again...
