    <title>Online petition plan for Parliament to go ahead</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/online-petition-plan-for-parliament-to-go-ahead/375394</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;A plan to allow popular online petitions to be debated in Parliament within a year has been given the go ahead by the government.

Ministers will seek agreement with the authorities, including the House of Commons Procedure Committee, to give the petitions parliamentary time.

The most popular could eventually become Parliamentary bills.

Under the plans, petitions that receive a certain level of support - probably 100,000 signatures - would be debated.

Site change
The government intends to shut down the e-petitions part of the Number 10 website - which has been suspended since the general election - and open a similar facility on the Directgov website.

The new site would be more closely moderated than the old, with petitions checked closely for &quot;eligibility&quot;.

Petitioners would have to be on the electoral roll, and Parliamentary time might also be refused if a topic had been recently debated.

In June, the Leader of the Commons, Sir George Young, said the plans - first spelt out in the Conservative manifesto - would go ahead.

He indicated at the start of December that the petitions website would be moved to Directgov.

A government source told the BBC that the plans had been recently discussed by ministers and the source was very confident they would go ahead.

The proposals have yet to be taken through cabinet, and ministers have not yet discussed them with the Speaker, John Bercow.

Difficult procedure
The consent of Mr Bercow and the Procedure Committee would almost certainly be required.

BBC News political correspondent Ross Hawkins said that allowing petitions to be drafted as Parliamentary bills would be more difficult and would take longer to put in place.

The government envisages using the private member&#39;s bill procedure, which would require an individual MP to support the measure and would be easy for other members to block.

There are no details on how planned legislation would be taken through the Lords.

Petitions were introduced to the Downing Street website by the then prime minister, Tony Blair.

The most popular petition, with more than 180,000 people in support, opposed road pricing.

More than 70,000 supported the one word suggestion that Gordon Brown should &quot;resign&quot;.

And almost 50,000 signed up to the idea that TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson should become prime minister.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>Sorry for my lateness.</p>
<p>Never have I suggested that we should force people to not be religious. Not only would it go against principles of freedom and liberty, it would actually be counter productive as these people would see oppression all around them and become defiant and extreme.</p>
<p>Some religious people want to segregate society down religious lines. If we look at the example of Northern Ireland (96% religious schools) we see children seperated at a young age, they learn that <span class="bbcode-i">those other guys</span> arn’t like us. They follow the wrong god, they don’t believe bread becomes Jesus, they follow a strange man in Rome. Whatever it might be.<br>
This dangerous <span class="bbcode-i">us and them</span> attitude continued the trend that made NI what it is today, a (slowly improving!) basin of unemployment, low economic and social opportunities and a place of misery. And for what? Ideology, dogma and blind faith over reason.</p>
<p>The participants in the most recent riots where children as young as 9, not adults as you’d expect.</p>
<p>And if we try to fix the situation, what happens? “You’re a hypocrite, imposing your anti-religious views on everybody else!”</p>
<p>I don’t want to force anything on anyone, I just wonder why religion is treated so differently to all other ideologies. We don’t see communist or capitalist schools for instance, nor post-modernist, realist, dualist or pragmatist schools. Why then do we see Catholic and Protestant ones?</p>
<p>Although we’ve gotten talking about religious schools, I think the petition I’ll go for will be about tax breaks for churches as its more likely to pass. (very unlikely even so)</p>

<p>Ignoring my perception of what religion is, and why I don’t believe in it, my other biggest problem is that it discredits human achievement. The biggest and best achievements have come from people who decided to start to think outside of what they were told by religion, the same people who were arrested and killed for such thoughts.</p>
<p>Books banned in Italy by the name of the Catholic church, that went on to become some of the most influential pieces of work ever in further helping our understanding of the world, that may very well have helped lead to the same scientific discoveries that have given us the ability to sit here, discussing this on a computer, on the internet, on an online forum.</p>

<p>I know a handful of people who used to be depressed, and when they found a reason to start thinking positively they are no longer depressed. The fact that religion was the kickstart for this cognitive change in your friends cases doesn’t mean that religion or God fixed them. It’s well known that cognitive restructuring can be an effective treatment for some mental disorders, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_restructuring" data-bbcode="true">it’s used in non faith-based treatments too</a>.</p>
<p>You don’t need to dispute that the right mindset can have physical effects, I think most people believe that religious or not.</p>

Thats very good, but are trying to find out the truth, or trying to fit new facts into your religion. If you answer is the last one, it is not very healthy...
<p>Hope you don’t take this offending, I have no problem with religious people like you, only those that try to shove personal beliefs into other people.</p>

</aside>
<p>So he was diagnosed with lung cancer, and when a specialist looked at it he found out it was a different type of cancer. I don’t see any divine intervention there, just doctors somehow mistaking the thyroids for the lungs. Besides, is religion an approved medicine? A lot of American health insurance company’s are ran by Christians, but I don’t see them approving religion and compensate any expenses nor do they encourage anyone to go to church.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The arguments you give are actually arguments that someone with my point of view would say.</p>
<p>Please show me a scientific paper that states that body and mind are two separate entities. Staying positive might be good for survival, which proves my point. If the mind is part of your body, then surely it can have positive and negative influences on your body. The brain is capable of making various substances that make you feel good.</p>
<p>The brain is an organ, and just like just about any other organ like the lungs and heart, the body can function without it. Sure, it needs machines to regulate things, but so does someone undergoing open-heart surgery.</p>

<p>I’m just wondering if you really reflect upon your religion. If you do so, do you do it rationally or not? Are you more open to reason, or more open to rhetoric?</p>

If that is the case, then you shouldn’t tell your children what to eat.  Give them a choice.  If they want to eat a diet consisting of M&amp;Ms and Mountain Dew then so be it, they may weigh 400lbs by the time they are 10, and die from diabetes at 15, but at least you aren’t indoctrinating them with your views on a healthy diet.  Since a parent is so influential, it just wouldn’t be giving them a fair chance to decide for themselves.<br>

<p>That’s up for debate too.  I don’t think I could be spiritually healthy without religion.</p>

<p>Now you are forgetting the difference between fact and personal views. It is proven that a healthy diet is a diet without M&amp;M’s, it isn’t proven that there is a god.

<p>But we don’t <span class="bbcode-b">know</span> for sure what constitutes a healthy diet, we believe certain things, but it varies greatly depending on things like location and tradition.  A lot like religion.  (also, you are confusing your beliefs with religious beliefs, for example, I would say I don’t <span class="bbcode-b">think</span> there is a God, I would say I <span class="bbcode-b">know</span> there is a God, and would want to impart that same knowledge to my children.)</p>

              <p>I don’t think religion should be brought up to be an important part of a child’s life till they’re old enough to naturally start asking questions, and then let them find out for themselves. You tell a child something over and over while they’re growing up, or just a few comments that are of such importance in someones life, like religion and it will stick with them.</p>
<p>That isn’t giving them the choice to decide for themselves. Of course, giving them the freedom to choose is fine. But who is saying they wouldn’t have chosen something different before you had planted the idea of religion into their mind? And a parent being a massively influential figure in their life, it is going to stick.</p>
<p>Educating a child about religion is completely fine. But telling a child that, your god loves you, and speaking about god in a context where it would directly influence that person, isn’t giving them a fair chance at deciding for themselves.</p>

<p>Young children aren’t old enough to make a choice.  You don’t let your 2 year old choose what they want to eat, when to go to bed, whether or not to play with a loaded gun, or if they want to drink bleach do you?  You teach them your beliefs and the lessons you learned in life and hope for the best, if when they grow up old enough to make conscience decisions for themselves and choose to disagree with you on religion, then so be it.  But you can’t just let children ‘choose what they want’.<br>

<p>No one said anything about doing that.  I wasn’t raised like that anyway, sure I was taught about heaven and hell, but also that our God is loving and forgiving, and that if we were truly sorry for something and asked for forgiveness from God he would give it to us.  From your post I get the impression you imagine people saying to their children “If you don’t clean your room like I say you will go to hell”, and it is nothing like that at all.</p>

Right, and the problem is that the more extreme you believes become, the higher chance of forcing it upon other.<br>
Islamic terrorist, aborting doctor murderers, people who try to criminalities homosexuality, discrimination upon non-believer and other not following the “true faith”, people who fear/risk  becoming a outcast because of their believes and/or sexuality, all those things could be prevented by not indoctrinate kinds into hatred.</p>

<p>I don’t feel that way, and I hope you don’t feel I’m pushing my religion on you, like you, I’m just posting my opinion.  I was aiming that at yakman because he posted saying something about a petition to the government regarding religion, presumably to ‘do something’ about religion, and I don’t think the government has any business in what people believe, or don’t believe.  It’s not something that should be regulated by law.</p>

              <p>[quote=“yakman, post:16, topic:375394”]Greeny I wouldn’t mind if religion was only that. I worry about how religious believers affect society.</p>
<p>A third of UK schools are religious schools. The taxpayer funds childhood indoctrination on a massive scale.<br>
26 members of the House of Lords are Bishops. We are the only country other than Iran to have an arrangement like this.<br>
In spite of the massive wealth accumulated by churches, all of their income is tax-free. Everybody subsidies their vile activities.</p>
<p>Yes, religion is clearly nonsense, but it is harmful nonsense.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes religion is dangerous, but it’s only so for the Church because they spent a few centuries practically in power. I have this hypothesis, everything in the world has changed throughout human history - except religion.</p>
<p>You take things from the way we live, to the way we eat, to what we eat. How we work, how we dress, even how we behave. Our scientific values, our principles and our basic assumptions and beliefs about the planet we live on, all these things have changed over the course of human history.</p>
<p>One thing I can think of hasn’t changed throughout human history. It makes no sense to me, because where everything else has moved on, even changed a little these have stayed consistent, still blabbering the same uselessness that they used to be doing. I mean for the bible, and Christianity they wrote that book presuming God created them as the most important thing on the planet, yet Dinosaur fossils disproved the bible long ago (God created the sun, the moon and the stars - but conveniently forgot to mention he tested his plan on a whole different vertebrate here on earth first). Religion is stupid, and religion hasn’t changed. Mass hysteria, mass following - they want to believe and need something to believe in so they believe in something as stupid as a god. That’s dangerous, not the money they have.</p>
<p>And Moparisthebest, I’m sorry if I seemed to be pushing my atheist views on you, although I am critical I promise you I don’t try and influence others, but I will happily express my opinion to them.

No, I’m not for any type of tax breaks or privileges based on any beliefs.  We certainly don’t have them here in the USA, in fact one of the core beliefs we were founded on was separation of church and state.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Churches pay taxes in the USA? I’m not sure about that…[/quote]</p>
<p>No non-profit organization has to pay taxes here.  If a church is a non-profit, then they don’t have to pay taxes, if they are for-profit then they would have to pay taxes.  But the point is it’s not just churches, it’s all non-profit organizations.</p>
