<p>I know of a handful of people personally who used to be depressed and on anti-depressants, and when they found religion they are no longer depressed and no longer need that type of medication.  That’s a measurable improvement.  My own father, back in 2001, was diagnosed with lung cancer from a PET scan, multiple technicians and a few doctors confirmed that it was lung cancer and referred him to a lung cancer specialist, two weeks later he went there and, reading from the same PET scan, it was discovered he didn’t have lung cancer, it was now a much-better thyroid cancer.

<p>That’s because you live under the assumption that mind and body are separated. Sure, philosophy is healthy because it activates the brain, but following a religion means that you don’t question it constantly, and therefor it isn’t healthy at all.</p>

</aside>
<p>Even science and medicine agrees that the mind and body are separate.  Doctors always tell you that your survival statistics for something like cancer are much better if you stay positive, and have a good support group.  Also, the body can survive without the mind, look at people who are comatose, or brain dead.  I don’t see how anyone can claim that the mind and body are not separate.</p>
<p>Also, I can’t speak for all religions of course, just for mine (Catholicism), but we are actually encouraged to constantly question our beliefs and reflect upon them, what’s unhealthy about that?</p>

</aside>
<p>So he was diagnosed with lung cancer, and when a specialist looked at it he found out it was a different type of cancer. I don’t see any divine intervention there, just doctors somehow mistaking the thyroids for the lungs. Besides, is religion an approved medicine? A lot of American health insurance company’s are ran by Christians, but I don’t see them approving religion and compensate any expenses nor do they encourage anyone to go to church.</p>

</aside>
<p>The arguments you give are actually arguments that someone with my point of view would say.</p>
<p>Please show me a scientific paper that states that body and mind are two separate entities. Staying positive might be good for survival, which proves my point. If the mind is part of your body, then surely it can have positive and negative influences on your body. The brain is capable of making various substances that make you feel good.</p>
<p>The brain is an organ, and just like just about any other organ like the lungs and heart, the body can function without it. Sure, it needs machines to regulate things, but so does someone undergoing open-heart surgery.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m just wondering if you really reflect upon your religion. If you do so, do you do it rationally or not? Are you more open to reason, or more open to rhetoric?</p>
<p>Let me get this straight: I’m not trying to insult you, I hope I’m not giving that impression.</p>

        <p>Moparisthebest: I won’t argue about that, of course will people become less depressed if they find something they find meaningful. But I won’t call it divine intervention.</p>

Thats very good, but are trying to find out the truth, or trying to fit new facts into your religion. If you answer is the last one, it is not very healthy...
<p>Hope you don’t take this offending, I have no problem with religious people like you, only those that try to shove personal beliefs into other people.</p>

<p>I know a handful of people who used to be depressed, and when they found a reason to start thinking positively they are no longer depressed. The fact that religion was the kickstart for this cognitive change in your friends cases doesn’t mean that religion or God fixed them. It’s well known that cognitive restructuring can be an effective treatment for some mental disorders, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_restructuring" data-bbcode="true">it’s used in non faith-based treatments too</a>.</p>
<p>You don’t need to dispute that the right mindset can have physical effects, I think most people believe that religious or not.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that is the type rather naive thinking that leads people to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/aug/02/us-daughter-pray-death" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">refusing modern medicine, and praying for better health. </a></p>
<p>Ignoring my perception of what religion is, and why I don’t believe in it, my other biggest problem is that it discredits human achievement. The biggest and best achievements have come from people who decided to start to think outside of what they were told by religion, the same people who were arrested and killed for such thoughts.</p>
<p>Books banned in Italy by the name of the Catholic church, that went on to become some of the most influential pieces of work ever in further helping our understanding of the world, that may very well have helped lead to the same scientific discoveries that have given us the ability to sit here, discussing this on a computer, on the internet, on an online forum.</p>

        <p>Sorry for my lateness.</p>
<p>Never have I suggested that we should force people to not be religious. Not only would it go against principles of freedom and liberty, it would actually be counter productive as these people would see oppression all around them and become defiant and extreme.</p>
<p>Some religious people want to segregate society down religious lines. If we look at the example of Northern Ireland (96% religious schools) we see children seperated at a young age, they learn that <span class="bbcode-i">those other guys</span> arn’t like us. They follow the wrong god, they don’t believe bread becomes Jesus, they follow a strange man in Rome. Whatever it might be.<br>
This dangerous <span class="bbcode-i">us and them</span> attitude continued the trend that made NI what it is today, a (slowly improving!) basin of unemployment, low economic and social opportunities and a place of misery. And for what? Ideology, dogma and blind faith over reason.</p>
<p>The participants in the most recent riots where children as young as 9, not adults as you’d expect.</p>
<p>And if we try to fix the situation, what happens? “You’re a hypocrite, imposing your anti-religious views on everybody else!”</p>
<p>I don’t want to force anything on anyone, I just wonder why religion is treated so differently to all other ideologies. We don’t see communist or capitalist schools for instance, nor post-modernist, realist, dualist or pragmatist schools. Why then do we see Catholic and Protestant ones?</p>
<p>Although we’ve gotten talking about religious schools, I think the petition I’ll go for will be about tax breaks for churches as its more likely to pass. (very unlikely even so)</p>
