    <title>Connection problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-problem/353545</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I own a server, and up until this day, the connection was fine.

Today I turned my server online, and no one connect, and neither could I.

I checked my router, the ipv4 adress was correct, and my no-ip was working fine.

Ive tryed everything and im unsure wat else to try.

But last night some guy said he got my ip, and was gunna hack me, could someone be capable to do that with my ip? Thanks.


I know for sure, I portforwarded right(never touched it, checked) and My DNS in untouched so uh... im confused...
Please no stupid replys...</description>
