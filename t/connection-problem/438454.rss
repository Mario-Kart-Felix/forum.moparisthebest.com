    <title>Connection problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-problem/438454</link>
    <description>A friend and I are trying to connect to my server, I connect fine, but he cannot connect. I have my ip set to my routers ip momentarily, as I do not have no-ip atm. I login fine, yet he is still stuck at &quot;Checking for Updates - 1%&quot; and I do not know how to fix it. does it have to do with me using my router&#39;s ip vs no-ip or something? btw this is a 667/704 base. All help is appreciated.</description>
