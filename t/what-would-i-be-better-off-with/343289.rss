    <title>What would I be better off with?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-would-i-be-better-off-with/343289</link>
    <description>Alright, my graduation is coming up and I&#39;m expecting enough money to buy a 360. However, I&#39;m not entirely sure what I should do for Live. Should I get the Wireless N adapter, or should I use a powerline system (something such as [url=http://www.belkin.com/IWCatSectionView.process?Section_Id=206578]this[/url])?</description>

<p>I care about $7/month when I play my PS3 a few hours a month at most.  If you purchase a game for $50 or more, you shouldn’t have to pay to play it online.  Not to mention how inferior xbox is to ps3, and how many xboxes die every day.</p>
<p>And the president of the USA is going to pay $7/month for me to play online?  That makes no sense at all.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/chassy">@Chassy</a>  I don’t think my parents would let me move the router mainly because my mom’s desktop is wired to it. There’s a good 30 - 40 feet and another floor between my room and the router, so ethernet cables aren’t exactly an option for me. However, I still get 4 bars connection using my wireless adapter, and its on 2.4GHz, where as an XBox N adapter can use 5GHz if I remember correctly. I was just wondering which I would be better off with speed-wise.</p>

              <p>Aren’t both of those at least $100+?</p>
<p>If they are both for connecting to Xbox Live, I just use an ethernet cable. You can buy a longer ethernet cable than what the default one is for like 10 dollars, and HD cables for like 30$. I am assuming your router isn’t near your Xbox though, but I would see if you can move it before spending that kind of money.</p>
