    <title>Need Help with an Ad/Flier. reward = &lt;3</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-an-ad-flier-reward-3/117847</link>
    <description>I was wondering if somebody could reconstruct this a little.  Its for my dad&#39;s company, and he wanted me to shape it up.  I want it to have the same general layout and feel to it (plain and simple), but it could use some improvements.  My dad wants it to have the same wording, but maybe a new picture. 
I would greatly appreciate anybody could do this for me, and you will have my eternal love &lt;3  I know some of you guys are really good in that &#39;elegant&#39; type of work, and I would rather leave my trust in your skills over mine.
A PSD would be nice as well, so further adjustments will be pain-free.

And at the moment, this is what I threw together to stall for time.  I wish it actually looked somewhat appealing

<p>Well, when my step dads company was going to set up a website they went to this web design business thing, and they said they would set it up and look after it for him for £4.000, and my step dad knowing nothing about it was like “YER OK”, so i was liek “OK WTF I B SET UP A SITE FOR U FOR FREE”, so in the end it  isnt trampy, its easier, its cheaper and im always around to sort it out <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I’m making them because the guys who they hired suck worse than me.  My dad wanted some things changed and they kept saying they’re “busy”.  As if they don’t have enough time to draw shit stuff like that for a living.<br>

<p>Basically, I want a completely new flier that looks very professional and appealing.  Something worth 50 bucks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Since I’m no good at that, I only changed colors for the time being.</p>
