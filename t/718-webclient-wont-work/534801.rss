    <title>718 Webclient Wont Work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-webclient-wont-work/534801</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, Ive ran webclients in the past, never on a 718 though. &amp; recently I decided to make a 718, I did, and I am now attempting to put it onto a webclient. I&#39;ve .Jared it correctly, and I believe I&#39;ve done every step correctly..

As I pull up my .html it continues to tell me that It can not find my Loader.class...
Well Its nearly impossible for it not to find it, because i re-did my jar 4 times, to make sure I was jaring through bin. which then led to bin/Loader.class.

I&#39;ve re-looked constantly to make sure it&#39;s there. &amp; it is..... I&#39;m not sure what else to do.. Anyone have any suggestions?

              <p>Hmm…  On dropbox do you have a public folder because someone else had the same problem with there’s it said client.class &amp; they didn’t have a public folder so I enabled one for them and uploaded the jar to the public folder and then it started to work!!</p>
