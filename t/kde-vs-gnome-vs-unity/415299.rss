    <title>KDE vs Gnome vs unity</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/kde-vs-gnome-vs-unity/415299</link>
    <description>Ok i was thinking about what desktop environment i should use when in the near future i wipe my computer and do a full HDD install of ubuntu.

I have an i3, 4gigs ddr3(I think i can upgrade it to 8gigs but would rather just save up and buy a better computer[its more practical for me to buy a new better laptop, than to build a PC, just b/c the laptop is portable. but i guess i could build the PC and just teamviewer it from my current laptop.]), and a 360gig HDD.

anyways, i planning on using virtualbox with a win7 vm for windows only needs and use linux for everything else.

I want a medium of performance, aesthetics, and features(visual effect, and programs available) for my laptop. so my question is what are your opinions and experiences with each desktop environment, and what is you suggestion based upon my hardware and my desire?

i looked at photos of Gnome 3, kde 4.6, and unity. unity looks neat, and simple, with some nice functions. kde im not familiar with at all really, it looks ok, and idk what features come with it.

Gnome 3 to me is the most visually appealing, and looks like it has nice features, but i read from this article: http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/12068_3930006_3/GNOME-vs-KDE-The-Latest-Round.htm (idk if its biased though b/c as i skimmed through it i saw a lot of bashing on gnome, hardly any positive comments, very few comment on kde, and didn&#39;t really see anything against kde. which all that made me think the write may have been a little biased on the comparison idk i didn&#39;t fully read it, nor do i know anything about that site or writer.) says that Gnome 3 uses nearly 1 gig of ram, and causes you to do a lot of switching. idk if gnome 3 would cause me to lose too much performance or if it would be ok with my computers resources.

thx in advanced.</description>

<p>ok so maybe gnome. afaik installing gnome only messes up unity(so correct me if im wrong on that). i made a vm out of my physical machine so its pretty much backed up. but im wondering if i should make a back up of the OS instead of just having a vmdk file(b/c what if it gets corrupt or something bad then i would lose all my data).</p>
<p>so this is what im thinking about doing in the next few days. doing a clean install of xp pro sp3(for playing windows games) on a 20gig partition(im going to buy an external HDD to install the games to, connected via eSATA[something like this, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Momentus-7200RPM-Hybrid-ST95005620AS-Bare/dp/B003NSBF32" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Momentus-7200RPM-Hybrid-ST95005620AS-Bare/dp/B003NSBF32</a> in this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-2-5-Inch-eSATA-External-Enclosure/dp/B0014BJIF2" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-2-5-Inch-eSATA-External-Enclosure/dp/B0014BJIF2</a>]), then install ubuntu on the other 300gigs, and install gnome 3. after that install the bare minimum software i need on xp and ubuntu. work out some convention to keep all my data organized.</p>
<p>ill have multiple VMs that do different things to keep my host OSs from getting bloated(yes it will take up disk space having multiple VMs but im not going have a lot maybe 3 at the most, and boot time will stay fast, and i can pause, take snapshots, and save the execution state. on a NTFS partition so win xp can use the VMs if needed.). the one vm will be my old HDD data which will remain on my external HDD, the other will be some smaller linux that can run all the programs i would need on linux, and maybe another win xp with a 10 gig(maybe more if needed) HDD for programs i need that arent games and wine cant run.</p>
<p>I wish i had the money to buy a new laptop… this one sucks and wasnt made for games(stupid intel hd gfx).</p>

              <p>I have xubuntu right now. its ok but i would like more feature like windows. I dont like windows for like everything but some of the feature are convenient, and nice workflow. like window snapping, virtual desktops, compiz. I like the aesthetic but not so much that it hampers performance too much. i mean i expect some performance lose but i only want as much as i can afford in resources. if you had a 24gig ddr3 1666mhz, i7-EE 3ghz, and dual sli-enabled GeForce GTX 590’s then its not going to really matter what desktop environment you use, performance-wise.</p>
<p>i would like a “pretty looking environment” and i would think my hardware can handle it. The only thing keeping me from doing this right now, is backing my programs up(like my cracked full CS5 master collection. i dont have the install package, nor do i have the keygen that i used. that is really the only thing i care about keeping, am i correct that if i backup those reg keys and some other things i could move the adobe suite to the vm i make? or will i just have to find the CS 5.5 install package, and get a new keygen?).</p>

<p>I want a medium of performance, aesthetics, and features(visual effect, and programs available) for my laptop. so my question is what are your opinions and experiences with each desktop environment, and what is you suggestion based upon my hardware and my desire?</p>
<p>i looked at photos of Gnome 3, kde 4.6, and unity. unity looks neat, and simple, with some nice functions. kde im not familiar with at all really, it looks ok, and idk what features come with it.</p>
<p>Gnome 3 to me is the most visually appealing, and looks like it has nice features, but i read from this article: <a href="http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/12068_3930006_3/GNOME-vs-KDE-The-Latest-Round.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/12068_3930006_3/GNOME-vs-KDE-The-Latest-Round.htm</a> (idk if its biased though b/c as i skimmed through it i saw a lot of bashing on gnome, hardly any positive comments, very few comment on kde, and didn’t really see anything against kde. which all that made me think the write may have been a little biased on the comparison idk i didn’t fully read it, nor do i know anything about that site or writer.) says that Gnome 3 uses nearly 1 gig of ram, and causes you to do a lot of switching. idk if gnome 3 would cause me to lose too much performance or if it would be ok with my computers resources.</p>
<p>thx in advanced.</p>
