    <description>ok im not the best coder in the world i still have a nice few troubles but thats besides the point.
i want to make a server that brings back the meening of fun and awsomeness because most servers today have only a few things. i want to try and recreat what bullet made because people loved that.
if you want to join post your name here with your skills and age( age realy doesnt matter you dont have to if u dont wanna)
we will need a host. so if anyones willing to host without stealing our server then well go ahead.
we will need a good source if anybody knows one because all the ones i have are crap. and we will need a dedicated team.
if you make the team i will pm you (most likely you will unless we are full) but like they say &quot;the more the maryer&quot;
ok im done and dont forget its for fun. we want to bring back good memories of mopar.
ps: we will also need a server name</description>
