PRISONERZ BETA IS ONLINE JOIN IN NOW :D

[URL=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,637677.0.html][b][color=brown]♟ PRISONERZ BETA IS ONLINE JOIN IN NOW :D[/size]

[/size][size=14pt][b]What is the idea of this game, what makes it unique?[/b][/size][size=1em]
It&#39;s been over 5 years, you&#39;ve been in jail since 2008 and your punishment is nearly complete. 
Since you were leader of the rebellion, everyone saw you as a respected leader; But during your prison years lots of them have been forgotten your name.

[b][i]You got released out of prison.[/i] [/b]But on one condition; The human rights you always had, will be gone. Your respected leader title has been fallen, and is changed to a slaves one. but there&#39;s hope, you can train &amp; master your skills again, show people that the respected person you always were has been returned.

[/size][size=18pt][b]Starting up your life again.[/b][/size][size=1em]
There you are, on an island in between Karamja and Al Kharid: ♯Sʟᴀᴠᴇ Isʟᴀɴᴅ♯ which 
contains only the most fearest prison in ☬ Prisonerz ☬.

[b]A Dangerous World.[/b]
Ever seen the movie Django Unchained? it has the same idea: 
The world is tough, like in real life; you can attack anyone, anywhere you are: 
But this could have consequences, like if the security (players with a higher rank) ever will spot this,
you&#39;ll have to deal with punishments.


[b]Forms of Danger.[/b]
Like in the wild-west, there are people hired by other people to kill a specific player: Bᴏᴜɴᴛʏ Hᴜɴᴛᴇʀs
Bounty Hunters, are risking their freedom and are most wanted criminals in-game.

I took it like you meant people can “pk” each other. This is more like if you are going to be a murderer…you may get murdered yourself.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Exactly, like you just said. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Prisonerz is not meant to be a PK server. If you kill anyone (which you can anytime) you<br>
should know there could be consequences, if a sherrif would caught you doing that, he could lock ya up. And you<br>
would be forced to pay a price. Which rather a friend of you, or yourself need to pay to get outta prison.</p>
<p>Now, if anyone kills you ‘and it’s not in the wildy, you won’t lose any items.’ Hope you guys like the idea :)[/quote]</p>
<p>hmm interesting idk if i would like this i think it would depend on how the other players use this privilege, would there be a combat level difference outside of wildy for pking still? also what are some other ranks you plan to use rather than slave? btw i really like the idea of your project atleast its something more unique than all the other regular rsps’s</p>

ok wait so your saying players can be killed anywhere?<br>

<p>[URL=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,637677.0.html][b][color=brown]♟ PRISONERZ BETA IS ONLINE JOIN IN NOW :D[/size]</p>
<p>[/size][size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">What is the idea of this game, what makes it unique?</span>[/size][size=1em]<br>
It’s been over 5 years, you’ve been in jail since 2008 and your punishment is nearly complete.<br>
Since you were leader of the rebellion, everyone saw you as a respected leader; But during your prison years lots of them have been forgotten your name.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">You got released out of prison.</span> </span>But on one condition; The human rights you always had, will be gone. Your respected leader title has been fallen, and is changed to a slaves one. but there’s hope, you can train &amp; master your skills again, show people that the respected person you always were has been returned.</p>
<p>[/size][size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Starting up your life again.</span>[/size][size=1em]<br>
There you are, on an island in between Karamja and Al Kharid: ♯Sʟᴀᴠᴇ Isʟᴀɴᴅ♯ which<br>
contains only the most fearest prison in ☬ Prisonerz ☬.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">A Dangerous World.</span><br>
Ever seen the movie Django Unchained? it has the same idea:<br>
The world is tough, like in real life; you can attack anyone, anywhere you are:<br>
But this could have consequences, like if the security (players with a higher rank) ever will spot this,<br>
you’ll have to deal with punishments.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Forms of Danger.</span><br>
Like in the wild-west, there are people hired by other people to kill a specific player: Bᴏᴜɴᴛʏ Hᴜɴᴛᴇʀs<br>
Bounty Hunters, are risking their freedom and are most wanted criminals in-game.</p>
<p><a href="http://prisonerzofficial.blogspot.nl/p/give-us-feeback.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">It would amazing, if you guys could post some feedback on my blog about this RSPS, it would be greatly appreciated!<br>
