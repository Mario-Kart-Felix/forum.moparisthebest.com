    <title>PhpMyAdmin is being retarded</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/phpmyadmin-is-being-retarded/433336</link>
    <description>I&#39;m switching webhosts, and I backed up my SMF forum database.

When I import the SQL file, it says that it has done it correctly. No errors arise.

However, only a couple of tables are actually there. To be specific, around 30%.

I see tables between &quot;attachments&quot; to &quot;log_banned&quot;, and from &quot;log_boards&quot; to &quot;topics&quot; there are no tables that were created. 12/38 tables. Pathetic.

I thought it was probably the max amount of lines that could be executed, so I made sure that when I exported the database that there be no maximum.

I searched the missing tables in the gigantic SQL file and sure enough, they were there. So it&#39;s not a problem with exporting.

I also tried importing without this checked: &quot;Allow the interruption of an import in case the script detects it is close to the PHP timeout limit. (This might be good way to import large files, however it can break transactions.)&quot;

Any ideas?</description>

<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>OP, what you should’ve checked was if those 18 tables it did import were in order. It would’ve been easier to identify if it was timing out or just a bad dump.</p>

<p>Yea I’m in the process of doing that and it’s driving me crazy. Our forum has over 20K posts and there are a few tables that for some reason I can’t even import completely. I wonder how MS deals with this.<br>

20k posts is not a significant number, did you happen to check the checksum of the upload to make sure its not something with your or the servers connection during transfer[/quote]</p>
<p>Sorry, I’m not sure what that is, but I did the transfer on the same server via localhost.</p>
<p>I have found a solution to my problem. This tool: <a href="http://www.ozerov.de/bigdump" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Big Dump</a> was hella awesome. Great tool, I should have searched for something like this from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone.</p>
