    <title>Iphone ESN</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/iphone-esn/437567</link>
    <description>Recently I&#39;ve tried selling my Iphone 4s on Ebay. Some Retard clicked buy it now on accident and cancelled my listing. Anyways, I think my ESN Is bad. I&#39;ve done a bitch of research to find out, and if i understand correctly, an esn is basically a number that activates the phone. If my bill is extremely far behind, my phone cannot be activated by anyone due to my ESN being bad, correct? My phone is $400 over payment (dont ask, mom is a noob) so therefore my ESN would be bad, correct? And with a bad esn, noone would buy it, right?

What my question is, does anyone ever buy Iphones with a bad ESN? If I could at least get $2-300 off my Iphone with a bad ESN, I could switch to verzion, as im trying to do, and add a line and get my new Iphone on Verizon for $200.</description>

<p><span class="mention">@OP</span> - Nobody will buy this if it has a bad esn unless they want it for a media device. But with that being said. There are ways to change the esn, although highly illegal. you’ll be lucky to get anything around $100 as it cant even be used for a developers device, since it cant be activated a dev cannot test. either accept the fact you now have a expensive media device or sell it dirt cheap. I got $50 in my wallet, where you live? lol</p>
