    <description>Hello, RigidScape is a server created by my friend, along with a couple of his buddies.
It&#39;s brand new, just released off of BETA. It&#39;s had 12 long months in beta being developed to guarantee absolute player satisfaction. It&#39;s 753, there&#39;s a new feature coming shortly so you can change which revision you play on. ( for those who like the old school look. ) It has every item you can think of plus some custom items, which you can see on forum or ingame. There&#39;s custom bosses, and there&#39;s 2 that are going to be released within a few days. There&#39;s a couple custom quest, a new player feature that&#39;s literally NEVER been seen before coming in the next batch update. You&#39;ll get more info on the website soon. Players are gonna LOVE this new feature to the max. There&#39;s so much more, I can&#39;t even type it all. Please come check us out, you won&#39;t regret it.
