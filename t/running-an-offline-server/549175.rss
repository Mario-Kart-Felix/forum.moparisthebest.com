    <title>Running an Offline Server</title>

    <description>Hi, I&#39;m new to private servers (so I will most definitely ask questions that are stupid). I want to play around with a private server as a fun way to teach myself some javascript. I&#39;m currently in college (and on campus), so I cannot change the firewall settings in order to make my server public (portforwarding) because I&#39;m on campus-wide wifi. I don&#39;t really care if my server is public, all I want to do is play it by myself and make changes to it. How do I do this? 

I followed the guide provided here: https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,342685.0.html 

When I try to run the client, I get &quot;Could not find or load main class JFrame&quot;

I feel stupid, but I have to ask at some point.</description>

The JavaScript programming language, developed by Netscape, Inc., is not part of the Java platform.
<p>JavaScript does not create applets or stand-alone applications. In its most common form, JavaScript resides inside HTML documents, and can provide levels of interactivity to web pages that are not achievable with simple HTML.</p>
<p>Key differences between Java and JavaScript:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language.[/li]<br>
[li]Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser only.[/li]<br>
[li]Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.[/li]<br>
[li]They require different plug-ins.[/li][/ul]</p>

Hey there,<br>
so, basically the tutorial shows you how to run a server. But there is no Client link nor Source link given. The author redirects you to the download section for Rs2 resources from Moparscape. Which base are you using (Could be Delta, PI and many more)? Which Client are you using? (Galkons?). Post the run.bat you have. An advice: I’d prefer to use an IDE, called eclipse, it does all the hard work for you and makes programming as comfort as possible. Here is a link on how to setup eclipse: <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=527293.0" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=527293.0</a>. Hope i could help you!</p>
