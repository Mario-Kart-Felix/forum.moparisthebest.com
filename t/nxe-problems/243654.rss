    <description>Okay, I got an email from microsoft saying I had been selected for the NXE beta testing,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Xbox 360 Fall Flash update will be available to you by 2pm PST on November 14th (5pm EST on November 14th, 10pm GMT on November 14th). 


If you would like to post comments regarding your experiences with the New Xbox Experience, or interact with other preview participants please use the Newsgroups link on the connect site. 


If you need technical assistance with the Xbox 360 Fall Flash and you&#39;re in the US or Canada and speak English; you can also call 877-783-1507. Phone lines will be open between the hours of 8am and 6pm CST. Do not publish or otherwise share this phone number with people that are not participating in the preview.


In participation with this program, you should not move your storage device (hard drive, or memory unit if you do not have a hard drive) to any other console as it will also update that console. If an unregistered console is updated with the NXE update, that console will not be able to connect to Xbox LIVE until the NXE has been officially released on November 19th.


Please remember that your participation in the Public Preview Program is subject to the Xbox LIVE Terms of Use.


We thank you for your participation and hope that you enjoy the New Xbox Experience.


See you online,


The Xbox 360 team

So, I not reading what time I would be prompted to download, I forgot about time-zones etc, so I googled (at this stage I didn&#39;t know about the NXE leaking, where you cannot connect until the 19th), so I followed a tutorial on how to install etc, installed it successfully.

Now, I can&#39;t connect and after a bit of research have found about the NXE leaking which bans you - anyway to remove this dashboard?</description>

<p>Nah, but it is pretty cool some of the stuff you can do without having a game on the dashboard, but the avatar thing is purely stolen from the Nintendo Wii.</p>
