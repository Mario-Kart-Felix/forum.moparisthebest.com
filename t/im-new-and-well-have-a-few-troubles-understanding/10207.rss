    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-new-and-well-have-a-few-troubles-understanding/10207</link>
    <description>Ok yes I am new just started today and I would like to make my own server and already have the downloads and all done just dont know how to import things...of course I thought i could use my like HTML brain but this is used my Java and I dont know that...yet...anyways

Can someone please answer my questions?

1. How to you have your server online and how do you well....get on it?

2. What is client.java? i see some codes and says Open Client.Java and well I dont know what that is so...What is it and where can i find it?

3. Where can you find a easy understanding Java Tutorial?

4. How does the whole putting monsters and everything where you want it work?

I&#39;m sorry about asking I am just dont want to sit here stressed and not get anywhere when i could be learning something new! I would really like to start up this server for well...mostly for my family to play on and I told them about it and they are really excited and pumped so...I dont want to let them down... 

Thank You!</description>

              <p>If you dont know how to program java, the best way to start a server just to play on is to download moparscape 3.0, then click “start server”</p>
<p>otherwise there are many tutorials you can read to do everything you want <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
