    <title>[Experienced Client Developer Needed]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/experienced-client-developer-needed/531670</link>
    <description>I have a server I&#39;ve been coding for a few months now.
Started off from Deception client and server which is based off Exitium/Xyle which is based off Pi.
So please have experience coding with these!
My other developer has gone away and I am now working on this project on my own.
I&#39;m looking for an advanced client developer + basic server coding skills aswell.
Post or PM me with information on what skills you have + your experience.
I&#39;d post pictures and all that stuff but I&#39;d rather not waste time uploading when I can be coding.
Please don&#39;t post if you don&#39;t even know how to do basic stuff... This is a serious request.
