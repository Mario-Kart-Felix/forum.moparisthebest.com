    <description>Hello!

We are The Nation Minecraft and we want to make our community channel grow and become something awesome. At the moment we are recruiting directors for our channel across a range of subjects from tutorials to LP&#39;s.

We just made a tutorial on how to build a self reliant sugarcane farming machine and also a piston trap that could be used underground too, if you could check them out it would be great. Feedback would be appreciated also.
We want dedicated people to help out, and it will be good for you if you are good at minecraft and want to get a start in the world of YouTube.

If you take the time to watch it, you will like it alot, and a guarentee you will enjoy the content.

Cheers.</description>
