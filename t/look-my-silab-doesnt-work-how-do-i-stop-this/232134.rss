    <description>[b][u]It Says[/u]
 Error_loader_client - Unable to download client.
silabclient was unable to download the client file

# Login to your computer as an &#39;administator&#39; user, and then try loading silabclient again. This should give it sufficient access to create save client cache file.

# Or, create a new directory called C:\WINDOWS\.silabclient_store_32 or /.silabclient_store_32. If possible, set that directory to have full read+write permissions so that all users can write to it. silabclient should then detect that directory and use it for its files.

# Make sure to accept the java signature it looks like this:


if the signature does not come up for you, some security software or parental settings may be perventing you from accepting it.
