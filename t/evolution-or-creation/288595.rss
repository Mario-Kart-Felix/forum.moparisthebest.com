    <title>Evolution Or Creation?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/evolution-or-creation/288595</link>
    <description>I am curious to see what people will say to this.

I believe that god created the earth using evolution.

Kind of a mix of the both.

I know it sounds kind of weird but that is wat i believe so... Fuc da haterrrzz pl0x

Also please don&#39;t flame people because of what they believe in.

I do not want this to turn into onje huge argument.

I jsut want to know what people think.</description>

<p>Blasphemy is caused by free will, and God gave us free will,so we are able to do it but not permitted.</p>
<p>Crime is a result of many problems and free will, you have to solve all the problems in the world and then you may have just a little crime left.</p>

</aside>
<p>The technology required to build such a huge ship would be too futuristic for one guy and his family. 2.5 million animals, the size of the animals would average around the size of a human. It is impossible to build a ship for 2.5 million humans from wood. Steel isn’t up to that task either. Modern cruise ships can carry up to 20.000 people if you fill the casino’s etc. And that’s a really really rough estimate. So you need space for 2.5 million animals and space for various kinds of food. Average animals eat about 2 kg a day, so that’s 5 million kg of food per day and 2.5 million * 80kg for average animals. Let’s say this flood came and went (where did the water go?) in 10 days. That requires a ship capable of keeping 250 million kg afloat. I don’t know what the buoyancy of the wood used is, but let’s say 1 kg of wood can keep itself and 1 kg extra floating (this kind of wood doesn’t exist, the max is about 830kg extra per 1000kg of wood). That requires 125 million kg of wood. I don’t know what wood was popular those days, but let’s say the average density of wood was 600 kg/cu.m This requires 208333 cubic metres of wood!</p>
<p>Some might say that Noah was helped by god, but if a god is powerful enough to construct an impossible ship he might aswel just make everyone vanish and start all over again.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that every animal including humans would be retarded and malformed now. Oh wait, of course, god can prevent that. But he can’t prevent crime and blasphemy?</p>

<p>Yes, some do, I’ve spoken to them.</p>
<p>They believe all the common-sense stuff about modern medicine, science and all that stuff. But also believe things like water-into-wine, walking-on-water, resurrection and virgin birth.<br>
Its really wierd.</p>
<p>Without meaning to labour the point, they literally believe that stuff. I asked this guy if he believed that Jesus literally made water molecules change into the mixture of ethanol and acids that make up wine and he said yes!</p>
<p>I suspect they practise doublethink, as described in Nineteen Eighty Four by George Orwell.</p>
<p>There are people who travel around the Red Sea looking for the possible spot where it was parted. People believed the Turin Shroud was the cloth Jesus’s body was wrapped up in. There are people who try to study so-called Flood Geology, where all of geology is interpreted in terms of Noah’s flood.</p>
<p>Theres some people who take their beliefs very seriously, in a way that would probably seem strange to many of us.</p>

<p>There are some sects who say its literal, some say metaphorical. Which interpretation is correct? All those sects assert that they alone are correct and that other sects are wrong.<br>
Theres nothing in the bible which says “take this part literally, take this part metaphorically”.</p>
<p>I’m not convinced that you’re meant to take that part metaphorically.</p>

<p>The majority of the Christians base their life on the bible. If the first stories are false, why would you still believe the rest? If you life by the laws of your country, and you find out that the constitution allows the government to enslave you (just an example), you’ll start to doubt the honesty of the other laws too, won’t you?</p>

<p>I’d like to also mention that the ancient greeks thought the earth was a perfect sphere, also the ancient chinese knew the earth was spherical somehow.<br>
This was over 2000 years ago.</p>
<p>But my real reason for posting is that I got a question to ask to all Christians regarding evolution and their religion.<br>
actually its not so much a question, more of a request to look over my reasoning.</p>
<p>I’ve got this flow of logic, I’d like to see if you accept it.</p>
<ol>
<li>The current scientific view of evolution is more or less correct.</li>
<li>Therefore, Adam and Eve were not the first humans created by god and quite possibly they didnt exist.</li>
<li>Therefore, is no original sin for everyone to inherit.</li>
<li>Jesus died for our sins, he cleared up original sin for those who accept him.</li>
<li>If original sin does not exist, Jesus died for nothing.</li>
<li>Therefore Christianity is all wrong.</li>

<p>Now you are the one generalizing.

<p>That would be because God wasn’t created, he has always existed and always will.  (for an explanation of how this is ‘scientifically’ possible, or to debate this further, view my ‘God, from a programmers point of view’ thread so as not to derail this one)</p>
<p>The creator of this thread is one of the few who seems to have the same idea about this that I have.  People generally think that the big bang theory and evolution contradict the existence of a greater power, when there is no reason for this.  Nothing says that God couldn’t have put into motion the Big Bang (something did, and scientists don’t know what it was) and also made the rules for evolution and put them into motion.</p>
