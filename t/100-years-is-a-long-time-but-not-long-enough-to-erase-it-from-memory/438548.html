        <p>100 years ago yesterday a ocean liner was completed for the first time. It was not known at the time, but this ocean liner would go down in history as the most famous maritime disaster of all time. Her lifespan…12 days. Her name…RMS Titanic.</p>
<p>I have been fascinated by this “Ship of Dreams” since I was about 7, and got a hold of my dad’s book “Men, Ships, and the Sea.” That was back in 1984. I remember clearly the image in the book, which is what caught my interest. The stern of the ship, risen high in the air, water dripping, people rowing away, people jumping. A large iceberg on the side. That picture conveyed so much information in a single panel. gave an idea of the scope of what was happening to the largest ship in the world in 1912.<br>
At that time, we had no clue about the Titanic, outside of the fact that she sank on April 15, 1912 at 2:18 AM in the Atlantic Ocean. Took some 1514 people with her to the sea, the youngest being a small baby. After looking at the picture time and time again, it was a year later, that the subject of the Titanic came into our 3rd grade class. She had been found in the beginning of the school year. And really it was so important of a find, that we as 3rd graders were looking and reading the papers, the national Geographic, etc on the find, discussing all the new information. including the discovery that she did indeed split in half as she made her final plunge. We were taught about everything that happened afterwards. The changes in regulations, safety protocols, everything that happened because of this one tragedy, that as my teacher put it “Did not have to happen.”</p>
<p>But for some reason it did not sink in quite so well. I mean I knew what happened, I knew how many people died, etc. But there was no reality of it. How could there be? I was born in 1977, some 55 years later. In 1997, we were given the ability to see it first hand on film as the absolute tragedy that it was shown in real life as it were. Though I complacently HATE the love story behind the film Titanic, I can say that is perhaps the best representation of how the ship met her end, and how the people aboard suffered, panicked, and died as she took them with her. It showed us that this was not just a romantic tale, but something that was at the time earth shattering, tragic, life altering, and should have never come to pass.<br>
So many things made her doom more impending.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sailing full speed, despite iceberg warnings all day April 14</li>
<li>SS Californian, who was confirmed to be within sight of the Titanic as she sank (15 miles away) Did not turn her wireless back on that night, nor did the captain do anything to find out about the multiple rockets fired by the Titanic. They could have been there and saved an estimated 600+ more people. They rather ignored it all, until morning.</li>
<li>The missing binoculars for the lookouts that were lost in South Hampton.</li>
<li>Lacking lifeboats for the entire accompaniment aboard.<br>
The list goes on. And thus there is nothing that can be done now. All involved have since passed, and white Star as a individual company no longer exists. (fused with another company)</li>
</ul>
<p>I still study her even now. As we have learned so many new things. Her breakup was not quite as it was said when she was first discovered. There was no huge gash made in her side, but rather more like 15 cuts along the hull. Just enough to enter 6 compartments. Enough to take her down into the dark and into history.</p>
<p>I know this has nothing to do with RS, RSPS, or anything Moparscape discusses. Most likely a dead and boring topic for most past my generation. But it is in a way out of respect for the ones who did pass, that I ask:<br>
On April 14th at 9:20 PM (Mountain Time), 8:20 PM (Pacific Time), 10:20 PM(Central Time), 11:20 PM(Eastern Time)<br>
(The proper time differences of the final sinking in these time zones)that we take a moment of silence for the 1514 souls who died that night in 1912, and for the ship who took them with her.</p>
<p>Funny…it is because of this ship, even some 100 years later, that I will never get on one as long as I live.</p>

        <p>I hate it when people are afraid that the boat will sink.  I’ve been on 1 cruise before and it went off without a hitch, it was even the ship’s maiden voyage.  Ships sinking today are ungodly rare, plus even if they did, rescue crews would be on the way within a matter of minutes, it’s not like everyone just dies instantly.</p>

All the time. Difference…? I am in control of my car.<br>
Add to the calculation here…how many cars are on the road vs planes in the air or ships sailing the oceans that help that calculation out? Are they safer cause they ARE safer…or are they safer just simply cause there are less of them, thus less idiots in control of them <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

Add to the calculation here…how many cars are on the road vs planes in the air or ships sailing the oceans that help that calculation out? Are they safer cause they ARE safer…or are they safer just simply cause there are less of them, thus less idiots in control of them :D[/quote]<br>
They are safer because they are in the hands of professionals, and for every 1000 cars / planes / boats, the cars will crash and kill the most, followed by planes, then boats.</p>

<p>@ M1lkman. The history is somewhat correct, but not completely in the movie. Historically accurate people are depicted, but the central characters of Rose (family), Jack, and Cal are not. Completely made up by James Cameron. No Heart of the Ocean, or anything like that lol. It is the best representation however of what is commonly thought of how the ship went under.</p>
<p>@ Speljohan Exactly which of the people deserved it? Of course fingers point at the captain and ship builder…and they both died. Only one person I think would deserve the fate since it is over half of his fault, and he lived. Ishmay…chairman of White Star at the time. Now the rest of the 1513 that did not make it…which of them got what they deserved?</p>

I hope this is all a big joke.  That’s not the reason at all.<br>
How many 16 year olds are there on the road? In the ocean? Flying airplanes?  You are 35 sir and sound like you’re 5. And yes while you can control YOUR car you cant control other people, which is why people constantly get rear ended, t-boned, ran off the road…  When I started reading this thread it was interesting, then you came back and turned it into a “look how retarded I am” thread.</p>

<p>All the time. Difference…? I am in control of my car.<br>
Add to the calculation here…how many cars are on the road vs planes in the air or ships sailing the oceans that help that calculation out? Are they safer cause they ARE safer…or are they safer just simply cause there are less of them, thus less idiots in control of them <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>

I hope this is all a big joke.  That’s not the reason at all.<br>
How many 16 year olds are there on the road? In the ocean? Flying airplanes?  You are 35 sir and sound like you’re 5. And yes while you can control YOUR car you cant control other people, which is why people constantly get rear ended, t-boned, ran off the road…  When I started reading this thread it was interesting, then you came back and turned it into a “look how retarded I am” thread.[/quote]<br>
It took a while to calm down enough to say something. If I would have known the content of the post, my brother certainly would not have been sitting here, and I would not have been showing him this site. My brother Chris is slightly retarded as you so callously put it. I did not even register the comment until it was too late, and he already had. So I got to explain all over again why people would use this term in such a show of mocking, disrespect, and general hate towards someone else…again. He said it was ok, just a little shocking…I know better. It really upset him.<br>
I have no qualm with the comment when it concerns me directly cause I know that you have absolutely no relevance to my life what so ever, and your opinion matters even less. You are as about as important to me directly as the rock on the ground. But when my brother is upset by something so thoughtlessly placed without any regard to him, or anyone else in his condition, I get irritated. Call me whatever the hell you want. I personally do not care, but think before tossing the words out on the screen. You have no idea the amount of other people you are effecting with a piss poor choice in your words.</p>

        <p>Words are just that, words. I have no hate for anything, but this was a cool thread until it turned to some philosophy about what’s safer…   Whatever the Titanic was clearly a bad idea.  Someone just had a very small thingaling.</p>

        <p>The titanic was a great idea, and a great improvement on cruise ships. The problem was that misunderstood the iceberg and got too close, causing the bottom of it to rip a hole in the ship.</p>
