You weren’t even helping him, you had no clue what his problem was either, and he said thanks when you did help him by telling him he needs to change the client to his no-ip (which isn’t true, the reason he was getting the error was because he wasn’t connecting locally). His problem was his client wasn’t being connected to localhost, if he gave his friends the client with the no-ip and connected locally on his own client it would work.</p>
