    <description>If you old guys out there ever heard of Shinscape,Shinscape V2,Shinscape Isle, Dispatcher beta, Dispatcher v1, Dispatcher v2 and Carom v1 then look out, because the last of my servers is here.

[size=17pt][b]Dispatcher LM[/b][/size]
This project is REALLY huge.I&#39;m using a pimpscape source , hoping that this will be a good server.
Along my way of coding Shinscape, it has been great to meet Harry, owner of Harryscape and Harryscape Ultimate.As shinscape v2 released, I came to know an experienced coder, Zandia.And then, I stopped going on Mopar for some time.Not long after I returned, Dispatcher beta was released. Skill capes, specials, almost everything that a player would request was there.And then Dispatcher v1.Coded from scratch using Pimpscape once again, really helped me a lot.And then came Dispatcher v2.It was then when I finally understanded voids.V2 was a really successful server.And not far back in time, Carom v1 was released. Coding this had gave me a really hard time, but it still helped me with my coding.And now, Dispatcher LM.

Dispatcher LM will be a huge hit (hoping so).What I accomplished, and the goals will be released soon.I&#39;ll make this server compatible with the 377 client.Sometimes it really makes me wonder.Does it take a good coder to code a server like Zdiddy?No, I guess not, it&#39;s all in your mind whether how hard you make it.
