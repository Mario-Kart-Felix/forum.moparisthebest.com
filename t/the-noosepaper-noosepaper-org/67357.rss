    <description>The Noosepaper is an independent media site run by the public that aims to provide un-biased news and a platform for debate that brings together people of all demographs. A large community and discussion forum complements the many correspondents it has around the world, with coverage of events from London to Washington and ever growing.

Through the forums anyone can submit his or her news to the front page and our live RSS feed. The Noosepaper ultimately aims to be used to voice the publics stories to potentially limitless audiences and create ever-growing community to analyze and debate the most important issues today.

We are a non-profit and independent NGO fueled by volunteers and public donations. We hope to collaberate with human rights groups around the world to help bring hope and peace to areas the most need it, and restore social balance where racism and prejudice are rife. As such each of its members must be dedicated, passionate and well read on the mission of their organization and the mean in which it will attempt to achieve it.

I have sent a PM to moparisthebest regarding TNP, but I don&#39;t see what the hell could be wrong with it, so I&#39;m posting it anyways.  ;)</description>
