    <title>Where to host a server other than at home=?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-to-host-a-server-other-than-at-home/57614</link>
    <description>Hi, 
I know that i could host my server on my pc, but it laggs, and i dont and cant leave it on the whole day long. So i need a Host, but have no idea where to find a free one. I dont care if its a webhost(what might not work)
Or another orginisation that does it, i just need a Host. Is there anyone who can help  me out there?
Please
Thanks</description>
