    <description>Buying myself a Christmas gift early...So why not another build...

My small worry is that I&#39;ve never picked out my own choice of parts before...Clients usually tell me what I get and I build.

http://secure.newegg.ca/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=15365031

My price-range was 1500(Pretty close).  Anybody have suggestions for better parts or Ideas of what I should get?


It&#39;s mostly for gaming if you never noticed.</description>

<p>The whole point is that just because something costs more, doesn’t mean that it is actually any better.  A $20 case WORKS.  Maybe you have to turn a screwdriver a few more times than if you spent $200 on the case, and if you don’t like using a screwdriver $180 worth, then maybe you should buy the $200 case.  I’ll pass though.</p>

<p>Use all that extra case money to get an SSD.  With that fast of a computer, a 7200rpm hard drive will definitely be the bottleneck.[/quote]</p>
<p>I somewhat like the two with the handles; I giggled seeing the first one having a floppy on it (lol).</p>
<p>I wish I knew someone around here with a ssd so I can atleast see the difference compared to a 7200; I rarely hear anything about them, is the speed really worth the extra 20/30 bucks?</p>
<p>Also I did some googling over my idea of a acrylic case and found this =&gt; <a href="http://www.xoxide.com/sunbeam-9bay-acrylic-clear.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.xoxide.com/sunbeam-9bay-acrylic-clear.html</a></p>
<p>Seeing the product images it’s quite exactly what I’m looking for; but still not sure about the site.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Ok I’ll take a look at cheaper cases.  My second thought for a case would be a clear out of acrylic or something similar.  Maybe that could be cheaper.</p>
<p>I’m still not sure about the SSD Harddrives.  I mostly use external drives so I wouldn’t be sure if it’s really worth the 30 seconds better write/read speed at the price it’s at.</p>

If you are already spending $1500 on a computer, you might as well go with liquid cooling.  I wouldn’t spend anywhere near $200 for a case, I just bought one to build a media center out of for $32 with free shipping.  I also wouldn’t spend that for a motherboard either, why are you getting a motherboard with a built-in video card and also buying a video card?  Just get one without a video card.</p>
<p>As to the video card, you could get 2 480s or 2 550s/560s for that price or less and probably better performance using them in SLI mode right?  I’m not positive, but I’m pretty sure you could.</p>
<p>Looks like a great deal on that monitor though! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>That hard drive looks extremely over priced, but then my brother did just tell me hard drive prices have doubled since the floods in Taiwan, so maybe that is why.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s pricey, but it will make a top-of-the-line machine for at least a few months. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Well after going through all of Newegg’s cases I chose that as I would be taking it to Lan party’s once in a while so I would want something small that I can change around very easily (Module Case).</p>
<p>I thought I picked a mother-board without a video-card; must have over-looked something…</p>
<p>I’m not planning on SlI’ing them yet as I wanna make sure I have the room after building before buying straight ahead.  Also that HD is one of one the cheapest on the site.[/quote]The i7 motherboards all have integrated gpu’s because the cpu has a graphics chipset.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:21, topic:421302”]If you are already spending $1500 on a computer, you might as well go with liquid cooling.  I wouldn’t spend anywhere near $200 for a case, I just bought one to build a media center out of for $32 with free shipping.  I also wouldn’t spend that for a motherboard either, why are you getting a motherboard with a built-in video card and also buying a video card?  Just get one without a video card.</p>
<p>As to the video card, you could get 2 480s or 2 550s/560s for that price or less and probably better performance using them in SLI mode right?  I’m not positive, but I’m pretty sure you could.</p>
<p>Looks like a great deal on that monitor though! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>That hard drive looks extremely over priced, but then my brother did just tell me hard drive prices have doubled since the floods in Taiwan, so maybe that is why.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s pricey, but it will make a top-of-the-line machine for at least a few months. ;)[/quote]</p>
<p>Well after going through all of Newegg’s cases I chose that as I would be taking it to Lan party’s once in a while so I would want something small that I can change around very easily (Module Case).</p>
<p>I thought I picked a mother-board without a video-card; must have over-looked something…</p>
<p>I’m not planning on SlI’ing them yet as I wanna make sure I have the room after building before buying straight ahead.  Also that HD is one of one the cheapest on the site.</p>

<p>With the Nh-D14 with both fans at 900rpm, at stock(3.7ghz/1.115 volts) my temps are never higher than 45c under load and oced to 4.5ghz with 1.300 volts and running prime95 for 20 minutes the temps were stable around 55-60c for all cores.

<p>After reading the reviews for it I decided to go with that.  I really wans’t sure if the D14 would fit.</p>
<p>Someone told me I should just go liquid cooling.</p>
