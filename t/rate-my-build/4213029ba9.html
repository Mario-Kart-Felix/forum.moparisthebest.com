My small worry is that I&amp;#39;ve never picked out my own choice of parts before...Clients usually tell me what I get and I build.

<p>As for the case I’m astonished you would spend $199.99 on a case and then limit yourself to a 19.1" lcd screen. We’ve been debating on irc and it seems it’s pretty split on expensive cases - whether they are worth it or not. I spent £20 on my case and it fulfills all my needs. I’d say go for a cheaper case but make sure you read some reviews on it before buying so you actually know what you are getting.</p>
<p>So yeah my advice is go for a cheaper case and get a nicer monitor. I think nearly everyone can agree having a good monitor is a way higher priority than having a good case.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ve never liked having a huge monitor for gaming…Takes longer to look around.  I got the idea of 19.1" as it’s what my school uses and I enjoy it.  Not to small, not to big.</p>
<p>[quote=“eczema3, post:38, topic:421302”]Cheaper != better deal</p>
<p>My first case was the shittiest, cheapest case I could find and it was absolutely horrendous, poor build quality, poor air flow, no space to put stuff and generally a massive eyesore. My current case cost me £55, it looks fucking brilliant, took me no time at all to install everything, tons of space inside… For the extra £30 i spent getting an extra case saved me so much work and hassle also who wants to take a dog ugly case to LAN?[/quote]</p>
<p>My first case was some Shoe box.  That was shitty I’ll tell ya lol.</p>
