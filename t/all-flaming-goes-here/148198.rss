    <title>All flaming goes here</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/all-flaming-goes-here/148198</link>
    <description>as suggested, I made a base for an updater, and added some transforms from my older updater, commited to the dev repository at that assembla place.

I also changed the names of some of those interface hooks, I once heard someone say they were going to flame anyone who came up with a rubbish name, so have a look and you can start your flaming... now. :|
I stuck to what I know about clients, like I dont know what Interface does, so i left alone

I also want to talk about some more details..

how do we give scripts methods they could use, like tile-to-minimap calculations and stuff, to use another word, accessor methods.
most other bots iv seen do it by putting them in a superclass of Script, ours could go something like Script -&gt; ScriptLib -&gt; RS2Script.
Or perhaps seperate them by subject Script -&gt; CalcLib -&gt; GroundLib -&gt; LoginLib -&gt; ObjectLib -&gt; RS2Script

we should start working on a security manager like the ones in firefox, we could just copy AppletSecurityManager, anyone got any other ideas, like an old bot no-one ever uses.

edit: also about random event handling, basicly... how to structure it?</description>

<p>We don’t add methods to the AccessorMethods interface, but we can add whatever we want to RS2AccessorMethods, as it is a class of our own implementation.  Basic methods should be in there (ie, methods that get anything needed from the client) and then we can write specific methods (chopTree() etc etc) in helper classes.</p>

              <p>All of the methods that script writers use should be in AccessorMethods, more specific methods the script writers can include themselves from specific utility classes semi-like SRL works.  The low-level never changing functions should be in AccessorMethods though.</p>
<p>We can copy AppletSecurityManager, but we need to put in some control structure that allows our calls to write to the disk etc to go through, but that the runescape applet sees just like the default AppletSecurityManager (think semaphore, not the guy ;))</p>
<p>Personally I think random event handling should be left up to the scripter, or at least written as another script to run in parallel with the rest of the script, much like SCAR handles them.  Suggestions?</p>
