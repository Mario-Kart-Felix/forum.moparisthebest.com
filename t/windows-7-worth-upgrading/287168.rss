    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/windows-7-worth-upgrading/287168</link>
    <description>I&#39;m thinking on upgrading to Windows 7 and I gotta ask this:

<p>Virtualbox allows you to do this as well, using a command like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename &lt;Absolute Path to output File&gt; -rawdisk /dev/sda -register</code></pre>

For running Games and programs that need lot of the computer you should install Vista/7 direct on the computer and not VMware/VirtualBox.[/quote]<br>
Sorry, Windows as a host is too much of a pain in the ass. Gentoo is very friendly. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">

<p>I am installing games into the virtual environment now, I will post here once I’ve tested its handling.</p>

No, but you will find them in the D:\programs files\ (On windows 7, C: will be the Windows 7 partion and Vista D:), some programs may not work like Adobe programs and your 3D programs that need serial codes.</p>

<p>Well considering the OS isn’t actually out yet (and won’t be until the Autumn, unless I’ve missed something?) so therefore I assume you’re speaking of upgrading to the <span class="bbcode-i">release candidate</span> in which case I have to say; Why? Its not like you’ll be able to have the operating system for longer than 8 or so months before your PC starts shutting down every two hours (as Microsoft have stated will happen on March 1st next year).</p>

I can see windows 7 staying around for a good 5 years, getting tuneups etc now and then.</p>
<p>Heh even the posibility of adding an ‘expansion pack’ to windows 7, calling it 7.5 or something.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 08, 2009, 02:23:56 pm[/size][hr]I’ve used XP for a long time, skipped vista, didn’t bother. But Windows 7 RTM (final) build release should be all over torrents by july 20th, ill grab me a copy then. Going to use Windows 7 since they have actually spent a lot of time on performance this time, instead of just beefing up visuals and adding useless junk to make things look cool, like they did from the XP to vista transition. Ill go 64bit this time, never been 64bit due to compatibility, however Windows 7 was programmed with 64bit in mind just as much as 32, as 64bit is becoming mainstream.</p>
<p>Along with my new build coming up soon, shits gonna fly</p>

              <p>Well considering the OS isn’t actually out yet (and won’t be until the Autumn, unless I’ve missed something?) so therefore I assume you’re speaking of upgrading to the <span class="bbcode-i">release candidate</span> in which case I have to say; Why? Its not like you’ll be able to have the operating system for longer than 8 or so months before your PC starts shutting down every two hours (as Microsoft have stated will happen on March 1st next year).</p>
<p>Go and get <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Fedora</a> if you want a new OS. Version 11 recently came out and its great tbh, if you’re interested you should read <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Overview" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> ;).</p>
