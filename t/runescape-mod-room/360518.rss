&lt;blockquote&gt;Jagex staff has refused to reveal the location of the Player Moderator room, and has refused to reveal where it is accessed by Player Moderators at. I&#39;ve edited a sentence containing information revealing this, as it is not officially recognized by Jagex, and it can lead to issues with players waiting near the location and harassing Player Moderators.

<p>I just found out while doing a little research on the RuneScape mods and stumbled across some rumours about a mod room where they have all there meetings and what not. So I looked it up on youtube and found the video above recorded by a real p mod</p>
<blockquote>Jagex staff has refused to reveal the location of the Player Moderator room, and has refused to reveal where it is accessed by Player Moderators at. I've edited a sentence containing information revealing this, as it is not officially recognized by Jagex, and it can lead to issues with players waiting near the location and harassing Player Moderators.
