    <title>718 Help Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-help-questions/544142</link>
    <description>Hey guys, just a quick list of problems I can&#39;t solve on my own... so hopefully someone will be kind enough to assist me.

1. Mid-way through coding Bandit Camp on my Rome-based project, I noticed that my Money Pouch and XP Counter stopped working. Not the functions themselves, but the buttons no longer bring up the pouch or the xp interface. I can&#39;t right-click withdraw any money from the pouch but I can deposit money into it. Also money is removed from it when buying things without gold being in my inventory. 

2. There are no guides for making quests in 718. I assume it works something like the beginning tutorial of Rome in which the progress is documented by stages.. but im not good enough with java to do it myself yet. I need some help with this.

3. I have been looking for an updated NPC definitions dump, because the one I have is missing over 1000 NPCS, including Astea Frostweb and the Ice Queen which I have used as bosses on my server. I need their attack/death animations as well as Ice Demons.

4. I attempted to take pieces of code from other parts of the server to make item effects such as slayer helmet and spirit shield, but I failed horribly. How would I go about adding item effects like these?

5. As many of you know there is an ultra annoying bug with the Matrix bank and equipment viewer interfaces conflicting. Has a fix for this been found yet? I have searched for 3 days and have not found a single piece of information on this. 


This is what i&#39;ve gathered after 8 days of working on my project. 

DISCLAIMER: I am not asking to be spoonfed information. I don&#39;t want 2 pages of code that I just need to copy and paste. I am asking for help, guidance, training wheels so to speak. I want to learn how to do these things so I can do them on my own in the future. 

Thank you</description>
