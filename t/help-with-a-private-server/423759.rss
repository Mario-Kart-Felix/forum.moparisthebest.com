    <title>Help with a private server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-a-private-server/423759</link>
    <description>this isnt about programming a server or anything. but i quit rsps&#39;s about 1 year ago and i used to play on a really good server. i cant remember the name so i will describe it and will someone try to tell me the name. someones gotta play it.

i remember u would spawn in varrock then u could thieve from either stalls or people (cant remember which) and u wld get p-hats or tokens for the well or cannon shots for the multi cannon. there was a well where youd drop int okens and get like santa armour or jester outfits. u cld get a multi cannon easily at the blacksmith in varrack by the middle. you could go to a spot where the helldogs shld be and kill corp. tell me the name please. oh and there was alot of customs.</description>
