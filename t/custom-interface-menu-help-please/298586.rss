    <title>Custom Interface Menu Help Please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-interface-menu-help-please/298586</link>
    <description>Alright, well I edited a code a got for a menu and it opens up that one scroll with the scroll bar, I&#39;m trying to change it to something different, I got the code for a stone menu thing, I changed the code for what interface opens up when you do the command to open that menu from:

[code]showInterface(8134);[/code]

to:

[code]showInterface(11104);[/code]

When I run my server the command opens up the 11104 interface, but none of the text that is supposed to be shown is not shown on the interface, but it was shown on the 8134 interface. Anyone know what I&#39;m doing wrong?</description>
