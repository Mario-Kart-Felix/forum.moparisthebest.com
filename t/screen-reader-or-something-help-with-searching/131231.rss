    <description>Well i have an email account at www.mail.com (it was my first ever email account, and the website used to be called www.email.com) anyways about half a year ago that website offered to have your mail read by one of four voices (e.g. like microsoft sam), they had:
English accent
American accent
French accent
and german accent. (all women btw)

Well recently i&#39;ve come back to mail.com to have my mail read (and basically make it say stupid stuff) but they don&#39;t offer that anymore. I know that there is an actual site to have this done without it being an addon to an email client so i was wondering if someone could find it (yes i have search with google). I just cant think of anything to type into google.


Thanks.</description>
