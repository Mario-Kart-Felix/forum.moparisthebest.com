    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-post-a-vps-server-on-moparscape-server-status/321908</link>
    <description>[b]Hello,
if got a realy big problem!
I try to get moparscape client on my vps.
But it&#39;s to slow to put the client on. I need it to login with the username and id i get when i need to aprove my server.
And i must do that on the vps. So is there another way to get my server on moparscape server status?[/b]

Welcome jennipher11!
Further Action Required, Read:
New server Xeonscape Dodian reborn succesfully entered, however it will not show up on the list until it has been verified and approved.
Your server will now be checked by logging into it with the following credentials:
Username: DIjr
Password: Tl2NJB
to make sure it is online, and if successful, it will be posted.
You must register this username and password for me on your server and allow it to be logged into from the IP 69.39.224.55
The server will be deleted from the queue if not verified and logged into within 24 hours of posting.[/code]

69.39.224.55 this is not my vps ip adress.
My vps adress is: 64.186.132.131</description>
