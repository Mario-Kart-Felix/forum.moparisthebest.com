    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-just-starting-out-guys-need-a-hand/295364</link>
    <description>ok guys i dont really know where to post this, but ill just post it here for now.

ok well i really want to get back into doing private servers again, only problem is, ive lost all the little knowledge i had of them, i dont know whats a good pk source to start from, what client to use, how to change the ip to mine etc, so yes, thats basically the 3 things i&#39;m asking.

1. What is a good pk server to start from? (I want my server to be a pk one)
2. What client should i use? links for this and previous question! :D
3. How do i change the ip of a client to mine, where do i find GUI.java etc..

thanks!
please dont flame for my noobiness lol i know i&#39;m very stupid with servers but hopefully i can learn fast,as  i&#39;m recovering from spinal surgery.

thanks again</description>

I suggest you download a basic source from the downloads section and just read some tutorials.</p>
