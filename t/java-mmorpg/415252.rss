              <p>A suggestion of myn (as I did this even) is to get your general ideas done. Like on a notepad, plan out how you want everything to interact. Creating an MORPG (the first M doesn’t come unless it gets vast amount of players imo). How will the server work, will there be multiple servers? Myn works like so (even for the chatroom I am rebuilding).<br>
1 Main server - This server handles all incoming connections, getting the version of the client (to check for an update), and the username &amp; password to verify.<br>
1 Update server - If the Main server found that there is an update to be needed, the update server will get the MD5 of the files, check with the client in its cache, and send the new file if one is required.<br>
2 Game servers - If the Main server confirmed the players credentials were correct, it would forward the connection to here. This is where all of the game is handled etc.</p>
<p>The planning is more or less, how will this all be done and work. Are you going to do an update server, main server, or just 1 server that does this all. The update server is only required when there are files being saved on the clients computer. The next step I took is to plan out your game. Since it is an RPG, you will need some kind of adventurous feel to the game. Maybe get some color coded sticky notes (this is what professional companies sometimes do) for each thing. Animations, items, everything will need to be planned out. There is no “how do I start” when creating a game. Its like being 5 years old and looking at a huge hamburger. The first thought in your mind may be “where do I start?!?!”. Just take steps to get things done. None of this will be simple.</p>
<p>As mentioned though, start with 2d before moving on to 3d.</p>
