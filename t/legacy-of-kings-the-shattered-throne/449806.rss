This project started my junior year of high school and i am in the summer before college.
I do not know where to go with this and i was hoping to show the community and get some feed back if i should go ahead with it or scrap it and move on.

Story short version- 

Two brothers, one has the power the other rebels and wants to take it, you choice to either align with the royals or the rebels and that will determine quests, friends and story line, as of right now you just get a title for picking a side :P.
The game is click and wait for now, you do have a map and there are 4 directional buttons for movement, there are potions, food, skills- fishing, lumber jacking, and construction ( all function but not finished )

You have two resources as of right now, health and mana, both recovered through potions and food, lost through combat.

I wrote a chat system for the game, it is separate from the game so if you do not wish to chat you do not have to, it is part of the game ui and is unlocked by clicking a enter chat button.

You collect gold from quests and killing, it will be used for auction houses and shops later on.

You get xp and level from quests and killing 

The UI is set up like a &quot;story book&quot; because you are creating your own story.

Here is a link to the games Facebook page, it has pictures and more information on the game.
