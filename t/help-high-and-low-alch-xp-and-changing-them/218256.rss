    <title>[Help] High and Low alch xp and changing them</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-high-and-low-alch-xp-and-changing-them/218256</link>
    <description>Hey currently my high and low alchs give about 20 - 80k xp depending on what your mage level is and I really want to change that. I would rather have them give the same ammount the whole time. I know its in my client.java but I cant find it. And I used a calculator and found out how much xp it gave me once but that number wasnt in there. Any help in what to look for or what to do?</description>
