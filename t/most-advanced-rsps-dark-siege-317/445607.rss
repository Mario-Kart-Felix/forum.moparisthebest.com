    <title>MOST ADVANCED RSPS (Dark Siege) 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/most-advanced-rsps-dark-siege-317/445607</link>
    <description>Project Dark Siege Status: Under Development

Introduction &amp; Features:

In 2010 Dark Siege was the name of an advanced mmorpg which was meant to be released in 2013, however after dicsussing the payments with financial investors we realised that we couldnt accomplish anything as great as DS with no money and it would be impossible to save up half a million dollars to develop and publish it.

After the incident the DS team split up, now i want to create a new 317 rsps which includes everything you will find in runescape and more, i will be adding some MINOR content from the old Dark Siege project. There will be 4-5 Developers working on this project including a financial team which has put up around $2000 dollars which will be used to improvise and modify dark siege so we can introduce new content which doesnt even exist in the runscape world.

Fantastic economy, 100% uptime and 0 lag !

Duel Arena, Castle Wars, Soul Wars, Bounty hunter, Clan Chat, All Bosses (Perfected), Loot Share, Pest Control, Dungeoneering &amp; Many More Updated Soon 

Trained Skills:

- Magic:

All modern magic spells e.g {Storm of armadyl etc...}

- Attack, Defence, Strength

There would be perfect pking including perfected item stats and perfectly timed attack speeds. All modern weaponry and armour would be included e.g {Torva, Pernix, Zaryte Bow, Virtus etc..}

- Ranged

All range items will be added, we will also try and create new armour and a new bow for you guys.

- Prayer, Fire Making and all the other Skills

We will be adding all the skills including dungeoneering to 120. All skill capes will be added including completionist cape and completionist cape (T)

We will add dungeoneering items such as {Primal, Promethium, Celestial}

Extra Information

I will be spending a lot of money on this server, we will be perfecting the &quot;combat system&quot;, &quot;All Minigames&quot;, &quot;All boses and rewards&quot;.
I will also make a poll about adding the grand exchange.

We will add some ideas that we wanted to add into dark siege. {No further explanation} 

There will be a team working on every aspect of the server. I will also add a group who will work on the forums. 
In-Game staff (etc). 

We will be adding holiday events and server events. Also regular updates introducing new content to all the players

Many new content will be introduced after the first release ! Get ready for a new RSPS expirence !
