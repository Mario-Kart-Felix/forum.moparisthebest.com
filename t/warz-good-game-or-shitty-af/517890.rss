    <title>WarZ Good game or Shitty af</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/warz-good-game-or-shitty-af/517890</link>
    <description>Personally i got bored of the game after 3 hours of play
Takes 1 hour for a character to be revived again So i basicly had to keep making new characters.
Zombies hitting you threw walls? and fences?
And other shit
Overall shitty game would not play it again lmao 
but tell me what you think of it.
Oh yea forgot to mention don&#39;t get me started on the hackers -_-...
I found 1 gun and that was a pistol Lmao..
I think DayZ is way funner than this game.. and thats a mod...
Aswell as the hackers? some of them give benifits like when they make everyone have dsw&#39;s..
But overall more hackers in WarZ then DayZ because WarZ will not listen to any of the customers and buy anti cheat software for the game!
