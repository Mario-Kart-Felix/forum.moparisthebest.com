    <title>How much would this pc cost me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-much-would-this-pc-cost-me/275311</link>
    <description>Well, this year I wanted to build my own pc, but I need it PURELY for gaming, since I already have a laptop for school, but I wanted top specs. for example, 


[ul][li]Quad core Intel[/li]
[li]Latest nvidia geforce[/li]
[li]8gb ram[/li]
[li]500gb hard drive[/li]
[li]a customisable box[/li]
[li]24&quot; monitor[/li][/ul]


I was wondering how much something like that would cost? and where to buy it from.

Thanks</description>

the top i7 is not worth the extra cash you are better off with a lower clock speed one and try to overclock it if you want that extra speed that bad its still a good CPU. i think the bus speed and cache are bigger on the top end i7 as well[/quote]<br>
Nope, they’re the same (at least the cache). Lower-end i7 is best bang for one’s buck.</p>
