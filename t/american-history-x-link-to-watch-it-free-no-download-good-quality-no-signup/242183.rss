    <description>Plot:

Derek Vinyard returns from prison to find his younger brother, Danny, caught in the same web of racism and hatred that landed him in prison. After Derek&#39;s father is killed in the line of duty by a minority, Derek&#39;s view of mankind is altered, but while in prison, he discovers that there is good and bad in every race. The task before him now is to convince Danny of his newfound enlightenment.  Written by Robin {soonerzs@yahoo.com}

This flashback-laden film delves into the world of a former neo-NAZI and shows how his hatred spawned itself in his younger brother. After committing a brutal assault and Derek is sent to prison. There he sees that all humans have potential and all life should be respected. His life turned around and back out on the streets he tries to cure his brother of the same disease that took him. Written by FMJ_Joker

A brutal Neo Nazi skinhead named Derek Vinyard is tried and sent to prison for three years for the murder of two black guys who tried to steal his truck. When he returns from prison reformed, his younger brother Daniel Vinyard who idolizes him is on the brink of becoming a Neo Nazi himself. Derek must save his younger brother from a similar fate.
