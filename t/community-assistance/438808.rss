    <description>Hey guys. I&#39;m currently working on the development of a private server called Embattled (check it out in development section). The main characteristic of Embattled is its unique gameplay features and ideas.

This leads to the very reason for making this topic. In an attempt to extend the originality of Embattled further than it is already, new interfaces are being made for the features  being added, example lockpicking. Many have already acknowledged the current level of originality of Embattled, however it is my intention to take it to the next level. This includes completely new skills, and remakes of existing skills. These will be elaborated on further in the topic. The reactions from friends has been varied, so I&#39;d like a general community opinion on regards to the features I am going to add. So please read on and post your honest opinions.

Please  note: These features will require their own item and object models, however if they don&#39;t look exceptional they will not be added. So please avoid posts such as, if you can get the models right it will  be good. I know this. The skills are as follows.

Mining
Description: Ability to gather ore and gems from respective rocks.
Features: -There will only be one type of picaxe, however it will degrade over time. 
-Instead of walking into an area and there being many rocks, mining deposits will be spread throughout the map. Higher rocks being in higher level areas.
-The types of rocks will be different to Runescape.

Skinning
Description: Gathering resources from animals such as rats, bears, scorpions, wolves.
Features: -Every animal will drop a carcass, which if activated will add items that correspond to that animal. Example wolf pelt, bones, wolf fang. Whether you can skin the carcass for its items depends on skinning level.

Herblore
Description: Ability to gather herbs from plant objects.
Features: -Similar to mining skill.

Fishing
Description: gathering fish from fishing spots.
Features: -similar to existing fishing. 

Woodcutting
Description: Gathering wood from trees.
Features: -Similar to existing.

Smithing
Description: Creating bars, armour, weapons and jewellery from ores.
Features:-Similar to existing.

Crafting
Description: Creating light armour from animal pelts, bows from wood, etc.
Features:-New armour will be integrated for rangers, wolf armour, bear armour, leather. 

Alchemy
Description: Creating potions from carcass items and herblore items.
Features: -All potions will be one dose. New potions will be integrated.
-Players will use alchemy labs to create potions.

Cooking
Description: Cooking raw items.
Features: -Similar to existing cooking.

Enchanting
-Description: Ability to enchant basic armour pieces and weapons to add bonuses.
Features: -Enchanted armour will look slightly different to its base armour. For example guthix, zamorak, are based off rune armour. Likewise with weapons.
-Soul ingots are used to enchant items.

All skills will have different interfaces and models.
[end of skills]


Features

Collecting Souls: All enemies that are killed will release souls. To collect souls you must be wearing a high enough level ring. An emerald ring is the first level ring, it allows players to collect souls from level 20 monsters and below. Sapphire rings allow players to collect souls from monsters level 40 and below. Etc. Higher level enemies release more souls. A soul container must also be present to collect souls. Souls are then morphed into soul ingots. Which can be traded. Ingots are used for enchanting and magic as a replacement for runes.

[end of features]


This is all completely programmable. I have already began on handlers for these skills. I&#39;m just waiting on models and interfaces by developers.

I was just wondering what you guys think about these ideas and features in a private server? Is it time for a change? Do players only want to play generic runescape server? Would it be popular? 

All comments are appreciated. Keep it friendly but honest.

Thank you. All comments are appreciated. :)</description>

              <p>I personally have always wanted to “change” a runescape server, I have actually been working on one(not a lot unfortunately as I have a server to run), but you posting this has made me want to go back into it so thank you(I hope you don’t think that I am stealing your idea, it has been an idea of mine for a very long time. Not the same concepts but similar game play…and no i am not going to copy what you have done or anything haha)</p>
<p>But I think your’s would come out better anyways as I am not the best programmer(I have only begun seeing as runescape sources give you so much help with copy and pasting and not actually programming it yourself)</p>
<p>Anyways as always(and I have said it like 3 times)</p>

              <p>Thank you all for the opinions. I think I will take the chance. I know that it is far-fetched, but I don’t think I would be completely happy with it unless I integrated some of the above features. If implemented properly, I am hoping they retain their feel with the rest of the game and don’t feel alienated. However, that is what beta testing is for, so I know that players are satisfied with the content before its release. The reason for making it Runescape-based is that I quite like the simplicity of Runescape gameplay. And I think players are more likely to give it a shot because of this. Yes it would be more fitting to emulate another game for these features, however I have always been curious in regards to transforming a Runescape server.</p>
<p>In regards to the models, interfaces, and animations, these are currently being worked on by a small development one-by-one. Due to the fact that Embattled is not utilizing all of the map, it certainly narrows the models that are required down. Many of the interfaces are very similar and therefore not a HUGE task to redo. Animations are yet to be explored. But we are starting small, conducting feasibility tests and designing/replacing more and more of the cache. We are starting small and expanding.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for all the opinions and views. More are definitely welcome.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Well maybe they still want the same game frame and character as runescape, but different skills then runescape <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

In regards to your ideas, you have to realize that this is a RuneScape private server and as such you will get a lot of negative responses in regards to your remixes on these critical parts of the game. You have two options:</p>
<p>Create a server you are proud of and are happy to call your own, but face it that not everyone will enjoy your server and popularity <span class="bbcode-i">may</span> suffer because of that.</p>
<p>Create a server that caters to the general every-day gamers needs and recreate what has been done thousands of times before you. This will feature a massive block on your creative side though.</p>
<p>I personally loved your ideas, although I don’t think it would flow that well with the way RuneScape is created now. I think you may want to expand to a different game for most of these ideas because “collecting souls” would never, in my opinion, fit into the realm of RuneScape as it is today.<br>
[/quote]<br>
This isn’t suppose to fit the realm of Runescape, this is something different.<br>
I think people want a new taste of games, the same usual boring stuff in a server isn’t cutting it anymore. People want new ideas because they’re tired of the same shit.[/quote]</p>
<p>Define realm: A kingdom: “the peers of the realm”.</p>
<p>Thus meaning, the maps, the graphics, the characters, all models, the entire design behind RuneScape would have to be redone in my opinion. At which point, it’s not a RuneScape private server. RuneScape will never be able to handle certain concepts that some games (World of Warcraft, Runes of Magic, etc) strive off of. Namely Dungeoneering, that doesn’t fit RuneScape what-so-ever. That was JaGex’s attempt to expand outwards and I think they did a horrible job on doing so. Summoning too, to a certain extent was added horrendously, in my opinion. The way they have the game set-up, it’s extremely limited on what you can / cannot add without it feeling disconnected from the rest of the game.</p>
<p>I think if he wanted to do this successfully a better take would be to emulate another game and add aspects from RuneScape into that. For the simple fact that you cannot immerse yourself into RuneScape. It will remain as a point-and-click browser based game until someone takes the time to overhaul it completely, which is more work than its worth.</p>

<p>Very true…I am tired of seeing a 562 server(for example) and all you get is the same server leeched over and over and over again.</p>
<p>I don’t want that to be the fate of this server so I hope he never gets tired of it and releases it lol.<br>
I think this will be a huge success if done properly.</p>
<p>Also with the model thing I got my answer when I looked at the development thread(I saw this first) the models of Runescape were still there just a couple different things =]</p>
<p>It would still be cool to change the current buildings and trees, etc haha</p>

              <p>Well to start I would say I don’t think this is suppose to be in the help section lol <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
I think its suppose to be in Server Development section, but no big deal.</p>
<p>I kind of like your idea as I have always wanted to do something like that myself…sure normal private servers are fun(whether is an economy server or a pking server,spawning server etc…), but stuff like this is more creative and new so I would assume it would become popular if people gave it a try.</p>
<p>You would really have to be good at programming for it though and you would need to test it to make sure the exp rates are fair, all the model names are right…no bugs in the skills and yeah.(Even though you said don’t post things such as:“If you can get the models right it will be good.” See I read :P)</p>
<p>I would help you out if you want I think this would be cool to code =]</p>
<p>Also do you plan on changing like every model in runescape?</p>
<p>I would really like to see this project get done ^^</p>

              <p>Hey guys. I’m currently working on the development of a private server called Embattled (check it out in development section). The main characteristic of Embattled is its unique gameplay features and ideas.</p>
<p>This leads to the very reason for making this topic. In an attempt to extend the originality of Embattled further than it is already, new interfaces are being made for the features  being added, example lockpicking. Many have already acknowledged the current level of originality of Embattled, however it is my intention to take it to the next level. This includes completely new skills, and remakes of existing skills. These will be elaborated on further in the topic. The reactions from friends has been varied, so I’d like a general community opinion on regards to the features I am going to add. So please read on and post your honest opinions.</p>
<p>Please  note: These features will require their own item and object models, however if they don’t look exceptional they will not be added. So please avoid posts such as, if you can get the models right it will  be good. I know this. The skills are as follows.</p>
<p>Mining<br>
Description: Ability to gather ore and gems from respective rocks.<br>
Features: -There will only be one type of picaxe, however it will degrade over time.<br>
-Instead of walking into an area and there being many rocks, mining deposits will be spread throughout the map. Higher rocks being in higher level areas.<br>
-The types of rocks will be different to Runescape.</p>
<p>Skinning<br>
Description: Gathering resources from animals such as rats, bears, scorpions, wolves.<br>
Features: -Every animal will drop a carcass, which if activated will add items that correspond to that animal. Example wolf pelt, bones, wolf fang. Whether you can skin the carcass for its items depends on skinning level.</p>
<p>Herblore<br>
Description: Ability to gather herbs from plant objects.<br>
Features: -Similar to mining skill.</p>
<p>Fishing<br>
Description: gathering fish from fishing spots.<br>
Features: -similar to existing fishing.</p>
<p>Woodcutting<br>
Description: Gathering wood from trees.<br>
Features: -Similar to existing.</p>
<p>Smithing<br>
Description: Creating bars, armour, weapons and jewellery from ores.<br>
Features:-Similar to existing.</p>
<p>Crafting<br>
Description: Creating light armour from animal pelts, bows from wood, etc.<br>
Features:-New armour will be integrated for rangers, wolf armour, bear armour, leather.</p>
<p>Alchemy<br>
Description: Creating potions from carcass items and herblore items.<br>
Features: -All potions will be one dose. New potions will be integrated.<br>
-Players will use alchemy labs to create potions.</p>
<p>Cooking<br>
Description: Cooking raw items.<br>
Features: -Similar to existing cooking.</p>
<p>Enchanting<br>
-Description: Ability to enchant basic armour pieces and weapons to add bonuses.<br>
Features: -Enchanted armour will look slightly different to its base armour. For example guthix, zamorak, are based off rune armour. Likewise with weapons.<br>
-Soul ingots are used to enchant items.</p>
<p>All skills will have different interfaces and models.<br>
[end of skills]</p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>Collecting Souls: All enemies that are killed will release souls. To collect souls you must be wearing a high enough level ring. An emerald ring is the first level ring, it allows players to collect souls from level 20 monsters and below. Sapphire rings allow players to collect souls from monsters level 40 and below. Etc. Higher level enemies release more souls. A soul container must also be present to collect souls. Souls are then morphed into soul ingots. Which can be traded. Ingots are used for enchanting and magic as a replacement for runes.</p>
<p>[end of features]</p>
<p>This is all completely programmable. I have already began on handlers for these skills. I’m just waiting on models and interfaces by developers.</p>
<p>I was just wondering what you guys think about these ideas and features in a private server? Is it time for a change? Do players only want to play generic runescape server? Would it be popular?</p>
<p>All comments are appreciated. Keep it friendly but honest.</p>
<p>Thank you. All comments are appreciated. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
