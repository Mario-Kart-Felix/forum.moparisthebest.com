[center]Java[tm] Technology Products Download Page[/center]

[center]Sun is providing the products available as a courtesy to developers for problem resolution. The products available here have completed the Sun EOL process and are no longer supported under standard support contracts. These products are down-revision products that may have various bugs, Y2000, and possibly security issues associated with them. Sun in no way recommends these products be used in a live, production environment. Any use of product on this page is at the sole discretion of the developer and Sun assumes no responsiblity for any resulting problems. [/center]

         I have discovered a section of &quot;www.java.com&quot; where you can download older versions. This will stop the spamming when someone posts about getting JDK5.0 or JDK6.0. You can use this page to download them and other products of further understanding. Below, I have put together a preview of what is on the page and what you can do. This page is very helpful and useful in the future.

So this is how the page looks. Now if you have noticed I highlighted some important and most RuneScape Private Server related topics. I will explain what each section is about.

Red: Your most famous, JDK and JRE Version 6. In the drop down menu, it will list the different updates it comes with. So it is very up to date. This is the most famous section. Therse versions arent that hard to get.

Green: Remember when we had JDK and JRE Version 5? That was around last year! Well anyway, here are your Version 5 with all the updates.

Purple and Black: These are you really old versions of Java. Now these versions [b]will not[/b] work with a private server. These versions are too old to work with and cannot be dealt with. Of course you can use them for other files and programs if needed or for testing. This knowledge of versions are much for further understanding of others.

Well, there you have it! Now whenever you need to download any version or other programs from Java, you know where to find them.
