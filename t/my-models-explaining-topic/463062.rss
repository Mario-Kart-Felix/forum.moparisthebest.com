    <title>My Models [ Explaining Topic ]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-models-explaining-topic/463062</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I know that some of you would like to see my models, and the progress that I am making on them.
But I have been informed by Frell that my models are too High of a Resolution to be posted in the RS Models section, so if you would like to view my models, please take a look at the Graphics section.
I will be posting all my Non-RS Client (Higher then 2k Poly) models there from now on.

Hoping that you will have a blast when overviewing my models ;)
And maybe learn something from them, like a clean topology.

Yours truly,

A.C.F.  :)</description>

              <p>Haha yeah, some might think that.<br>
But looking at how this is a RuneScape section for models that go into a client, I can see why I need to post them to the graphics section.<br>
Not only because my models are too good for y’all scumbags (jk) they also wouldn’t ever fit into a Rs client.</p>
