    <title>Car ploughs into Queen&#39;s Day parade - two killed, twelve wounded</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;A car ploughed into a crowd of people in Apeldoorn today during an official visit there by the Dutch royal family. Two people were killed and twelve wounded. All Queen&#39;s Day festivities have been cancelled. (+ video)

An unidentified man in a black Suzuki Swift plowed into a crowd of onlookers in Apeldoorn today during a visit to the city by the Dutch royal family on the occasion of Queen&#39;s Day. Eyewitnesses, including NRC Handelsblad photographer Merlin Daleman said the driver &quot;clearly intended&quot; to ram the bus carrying the royal family on its way to the royal palace &#39;t Loo. 

Fourteen people were wounded, including the driver. He and two others are reportedly in serious condition. According to public broadcaster NOS, two people have been killed. 

Eyewitnesses say the black Suzuki crashed through the crowd barriers at the Jachtlaan at 11.50 a.m. with a speed of about 80 kilometres per hour. He was headed in the direction of the open bus carrying the royal family, which had just turned onto the Loolaan. The car came to a stop when it hit a monument on the corner of the Loolaan. Crown prince Willem Alexander and princess Máxima immediately jumped up and covered their mouths in consternation. 

According to eyewitnesses, the black Suzuki had been seen earlier in the day on the Amerfoortsesteenweg. &quot;The car was stopped by police,&quot; an eyewitness told Radio 1 news. &quot;He turned onto a side street and took off at high speed... The driver was a 25 or 26-year old man.&quot; Other eyewitnesses added that the man was white. 

After it crashed, firefighters had to use electric saws to get the drive out of the car. Around 12.17 p.m. he was carried into an ambulance. His body was not covered with a white sheet, which implies that he was still alive at the time. 

The bus carrying the royal family continued to the royal palace &#39;t Loo in Apeldoorn. The government information service RVD and the mayor of Apeldoorn later announced that all festivities for Queen&#39;s Day were cancelled. 

Queen&#39;s Day is the commemoration of the birthday of queen Juliana (1909-2004). Over the years it has grown into a nationwide celebration of Dutchness and togetherness, attracting crowds of up to 800,000 people in Amsterdam alone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wow. I was watching tv during lunch, and it was on the news, after that I talked to a friend who sent me [url=http://www.rtl.nl/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/miMedia/2009/week18/Thu12.ruwbeeld_apeldoorn.xml]this[/url].
This is really sickening, especially considering how this year&#39;s queen&#39;s day should&#39;ve been a special one, considering it was 100 years ago that queen juliana was born.</description>

              <p>This was one sickening thing!</p>
<p>What started as a very great queensday, a day with joy and not caring for anything turned out into a tragic. I was watching the live footage on tv at work, and what I saw at that moment… People fyling in the air, even a 9 year old child that got plown into th air and ragdolled over the road… I will not remember those images ever again!</p>
<p>Queensday will never be the same again in years for me.</p>
<p>R.I.P to the 6 deceased people (7 people died, but the seventh person is the murderer and he doesn’t deserves any respect at all!).</p>
<p>The problem now is, moronic people are pulling a hunt on black Suzuki Swifts, reports from al over the country say that owners of black Suzuki swifts get aggresive reactions. Even damaged Swifts are being reported. Thats just sad, I mean it could’ve been any car.</p>

<p>They have jobs too. IIRC only the Queen receives money from the state, and maybe the Crown Prince. But all the other princes and princesses have jobs. The palaces need money for upkeep anyways, as they are historical buildings which are protected by law.</p>

              <blockquote>A car ploughed into a crowd of people in Apeldoorn today during an official visit there by the Dutch royal family. Two people were killed and twelve wounded. All Queen's Day festivities have been cancelled. (+ video)
<p>An unidentified man in a black Suzuki Swift plowed into a crowd of onlookers in Apeldoorn today during a visit to the city by the Dutch royal family on the occasion of Queen’s Day. Eyewitnesses, including NRC Handelsblad photographer Merlin Daleman said the driver “clearly intended” to ram the bus carrying the royal family on its way to the royal palace 't Loo.</p>
<p>Fourteen people were wounded, including the driver. He and two others are reportedly in serious condition. According to public broadcaster NOS, two people have been killed.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses say the black Suzuki crashed through the crowd barriers at the Jachtlaan at 11.50 a.m. with a speed of about 80 kilometres per hour. He was headed in the direction of the open bus carrying the royal family, which had just turned onto the Loolaan. The car came to a stop when it hit a monument on the corner of the Loolaan. Crown prince Willem Alexander and princess Máxima immediately jumped up and covered their mouths in consternation.</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses, the black Suzuki had been seen earlier in the day on the Amerfoortsesteenweg. “The car was stopped by police,” an eyewitness told Radio 1 news. “He turned onto a side street and took off at high speed… The driver was a 25 or 26-year old man.” Other eyewitnesses added that the man was white.</p>
<p>After it crashed, firefighters had to use electric saws to get the drive out of the car. Around 12.17 p.m. he was carried into an ambulance. His body was not covered with a white sheet, which implies that he was still alive at the time.</p>
<p>The bus carrying the royal family continued to the royal palace 't Loo in Apeldoorn. The government information service RVD and the mayor of Apeldoorn later announced that all festivities for Queen’s Day were cancelled.</p>
<p>Queen’s Day is the commemoration of the birthday of queen Juliana (1909-2004). Over the years it has grown into a nationwide celebration of Dutchness and togetherness, attracting crowds of up to 800,000 people in Amsterdam alone.</p>

<p>Wow. I was watching tv during lunch, and it was on the news, after that I talked to a friend who sent me <a href="http://www.rtl.nl/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/miMedia/2009/week18/Thu12.ruwbeeld_apeldoorn.xml" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>.<br>
This is really sickening, especially considering how this year’s queen’s day should’ve been a special one, considering it was 100 years ago that queen juliana was born.</p>
