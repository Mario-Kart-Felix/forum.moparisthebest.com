              <p>I am a beginning coder and therefore don’t know the code to help you, but i do understand the concept, which could possibly help you be able to find what you are looking for be it on a forum or somewhere in your source already.<br>
For the book idea you have, you would click read. Now in the code it would have something about that option opening an interface, in which you would put the desired text.</p>
<p>I know this isn’t alot to go on and probably deserves a -1, but i hope it helps you in some way, shape, or form.</p>
