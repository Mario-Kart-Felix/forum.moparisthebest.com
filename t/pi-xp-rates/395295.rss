    <description>Hey guys, I tryed to Bump my XP rates up a little higher but no matter what i try to do the xp stays the same :S Does anyone have any idea how to properly do it? i just went into config.java and changed the multiplyers, the fishing seems to be a bit screwed also every lobster u catch you only get 700 xp :S

Source: Hybrid PVP V3
And i have no compiling errors

EDIT: Never mind fixed it the config xp multipliers weren&#39;t coded into the skills :P :)</description>
