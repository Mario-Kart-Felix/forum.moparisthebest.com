    <title>Could of quick questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/could-of-quick-questions/534884</link>
    <description>Yo guys, I am fairly new here and I do have a couple of questions regarding my server development. These maybe fairly simple questions with really quick solutions but I have looked around on here and multiple sites and I am yet to find a solution. Now baring in mind that I have never developed a RSPS before and I am fairly new to JAVA. I do have some coding history with C++, VB and C#.

Here are some details about my Source and Client.
317 Delta source/clean
317 Delta client/clean

First question:
How do I go about adding in the ::item command?

Second question:
How do I go about adding in yell tags. I have already got ::yell working but for some reason I cannot get the tags to work. I have followed various tutorials but I am simply not getting any result from it.

Anyway guys, time to wrap this up.
Thanks for reading, looking forward to seeing your replies.</description>

Not really recommended to use delta as it’s fairly outdated, but your choice.<br>

<p>Project Insanity is easy to understand but you need to find one that has all dupes patches and clean so you can start from scratch. Ones with load of content usually end up in being a dumpster of problems.</p>
