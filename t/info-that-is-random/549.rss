    <title>Info that is... random?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/info-that-is-random/549</link>
    <description>In my mind and the mind of many cheaters, I am the furthest along in cheating for Runescape 2. My knowledge is the most vast there is for now. I&#39;m your most valuable resource as a community. I&#39;d use my knowledge to your benefit... If I say something other than flamage, you should probably listen. (yeah I can be a dick at times, can&#39;t we all? lol) Semaphore was making option-pushing bots when I found him. I told him my concept of a bot, gave him my basic framework and he ran with it. Excelled, he even listened when I told everyone that they log mouse and focus actions, yet no one else listened until he posted more in depth information about it. (Oh yeah, you can ignore my flamage. I suggest you do that, as an &quot;emo&quot; I tend to have a bit of a vendetta against lives...)

Semaphore is gone, I can contact him because I have a real-life-relationship with him. But I&#39;m not going to contact him to badger him when I can answer you myself...  Which makes sense when you put into perspective that we were partners and shared source codes of practicly everything. 

Anyways, to answer some inevetable questions, YES. I have xscar&#39;s sources well sources from early on in the project. Anyways, if any of you 
remember, xscar is just the third generation of the thing I started (Scar-J [the java to scar communicating client]), which I abandoned due to lack of interest. If your memory is SUPERB you&#39;ll remember that before aryan, regex also worked on a project like this :-p. He too abandoned it. Just know xScar wasnt as good as it seemed... kkay?

BACK ON SUBJECT NOW.

I&#39;m bored out of my mind. I&#39;ve found more detection routines than anyone to date. I&#39;ve shared most of them, not directly: I shared with semaphore, and he shared with public. (He figured you guys would listen, I figured you wouldnt so I never shared... He has more faith in people than myself though sooooo yeah.) Anyways, we should learn basics of things... There&#39;s an architecture that&#39;s been used for automated self-maintenance in server infrastructures for years, I forget the details but it applies very much so to bots nowadays.. Here I&#39;ll uml it.

       bot -------------&gt; updater
           \                           |
            \--------------- bytecode
             \                         |
              \--------------- regex
               \                       |
                \------ dynamic memory
                 \                     |
                  \_____ assumptions


Not too hard to understand in my mind, simply you have the Bot, it decides it&#39;s broken, it calls the updater, and the updater decides how it is broken, and applies one or all of the (4) methods of updating. They update accordingly and return the bot. Bytecode is of course bytecode, regex is of course regexing the source... Dynamic memory is what I outlined on how to do and then deleted half the article. Assumptions is my fiddle-stick &quot;artificial intelligent&quot; (as krichkovskoy says... lol) updater. Assumptions is the fastest updater, dynamic memory is the second fastest, regex the fourth, and bytecode the third. 

We all know the first 3, the fourth one is too complex unless you&#39;re majoring in the field of mathematics or quantem mathematics... Because it&#39;s the use of datamining and complex algorithms to find patterns fast as shit.




Anyways, peace.</description>

              <p>Wow.</p>
<p>The most accomplished RS hacker of all time is wL. There is no one that approaches him. He did more with the game than anyone I have ever known or heard about. He practically invented the entire private server scene. Though I have talked to PSB on the phone a few times (no more than 4-5), the only thing that we had ever talked about that I can recall being of any importance was the construction dupe. The only botting system I ever shared with him was the first one I had /ever/ made as a proof of concept. I can see how he would somehow think that he took me under his wing. I like how he takes credit for ‘telling me about’ mouse movement logging and focus logging.</p>
<p>Wow. Also, did you know? Larry Page and Sergey Brin both took PSBs idea for a search engine and ran with it. PSB didn’t implement it himself because he figured no one would use it. I hope he doesn’t take this the wrong way but 4-5 phone calls isn’t really a relationship… I /AM/ married… to a woman… as in… happily… like… um… yeah. O_o</p>
<p>The fact is that I had already written a new system. I was already somewhat leery of PSB’s unstable personality. I was already working for a gold selling company with RS and WoW being the two primary games I worked on. And I had already been working with wL.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that he took the fact that I had walked away from the community as an opportunity to lay some kind of claim as king of the dung heap. Not that I was some kind of king, but that I was definitely someone that could call him out on his complete fabrications.</p>
