We are Tupac9. We are a small community that formed after breaking off with a larger one, and we are glad to accept any new members who wish to be with us. We&#39;re looking for new and interesting people who can bring something to the table.

Important: We&#39;re running NoCheat+, LogBlock, and McBans. Don&#39;t try to grief, it will just be rolled-back instantly, so you&#39;re really only inconveniencing yourself. Don&#39;t try to x-ray or use other hacks, because you&#39;ll be McPermaSuperBanned on the spot.The minimum rep required to join is 7.
IP: 198.12.123.208
Dynamic Map: 198.12.123.208:8123


Ranks:
User - Default rank for Tupac9.
Experienced - Given to players who apply for it after two weeks of play.
Veteran - Awarded to players on a respect-basis.
Old Timer - Awarded to players who have been with the server since the dawn of time.

Staff Ranks:
Moderator - A Tupac9 policeman, specializing in griefs.
Admin - Does what a Moderator does and more.
(Most of the Staff-action will be behind the scenes).

Major Plugins:
Towny
NoCheat
LogBlock
WorldEdit
MCBans
BOSEconomy
PeX
uHome
Deadbolt
ChestShop
Worldguard

Rules:
1. No griefing
2. No hacking
3. Swearing is fine
4. PvP is legal, but complaining about it is not.
5. Don&#39;t be an ass
6. Common-sense
7. No abuse of glitches
8. No staff disrespect
Please note that we are pretty lax with non-griefing rules, so getting banned is a pretty big accomplishment.

Stealing:
Stealing is legal, as long as it&#39;s from an unlocked chest. If you need help locking your chests, you can visit the deadbolt bukkit page.

Whitelist?:
For now, no. We&#39;re pretty confident in our ability to manage the few newcomers that we get (if any).[/center]</description>
