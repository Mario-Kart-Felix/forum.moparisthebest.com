              <p>hehe i think i can help again codY!!! Well i know it can boots ur Equipment stats. And you can edit the character file, so i think this might be solveable. I would code like a strength pot or something. I THINKI GOTSOMETIHNG!!!<br>
i don’t know the beginning part.<br>
ENGLISHTRANSLATION: the part I don’t know = if i wield this item …<br>
English Translation: the part I do know = this will happen.<br>
I’ll still give you the part where it raises ur hp level when you wield</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">addSkillXP((1400000000*playerLevel[3]), 3);</code></pre>
<p>that means that whatever you did gave u at least lvl 99 hp  :P.<br>
Ok wielding - i’m guessing so this probably wont work<br>
if(playerWieldsItem(the item number)) then</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">addSkillXP((1400000000*playerLevel[3]), 3);</code></pre>
<p>I know thats not excactly what you needed…but i hope it gave u agood idea</p>
