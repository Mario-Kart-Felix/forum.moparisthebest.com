    <description>[CENTER]Okay so i&#39;m currently working on a little project.
My client is looking like this so far,
[IMG]http://i281.photobucket.com/albums/kk226/chad0ck/pic1.png[/img]

I have this added into the Jframe as &quot;auto crafter&quot; please note this was just a test for the Jframe. 
[SPOILER=&quot;Code&quot;]		case 2:
			JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(null,
			&quot;choose one&quot;, &quot;What would you like to craft?&quot;, JOptionPane.DSTONES_ONYXS_OPTION);
			break;[/SPOILER]
Now the part i&#39;m confused about, How would I come across making this button from the Jframe make the client use an item on another item. For example, a chisel on a sapphire 27 times then make the script stop. 
I will reward a BF3 for pc to who ever helps me. I want help, not free coding. (I would like to learn from this).
I need to some how convert this code to work on a client. 
if (use == 1755 &amp;&amp; useWith == 1755 ) {
