winterLove wrote the first publicly released server, as there was servers built before him. You are all using winterLove’s base, when he doesn’t want you to. He wanted to enhance our ability to emulate RuneScape by just providing an example.<br>
[/quote]So winterLove never meant to really steal anything from jagex, just provide and example of what we could create from it…?[/quote]</p>
<p>he did mean to steal stuff from jagex still. But yes it was an example of what could happen yes.</p>

He never stole anything from JaGex, all he did was download the JAR from RuneScape’s website, deobfuscate it and rename it, sniffed out packets, and wrote a server for it.</p>
