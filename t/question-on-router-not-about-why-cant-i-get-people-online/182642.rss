    <title>Question on router(not about &quot;why can&#39;t I get people online&quot;)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-on-router-not-about-why-cant-i-get-people-online/182642</link>
    <description>O.k. I talked to my friend yesterday on msn and he said you can&#39;t portforward on a wireless router BUT if my dad has a laptop that connects to my computer using that router, does that mean I can portforward on the laptop and host on this computer? I&#39;ve tried for hours, more like days to figure out why I couldn&#39;t portforward. *no wonder no one answered my questions about why people couldn&#39;t log onto my server*. This may save me from all this stress :]</description>

              <p>You can portforward on a wireless router :P. Click <a data-bbcode="true">Here</a><br>
Select your router, then read the guide. Also once you portforward your labtop has the same ip as your Desktop [Home Computer] So therefore you may host on the labtop.<br>
If this doesn’t help, please PM me 'cause I most likely won’t return to this thread.</p>
