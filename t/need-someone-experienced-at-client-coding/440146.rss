    <description>I am working on making the max item amount in my private server higher than the current 2b limit. i have it almost ready for beta testing server sides, though i can not test it unless i have a client that can read it. I am not really good at client sided stuff and have no idea how it even reads/writes the data. The client needs to beable to read a number as a String and convert it from &quot;100000-&gt;100k&quot; and &quot;20000000000-&gt;20T(tril) and upon examining it still show the full string. I would do this my self if i had someone that would explain the client to me though i do not see that happening yet. My server implements BigInteger. 
I also might need help editing the packet data, as the size variation may cause problems. (the resetBank() method, server sided) When it sends the stringed value it might overload the packet, and i need to have it send a flag int, denoting the length of the stringed-number to follow.(along with the packet stuff already sent) I kept bankItems[] as an int, and only changed bankItemsN as there should not be an unreal number of items added in the future. I only converted the bank so far, and not the inventory as that seems like a very LONG task. This one has taken me hours so far and i am still not finished &gt;_&lt;

If you took the time to read this i hope you are interested O_o&#39;

what would have to be done is change playerItemsN and bankItemsN to a long, then you have to edit your client to receive the long [qword] rather than the int now[dword]. dont know the packet off hand but you can find it in resetBank() in your server’s client.java it will give you an idea of what to change, bear in mind this is not for ill experienced coders <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> [i decided to use a long rather than a String because long’s can hold 9billion billion gp the way it is <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> and no the 2nd billion was not a typo.

Oh I was thinking about adding this to my server and using a Long as well but never got around to doing it. But also…it really isn’t a necessary feature so I’ve just postponed it.[/quote]<br>
If you make it a string, the server can take most of the coding, if its a long, the client needs more coding :\ just kind of preference.</p>
