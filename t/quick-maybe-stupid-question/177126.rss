<p>windows allows you to have a certain amount of users for your computer. theres an admin and then a branch of other regular people. i however own this computer so i am of course admin, i was wondering IF i can create an account on windows, log INTO that account…start my server, log off with the files(the server moron)still running…go onto my admin(regular account) and do what i want so the server has a less chance of lagging.[/quote]</p>
<p>You don’t log off, switch accs.</p>
