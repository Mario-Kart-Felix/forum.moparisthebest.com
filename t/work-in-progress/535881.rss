    <description>The internet has opened up the world for everyone. We can now see and hear each other now more than ever before. I&#39;d like to give the credit when credit is due and it belongs to games, specifically online multiplayer games. Online gaming does not possess a country border or religious affairs. You meet people because you&#39;re interested in the same thing so naturally you connect. Often at times (if you&#39;re a typical gamer) you can possibly calculate that you have spent hundreds of hours with this person in the game but yet ... you know nothing about them. This is where my website comes into play. The moto is &quot;Stay Connected&quot;.

So maybe you played runescape with a friend named &#39;mopar&#39;. You can visit the website and submit a gamertag and enter in what you want to say about that person or maybe upload an image of you guys playing the game. After you submit the players information it&#39;s added to their profile.

[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/S9NX8P7.png[/img][/center]

On the profile you can see...

Gamertag
Country Flag
Gamertag avatar.
When they were last recently seen.
What games they have played.
Other aliases.

I have not finished the CSS/HTML work for player profiles. Once I make it neat and organized I&#39;ll release a photo.


[b]Concept[/b]
I personally feel that people are tired of logging into websites and I am taking a wiki like approach. Anyone can add gamertags or games but nobody can delete them. I will be working on profanity filters security issues as I progress.</description>

<p>I will certainly check it out. Thanks! Looks appealing.</p>

<p>This, it sounds like a convenient way to stalk unsuspecting and innocent people who would want nothing to do with this.</p>
<p>How can you be sure the people that claim to have these “gamer tags” aren’t some posers trying to set up people to be slandered against?[/quote]</p>
<p>You don’t ‘claim’ gamertags. There isn’t much stalking on innocent people that would be done. Only information that you give out over a game would be used. So if you gave out your irl details you’re only vulnerable to what information you gave out. The website isn’t intended to be a stalk tool. It’s more of a archive of great memories. You can post pictures of that person to their profile (maybe you killed them and you want to show off) or maybe you are that person and you want to show off anonymously that you went 25-0.</p>
<p>Eventually I want to work out a system where you can pull the player stats from game websites (such as runescape) or other games.</p>
<p>Games always come and go. You play a game and you gain hardly anything out of it but mostly wasted time. I just think it would be unique to look back 5, 10 or 20 years from now and see what you achieved and how you or others impacted the online gaming community. Your stats or game achievements won’t matter but memories… they should be logged <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
