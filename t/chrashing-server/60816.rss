              <p>You’re server base probably does not yet recognize these items. Most items after 6000, are not coded into most serverbases. with the except of some barrows and onyx items. If these items are not in your server base and you try to equip/use/spawn them it can crash and corrupt your account in which you’ll have to individually go in</p>
<p>/characters and click your file and find the item in your inventory or equip roster, and remove it to access your account again. it’s the same as ::pnpc for NPC graphics that don’t yet exist or have been added into a server base. if you do a corrupt ::pnpc code by yourself out of everyone’s site, it only crashes you, if you do it in any area where people can see you, it crashes them as well.</p>
