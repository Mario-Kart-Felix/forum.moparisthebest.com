              <p>[quote=“xweetok599, post:4, topic:337427”]Okay, first open up shops.cfg.</p>
<p>U will see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">shop = 17	Food_Store					2	2	1933	3</code></pre>
<p>The 2 2 means that you can only sell items that this shop haves in stock. If you change this to 1 1, it will be like a general store. The 17 is the ID of the shop. 1933 is the item ID of something that the shop has in stock. The 3 is the quantity of how much the shop has of it. U can make this longer, like:</p>
<p>1234 3 1235 5</p>
<p>The 1234 is the item ID, 1245 too, and the 3 and the 5 are the quantity. 3 of 1234, 5 of 1235.</p>
<p>Add a row at the latest shop you see, and add 1 number more to the ID the latest shop haves.</p>
<p>Now, go to client java. Search for wanneshop until you see something like this:</p>
<p><code>            } else if (NPCID == 2262) { // dark mage robe shop
                PutNPCCoords = true;
                WanneShop = 32;</code></p>
<p>The 2262 is the NPCID of the shop (must be obvious, lol). So when u press talk or trade on THAT NPC, u will see the shop. Change the WanneShop to the shop ID. Hope i helped![/quote]<br>
This is fine and dandy but you forgot a step.</p>
<p>you also have to spawn the npc who is running the shop.</p>
<p>inside of your autospawn.cfg you need to add a new spawn<br>
so goto the bottom and copy the last line and paste it on the next line<br>
so it will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 529	2963	3214	0	0	0	0	0	1	shop
spawn = 529	2963	3214	0	0	0	0	0	1	new shop</code></pre>
<p>ok change that to this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = "your npcid here"	"x-Coord"	"Y-Coord"	0	0	0	0	0	1	shop</code></pre>
<p>I will explain what all the stuff in autospawn.cfg means next.</p>
<blockquote>spawn = 529	2963	3214	0	0	0	0	0	1	shop</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">BLUE:</span><br>
This is the npcid that you want<br>
example: npcid “1” is a man</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">RED:</span><br>
the first set of numbers is the x coordinates<br>
and the second are the y coordinates of where<br>
you want you npc to spawn</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">ORANGE:</span><br>
These are similar to that of red<br>
the first set of numbers is the x coordinates<br>
and the second are the y coordinates<br>
but this time they aren’t where your guy is<br>
going to spawn this time we are making a box<br>
so to speak the x and the y here make the<br>
bottom Right of the box.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">PURPLE:</span><br>
These are similar to that of red<br>
the first set of numbers is the x coordinates<br>
and the second are the y coordinates<br>
but this time they aren’t where your guy is<br>
going to spawn this time we are making a box<br>
so to speak the x and the y here make the<br>
top left of the box.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">YELLOW:</span><br>
idk atm bbl with answer.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">PINK:</span><br>
idk atm bbl with answer.</p>
