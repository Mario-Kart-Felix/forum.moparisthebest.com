    <title>Invalid client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/invalid-client/407113</link>
    <description>Ight so my server only allows 1 client to be played on it which is nice so people cant use cheat clients and all that. but i have my own client i made for a different delta. id like to allow that one too. but the BIGGEST problem with that is that well my client is built from all class files besides the GUI.java

Is there anyway i can decompile all the class files into .java files and have the client run normally?</description>
