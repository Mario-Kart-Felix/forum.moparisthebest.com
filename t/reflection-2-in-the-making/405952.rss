    <title>Reflection 2 -In the Making</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reflection-2-in-the-making/405952</link>
    <description>I thought this should be posted on this forum as well for anyone that uses Simba, so here it is.

[quote=&quot;drags111&quot;]It&#39;s probably more appropriately named Reflection 10,000, but whatever. This time we&#39;re for reals. That&#39;s right, we [me, pyroryan, mormonman, and echo_] are strippin&#39; it down and buildin&#39; it back up. Well, we&#39;ve pretty much already done it. We&#39;re pretty much done in fact! So be advised this is going to happen, and it&#39;s going to happen soon.

So what does this entail?
The reflection include has been redone and for the better. We&#39;ve removed bad code, found and fixed memory leaks, added more useful stuff, more accurate stuff, and cooler stuff. Just yesterday I spent the whole day getting Absolute Coords to work, and it works wonders. Bank.simba was completely redone and now has the ability to withdraw perfectly using scrolling and all. All these changes and more to better help scriptors make more accurate and better bots.

All this is great, but what&#39;s the downside?
Every script will be broken. Some may require a couple of line changes, and some may require bigger changes, but the fact is there will probably not be one script that doesn&#39;t need some changes of some sort. It might be a little frustrating at first, but this is a necessary and proper change to the include. And most changes aren&#39;t very big anyway. One example of a change is that every function or procedure will have R_ in front of it. EVERY one.
Here&#39;s what we will do though. When we release Reflection 2, we will keep the old git open for ~2 more weeks. This will give authors a few weeks to make the changes needed to be up to date with the new include. After those 2 weeks, however, we will shut down the old git and everyone will be using the new one.

When can this be expected?
I would say give it 1 more week, maybe 2. Depending on how things go with school for me and pyro, it should be out in the coming weekend. All that is really left is antirandoms, and some other small changes. Most of everything has been completed. We don&#39;t want to rush anything, as we want perfection in this include. We will do our best to get it here in a timely fashion.

Can we see the development git?
You can, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend using it, unless you really know what you&#39;re doing. I want to get it out there so that script developers can see the changes and get a head start on transitioning their scripts over to the new include.

To be honest the changes to the scripts shouldn&#39;t be that bad, but it&#39;s up to every author to look through the changes and make sure they have everything they need.

Thank you for your time, patience, efforts, feedback, love, care, etc. We appreciate all of your combined efforts to help make this an awesome community.

Sincerely,
Reflection Developers
