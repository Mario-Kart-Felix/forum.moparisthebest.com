              <p>I’m having the same error, but I think it was due to edits I made… Anyway, K O Scape, I notice you are offering a lv 95 RS account for help with this, and also help with another topic… this could upset one player cause you can only give the account to on person <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>Besides, most people on MoparScape forums would be happy to help for nothing…</p>
