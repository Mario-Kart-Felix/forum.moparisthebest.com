    <description>Okay i will admit I am an idiot when it comes to computers.
All I&#39;m here to do is play some fun hacked rs and everytime I try to run a server that has an online time of &quot;100%&quot; it always gives me errors like exceptions, &quot;Error connecting to server&quot;, &quot;loginserver is down, please try again in 1 minuete&quot;,ect.
Can anyone here tell me what i have to do?
I downloaded moparscape 3.2 w/ Aryan already</description>

<p>Post the exact error displayed by the client.</p>
<p>“Error connecting to server” usually means that it can’t find the cache.</p>
<p>“error connecting to server” usually means that you didn’t disable all of the CRC checks in the client.</p>
<p>Although, since you’re using MSCP 3.2, I would assume that it’s the server with the problem. Since most of the servers have altered the protocol (added security, different packets, etc) the MSCP client can’t load it, because as MITB said, “It’s edited just enough to connect to a 317 server” meaning that there’s no added features, no custom items, objects, npcs, etc.</p>
