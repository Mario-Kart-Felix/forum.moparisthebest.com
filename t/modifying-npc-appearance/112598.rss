    <title>Modifying NPC appearance</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/modifying-npc-appearance/112598</link>
    <description>Another question here.

Is there any way to modify what an NPC looks like (or at least make it so he can equip different things)?
I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not possible, but maybe somebody knows.

If that is impossible, is there any way to make it so that I can spawn a *player* that does not require the client (so that it can be controlled by the server as if it were an NPC)?

This would be super-helpful if you could provide any information besides &quot;its not possible&quot;, then I would be extremely grateful.

(Off Topic:  Is there any way that we could split the questions section into 2 categories like *Simple Questions* and *Advanced Questions*, that way so anything I post won&#39;t be shoved to page 7 in six hours like my last question?)</description>

              <p>Thank you for actually saving my post from being forgotten (heh).</p>
<p>Some elaboration might be necessary for the process of going about the npc equip.  I hope it can be done, I just don’t have a clue on how to do it.</p>
<p>Why do we have mods in these forums?  Oh yeah, to take care of those noobish posts from being asked in the advanced forum.  Although you are probably right about that.  (It still would be nice).</p>
<p>[EDIT]  Would the equip code you were talking about be anything like the following code by any chance?</p>
<p><code>		outStream.createFrameVarSizeWord(34);
		outStream.writeWord(1688);
		outStream.writeByte(targetSlot);
		outStream.writeWord((wearID + 1));
		if (amount &gt; 254) {
			outStream.writeByte(255);
			outStream.writeDWord(amount);
		} else {
			outStream.writeByte(amount); //amount	
		}
		outStream.endFrameVarSizeWord();</code><br>
That code is for equiping things to the player (Not necessarily for its appearance).  Am I on the right track or way off?</p>

              <p>im pretty sure you can make npcs equip things as told by some people who do it client side<br>
and im pretty sure that you cant summon another player that doesnt need a client<br>
but pretty good question,i think they should make a advanced question one but other people will still post “newbie questions” in it</p>
