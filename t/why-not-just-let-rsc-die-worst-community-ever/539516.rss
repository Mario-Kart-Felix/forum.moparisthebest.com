    <title>Why not just let RSC die? Worst community EVER</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-not-just-let-rsc-die-worst-community-ever/539516</link>
    <description>There is literally no community of any MMO worse than the RSC community.

It&#39;s full of DDoS-babies, scriptkiddies, 15 year olds, and uncultured British people. And yes, before you say anything, this IS a troll post. I&#39;m trolling the lowest common denominator of our society: Runescape Classic players. 

I challenge anyone on this site to find me one community that Q_Qs and rages more than RSC private servers. Wouldn&#39;t it be more efficient, and less dramatic to let RSC just die and fade into the annals of history, where it belongs? 

Why are you people so determined to revive something that already died a decade ago? Couldn&#39;t your coding talents be utilized elsewhere? If you like DDoSing servers, shouldn&#39;t you work for the government? What exactly keeps you people coming back here? Masochism? Self-hatred? Or do you simply enjoy the culture of incompetence that is bred by RSC?</description>

              <p>Everyone can agree that the community sucks and creates a lack of motivation for anybody to get anything done around here. I remember how updates back in the day were hot shit and praised by the community. Now, whatever you do you will get bashed for even touching rsc. The only thread around here that provides any real community activity is the show off thread. Great way to get your work publicized without being bashed - although I do see some people trash talking about backing it up with their own work - it still encourages some form of development. Let’s not also forget that there are only a selected few who can actually do <span class="bbcode-i">real</span> development. (CFF, Jorgen, Lothy, etc etc)</p>
<p>The thing that people don’t understand with ddos attacks is that if they are not playing your server for a reason. If you decide to attack another server, it’s not going to bring those players back to your server but instead run them out of the community completely. Which is why I have supported all but one server. That’s because I didn’t care for the administrator and his actions and I will never buy into that bs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the RSC/RSPS community will never improve until these people are forcefully removed. Why Moparscape continuously allows these people to re-enter the community, I’ll never understand. The only one that gets a free pass IMO is xEnt because he’s accomplished more than he’s destroyed.</p>

              <p>There is literally no community of any MMO worse than the RSC community.</p>
<p>It’s full of DDoS-babies, scriptkiddies, 15 year olds, and uncultured British people. And yes, before you say anything, this IS a troll post. I’m trolling the lowest common denominator of our society: Runescape Classic players.</p>
<p>I challenge anyone on this site to find me one community that Q_Qs and rages more than RSC private servers. Wouldn’t it be more efficient, and less dramatic to let RSC just die and fade into the annals of history, where it belongs?</p>
<p>Why are you people so determined to revive something that already died a decade ago? Couldn’t your coding talents be utilized elsewhere? If you like DDoSing servers, shouldn’t you work for the government? What exactly keeps you people coming back here? Masochism? Self-hatred? Or do you simply enjoy the culture of incompetence that is bred by RSC?</p>
