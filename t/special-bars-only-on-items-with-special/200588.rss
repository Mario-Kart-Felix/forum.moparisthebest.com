    <title>Special Bars only on items with special</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/special-bars-only-on-items-with-special/200588</link>
    <description>Can someone help me figure out how to only have special bars on certain items. I know that not all servers have special bars, so it must be in my client.java. I would rather have to add special bar to all weapons with special attacks, rather than take them away from the ones that don&#39;t; although I will do either one. I use project czar source, if that makes a difference. Anyways, it is very much appreciated if you help me figure this out.

P.S. (Knowledge already learned)

- I found this code on my server. Think it might have something to do with it.
[code]public void frame70(int i1, int i2, int i3) // 

interface thing, not sure
{
outStream.createFrame(70); // THIS FRAME IS FOR 

SPECIAL ATTACK BAR MOFOS!
outStream.writeWord(i1); // offset X
outStream.writeWordBigEndian(i2); // offset Y
outStream.writeWordBigEndian(i3); // interface, 

definatly.
sendMessage(&quot;Frame 70 tested&quot;);
updateRequired = true;
appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
}
public void framevar70(int i1, int i2, int i3) // no 

idea
{
outStream.createFrameVarSize(70);
outStream.writeWord(i1);
outStream.writeWordBigEndian(i2);
outStream.writeWordBigEndian(i3);
sendMessage(&quot;Framevar 70 tested&quot;);
}[/code]</description>
