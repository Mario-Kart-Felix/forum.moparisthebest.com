    <title>Important folders are classified as &quot;hidden&quot; and they cannot be used</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/important-folders-are-classified-as-hidden-and-they-cannot-be-used/345926</link>
    <description>When i open my source or my client, i notice that some folders are transparent, and its leading to some errors that i get.

the folders are classified as hidden folders, if i click to show hidden folders its the only time they show up, but transparent tho and run.bat cannot locate them

Im almost positive it has somthing to do with when i would put themes on my jailbroken ipod, i needed to convert mp3 format to caf, and i went under control panel-folder options- and the view tab. i changed up some things and im not sure what my old format was like.

if anyone has windows xp can you tell me which things you have checked off?  :rolleyes:</description>
