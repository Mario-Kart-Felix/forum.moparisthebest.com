    <description>[center]Custom IPod Theme + Rockbox + IPod Linux Dual Boot Loader[/center]



Hiya Everyone,
                                 Ive Written this tutorial because of the vast amounts of people that are struggling to do this, Bassicly IpodLinux for a 5.5g ipod requires a very long grualing process of manual installation, therefore undesirable to many. There is however a package that has been compiled to overcome this. In this tutorial we will be installing a custom ipod theme + Rockbox + IPod Linux Dual Boot Loader.

[b]Descriptions-[/b]

[b]Rockbox[/b] is an open source firmware for mp3 players, with this tool you can create your own customised theme, play vast amounts of games through the use of emulators as well as have access to a wide variety of other tools e.g. an iPod flashlight and calculator.

[b]IpodLinux [/b] is basically a downgraded version of Linux for your iPod, in this tutorial I am not really going to focus on it at all for the main reason that all we are using it for is the included boot loader.

[b]Custom iPod themes[/b] are solely to look nice on your iPod, a far cry from the standard theme supplied by apple.

[b]Let’s Begin –[/b]

Firstly lets start by getting all the tools we are going to be needing, go to  -
http://www.ipodwizard.net/cmps_index.php
and download the iPodWizard application, this is the tool we be using to apply the custom theme.

Then go over to –
http://build.rockbox.org/
And download the latest build for your ipod

Finnaly head over to this link and download the ipodlinux application for 5.5g
http://files.filefront.com/iPodLinuxManagerzip/;7353234;/fileinfo.html

Once you have all the necessary tools we can start applying them. Extract the Rockbox file you downloaded and With your iPod in Disk Mode (please Google it if you do not know what this is) Extract  the rockbox .zip file into the root directly of your iPod.

Once you have done this do not unplug or eject your iPod, extract the IpodlInux application you downloaded to your desktop. Once you have extracted it Open the folder named ‘IpodLinuxManager’ and then run the file ‘iPodLinux Manager’. This will automatically install.
Now that you have Rockbox and iPod Linux installed we simply need to add RockBox to the boot loader screen. This can be achieved by simple opening up the rockbox folder on your iPod and copying the file ‘rockbox.ipod’ then pasting it into the root directly of your iPod. IF you have followed this tutorial correctly then the next time you re-boot your iPod a screen like this will, or at least should appear -

[img]http://www.inanoblog.fr/inano/iPodLinux.jpg[/img]

Finnaly you can then go on and find a custom ipod theme and put it onto your ipod with the IpodWizard tool we downloaded earlier. This can be booted from the loader we installed under the name &#39;RetailOS&#39;. My current theme looks like this -

A Detailed tutorial on this can be found on their site, so i will not go into detail about this. If After you install the theme it replaces the boot loader you may need to Start the process again, by firstly installing your custom theme. Not a big deal however.

[center][b]Extras[/b][/center]

Doom – This comes with rock box you just simply need to download and extract the plug-in to play it. The plug-in is available from here –
http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/PluginDoom

Along with the guide how to install with.
Pre-made RockBox themes can be found here –
http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/WpsGallery

A great resources for any iPod customisation information is here –

Check out their forums 



[b]Ending comments[/b] - Im sorry this tutorial is a bit &#39;Bare&#39; When i get around to it i will fill it up with more information. If you are having any trouble feel free just to say what you are stuck on and i wiill get round to helping you A.S.A.P. Enjoy!

[b]Also this is what i consider the be the &#39;Easiest&#39; Method to acheive the desired result. If anyone finds this method to be obselete please let me know.[/b]</description>

You just don’t give up, do you? I’m unsure whether it works because the topic is based around the iPod video, but someone mentioned using it on a 1st gen nano. It’s just a simple question.[/quote]<br>
Even a lobotomized 10-year-old knows the Apple has been encrypting the firmware from nano 2G and upwards.</p>

<p>What?!? iPodLinux DOES play sound. The advantage is that you can play Pokemen on an iPod (And tons of other games). For the themes, I am not totally sure. I know about Podzilla 2 WHICH you do have to install manually (Pain in the ass, but worth it). And yes, once again, the themes are easy to remove. Also, you can watch movies on a first gen nano ;).</p>

<p>Ipod linux is customizable but using the custom ipod firmware with a difffrent theme in my opinion is allways the better option with the duel boot loader. Glad you guys like the tutorial and hope it helped some of you out.</p>

              <p>What?!? iPodLinux DOES play sound. The advantage is that you can play Pokemen on an iPod (And tons of other games). For the themes, I am not totally sure. I know about Podzilla 2 WHICH you do have to install manually (Pain in the ass, but worth it). And yes, once again, the themes are easy to remove. Also, you can watch movies on a first gen nano ;).</p>

              <p>Ipodlinux doesn’t play sound, so that’s where Rockbox comes in. So if you want to listen to pirated music with licenses all over them, you’ll have to use Rockbox. Rockbox can be synced with Winamp and itunes. iPodLinux can be synced like that as well. If you’re going to use a custom Firmware, you MUST backup the original. So that you can return to the original Firmware to maybe fix your iPod, or take it to an apple store. You can also go to the Manufacturers sysconfig menu and format your iPod completely.</p>
<p>The themes are modifications of the iPod OS. So you don’t need anything but iPodWizard and a theme to theme your iPod. They have quite a large selection of nice themes at <a href="http://www.ipodwizard.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ipodwizard.net/</a> pick out one you like.</p>

              <p>[quote=“ThAt0n36Uy, post:2, topic:204086”]The problem with iPodLinux for iPod 5.5g is it is very unstable. Rockbox is really a whole other problem. Most of the applications and themes don’t work correctly. I had to install iPod Linux, reinstall Linux on my desktop, and then transfer the files, which for me, was a complete hassle. All because Rockbox didn’t work correctly. Thankfully now I just develop my own stuff for it.</p>
<p>Theislander’s themes are pretty awesome for the most part. They’re very glitchy, and have some missing images, or placeholders are out of whack. But they look beautiful. The album cover part of the firmware has huge glitches, but it’s still pretty sweet. The Mac-ish dock one of his themes really kills the RAM. It seems to wear out my battery much faster as well. But I can live with a bit of battery loss while listening in style.[/quote]</p>
<p>I couldnt agree with your more. thats why i chose the installer that i did. it provides a slightly downgraded version of the Ipodlinux but includes Everything that i was intereted in using. Rockbox on the other hand i havnt really had many problems with. As far as my usage goes its been pretty stable throughout. I do agree with you slighty on the theme side of things but as i use rockbox solely for Non-music usage its never been that big of a deal, hense the reason i used the boot loader.</p>
<p>Once more you are correct, the islanmder has about 2 or 3 amazing themes, really nice. but once again buggy. The one im currently using is by far his best in my opinion with few…if any bugs i beleive. Ive been using it around 3 days and the only error was a small text placement that fixed itself on reboot.</p>
<p>If you have any knowledge that you think would be usefull maybe we could talk sometime?</p>

              <p>The problem with iPodLinux for iPod 5.5g is it is very unstable. Rockbox is really a whole other problem. Most of the applications and themes don’t work correctly. I had to install iPod Linux, reinstall Linux on my desktop, and then transfer the files, which for me, was a complete hassle. All because Rockbox didn’t work correctly. Thankfully now I just develop my own stuff for it.</p>
<p>Theislander’s themes are pretty awesome for the most part. They’re very glitchy, and have some missing images, or placeholders are out of whack. But they look beautiful. The album cover part of the firmware has huge glitches, but it’s still pretty sweet. The Mac-ish dock one of his themes really kills the RAM. It seems to wear out my battery much faster as well. But I can live with a bit of battery loss while listening in style.</p>

              <p>[center]Custom IPod Theme + Rockbox + IPod Linux Dual Boot Loader[/center]</p>
<p>Hiya Everyone,<br>
Ive Written this tutorial because of the vast amounts of people that are struggling to do this, Bassicly IpodLinux for a 5.5g ipod requires a very long grualing process of manual installation, therefore undesirable to many. There is however a package that has been compiled to overcome this. In this tutorial we will be installing a custom ipod theme + Rockbox + IPod Linux Dual Boot Loader.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Descriptions-</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Rockbox</span> is an open source firmware for mp3 players, with this tool you can create your own customised theme, play vast amounts of games through the use of emulators as well as have access to a wide variety of other tools e.g. an iPod flashlight and calculator.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">IpodLinux </span> is basically a downgraded version of Linux for your iPod, in this tutorial I am not really going to focus on it at all for the main reason that all we are using it for is the included boot loader.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Custom iPod themes</span> are solely to look nice on your iPod, a far cry from the standard theme supplied by apple.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Let’s Begin –</span></p>
<p>Firstly lets start by getting all the tools we are going to be needing, go to  -<br>
<a href="http://www.ipodwizard.net/cmps_index.php" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ipodwizard.net/cmps_index.php</a><br>
and download the iPodWizard application, this is the tool we be using to apply the custom theme.</p>
<p>Then go over to –<br>
<a href="http://build.rockbox.org/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://build.rockbox.org/</a><br>
And download the latest build for your ipod</p>
<p>Finnaly head over to this link and download the ipodlinux application for 5.5g<br>
<a href="http://files.filefront.com/iPodLinuxManagerzip/;7353234;/fileinfo.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://files.filefront.com/iPodLinuxManagerzip/;7353234;/fileinfo.html</a></p>
<p>Once you have all the necessary tools we can start applying them. Extract the Rockbox file you downloaded and With your iPod in Disk Mode (please Google it if you do not know what this is) Extract  the rockbox .zip file into the root directly of your iPod.</p>
<p>Once you have done this do not unplug or eject your iPod, extract the IpodlInux application you downloaded to your desktop. Once you have extracted it Open the folder named ‘IpodLinuxManager’ and then run the file ‘iPodLinux Manager’. This will automatically install.<br>
Now that you have Rockbox and iPod Linux installed we simply need to add RockBox to the boot loader screen. This can be achieved by simple opening up the rockbox folder on your iPod and copying the file ‘rockbox.ipod’ then pasting it into the root directly of your iPod. IF you have followed this tutorial correctly then the next time you re-boot your iPod a screen like this will, or at least should appear -<br>

<a href="http://g.imageshack.us/g.php?h=337&amp;i=bootloaderca8.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/1029/bootloaderca8.33ca29d9fd.jpg" alt width="" height=""></a><br>
<img src="http://www.inanoblog.fr/inano/iPodLinux.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Finnaly you can then go on and find a custom ipod theme and put it onto your ipod with the IpodWizard tool we downloaded earlier. This can be booted from the loader we installed under the name ‘RetailOS’. My current theme looks like this -</p>

A Detailed tutorial on this can be found on their site, so i will not go into detail about this. If After you install the theme it replaces the boot loader you may need to Start the process again, by firstly installing your custom theme. Not a big deal however.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Extras</span>[/center]</p>
<p>Doom – This comes with rock box you just simply need to download and extract the plug-in to play it. The plug-in is available from here –<br>
<a href="http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/PluginDoom" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/PluginDoom</a></p>
<p><img src="http://www.tuaw.com/images/2005/11/iDoom_screen.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
