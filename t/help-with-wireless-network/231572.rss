    <description>there is this guy around our house who has wireless internet named &quot;default&quot; (its unprotected)

as you would expect, i use his internet instead of mine.

i have downloaded a lot of stuff.

you know some of those services who charge extra per megabyte for going over download limit? i wonder if he has one of those plans.

i would feel really bad if i get him a huge bill.

so i was wondering is there anyway for me to know his download limit or trace the wireless connection to his house so i can ask him?  or to find out what his download limit or plan is.

these are the details i have so far:
ip:
122.108.18.145 (OPTUS INTERNET - RETAIL)

i traced the ip and got:
c122-108-18-145.eburwd9.vic.optusnet.com.au 

any clue?
ps.im in melbourne Australia.</description>
