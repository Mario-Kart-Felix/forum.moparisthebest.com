    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-see-other-players-invisible/152332</link>
    <description>I am currently making the fight caves, and i want it like runescape, where u can&#39;t see other people, and i don&#39;t mean just not see them, i want them to not be there at all.  I want you to be able to kill ur own npcs.  If anyone knows how to make it so u are the only one there and no one else can see u and u can&#39;t see them.  If anyone knows how to do this i would greatly appreciate it.</description>
