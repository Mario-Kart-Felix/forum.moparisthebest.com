    <title>Hamachi Questions [PLEASE LOOK!]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hamachi-questions-please-look/396146</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s just something i&#39;m missing... but i cant get my hamachi to work right. So here&#39;s what i&#39;ve done so far.
Steps:
1] I downloaded Hamachi LogmeIn and created my server with the password and everything.
2] I downloaded Hamachi LogmeIn on my other computer and joined my server with the user and passcode.
3] I kept the Ip address on the computer in step #1 127.0.0.1 for my GUI
4] I changed the Ip address on the computer in step #2 to the Ip address of the server thing i created in my GUI.
5] compiled both

I&#39;m using a Bluur client on the computer in #1 and i downloaded Pkz Vengance client for Computer in step #2.

Results: When i log in on computer in step #1 it works fine and runs properly. No errors on server run.bat what so ever.
When i attempt to log in on computer #2 it loads, logs me in and then kicks me right back out every time.
and Hamachi works on my computers because i&#39;ve hosted another private server with it before. So please help me.  :confused:</description>
