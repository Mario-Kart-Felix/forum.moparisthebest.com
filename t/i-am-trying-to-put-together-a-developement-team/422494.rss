    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-am-trying-to-put-together-a-developement-team/422494</link>
    <description>I am Onelife, and i am wanting to put together a developement team for learning purposes, and to create an RSPS. I want to put together a team of experienced coders and developers to try and create a revolutionary server, the server will include all the latest items, ideas and customs. Plus some ideas of my own. My name in real life is Chris. I have been trying for a long time to find a team of coders, or atleast one coder that i could work with. I am willing to code and put up a website to use. Please reply to this topic and please message me if you are interested in creating a coding and developing team with me. Thanks for your time.</description>
