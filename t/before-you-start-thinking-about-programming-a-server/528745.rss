    <description>[center][size=14pt][b]Please note that this tutorial can be widely expanded on as of the moment. I am taking suggestions on what to add that a developer might consider while tackling a project.[/b][/size]
Also, help me with revising each section on what they should really say, I wrote this on 30 hours without sleep.[/center]

[b]Aim of this tutorial:[/b] To give users a check list of things they should consider before taking a RuneScape Private Server (RSPS) project. 

[i]Before you tl;dr, I implore to give this a read even if you&#39;ve considered everything written in this tutorial beforehand. It may prove useful to motivate or remind you of things you&#39;ll need during your project.[/i]

[anchor=classic][b]Getting Started[/b][/anchor]
So you&#39;re probably wondering, &quot;why do I need this tutorial when there&#39;s sources out there which can give me the information I need?&quot; and that&#39;s good. However, I want to lead and guide whomever reads this into the right direction when they begin their project. A resource of what you need to know, what you need to consider, and some important tips to remember when you begin so that you can confidently begin your project knowing you can tackle the workload.

[anchor=sucks][b]Things you&#39;ll need to know before you start[/b][/anchor]
So what do you consider when you start a project? Well you really need to lay out some guidelines and in the world of RSPS there are two approaches you can branch from. The first is writing your server from scratch. A popular approach when trying to learn about server-client communication and JAVA as a whole, this approach is taken by a variety of members who in some shape or form have contributed their time to the private server scene. Many servers which started with this approach were not developed alone and had multiple members contributing to the project at one time. When beginning a project from scratch, you need to consider:

[ul][li]Goals you&#39;re trying to reach[/li]
[li]Can you do it alone[/li]
[li]Will you drop the project because of the workload[/li][/ul]

If you cannot do it alone, consider your options with creating a development team by creating a topic [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,149.0.html]here[/url]

I will elaborate more on how to approach creating a scratch server in a later [iurl=#league]section[/iurl].

The second option you have when beginning a project is taking an existing source and using it to begin your server. This is the easiest and most common route taken by many servers hosted today and a small portion of the most popular servers created have come from pre-existing sources. Now, you might be wondering, &quot;why should I consider anything when there&#39;s already servers ready to be hosted?&quot;

The thing with taking on a project RSPS is that you do not want to be a copy of another person&#39;s server, otherwise you will lose credibility as a hoster/developer and likely lose players. You cannot simply assume that you can download a server, run it, advertise it, and expect your server to succeed either. With this is mind, you&#39;re probably expected to run into various errors or troublesome bugs because no code or script is completely perfect (unless [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=481392]drubrkletern[/url] programs it).

[anchor=at][b]Essential knowledge to developing a server[/b][/anchor]
The first thing you&#39;re going to want to do is experiment with JAVA (most common language the server is programmed in). There are a handful of websites and sources online and &quot;try it yourself&quot; tutorials floating around the internet. The most common can be found here at [url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/]oracle[/url]. 

We also have a giant pack of language learning documents (found in the sticky) and members willing to help with your questions in [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,158.0.html]General Programming[/url]. 
Don&#39;t forget to check out [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,213.0.html]GameDev[/url] if your project doesn&#39;t pertain to RSPS.

Now, you&#39;re got some basic java knowledge in and you can modify basic settings or copy &amp; paste snippets correctly, what else will you need to know? For website related content such as home pages, forums, etc, you or someone on your team will need to familiarize themselves with HTML, PHP, XML, and various other languages in order to integrate systems like hiscores, forums, and customer support. Again, a resource for these languages can be found in the General Programming board and the [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,228.0.html]Web Design/Dev[/url] board.

[anchor=outro][b]Finishing up[/b][/anchor]
Good, you&#39;ve made it this far or you&#39;ve simply skipped to this section. Either way, I hope this has been enlightening on expanding your thought process when tackling a RSPS project but you need a bit more help. That&#39;s what the tutorial section is for! Here are a couple starter tutorials to look at which can answer some more common questions about RSPS specifically

[li][url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,342685.0.html]How to Start a Server [/url][/li][/ul]


Don&#39;t forget to check out the [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,235.0.html]Featured Tutorials[/url] board which contain well written and in-depth guides pertaining to their subject matter.

Happy programming,

So you’re probably wondering, “why do I need this tutorial when there’s sources out there which can give me the information I need?” and that’s good. However, I want to lead and guide whomever reads this into the right direction when they begin their project. A resource of what you need to know, what you need to consider, and some important tips to remember when you begin so that you can confidently begin your project knowing you can tackle the workload.</p>
<p>[anchor=sucks]<span class="bbcode-b">Things you’ll need to know before you start</span>[/anchor]<br>
So what do you consider when you start a project? Well you really need to lay out some guidelines and in the world of RSPS there are two approaches you can branch from. The first is writing your server from scratch. A popular approach when trying to learn about server-client communication and JAVA as a whole, this approach is taken by a variety of members who in some shape or form have contributed their time to the private server scene. Many servers which started with this approach were not developed alone and had multiple members contributing to the project at one time. When beginning a project from scratch, you need to consider:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Goals you’re trying to reach[/li]<br>
[li]Can you do it alone[/li]<br>
[li]Will you drop the project because of the workload[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>If you cannot do it alone, consider your options with creating a development team by creating a topic <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,149.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></p>
<p>I will elaborate more on how to approach creating a scratch server in a later [iurl=#league]section[/iurl].</p>
<p>The second option you have when beginning a project is taking an existing source and using it to begin your server. This is the easiest and most common route taken by many servers hosted today and a small portion of the most popular servers created have come from pre-existing sources. Now, you might be wondering, “why should I consider anything when there’s already servers ready to be hosted?”</p>
<p>The thing with taking on a project RSPS is that you do not want to be a copy of another person’s server, otherwise you will lose credibility as a hoster/developer and likely lose players. You cannot simply assume that you can download a server, run it, advertise it, and expect your server to succeed either. With this is mind, you’re probably expected to run into various errors or troublesome bugs because no code or script is completely perfect (unless <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=481392" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">drubrkletern</a> programs it).</p>
<p>[anchor=at]<span class="bbcode-b">Essential knowledge to developing a server</span>[/anchor]<br>
The first thing you’re going to want to do is experiment with JAVA (most common language the server is programmed in). There are a handful of websites and sources online and “try it yourself” tutorials floating around the internet. The most common can be found here at <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">oracle</a>.</p>
<p>We also have a giant pack of language learning documents (found in the sticky) and members willing to help with your questions in <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,158.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">General Programming</a>.<br>
Don’t forget to check out <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,213.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">GameDev</a> if your project doesn’t pertain to RSPS.</p>
<p>Now, you’re got some basic java knowledge in and you can modify basic settings or copy &amp; paste snippets correctly, what else will you need to know? For website related content such as home pages, forums, etc, you or someone on your team will need to familiarize themselves with HTML, PHP, XML, and various other languages in order to integrate systems like hiscores, forums, and customer support. Again, a resource for these languages can be found in the General Programming board and the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,228.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Web Design/Dev</a> board.</p>

Good, you’ve made it this far or you’ve simply skipped to this section. Either way, I hope this has been enlightening on expanding your thought process when tackling a RSPS project but you need a bit more help. That’s what the tutorial section is for! Here are a couple starter tutorials to look at which can answer some more common questions about RSPS specifically</p>
