    <title>317 loading</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-loading/387503</link>
    <description>I currently have a 317 loading 525 char models and anims, but how do I make it load 508/525 textures? Don&#39;t suggest google I&#39;ve looked and I want to keep my source not dl another 1 oh and its a project insanity. I did manage to get a hold of the 508 brick models for lumby castle but I can&#39;t find any floors... ik it will make it unstable. 317s are all unstable but I really don&#39;t care</description>

<p>Heres your solution: STOP ruining 317 and leave them how they are. no-one wants 508+ anymore. if you/them want 508+anims, gfx or textures etc you can do to a game called RUNESCAPE!<br>
Another solution: StOp makimg 317’s unstable (more). If you want 508+ then you get a client and source of it.</p>
<p>I hope I helped!!</p>

<p>This did not help at seeing as how your just ranting on about stuff that only you care about. obviously he wants these things in his game so you dont need to tell him that nobody wants 508+ because that is just your opinion.<br>

<p>And your 8 right?</p>
<p>Young enough not to be able to see sarcasm.<br>
I said that 508+ ruins every 317. My opinion? No, every opinion of every coder who knows what he’s doing.<br>
I like 508. Not on 317 though. Only on a 508 source[/quote]<br>
You’re one to bring age into this? and BTW  when people say “coder” they obviously have no idea what the fuck there saying the correct word is programmer dumb ass. you probably dont even no what a method is. and just because you dont like 508+ things in a 317 dosent mean its incorrect for anyone else to like/do it so gtfo.</p>
