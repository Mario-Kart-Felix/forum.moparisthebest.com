    <title>Can someone explain how clients work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-explain-how-clients-work/547853</link>
    <description>How do they work? How does the client decrypt the cache files, and display it on the screen? What is to stop us from getting cache from Arcanists, and making private servers out of it? What else is required to make them run?

Thanks</description>

              <p>i know enigma / silab / david all worked on making a working deob. davidi2 got it working / some refactored and then gave up and lost code because <span class="bbcode-b">everyone seems to think it would be a waste of time</span> when the game only died because the code wasn’t maintained or updated.</p>
<p>i attempted the same project and got the client from the cache/deobbed but never fixed all the errors as i was in over my head.</p>
<p>i feel as though this could easily be done in a matter of days if the people with the knowledge took the time to do it. and if anyone ever got the cache format down - the world would be so much better. its an amazing game and its so fun to play / a private server would be extremely cool with the amount of physics already in the client - theres no stopping what type of gameplay/matches/spells could be added!</p>
<p>tho - nothing is stopping anyone from doing it - it is a dead game. people with knowledge dont want to bother because it isn’t quite so simple.</p>

Nope, it just requires lots of reverse engineering. There is no specific documentation for Jagex products alone, you have to take the general principles and apply them to whatever you want.</p>
