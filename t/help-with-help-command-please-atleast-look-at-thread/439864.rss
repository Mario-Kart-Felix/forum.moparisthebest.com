    <title>Help with ::help command [Please atleast look at thread]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-help-command-please-atleast-look-at-thread/439864</link>
    <description>Okay i am adding help command that uses ::alert system to send it my problem is that it sends to &quot;every&quot; player on server i added command like this [code]if (playerCommand.equals(&quot;help&quot;)) {
				if (System.currentTimeMillis() - c.lastHelp &lt; 30000) {
					c.sendMessage(&quot;You can only do this every 30 seconds.&quot;);
					return;
				}
				String msg = &quot;May I get some help please.&quot;;
				for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++) {
					if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {
						Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[j];
						if (c.playerRights == 1){
								c2.sendMessage(&quot;Alert##Notification##&quot; + msg + &quot;##By: &quot; + c.playerName);
						c.lastHelp = System.currentTimeMillis();
						} else if (c.playerRights == 2){
								c2.sendMessage(&quot;Alert##Notification##&quot; + msg + &quot;##By: &quot; + c.playerName);
							c.lastHelp = System.currentTimeMillis();
							} else if (c.playerRights == 3){
								c2.sendMessage(&quot;Alert##Notification##&quot; + msg + &quot;##By: &quot; + c.playerName);
						c.lastHelp = System.currentTimeMillis();
						} else if (c.playerRights == 0){
								c2.sendMessage(&quot;Alert##Notification##&quot; + msg + &quot;##By: &quot; + c.playerName);
							c.lastHelp = System.currentTimeMillis();
							} else if (c.playerRights == 4){
								c2.sendMessage(&quot;Alert##Notification##&quot; + msg + &quot;##By: &quot; + c.playerName);
						c.lastHelp = System.currentTimeMillis();
						}
					}
				}
			}[/code]
Now you might just say to add command like this [code]  if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;help&quot;)) {
                                if (System.currentTimeMillis() - c.lastHelp &lt; 30000) {
                                        c.sendMessage(&quot;You can only do this every 30 seconds.&quot;);
                                }
                                for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++) {
                                        if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {
                                                Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[j];
                                                if(Connection.isMuted(c)){
                                                        c.sendMessage(&quot;You can&#39;t ask for help when you&#39;re muted.&quot;);
                                                        return;
                                                }
                                                if (c.Jail == true) {
                                                        c.sendMessage(&quot;You can&#39;t ask for help in jail.&quot;);
                                                        return;
                                                }
                                                if (PlayerHandler.players[j].playerRights &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; PlayerHandler.players[j].playerRights &lt; 4 &amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() - c.lastHelp &gt; 30000) {
                                                        c2.sendMessage(&quot;[HELP MESSAGE] &lt;shad=15536940&gt;&quot;+Misc.optimizeText(c.playerName)+&quot;&lt;/shad&gt; needs help. Coordinates are: &lt;shad=15536940&gt;&quot;+c.absX+&quot;, &quot;+c.absY+&quot;&lt;/shad&gt;.&quot;);
                                                        c.lastHelp = System.currentTimeMillis();
                                                }
                                        }
                                }
                        }
[/code]
But the problem with this command is it doesnt send to every staff member online it only sends to one staff member and that is the first staff member to logg in and if u dont know what staff means its anyone with 1 through 3 playerrights.
Please if u can help i would really appreciate it.</description>

<p><code>&amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() - c.lastHelp &gt; 30000</code> this is your problem.<br>
Every time it goes around, it checks the lastHelp and since you set it to currentTime the first loop around, the second time it will not have been 30 seconds yet. :3</p>
<p>to fix it, remove it from within your for loop. You already checked for it before the loop so you don’t need to verify it again anyways. and just make it “return” after the first 30 second check.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>This is just checking if the player has done the command in the last 30 seconds, it has absolutely nothing to do with player rights.[/quote]</p>
<p>His problem was that it only sent it to the first mod online. once it has been sent once, it sets the timer to the CURRENTTIME, therefore when the loop runs the second time, and notices the “timeset-current&lt;30000” it goes F*** YOU I QUIT.(this is unless you have a computer that takes more than 30 seconds for it to make one time around a for loop, which is similar to the TI-43 calculator)<br>
Therefore the problem has nothing to do with the playerRights either, i would bet money that my code would fix his error <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> (had he not already found a work-around) I got a feeling he set his code up similar to messageToAll, but only sends if (0&lt;playerRights&lt;4).</p>
<p>I am going to be redundant but its the only way people will understand this.</p>

This is the problem. Once it sets it to true, what is it supposed to do when it finds the second person? A decent computer would have less than 43ms difference between these(if the two mods were less than 5 players apart), to me that is a little less than 30000ms... 
<p>If he were to debug this (add outputs to his variables he is using) he would of found his problem himself.</p>

If he were to run this in its place, he would notice the problem.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: learn to debug? :o I don’t think i have ever had to come to the forum to ask for help. i just output it.(i may have, but not much) Will be adding another tip to my guide now too…</p>

              <p><code>&amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() - c.lastHelp &gt; 30000</code> this is your problem.<br>
Every time it goes around, it checks the lastHelp and since you set it to currentTime the first loop around, the second time it will not have been 30 seconds yet. :3</p>
<p>to fix it, remove it from within your for loop. You already checked for it before the loop so you don’t need to verify it again anyways. and just make it “return” after the first 30 second check.</p>

              <p>Okay i am adding help command that uses ::alert system to send it my problem is that it sends to “every” player on server i added command like this <code>if (playerCommand.equals("help")) {
				if (System.currentTimeMillis() - c.lastHelp &lt; 30000) {
					c.sendMessage("You can only do this every 30 seconds.");
					return;
				}
				String msg = "May I get some help please.";
				for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++) {
					if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {
						Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[j];
						if (c.playerRights == 1){
								c2.sendMessage("Alert##Notification##" + msg + "##By: " + c.playerName);
						c.lastHelp = System.currentTimeMillis();
						} else if (c.playerRights == 2){
								c2.sendMessage("Alert##Notification##" + msg + "##By: " + c.playerName);
							c.lastHelp = System.currentTimeMillis();
							} else if (c.playerRights == 3){
								c2.sendMessage("Alert##Notification##" + msg + "##By: " + c.playerName);
						c.lastHelp = System.currentTimeMillis();
						} else if (c.playerRights == 0){
								c2.sendMessage("Alert##Notification##" + msg + "##By: " + c.playerName);

								c2.sendMessage("Alert##Notification##" + msg + "##By: " + c.playerName);

Now you might just say to add command like this <code>  if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase("help")) {
                                if (System.currentTimeMillis() - c.lastHelp &lt; 30000) {
                                        c.sendMessage("You can only do this every 30 seconds.");
                                }
                                for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++) {
                                        if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {
                                                Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[j];
                                                if(Connection.isMuted(c)){
                                                        c.sendMessage("You can't ask for help when you're muted.");
                                                        return;
                                                }
                                                if (c.Jail == true) {
                                                        c.sendMessage("You can't ask for help in jail.");
                                                        return;
                                                }
                                                if (PlayerHandler.players[j].playerRights &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; PlayerHandler.players[j].playerRights &lt; 4 &amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() - c.lastHelp &gt; 30000) {
                                                        c2.sendMessage("[HELP MESSAGE] &lt;shad=15536940&gt;"+Misc.optimizeText(c.playerName)+"&lt;/shad&gt; needs help. Coordinates are: &lt;shad=15536940&gt;"+c.absX+", "+c.absY+"&lt;/shad&gt;.");
                                                        c.lastHelp = System.currentTimeMillis();
                                                }
                                        }
                                }
                        }
</code><br>
But the problem with this command is it doesnt send to every staff member online it only sends to one staff member and that is the first staff member to logg in and if u dont know what staff means its anyone with 1 through 3 playerrights.<br>
Please if u can help i would really appreciate it.</p>
