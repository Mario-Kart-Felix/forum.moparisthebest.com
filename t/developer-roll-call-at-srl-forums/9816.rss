    <description>  SRL Roll Call at [url=http://WWW.Villu-Reborn.Com]WWW.Villu-Reborn.Com[/url]  ( or you can use the other domain as they both goto same place :P )  We just need to see who is still with SRL and who has mov ed on please goto the forums and post if your still in the SRL project, if you have moved on and u still read the forums then please post that or if your totally done then well guess you wont read this so your silence will be enough...

Thank You

PS : No Im not removing Developers or Users yet i just wanna see who is still with the project and who is MIA,  but soon we will have to remove Absent Developers just to prevent future leaks as SRL will once again be a execellent include and will be something worth leaking in the near future. :P</description>
