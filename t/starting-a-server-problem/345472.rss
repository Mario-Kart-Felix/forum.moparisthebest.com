    <title>Starting a server problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/starting-a-server-problem/345472</link>
    <description>Hello, me and my brother have recently decided to begin coding our own server. He&#39;s been studying java languages (something about c++, and other stuff, i&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s called exactly.), and I&#39;m working so I can provide payment for a website, vps, etc. We&#39;ve been trying to Get our server online and accessible by players before we start coding it, but we&#39;ve hit a road bump. 

I&#39;ve found a source I want, code for client+server is fine, I&#39;ve gotten both compilers working correctly. 
I&#39;ve port forwarded my router, which is linksys by cisco. 
I&#39;ve added inbound and outbound rules in my windows firewall for port 43594(port our server uses.)
I&#39;ve registered a no-ip, and created an account, added a host with the chosen ip of my server. 

Still, no one can connect via the IP. 
I can connect on the same computer the server is being run on via the 127.0.0.1 ip, but not with the no-ip i created.

I&#39;m running windows 7, I have norton antivirus, and cox highspeed internet. 
Not sure what else you would need to help me, but i&#39;ll provide it asap if you ask for it. 

I&#39;d appreciate any help I can get. 

Thanks in advance.</description>
