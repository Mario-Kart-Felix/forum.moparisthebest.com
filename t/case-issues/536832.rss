    <title>Case issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/case-issues/536832</link>
    <description>Okay, so i recently got into coding interfaces, but my question here is...
what?
okay, so i know how cases work and such, but sometimes id&#39;s and cases are the same, other times they have nothing to do with eachother..?
I&#39;m trying to make custom emotes at the moment, currently doing skillcape emote..
when the id and case are both &#39;154&#39; it works, but when i change them to 25000, it wont work?
just need an explanation of how cases work so i can make custom buttons work properly.
heres the code for the working button, gave it a random emote though till i code the skillcape check.
&lt;blockquote&gt;addButton(154, 32, &quot;/Emotes/EMOTE&quot;, &quot;Skillcape&quot;,41,47);&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;case 154:
	c.startAnimation(2112);
	break;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

              <p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:2, topic:536832”]The addButton number, right there (154) doesn’t tell you the id of the clicking button case, and that is where you’re getting mixed up.</p>
<p>The clicking button case (from what I’ve seen) number will not change if you change the button id (from addButton). The clicking button id is separate from that and is sent when you actually ‘click’ the button (hence the class name). To find out what the ID would be, above the switch statement, add something like:<br>
System.out.println("Clicking button ID: "+ actionbuttonid);<br>
Now you’ll have to change ‘actionbuttonid’ to what ever your variable is. After you compile and run, every time you click a button the server’s console will print the button id for you. The id probably will still be 154.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yea, i found out there was an actionButton teller already added to my source, had to change a few things for it to work though, but this can be closed now.</p>
