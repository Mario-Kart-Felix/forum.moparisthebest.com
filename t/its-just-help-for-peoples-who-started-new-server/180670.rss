    <description>hello, im maked this psot for peoples who dont know mucha bout coding but i think everyone know about thing called silabsoft client and when u download client much of items got no bonus...so there the help:

1)Go to your server

2)Go to item.cfg

3)And find the item u want to change by the item&#39;s ip.

4)when u find just move left (if the item has no bonus it must have be 0, 0 means bonuse&#39;s just change it ;)

                                                        CHANGING ITEM AT SHOPS

There u will learn how to change shops items like for peoples who want to get some cool shops:


1)go to server

2)go to shops.cfg 

3)find shop that&#39;s item u want to change

4)u will se something like this:

shop = 28	Rannaerl&#39;s_Super_Skirt_Store.			2	2	1087	5	1081	3	1083	2	1089	1	1085	1	1091	1



the codes like 1081 ,1083 ,1089 ,1085 ,1091 is items ip, the 3,2,1,1,1,2,2 is how many items are in shop jsut change ip to ur wanted item and the 1,2,3 and others to how many u want the items and save it :)


                                                       changing NPC&#39;s place

This will help you for peoples who want to change NPC&#39;s place its easy but i added cuz peoples asked me not once:

1)go to autospawn.cfg

2)find the NPC that u want to change

3)go to left

4)u will see something like this:

spawn = 461	2904	3554	0	0	0	0	0	1	Rune Store

the 2904 and 3554 is NPC&#39;s cordinates u will need to change it to ur wanted place like i want to get him to those cordinates:

spawn = 461	9999	9999	0	0	0	0	0	1	Rune Store

that&#39;s all.

well i think thats all if peoples dont flame and give me feedbacks i would make more:)
