    <title>Yet another Portforwarding problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/yet-another-portforwarding-problem/372191</link>
    <description>Yes yes I know! Another!! Sorry but I have spent 2ish days on this one problem and its really getting me mad :P! 
Heres the deal. I have an Apple AirPort router that doesnt support port forwarding (It has all ports open) but my gateway (an Actiontec) has portforwarding options. In the past (someone helped me) I portforwarded on there. It worked last time so why not this time. Go figure. It doesn&#39;t. I portforward and click &quot;Save and Restart&quot; after the restart my ISP assigns me a new IP. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. So therefore the port is on the wrong IP everytime. Any ideas? Im running a 508 Bulby based off mezzy-scape if it matters. (Still in the works but I was looking to get the server stuff done) 

Thanks in advance.
