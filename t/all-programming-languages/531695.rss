    <description>So, I&#39;ve been registered and watching these forums for years and years to come. That&#39;s not why I&#39;m here though, I have consistently wanted to learn how to program in one specific language and be talented at it. I have come to the conclusion, as I just keep hopping around languages, I want Mopar to decide which language I try to stick to. I don&#39;t want to hear &quot;Which ever language you&#39;re most interested in&quot;. I want your alls opinions. I&#39;m into Rsps coding, somewhat know C++, and used to hack a while back if that information helps you choose at all, thanks for your time!</description>

C is a shit starting language. It might help you understand how programs actually run, but there are so many caveats to catch you out. Learning programming is hard enough as it is without having to worry about shit like memory management.<br>
[/quote]<br>
C is one of the easiest languages to pick up and master. Syntax and the standard library is predictable and minimalistic. C has also been around nearly forever in the world on modern computing, thus it can be found almost everywhere. This being said, there are many books and online guides/resources available to those who are interested in learning C. Another implication is C’s maturity: the language has very clearly definied standards that are solidified and standardized within the public domain. If your platform doesn’t have a C compiler, something is VERY wrong.</p>
<p>Caveats? Other than the potential annoyance of endianess I really cannot think of any true caveats. Of course, there are many solutions to the aforementioned including endian.h (<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/endian.3.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/endian.3.html</a>). You mention manual memory management as a big downfall, but I and many seasoned C programmers see it as a huge advantage you usually cannot obtain in a higher-level language. Furthermore, the ‘caveat’ of memory management isn’t much of an issue if you are familiar with the codebase you’re working with: just be careful, follow patterns and debug often (a principle that applies to all languages). Did I mention gdb or valgrind yet, or any of the other tools out there, including static analysers? There are plenty of libraries and tools out there to provide a ‘modern’ experience when programming in C.</p>
<p>Finally, I find it funny you jumped on the anti-C bandwagon, but you didn’t mention C++ (which was mentioned in this thread). If anything, C++ is one of the most inconsistent, caveat-filled complex language ever conceived.[/quote]There is no anti-C bandwagon going on in this thread… also I never said C was shit, I love C and use it all the time.</p>
<p>I’m just saying that I wouldn’t have liked to have learned it as a beginner. When I learned it I already knew a few languages and more about how computers actually work, so it was pretty easy. Yes, the flexibility C provides in terms of memory management is great. I didn’t say that was a bad thing… I just don’t think you should have to know about it when you’re learning to program for the first time.</p>

<p>I think C’s memory management is a big downfall for <span class="bbcode-i">beginners</span> because it appears many beginners don’t understand pointers; a fundamental concept.</p>
<p>C itself is an easy language in terms of the syntax and language itself, but I have a hard time believing it would be generally easy for beginners since it is so fundamental to understand pointers and memory management. But, once those concepts are successfully understood, C is a great language to learn computer science.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Considering most variables within a Java application are a type of pointer (reference), it really shouldn’t be all that hard to pick up. To me such concepts are trivial and straight forward; though, perhaps I am too far removed from the situation to understand a noobie’s plight. Regardless, there are a massive amount resources, so I believe the <code>not understanding</code> argument to be invalid and just a manifestation of laziness.[/quote]<br>
When I learned Java the concept of a pointer/reference was new to me, but Java references made sense and it was easy enough to just visualise it as a magical “box” that you could store stuff in. It’s always there and you can’t do anything silly with it. C lets you do all kinds of crazy shit just by accident, and it’s not intuitive to know what you did wrong <span class="bbcode-i">as a beginner</span>. You can overflow memory, you can store whatever data type you like in any place, you have to worry about the stack… alignment… you pretty much need to know everything about memory management or you’re going to fudge up and it’s not going to be obvious why.</p>
<p>Again, it’s not laziness- there’s a steep learning curve when learning to program and increasing the gradient of the curve just seems pointless. You’re going to end up learning everything eventually so why make it extra difficult? It’s either because you think programming is for the elite or, hopefully, just because you like a challenge. I learn to gain knowledge… life has enough challenges tyvm.</p>

</aside>
<p>do I really have to explain the difference between <span class="bbcode-b">easy</span> and <span class="bbcode-b">easier</span>? every discussion on this site just turns into some shit semantic argument…[/quote]<br>
I think we’re talking about different things.</p>
<p>If you were to jump in at the shallow end with no prior knowledge, pick up a nice high level scripting language, then with a few weeks of work you would probably be reasonable competent and able to solve problems and write half-decent code in your language of choice. There’s nothing wrong with this, and it doesn’t make you a bad person or whatever. Most of us probably started out this way, and it’s not a a terrible way to go about it. All I’m saying is that it isn’t necessarily the best way.</p>
<p>But at some point, you’re going to come up against a problem you can’t solve in your chosen language, or maybe you just want to try a different language. Without a fundamental knowledge of how things work at a low level, you’re going to struggle to pick up or understand new concepts as easily as someone who already grasps the underlying structure of the computer.</p>
<p>My crappy analogy would be learning a new language. Let’s say you know English, and you want to learn Spanish or French. You can pick up a phrase book, and start out that way, soon enough you’ll have enough of an understanding to manage a conversation with a native speaker, but it’s not going to make you a competent linguist by any means. On the other hand, if you want to truly understand languages (for this contrived analogy let’s just assume we’re talking about European languages, most of which are derived from Latin), you’ll want to pick up something low level that will give you a better understanding of how languages work, structure and semantics and all that. With a firm grasp of the basics, you’ll find it a lot easier to pick up a new language, but more importantly you’ll be a competent linguist.</p>
<p>So, the TL;DR of my spiel is: if you don’t know the basics, you’ve no chance of being a truly ‘good’ developer.</p>
<p>As for whether or not C is the best language to learn <em>first</em>, I don’t have any stupid analogies left to make my case, so maybe it’s just a personal preference thing. I certainly wish I had made the effort to learn it when I was just starting out…</p>

It might help you understand how programs actually run, but there are so many caveats to catch you out. Learning programming is hard enough as it is without having to worry about shit like memory management.</p>

What would everyone think about programming iOS games with udk? Any thoughts or opinions on that?<br>

<p>I suggest C. It’s a nice starting point and anything from there on, isn’t too much of a struggle to pick up. There’s a reason majority of Unis choose to start with Java or C. Well most here anyway.[/quote]<br>
I’ve made a web of Languages and how they could profit the learning that I desire. I’m interested with game engines, scripting, and somewhat c++. But somehow I stick to that desire of learning Java. Only problem is, I’m a hands-on learner and Java’s ReallyBigIndex just doesn’t fit with me, any suggestions?</p>
