</aside>
<p>C is one of the easiest languages to pick up and master. Syntax and the standard library is predictable and minimalistic. C has also been around nearly forever in the world on modern computing, thus it can be found almost everywhere. This being said, there are many books and online guides/resources available to those who are interested in learning C.

If your platform doesn’t have a C compiler, something is VERY wrong.</p>
<p>Caveats? Other than the potential annoyance of endianess I really cannot think of any true caveats. Of course, there are many solutions to the aforementioned including endian.h (<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/endian.3.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/endian.3.html</a>). You mention manual memory management as a big downfall, but I and many seasoned C programmers see it as a huge advantage you usually cannot obtain in a higher-level language. Furthermore, the ‘caveat’ of memory management isn’t much of an issue if you are familiar with the codebase you’re working with: just be careful, follow patterns and debug often (a principle that applies to all languages). Did I mention gdb or valgrind yet, or any of the other tools out there, including static analysers? There are plenty of libraries and tools out there to provide a ‘modern’ experience when programming in C.</p>
<p>Finally, I find it funny you jumped on the anti-C bandwagon, but you didn’t mention C++ (which was mentioned in this thread). If anything, C++ is one of the most inconsistent, caveat-filled complex language ever conceived.<br>

<p>I think C’s memory management is a big downfall for <span class="bbcode-i">beginners</span> because it appears many beginners don’t understand pointers; a fundamental concept.</p>
<p>C itself is an easy language in terms of the syntax and language itself, but I have a hard time believing it would be generally easy for beginners since it is so fundamental to understand pointers and memory management. But, once those concepts are successfully understood, C is a great language to learn computer science.[/quote]<br>
Considering most variables within a Java application are a type of pointer (reference), it really shouldn’t be all that hard to pick up. To me such concepts are trivial and straight forward; though, perhaps I am too far removed from the situation to understand a noobie’s plight. Regardless, there are a massive amount resources, so I believe the <code>not understanding</code> argument to be invalid and just a manifestation of laziness.</p>

<p>I’m just saying that I wouldn’t have liked to have learned it as a beginner. When I learned it I already knew a few languages and more about how computers actually work, so it was pretty easy. Yes, the flexibility C provides in terms of memory management is great. I didn’t say that was a bad thing… I just don’t think you should have to know about it when you’re learning to program for the first time.</p>

When I learned Java the concept of a pointer/reference was new to me, but Java references made sense and it was easy enough to just visualise it as a magical “box” that you could store stuff in. It’s always there and you can’t do anything silly with it. C lets you do all kinds of crazy shit just by accident, and it’s not intuitive to know what you did wrong <span class="bbcode-i">as a beginner</span>. You can overflow memory, you can store whatever data type you like in any place, you have to worry about the stack… alignment… you pretty much need to know everything about memory management or you’re going to fudge up and it’s not going to be obvious why.</p>
<p>Again, it’s not laziness- there’s a steep learning curve when learning to program and increasing the gradient of the curve just seems pointless. You’re going to end up learning everything eventually so why make it extra difficult? It’s either because you think programming is for the elite or, hopefully, just because you like a challenge. I learn to gain knowledge… life has enough challenges tyvm.</p>
