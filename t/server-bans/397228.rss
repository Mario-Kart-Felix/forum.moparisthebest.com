    <title>Server bans</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-bans/397228</link>
    <description>Am I the only one to realize what has gone wrong here? Half the server have left because of the downtime, and the other half are banned. We can&#39;t help downtime but we can help the harshness of bans. People are being banned for ridiculous amounts of time.

(Anthony) is an example, his ban was 2 months? The people who are banned on this server all go on strict IRC and wait to play other servers, if anything we need to be decreasing the harshness of bans and the amount at this time. 

(Anthony) being banned for that long was a huge over reaction. There are literally 4 active players now, this can be increased again if we just give people a second chance, and don&#39;t be as harsh.

Suggest: review of all bans, length, and time. A ton of people have been banned without even being posted so that&#39;s not gonna do much good.

yes this is a mad rant thread</description>

<p>So you’re keeping him banned for 2 months? Also, I’m sure I remember PMing you about the server disconnecting me once saying ‘you’re moving to fast’? If that wasn’t to combat people moving to fast then I don’t understand what its purpose was.</p>
<p>It was just the one of occasion I believe where it went wrong.</p>
<p>Also, I think we’ve agreed on guidelines? Unless some people haven’t.</p>

<p>In my view it should be: NO ban, and the plugin reinstated.</p>
<p>(Anthony) was one of the most active players, banning people isn’t always the way forward. Now nobody plays. Most people won’t do anything wrong again after a short ban. All I’m trying to do is get the server active again.</p>

<p>he used a speedhack which is against rules as you would know(it is detectable i dont know why it wasnt this time)and then instead of accepting it or complaining on forums he found it right to make over 10 new accounts so you know im right here speedhack is detectable so it is against rules</p>

<p>Or more to the point, how can you be sure? It’s not like you can surely detect it like griefing. I though someone was cheating once with these things, I was wrong.</p>

<p>People constantly ask if xray, custom texture packs, etc are allowed on the server.  And my constant answer is that if I can’t detect them, I’m not going to make a rule about them, that would be stupid[/quote]</p>
<p>He was also doing nothing to conflict with other rules, so I don’t understand what’s so wrong with it. Either way his ban needs shortening, my vote is still with a last warning.</p>
