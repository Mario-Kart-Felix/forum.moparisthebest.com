    <description>Hey I&#39;ve decided to start my own server. I have been on a few development teams. I&#39;m not all that great of a coder

I have a fernan scape project I&#39;m doing right now I&#39;v been working on it for a week or so now i haven&#39;t gotten all that far with it so far. I&#39;m trying to take this as far as i can But theres a few things i need

1. A Coder that will help me
2. Someone thats good at making forums.
3. possibly a Hoster i&#39;m not sure yet.
4. And a some staff members.

I don&#39;t have any pictures right now because like i said i haven&#39;t really gotten all that far.

If you would like to help add my msn it&#39;s basherf1@live.com Just add me and tell me what position you want.</description>
