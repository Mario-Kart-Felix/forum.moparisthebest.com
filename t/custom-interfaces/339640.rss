    <title>Custom Interfaces</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-interfaces/339640</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve recently been taking a lot of work into developing a 317 old school server. The furthest customs items go is: Crossbows and Metal Bolts. It&#39;s taken me a while to get everything basically 100% as I like to finish what I start before moving onto something else.

Now for my metal bolts and crossbows, I have a feeling that many people are going to be requesting enchanted bolts and enchantments. I like things to be 100% so I&#39;ve been taking a look into custom interfaces and wondering what I would need to get my magic interface to look like this:

This is the closest I could find to it but.. It was a version before this.

Then for a separate interface like this.
