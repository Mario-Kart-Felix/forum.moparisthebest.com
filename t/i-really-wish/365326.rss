    <description>Someone would make a PK Server =[ I&#39;m sick of hearing about all these people attempting to make a PK server and it not even going anywhere. I haven&#39;t played a decent server since RSCA P2P, by decent I mean not corrupt by admins/mods and not full of retarded 12 year olds who stake.

SOMEONE HELP.</description>

It was something for fun and experience. Runescape classic and Runescape “2” are pretty much the same game except for a graphics update and game play changes.</p>
<p>I see your arguing about our server. Its funny that nobody knows how the server is going to be except for the staff team. The only thing that has been announced is that we are a “point based server” and the world map.</p>
<p>I dont want to argue you with you. Again I have talked to countless people on the subject of what they want to see in a server. So what do you want to see? What are we not doing correctly? Please describe the perfect pking server (in your eyes). You do not have to do it here. If you want I will talk to you over msn and we can share ideas. My msn is <a href="mailto:crazyonedude@hotmail.com">crazyonedude@hotmail.com</a> if you want to talk about it.</p>

<p>You don’t just put up a server. Administration and leadership has a massive influence over the outcome/success of a server. If you really wanted to make a difference you could fund our project, but I don’t think the best intentions of the RSC community is what you’re really aiming to contribute to.</p>

<p>My point laserline is that u originally wanted to create a rsc server with rs2 features n shit, when ppl said it was stupid and gay you decided to make a pking server. So youll forgive me when i question the quality of ur runescape ‘classic’ pking server.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you think brainstorming as a bad thing where do you think RSC dev is going to be in 5 years? We throw idea’s out there all the time. If it’s discussed and the majority of people agree it would work, then yes, we may hop on the project. You can’t say the quality of our server will be anything less than stellar just because he put a brainstorming topic out there involving RS2.</p>
<p>Along with that, the team of people we have didn’t really back the suggestion, but that’s all it was. A suggestion. I make at least 1 every day. That’s a little something called <span class="bbcode-b">innovation</span>.</p>

<p>If your too busy to code a server then you should be too busy to run a server. Running and maintaining a server is just as time consuming if not more than coding a server imo…</p>

<p>My first intention was pking server. I have always been into pking servers. I wanted to go outside of the box and do stuff never before done just to see how it would work out. If you really think about it. Without runescape “2” what would classic be? Classic would of still been developed and who knows what updates they would of had. Afterall they were planning new skills on classic such as summoning. Is it bad for me to think outside of the box and try something new? Not at all. Yet I am being criticized for it.</p>
<p>The “quality” of the server, go back a few years when runescape classic private servers were at its prime. Everybody misses “those days”. So Ive pulled up a few old sources and looked at things. What made them so damn fun? I have taken players opinions of the situation, of what they would like to see. Instead of posting a topic on mopar asking “what would you like to see?” I talked to players one on one and we all have a pretty good idea of how we want it to be.</p>
<p>Do you not like us? It seems you have something against us?</p>

You’d be surprised. Most rsc players play rs2 as well. Not me personally but most do. I haha’d because with an attitude like yours xent would be wasting his time helping you run a server.</p>
