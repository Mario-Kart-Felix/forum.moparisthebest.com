    <title>Ram</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ram/221549</link>
    <description>Lol, made a few question topics about my new pc already, well now I have another, I found 2x2gigs of ram for like 2$ less then what I paid for my 2x1gigs, and AFAIK 4 gigs is enough to meet any requirement. so i wanna RMA my ram in, I will lose crossfire certified, and I will go from 533mhz to 400, which is ok with me since my proc cant go above like 385 anyways, and I will gain 2 gigs, is it worth the trade? I will also have to send in a rebate via mail, which gives me a 35$ rebate on the new ram, which is what puts it 2$ under my old ram.</description>

              <p>Hmm, well, I am gunna get the ram just because in the long run it saves me cash and the need to update my ram any time soon. I assumed it was the video card that was giving me low fps in crysis, only like 11 or so usually, but I cannot afford to upgrade that atm. But at that poin, and after a minor OC I think this pc will last me quite a while.</p>

              <p>Hiaburi i have 1gig of cheap ram and i can play crysis in medium at 80+fps and high at 30-40fps.  I barely think i’d gain more fps getting more ram, either way 2gig should do you fine, my idle programs use 50% of my ram and i play crysis on about 512megs of ram, seem to run it fine.</p>
<p>Its ur GPU (video card) that cant handle it.</p>

              <p>I am buying the ram because I would like 4 gigs, I started playing crysis recently and I can’t play above low, so I wanna get more ram so I meet the minimum and get a new video card but I am to broke to get a video card so this way i gain a couple bucks and i get all the ram I will ever need. I am sure I want to because of the rebate, it may take awhile but in the end I get my 4 gigs for 2$ less then what I payed for 2gigs</p>

              <p>You should never figure a rebate in when buying somethin. Most of the time they claim you didn’t fill in something and you never get it, and if you do it’ll take a while.</p>
<p>So just think of the rebate as a nice bonus if it works, but don’t buy something because of its rebate.</p>
