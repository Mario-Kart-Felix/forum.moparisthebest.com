    <title>My Server: Recruiting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-server-recruiting/14208</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m recruiting people that are experienced/know a bit about java and could help me make a good pk server.  Also, I ask if you could please have patience, although i&#39;m a fast learner, I have a tendency of getting off topic.  Please and Thanks.

Add my MSN if you would like to help me: stevenashrox@msn.com

P.S. - As I&#39;m quitting real RuneScape, you will be payed 250k real RS GP and Gold-Crowned modship to my server.  Remember, I need someone who is good and can get the job done, I only need 1 person though.  And don&#39;t try and take the job just because you want the GP, do it because you are kind enough to help.</description>
