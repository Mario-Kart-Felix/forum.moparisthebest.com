    <title>[PI]rollback?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-rollback/383232</link>
    <description>Ok my players can play for an hour or so and if the server restarts with an auto-restarter they will rollback to where they started in that hour.
so say it took them in hour to get 90 range, and they start from 1, if the server restarts they would go back to 1.
I have no idea how to fix this but I have pasted the files that i&#39;m pretty sure is needed in paste bin, [url=http://pastebin.com/qcvEMed1]here(config.java),[/url] [url=http://pastebin.com/RgrsCVg2]here(client.java)[/url] and [url=http://pastebin.com/7vSj8wfD]here(playerSave.java)[/url] if anyone can help?thanks.</description>
