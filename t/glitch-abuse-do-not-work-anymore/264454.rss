    <title>GLITCH ABUSE! Do not work anymore</title>

    <description>Want to make sure everyone around you crashes??
Then hit Ctrl+alt+M  to make this sign µ and then hit enter, everyone whit public chat on will crash!
if that do not work use this alt code
[quote=&quot;haticks&quot;]alt + 230 is the alt code.[/quote]

This also works in clan chats!
I bet jagex will fix this veeery fast, so if you want to have some fun, you should do it now!
be smart, don&#39;t use your main!

They are now working on it!

We have a specialist team investigating the issue, and we will let you know if there is any information that needs passing on. 

We are busy right now confirming the problem, and trying to establish the root cause of the crashes, so that we can implement a fix if needed. 

Although we still need to do some investigation, it does seem that the crashes are linked to the public chat function. 

If you have been experiencing crashes, you may find, that switching all chat settings to &#39;off&#39;, will reduce or completely stop the crashes. Although not ideal, this will enable you to keep playing until we fully rectify the issue. 

Finally, as we are fully aware of this issue, there is no need to submit a bug report about these crashes, similarly, there is no need to let us know about this issue on the forums (although we appreciate your help of course!). 

We know this must be very frustrating for you, which is why we are working flat out to put things right! 

Thanks for your patience, 

Steve&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So hurry up and join in on making the game unplayable for all the others :D</description>
