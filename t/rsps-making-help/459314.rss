    <description>Okay so i need help setting up my server. i made one a while back but i forgot some steps like i downloaded a source to work off of but i dont know what to do from here. all i have done so far is download a source, portfoward, made a rule in my firewall, and made a no - ip.... If any one can help me that would be great! Best way to contact me is through skype: Clutch0008

<p>Well why don’t you just refresh your memory by just reading it over it once, its better to have actually learnt it so that you don’t face any problems later on and so you don’t have to resort to people spoon feeding you.</p>

              <p>I’d advise browsing through the forums, there’s plenty of tutorials which can help you set-up correctly. Also payments aren’t permitted so remove it from your post before a moderator locks the topic, there are plenty of well-experienced people who are willing to help new comers such as yourself; don’t be afraid to ask <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
