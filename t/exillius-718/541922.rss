I will be adding more pics of the server as we go along and a detailed update log of how we are progressing.

As for what you should expect
- Brand New minigame called Extreme wars / and also League Wars its currently being tested with extreme Donators only It will be a public game in no time the main concept of league wars is for different types of cults to fight eachother also known as Leages Join 1 of your favourite Gods guilds and wreak havoc all over, spread your name.

- More prestiges, The higher your prestige the more XP you could gain the faster you could get a 200M XP skill and the more benefits you can acquire.

Lots more to come Visit the website for more details

<p>Using Roma 718 as our base and building our way up from there. Although I dont expect anyone to see it as full dungeoneering yet. I want to further expand it we need more rooms within each floor and I need to make all types of bosses apear for each type of floor. Right now each floors consists of just 3 rooms and a boss room with minimal equipment and 1 boss per floor only. No where near complete if you get my point.</p>
<p>btw did you delete me from skype or did i delete you i dont even know cause i was looking at my skype  seeing who to add into my skype chat for advertising lol</p>
