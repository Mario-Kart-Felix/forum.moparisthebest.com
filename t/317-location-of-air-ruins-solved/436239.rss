    <title>[317] Location of Air Ruins [SOLVED]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-location-of-air-ruins-solved/436239</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not sure if this should be here or client help. As it&#39;s to do with finding something while using the client but before coding the behind-the-scenes part of it in the server.

I can&#39;t find the air ruins West of Varrock. Are they in a different place in the 317 client? Where exactly should I be looking. Does anyone have coords?

[b]EDIT:[/b] Found old coordinates to them. Solved!</description>
