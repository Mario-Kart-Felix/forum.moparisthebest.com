    <description>Hi there,

Its been a long time since i last been on the Mopar forums and even a long time since i last designed a RSC world.
I just have a few easy questions where i probally already have the answers for, but i&#39;d like to make sure i am correct.

Best &quot;Stable&quot; emulator : RSCA/RSCD or EasyRSC?
Best emulator to start all over again? ( World/Quests ) : RSCA/RSCD or EasyRSC?
Best web intergrated emulator : RSCA/RSCD or EasyRSC?

And possable download links to :
Map editor,
Sprite editor,
RSCA emulator,

Extra usefull programs i might not have posted.

Thanks, Royal.</description>

              <p>CodeForFame,</p>
<p>Your right about all of those things. The more I look at MoparRSC, the more I like it. It is my goal to take a server base, delete all of the game content, and create a new game while using the engine. I am not ready yet to code an engine from scratch so I am sticking with what I am familiar with. I want to document every step of the game content creation along with how the game engine works and open it to the public under the same open source design as MoparRSC and DarkQuest. Many people would like to learn the different aspects of game design and programming but the curve is still pretty steep and a project like that could be fairly popular.</p>

The Moparscape forum authentication looks done but I have not yet figured out how to test it with a SMF installation. There is a lot of room for plugins to be added. DarkQuest has a great deal in terms of listeners (action and executive), minigames, quests, and skills. I am not yet sure if they are compatible or at least similar yet. The npchandler folder contains duplicates of many of the NPC BSH scripts from looking at it, maybe they interact with them, I don’t know yet. Those could be either completely BSH or made into NPC plugins that interact with the listeners as they are in DarkQuest. The skills plugin folder contains the mining skill but there are several more that can be added. DarkQuest has 9 plugin skills total. MoparRSC still utilizes XML for the game server NPC/Item defs and locs, objects, doors, and shops. DarkQuest moved all of that into MySQL and being able to manipulate the data with a website has utility.</p>
<p>Overall the additions that you contributed to MoparRSC are spot on but the RSCA source feels a whole lot more rough compared to the changes Peeter made to it with DarkQuest. If you were to take DarkQuest (pre-revision 70’s points system) and made the same changes… rawr.[/quote]The alert system isn’t to spam the shit out of everyone on it, it’s for important things.  If you have suggestions of what to add I’m all ears, but I really don’t see what else should be added.</p>
<p>You need to write a php page that either accepts or denies the credentials (essentially displays true or false).  You don’t even need to integrate it with SMF, because there is nothing SMF specific.</p>
<p>The plugin system is garbage, and there really isn’t a valid reason to re-write the skills and make them plugins.  Skills are rarely changed, and don’t really fit the nature of plugins, because they’re core content.</p>
<p>Duplicates of many NPC BSH scripts?  I see one, and that’s Aggie.  In addition, they work just fine.  I’d like to re-do the system completely, but that’s a lot of work and I really don’t have time right now.</p>
<p>Manipulating that data isn’t really beneficial…  It’s not like people are going to be moving absolutely everything around on a consistent basis.  It’s better served in compressed XML files.</p>
<p>I’ve toyed around with DarkQuest and it’s just as rough in most places.  Things he implemented were on the right track, but still nowhere near polished.</p>

Use the forum search to find the things you need.

              <p>with the DarkQuest source, it may be better but it’s also never really been tested properly. i believe as Peter was building it, it hardly got tested on a live server? so you may be prone to issues.</p>

              <p>Look at the DarkQuest source too. I really like the MoparRSC source but it is still a work in progress and the client is not finished yet. Use the forum search to find the things you need. They have all been posted again recently with working links.</p>
