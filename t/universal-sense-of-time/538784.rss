    <title>Universal sense of time?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/universal-sense-of-time/538784</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;ve always been wondering why, for example, when there is an awkward pause in a conversation, two or more people suddenly speak at one time. Is this because our universe has a &quot;tick&quot; system like RuneScape? Leave your opinions below :)</description>

Time is relative to different points and conditions in the universe. Albert Einstein’s Theory Of Relativity states that if your moving at the speed of light time can’t directly affect you.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Velocity is measured between two objects, not as a universal constant. When you think you’re moving (at a constant velocity), it isn’t you that move, but everything else.[/quote]<br>
Depends on your frame of reference. And I would even go as far to say that velocity isn’t measured between two objects but between to objects with respect to the speed of light. If it was simply two objects I could have a train traveling at 60 miles per hour on top of a train traveling 60 miles per hour in the same direction an infinite amount of times and if you measured the last trains speed with respect to the ground you would think that the last train would have an infinite speed, but it doesn’t as nothing can go faster than the speed of light. I’m sure you know all this I’m just expanding on what you wrote. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I would also like to point out you cannot travel at the speed of light as it would take an infinite amount of energy.</p>

<p>I know that time isn’t real. Time is the reason used to explain the aging, changing, and death (for living things) of everything in the universe. The reason why things ‘age’ and get ‘destroyed’ is because something goes wrong because of CHANCE. The chance that the sun will explode (I’m just making up a ratio) is 1:2,000,000,000,000,000. Eventually, as the process to keep the sun alive continues to loop, chance for error increases, and therefore the sun explodes from pure chance. The only reason why living things have a life span is because living cells get weaker and tired resulting in a higher chance of failure, and since most (if not all) living things are composed of systems that rely on one another, if one organ or cell loses function, the entire living thing dies. According to my theory, we can die at any time naturally, it’s only because our cells are still new and healthy we live to be many years old.[/quote]<br>

Uhm no. Just no. Our cells dying is essential for us to live. If your cells did not die then you could not heal. Cell death is good. The problem is when cells can no longer divide because the telomeres are degraded from mitosis. <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101128/full/news.2010.635.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101128/full/news.2010.635.html</a></p>
<p>Maybe our concept of length of time is made up, but time is definitely not made up. Space and time both exist and are both dimensions. The sun won’t explode from chance and I have no idea where you heard that from.<br>
