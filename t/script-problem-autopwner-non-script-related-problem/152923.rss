    <title>Script Problem (AutoPwner) &amp; non script related problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/script-problem-autopwner-non-script-related-problem/152923</link>
    <description>Here is the topic to the script I am using: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,168768.0.html

It seems like an excellent script, but every once in awhile it logs out and says next player in the scar window. I just want to use it on one character, but cannot figure it out. If anyone knows how to I&#39;d appreciate the help.

My other problem is randoms. I have the newest Scar Devi 3.12 or w/e. I have the latest SRL. Mind you, I haven&#39;t ever autoed on rs2 prior to a couple days ago using scar. Last time I autoed was about 5 years ago on rsc. I thought I downloaded all the includes I needed, but if anyone could help me set it up so all randoms are covered? I seen it solve the box random, but sandwich lady and the drill instructor it did not solve.</description>
