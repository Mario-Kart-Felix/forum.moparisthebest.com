    <title>Hitmarkers - deathlypvpzv3</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hitmarkers-deathlypvpzv3/540981</link>
    <description>I already used google to try and find a tut to adding hitmarker splats but i cant find anything. Base is deathlypvpzv3 and only numbers show up no red or blue background  When i used to work on servers was when silab was around so i never really messed with clients.  I know it has to be added as a sprite but now the coding so that sprite is loaded when needed is my problem.  Can anyone either explain what class (server/client/both) would i need to edit/add to to make this show up or please direct me to a tutorial on how to do this? Thanks!</description>
