              <p>If you want to do everything your self it’s worth not using the WWW files and just making your own, and bridging it with whatever you want (PHPBB, VBB, FluxBB… whatever) as I think they have security holes in them (what I’ve read some time ago).</p>
<p>If you want to login and fuck around, just download that EasyRSC sticky, everyone says that’s simple.</p>
