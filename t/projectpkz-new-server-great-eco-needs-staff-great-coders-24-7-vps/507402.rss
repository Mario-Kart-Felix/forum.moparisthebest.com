You&#39;re probably thinking, &quot;What&#39;s so good about Project PKz that makes it worth playing?&quot;
The playing experience is like none other. We here at Project PKz want to make your time 
here well worth playing, there are plenty of rare items to get your hands on and this is 
where we are different, like no other. The rares will only be tradable to one another and 
can not be gained any other way! This means once we have given out Partyhats or Masks that 
will be it!

There will also be another similar drop party that will have the special trimmed armour and 
holiday items up for grabs! The ultimate private server with the rares around that will 
encourage everyone to work there way up to getting all the rares they can get.

We also have some of the best Donation deals around and the best part is you can either pay 
using real life money or you can pay with rsgp! 

There is nothing like Project PKz so don&#39;t waste your time with other servers, come and join 
PROJECT PKZ today!
