    <title>Server status page suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-status-page-suggestion/392394</link>
    <description>I think we should be able to add feedback to a server on the status page if you fit certain requirements, like being here for 2 months or something.
Just for the hell of it, I decided to try out a server. I wasn&#39;t gonna do to much, so I found a 525 purely pvp, get 2 drops from a kill, ect.
Here is my experience:

I login to be met by about 7 players, 3 of which are staff. First that happens is admin teleports us all to jad without warning. I almost die, barely get out. Dick move.
So I&#39;m slowly pking, trying to earn cash and items so I can get better armor. Some noob logs in and keeps saying &quot;50m plz&quot;.
The admins then spawn him full bandos, ags, d claws, etc. Pretty rediculous, considering I&#39;ve been working my ass off to get kills for the past 35 minutes.
Later, some guy keeps telling me to stop &quot;rushing&quot;. To me, rushing is charging up to someone, firing some kinda magic shit, then doing like a d claw spec. I walk over to him, stood there for a good 4 seconds, then used a dds spec.
He goes and starts bitching, and I say &quot;dude, chill out it&#39;s only a game. I rarely play p servers, I don&#39;t care what I do.&quot;
As a result, the owner then mutes me. That was rediculous. I didn&#39;t do anyhing, you jerk. So I try to keep playing for a bit.
The owner then teleports everyone into lvl 55 wildy, and we cant teleport out. Alot of us die, I manage to run to magebank.
Owner teleports everyone to wilderness again. More casualties.
Later, one of the admins is like &quot; I bet reyx7 is just &quot;1 h1t u&quot;, you should probably IP him. With no questions, I&#39;m IPed.


Now, I would LOVE to write a review on the status page about how the staff are jerks and how it&#39;s shittily coded (most npcs cant do anything, meleeing doesn&#39;t auto follow)
But, unfortunately, I can&#39;t.
so, anyone else support the idea?</description>
