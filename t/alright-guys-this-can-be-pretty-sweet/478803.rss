    <description>I DONT KNOW IF THIS IS AGAINST THE RULES, IF IT IS I&#39;LL DELETE THE THREAD IMMEDIATELY (I DONT SEE ANY FORUM RULES SO PLEASE CORRECT ME)

Alright guys theres this new app on the appstore called &quot;bamboo wallet&quot; that you get cash for simple stuff like downloading apps or watching videos, and it&#39;s not bs amounts like 2 cents, they give you .50 cents just for download an app. When you invite someone you get $0.50, and when someone signs up using any invite code, they get a $0.25 head start. My idea is that in this thread you use the invite code of the person who posted above you, so we can get some easy invites/profits from this thread. My code is * (enter it when you download and sign up for $0.25 headstart). This isn&#39;t bs they even tell you that you get .25 for using an invite code

ONCE AGAIN IF THIS IS AGAINST THE RULES PLEASE TELL ME, I JUST THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA</description>

<p>I’m not entirely sure if this is directly in breach of the selling/buying/money exchange rule thing but the rules are just guidelines so it’ll probably be locked.</p>
