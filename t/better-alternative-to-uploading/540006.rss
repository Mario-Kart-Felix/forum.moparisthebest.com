    <title>Better Alternative to Uploading?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/better-alternative-to-uploading/540006</link>
    <description>I probably already know the answer to this question, but.

Does anyone know a better alternative to uploading? My upload speed is absolute trash, and I don&#39;t want to wait an hour and thirty minutes for an upload to complete. Dropbox/any file sharing utensil in that manner is the same thing, so if you&#39;ve got that in mind - don&#39;t say it.

Edit:
A simple &#39;no&#39; will suffice enough for me. Though, if you know one, please tell me!</description>

If you’re uploading files online for everybody to access on the internet, your only option is to get better speed or “borrow” somebody else’s.</p>

It’s been over 1 hour and 30 minutes by now. The upload should be finished.<br>

What exactly are you uploading?<br>
[/quote]A zip file.<br>
[/quote]So you want to upload without uploading? Lol. There is no other option but to upgrade your upload speed.<br>
[/quote]Lol, yeah that’s why I said I probably already know the answer. I was just wondering if there was some way to like immediately transfer a file from host to host.[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh sure, the bandwidth fairies will transfer anything you need ASAP.</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, if you live in a somewhat crowded part of a city, you can go ahead and buy a wifi pci card and pray that your neighbors are dumb enough to not have locked their wifi, but if there are no wifi signals, just return the product.</p>
<p>Can’t lose. Fool proof plan. Much success. So wifi. Many upload.</p>
<p>And no, there is no immediate file-to-file transfer.<br>
Everything on the internet is download/upload speed-dependent.</p>
