    <title>Creating ints?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-ints/250898</link>
    <description>Okay so I took a model from Runescape&#39;s cache, gzipped it, put in my models folder, add models... and so on.  I tried creating the ints for it but when I logged on it turned out very different.  It was supposed to be the Lunar staff but I showed up as a gauge kinda thing.  Could someone make the ints for me? [code]    if(i == 9084) {
        class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
        class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Wield&quot;;//New option
        class8.anInt181 = 2000; //zoom increase will make it smaller
        class8.anInt190 = 572; //model rotate up+down increase to move doen away from you
        class8.anInt198 = 0; //model rotate side ways increase to move right in circle
        class8.anInt169 = 25; // model offset increase to move to the right
        class8.anInt194 = 1; //model offset increase to move up
        class8.anInt165 = 9084;//male wearing //
        class8.anInt200 = 9084;//female wearing // 
        class8.anInt164 = -1;//Female arms/sleeves //
        class8.anInt188 = -1;//male arms/sleeves // 
        class8.aBoolean176 = false;//Stackable
        class8.aString170 = &quot;Lunar staff&quot;;//Name of the new item
        class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;A Moonclan staff.&quot;.getBytes();//examin info
    }[/code]  This was my failed attempt to make a Lunar staff. Help please!</description>
