    <title>Router stopped forwarding ports... (SOLVED)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/router-stopped-forwarding-ports-solved/346404</link>
    <description>Yup, was my firewall. I had to update it as well though for some reason.

This is not something MPSC related, I&#39;m trying to do this to host my website. The problem is, the port is forwarded to my computer, yes. I&#39;m starting to wonder, if it is possible that my Firewall is blocking stuff coming in from that port, but while I look into that, I am hoping to get more suggestions about what it could be. Here are 2 pictures so you know its port-forwarded to my comp.
