    <title>Server Discussion Forum?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-discussion-forum/396578</link>
    <description>Hello :P

I came onto MoparScape and wanted to discuss something I found in the Runescape Private Server protocol, however, there was no section for it. The only section it would be remotely close to falling in would be general programming, but that section prohibits the talk of Runescape Private Servers.

So i&#39;m asking, why isn&#39;t there a Server Discussion forum for people to collaborate about Runescape Private Servers? Correct me if i&#39;m wrong.</description>
