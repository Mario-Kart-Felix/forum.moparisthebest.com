    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-about-using-someone-as-a-host-please-thanx/72434</link>
    <description>Ok then i want to have my server hosted, however i need to know if this is correct:

Would i delete all java files and the compiler, and &#39;hide&#39; (using right click and clicking on properties) all other files appart from the runserver.bat and mabey a littler note to the guy whos hosting the server?

Please tell me if that is what i need to do, if not what do i need to do?

Also im on no-ip, so do i keep my server IP and just put my hosts IP in the IP Address box, or does the guy need to have the no-ip IP on his no-ip account?

Thanx</description>
