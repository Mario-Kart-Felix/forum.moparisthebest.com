We believe in the journey

About Variation.
We started this server over a couple of years ago.
Me and my best friend had been playing Runescape for over 6  years and we thought since there were so many people making private servers we made one ourselves.
So we did after a couple of weeks of struggling we got our own server!
We were very excited to launch the server but there weren’t much opportunities for us to grow big.
So after a couple of months we shut the server down and we were pissed.
But after all that we now finally decided to laugh up again with a better hosting program and with way more coding skills.  


Why should you play Variation?


I like to start off by saying we are very friendly and willing to help at all time.
We make sure that the players get what they want.
Such as updates and bug fixes.
Since it’s a small server we want to get as much attention as we can so there will be a lot of events going on in the near future.
Me and my best friend (in game name Chewy) Hope to see you very soon!
