    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-sorta-ivy-league-questions-helppp/447499</link>
    <description>alright 2 decent questions... 

my dark bow doesnt have a special bar, and i know ive played around with a spec before on 317 servers, which was easy and all i did add was made the spec out of 20. and on this 474 i have no idea. so help please?

also..i forgot my 2nd question but i wouldve had a 3rd... so here it is.

can you tell me the exact files to locate where i can make a bow, thats normally not already used as a bow. like the training bow, it shoots like a bow, equips like a bow, but it doesnt consume the arrows like a bow. :(</description>
