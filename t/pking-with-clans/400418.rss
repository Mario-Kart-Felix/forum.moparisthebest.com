    <title>Pking with clans</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pking-with-clans/400418</link>
    <description>I never really been into clans, I only been in one and that was in rsc 2004. I have not chosen to join any even though I still remember that clans name. Now I find close to 0 appeal to pk on my 40 1 99, since castle pking is dead and the only way to pk is in level 3 and down against a bunch of noobs and my lack of def doesn&#39;t allow for me to deep wild pk. So my question to you guys is if you guys enjoy clan pking? also where would I find a clan? I looked the other day over a tip.it and that place seems dead.</description>
