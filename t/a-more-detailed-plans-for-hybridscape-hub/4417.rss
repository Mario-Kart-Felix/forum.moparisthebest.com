    <description>
Server Owners:
--PHP control of their users account
--PHP control of their server config file (this will help stop source leeching, i have a good idea on how to set this up)
--PHP control of their server page including signuppage (sure will give them alittle webspace and will slap a yahoo on their to pay for the hosting)
--PHP sending ingame message to users (im writing a beta as we speek)
--PHP sending to message centre (couldnt be that hard)
--PHP control of their out of game shops - a little idea im still brainstorming..

Server users:
--PHP limited control of their account
--PHP ability to send message to other users of a server cost a ingame gold fee(writing beta)
--PHP ability to buy ingame items offline - idea im still brainstorming..

Hybridscape admin panel:
--Access to logs
--Ability to terminate server accounts
--ability to ban delete abusive players


I allready have serverspace ready for testing and i got a temperary address of fssah.com which will become hybridscape.com if i can get this developed :)

obiously will throw up a small forum and some other little features all linking back here to moparisthebest.com

another small thing we can do possibly if all devs agree (after we get a dev list) is add addon packs and advert free hosting of server pages we could charge a small fee for such items and what dosnt get used in hosting cost(i doubt much would) will be split amongs devs if all agree.  my guess is that the yahoo adds and donate button will be enough to cover hosting so that might leave us with 10 15 dollars each a month which i wouldnt complain its better than nada :p


other notes: php dosnt have to be the set language i just think that would be easier than using java apps. and its the next language i have any experience in =p


what we also need is a checklist of people to be apart of project hybridscape hub

rictoo - not sure
miss silabsoft - yup
fasga -  yup
moparisthebest - yup
l3etal3lade - not sure
newbiehacker - yup
kmb - not sure
calvin - dont know where he went

and we need to look for someone thats decent in php unless 1 of us are :) im thinking sppt but im sure some of you have some names






Now here is some more words as i continue to think. yes this can be done fairly painlessly if u noticed the current version of hybridscape i have release access stuff from the internet the hybridscape server which is my computer to be exact :p its not that hard to do.

Of course we have to focus on ingame content such as skill handling but will make it simpiler to script and more broken down no more huge client.java.. currently i have my client.java broken down to a 200k file and thats with the skills still installed on it =p

with centralisation we can complete online server to server pm as well as some other sync of data :)


my ideas on connecting: client hides the address to the main server and we have people only type in what game they want to join so lets say we get a client silabsoft with pass abacabb joining game silabscape the main server will see silabsoft abacabb and silabscape and would check the silabscape folder for the character silabsoft and the pass abacabb if it returns true it will add a online user to the array in the main server and send the connection to the owners server


will this allow server programmers still be able to access character files if they need to save ints and stuff to the file?: yes we will create i game save folder specific for all the addon stuff server developers may wish to add we do not want to limit them in the least :) i simply want a better way to traffic servers and clients[br][size=1]Posted at: July 05, 2006, 12:18:59 pm[/size][hr]Ideas with the addons: for example if we wrote a small minigame and we sold it to a user they would buy it and we would go into their account info and set a boolean to true and their config.class will allow them to use the mini game :p</description>

<p>and we need to look for someone thats decent in php unless 1 of us are <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> im thinking sppt but im sure some of you have some names</p>
<p>Now here is some more words as i continue to think. yes this can be done fairly painlessly if u noticed the current version of hybridscape i have release access stuff from the internet the hybridscape server which is my computer to be exact <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> its not that hard to do.</p>
<p>Of course we have to focus on ingame content such as skill handling but will make it simpiler to script and more broken down no more huge client.java… currently i have my client.java broken down to a 200k file and thats with the skills still installed on it =p</p>
<p>with centralisation we can complete online server to server pm as well as some other sync of data <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>my ideas on connecting: client hides the address to the main server and we have people only type in what game they want to join so lets say we get a client silabsoft with pass abacabb joining game silabscape the main server will see silabsoft abacabb and silabscape and would check the silabscape folder for the character silabsoft and the pass abacabb if it returns true it will add a online user to the array in the main server and send the connection to the owners server</p>
<p>will this allow server programmers still be able to access character files if they need to save ints and stuff to the file?: yes we will create i game save folder specific for all the addon stuff server developers may wish to add we do not want to limit them in the least <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> i simply want a better way to traffic servers and clients[br][size=1]Posted at: July 05, 2006, 12:18:59 pm[/size][hr]Ideas with the addons: for example if we wrote a small minigame and we sold it to a user they would buy it and we would go into their account info and set a boolean to true and their config.class will allow them to use the mini game <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
