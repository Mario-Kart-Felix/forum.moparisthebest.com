    <title>Oops .jar help (made it more legible) added more information</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/oops-jar-help-made-it-more-legible-added-more-information/456726</link>
    <description>I removed the numbers from the java version folder; so instead of like &quot;jre1.2&quot; as the folder name, it is just &quot;jre&quot; now, and I tried opening .jars with .javaw, .javac and .java in the bin folder of each jdk and jre and it doesnt work. How can I fix this? and yes i forgot my jre and jdk versions already

more info: every single question ive asked here has never been answered, i am guessing too advance questions? i have never asked to be spoon feed just pointed in the right direction but most people on here seem to only answer the &quot;run.bat&quot; type questions.</description>
