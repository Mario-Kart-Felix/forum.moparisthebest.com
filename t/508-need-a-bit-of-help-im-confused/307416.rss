    <title>[508] Need a bit of help, im confused</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-need-a-bit-of-help-im-confused/307416</link>
    <description>I am trying to add custom items to my server. I know there are tutorials for this, but they just confused me.

(Im using davidscapes source)

I have downloaded the new corrupted pvp armors from tatemo...... but i dont know where to place the 12999 - 13046.gz files. and then after i have done that, is that all i have to do? do i need to add code somewhere else, and if so, where?

(i know this is a big request, but if you can find the time to help me, it would be much appreciated.)</description>
