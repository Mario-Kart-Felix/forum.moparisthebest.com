    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-eclipse-source-639-req/434978</link>
    <description>Does anyone have a working Eclipse Source 639 with Nex, Nomad and Summoning? I really need it bad because the source I currently have doesnt have nex, nomad and I dont know how to add it, I have the files to add it, but don&#39;t know how. Or you could tell me how to add it.

Thanks.</description>
