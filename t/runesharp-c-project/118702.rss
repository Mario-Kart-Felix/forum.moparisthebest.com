    <title>RuneSharp, C# Project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runesharp-c-project/118702</link>
    <description>I have started a new project from nothing.

[b]First a little bit about the server.[/b]

It will be coded in C#.
It will be 100% my coding, except references off google. And some packet references from Silabs tutorials, and out of winterloves original release.
It will be a clean source.

[b]Structure of the server,[/b]

Based around the Server.cs class.
Server.cs will run handlers, will start the Client Handler upon running. And all other handlers.

Not sure how to handle the packets. Might make a packet handler like the RSCD server? Need ideas about this though.

[b]Expectations of the server,[/b]

I just want to make a basic server. With combat, skill, item, and npc handling. Just so people have a good base to make there own server.

[b]Development,[/b]

I have only just started developing the server, and have only just about finished the Server class.

I will not have a development team, other then a few close friends or people i know can code to the standerds i want this server. (If you can code please post)

[b]Hosting,[/b]

I will never host the server from my computer. Except for testing, and beta testers.
I will however host my own website, and maybe host my own forums from my computer. 

[b]Final, [/b]

Once i have the server to my expectations it will be realsed for all to run there own C# based server.


I will update this post with my updates.
Ask any questions and i will be happy to reply asap.

And if you can offer to host me a website and fourms i would be greatfull. 

Thanks for reading. If you support please make sure you post.
