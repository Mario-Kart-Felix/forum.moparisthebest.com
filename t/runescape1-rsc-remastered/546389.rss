    <title>RuneScape1\RSC &quot;Remastered&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape1-rsc-remastered/546389</link>
    <description>Greetings MoparScape,
     Before I Introduce myself, I have skimmed through recent threads and I am quite stunned at the amount of progress RuneScape Classic .Dev has evolved over the years.  However, I am also disappointed at the community count. People have their own reasons for having interests in a game they favor and I have always favored RuneScape for many reasons. I could get all emo for you readers and tell my life story and all but that wouldn&#39;t exactly be a great first impression, now would it? If that was the case I probably wouldn&#39;t be making my first post in the RSC Server Development thread - which submits to one clue; but we haven&#39;t gotten that far yet. 
  
    Yes- full of surprises am I not? Okay so lets get back to the viewpoint..

   The reason why I&#39;m here is to simply take part of RuneScape Classic Development. However I am not writing or changing bits of code in java. No, that would be silly. I have always pictured more from RuneScape1 (or RSC- from now on ill just call it RS1, whether u like it or not) &amp;&amp; I&#39;m not just talking about new skills.. or new colored party hats, you get the idea. 

      I&#39;m really here to just share ideas, consider this page my new home blog to type whatever I want with no care in the world besides the rules that MoparScape embedded in my registration page. But here&#39;s the twist: When I post or blog about my ideas or RS1 philosophy, I will also post updates on the client &amp; server I am developing from scratch. As of now it&#39;s really nothing to showcase. I&#39;ve been working on it for about a week now. I could show you screenshots and you&#39;d laugh with your already functioning game and trust me, I would too if I were you. However this is more of a learning experience for me, nothing more- nothing less.

Well I was going to write about myself just a bit, however I am more interested in showing you just a peak what I&#39;ve done in a whole week. and here is the screen shot:

[img]http://s24.postimg.org/j0wgaru79/rs1.png[/img]

Go head- laugh; its funny right. In a whole week I made a few buttons, right? Well actually, no. It takes a whole lot more than pixel drawing to create a fully functional game. But that&#39;s all you get to see for now. So you may have noticed a few things in the screenshot- if the bbc code worked. I have created a fully functional Framework written in C++ to fulfill [b]all[/b] my development needs. Oh. Disregard the lines, they are just helping my OCD align stuff like those buttons.. But anyway, I&#39;m really excited to be doing this project. I haven&#39;t really came to conclusions with a title so I just slapped on RSCHD since I&#39;m working with D3D.

I haven&#39;t actually given any ideas- but that&#39;s okay! there&#39;s always tomorrow.

I hope most of you enjoyed this thread so far!

<p>No, you needn’t say more because you didn’t even need to say that much.<br>
Yea, I have time to waste just like you do, else I wouldn’t be developing for RSClassic.<br>
I was not trying to upset you, I’m simply stating a fact.  The game’s dead, and it’s not ever going to pick back up.<br>
My original post ITT is just pointing out to you, that this is FAR more silly than working with the official Jagex client.  It doesn’t mean that it’s not a cool project; it’s a VERY cool project, in my opinion.  It’s just a redundant project, and I don’t consider it productive if your goal is to replicate RSClassic in its current state, it is literally reinventing the wheel.<br>
However, I know the current RSClassic codebase(the one everyone uses with their private servers, the modified 202) is a mess and has been hacked on by like 10000 different people in the RSClassic private server community, which has created a few bugs and etc, Even if it wasn’t modified by this community, Jagex wrote it to be compatible with JDK1.1 and it’s an incredibly old codebase with a sub-par game engine, so hey, since I’m sure that you’re improving the codebase as you port it, this could very well be a worthwhile project.  I can’t see the codebase you’re creating, so I can’t properly comment, it had just irked me that you said it’s silly to work with the official Jagex client, when it simply makes more sense and cuts out a lot of development time if all you want to do is play RuneScape Classic again, as most people in the community do.</p>
<p>All that said, I also plan on making a port of the RSClassic client, and had already started it a while back, using C99 and SDL, so I understand the motivation behind this project as well.</p>

The leading RSC private servers also have no developers for the most part, so there’s that.<br>
This project and really, anything to do with RSC period, is a waste of time, and telling yourself otherwise because you’re bored and have time to waste isn’t going to make it any less of a wate of time.</p>

RSCR was going for full replica but this community doesnt like that. So why bother making something nobody likes to play.</p>

All of which I know are accomplish-able and time manageable. I have over (probably but maybe) 5 thousand lines on a '.txt' file, ranges from how I should construct each tile, player view depth, monster sprite topology and sprites, 'NPC' behaviors, combat behavior, experience tables, 'skilling' nodes, actual quest and story lines etc. All I have to do is put them into actual code. The only trouble I may run into is getting the combat formula almost precise. 
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s a small sample of how the new engine will now create and display 2d textures, self creating U/V map system using less memory.  The light is only temporary to show the example texture (“3223.png”) being converted and manipulated from the sprites.rscd source into an .obj(v,vn,f,n) and displayed as 3d object without having to actually modify the file itself or hard coding normals.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see what Varrock’s General Store will look like now.</p>
<p>The client now delivers an All-in-one support for D3D 9,10 and 11, OpenGL 1.5+ as well as the RS1HD Software Rendering.<br>

              <pre><code>  I know I am thinking a bit ahead of myself &amp; I'm sure the thought has been around before however I have an idea for creating the  'Slayer' skill to make training combat more "pleasurable" for the PVMers. If it seems too much like RS2 then I could easily integrate a  'task' system. (I.E) The same concept for Slayer on RuneScape2-3 without the leveling system, You go to a "Task-Master" found in every main city (being that every city has that one vacant house makes things just as easy) gives you a (x) task (task selection optional) and you go kill (y) amount of (x) monsters and depending on the task difficulty, your combat level &amp; task bonus for completing the task in a  (p) period of time (To be determined..) you will receive extra gold and experience and have the ability to fight the boss of that task (say if your task is goblins, you will kill the goblin generals. TBD) 
</code></pre>
<p>Not a solid plan but just got the idea- variables everywhere.</p>
<p>A few other ideas gathered- very random/optimistic ideas to sip on.</p>
<p>Guild System:<br>
I don’t care for the “clan” word, to me the word ‘clan’ describes a very small unorganized group. However I’m not going to judge you if you call your posse’ a clan. Anyway, I’m sure this has been brought about somewhere and some time ago. I’m just here to help generalize and help place these ideas into conceptions and well, mainly how I will go about creating this when the time comes and the features I plan on bringing to my project.</p>
<p>Initialization: To create/found your guild you simply hover over the buddy icon and below the ‘Click here to add a friend’ clickable text two options are born. “Click here to create your guild” or simply “Create Guild.” then below that your friends will notice the “search / join guild.”</p>
<p>Create Guild Menu:<br>
<code>Very simple menu , I mean it could practically be the same black box as if you're sending a private message but of course replacing the text, "Enter message to send to so and so" with, "Enter the name of your newly founded guild" or whatever. You get the idea. Then walla- a new guild was born.</code></p>
<p>Join Guild Menu:<br>
I haven’t exactly put much thought into this menu itself however you would want it to consist of the necessities;<br>
<code> 0. Recent Invitations;
      1. Search Bar with criteria (Skilling,Pking,RolePlaying, etc);
      2. Open Public List ( Guild Name, Guild Description, Member Count, (lol, wealth stack,kill count? random features like such);</code></p>
<p>When you have either created or joined a guild, those two clickable texts (create/join guild) magically disappear in replace with the Guild Panel. Members will be allowed to make changes to the guild structure depending on his or her rank and the access level (set by the leader or founder. I will explain more about access level later on.</p>
<p>Guild Panel:</p>
<p>[code]<br>
0. Recent Activities (I.E, TechN9ne was slayed by Red Rooster!; or Red Rooster attained 99 fishing! etc.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Guild Achievements (I.E Fish 50,000 Sharks; or Kill 1,000 Players)</li>
<li>Letterbox (Shoutbox( Need to leave your clan a message? feel free to do so))</li>
<li>Settings -&gt; | Access Levels, Ranks, Description; anything guild editable)</li>
<li>Invite Player<br>
-In example to Access Levels… Say Access Level in a guild was 1-5. 5 being the highest with the most access to the guilds settings and features, most likely the founder or leader. 1 being the lowest, the newly recruited member, not trusted enough to enter the guild’s bank or leave a message on the letterbox. You get the idea. The guild founder will be able to modify the access levels to his or her wishes. So if the access level requirement to put a message on the letterbox was 1, every member could use that feature and so on.[/code]</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t want to get too in depth of my guild system ideas here just yet as I’ve written a lot already however I must at least share some of the main features!</p>
<p>Guild Features:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">0. If a guild has 5 or more members then their guild name will show besides their player name along with combat level 
   [I.E] TechN9ne (Level-120) (Strange Music Inc) (Color optimization in guild panel)
1. Guild achievements will unlock various items (Guild Unlock Only Items) to be purchased through the guild merchant. (Custom Guild Cape (TBD) 
2. Guild Chat: chat for clan members activated by the bottom panel;
All Messages - Chat History - Quest History - &gt;(Guild Chat)&lt; - Private history - Report Abuse
Simply click and type to send [guild] message (or type ::g[uild] TBD) 
-----to be continued
-----------------------</code></pre>
<pre><code> Well going back to the project I have not much to showcase yet, other than a few hard-coded terrain implements, I am working on creating a World Editor to make the process a lot easier for me to generate or create Varrock then I will sync the character data from the registration\login system to the game world and attach the camera to the player character. I will probably create a developer mode to freemove to check for bugs or errors and other fun harry potter stuff.</code></pre>

              <p>So with the registration/login system being ‘almost’ complete (being that the data is stored unto a ‘.ini’ file and not the mysqli server) I am going to go ahead and begin constructing the game world. However, before I do so,(of course) I will need to emulate a “camera.” I’m sure most of you know already the standards so I will generate a quick ‘TODO’ list and come back and  check off everything complete when done so.<br>
I will now be getting into the game world content as shown below. I will have to make two versions of each entity for DirectX Supported Cards and failsafe low version OpenGL.</p>
<p>/*TODO</p>

<li>Rendering Elements</li>
<li>3D Camera</li>
<li>Player Character</li>
<li>Grid System</li>
<li>Terrain Generation</li>

<li>Collision Detection</li>

<li>NPC</li>

<li>Inventory System</li>

<li>Skill System and Experience System</li>

<li>Skill Actions</li>
<li>Combat System<br>
*/<br>
<span class="hashtag">#endif</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t believe one of my previous submissions here were successfully sent, however I have also created a OpenGL game client mainly for Linux users. Although this will also be backend for older graphic cards that do not have DX11 capabilities.</p>
<p>Rodgerwilco: Yes my name is Patrick, however I don’t believe I am who you are referring to.</p>
<p>I wanted to do something different today so going off the list I created Varrock’s General Store. I will be doing a whole lot of terrain placing later on but for now I just wanted to get a feel for it since I am now able to.</p>

<p>I don’t know why but there is a crease in the corner of the roof where it’s not suppose to… None of the other corners are like that just that one… The same “glitch” I found behind RSCRevolution’s Varrock General Store on the back-end.<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/t96klmq.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I’m not sure if the brick style door frame actually belongs to the cabin building so I changed it. Normalized the lighting. I also fixed that ‘crease’ glitch with simple added calculations then re-positioned some tiles to where they belong.<br>

              <pre><code> It's been a while since I've posted here- I have been re-thinking many 'elements' of construction to take for this project and testing little things before I commit fully to the project.  The current engine I had created in C++ and DirectX has been archived for now. Lately I have been inspired of how simple pythons language is and the libraries available. So I went back to the drawing board and more ideas came to mind.. I have also been wondering about the amount of development I could do without turning RS1 into a half-ass RS2 project. 
</code></pre>
<p>Here is what concerns me at this time…</p>
<p>[ul][li]3d Modeling-- If I used Autocad 3ds max to recreate the sprites and animation it would have to be at least 90% focused on mimicking the character, tiles, walls, player camera, walk flow, animations, skilling etc to nearly exact… I.E My current idea is to start with the same camera view besides being able to completely rotate the camera any angle around the players character… The player character is being modeled in 3ds max (efficient enough however very basic model to start off with.) same textures and clothing/hair style but more colors to choose from. Item sprites in inventory will remain the exact same. the players’ mouseover menus will remain exactly the same (tbd). Skilling will have no animation at all (for now to stick with rs1 bubble). I will replicate the combat animation to best of ability however magic casts and ranging will have new animation simulating archery and magician(tbd). All tiles, walls, and objects will remain the same however they must be converted into 3d objects as well…   [/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Once again, the game engine is now being written in python using a few external libraries for handlers and composing well just about everything… Soon as I get  done with a model or two of the character it will be previewed here. Pretty soon I should have a fully functional character creation segment of the game with the player having ability to choose its starting role in RS1 Remastered.</p>
<p>Edit: After reviewing the character sprites and few fail attempts at getting a close mimic of the 2d sprites into a 3d form using 3ds max I am currently withdrawing the idea of 3d for now but not entirely. Being that RS1s character design has many flaws in topography- lighting and body posture so oddly coordinated (I wont get into all the details yet.) I will take a break from that and continue to finish the character registration scene and roster everything under a private mysqli server for now with various of encoders to secure player password. I will not require an email to registration as you never needed to back then. I probably won’t do the player reporting segment until lateron I still would like to see a semi functioning game before I start doing the other necessities. I have also designed a color scheme for the 2d registration system that will add 200 more color choosing options to the players torso and pants, without mathematically altering the various shaders. Somebody had requested that I made a secondary client for the game to be played in webbrowsers. I am not saying 100% I will but like I said before I will need to make sure I am even able to correctly place all of the objects in their original positions with character functioning (movement &amp; animation) with camera view with a few objects in place first to further decide where this project really goes.</p>
<p>Nothing to showcase yet but if you want a laugh heres what the 3d model looked like after I deleted a bunch of oddly "I cant have this shet " polygons.<br>
Youll know what I mean when I started singing the wizard of oz song.</p>
<p><img src="http://s7.postimg.org/tnh1clecb/3dpreview_rs1remastered.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Perhaps I need more practice in the 3ds field however I am always game for a challenge. This one sure feels like the one I need.</p>
<p>Going back to the C++ Platform, I decided to go ahead and finish the Login/Registration system for that program. Few changes here so far. I’ve yet to implement the mysqli server into the program however for now the game info will be saved to an .ini. Showcases seen below;</p>

<pre><code> I ventured around the google and visited a well known private server, RSCRevolution and had an idea and submitted a forum thread to them. I believe it would be a good idea to use the old wayback machine as a reference to recreate the old RuneScape's Website. This was the example used as the suggestion for recreating purposes if pursued.

<p>Edit:     I’m not too sure about this screen I just feel its too clustered in the center. I’ve been writing and debugging for possibly over 16 hours now and I need to sleep but for now this is how the Character Creation Screen looks. ill go back and reorganize everything later.<br>
I will also showcase the new color selection system and how boots could be simply added to the color selection system. I could also allow belt color selection; but we will see.</p>

<p>Still in the Character Creation topic… When I created my first character in RS1, you had the option of choosing the type (or role) of character you wanted to start out as. I vaguely remember the selections, I believe you could choose to start out as an adventurer (+1 attack, defense, strength??), wizard? ( +2-3 magic?), archer (+2-3), miner (+3 mining?)., This is something I’d like to bring back just because I thought it was a neat feature then</p>

<p>The one thing I loved when I first booted up nemesis 39 server. Looking forward to seeing where this leads.</p>
