[size=14pt][b]Introduction[/b][/size]
In this tutorial, you will be able to set up a very basic minecraft server running on your computer. This means, it is not dedicated, so whenever you shutdown your computer, your server will shut down aswell. This is why if you plan on making a dedicated server, you need to buy a VPS to host it, which can get costly (depending on how big of a VPS you want.)

[size=14pt][b]Step One: Portforwarding[/b][/size]
Yep, portforwarding is back, you know it, you probably hated it, all from RSPS. I&#39;m going to be doing this on a Belkin router. In order for multiple IP&#39;s to connect to your server, you NEED to portforward. Many people have trouble with it, which I honestly don&#39;t understand why because it is so easy. What you&#39;re going to have to do is go into &quot;run&quot; and type in &quot;cmd&quot;. Then type in &quot;ipconfig&quot;.  It should then open information about your computer, but what you really need (in this case) is the Default Gateway. It is usually 192.168.*.*. Everyones Default Gateway has it&#39;s own uniqueness, which they are all different. Once you have the Default Gateway, type it into your browser (such as IE, Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome, etc). It should then open up all your router information, if it asks for a password, try either:

[ol][li]blank[/li]
[li]admin[/li][/ol]

If neither of those work, head over to http://www.portforward.com/ and check out their huge password list for multiple routers. All router control panels are different, and in this case for a Belkin router, go to the left and click on &quot;Virtual Servers&quot;. Enable two checkboxes, name them whatever you want, and the port MUST be 25565. For the IP, enter your IPv4 Address from ipconfig there. Make one checkbox TCP and the other UDP. Once you&#39;re done, scroll down and click &quot;save&quot;, and bam you just portforwarded.

[b][size=14pt]Step Two: Downloading the resources[/size][/b]
Now that you have successfully portforwarded, now head over to minecraft.net. Then, at the right, click &quot;Download&quot;, and then scroll to the bottom. You should see &quot;Running Your Minecraft Server&quot; (or something along those lines). Download Minecraft_Server.exe and run it. Next, download minecraft_server.jar and run that as well. If everything was correctly completed, you should be able to connect via 192.168.*.*:25565.</description>
