    <description>I&#39;m new to programming in general, learned about the basics. Input, variables, methods, one tutorial on each. 

Before I think I&#39;ve done this the most efficient way just because it&#39;s working, could anybody tell me if this code could be written anymore efficient?
[code=java]
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AreaCalculator {

	@SuppressWarnings(&quot;resource&quot;) /* Here because scan was never closed */
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println(&quot;Are you looking for a rectangle(1) or circle(2)&#39;s area?&quot;);
		int answer = scan.nextInt();
		if (answer == 1){
			System.out.println(&quot;What is the length of the rectangle?&quot;);
			double length = scan.nextDouble();
			System.out.println(&quot;What is the height of the rectangle?&quot;);
			double height = scan.nextDouble();
			double area = height * length;
			System.out.println(&quot;The area of your rectangle is &quot; + area);
		}
		if (answer == 2){
			System.out.println(&quot;What is the radius of the circle?&quot;);
			double radius = scan.nextDouble();
			double area = 3.14*(radius*radius);
			System.out.println(&quot;The area of your circle is &quot; + area);
		}
		else if (answer &gt;= 3 || answer &lt;= 0){
			System.out.println(&quot;You have picked a number not specified.&quot;);
		}
	}
}[/code]

I realize this is as basic as it gets, it&#39;s the first program(since I stopped trying awhile back) in java that I could think of. 
(I wrote them in doubles just on the chance of people using decimals, plus with the circle I can&#39;t use Int&#39;s as the area.

Currently going into learning JFrame, going to make a basic game and learn off of that</description>

              <p>You’re welcome! Glad to help. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>If you’d want less lines of code, while using a switch statement, you don’t actually need the braces ("{", “}”) around the “case” and “default” sections. In your case, the second declaration of the variable “area” is a duplicate according to the compiler, but only if you remove the braces. So then, to remedy this, either change the name of at least one variable, or remove the “double” in front of it in the second “case”.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Here I did it for you:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class AreaCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try(Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in)) {
            System.out.println("Are you looking for a rectangle(1) or circle(2)'s area?");
            switch(scan.nextInt()){
                case 1:
                    System.out.println("What is the length of the rectangle?");
                    double length = scan.nextDouble();
                    System.out.println("What is the height of the rectangle?");
                    double height = scan.nextDouble();
                    double areaOfRectangle = height * length;
                    System.out.printf("The area of your rectangle is %f%n", areaOfRectangle);
                    break;
                case 2:
                    System.out.println("What is the radius of the circle?");
                    double radius = scan.nextDouble();
                    double areaOfCircle = Math.PI * radius * radius;
                    System.out.printf("The area of your circle is %f%n", areaOfCircle);
                    break;
                default:
                    System.out.println("You have picked a number not specified.");
            }
        }
    }

<p>Didn’t even see the possibility of writing it like that, makes complete sense though.  :o</p>

              <ol>
<li>You could use a try-with-resources statement if you’re using Java 7 or later. It makes it possible to skip closing instances of various classes (those implementing java.lang.AutoCloseable).</li>
<li>You could use a switch statement instead of an if-else statement. It worked well on your case, as your last else-if is essentially the same as the default of a switch statement.</li>
<li>Not that much of an improvement in your case, but using printf(String, Object…) rather than print(String) or println(String) may make it easier to read. Especially if you have a lot of Objects or other primitives being part of the text.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: {<br>
4. You can use java.lang.Math.PI, rather than writing 3.14 explicitly.<br>
5. You can use an else-if statement, rather than just the second if statement (“if (answer == 2){…}”).<br>
6. Rather than “else if (answer &gt;= 3 || answer &lt;= 0){”, you could use an else statement.<br>
7. You can sefely remove the parenthesis around “radius * radius”, because multiplication is commutative. No matter the order, the result will be the same.<br>
