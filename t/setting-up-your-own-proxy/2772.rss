    <title>Setting up your own proxy?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-up-your-own-proxy/2772</link>
    <description>I want to make an online based proxy to use at school. I have an admin account at school, but I want to create a proxy for my friends to use because just about every single proxy I can find is blocked. 

I lookedon google, but they say stuff like upload it to your server, make sure the server has CGI support, etc..

But I want to use my home computer. Does anyone have any clue where to start? There must be some free open source proxy that I can configure to use at my house. I have a decent internet speed, but I know it&#39;ll be slow as hell but I dont care.

What programs would I need? Or where should I start?

Would I need something like Apache?(I&#39;ve never used it before, is it easy to use?)
And does anyone know any program/scripts for creating an http proxy that is webbased? 

Security is not an issue also, because it&#39;ll only be shared with a few friends.  [br][size=1]Posted at: May 13, 2006, 09:43:30 am[/size][hr]Oh and will I need a domain name? or can i use no-ip.org?[br][size=1]Posted at: May 13, 2006, 09:45:23 am[/size][hr]Hmm.. I found a neat program:

I&#39;ll give it a try first. [br][size=1]Posted at: May 13, 2006, 09:51:29 am[/size][hr]Lol another question:

It says port 443 is blocked. I have enabled it in my router, and i did everything it said. I have turned off my firewall, and yet it still says it is blocked. Anyone know whats wrong?</description>

<p>How do you password protect your site? and if you want to access blocked sites try downloading ultrasurf, it works anywhere and lets you do what you want. You can download it at <a href="http://www.ultrasurf.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.ultrasurf.com</a>, if that doesnt work just search it up on <a href="http://download.com" rel="nofollow noopener">download.com</a> (where i downloaded it)[/quote]</p>

<p>I contacted my ISP, they tell me to contact linksys(maker of my router) so i phoned them up, they tell me to phone my ISP.</p>

<p>Man this is so annoying, lol. I'll use the "Im paying you 50 dollars a month so give me an answer" on my isp -.-[br][size=1]Posted at: May 14, 2006, 08:54:20 am[/size][hr]Im done talking to them all, they are all retards.</p>

<p>I decided to look up google for more info, and found a few free hosts/servers that have CGI support and I tried them. I just finished setting it all up, bow I get an error message saying CGIproxy initializing failed!</p>

<p>According the this open source proxy, Perl 5.something has to be installed. Does anyone know a good host with all this? I dont want to have to resort to azn-hosting because he'll never do anything for me.</p>
