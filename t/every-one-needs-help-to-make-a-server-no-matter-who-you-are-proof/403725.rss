    <description>Here is a thread I grave dug by acerdent, it involves &#39;Mod Tiko&#39; asking for help on making a server from 2007 (found completely by acerdent)
Should make you guys think before you start flaming at people for wanting to learn how to make a server, especially if it is in the help section...

https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=167500.0

No one is born with the knowledge of Server development, the simply grasp it by the balls and suck out all of its wonderful and helpful knowledge until they become knowledgeable and help out the people who haven&#39;t found the right set of balls and hand theirs to them to suckle on...

Mod Tiko, Remove if it is too embarrising...</description>

<p>There is a difference in time, Back then RSPS were just starting so changing simple interface was as hard as Making the dungeonering skill now, There was times were if you had Dragon claws on your server you were the best of all servers…  But thats in time, then people developed more knowledge on actually making servers so now thoughs things are easy and are a “noob” rank coding skill.</p>
<ul>
<li>hes not asking how to make a server hes asking how to change the background and then people are pointing him to the right files and thats it, so there not Spoon feeding him as we all tell you guys we won’t do… You made your self look stupid by making this.</li>

<p>racists fuck, the point I’m making is that it isn’t necessary to flame people who are just starting out, especially if they are posting in the ‘server help’ section on the forums… It is just plain rude in my opinion. And it will demotivate people who may possibly be able to create the ‘next big thing’.</p>
<p>Although there are really dumb mother fuckers out there, I used to be one and possibly still am, but I and many others are getting the hang of it.</p>
