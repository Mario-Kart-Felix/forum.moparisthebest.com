    <title>Can contains() check inside Object? in ArrayList/List .NET</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-contains-check-inside-object-in-arraylist-list-net/395615</link>
    <description>Hello I started to make a little project in VB.NET it&#39;s very important to me because of the profits it generates.

I&#39;m trying to make a private messaging technique which when players in the game pm my bot.. it will pop up a new Windows.Form and blah blah like a instant massager thing so I can convince more players to buy my duped gold.. at first sales were steady was making 1500$ USD a day for about a solid month straight now, but recently business is slow I barely make 250$ USD a day now and thats why I&#39;m trying to solve this. I&#39;m really worried I won&#39;t be able to make my $75k mark which i was hoping to make before this dupe gets patched.

Anyways down to coding.. I haven&#39;t did anything in VB.NET in a while.. very rusty wondering if I can do this without a iteration loop.

so I got this in my global scope

[code]
    Public currentPMs As New List(Of frmPM) &#39;lots of PM forms for searching purposes
[/code]

Everytime a packet comes in that someone private messages me I would like it to search the currentPMs to see if it&#39;s a existing opened Windows.Form or else open a new form..

Trying to make like a little MSN/AIM/Skype type of messaging thing.. (this doesn&#39;t exist in the game).

I use this code below to create a new one

[code]
        Dim privateMsgName As String =  Encoding.Default.GetString(packet, 20, 12) &#39;Max size of player name.
        Dim firstMessage as String =  Encoding.Default.GetString(packet, 45, 256) &#39;Max size of message.

&#39;Confused here maybe loop or something like .contains(frmPM.isName(privateMsgName) = True)
        If currentPMs.contains(frmPM.isName(privateMsgName)) = False Then &#39;This line is what this topic is about
            Dim frmPM As New frmPM
            frmPM.personsName = privateMsgName
            frmPM.Text = &quot;Private Message from: &quot; + privateMsgName
            frmPM.addChatMsg(firstMessage)
            frmPM.Show()
            currentPMs.Add(frmPM)
       Else
             &#39;blah blah the one that exists.. start appending chat data blah blah
       End if
[/code]

the isName function in frmPM (Windows Form) is just for validation purposes

[code]
Public Class frmPM
    Public personsName As String

    Function isName(ByVal name As String) As Boolean
        Return personsName = name
    End Function
...
End Class
[/code]

Can this be done without looping?


Edit: I just did it like this.. anyone can improve this? naw well whatever i dont care as long as it works.

[b]My Answer = [/b]
[code]
        Dim privateMsgName As String = Encoding.Default.GetString(packet, 20, 12) &#39;Max size of player name.
        Dim privateMsg As String = Encoding.Default.GetString(packet, 45, 256) &#39;Max size of message.
        Dim found As Boolean = False
        For Each eachPM As frmPM In currentPMs
            If eachPM.isName(privateMsgName) Then
                eachPM.addChatMsg(privateMsg)
                found = True
                Exit For
            End If
        Next
        If found = False Then
            Dim frmPM As New frmPM
            frmPM.personsName = privateMsgName
            frmPM.Text = &quot;Private Message from: &quot; + privateMsgName
            frmPM.addChatMsg(privateMsg)
            frmPM.Show()
            currentPMs.Add(frmPM)
        End If
[/code]



Argh it&#39;s really I guess not that important I was just trying to optimize it so it wouldn&#39;t lag without loops because I run 32 of these programs on my computer for each game server so I will get tons of pms.. of the whole userbase, I esimiate I&#39;ll have to be able to handle maybe 100 or more PMs every few seconds lol. Just trying to fix this asap because I&#39;m losing alot of profits which I can use in the future to start up a reliable business.</description>
