    <title>GameStop Trade-In Pricing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gamestop-trade-in-pricing/341324</link>
    <description>[i]Before you start, I&#39;m not concerned about GameStop being a scam as that&#39;s well-aware to me. If I did care, I&#39;d look towards eBay.[/i]

Well, I&#39;ve been looking to buy DBZ: Budokai 2 strictly for the Game Cube (I don&#39;t want to be forced to buy it for the PS2 or something else) and I don&#39;t want to spend money out of my pocket. The game is $10, and I have a lot of games I could cash in, but I don&#39;t want to over-do it as it&#39;s all in-store credit.

I was unable to find average pricing for returning used products (Meaning you give them something you&#39;ve previously owned, bought there or not, and they&#39;ll pay you for it and sell it over 9000% than what they gave you), but I have had some experience a while back. I gave them a mint-condition month-old GC game that was $50 and I got $15 in return. But hey, business is business and it&#39;s better than having it sit around the house collecting dust.

[b]But anyway, do you think two DS games in brand-new condition (Case, booklets, hardly touched) would get me $10?[/b] The games are Pokemon Diamond and DQM: Joker. There is also a 30% price boost on DS games, so that helps me as well.

              <p>Don’t ever return games to GS. Because like you said, they pretty much sell for 9000% of what you gained.<br>
Games should be a collection, even if they do “collect dust”.</p>
<p>It just shows what games you liked during the time they came out.</p>
