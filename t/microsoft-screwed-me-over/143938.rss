    <description>Lol. Well, when i first got vista, from that time i&#39;m like omfg rofl shit. It LAGS way too much. Before when i had windows xp, if i ran 14 viruses, I sware i&#39;d still be running faster then this. So, a while ago, Jeebles told me that Windows XP is less then 600mb, so i&#39;m like whoohoo I can put it on a audio disc. So I download a pirated version with lots of good feedback, on demonoid.com, I install it correctly. However, a error appears after starting it up for the first time. Something about Windows will now adjust your monitor blah blah.. SO, the only option is ok, so I click it. When I go to login screen, it appears that the screen is only 640x480. THEN, When i login, it says click this bubble to fix your monitor. I&#39;m like woohoo! I click it, all it does is open the start menu   :rolleyes:. When I go to Properties &gt; Settings&gt; And try to switch the resolution or whatever you want to call it, It doesn&#39;t move at all.  :confused:. I try going online to seek assitance, but the problem is my ISP disc says this:YOU NEED 840X600 RESOLUTION, or something like that (I&#39;m back on windows vista so don&#39;t give me piss if i have completely wrong information, i can&#39;t remember.) I went into help &amp; support or whatever, and i did everything there it told me to do. Nope, nothing.
Any ideas? Has microsoft made it so you can&#39;t go back to xp from vista lol?  :|</description>

<p>I just switched from Vista to XP. I have 2GBs of RAM and it was using 700mb of it idle. Good or bad? Two ways to look at it. Used RAM means good RAM as Vista ‘caches’ your RAM to make starting up programs much faster. Since switching back to XP, it has been much better, and I dont recommend Vista if you’re running on 1GB.</p>

<p>You may have to activate the product when it’s installed. If so, goodluck :P. Here’s a useful post I found about activating it (if you have to)</p>
<blockquote>Seeing as I have had to install XP a few times today, with no legit copy, I'll tell you how to get round it. On the activation screen there should be an option to do it by telephone. Do it that way, then, if it doesn't work, you'll be connected to a MSoft call center based in India. Here, just ask for an activation code after they have asked Windows version and your installation ID. You will understand it when you give it a try. Also, the phone call is free from a land based line. Note though, the department for activation is only open Mondays to Fridays.</blockquote>

              <p>Lol. Well, when i first got vista, from that time i’m like omfg rofl shit. It LAGS way too much. Before when i had windows xp, if i ran 14 viruses, I sware i’d still be running faster then this. So, a while ago, Jeebles told me that Windows XP is less then 600mb, so i’m like whoohoo I can put it on a audio disc. So I download a pirated version with lots of good feedback, on <a href="http://demonoid.com" rel="nofollow noopener">demonoid.com</a>, I install it correctly. However, a error appears after starting it up for the first time. Something about Windows will now adjust your monitor blah blah… SO, the only option is ok, so I click it. When I go to login screen, it appears that the screen is only 640x480. THEN, When i login, it says click this bubble to fix your monitor. I’m like woohoo! I click it, all it does is open the start menu   :rolleyes:. When I go to Properties &gt; Settings&gt; And try to switch the resolution or whatever you want to call it, It doesn’t move at all.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:">. I try going online to seek assitance, but the problem is my ISP disc says this:YOU NEED 840X600 RESOLUTION, or something like that (I’m back on windows vista so don’t give me piss if i have completely wrong information, i can’t remember.) I went into help &amp; support or whatever, and i did everything there it told me to do. Nope, nothing.<br>
Any ideas? Has microsoft made it so you can’t go back to xp from vista lol?  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
