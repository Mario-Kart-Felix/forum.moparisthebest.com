    <description>[center]RSC Private Server Downloads - Protosstribe / ephemeral[/center]

In this topic I will post links that leads you to RSC private server downloads. They will be safe, and even a few never ever before released sources will now be downloadable. All of these sources have in some way been modified and/or made by me. Some of the source-downloads have only been given away for nostalgia-reasons, in case someone wish to see how it used to be before (and I discourage you to use these as bases). The versions at the top, are the oldest ones, and the ones furthest down, the newest ones (yes, even newer than RSCDaemon).

FreeScape (1):
- Description: The first ever RSC private server I developed on.
- Usage: Only for nostalgia-reasons. Don&#39;t even bother fixing this one...
- Status: Released before.
- Source-base: eScape, which was based off of WinterLoves RuneScape emulator.
- Download link: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=GV0ZFLJS

RSGD : RuneScape: Glass Dagger (1):
- Description: My first RSC private server using the RSCD-base.
- Usage: Only for nostalgia-reasons. Just don&#39;t use... Contains f-ugly code.
- Status: Released before.
- Source-base: RSCD (the first version, and not RSCDaemon).
- Download link: http://rapidshare.com/files/161327718/runescape_glass_dagger.rar.html

Geminus (ezpk.org version):
- Description: The version hosted at ezpk.org.
- Usage: Only for nostalgia-reasons, unless you have time to fix bugs and f-ugly code.
- Status: Released before.
- Source-base: An earlier version of Geminus.
- Download link: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=YCHHRNTP

Geminus (latest version):
- Description: The original and latest version.
- Usage: May be used. Contains some bugs, but can be fixed.
- Status: Never released before.
- Source-base: Itself.
- Download link: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=ZACBRZE3

MoonSpell (latest version):
- Description: Based off of the latest Geminus.

- Download link: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=BEZPBUS1

RSGD : RuneScape: Glass Dagger (2):

- Status: Never released before.
- Source-base: Itself, except for some influences from RSCD and Geminus.
- Download link: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=4W6D665V

RSCDEF : RuneScape Classic Development &amp; Emulation Framework &amp; FreeScape (2):
- Description: The original version of this base.
- Usage: May well be used. However, the Area-system needs some fixing.
- Status: Never released before.
- Source-base: Itself.
- Download link: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=4EOKMN39

[center]About RSCDEF and FreeScape (2):[/center]

As you have noticed, I have now released my latest project (RSCDEF and FreeScape (2)). I won&#39;t help with setting it up or so. Perhaps I might write a guide, or let someone that managed to set it up to write a guide for how to do it. But that won&#39;t be today, in case anyone asks. Anyhow, the source-code contains alot of comments, and is well organized (what I have heard people say). Although, some parts of it is, in my opinion, little bit un-organized... That is the biggest reason why I stopped working on it.

RSCDEF and FreeScape (2) goes hand-in-hand. FreeScape (2) is the default server that uses the framework RSCDEF (or made by that framework). RSCDEF simply means RuneScape Classic Development &amp; Emulation Framework. Also, some of you don&#39;t know what the differences between RSCDEF and RSCDaemon-based servers (or any RSCD-based servers for that matter) is. RSCDEF is relying on a technique using areas to divide the processing into smaller parts, making the processing much, much faster in bigger scales. Also, every connecting client will be given their own thread in which their updates will be processed independently. This makes processing on computers with more processors to go faster (the more processors, the faster). Also, every client have their own private queue for processing events that only themselves should be able to see. Even the area which they are located in, have an event-queue, which should be used for every action that can be seen by surrounding players. What you do, is simply post an event to the appropriate queue (whether it is the private or the public one), and all the players that have access to this queue will process that particular event. You will notice pretty much how the latency will decrease when using this server-framework compared to that of RSCDaemon or others. To note is also that RSCDEF loads its NPCs, GroundItems, GroundObjects and WallObjects from serialized Area-files... These Area-files will be loaded whenever someone requests to stand in an Area where the particular Area have not yet been loaded.


[center]The features that are in RSCDEF are the following:[/center]

[center]- Banking
- Melee-Fighting
- Bone-Burying (Prayer)
- Smithing
- Fletching
- Dropping
- Picking Up
- Following
- Public Chat
- NPCs
- Ground Objects
- Automatic Healing (Every 1 Minute)
- Potting
- Eating (Healing)
- Commands
- Player-Statuses (Administrator, Player etc.)

I hope you like it...[/center]

Note: I posted in a separate thread (and not the sticky), because I wanted all the descriptions for every server to be there. Also, all of these servers are servers that _I_ personally have made (either by modifying an existing one, or creating a totally new one). They can all be moved to the sticky later on, when this thread is dead... I didn&#39;t post all sources I have on my disk, which I did not do because I want the sources that I have modified and/or created (as stated above).</description>

              <p>KO9: Yeah, the processor can only run one thread at a time, but the thread is shifting every 10 millis (or similar), which also is OS-specific. And waiting a certain amount of millis (with for instance Thread.sleep(#)) does not necessarily mean that the thread will be paused for exact that time.</p>
<p>Anyway, what causes the most latency-decreasment in RSCDEF and FreeScape (2) is probably the EventQueue-system, and the Area-system. The EventQueue-system because it can handle <em>many</em> Events in very short time. The Area-system because it does not have as many ground-items, ground-objects, wall-objects, npcs and players to iterate through, as the World-system in RSCD-based servers.</p>

              <p>In theory multiple threaded applications should perform better than single threaded applications. Especially if you have multiple-core, or multiple processors. Even on a single-core single processor setup if one thread is waiting then the CPU can process another thread in the application (I believe?).</p>
<p>Creating a large number of connections in a short period of time impacts RSCDv25 heavily, it causes CPU to shoot through the roof and in most cases run out of resources and crash. It can however be fixed easily using checks and just returning if an IP (or multiple IPs) connects at a set threshold.</p>
<p>Do you know which parts of FreeScape + RSCDEF contribute towards the reduced latency the most, area based arrays, multi-threaded, etc. Or general code optimisation?</p>

              <p>There are no guarantees that this one-thread-per-client approach will work better, because I havn’t been able to test the server-load with a high number of players. But I can only guess that it will work better. The only real problem as I can see, would be if someone have a program that rapidly connects to the server again and again; this will definitely impact on the server-load. But once again, if someone does that, I am almost sure you will have the same problem no matter what approach you use, depending on your servers connection that is.</p>

<p>Thanks, I’m looking into making the RSCD source multi-threaded (as in each player gets its own thread) and this is a very good reference. Good job <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>How did you handle thread synchronization? Not familiar with threads at all, but by the looks of it, you created a threaded class called client that gets initiated each time a player logs on, and all methods are linked from Script in the form of thread.getPlayer().command.</p>
<p>What if a player eats while it’s getting ranged at? I did take a look at MobileEntity and that it implements Serializable, but like I said, I’m not familiar with threads and Google didn’t give me much info on the subject. (I’m assuming the implementation of Serializable has something to do with thread handeling).</p>
