    <title>Server not working (large amounts of detail given)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-not-working-large-amounts-of-detail-given/99196</link>
    <description>OK Heres what I have done EXACTLY.
~Downloaded JDK and linked the paths and classpaths.
~Downloaded No-ip software
~Made a no-ip account with my Ip address
~Forwarded the ports on my router and used 192.168.2.2 as the server (This is my computer not my router, which should it be?)
~Downloaded one of the runescape remake things (Satans Isle)
~Compiled Satans Isle
~Click run server after ticking my host in no-ip and it smiles.

I log into my server as 0.0.0.0 but I&#39;m pretty sure that thats local, my server (tidenburg.no-ip.org) is not working on my computer.

If its not here then I&#39;ve not done it, am I meant to change any settings in the no-ip program? Or is it the fact that i set the port forward sever to my pc&#39;s local Ip and not my routers IP?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</description>

              <p>No i’ve tried that, the only way I can login is by typing in 0.0.0.0<br>
Should my satans isle folder be located anywhere specific, i’ve looked for the ultimate server guide but when I click the link it says this specific forum may be deleted or out of bounds to you</p>
<p>Can a moderator move this please?</p>
