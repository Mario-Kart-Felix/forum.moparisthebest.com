    <title>How much do we know?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-much-do-we-know/467</link>
    <description>Hey, it&#39;s the community boards. Cool.

I wanted to ask what we&#39;re certain about in terms of detection.

1) When the focus changes, part of the update loop notifies the server (0 or 1)

2) If you run the client as an application, it notifies the server (0x3f008edd)

3) If your account has been flagged, the client begins sending hash-logs of your mouse movements at various intervals. This has been decently explained by the mole.

4) There are some strings in recent clients that threaten IP bans. Do they actually happen? For instance, there is no &quot;hexediting&quot; skill, but it&#39;s in the client.</description>

              <p>If I read the history correctly, there have been similar downtimes before. Someone always comes back with something newer and better. It might even be that someone completely independent of us will start making RuneScape cheats like we've never seen before. Until then, we can only work toward it ourselves and try to get the kind of info sharing that we had at early kaitnieks going again. <br>RS cheating will never die, even if all of us quit tomorrow, but we can certainly help it wake up again.</p>

<p>IP bans definatly dont make sense, so if thats what it means it is definatly just there to scare off the noobs, idk much about java and MAC addresses, but im sure its possible, and if I were jagex that is what I would do <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=3" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Lol, there are two conflicting thoughts for me. One is that I started the "Mod Semaphore" thing as a joke. He knew it was a joke cause I posted about it in the superspecial boards. Of course, now that he's disappeared the whole thing does seem a little suspicious. Unfortunately, I can't verify any info about him without racking up quite a phone bill, so I guess we'll never know.</p>

              <p>its really late atm, but I will address 2 of your concerns:</p>

<p>2) not really when you run it as an application persay, just when its ran in its own frame (ie if you run it in a custom jframe like moparscape or aryan your alright)</p>

<p>4) I was thinking this is more along the lines of maybe a MAC address ban, or simply there to scare off the noobs</p>

<p>(btw, not to hijack this thread about it, but do we have any real proof that semaphore was a mole? (maybe someone should start another thread about it?))</p>

              <p>Hey, it's the community boards. Cool.</p>

<p>I wanted to ask what we're certain about in terms of detection.</p>

<p>1) When the focus changes, part of the update loop notifies the server (0 or 1)</p>

<p>2) If you run the client as an application, it notifies the server (0x3f008edd)</p>

<p>3) If your account has been flagged, the client begins sending hash-logs of your mouse movements at various intervals. This has been decently explained by the mole.</p>

<p>4) There are some strings in recent clients that threaten IP bans. Do they actually happen? For instance, there is no "hexediting" skill, but it's in the client.</p>
