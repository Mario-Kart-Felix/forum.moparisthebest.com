    <title>Obsessed with money</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/obsessed-with-money/206104</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently struggling with some weird emotions.
Every night from about a few weeks ago i just lay in my bed thinking about how i would like to have lots of money.
I&#39;m guessing every kid does have that dream, but mine is every fucking night.
 I made €400 without working so im pretty happy about it but now i want more and more. I didn&#39;t even spend the 400 and my friends tell me im crazy and why do i still want to make more money when i have 400 to spend.
I&#39;m already selling my runescape account, i got €50 offered, selling a bike for €250 wich i got for free, now tommorow im headed to a(hopefully) abandoned warehouse where there are some electronic shit wich i will sell.
Now i&#39;m asking to all of you who are reading: Do you do this kind of shit as well, or do you feel exactly the same way i do?

Sometimes i also feel like im much more different then the kids around me.
I feel like im having a totally different way of thinking.
My principale once said to me that he didn&#39;t have experienced this( something that is hard to explain wich involves myself) in his whole career(50years).
Haven&#39;t heard of anyone with the same situation as me. I have a cross(+) on my head.
I dont know, i feel special :P Do you guys feel this too?</description>

<p>All I see here is some kid who:</p>
<p>a) Sells his stuff to make money.<br>

c) Wants more money.</p>
<p>That’s not a lot different from a huge percentage of the population.<br>
Don’t worry you aren’t unalike your friends.</p>
<p>By the way, don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying you shouldn’t believe you are important. I’m just saying everyone is unique, we share similarities and that is it. Just don’t be an idiot and go around preaching you are different/special/unique otherwise you sound like a self obsessed guy on an ego trip.[/quote]<br>
calm down dont take it so seriously, it’s a forum full of 14year olds for gods sake.<br>
I like to express how i feel , that way i feel relieved.<br>
If no one cares how i feel about myself, then why post such a long reply?Seems like you do care.<br>
And by the way, i’ve been around for longer then you think, i just had different names.</p>
<p>Im not going to call you names or something, just chill the fuck out , didnt think you were taking this so seriously.<br>
Just act like jme and post some funny retarded posts</p>

I don’t care for money.  I want it to help others, but I don’t really care about it.  I’d rather rid myself of every material I own and live naturally (Under certain circumstances!) than have a **** load of money.</p>
<p>Those feelings you have about being special and uniq<span class="bbcode-i">u</span>e… every teenager has that feeling.  I do.  I don’t think I’m special, or unique, I just don’t care about anything.  All I really care for is learning, understanding, helping, and love.  Every child has their own aspirations.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m sorry but that sounded gay.<br>
I would want to help others IF i had the money.<br>
I do think im special, i do think im unique, i do care about anything wich is money.<br>
Learning is the WORST thing in my life. I rather exercise for 1hour then learn for 10minutes.<br>
I really dont care about people i dont know, i just want money you know.[/quote]</p>
<p>Learning is the worst thing? Then tell me how you learned to exercise? If you don’t learn, then you’ll just be a vegetable. Doing nothing.</p>
<p>Also, NewAgeMovement. You’re not the only one who wants money. But if you think that’s the only thing you need. Then please get outside and get some fresh air. I think you banged your head on something.</p>

b) Saves his money rather than spend it.<br>
c) Wants more money.</p>
<p>That’s not a lot different from a huge percentage of the population.<br>
Don’t worry you aren’t unalike your friends.</p>

Just don’t be an idiot and go around preaching you are different/special/unique otherwise you sound like a self obsessed guy on an ego trip.</p>
