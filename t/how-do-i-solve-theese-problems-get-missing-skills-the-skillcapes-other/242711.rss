    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-solve-theese-problems-get-missing-skills-the-skillcapes-other/242711</link>
    <description>ok, first i need to know how to mod in skillcapes and the three missing skills.......

Then i need to know how to talk to the npcs so i can do the quests. (most of the npcs are missing,so i want them to come back)

then my last question, where do i find Client.Java ?

BTW... Some ladders are &quot;broken&quot;, you cant climb them, also some stairs are f-ed up...

Magic does not work either.....

Thx for the help to thoose who answer my questions</description>

              <p>Well… you base is pretty messed up but here it goes:<br>
1)What does “mod in skillcapes” mean?<br>
2)add your npc id and xy coords anywhere into your “autospawn.cfg” file in your server folder<br>
3)In your folder with all the server files in it is where client.java is…</p>
<p>P.S. to make ladders work, you need to find out what case that action is in your client.java and add a tele command to that case<br>
Hope i helped a little and sorry if i am wrong on anything</p>
