    <description>The one you guys want is Hybridscape with the capital h.  if someone would be kind enough to remove the old versions it would be much appreciated.

at first i was just trying to use rscds packet handler. but in rscd thats the biggest part.  so atm its looking like a rscd for rs2.</description>
