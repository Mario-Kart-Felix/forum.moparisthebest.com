    <title>Why is this not working the way I want it too?</title>

    <description>Hi,

I added this in client.java in the right place:

[code]case 153: // funfight request
            int PID = (misc.HexToInt(inStream.buffer, 0, packetSize) / 1000);
            client plyr = (client) server.playerHandler.players[PID];
            sendMessage(&quot;Sending funfight request...&quot;);
            plyr.sendMessage(playerName+ &quot;:duelreq:&quot;); 
            break; 
 

			case 139: // Duel/trade answer
				int plrID = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();
                                client pr  = (client) server.playerHandler.players[plrID];
if(funfightoff == 0) {
         		AttackingOn = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();
		client play2 = (client) server.playerHandler.players[AttackingOn];
			if((playerRights &lt;= 3) &amp;&amp; (funfight == 0) &amp;&amp; (play2.funfight == 0) &amp;&amp; (!infunfight())) {
				play2.funfight = 1;
				funfight = 1;
				play2.teleportToX = 2795;
				play2.teleportToY = 3321;
				teleportToX = 2793;
				teleportToY = 3321;
                		NewHP = getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]);
                		setSkillLevel(3, getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]), playerXP[playerHitpoints]);
                		playerLevel[3] = getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]);
                		play2.NewHP = play2.getLevelForXP(play2.playerXP[3]);
                		play2.setSkillLevel(3, play2.getLevelForXP(play2.playerXP[3]), play2.playerXP[play2.playerHitpoints]);
                		play2.playerLevel[3] = play2.getLevelForXP(play2.playerXP[3]);
                        	play2.refreshSkills();
                        	refreshSkills();
				sendMessage(&quot;You are getting teled to The Fun Fight Area !&quot;);
				play2.sendMessage(playerName+&quot; has challenged you for a fun fight !&quot;);
				play2.sendMessage(&quot;You are getting teled to The Fun Fight Area !&quot;);
} else if((playerRights &lt;= 3) &amp;&amp; (funfight != 0) &amp;&amp; (play2.funfight != 0) &amp;&amp; (!infunfight())) {
	sendMessage(&quot;You have challenged &quot;+play2.playerName+&quot; ...&quot;);
	sendMessage(&quot;... But you or &quot;+play2.playerName+&quot; already had a fight!&quot;);
	play2.sendMessage(playerName+&quot; had challenged you ...&quot;);
	play2.sendMessage(&quot;... But you or &quot;+playerName+&quot; allready had a fight!&quot;);
	funfight = 0;
	play2.funfight = 0;
	sendMessage(&quot;You can now challenge or be challenged again !&quot;);
	play2.sendMessage(&quot;You can now challenge or be challenged again !&quot;);
} else if((playerRights &lt;= 3) &amp;&amp; (funfight != 0) &amp;&amp; (play2.funfight != 0) &amp;&amp; (infunfight())) {
	sendMessage(&quot;You have challenged &quot;+play2.playerName);
	play2.sendMessage(playerName+&quot; has challenged you ... !&quot;);
	sendMessage(&quot;... But you already have a fight , tele off the isle and try again !&quot;);
	play2.sendMessage(&quot;... But you already have a fight , tele off the isle and try again !&quot;);
} 
           } else
if(funfightoff == 1) {
sendMessage(&quot;Fun fight is currently disabled. Please try again later.&quot;);
sendMessage(&quot;Or you can ask an administrator to enable it.&quot;);
} else {
if (!nonWild()) {
sendMessage(&quot;You must be out of the wilderness to use Funfight.&quot;);
sendMessage(&quot;Please leave the wilderness before using the Funfight feature.&quot;);
}
}
}
                                                                else if(pr.duelStatus != 0) {
                                 WanneTradeWith = plrID;
				 WanneTrade = 2;
                                }
				break;[/code]

When someone right clicks on a player and clicks fun fight, I want it to send a message to the player saying playername wishes to duel with you, when they click it (without the interface coming up) I want it to teleport them to the fun fight area, but it does that, apart from when the person clicks the duel request it trades them back.

How do I fix this?

Thanks</description>
