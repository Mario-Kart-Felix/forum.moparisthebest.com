<p>Lmao no not at all.<br>
Whether you put 1000 cpu’s or 1 the clock speed is still the same. You can’t go adding up.<br>
It’s like saying that if you drive with 5 cars that can reach 200mph, that you together will drive 1000mph[/quote]again, assumption lol never dealt with server cpu’s just know I have seen some crazy stuff out there. The 8120 at like 8.3 ghz was the highest I’ve heard about on a single cpu</p>
