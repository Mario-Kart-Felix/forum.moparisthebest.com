[size=12pt]What is Neptune?

Neptune is a 498. This is a solo project and all i&#39;m trying to do here is excel in my java knowledge. I will not use any tutorials during this project and I will be using  Project Insanity - Blank - All Dupes Fixed. I will be trying to make a unique server though with loads of exciting content. I might possibly host it if i&#39;m satisfied with the outcome and feel im motivated enough.[/size][/center]





[size=13pt][b]Economy:[/b][/size]
[list]
[li]The server will be very economy based and I will be focusing a lot on that. It will include the following...[/li][/list]
-Bosses: Many bosses that drop that valuable Items. I will be trying to make my own custom NPC Bosses possibly to work on my modeling. I will be adding a lot of custom bosses though such as NPC&#39;s that aren&#39;t used a lot in RSPS and boost up there stats.

-NPCs: Monsters that are strong can drop not so &quot;rare&quot; armour such as dragon scimitar and such. They won&#39;t be available in the shops.

-Commerce: Shops will offer things for basic needs such as materials for skilling, food, and basic combat armour to start your journey. You will need to kill monsters to get the good armour and even greater armours. In basic rsps&#39;s the dragon armour are just in shops and theres like 5 hours of gameplay until you&#39;re bored. My goal is to make it so that you have to work for gear.
For example, things like potions can only be made by herblore or buying off players instead of just purchasing them from a shop.

-Quests: Questing will be my main priority. I want to add a lot of long fun and detailed quests to the server that offer great rewards. Not half-assed 5 minute quests though. I will be working on a lot of quests and will be thinking of good story-lines to go with it. Along with the rewards at the end, I was thinking off giving you a quest point and being able to purchase items a shop.

[size=13pt][b]Goals[/b][/size]

- An upgrade system that is available by an NPC at the home area. For example, potions can start off buy giving a small bonus but by defeating a certain task the npc gives you, you can upgrade your potions. The tasks aren&#39;t going to be to hard because I don&#39;t want upgrading to be that hard. Not sure about this yet though.

- Custom minigames that you can do with your friends and some that you can do alone. Not so sure about this right now because I have no ideas yet on what to do.

[If I host the server] - Every month there would be a &quot;Boss season&quot; and on the highscores it will list the top 10 players who killed the most bosses, the number 1 player will recieve a reward or something.

- Interfaces: I want to focus a lot on custom interfaces and using them a lot for the server. Things such as teleporting and in my custom quests.

[i]I made this thread now to keep track of my project and update it frequently, I just started this and I will keep updating the thread.[/i][/list][/list][/list][/ul]</description>
