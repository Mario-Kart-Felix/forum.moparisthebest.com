    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-connecting/13947</link>
    <description>Hello, last night i was playing on a very fun server on moparscape. I had to get off, and now it&#39;s the next day later.. I can&#39;t get on any servers. Maybe i&#39;m typing something in wrong? I&#39;m still pretty new to this program. Please tell me all the info i need to enter to connect to a server. (exe. Port number if needed, what should it be?)

P.S. Whenever i try to connect, it says &quot;Error connecting to server. Must be down.&quot; And so on... Please help me  :)</description>
