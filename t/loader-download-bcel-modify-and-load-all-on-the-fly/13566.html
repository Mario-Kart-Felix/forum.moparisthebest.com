Since I only recently obtained access to this part of the forums from mopar I have not had a chance to post any code.

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Since I only recently obtained access to this part of the forums from mopar I have not had a chance to post any code.</p>
<p>I am not sure if you guys already have loaders, modifiers, etc… I dare say you do. But regardless here is a loader client hacker I wrote.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sythe.org/syloader.zip" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.sythe.org/syloader.zip</a></p>
<p>You will need the bcel libraries to use it. The test class has example use.<br>
To add new client patches open hackClientGen and locate the ‘// Todo: add patches here’ line. An example is given.</p>
<p>This loader works in the following way:<br>
Downloads the client jar and decompresses it in memory.<br>
Patches each class using bcel according to your patch calls.<br>
Loads the patched classes into a custom class loader.<br>
Executes ‘client’ using the custom class loader.</p>
<p>It was nessesary to null all functionality of the system security manager to make this work correctly. If anyone knows a better work around for this problem please inform me.</p>
<p>I hope this is of some use to someone.</p>

Yeah, if you had coded one, it would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile in under 0.5 seconds</li>
<li>Have atleast 16 classes</li>
<li>Each class would have more than 200 lines of code</li>
<li>Have been coded in less than 2.5 hours.</li>
<li>Use your bytecode library, of course</li>
<li>Download the client in under 2.4 seconds</li>
<li>Load the patched classes into a custom class loader in under 0.3 seconds</li>

<p>In the chat conv you told me you made the javascript that sythe used on his site to attack me.</p>
<p>You told me sythe puts backdoors in all his programs.</p>
<p>You told me geno stole your 3d cude scar script.  Then next day i talked to geno, it turns out you gave it to him and he had permission.  You got angry thou when he started selling the script.  You told me you leaked his script.  Geno later replaced the sube with a number muncher.</p>
<p>I talked to taios about arga, it turns out it only uses 25 lines of your code.</p>
<p>I can’t find anyone that supports your lies.  Semaphore and Sythe have posted to clear up what your telling people.</p>
<p>It seems you contact people then mystify them with all your claims to work then give them code you took from other projects.</p>

Yeah, if you had coded one, it would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile in under 0.5 seconds</li>
<li>Have atleast 16 classes</li>
<li>Each class would have more than 200 lines of code</li>
<li>Have been coded in less than 2.5 hours.</li>
<li>Use your bytecode library, of course</li>
<li>Download the client in under 2.4 seconds</li>
<li>Load the patched classes into a custom class loader in under 0.3 seconds</li>
<li>Execute client with the custom class loader in under 1.8 seconds.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nice job Sythe.[/quote]</p>
<p>Also pplz is about 4 classes and it honestly is much better. The 4 classes would include alot of the structure getting the rs loader itself and connecting. The methods are very l33t.</p>
<p>Ruler it is not about how much code pplz contributes as i have told you many of times, it is the info he gives us, the ideas, the well everything, you cant have a conversation with him without learning something. ARGA would in no way be as good as it is without him…NO WAY k? Face it. He is l33t. Deal with it. You dont have to believe him, i doubt he cares if you do but the fact remains he does whether you like it or not, know what he is doing when it comes to java. We also have evidence of his bytecode library, CODE EVIDENCE, and after that post by semaphore, semaphore posted in pplz PSBL post telling everyone he had seen proof aswell.</p>
<p>Pplz code to his bot is DEFINATLY original, i have no where seen it before. EVER. EVER EVER. Even how it loads rs, is like wow why didnt we think of that?</p>
<p>See ruler, code isnt as important to us as it is to you. You like code so you can steal it, what do you learn from that? Nothing.</p>

well first i ahve been around for almost a year<br>
geno has been around for many many years so i refence him alot<br>
The stuff pplsql told me that i could refence from my own time being around was all lies.   The stuff he said when geno was around was also false.  This makes the rest of his statements fall into question.</p>
<p>He takes one point of truth and strentches it to the extreme to the point it has no truth left.</p>
<p>According to sythe, semp, and even you.  He contributes a very small piece then gets the entire cake.  The cake being the bot or system.</p>

<p>Also pplz is about 4 classes and it honestly is much better. The 4 classes would include alot of the structure getting the rs loader itself and connecting. The methods are very l33t.</p>
<p>Ruler it is not about how much code pplz contributes as i have told you many of times, it is the info he gives us, the ideas, the well everything, you cant have a conversation with him without learning something. ARGA would in no way be as good as it is without him…NO WAY k? Face it. He is l33t. Deal with it. You dont have to believe him, i doubt he cares if you do but the fact remains he does whether you like it or not, know what he is doing when it comes to java. We also have evidence of his bytecode library, CODE EVIDENCE, and after that post by semaphore, semaphore posted in pplz PSBL post telling everyone he had seen proof aswell.</p>
<p>Pplz code to his bot is DEFINATLY original, i have no where seen it before. EVER. EVER EVER. Even how it loads rs, is like wow why didnt we think of that?</p>

<p>well first i ahve been around for almost a year<br>
geno has been around for many many years so i refence him alot<br>
The stuff pplsql told me that i could refence from my own time being around was all lies.   The stuff he said when geno was around was also false.  This makes the rest of his statements fall into question.</p>
<p>He takes one point of truth and strentches it to the extreme to the point it has no truth left.</p>
<p>According to sythe, semp, and even you.  He contributes a very small piece then gets the entire cake.  The cake being the bot or system.[/quote]</p>
<p>The code pplz has contributed was examples and to get us started, for example the runtime loader we use.</p>
<p>I do not care what you think ruler.</p>
<p>Pplz deserves alot more credit than he gets. This time with the arga project we are making damn sure he gets it. How many times have i told you? CODE IS NOT IMPORTANT. There are many more important things than code. Semp didnt put pplz down, he even said that he has great knowledge on bytecode and other things</p>
<p>I am more happy that pplz gave us information for a excellent ARGA structure than if ppl offerd to make the whole bot structure himself and give it to us.</p>
<p>Pplz even offerd to make you an OCR system.</p>

<p>Yup you did, but didnt want it even when you kept asking us:). The fact was that we wanted to do it ourselves and not take/use your code, as explained before pplz has mainly given code as example and to help out :).</p>
<p>O also, there would be classes non existant in arga if pplz hadnt given some stuff :), the 25 lines is a last recollection. Pplz to my knowledge hasnt exagerated on ARGA at all on how much he has helped, he is a main dev. The class we have to Override Applet stub wouldnt be in arga, also the runtime loader, probaly a fair few more but these are what i can remember off the top of my head and also this is an example of why code isnt everything. :).</p>
<p>Im not entirley sure on how much pplz has done with both semaphore bot and SS2, only Pplz, Sythe and semaphore would be able to tell us that but i do know pplz was undercredited for SS1, and has not tried to over credit himself in my eyes with his work on arga.</p>
<p>Pplz does admit hes a credit jew…good for him, if someone writes something or helps with something even a little they should be credited :).</p>
<p>As far as i know though, pplz hasnt taken the “entire cake” as everyone still knows that semaphore and Sythe both programmed in those projects and he helped along or worked on the project with them. I do of course not know enough about SS2 or Semaphore’s bot and this is just a general assumption.</p>
