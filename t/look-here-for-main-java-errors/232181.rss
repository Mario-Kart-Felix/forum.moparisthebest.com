    <title>Look here for &quot;main&quot; java... Errors!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/look-here-for-main-java-errors/232181</link>
    <description>Well I used to have this problem in the bat that gave me this error:

&quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: client
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: client
....


Here is the solution.

Rightclick on &quot;my computer&quot;
then pick &quot;properties&quot;
then in the tab click &quot;advanced&quot;
then at the bottom you will see &quot;variables&quot;
Click it.

Then you will see somthing like &quot;System Variables&quot;
Now if you already have a &quot;Variable&quot; called &quot;CLASSPATH&quot; skip this.
If not, press &quot;new&quot; , name it CLASSPATH and the varriable should 
lead to your client map.

Now for the variable.
It should lead you to your map.
For example, I play ploxagescape.
Now my variable is
C:\Doccument and Settings\Glenn\Desktop\Ploxagescape

Now &quot;C&quot; stands for your hard drive.
Mostly it will be &quot;c&quot; unless if you have another HD.

&quot;Doccument and Settings&quot; is a map in my HD. This map will make you able to pick files from your desktop.

&quot;Glenn&quot; stands for the my username. This is varries for everyone.

&quot;Desktop&quot; is where my file is saved on. For you it could be the same or &quot;my documents&quot;. It varries.

&quot;Ploxagescape&quot; is the name of the map where my client is in.

Btw, I&#39;m not an expert so I appologise if I said some things the wrong way. Just try to help people out. If you still get the error pm me some screenies of what you have done.</description>
