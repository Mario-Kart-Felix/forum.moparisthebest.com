This game in my opinion is going to be one of the best made, but then again I&#39;m a huge Kojima fanboy. This game will take place after Peace Walker (for those who played the games), and will consist of Big Boss building his private army but recruiting soldiers on the battlefield. This has already been done once in Peace Walker but the base was destroyed by XOF.

It&#39;s rumored to have 100-150 hours of gameplay counting the side-missions, along with online base invasion (stealing of resources etc), and an online mode.

Anyone here play the games, and is as excited as I am?</description>

<p>I wanted Silent Hills but those bastards being noobs they are along with the other people that were apart of the project had to ruin it for us.

<p>Konami is just ending all their ties with console-based games. The mobile market and slot machines are their new demographic. We were all excited for Silent Hills but you had to figure they’d pull this bullshit. Don’t know if you heard, but yes, even Metal Gear Solid getting Microtransactions. Basically just milking everything they can out of the last game.</p>
