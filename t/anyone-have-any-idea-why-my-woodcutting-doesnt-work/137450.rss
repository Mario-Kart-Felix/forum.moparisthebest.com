    <title>Anyone have any idea why my woodcutting doesn&#39;t work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-have-any-idea-why-my-woodcutting-doesnt-work/137450</link>
    <description>I have all the code necessary. The same code frugoo and funescap3 uses for woodcutting. Except, I can&#39;t woodcut! If you select chop (xtree) it does nothing. And yes don&#39;t ask &quot;lol did you have an axe equipped&quot; because I did.

Anything special you have to do outside the client? Or is there anything in the client.java that isn&#39;t labeld ~HELLO WOODCUTTING~ maybe some kind of hidden command? I don&#39;t know just something that will make my woodcutting work please?!</description>
