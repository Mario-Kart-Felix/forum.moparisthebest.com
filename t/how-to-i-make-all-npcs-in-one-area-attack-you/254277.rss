    <description>Hi moparscape, i&#39;m just wondering on how t make all npc&#39;s in one area attack you. Is it possible, i made a daggonath area, and it&#39;s kinda lame, i wan&#39;t them to automatically attack a person that enters the coordinates or goes near them, such as KQ in ReapageScape v1, if you have any help, codes, suggestion, or links it&#39;s much appreciated.</description>
