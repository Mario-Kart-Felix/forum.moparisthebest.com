    <title>Event based updating?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/event-based-updating/337921</link>
    <description>I&#39;m posting my ideas here because my knowledge of the client/protocol is quite limited and I&#39;m trying to figure out whether it will work or not.

I&#39;ve noticed that current servers exclusively use polling for player updating, my idea is to use an event system instead:

There would be a typical region system. I propose 16x16 regions, and as a player needs to see events in a 32x32 area, they would be &#39;subscribed&#39; to 9 regions at a time.
Player updates will be done per region, save for the player specific initial packet. When an event occurs in a region, it notifies every adjacent region. During player update, each region constructs the necessary update packets based on the events received since the previous server tick.
Possible events include player movement, player added/removed to region, player appearance change, chat messages, etc..


[IMG]http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/7758/eventj.png[/img]
In this example, a player leaves region B, and every adjacent region is notified. Since that player&#39;s new region is not adjacent to region A, all players in region A will be sent a packet indicating that said player should be removed. This packet would only need to be constructed once.

I think that is a sufficient description, what I want is for you to challenge the design so I can figure out if it is flawed or not before I attempt to implement it.</description>

Stupid question… wtf is the port offset and what values can it have?</p>
<p>Was thinking about the hardware needed to run 2048 clients, your gonna need a fat line to cope with all that traffic? And what about the socket buffer, that’s going to fill up pretty quick? Would you split the load by running the packets through ports with their own socket, effectively splitting the players into socket lists?<br>
Not really up on game server hardware, but it might be beter to restrict servers to just 256 players and have more servers. You wouldn’t need regions.</p>

              <p>when you get a trade request or attacked or whatnot, you would have to check if other player sees the acting player and make sure they do. i remember in real rs if you were in a crowded area it would only show an 8x8 or so square<br>
also, you could prioritize players by number of actions performed, to determine who should be sent to clients</p>

              <p>What’s the best method to populate the local players list if there are &gt;255 local players?<br>
Player ID, which i assume is governed by login time.<br>
Random.<br>
Least distance first.</p>
<p>I know there is a friends list filter used, but apart from that it seems like it’s a random selection, although you could probably test it with bots.<br>
If you use a least distance first approach, you’ll get a fog of war effect but with players?<br>
If you use the Player ID approach, which is probably easiest, a world 1 scenario would mean you’d be stood next to 255 other players unable to sell their crap.<br>
The only other thing i can think of is to have a player list for each region, which is able to hold 2048 players and list players in preference of the time they entered the region, still a dodgy method.</p>
<p>ALL players you can see MUST be able to see you?<br>
Coz otherwise trade requests wouldn’t work, and you could be attacked by an invisible enemy.</p>
<p>P.S. sorry to spam up your thread.</p>

<p>Is it that uncommon?<br>
Thinking about the old world 1 varrock bank (which a 16x16 region cuts into 4 btw)  made me think about what type of server your creating. The ideal is everyone spread about in small groups, the worst case scenario is old world 1 varrock with drop parties.<br>
I don’t think your going to be catering for either, it’s a private server, if it’s popular your going to get large groupings of players, either hacking the shit out of each other or calling each other noob. Server still has to work even if 2048 players stands on the same tile.<br>
Maybe there’s an adaptive solution.[/quote]<br>
not really, since a player can only have 255 local players regardless.</p>
<p>ill worry about it when everything else is done though</p>
