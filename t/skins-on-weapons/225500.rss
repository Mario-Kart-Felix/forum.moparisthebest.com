    <title>Skins on weapons</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/skins-on-weapons/225500</link>
    <description>I just wanna ask whether or not it is possible to change or create new weapons that are of my personal choice. My guess is that it is possible  because at the end of the day all the weapons are is pixels s they must editable. If it is possible could someone point me in the right direction as to how to change them. I&#39;m sorry for a nooby question but my main bone of contention with runescape has all ways been the way that it looks and it is possible i would like to go on and change all different aspects of the game to make it look better. This is for no ones use but my own so i don&#39;t mind if it will take quite a while i am prepared to put the effort in. I am also quite new to java so it will probably take me longer than most :) . All help is appreciated.
