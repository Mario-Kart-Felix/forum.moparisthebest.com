    <title>Editing Minimap/terrain Texture?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/editing-minimap-terrain-texture/251101</link>
    <description>Hey guys. I&#39;ve searched around a lot, looked into a renamed client, and asked my friends, but none helped help me solve my question. I heard Kevin (From R-S) had released a floor editor (Which is what I want) but as you know, R-S&#39;s domain expired. So, no luck from that.

Instead of being spoon-fed and asking for the tool, I&#39;m asking if anyone knows how to edit the floor textures and/[b]or[/b] the minimap, and if they&#39;d be kind enough to tell me how do to it, so I can make a tool to that does it.

Pretty much what I want is to be able to change the green grass into a gray path, and create a town... But, if no one can help me with changing it, that&#39;s fine...

Thanks for helping. But I doubt that anyone here who knows where &amp; how to edit the floor textures will share it anyways... Worth a shot though ;)

[b]EDIT: Sorry, I don&#39;t mean overall textures. Here&#39;s an example of what I mean...[/b]

<p>So 3 failed possibilities… Hopefully there’s still a chance I can get it…</p>
