    <title>[TUT] How to download, set up, and fix a 317 client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-how-to-download-set-up-and-fix-a-317-client/305062</link>
    <description>Okay, this is my first tutorial, therefore it might be noob -.- but anyway, I see alot of people who generally have problems with downloading and running clients. There are also times where they get messages like &quot;Java is not recognised...&quot; which yes, is simple to fix, but hey, I thought I could post this to help...now I think this is what people normally do at the start of tutorials, so here we go!


Tutorial - How to download a client, get it running, and fix any errors!
Difficulty - 1/10   just do what I put here ;)
Credits - Well, I wrote it, took the screen shots, but I guess I learnt it from various places from the internet O.O so il give myself 70% credit,    and the rest to the kind people who taught me how do do this on.



Things you will need: (All links are in the tutorial)

THE LATEST VERSION OF JDK!

WINRAR




Firstly, click this link (THIS IS THE LINK TO MY PERSONAL CLIENT, BUT YOU CAN USE ANY, MOST, I BELIVE, ARE THE SAME: [url=http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?dilvjzmg2nz]http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?dilvjzmg2nz[/url]




Then click this link in the new window: 
[IMG]http://i269.photobucket.com/albums/jj75/eddybrown100/tut3.jpg[/img]




Once it has downloaded, you will need  [u]winrar[/u]. Here is the download link: http://www.rarlab.com/rar/wrar390.exe


Now you should be able to click  &quot;ZezimaLand Client V1.rar&quot;.

Once you have clicked it, it should look like this:
[IMG]http://i269.photobucket.com/albums/jj75/eddybrown100/tut4.jpg[/img]

Now extract it (Shown in picture) to where you want it to save.



Now you should have a folder in your chosen area. For me, its on my desktop. Simply open the folder, and it should look like this:
[IMG]http://i269.photobucket.com/albums/jj75/eddybrown100/tut5.jpg[/img]




When you click run.bat, a command prompt will pop up saying this:
[IMG]http://i269.photobucket.com/albums/jj75/eddybrown100/tut6.jpg[/img]




Just minimize it, and then the client should pop up, and now you can play! :D

To close the client, just close the batch file that popped up.




Now, for the problems...

IF:

It says &quot;Java isnt recognised as an internal or external command&quot; or somthing like that, follow this guide below...or if it says anything else that it shouldnt lol...



Download the latest JDK (Java Development Kit)

Now, all you have to do is First we will need to download Java Sun&#39;s JDK.
Download the latest from here: [url=http://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/VerifyItem-Start/jdk-6u16-windows-i586.exe?BundledLineItemUUID=_QZIBe.mQpMAAAEjWqkPhP0S&amp;OrderID=cMlIBe.m2w8AAAEjUKkPhP0S&amp;ProductID=bhJIBe.ptbMAAAEishcTvuC_&amp;FileName=/jdk-6u16-windows-i586.exe]http://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/VerifyItem-Start/jdk-6u16-windows-i586.exe?BundledLineItemUUID=_QZIBe.mQpMAAAEjWqkPhP0S&amp;OrderID=cMlIBe.m2w8AAAEjUKkPhP0S&amp;ProductID=bhJIBe.ptbMAAAEishcTvuC_&amp;FileName=/jdk-6u16-windows-i586.exe[/url]

Okay, now install it.




Now you will need to make your pc recognise Java...

So you will need to get to system settings, do this:

Click start ---&gt; Control Panel ---&gt; System


Now click the  ADVANCED   tab, then click Environment Variables.


Click &quot;add&quot; under &quot;User Variables&quot;.

Name it &quot;CLASSPATH&quot; and for the &quot;Variable Value&quot; put this in: CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_14\bin;%CLASSPATH%;


Click new again, the same one under &quot;User Variables&quot;

Name it &quot;PATH&quot; and for the &quot;Variable Value&quot; put this in: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_14\bin


Now just click ok, ok, ok ect, and now your computer recognises Java! Try clicking run.bat again. If it doesen&#39;t work, post here and I will try and help out.


Hope this helps someone out there!
