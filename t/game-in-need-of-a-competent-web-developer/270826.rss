    <title>Game in need of a competent web developer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/game-in-need-of-a-competent-web-developer/270826</link>
    <description>A friend of mine is working on a game, and I shit you not: it&#39;s a MORPG. Their current web developer has been doing quite an unsatisfactory job, so the team is looking for a new person to replace him. I know there are quite a few competent web developers here, so if you are interested, please PM me.
Your duties will include

[ul][li]Designing, implementing and improving the PHP backend for the site[/li]
[li]Administering the MySQL database[/li]
[li]Administering the community forums[/li]
[li]Maintaining some of the content on the site[/li][/ul]

Most of this stuff has already been implemented, however, ideally we would like a complete rewrite of the web site&#39;s code base (it&#39;s not that big tbh).
A few more details about the game:
It&#39;s quite far along in the development stage, we were aiming for an April release date, but it looks like it will be pushed up to some time this summer.
The game is written in Java, and already has a small community around it.
If you are interested, have a strong knowledge of PHP, and can work well in a team environment, please send me a PERSONAL MESSAGE and I will give you more details.</description>
