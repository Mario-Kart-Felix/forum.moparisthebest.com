    <title>Development: LuredScape V1 Source!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/development-luredscape-v1-source/218840</link>
    <description>Hey Everyone!  Well after several attempts at running a no-ip server i successfully FAILED  :(. So i decided to put my amatuer coding skills to the test by making my own source! I&#39;m not sure how it will go but i will take it one thing at a time and hopefully succeed. If it all works out i will glady post it in the &quot;downloads&quot; forum for everyone to use!
NEWS: Fixed my &quot;runserver&quot;! Staring project now!  :)

[u][b]The Approach:[/b][/u] I will be taking FigmentScape V4.5 and be changing just about everything! From new shops, training areas and even a never before seen Multi Pking area!

Red = Not Complete
Orange = In Progress
Green = Complete

[u][b]Future Updates:[/b][/u]
~New Non-leeched home!~
~New Training Area~
~New Shops~
~New Multi Pking Area! (Never before seen)~
~New Staff Zone~
And more to come!

[u][b]My Resources![/b][/u]
- MoparScape Forums -


As i said before, i am semi-new to coding and will need tons of help along the way! Thankyou everyone beforehand! Also a special thanks to Figment and his V4.5 Source! (yes, i will give him credit for this project of mine)

With all that said, my adventure begins now! Thank you for reading! :)

P.S. Feel free to post suggestions on locations for anything.

<p>Also, your future update list isn’t a lot, but anywho good luck I guess. You shouldn’t need any help yet, though whatever floats yer boat (less people who help and more you make yourself - more creds to you, right? heh).</p>
