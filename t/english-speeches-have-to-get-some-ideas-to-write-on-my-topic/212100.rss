    <title>English speeches have to get some ideas to write on my topic</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/english-speeches-have-to-get-some-ideas-to-write-on-my-topic/212100</link>
    <description>OK I have to present a speech for English and it has to be on &quot;How to...&quot;
It can be anything as long as it&#39;s not offensive/inapropriate

So for my speech I chose &quot;How to cause trouble&quot;

So I need some ideas/ways to cause trouble and getting away with it I mean everyone knows how to cause trouble so I won&#39;t get such a good mark if I say general things like &quot;put gum under desk&quot; I want to be creative and give awesome ideas that people will want to try and stuff

So if you have a good idea please share it with me all ideas are appreciated :)</description>
