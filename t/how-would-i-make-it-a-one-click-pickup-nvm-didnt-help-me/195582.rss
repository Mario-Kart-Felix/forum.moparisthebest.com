              <p>This basically makes picking items from the floor the same as Runescapes (Private servers usually don’t let you pick up the item unless you click on while standing on it)<br>
[/B][/I]</p>
<p>Purpose: To add 100% real ground pickups!</p>
<p>Difficulty: 2</p>
<p>Assumed Knowledge: Basic java and how to declare</p>
<p>Server Base: I made this on my project SkattyScape, but it should work on p16 or Pimpscape.</p>
<p>Classes Modified: client.java</p>
<p>Procedure:</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>In process() (your 500ms boolean) add</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">scanPickup();</code></pre>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>Find your pickup item packet</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">case 236:</code></pre>
<p>and replace the contents of it with</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">				int itemY = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();
				int itemID = inStream.readUnsignedWord();
				int itemX = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();
				apickupid = itemID;
				apickupx = itemX;
				apickupy = itemY;</code></pre>
<p>It should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">				case 236: //pickup item
				int itemY = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();
				int itemID = inStream.readUnsignedWord();
				int itemX = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();
				apickupid = itemID;
				apickupx = itemX;
				apickupy = itemY;
				break;</code></pre>
<p>Now declare all this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int apickupid = -1;
public int apickupx = -1;
public int apickupy = -1;

public void scanPickup()
{
if (absX == apickupx &amp;&amp; absY == apickupy)
{
if (ItemHandler.itemExists(apickupid, absX, absY))
{
int itemAmount = ItemHandler.itemAmount(apickupid, apickupx, apickupy);
if (addItem(apickupid, itemAmount))
{//only removes the item when has enough space!
ItemHandler.removeItem(apickupid, apickupx, apickupy, itemAmount);
removeGroundItem(apickupx, apickupy, apickupid);
apickupid = -1;
apickupx = -1;
apickupy = -1;
}
}
else if (hasntLoggedin){
sendMessage("Too late, its gone!");
apickupid = -1;
apickupx = -1;
apickupy = -1;
}
}
}
public boolean hasntLoggedin = false;</code></pre>
<p>Now in your loading packet <code>case 121:</code> add</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">hasntLoggedin = true;</code></pre>
<p>And your done!</p>
<p>This includes the, “Too late, its gone!” message, and it only removes the item from the ground when you have free inventory space.</p>

              <p>You might be thinking of “object click one” which handles the first row of options, or your first click on an object.</p>
<p>There is a simple fix to this somewhere, that’s  if you’re talking about how you click an item on the ground and it immediately walks to it and picks it up?</p>
