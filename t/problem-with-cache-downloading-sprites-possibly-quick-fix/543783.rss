    <title>Problem with Cache downloading sprites? Possibly quick fix!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-cache-downloading-sprites-possibly-quick-fix/543783</link>
    <description>Edit: I&#39;ve now got the cache downloader to work, and even managed to make a jar (FINALLY)! 

The only problem I have now is that when I open the jarred client, or the client in my IDE the sprites folder isn&#39;t being read as I have a black textbox and inventry (the files aren&#39;t being used)

I zipped the sprites folder up inside the cache before I uploaded the cache to dropbox - should I have done this? Or should I be uploading the sprite folder seperately and using a spritedownloader.java to access the files?

Please help!</description>
