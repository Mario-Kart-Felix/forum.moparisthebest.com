    <title>Should these monitors provide amplification?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-these-monitors-provide-amplification/472742</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got a pair of these monitors: http://www.behringer.com/EN/Products/B2031A.aspx (Behringer TRUTH B2031A)

I know absolutely nothing about audio engineering so don&#39;t know if these monitors (or any studio monitors) are supposed to provide amplification. Like if you buy an all-in-one speaker set (like Bose or something) it amplifies the tiny headphone jack signal. The website does say they are amplified, but there&#39;s no volume knob so I don&#39;t really understand how this works.. will they just amplify to the max and I&#39;m supposed to turn the computer volume down?

The reason I can&#39;t just test them is because the circuits are apparently damaged (they&#39;re not mine, and quite old), so I don&#39;t know if the quiet sound I&#39;m getting is due to lack of amplification or just because they&#39;re broken.

tldr; I want to connect these to my computer, should they amplify for me??</description>

              <p>Ignore the guy above, yes these monitors do contain their own amplifier - that’s what the A in the name refers to, they are active monitors rather than passive.</p>
<p>There may be a volume control on the back with the shelf controls etc., if not you’re probably expected to control it from your mixer.</p>
<p>EDIT: There is indeed a control on the back - it’s labelled ‘Input Trim’.</p>

<p>Same with guitar cabinets. Guitar cabinets don’t work standalone - they need a head (or other source) to power them.</p>
