    <description>hi im using a delta server and many people have told me theres many ways of duping.
I want a code that will stop every way and will also tell all mods and admins which are on or when they are on that this player has tried to dupe. And also if they try the items they try to dupe with will be deleted.

Thanks add my msn aswell : humzaali88@hotmail.co.uk</description>
