    <description>Alright so I&#39;m attempting to get my auto cache downloader to work, and it downloads and unzips the cache just fine. I thought I was golden and then BAM! this happened..  I&#39;ve tried going through the code but if anyone would like to snippets of what I have I&#39;d be glad to provide it. Thank you</description>
