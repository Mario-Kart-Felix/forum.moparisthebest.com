    <description>Submitted by a member who wished to remain anonymous:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Moderation rant:
[hr]
I know several users on the forums believe that there are already too many staff members. While I can relate and see where they are coming from you have to consider as well several factors. 

[b]Voluntary work[/b] 
These are members of the community who are willing to give up their time to help move, lock, ban, and overall clean up what we and others mess up. They don&#39;t have to do the job, but somebody has to do it and if we aren&#39;t willing to do it can we really argue? I think it&#39;s fair to say we can&#39;t really and truly expect too much out of the staff as they are not being paid for their efforts. 

[b]Real life[/b]
This is a given with anybody especially those in college +. Time is precious and as you get older there is more to do overall. While in high school (or for certain members no names... Middle School!) life is easier for the most part. 

[b]Why does it take so long?[/b]
I asked myself this when I was typing this up originally. The only answers I could really come up with were the two above and also the factor that sometimes the specialty of the report may require certain knowledge that or perhaps a certain moderator who reads the report may not have the power to do certain actions. 

[hr]
So what am I trying to say? I guess what I am trying to say is...go easy on the staff. They are doing the best they can with the resources they have already. Will there be more staff in the future? Only the administration really knows and it isn&#39;t up to us to decide. Is it fair for us to take away staff positions from the inactive users? I don&#39;t think that is right either. They work as a team and many of the ex staff are still active. Just because they don&#39;t go here a lot doesn&#39;t mean they at one point didn&#39;t deserve that title. Besides generally speaking, when a member of the staff goes inactive they inform the other staff members so they know about it. 

So guys what do you think? I say cut them some slack and let them sort things out more.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

Oh, and names of who submits things for us should have their names present in this board regardless. In this case, guessing it was Loveandpower was pretty easy, though. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Sounds like Loveandpower. Though I don’t really see the point, the addition of stuff like this sets the wrong precedent for other potential submissions. If you’re going to submit an article then it should be a work of yourself and tied to your name. The MM shouldn’t become an anonymous news board for those who invent issues that they can only solve in their own mind. I would turn down this submission and tell whoever it is to write about something that isn’t plastered all over the forum every time somebody has an issue, and simply because the idea of anonymous submissions is stupid. The only reason somebody would really submit an anonymous article is because the quality of the article would lower the value of their community reputation (as in it doesn’t fit the reputation they’ve established on the community), which means allowing anonymous submissions allows members to write to a standard that is sub par to what they would if they weren’t anonymous, so this would tell you that the explicit allowance of anonymous submissions would potentially increase submissions BUT the quality would lower of these submissions.</p>
