    <description>[s]Join a server through Hamachi? I mean, I understand you have to put the network name and password into Hamachi via &quot;Join Existing Network&quot; but how do you get onto the server? When I try to join Hamachi servers, it always gives me that gay &quot;Error connecting to server&quot; message...

Can someone explain Hamachi to me? :([/s]

Could a Mod lock this for me please? Thanks!
