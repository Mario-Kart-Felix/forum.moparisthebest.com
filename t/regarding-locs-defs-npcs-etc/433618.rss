    <title>Regarding Locs/Defs/Npcs etc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/regarding-locs-defs-npcs-etc/433618</link>
    <description>Probably going to regret posting this, but i havn&#39;t attempted looking at a source properly since 2008. I&#39;m not full of java knowledge however, I can interpret programming languages and don&#39;t normally having problems finding what i need to change to fix/change something. However, I&#39;m completely stumped as the last time i worked on things like &quot;shops.xml&quot; they had the item id the amount and price, now it has a price modifier.

So the problems are as below if anybody could kindly point me in the correct directions ( the source is an easyrsc, i have a feeling it one somebodys edited and cocked up maybe, but not sure. )

1. I cannot purchase ammulets out of edge store when i click buy nothing happens, however it lets me purchase the manta rays and another random item in there.

2. Does anybody have a master fisher.java? I have atleast 4 different sources and not one have this. However the npc exists in-game

3. Another issue I&#39;m having is when trying to unpack loading.rscd it gives me an error &quot;error opening zip file&quot; and then below that line just says &quot;null&quot;. However it lets me unpack sprites.rscd etc

There the three off the top of my head i am having problems with at the moment. For the first one I&#39;m sure a price may need changing somewhere or a value of some sort just which and where is the question.

Much appreaciated if somebody can drop a message or two with a helpful answer.

<p>Use 7zip or another program,  replace the client loc with the loc from server-side.</p>
