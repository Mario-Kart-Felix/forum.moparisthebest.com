    <title>Looking to start a server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-start-a-server/544954</link>
    <description>I have no clue what section this went under so I just decided to put it here. I&#39;m looking to start a project and I&#39;m just wondering what should I use to start? I&#39;m just looking to learn and just wondering which is the best to learn off. A clean source and client PI? Or what?


Thanks,

<p>if you were to do a bad source think of it as a learning experience that you will scrap one day rather than a genuine project</p>
