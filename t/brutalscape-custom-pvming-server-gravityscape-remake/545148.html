        <p>Hey guy’s basically people will flame me saying ‘’ how could you try and remake such a pathetic server’’ or '‘why would u even try to remake such a server?’'<br>
Etc etc so what i LOVED about the server was that it was always so amazing with he customs and the zones and the amazing interfaces, so i had help actually making this beautiful art piece and finding the locations was the hardest bit and id have to say this server would be nothing like a remake if we didnt find the custom interfaces and commands etc and making the commands were kind of hard i must say but all in all what can you do i was coding this with 4 other players and friends so it was a much easier thing to do then just stay at home coding alone in the middle of the night for 12 hours straight am i right guys?<br>
Well anyways here we go!</p>
<p>Hey guys this is the owner of BurtalScape, The name’s Deniz. Anyways this is my brand new server. forums. <a href="http://www.brutalscape14.enjin.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.brutalscape14.enjin.com</a><br>
SCREENSHOT ALBUM - <a href="http://imgur.com/2K9H8Vp,DAaqYoZ,xS3squ0,OYjyr2m,zibrXoS,gZBw7rE,44lheK6,Cp6eBB1,9WmRzSK,RfzL4z4,qxu3Tva,kbPp3pk,gk7qFuY,EWWyfMr" rel="nofollow noopener">http://imgur.com/2K9H8Vp,DAaqYoZ,xS3squ0,OYjyr2m,zibrXoS,gZBw7rE,44lheK6,Cp6eBB1,9WmRzSK,RfzL4z4,qxu3Tva,kbPp3pk,gk7qFuY,EWWyfMr</a><br>
ABOUT THE OWNER.<br>
I am a very active owner that tries to make the server as enjoyable, and continuously enjoyable as possible for my players.<br>
BrutalScape is a brand new server and will soon be one of the most successful. The server has only just been released, yet with our improvements and fixes, BrutalScape is soon going to be a server everyone will remember and Enjoy.<br>
I am also regularly trying to find, and fix any bugs I come across, and think of new things to add to the server.<br>
I will probably be adding updates every week, and also fixing bugs or changing little things to be more accurate daily.<br>
Our community gives a warm welcome to all new players, and presents them with many opportunity to get involded with activities and get to know existing members and Staff. Anyone that joins will be flooded with welcomes and will be helped as much as they desire to be helped. So join BrutalScape<br>
Server Features:<br>
BrutalScape is an economy server<br>
This basically means there’s no spawning and any items people obtain will have been earned through PVM or from PKing. This means our items will have value, making everything more fun, giving players something to aim for and of course making it so much better when you finally get that kill for rare items. There are tons of different ways to exchange your items including specific market areas, clan chats, and even a section on forums. Being a new server we want to get our economy right the first time. To ensure we achieve this we have made drop rates at a perfect level to maintain item drops for PvMers, but also to give just enough that we’re not flooded with items and massive inflation like you see on most other private servers.</p>
<ul>
<li>PVP COMBAT - Perfect clipped following. Clipped projectiles for both ranged and magic. Perfect max hit, and attack/defense formulas. All specials working with correct effects for all weapons vs players. Working curse prayers, and regular prayers. Uncheatable PvP point system. Chance of a PvP item drop when killing other players in the wild. Perfect animations, hit delays, weapon speeds.

<li>PVM COMBAT - Perfect clipped following, and walking for NPCs. Perfect attack styles, and emotes for all NPCs. All specials working with correct effects for all weapons vs npcs. Npcs don’t walk on top of one another. Can’t diagnal fight or stand on Npc. Multi barrage.<br>
Donate.<br>
Oke, first of all , All donations goes to make server better ddos protect,vps,banners…<br>

Superdonator-Superdonor cost 15 and benefits- Rank,access to go ::superzone Better drop rates + items what other npc-s doesnt drop and access to go donorzone.<br>
