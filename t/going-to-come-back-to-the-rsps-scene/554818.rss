    <title>Going to come back to the RSPS scene</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/going-to-come-back-to-the-rsps-scene/554818</link>
    <description>Hi guys,

It&#39;s been many years since i&#39;ve touched a RSPS for a tiny bit of self development getting used to Java programming. I&#39;m sure I am going to annoy everyone by this as I have attempted to search over the past week for some source to use as a project but I just don&#39;t know where to begin - i&#39;ve tried a few different sources varying from 562, 747 and 317 pi, all of which I have been able to pick up and do some reasonable edits which has given me a good idea on what I can potentially do.

What my question is to the community can someone give me a break down of the pros and cons about each and if i&#39;m to pick up a blank source what are the first couple of things i should focus on and if possible point out a good base ideally for a 317 as I have always liked that revision, and as well as a good base a blank clean source also, I know the search button is there but everything I have tried I don&#39;t like the feel of unfortunately so a clean blank source is probably the best bet.

I appreciate anyones help and i look forward to start contributing to the community once again.

Kind Regards

<p>tbh runesource was so simple you could write it up again in one day<br>
lare96 explained me how it works internally; here’s how it looks like:<br>
1 thread that executes every 600ms (main tick)<br>
1 thread for networking, accept connections, handle read ops, queue the events and trigger them on the main tick<br>
x threads for engine services</p>
<p>implement login protocol, packet decoding and voila, that’s pretty much where runesource left off</p>

              <p>Well, the con of almost every server it something is wrong with it and it’s a pain in the butt if your looking to learn don’t turn to rsps servers they are decent if you know the basics and just want to mess around but if you dive in without any preperation your going to waste years and never get anywhere.</p>
<p>The pro is there’s a lot of servers to choose from perhaps we can help you better if we know more about what your looking for although I will say this if your looking to learn and develop good coding practices and this is for you and not for your friends and not to have a rsps to play on with other random players then you should probably download and take a look at the source called “Apollo” there are some really nice names on the project and the code is absolutely beautiful you’ll learn a lot from it however it doesn’t look very pretty as it’s like oldschool 317 and it has virtually no content besides the game engine idk maybe the bank booth will open or something XD</p>
<p>If you’re looking for content then PI is good source you will be able to get players with it although the catch with PI is even though it has a lot of content it’s been passed through the hands of every 10 year old and wannabe coder in existence do not use this if your trying to learn and avoid making habits of writing the way the code has been written in PI its hideous and functions miserably.</p>
<p>If 718’s are your thing there is a source called rune evo vsomethingoranother anyways I used it before it looks very nice has particles and some solomons emotes the newer armors like drys hd graphics its very pretty ingame however the catch with this type of server is the cache is rather large as its a 718 players could spend upwards of 15 minutes loading your client for the first time.</p>

              <p>Runesource literally has login sequence and a couple packets implemented and it’s pretty straightforward in terms of design.<br>
Stonefall is based on Runesource and should have some more packets implemented and even a bit of content.<br>
Stay clear from any hyperion based servers, they’re overdesigned as hell.<br>
Anything with leetspeak, “pk” or “z” at the end of the sever’s name is, as per usual, guaranteed bs.</p>

              <p>Apollo is the best server.you could probably go for but its just a framework there are plenty of tutorials though. Your best bet is to download a load of bases you like thenlook of, try them out and just stick to the one that stands out the most for you. You will always find problems in every base that you think you can’t over come but you either have to accept it and stick with it or use some initiative and do some debugging. You can easily see what parts are making you DC by using println in your code</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>It’s been many years since i’ve touched a RSPS for a tiny bit of self development getting used to Java programming. I’m sure I am going to annoy everyone by this as I have attempted to search over the past week for some source to use as a project but I just don’t know where to begin - i’ve tried a few different sources varying from 562, 747 and 317 pi, all of which I have been able to pick up and do some reasonable edits which has given me a good idea on what I can potentially do.</p>
<p>What my question is to the community can someone give me a break down of the pros and cons about each and if i’m to pick up a blank source what are the first couple of things i should focus on and if possible point out a good base ideally for a 317 as I have always liked that revision, and as well as a good base a blank clean source also, I know the search button is there but everything I have tried I don’t like the feel of unfortunately so a clean blank source is probably the best bet.</p>
<p>I appreciate anyones help and i look forward to start contributing to the community once again.</p>
<p>Kind Regards<br>
Jarvis</p>
