    <title>Need help with Silabsofts client. :\</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-silabsofts-client/139148</link>
    <description>Ok, well I fixed my last problem with this client, and got it running.

At first, I got an error when I clicked run.bat

But now I can load the client up and play on it, but the new items show up.
The people are just invisible, just like the MoparScape 3.2 client.

I got a picture here of what the run.bat says when I click on it, it&#39;s under the Cache Modifications.


Here is the image.

Also, from what the error says, I [b][u]THINK[/u][/b] it&#39;s failing to download the Silabsoft modifications.
Also it says &#39; java.io.FileNotFoundException &#39; which I don&#39;t know what it means, unless it can&#39;t find a file...
Or if not, there has to be a different solution. :\
And it says &#39; The System cannot find the path specified &#39;
Which I don&#39;t know what that means. &gt;.&lt;
Yeah I&#39;m a nub lol.


It would be nice if someone were to help me.
If you know the solution, post or PM me. :)
If you would rather discuss it over MSN PM me and I&#39;ll tell you it.

Thank-you. :)</description>
