    <description>Hi !

You might think this is a stupid post, but for some of you it might be important. I&#39;m letting you know that i&#39;m going to be leaving soon after this letter. I&#39;m leaving my whole code career behind. Some of you are probably glad.

I&#39;ve got lots of Thanks to say, firstly Moparisthebest. Thankyou for your wonderful forum that gave me the code career of H++. Thankyou to Mod Taharok. Such a great man ! You said that you wanted to be a Mod, god heard you i guess. And lastly, thankyou to everyone for your help with FAQ.

Thankyou for your time.

Goodbye !</description>
