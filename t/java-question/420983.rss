    <title>[Java] Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-question/420983</link>
    <description>I have a question. What is cleaner/safer/better?

I have an ArrayList in the Properties class, but whats better to access it?

In the class this:
[code=java]
        private ArrayList&lt;MouseInformation&gt; list = Properties.getList();

	public void startMouse() {
		try {
			Robot r = new Robot();
			for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size(); i++)
				r.mouseMove(list.get(i).getX(), list.get(i).getY());
		} catch (AWTException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
[/code]

or in the method this.
[code=java]
public void startMouse() {
		try {
			Robot r = new Robot();
			for (int i = 0; i &lt; Properties.getList().size(); i++)
				r.mouseMove(Properties.getList().get(i).getX(), Properties.getList().get(i).getY());
		} catch (AWTException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
[/code]

Oh, and another question. Is there a class which sees if you are clicking right now? I don&#39;t mean mouse events, but some sort of event which sees if you click somewhere on the screen.</description>

Hey David, I did some tests, and it looks like using an Iterator is faster :D, then comes the foreach loop, and then a for loop.<br>

<p>Okay, thanks. Do you also know a class or some sort of event which sees if you clicked on the screen?</p>

<p>Why wouldn’t you use a mouse event on the frame… or whatever you are using as the active screen.<br>
[/quote]<br>
The active screen is my whole screen. There is no frame. Or panel, or any Component.[quote author=Davidi2 link=topic=523658.msg3809486#msg3809486 date=1320782461]<br>
That’s one of the fallbacks of programs that don’t use a native package (like .NET), there’s no way to hook those kinds of things without using JNI as far as I know.</p>
<p>However there are work arounds for almost everything, the simplest I can think of being a full screen window with opacity set at like 0.02f or whatever, and applying a mouse listener for that.</p>
<p>I could be mistaken and there’s a better way, but I haven’t looked into it.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I don’t really understand you. Look I’m making a programm which records your mouse movements and clicks. I got the movement recording working, but I don’t know how to see the if you clicked. If I can add an event to my whole screen(not a frame), how would I do it?[/quote]</p>
