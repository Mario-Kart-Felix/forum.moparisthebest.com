              <p>I changed the code picture, but what you would do, would be doing what a stregnth potion would do. Temporarily increase your level, but not the exp. So find this on a new char:</p>
<p>[SKILLS]<br>
character-skill = 0	1	0<br>
character-skill = 1	1	0<br>
character-skill = 2	1	0<br>
character-skill = 3	10	1155<br>
character-skill = 4	1	0<br>
character-skill = 5	1	0<br>
character-skill = 6	1	0</p>
<p>and change it to this:<br>
[SKILLS]<br>
character-skill = 0	100	0   &lt;&lt; Level 1 exp, with level 100 attack. - ADVANTAGE<br>
character-skill = 1	1	0<br>
character-skill = 2	1	0<br>
character-skill = 3	10	1155  &lt;&lt; level 10 exp, with level 10 hp. - NORMAL<br>
character-skill = 4	1	0<br>
character-skill = 5	1	0<br>
character-skill = 6	1	0</p>
<p>This player would have an advantage do to the temporarily increased skill you changed, but after death, if returns to normal. Did this help?</p>
