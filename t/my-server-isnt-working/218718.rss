    <title>My server isn&#39;t working!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-server-isnt-working/218718</link>
    <description>Okay first of all, I have hosted before and this has never happened.

Just to say, I can log on 0.0.0.0 but not on my ip i have set up (runelife.no-ip.biz) and i don&#39;t know what to do...

problem 1 - port forwarding gone wrong

Ok here is image to show u my port forward rule

problem 2 - no-ip is wrong (not sure how)

i don&#39;t think this can be wrong but oh well

problem 3 - the runserver

this is the least likely to be wrong but it says its only being hosted locally (letting only my computer log on) so might as well screenie it

problem 4 - the paths

they r up to date so its not them...</description>

Only reason i ever got mine working is because my computer messed up due to a storm and i had to do system recovery (ADVISE YOU NOT 2 YOU LOSE EVERYTHING ON YOUR COMPUTER)<br>
and it reset everything to factory shipped parts and it worked.</p>

              <p>Yes this happened to me before its something wrong with your envirmental variables but sorry i dont know how to fix try to login with 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>See if you can and if you can that means the server is only looping back to your ip so no1 else can login only you.</p>
<p>Sorry but thats all i know</p>
