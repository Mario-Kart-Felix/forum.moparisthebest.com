<p>Why should you choose to play Rune-Sanctum over other servers?</p>
<p>A very good question… But a very simple answer which is, Rune-Sanctum cares about it’s players, it cares about it’s economy, it cares about how the server is ran and what the players suggest and what they want. We do everything we possible can to ensure that the players of Rune-Sanctum/Rune-Honor enjoy playing the game and get the most friendly, fun and enjoyable game play they can!</p>
<p>The server does frequent and daily updates almost every day, you can view all/most of the updates that happen on Rune-Sanctum on the update-log on the forums. Rune-Sanctum focuses on every players enjoyment, we have every aspect of game-play that we know players enjoy PvM, PvP, skilling, you name it we have it! We are not like other servers which are ignorant to there players and just ignores there opinions and even ignores there players when they talk to them… I have played over 50 servers over the past 4 years and have watched very carefully how the best servers are ran and also how the bad servers are ran, I have learnt there mistakes and adapted to how the best servers are ran which is why Rune-Sanctum/Rune-Honor is the place for you.</p>
<p>Both of our servers are ran by Highly trained staff teams who do their best to make your enjoyment and your stay on the server we try our best to add daily game content to also make the server more competitive as well as weekly events where my staff team will fluoridate so we can all have decent fun!</p>
<p>We put time into FUN and ENJOYMENT!</p>

</li>
