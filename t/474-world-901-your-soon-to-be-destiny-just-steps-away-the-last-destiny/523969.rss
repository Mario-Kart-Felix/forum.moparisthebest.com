[b]A complete rewrite of this server coming soon![/b]

Hello, and welcome to the official World 901 thread. What is World 901 you may ask? World 901 is a relatively new RSPS based on the #474 revision. We look to provide fun, lasting content that will keep our users engaged. We also look to provide a great community so everyone can react friendly to one-another. All-in-all, we hope you enjoy a joyful experience.

World 901 is here to offer something different to the community. We DO NOT (and that&#39;s strictly a NOT) proclaim ourselves unique, nor will we. World 901 is here so you can see RuneScape a different way. Every idea is thought by the Owner Arham 4 and Co-Owner Andrew, and if they are thought by anyone else, they will be credited.

[center][url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/][img]http://puu.sh/4r5Nt.png[/img][/url][/center]

World 901, as of July 2nd, 2013, looks to provide an effort to the real world. 35% of our donations will be sent to [url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/]Doctors Without Borders[/url], which is a relief foundation for the whole world.

[size=18pt][b]Ideas[/b][/size]
[size=1]And we&#39;re still thinking (and making) them everyday![/size]

[img]http://puu.sh/4r6HO.png[/img][size=1] [b]If the idea has a star on it, it means that the idea is either highly-liked by people or it is a feature that we believe is awesome.[/b][/size]
[img]http://puu.sh/4r6Ds.png[/img][size=1] [b]If the idea has the ignore icon on it, it means that the idea is either at a standstill (for either not being able to complete) or that the idea is not really liked by the staff.[/b][/size]

Key:
[b]If the title is green, that means this has been completed.
If the title is orange, that means this is currently in progress.
If the title is red, that means this has not even been starter a single bit.[/b]

[u]The Wilderness[/u]
In normal RuneScape, when you are above level 20 wilderness, you may not teleport. While this is still true in World 901, there is another catch. The catch? You may not view your minimap above that level of the wilderness.

[img]http://puu.sh/3GZI8.jpg[/img][/center]

[u]No such thing as &#39;training areas&#39;[/u]
You know how, in a normal server, you&#39;ll see &#39;Beginner Training Area&#39;, &#39;Intermediate Training Area&#39;, and &#39;Hard Training Area&#39;. Or maybe perhaps you have seen that there is one &#39;training area&#39; that has a bunch of monsters just standing there. Does this look logical? My response, no.

So, what we thought is that, since you can teleport around the world, why not just scatter the NPCs and make the players find them?

[center][img]http://puu.sh/3A65E.jpg[/img][/center]

[img]http://puu.sh/4r6HO.png[/img] [u][b]The Start[/b][/u]
The Start is partly a tutorial, partly a starter kit, and partly a task system. When the player starts, they talk to the founder of the starting city, Yanille, who will, after a while, give you 25,000 coins to start out. He will then proceed by asking you if you&#39;d like to do a tutorial or not. Players have the option to say, &quot;Yes,&quot; or &quot;No,&quot; to the offer. 

If the player says, &quot;Yes,&quot; then they will be in a tutorial that is sort of similar to Tutorial Island, however, we are not on an island and we have only one instructor (Guard). At the end, the player will be redirected to do a task. The player MUST do the task or they may not get out of the city of Yanille. Now, if the player selects &quot;No,&quot; they will automatically be redirected to the task. 

The task is randomized from a list of them. They are all easy, such as maybe killing a Goblin, a Chicken, a Man, or maybe even thieving a Woman, or socializing by buying a beer at the bar. [i]This is just to remove people who are just account spammers.[/i]

[img]http://puu.sh/4r6HO.png[/img] [b][u]The New Wilderness - A reborn mystery land[/u][/b]
For many years the wilderness was though of as just a place of murder. Pointless murder. But World 901 has something to offer that is different. We have made a whole new concept for the wilderness. Its not pointless murder, its a historical landscape, reborn.

Long ago, before the Godwar Dungeon was made, a battle of the Gods took place. The battle was so intense, a whole land was reduced to rubble. Evil lurked the land there, as Zamorak had won the fight. As Zamorak stood, laughing so evilly, so bitterly, Guthix had come. Guthix had put Zamorak at rest, until Zamorak had again arised and terrorized the land of World 901. He had then become encapsulated inside the Godwars Dungeon. [i]Nobody knows where he was placed.[/i]

This land that was reduced to rubble then produced lava pits. People built upon this land and made a graveyard. But the people made a mistake. A builder had dug something inside the land. It was a strange aura that prevented anyone who walked passed it from teleporting and jammed their map. Man was saddened that day. The god Guthix had then emerged again to bring peace to the land. Guthix did all he could to stop this aura, but the most he could do was throw it further.

This land today is now called the Wilderness. Where had Guthix thrown the aura? He had thrown it into level 20 of the wilderness. Where is this aura exactly? [i]The world may never know.[/i]

[img]http://puu.sh/4r6HO.png[/img] [b][u]Add-ons to combat[/u][/b]
RuneScape&#39;s combat tends to be the same. Now we aren&#39;t looking to make a new EoC or anything, but we ARE looking to add some nice features.

If the player is using the [i]slash[/i] combat style, the player has a chance to make the opponent bleed. If the player is using Ranged, the player has a chance to make an arrow stuck in the opponent&#39;s skin. Also, if the player is using Ranged, and the combat style is [i]accurate[/i] then they have a more accurate chance of getting the arrow stuck in the opponents skin. The victim, in turn, will try every turn of theirs to get the arrow out until they succeed doing so. Now, I will summarize every possibility.

Combat Type (Melee or Ranged) --- Combat style (Stab, Accurate, Slash, etc.) --- Effect --- Percent chance for effect
[hr]
Melee --- Stab --- The ability to make the opponents Attack decrease by 2 - 5. --- 10%
Melee --- Slash --- The ability to make the opponent Bleed. --- 5%
Melee --- Crush --- Crush the player. Inflicting 1/8 of their health. --- 10%
Ranged --- Make an arrow stuck on the victim. --- 5%
[hr]
Effect --- Remedies
[hr]
Bleed --- Put a bandage on.
Having an arrow stuck on you --- Wear Magic Secateurs or wait for the effect to go away. Your player has a 70% chance of taking the arrow out themseves. However, if he does, it will hurt your player considerable damage.
Having a stat drained --- Drink a restore potion.
Having yourself get crushed --- Wearing something that neutralizes crush effect (chainbodies, or a sq shield, or defenders).

[img]http://puu.sh/4r6Ds.png[/img] [b][u]Day and Night System[/u][/b]
Imagine going through the land of Gielinor, and it is midnight. Imagine being able to get a blood rune at night bit a cosmic run in the day. Imagine walking around and then some random creature arises from the dead at night. This is the whole concept of the Day and Night system. 

Different areas have a different timing. So, for example, Falador could have night time yet Varrock could have day time.

[u]Transportation[/u]
Instead of teleporting, you can either walk, run, chariot, or simply teleport. This option interface will occur as soon as you click the teleport. Chariot is the fastest way of transportation, running is 3x slower, and walking is 2x slower than running. The time it takes is determined by tiles.

[center][img]http://puu.sh/42Ucm.jpg[/img][/center]

[u]Recoil[/u]
After doing a special attack, you get recoil damage. The damage itself is determined by what weapon did the special attack. The basic idea of it will be that it hits 25% of the damage given.

Now do note, only SOME weapons will have recoil, not all. Weapons like the barrelchest anchor, saradomin sword, and the armadyl godsword will have this effect. Simple things like the dragon dagger will NOT have this effect.

If the player kills the opponent from the special attack, there is no recoil damage.

[center][img]http://puu.sh/4raNg.jpg[/img][/center]

[u]Balfrug Kreeyath[/u]
A demon has been released. In the mystical world, he had been released by the Zamorakian god. BAlfrug Kreeyath, some say, is Zamorak&#39;s grandson. Whoever he is, he has one evil family heritage. One of pure... utter destruction!

[b]Teleportation[/b]
This boss is in a cave. Due to the small, but obstacle location, he can teleport around the cave, 4 different coordinates have been placed for this boss to teleport. This boss will teleport every 10 - 15 seconds.

[b]Healing[/b]
Every 3 minutes, this boss has the ability to heal itself, making it ideal for you to kill him with a team. If you single fight him, it took me, the guy who knows the exact coordinates of where this thing spawns, 3 minutes to fight him. Healing, as of now, has not been added, but if it was, lets just say I would&#39;ve had a hard time with him.

[b]Minions[/b]
This boss can generate minions at a rate of 20% every time this boss teleports.

[b]Movement Detection System[/b]
This boss can detect your movements and choose to either...
A) Teleport to a new location.
B) Stand and wait for you.

[img]http://puu.sh/4r6Ds.png[/img] [b][u]Giant Roc[/u][/b]
[size=1](Credits to enzo42)[/size]
Giant Roc, one gigantic bird. Her family is alongside her. She can blow you away to the corner of her lair and leave her babies to kill you. She can paralyze you and shatter your bones. She is one hell of a monster, coming to World 901.

[b]Blow Away[/b]
Giant Roc has the ability to blow you to the corner of her lair. She can then get her babies out to attack you. They&#39;ll be munching you for dinner if you aren&#39;t careful! You can also get paralyzed from this Blow Away, depending on how far it was.

[b]Minions[/b]
Giant Roc can spawn her babies (Baby Roc) and they can attack you at their will.

[u]Barrelchest[/u]
[size=1](Credits to enzo42)[/size]
Barrelchest, one gigantic robot. He was made from the evil of barrels, other nautical objects, and at least one brain. It is controlled by a brain with eyes floating in an unknown liquid in a glass dome. Attached to it are various nautical objects like a ship&#39;s wheel and a life-ring, and it uses an anchor as a weapon. 

[b]Abilities[/b]
Barrelchest will attempt to hit players directly with its anchor, but if it can&#39;t reach the player, it will slam its anchor into the ground, causing an earthquake (Range, Magic) which may deal up to 8 damage. It drains some of your Prayer with every hit, and can also disrupt prayer entirely. Barrelchest will also drain your Defence.

[u]Glod[/u]
[size=1](Credits to enzo42)[/size]
Glod is a huge, monster who only uses Melee. Glod is like any typical boss, you just go in and fight. He has the ability to disable any active Prayers on the player, also lowering their prayer points by a noticeable amount, however, he doesn&#39;t have any of those special, fancy stuff like all the other bosses, and is not much of a &#39;hard boss&#39; compared to the other bosses of World 901.

[img]http://puu.sh/4r6HO.png[/img] [u][b]World 901 - The Minigame[/b][/u]
Runescape&#39;s worst rulebreakers are put in to World 901, an abandoned and corrupt version of Draynor Village. Only one can survive and win their freedom...

[b]Idea[/b]
As soon as you start, a player named &#39;Host&#39; will arrive. He will say in all the contestants chat (like dialogue), &quot;Welcome, to World 901 - The Minigame. however_many_people_are_in_the_minigame of the world&#39;s greatest rulebreakers in the game have been put in this minigame, in order to prove who is the best player. The winner will receive an immense reward, and the rest, will receive a small reward for trying. We wish you luck.&quot;

Of course, the contestants aren&#39;t really &#39;the world&#39;s greatest rulebreakers in the game&#39;, that&#39;s just to copy the World 901 movie.

[b]Location[/b]
The location of this minigame will be in a fake Draynor Village.

[b]&#39;Contestants Remaining&#39;[/b]
Instead of making it typically that the counter stays on with the &#39;Contestants Remaining&#39;, we will make it appear on the screen every time a person dies. So, for example, there are 20 players in the minigame. The &#39;Contestants Remaining&#39; will appear on the screen for 5 minutes, then it will go away. Player 20 dies, so for all the 19 contestants remaining, the &#39;Contestants Remaining&#39; will appear on the screen for another 5 seconds, and then it will go away.

We are doing this for 2 reasons:

[ol][li]The World 901 movie did this.[/li]
[li]We find that it will make more &#39;suspense&#39;.[/li][/ol]


[center][youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq7k9_iGfXQ[/youtube][/center]

[u]Knights[/u]
[size=1](Credits to Docent)[/size]
Knights is a new minigame inspired by Docent&#39;s server [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,647956.0.html]Knights![/url]. The player will start off with bronze armour and will have to find better armour in a relatively-medium sized cave. The max armour possible is White/Black. When you start, you are automatically chosen if you are a White knight or a Black knight.

[u]Gilded Smithing[/u]
[size=1](Credits to Zeanr (also known as Sibor))[/size]
You can now smith gilded armour! You must have a special gold amulet that is only a rare drop of the hardest of monsters. This amulet will be used also while making a gilded item also.

[u]Item Messages[/u]
This system is for items that are 100k or higher when they are dropped. Its a message with the item dropped on the left side.

^ By the way, this is not the real price of the Armadyl Godsword. I just made that as a filler.[/center]

The Central Trading Hub

The Central Trading Hub is located in Falador&#39;s garden and is the new trading area. You may still trade anywhere, but think of it like this. You&#39;re trying to find something and you can&#39;t find anyone that has it. Go to the Central Trading Hub then!

              <p>Due to failed QA team, lack of communication, and lack of contenet, this server is being discontinued and the website disbanded. We hope this isn’t a shocker, as the support for it has been dwindling these last few weeks and we’re sorry if anything is new to you.</p>
<p>We thank you all for the support and motivational words that were said towards the end. We (the team) is going to use this as a learning experience for our upcoming projects. We hope you stay tuned for our upcoming servers, as they will be better and newer than this one, with the same idea as putting the community first and our new ideas into action.</p>
<p>Think of this as a “test project”. You are the most important one, the patient. We tried all our best, the developers learning tons and tons (and walking out of this project with more knowledge than they had ever seen before (or knew they could have), and this project served us well. We have collected the pros and cons from what we see that we did wrong as a staff team.</p>
<p>Please, <span class="bbcode-b">do not</span> see this as a typical “we quit” message, but as a reminder that YOU, the reader, and you supporters, played a role in our lives. We now know our mistakes, we know know our strengths and weaknesses, and we walk out of World 901, your soon to be destiny, just steps away, with new, profound knowledge both in leadership and programming knowledge.</p>
<p>So no, we the staff have not quit. See this as a building block. You helped us achieve a building block of our server. We learned from our (I and Arham) previous server, FroyoScape, that finance plays a huge role of epic proportions! And now, we walk away with World 901 with a new lesson, one we had over-looked so long ago, that communication with your team and activity with the combination of motivation builds the factor of success.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for your support. World 901 wouldn’t have been anything without it’s fans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Owner Arham, Co-Owner Andrew, and the rest of World 901 staff (Past, and present.)</li>

Starting over will make this a lot better from what I see. Those people who had 99s in my server? I have their Skype. They told me it was quite boring once they got 99s. And then they quit…</p>
<p>I literally had no playerbase at the end, as my dedicated players got caught up with exams and studies.</p>
<p>I want to start over. I made tons of mistakes with this server. I never did the proper stages of development. Instead, I did development stage, private beta, public beta.</p>
<p>I never made a proper tutorial at the start. Idk how I expected users to grasp the game.</p>
<p>I never added proper training areas. People in-turn just trained on anything they saw.</p>
<p>I never added that The Start idea, though it was the most vital thing this server needed, as it provided access to the fairy ring and would replace all training teleports with special codes.</p>
<p>I never set my prioties right. I rushed to public beta in anger of my beta testers. Did anyone, even I, expect that public beta release I magically popped out of nowhere?</p>
