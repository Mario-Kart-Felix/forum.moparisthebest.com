        <p>concept of prestige:</p>
<p>normal xp rate = 25x or some random number<br>
prestige once, xp rate is now a percentage slower, or simply one multiplier.</p>

2nd = 23x<br>
3rd = 22x<br>
…<br>
22nd = 3x<br>
23rd = 2x<br>
24th = 1x</p>
<p>or do .5x lower or some crap.</p>
<p>so training gets harder and harder, but you can choose to prestige or not.</p>
<p>this allows you to take account for prestige level of skills, and offer specific bonuses to the player. perhaps non-tradable items that give special bonuses in some skills?</p>
<p>like a “molten pick axe” chance of smelting the ore you mine, and giving you 2x the mining experience, and smithing exp for that ore.<br>
“serpent rod” chance of catching any fish from any fishing spot, etc.<br>
“inaudible gauntlets” ability to thieve any npc in game that has a drop table. all rates at slashed into quarters. (if it’s 50% chance to receive item from killing, you will have 12.5% chance to get it from thieve)</p>
<p>etc etc</p>
<p>more ideas if you like. just hmu with a message or some shit.</p>

Thanks for the support everyone!  ;D Also, our first priority is adding the basic stuff a 317 should have, all skills etc. But if anyone has any unique content suggestions please don’t hesitate to let us know!<br>
[/quote]interactive player support. all global world entities are thus instanced of the player.</p>
<p>cutting down a tree remains cut forever (or for a long time) and tree must then be farmed by the player (given proper levels)</p>
<p>fishing spots have a given amount of fish (oceans will clearly have more than a river) and once ‘depleted’ fish will no longer be accessible --&gt; implement systems for ‘tasks’ or ‘quests’ to be able to travel to further lands and find more fishing locations.</p>
<p>mining will provide more ore per rock, but thus remove the ore permanently from the game. players must find hidden ‘resource’ dungeons which will be randomized through different game ‘tunnels’ and each one will spawn different ores / amounts per players -&gt; this way older players cannot sell out locations for higher level ores.</p>
<p>theiving can be done on any human entity (npcs and players) - npcs will loot one of their random drops, players will loot a small percentage of their wealth (calculated both from their bank and inventory) if a player has no wealth, you cannot steal from them. *note to steal from other players, you must be in pvp enabled zones, so they may defend their wealth, or you must have 99 theiving.</p>

        <p>Due to failed QA team, lack of communication, and lack of contenet, this server is being discontinued and the website disbanded. We hope this isn’t a shocker, as the support for it has been dwindling these last few weeks and we’re sorry if anything is new to you.</p>
<p>We thank you all for the support and motivational words that were said towards the end. We (the team) is going to use this as a learning experience for our upcoming projects. We hope you stay tuned for our upcoming servers, as they will be better and newer than this one, with the same idea as putting the community first and our new ideas into action.</p>
<p>Think of this as a “test project”. You are the most important one, the patient. We tried all our best, the developers learning tons and tons (and walking out of this project with more knowledge than they had ever seen before (or knew they could have), and this project served us well. We have collected the pros and cons from what we see that we did wrong as a staff team.</p>
<p>Please, <span class="bbcode-b">do not</span> see this as a typical “we quit” message, but as a reminder that YOU, the reader, and you supporters, played a role in our lives. We now know our mistakes, we know know our strengths and weaknesses, and we walk out of World 901, your soon to be destiny, just steps away, with new, profound knowledge both in leadership and programming knowledge.</p>
<p>So no, we the staff have not quit. See this as a building block. You helped us achieve a building block of our server. We learned from our (I and Arham) previous server, FroyoScape, that finance plays a huge role of epic proportions! And now, we walk away with World 901 with a new lesson, one we had over-looked so long ago, that communication with your team and activity with the combination of motivation builds the factor of success.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for your support. World 901 wouldn’t have been anything without it’s fans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Owner Arham, Co-Owner Andrew, and the rest of World 901 staff (Past, and present.)</li>

        <p>[quote=“ox random xi, post:504, topic:523969”]Due to failed QA team, lack of communication, and lack of contenet, this server is being discontinued and the website disbanded.

<p>We thank you all for the support and motivational words that were said towards the end. We (the team) is going to use this as a learning experience for our upcoming projects. We hope you stay tuned for our upcoming servers, as they will be better and newer than this one, with the same idea as putting the community first and our new ideas into action.</p>
<p>Think of this as a “test project”. You are the most important one, the patient. We tried all our best, the developers learning tons and tons (and walking out of this project with more knowledge than they had ever seen before (or knew they could have)), and this project served us well. We have collected the pros and cons from what we see that we did wrong as a staff team.</p>
<p>Please, <span class="bbcode-b">do not</span> see this as a typical “we quit” message, but as a reminder that YOU, the reader, and you supportors, played a role in our lives. We now know our mistakes, we know know our strengths and weaknesses, and we walk out of World 901, your soon to be destiny, just steps away, with new, profound knowledge both in leadership and programming knowledge.</p>
<p>So no, we the staff have not quit. See this as a building block. You helped us achieve a building block of our server. We learned from our (I and Arham) previous server, FroyoScape, that finance plays a huge role of epic proportions! And now, we walk away with World 901 with a new lesson, one we had over-looked so long ago, that communication with your team and activity with the combination of motivation builds the factor of success.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for your support. World 901 wouldn’t have been anything without it’s fans.</p>

<p>even if you had 50 different people that posted (which also isn’t reallly significant enough to warrant that type of demeanor in the post), the number that actually still care and follow the project is even more miniscule <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Not that it really matters or that I want to argue about how many people followed your project, I was just pointing out how I found that post quite funny</p>
