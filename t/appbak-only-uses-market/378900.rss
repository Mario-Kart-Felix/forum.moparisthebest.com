    <title>AppBak only uses Market</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/appbak-only-uses-market/378900</link>
    <description>Hello. I wanted to thank you first for developing AppBak and for releasing it as free software. It has been included in the F-Droid project which aims to make a competitor to market but only listing free software. One issue with AppBak is that when it restores apps it only uses the Market to download the apps. Are you interested in either adding support to download from the F-Droid repo or would you allow that feature to be added to the program if it were coded by someone else?

Feel free to drop by http://www.f-droid.org/ or #fdroid on irc.freenode.net if you are interested. I&#39;ll also set myself to get notified about this since your forum supports it!

Thanks,

<p>Anyway, that actually looks like a great project, and I’d be happy to support it.  So are there links the user can click to install from the F-Droid repo?  Or better yet a way I could automatically script the restoration?  (not possible with android market).  I’ll probably drop by your IRC channel soon.</p>
