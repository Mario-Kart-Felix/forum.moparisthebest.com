It would involve a rewrite of all the rendering, sound, and input.  Not many here are capable of it.</p>

              <p>Good luck finding someone who would spend their time trying to get it to work… I’m sure its possible, but probably not worth it in the end. Everyone would want it to be free on the app store. At least I only download free apps, most apps seem like a waste of money to me. For it to be free they would need some massive advertisement and I’m sure its near impossible to make a free app for a 13 year old game.</p>
