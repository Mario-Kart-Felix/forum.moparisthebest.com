              <p>The main reason I dislike that place is because AliasXNeo is a real asshole. I’m not sure his position on the site all I know is he is an admin there. He thought he was making a difference by reporting kaitnieks to jagex and stuff XD But I remember tuning him up but he still thought he was all godly. He was pissed because the autorefresher was posted there.</p>
<p>But yeah, for the most part neocodex is THE neopets cheating website. [br][size=1]Posted at: November 05, 2006, 07:15:08 PM[/size][hr]LMFAO!!!<br>

Not sure if you guys remember, but iruleatants was a really big spammer/flammer/liar here on these forums.

 2. We don't talk about things we don't know. This is informative, not misinformative community.
 3. We don't make spelling mistakes on purpose. We use "you" not "u", we use "why" not "y" etc.
 4. [b]We don't make posts that contain unuseful information. Posts like "cool", "lol", "yeah" and "I agree" don't contain anything useful for others.[/b] We are not fans of offtopic, unless it contains something smart or funny. Most of things spammers find funny are actually not funny at all.

 8. We don't care about post count alone. If someone has high post count and most of it is spam, we hate him. If someone has high post count with informative posts, we love him. The higher count, the more we hate/love him.
 9. We don't talk about "rep" ever, whether you are asking for it or saying that you have given it.
 10. DO NOT post or upload any copyrighted materials, ie deobs, clients or any other sort (however if you were to link to a file that was uploaded somewhere else or post code in the pasteBin, well, I would have no control over that right? Wink )
 11. We don't sell anything on these forums with the exception of SCAR scripts.
 12. We never have misleading links in your signatures.  If your signature says www.google.com, we expect it to take us to google.com.
 13. Nothing to do with private servers belongs on moparisthebest.com, use moparisthebest.com for these things.</blockquote>
<p>Though I don’t know about rule 7 (wheather or not neocodex is approved or not).</p>
<p>I know Rule 4 and 6 have probably been invoked, James, I don’t know why you put that post there…</p>
<p>Oh yesh, if rule 7 is not active here, I have to say, I think I remember NeoCodex, it was a bit too err… complicated for me … <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
