    <title>What Happened!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-happened/552723</link>
    <description>Hey folks!  I&#39;m sure there will still be some old timers around here who remember me.

What in the hell happened to our forums!?  MITB to be precise, I was never a fan of MoparScape to begin with.

I get that they merged, so that was a genius idea.  Lets take an entire forum that the majority of users from another forum despise and just merge them together.  That should help get people to stay and new people to join!  *sarcasm*

In seriousness though, what happened!?  This used to be a bustling place, filled with the most up-to-date client knowledge and information sharing around.  This place, atleast MITB, used to teach the essentials of client hacking openly and freely to everyone (so long as we didn&#39;t feel like being elitest assholes to you, then you were kinda fudgeed, but hey it was all in good fun!).

Well I&#39;m at it, not that I really care at this point, but what happened to my CM status :( ?

I suppose I might as well make this post a goodbye for anyone who is still around to read it.  Some good memories I shared with a lot of you, and I wish each of you all the best in the future!

Cheers!

Wow, seriously?  A forum censor?</description>

I’m clapping, PaulT. That was quite a read! Really, I like the community here and lurk quite often. However, my only negativity towards the site is how hostile the community is. I’ve been preaching this, but am merely disregarded - and nobody makes an attempt. Regardless of that matter, I completely agree with everything that you’ve said. Though, regarding said matter, is the reason I’m not entirely active.</p>
<p>Also, you mentioned Google and vaguely implied it - so, if I may, do you work there?<br>
[/quote]I don’t know why people keep talking about hostility, I honestly never see it anymore. Most of the elitists have now either gotten over themselves or left. Retard.[/quote]You don’t see it anymore because everyone else is gone.</p>

don’t take things like that so personally bro, when I was like 12 years old and i first joined i used to say i hated this website because people talked to me like that. its the internet</p>
<p><span class="mention">@op</span>: yeah i agree with justin, im not sure if it’s because im older and not an idiot now or because the community got nicer but for the most part i notice everyone is less hostile towards each other</p>

              <p>I actually have no idea what the negative comments are about in this thread. The whole experience of community is about that one magical moment when you realize that you no longer need, or even want anything, from your peers, but you only want to help and serve them. When everybody is functioning at this higher level, projects materialize where previously only sketchy ideas flopped, and relationships grow out of the fertile soil of voluntary association.  In school you are assigned a group for a project, but when you are free to choose on your own, there are massively different results. Google knows this, which is why they give their employees a significant portion of their work week to go wander around the building and develop whatever they want with whoever they want.</p>
<p>As far as this community goes, if you don’t like way it turned out, you have two options. Either you can revitalize the community and BE the change you wish to see (and our best members routinely do this) or you can leave, and find your own or found your own Moparia.</p>
<p>I still come around because, well, I genuinely like you guys. There are always intrresting ideas, new snippets of code. PWNed always has a new haircut. People are always fighting over ridiculous pedantic crap.</p>
<p>The sands of time will always erode our sense of playfulness and our energy for those beloved activites that the world scoffs at,  and the unforgiving grind of work and duty may tear apart our fragile bonds of community, forged in cold cyberspace, but the truth is that the Universe is made of pure information and our generation was the first to use it to build our worlds, to manifest our imagination into the screen, the temple where the Godhead of consciousness comes to meet the vulgar eyes of the Neophyte, he is the eternal student, the Phoenix of life rising from the prison of matter.</p>
<p>You know what happened? We won. The world belongs to the creators, like Notch, Elon Musk, people who never fit the mold and never cared. Even Jagex has been forced to host the very Old School Server they tried to kill, their OSRS server is dated roughly to WinterLoves client. So wake up, the community is not just a bunch of old farts shooting the breeze (no pun intended), its a veritable treasure trove. We all have something to share, something to give. Most importantly, keep hacking other peoples stuff, breaking it, and making it better than it was before, untill they keep the changes.</p>
