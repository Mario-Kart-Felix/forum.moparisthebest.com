    <description>What happened to just sources and no clients? Can anyone point me in the direction to a server that you don&#39;t need a client to play. I want to be able to play it through moparscape (so obv no customs)

It may be a nooby question but does this still exist?</description>

<p>I know that most delta based servers are compatible with the MoparScape client, I’m not sure about the rest of frameworks. winterLove will be compatible.</p>
