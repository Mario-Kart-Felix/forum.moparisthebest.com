    <description>Hello Every1 im facing a problem that got me crazy which is the compiler, since i downloaded the client im getting 100 errors ( cannot fnd symbol ), so i redownloaded and got the same thing. so i told my brother to download it on his laptop and it worked just fine without errors ! :O can any1 tell me whats happening ? PLEASE i need help !  :confused:

I have tryed deleting cache 100 errors ( cannot fnd symbol ), delete sign 100 errors ( cannot fnd symbol ) also,  i deleted all files left only one ( Player.java OR any other .java file ) 100 errors ( cannot fnd symbol ). WTF is this ! PLEASE this is getting me mad.
