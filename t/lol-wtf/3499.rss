    <title>Lol wtf?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lol-wtf/3499</link>
    <description>For some reason my internet isn&#39;t working, every site I try I get timed out, apart from this site which takes ages to load for some reason (why can I only get on mopar forums and not other sites?!), also, my network card (in the pc where the internet cable from my router is plugged into is flashing green and orange, before slow, now very fast, also msn says there&#39;s something wrong with &quot;key ports&quot; and that my firewall should be turned off, even though I have no firewalls on, also I&#39;ve tried reseting my modem, my router, my pc, changing slots of the cable in the router, renewing dns, I&#39;ve had this problem before apart from mopar forums weren&#39;t working (that&#39;s what&#39;s wierd, I can&#39;t go on any site but I can go on this one), and it fixed itself after restarting, can someone please help? Thanks.

edit: Also my server is working =\ this is wierd lolz XD</description>
