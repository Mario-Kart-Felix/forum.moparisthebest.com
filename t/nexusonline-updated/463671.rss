    <description>NexusOnline is a new and exciting rsc pk server. Created by pkers for pkers. We understand what it takes to make a successful pk server, however more importantly we know what it takes to keep it around. We aim to bring you a combination of new and old features. This way you can relate to past rsc servers such as DemonClassic, Storkpk, EdgePkz, KingPk, and SwagPk. With innovation we will produce something completely unique and never before seen. It&#39;s an exciting time for us and we hope you would join us when the server is released.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A pk server with quests? Yes! All quests are completely unique and will provide pkers with rewards related to pking. Players are not required to complete quests, but the reward are worth the time. Right now, we have three quests with a new unique story line.
