    <title>Need Someone to run a server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-someone-to-run-a-server/245851</link>
    <description>I have a mac. I can&#39;t find anyplace to help me run my server.  :( so i would like to know if someone would want to.

I just need to know when it will be up and not up.

My Website is pwn.smfforfree3.com

The server should be named pwn, something. I don&#39;t have ip&#39;s, just the source. If anyone is interested, you will be a admin and a admin/Server runner on our site. If someone does, we can talk about it more somewhere else. I will spend lots of time developing the server. I just can&#39;t run it :/ 

Thanks, hope your interested.
