That is his decision and the immaturity in your comment just leads me to believe you have never even been with a girl, so nuff talk bout all that java book titties grabbing, buddy, because logically speaking, women go towards men who will provide them with a comfortable life style, support, and success, not some drop out drug addict who thinks they like him cause he does drugs.</p>

<p>Not rekt at all. I have an incredibly well paid job, a load of friends, a great car, great living conditions. Just because someone enjoys drugs recreationally doesn’t make them a drop out drug addict.

I hope you’re not implying that I’m some form of a drop out druggie, because I’m not lol.<br>
When I say “drugs” I realistically mean a single drug (drug in this case meaning an illegal substance).<br>
I’ve also graduated high school and am working on going to college once I can afford the means to do so.<br>
Don’t assume, okay? It makes an <span class="bbcode-b">ass</span> out of yo<span class="bbcode-b">u</span> and <span class="bbcode-b">me</span> (the bolded letters spell assume).</p>

<p>Well i am very happy for you and your “AMAZING” life choices, how ever that being said, If you are only going to judge other peoples life choices, please keep it off of my post, i nor have the time, place or tolerance level to be dealing with someone who is ignorant enough to call another person “Gay” for loving programming.<br>
That is his decision and the immaturity in your comment just leads me to believe you have never even been with a girl, so nuff talk bout all that java book titties grabbing, buddy, because logically speaking, women go towards men who will provide them with a comfortable life style, support, and success, not some drop out drug addict who thinks they like him cause he does drugs.</p>
