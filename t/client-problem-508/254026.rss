    <description>ok i have my server running i open my client and type in my ip it stays on update server bit and in my server box it says connection recived from my IP but in the client box it now says error_game_js5_connect

Please help!
Thanks :)
P.S the reason i am posting here is because i posted it on mopar client questions but someone said it was in the wrong section and to put it here
UPDATE:i think it is the port that the client connects to how do you change the port in which the client connects to? because my server is on 43594 and i think that the client thinks it may be somthing different like 5555</description>
