    <title>Adding a &#39;High&#39; feature on PI base. Will Rep++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-a-high-feature-on-pi-base-will-rep/379585</link>
    <description>Alright, well i wanna add a feature in my server that gets you high. First, how do i rename the item &#39;GlassBlowing Pipe&#39; into &#39;Blunt&#39;. I changed it in my item.cfg but nothing changed. Next i need to add a feature that when you use a tinderbox on it, a bunch of smoke comes up on your screen, prefferably the smoke from the smoke dungeon in desert treasure quest on real rs. Ill Rep++ whoever sets this up for me, as i am not the greatest PI coder..</description>
