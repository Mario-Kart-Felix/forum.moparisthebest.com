    <title>More admins</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/more-admins/173270</link>
    <description>Hey guys, we have a sufficient number of global moderators/sectional moderators, but personally I believe we need about maybe 1-2 more administrators.

Administrators are HARDLY ever on. It&#39;s been nearly 2 weeks since I&#39;ve seen a admin online.
