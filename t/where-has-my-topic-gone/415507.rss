    <title>Where has my topic gone?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-has-my-topic-gone/415507</link>
    <description>In the team developments board I posted a topic for people to realize there are better solutions out there than DropBox. Everyone there seems to be getting screwed by either having their source leaked or deleted. 

I was providing them with a new way that would solve the deletion of their source. As well as allow them to revert back to any position they felt necessarily for whatever reason. (If they added something that was horrible or just didn&#39;t work out, or knowing them.. caused too many errors to fix).

I then went on to explain to them to not just accept anyone into their team and put them through some tests. Thus making sure they have some credibility and actually will know how to help you with what you want for your server.

I was simply giving out useful information on how to solve 3 different issues that i&#39;d say 80% of this community have. I guess the mods here don&#39;t want to have a better community?</description>

That is a moderator’s discretion whether or not the thread is removed or moved to another board, as well as if the thread deserved to be stickied.</p>

              <p>Your thread was probably removed because it wasn’t a development related topic. It’s talked about whatever your talking about now, not a development of some server, client etc.</p>
