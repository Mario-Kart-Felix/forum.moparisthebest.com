    <title>-Jagex Coming After ME?- I Will Not STAND DOWN~!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagex-coming-after-me-i-will-not-stand-down/409796</link>
    <description>[center][b]So Jagex had emailed me and submitted a &quot;DMCA&quot; ticket to my hostgator support.

UPDATES:

They have now filed dmca&#39;s against me, my vps hoster, my hostgator.
All of the above mentioned i have seen the submitted dmca filed.


DMCA LINK THEY FILED UPON ME:
[url=http://www.elitedemons.org/dmca.php]www.elitedemons.org/dmca.php[/url]

Their now claiming that if i don&#39;t take down THEIR content that they will pursue.

QUICK QUESTION!!!

Why is Jagex, Runescape coming after other websites, and in the mean time here stands Moparscape.org loud and clear providing thousands of downloads, with all their source code available for full editation.
