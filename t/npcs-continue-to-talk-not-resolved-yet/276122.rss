    <title>NPC&#39;s continue to talk. [NOT RESOLVED YET]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npcs-continue-to-talk-not-resolved-yet/276122</link>
    <description>Okay, I figured the easiest way to show you this is by showing you a part of my client.java.
This is on a delta based server by the way.

[code]case 116:
            talk(&quot;Would you like to go to Barrows mate?&quot;, 2024);
            break;
         case 117:
            choice(&quot;Yes.&quot;, &quot;No.&quot;);
            break;
         case 118:
            talk(&quot;&#39;Ello, and what are you after then?&quot;, 1597);
            break;
         case 119:
            talk(&quot;I have a wide selection of Slayer equipment; take a look!&quot;, 1597);
            break;
         case 120:
            talk2(&quot;You&#39;re only assigned to kill&quot;, &quot;&quot;+GetNpcName(taskID)+&quot;; only &quot;+taskAmount+&quot; more to go.&quot;, 1597);
            break;
         case 121:
            talk(&quot;My name&#39;s Vannaka; I&#39;m a Slayer Master.&quot;, 1597);
            break;
         case 122:
            talk2(&quot;You&#39;ll find me in Edgeville. I&#39;ll be here when you need&quot;, &quot;a new task.&quot;, 1597);
            break;
         case 123:
            talk2(&quot;You do not have a task.&quot;, &quot;Talk to me in Edgeville when you get one.&quot;, 1597);
            break;[/code]



So, after talking to Strange old man, it automatically goes to vannaka without letting you select an option.
I created a backup of my files, but it is from quite a long time ago. If I can just find the part of client.java (or other file)
that I need to fix this problem, I&#39;ll be all set. So, my question is this: What part of client.java (or other file) controls this?</description>
