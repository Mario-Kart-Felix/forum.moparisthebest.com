              <p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Gone Fishing</span>[/center]</p>
<p>Saturday morning I got up early, put on my long johns, dressed quietly, made my lunch, grabbed the dog, slipped quietly into the garage to hook the boat to the truck, and proceeded to back out into a torrential downpour.</p>
<p>There was snow mixed with the rain and the wind was blowing 50 mph so I pulled back into the garage, turned on the radio, and discovered that the weather would be bad throughout the day.</p>
<p>I went back into the house, quietly undressed, and slipped back into bed.</p>
<p>There I cuddled up to my wife’s back, now with a different anticipation and whispered, “The weather out there is terrible.”</p>
<p>She sleepily replied, “Can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in that shit?”</p>

              <p>In honor of my own sense of pride I need to post the following:</p>
<p>The Top 10 reasons why a handgun is better than a woman</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#10</span> - You can trade an old .44 for two new .22s.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#9</span> - You can keep one handgun at home and have another for<br>
when you’re on the road.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#8</span> - If you admire a friend’s handgun, and tell him so, he<br>
will probably let you try it out a few times.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#7</span> - Your primary handgun doesn’t mind if you have a<br>
backup.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#6</span> - Your handgun will stay with you even if you’re out of<br>
ammo.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#5</span> - A handgun doesn’t take up a lot of closet space.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#4</span> - Handguns function normally every day of the month.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#3</span> - A handgun doesn’t ask “Do these new grips make me look<br>
fat?”</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#2</span> - A handgun doesn’t mind if you go to sleep after you<br>
use it.</p>
<p>AND THE NUMBER ONE WAY THAT A HANDGUN IS BETTER THAN A<br>
WOMAN . . . You can buy a silencer for a handgun.</p>
<p>To be happy with a man, you must understand him a lot and love him a little.<br>
To be happy with a woman, you must love her a lot and not try to understand her at all.</p>
<p>Why Beer Is Better Than Women</p>
<pre><code>* You can enjoy a beer all month long.
* Beer stains wash out.
* You don't have to wine and dine a beer.
* Your beer will always wait patiently in the car while you play ball.
* If your beer is flat, you can toss it out.
* Beer is never late.
* A beer doesn't get jealous when you grab another beer.
* A hangover will go away.
* Beer labels come off without a fight.
* When you go to a bar, you know you can always pick up a beer.
* A beer never has a headache.
* A beer will never nag you.
* A beer won't get upset if you come home and have another beer.
* If you pour a beer right, you'll always get good head.
* A beer always goes down easy.
* You can share a beer with friends.
* You always know if you're the first one to pop a beer.
* A beer is always wet.
* A beer doesn't demand equality.
* You can have a beer in public.
* A beer doesn't care what time you come home.
* A frigid beer is a good beer.
* You don't have to wash a beer for it to taste good.
* If you decide to change beers, you don't have to pay alimony.
</code></pre>
<p>The Rules</p>
<p>The female always makes the rules.</p>
<p>The rules are subject to change at any time without prior notification.</p>
<p>No male can possibly know all the rules.</p>
<p>If the female suspects the male knows all the rules, she must immediately change some or all the rules.</p>
<p>The female is never wrong.</p>
<p>If the female is wrong, it is because of a flagrant misunderstanding which was a direct result of something the male did or said wrong.</p>
<p>If Rule 6 applies, the male must apologize immediately for causing the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The female can change her mind at any given point in time for any reason.</p>
<p>The male must never change his mind without express written consent from the female.</p>
<p>The female has every right to be angry or upset at any time.</p>
<p>The male must remain calm at all times, unless the female wants him to be angry or upset.</p>
<p>The female must not, under any circumstances, let the male know whether or not she wants him to be angry or upset.</p>
<p>Any attempt by the male to document these rules could result in severe bodily harm.</p>
<p>If the female has PMS, all rules are null and void</p>

"I got a job at Burger King, yeah, my brother got the job there too, mhmm, he’s the Manager, but he thinks he is ‘The Burger King’ you know what I’m talking about? He would put me on drive-through EVERY night. Why do people intend to shout at the drive-through? It’s common technology that I was put my headset on…<br>
“Hello, welcome to Burger King may I take your order?”<br>
-[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><em>Shouts harshly</em></span>[/size]<br>
“Umm, hello? Can you speak a little softer?”<br>
-[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><em>Shouting continues</em></span>[/size]<br>
I mean like, yeah, also there are those who speak too low that would just drive me crazy…<br>
“Hello, may I help you?”<br>
-[size=2pt]Yes, give me a pickles, and a pickles and a pickles![/size]<br>
