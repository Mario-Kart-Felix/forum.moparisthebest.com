        <pre><code>Hi, my name's Robert and I'm pretty new to this whole thing so I'm sorry if I posted this in the wrong spot. My friends and I really miss the old Runescape before Jagex started adding all the silly things and pretty much ruined it in our opinions. We looked into some RSPSs but did not like how every one of them made changes to the game, like modifying game content and the leveling systems, etc. What we really want is just the plain, original Runescape game without any modifications to it.

By saying plain, original game I mean that it would be just like logging into Runescape and just playing the game. From what I have looked into and understand, 508 is what we would like. We want all the updates through the end 2010 before they started ruining it (our opinions). I don't really know if the whole 508 has anything to do with it but yeah. :P

What we were thinking was figuring out some way to make it so that we could each get on our own computers, play freely on our own, and then when we're together, have some way to connect via lan where we would all be in the same game. I think the best comparison to this idea would be Minecrafts lan system. Each player can go in, play on their own worlds, do whatever they want and then when on the same internet connection, can join each others worlds via lan. Each players data is saved on disconnection, so that the next time they connect, they have the same items, are in the same place they left, etc. We would like to apply this system to Runescape. Each player can go in, train skills, complete quests and whatnot on their own, and then get together with their friends and all play together with everyone's account data being saved.

I know this might sound a little complicated or extreme but I don't doubt the possibility of making it work, anything is possible, it's just a matter of figuring out how to make it work. I saw a server thing where the player could log in and play and whatnot without internet connection, so I assume the computer ran the world on it's own without the use of any type of network, but was not capable of multiplayer, the player was alone on the world. If this idea could be tweaked and have a lan capability added to it, our lan Runescape idea might be possible, I really don't know. I haven't seen anything like what we want in all my searching.

Any help at all is appreciated, even a straight up "This idea is stupid and impossible" although I would prefer the opposite :P

<p>Minecraft did it, so why not Runescape? I don’t know, sorry for the long post. Just a wishful dream that may or may not come true. Thanks!</p>

        <p>You’re not going to find:</p>
<blockquote>What we really want is just the plain, original Runescape game without any modifications to it.</blockquote>
Why? Because most (not all) the code in a RSPS is wrote by that RSPS's current owner. While some features of the client (depending on what one you're downloading and so forth) do belong to jagex (the cache on any client, duh?) most of it is written by someone that doesn't work for jagex. Therefore it's mostly based on memory, and what they could scavenge
<p>If you’re looking for a deob (a de-obfuscated) client (there are a couple servers, but mostly cache’s and clients), you can find one here: <a href="http://displee.com/archive/RS2/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://displee.com/archive/RS2/</a><br>
Otherwise you have to download one and modify it yourself.</p>
<p>Also, what you’re talking about isn’t hard whatsoever. Each RSPS client connects to a server based on the IP defined in the client (Note: some server’s require you to add the IP in it, but not all). It’s very easy to modify which IP you want it to connect to, and lucky for you, all computers have a possibility to play some form of LAN.</p>
<p>If you’re playing alone, and you’re just adding your own content, etc etc. You want to change the ip address to “127.0.0.1” or even the word “localhost”.</p>
<p>If you want to play LAN, (as you described) first make sure all computers are connected to the same network.<br>
Make one computer the host computer.<br>
Get the host computers LAN IP (it’s usually 192.168.XXX.XXX, or similar. It can be found in the network and sharing center on windows).<br>
Put that IP in each of the clients that are on the computers that ARE NOT the host computer.<br>
Login. You’re now playing localhost <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You seem a bit misinformed. You’re going to have to learn java to program a RSPS. I’ve a seen  a “blank” 317 server and client download around 30mb, so there is no reason to download “1000-MB files to do this”. Most of the files you are downloading is the cache.<br>
You don’t know what the cache does? It stores all the sprites, models, maps. etc for the client to use. You kinda-sorta <span class="bbcode-b">need</span> one.</p>
<p>Also, you’re account was just registered today. More specifically seconds after this question was posted. While the rule for multiple accounts isn’t as enforced because of the new advertisements board, what you’re doing (Assuming you are the same person as the OP) is still frowned upon.</p>
