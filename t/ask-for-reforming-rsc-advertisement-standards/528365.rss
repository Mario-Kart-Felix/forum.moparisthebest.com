[size=14pt]A great man once said...[/size]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Free software is software that respects your freedom and the social solidarity of your community. So it&#39;s free as in freedom.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[i]Are you tired of server owners trying to take advantage of you without your knowledge?[/i]

[i]Are you sick of other &quot;developers&quot; stealing code claiming it&#39;s their own?[/i]

[i]Are you frustrated by digital handcuffs?[/i]

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I would say the free software movement has gone about half the distance it has to travel. We managed to make a mass community but we still have a long way to go to liberate computer users. Those companies are very powerful. They are cleverly finding new ways to take control over users. ... The most widely used non-free programs have malicious features – and I’m talking about specific, known malicious features. ... There are three kinds: those that spy on the user, those that restrict the user, and back doors. Windows has all three. Microsoft can install software changes without asking permission. Flash Player has malicious features, as do most mobile phones. Digital handcuffs are the most common malicious features. They restrict what you can do with the data in your own computer. Apple certainly has the digital handcuffs that are the tightest in history. The i-things, well, people found two spy features and Apple says it removed them and there might be more. When people don’t know about this issue they choose based on immediate convenience and nothing else. And therefore they can be herded into giving up their freedom by a combination of convenient features, pressure from institutions and the network effect.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps we ask ourselves, who are we holding accountable? 

In light in what has happened regarding NSA violating privacy and general concerns behind the intent of proprietary software, I propose we set new standards to properly regulate private servers. 

No more questionable use of software distribution. Stop server owners from violating [b]YOUR[/b] freedoms and privacy. Ask for source code before downloading!

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the free/libre software movement, we develop software that respects users&#39; freedom, so we and you can escape from software that doesn&#39;t.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Are you ready for change? Here are some proposed standards that ALL server administrators should follow in order to advertise to your fellow moparscapers:

-All software made available to distribute shall be released under the [url=http://gnu.org/]GNU[/url] GPL (General Public License).

-There should be public repositories made for each piece of software the end user is required to download in order to use. Absolutely no 3rd party links. 

Ex: If one makes a server called FreeScape, the [b]owner[/b] shall be responsible for creating a public repository (Github, bitbucket, etc) including licensing made known to the user on the topic, it MUST stay up to date with said updates any developers make throughout the lifetime of it&#39;s distribution.

-Any and all changes made to the software shall be known ON THE ADVERTISEMENT TOPIC for any user to review, including the repository. 

If any server owners refuse to comply, you SHOULD have the right to refuse further use of their services and ask for removal from advertisements for no compliance on said standards.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Value your freedom or you will lose it, teaches history. &#39;Don&#39;t bother us with politics&#39;, respond those who don&#39;t want to learn.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b]It&#39;s time for change. Don&#39;t let big name servers run this section without calling them out on their antics![/b]

[size=24pt]Free software is the answer. Spread awareness of free software to your friends and colleagues. Read more about Richard Stallman by visiting [url=http://stallman.org/]stallman.org[/url][/size]

<p>It seems you have broken multiple rules relating to the RSC Server Development / Discussion section. You can find a list of rules <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,234212.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>May you familiarize yourself with the rules, specifically rule <span class="hashtag">#1</span>, rule <span class="hashtag">#2</span>, rule <span class="hashtag">#3</span>, rule <span class="hashtag">#4</span>, rule <span class="hashtag">#5</span>, rule # 6, rule # 7, and lastly, rule <span class="hashtag">#8</span>. If you fail to reconstruct your initial post to follow the guidelines of this board I will be forced to seek administrative action against your thread and quite possibly your account.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you’re text abilities are inferior and you should seek immediate medical and psycological advice from ‘The Enforcer’ or a guy named ‘Pork’. If you fail to seek these gurus I also provided a link below to help you in your quest.</p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>You’ve misinterpreted my intentions completely, on the assumption that I would have anything to gain from it. This is about the communities freedoms, not free code to leach off of, therefore I will have to dismiss this argument. Yes, free software is about choice <span class="bbcode-b">HOWEVER</span> when users are knowingly being taken advantage of through shady practices (such as this community) there is reason for concern, and real needs for change. Many aren’t even aware, and this community does a poor job informing them of such decisions, I’ve made it my mission to inform as many people as possible. You have proven to me you are in favor of digital handcuffs and not an agent of freedom.</p>
<blockquote>If in my lifetime the problem of non-free software is solved, I could perhaps relax and write software again. But I might instead try to help deal with the world's larger problems. Standing up to an evil system is exhilarating, and now I have a taste for it.</blockquote>
