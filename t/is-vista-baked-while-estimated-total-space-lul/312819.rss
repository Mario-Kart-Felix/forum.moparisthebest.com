    <title>Is vista baked while estimated Total Space lul?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-vista-baked-while-estimated-total-space-lul/312819</link>
    <description>okay, well i had this refurbished Hp Laptop with Vista home premium and it&#39;s been getting quite slow, so i decided to clean up, before i clean up i usually check my disk space, because i get curious to see how muchactually get&#39;s removed. so it said i had 42gb out of 70gb on my disk, i cleaned out WoW and some other shit added up to about 20gb of space removed. this was about 2 months ago btw. After that i organized all my files so it&#39;s more organized etc, and didn&#39;t change my defualt save location for downloads, so i know how much i actually download.

This week i checked my disk space and it said i have 49 gb of space left, and i&#39;ve only downloaded 100mb of files so far. I only did two iTune updates, 1 mcafee update and like 1 vista update. nothing more than a total of 250+ mb of space downloaded since i cleaned my computer.

So, where&#39;s all my space being eaten up at? :s

Atm, i have no clue what the problem is but i&#39;ve also noticed every day, i check the disk space, it&#39;s always different, if i go on itunes for 10 minutes check disk space shut it off for the day, nothing more then the next day, it&#39;ll say there is about 5 more gb of space left than it was the day b4, without downloading shit all. then the day after that it&#39;d say i have 34 gb of space left, and so on, it&#39;s completly different each day and it&#39;s kind of worrying me, seeming i just got this laptop last christmas, i don&#39;t want to hear theres hardware problem or perhaps it&#39;s just the fact it isn&#39;t reading accurate results. i could show pictures of a timeline from now to a week later, just i don&#39;t think it&#39;s needed.


Problem 2:

I&#39;ve noticed while using hypercam, my computer gets a black screen and freezes up at random. this usually happens when i try to film something on rs for example, but i decided, i&#39;d try and put it on lowest possible detail and even fix my performance so it&#39;d run smoother and prevent crashes, but it crashes about, 10 minutes of filming, and happens very often.
Anything i can do, possibly a different recording program perhaps?

Problem 3:

Should i get a cooling dock for my laptop?
Recently, after i cleaned my laptop out, my laptop seems to, erm, i THINK overheat and shut off. I assumed it was from running it too much, but i doubt 5 hours of running itunes+msn would overheat it, and sometimes it&#39;d crash within an hour. like instantly shut off, no warning, no sounds, and the only solution that worked so far is waiting a half hour or, taking the battery our, unplug everything, hold the power button for 10 seconds, putting the battery back in plug it in, and it&#39;d start up, and the fan would blow extremly loud for 30 seconds or so.

Just i&#39;m kinda confused why the fan never get&#39;s loud before it shuts off, and i even tried putting my laptop so the backend of it, where the fans are, is off my desk so it blows the air down, under the desk for better filtration, but it hasn&#39;t helped.

Overall:
I&#39;m quite worried about this laptop whether these are small problems, seeming this is new (too me), and i can&#39;t afford to have my laptop have a hardware failure/overheating problems, such as anything being melted inside etc.

Any tips on any problems would be GREATLY appreciated,
Thank you in advance.


Note: Coincidence much lol?

<p>Trust me, 10 minutes of 70-80% cpu usage is more than enough to overheat if the cooling is bad.<br>
Unfortunatly since this is a laptop, it is quite hard to replace the fan so as I said before, buy a cooling dock and you should be able to solve 2 problems.</p>

<p>and i doubt hypercam would overheat, because It would crash within 10 minutes after the computer is turned on but yes i understand it probably takes up a shit load of cpu, i think, running itunes, msn and swiftkit Low detail standerd screen puts me from 70-80 cpu usage.</p>
<p>uhm, it’s refurbbed b.c i got it as a gift, and it was only 199$ lul so i think saving $200 made them buy it refurbed.</p>

<p>Most likely to be spyware. As shit as Vista is, it defiantly does not rob disk space like that.</p>

<p>This is caused by overheating refer to 3.</p>

<p>The operating system has nothing to do with system temperature. I have to admit less CPU usage would improve things and xp/7 would provide that for you however the point is that your laptop is getting way too hot. Clean, Clean, Clean is what you need to do. tbh, you should never have purchased a refurb laptop because they are normally bound to a string of hardware failuires. It looks like the person that put your laptop together used a cheap fan, poor heat sensors- basically poor heat management.<br>
Buy a cooling dock and when using your laptop put it on a flat surface. DONT put it on a bed or your lap or it will simply overheat.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Can you provide some system specs: (cpu and hd is most important)</p>
<p>ps, the ad coincidence is just google adsense which looks for key words on a page and matches them with adverts signed up with them</p>

Vista’s a crappy operating system. I’d recommend getting Windows 7, but XP is just as good.<br>

          <blockquote>
              <p>okay, well i had this refurbished Hp Laptop with Vista home premium and it’s been getting quite slow, so i decided to clean up, before i clean up i usually check my disk space, because i get curious to see how muchactually get’s removed. so it said i had 42gb out of 70gb on my disk, i cleaned out WoW and some other shit added up to about 20gb of space removed. this was about 2 months ago btw. After that i organized all my files so it’s more organized etc, and didn’t change my defualt save location for downloads, so i know how much i actually download.</p>
<p>This week i checked my disk space and it said i have 49 gb of space left, and i’ve only downloaded 100mb of files so far. I only did two iTune updates, 1 mcafee update and like 1 vista update. nothing more than a total of 250+ mb of space downloaded since i cleaned my computer.</p>
<p>So, where’s all my space being eaten up at? :s</p>
<p>Atm, i have no clue what the problem is but i’ve also noticed every day, i check the disk space, it’s always different, if i go on itunes for 10 minutes check disk space shut it off for the day, nothing more then the next day, it’ll say there is about 5 more gb of space left than it was the day b4, without downloading shit all. then the day after that it’d say i have 34 gb of space left, and so on, it’s completly different each day and it’s kind of worrying me, seeming i just got this laptop last christmas, i don’t want to hear theres hardware problem or perhaps it’s just the fact it isn’t reading accurate results. i could show pictures of a timeline from now to a week later, just i don’t think it’s needed.</p>
<p>Problem 2:</p>
<p>I’ve noticed while using hypercam, my computer gets a black screen and freezes up at random. this usually happens when i try to film something on rs for example, but i decided, i’d try and put it on lowest possible detail and even fix my performance so it’d run smoother and prevent crashes, but it crashes about, 10 minutes of filming, and happens very often.<br>
Anything i can do, possibly a different recording program perhaps?</p>
<p>Problem 3:</p>
<p>Should i get a cooling dock for my laptop?<br>
Recently, after i cleaned my laptop out, my laptop seems to, erm, i THINK overheat and shut off. I assumed it was from running it too much, but i doubt 5 hours of running itunes+msn would overheat it, and sometimes it’d crash within an hour. like instantly shut off, no warning, no sounds, and the only solution that worked so far is waiting a half hour or, taking the battery our, unplug everything, hold the power button for 10 seconds, putting the battery back in plug it in, and it’d start up, and the fan would blow extremly loud for 30 seconds or so.</p>
<p>Just i’m kinda confused why the fan never get’s loud before it shuts off, and i even tried putting my laptop so the backend of it, where the fans are, is off my desk so it blows the air down, under the desk for better filtration, but it hasn’t helped.</p>
<p>Overall:<br>
I’m quite worried about this laptop whether these are small problems, seeming this is new (too me), and i can’t afford to have my laptop have a hardware failure/overheating problems, such as anything being melted inside etc.</p>
<p>Any tips on any problems would be GREATLY appreciated,<br>
Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Note: Coincidence much lol?</p>
