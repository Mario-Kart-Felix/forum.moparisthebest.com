    <description>Hello, I&#39;ve just recently started a new server.. Well tried.

I did everything right..Or so I think, After many days of trying to get my compiler to work, I finally got it, But I still can&#39;t log in.. It just takes a really long time then says Error connecting to server..

Can someone tell me what I did wrong..

My port forward thing is

RSPS, 43594-43594 both 192.168.1.2 enabled.

It would be soooo nice if someone could help me with this problem.</description>
