    <title>Get the runescape download here! construction added! soz 4 wrong section</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/get-the-runescape-download-here-construction-added-soz-4-wrong-section/5537</link>
    <description>as the wrong title says,
there aint a latest runescape version
for all those beginners don&#39;t ask and spam this forum 
just to ask for a so said &quot;runescape 2006 &quot;
if you don&#39;t like private servers the way it is now
then stop editing and play normal rs
if you do like private servers
continue editing, BUT DONT SPAM THIS FORUM FOR CRIES SAKE
also, the latest forums have more sections, these:
- server development/help
- server development tuts
- server downloads
(now i&#39;m only talking about rs2 server development, not rsc)

-for all those ppl who want to ask something
put that in [size=15pt]server development/help[/size]

-for all those ppl who want to development something (with toturials)
put that in [size=15pt]server development tuts[/size]

-for all those ppl who want to put there server/client for public download
put that in [size=15pt]server downloads[/size]

do not ask something in server downloads if it needs to be in server development/help !

this is all i have to say, i think some ppl think &quot; wtf, so stupid&quot; and continue spamming
but i also think some ppl would see this is better.
i also suggest if something is putten in the wrong section, to not answering it.


my second point.
ppl who are new, read the rules, don&#39;t be lazy
and if you are to lazy to read it
then i say two rules that have been broken a few times:
1. buying aint allowed on the forums
2. selling aint allowed on the forums

i hope this post would give these boards less spam messages.
i greed yall.</description>
