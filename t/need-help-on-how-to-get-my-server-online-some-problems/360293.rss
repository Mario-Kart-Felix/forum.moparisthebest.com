          <blockquote>
              <p>go to your site adress area and do <a href="http://127.0.0.1" rel="nofollow noopener">http://127.0.0.1</a>:(your ip entrance in case should be 895 if not 43594 or 5555) or another IP which you have and check if the port is 43594.<br>
There are tutorials to Portforwarding correctly, the easyest one is with Utorrent ( i did this one in 1 minute ).If you are using Utorrent you have to first Run your server then Run Utorrent and let it on all the time!<br>
Do you have no-ip? If yes, be sure the IP you gave them is correct with all the letters, if not, be sure all the numbers are correct.<br>
If you using hamachi be sure they have the right IP too.</p>
<p>I can only help this way, if it still DOESN<code>T work with Utorrent which is the best one then i don</code>t know, sorry.</p>
