Well, I don’t want to be as much of a bitch as you are, but can you stop being a cunt for one damn moment in your life?</p>
<p>All you do is stroll around these forums posting without reading and being an asshole to everyone.<br>
Lose the fucking attitude, stop thinking your “the shit”, be a little nicer, and you might actually make a friend or two.</p>
<p>Stop worrying about the God damn post count and post helpful information, not useless shit like calling people names.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you will be hated among these forums.<br>
[/quote]Only 2 or 3 people hate me on here, and that’s because they flamed <span class="bbcode-b">me</span>.<br>
And I post useless shit, god damn right I do! Because posting anything helpful on this forum is like asking to get anything, and everything, you do leeched and stolen.<br>
I also rather like my attitude, and I don’t really care about my post count, last time I checked I had like 800?<br>
And I know I’m “the shit”, thanks for noticing.</p>
<p>[quote author=wohuynia link=topic=437475.msg3216208#msg3216208 date=1274689416]<br>
Natey you just simply hate me and start to pick on me every post i reply??<br>
If so then that’s childish and your not going to prove anything, you just got in the fight not only with me but now with more people and that’s not going well, i suggest you go take a chill pill and get out of that basement that you call your house and get some fresh air, it help you know.<br>
[/quote]I am chill, idiot.<br>
I’m childish? Too damned bad I’m 16 retard.<br>
Also, try fixing some of your grammar, since you know everything about Java and I know nothing, yet you can’t even spell “you’re” right.<br>
I also do go outside, I do that rather a lot, I got hang out with mates and we smoke and do stupid shit, don’t see how you know me anyway in real life, I suggest you learn a bit about me before saying I sit in my “basement” when all I have is a 1ft crawl space.[/quote]<br>
You pick on one quad, it’s not a mistake, saying “I’m the shit” sounded funny, I am chill sounded even funnier.<br>
Well you’re stuck on 10 and still a child to me, cause I’m 19, based on your attitude and looking how you behave.</p>
<p>Am i asking anything for the things i help?? No.<br>
I’m doing this cause i like helping and that improves my knowledge in java.<br>
I didn’t saw anything, completely anything that would show that you know java, or anything like it.</p>
