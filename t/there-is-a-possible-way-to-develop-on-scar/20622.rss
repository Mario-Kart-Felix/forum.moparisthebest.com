    <description>There is a possible way to develop on scar.

Is anyone willing to ask Kaitnieks for the source code or at least decompiling it?

It&#39;s been almost 6 or 7 months, it would be nice if we knew that &#39;someone&#39; was working on SCAR. And it is possible, we just need to decompile it and read through the source code and try to understand it. Anyone willing to do either decompile or ask for the source?

No I have no idea what ruler wants to sell here, because I'm not talking directly about whatever you're currently working on. Please reread my revised statement =p

Because we all stopped working on it for some reason at that point, regex picked it up and sold a few on the side but no-one else really had anything to do with that.

Not necessarily, it all depends on the open source license you use (if any).

<p>I have found out people that were part of the aryan dev team, pre-developing aryan would crack other peoples bots.  I am sure cracking and ripping influences current contributors to stop and disuades would-be/future contributors from contributing.  This ripping/cracking has a even more detrimental effect on the people who purchase a product.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ok, well lets talk about who’s in the wrong here, eh ? People were attempting to sell/profit from works based off blatant copyright infringements. Not that I’m saying two wrongs make a right, but I can definately justify said ‘cracking’ in these situations. I am sure making a profit off desperate kiddies and isolating/abusing others is way more detrimental than someone’s loss of a few fraudelent payments. If some people can have a bot, why can’t everyone ? If you’re making bots to support yourself in any way, well you’re probably in the wrong line of work buddy. My greatest gripe has been with people hoarding/hiding what they do purely for self benefit.</p>
<p>I doubt there was anything that was open to be pushed closed, either.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, well while some of the scar scripts could be considered as open source, they are still just an addon to a closed source program. And in my opinion, scar went straight down the tube once Kait implemented this signing of scripts so people can’t see the source and sell the scripts. Don’t get me wrong though, it’s still a great program and I even use it from time to time (great for cheating at those online flash games ;-)). Also, don’t get me wrong, I’m not some sort of, “open source holy roller, YOU MUST GIEV SOURCE OK,” but I do have something against what I mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>As far as the ripping goes, who cares if people ‘rip’ your works ? If what you’ve made has been ripped, it just goes to show that you’ve made something at least half decent and a few other people have gotten use out of it too. I think the old saying goes something like this, “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.” Sure, it might be nice to get recognition, but if that’s what you worry about when you release something, but I’m pretty sure it’d be next to worthless coming from someone who would rip it.</p>

Ok, well lets talk about who's in the wrong here, eh ? People were attempting to sell/profit from works based off blatant copyright infringements. Not that I'm saying two wrongs make a right, but I can definately justify said 'cracking' in these situations. I am sure making a profit off desperate kiddies and isolating/abusing others is way more detrimental than someone's loss of a few fraudelent payments. If some people can have a bot, why can't everyone ? If you're making bots to support yourself in any way, well you're probably in the wrong line of work buddy. My greatest gripe has been with people hoarding/hiding what they do purely for self benefit.
<p>I doubt there was anything that was open to be pushed closed, either.</p>
<blockquote>Also i see scar includes as a open source but you said "worth using".</blockquote>
Yes, well while some of the scar scripts could be considered as open source, they are still just an addon to a closed source program. And in my opinion, scar went straight down the tube once Kait implemented this signing of scripts so people can't see the source and sell the scripts. Don't get me wrong though, it's still a great program and I even use it from time to time (great for cheating at those online flash games ;-)). Also, don't get me wrong, I'm not some sort of, "open source holy roller, YOU MUST GIEV SOURCE OK," but I do have something against what I mentioned in the previous paragraph.
<p>As far as the ripping goes, who cares if people ‘rip’ your works ? If what you’ve made has been ripped, it just goes to show that you’ve made something at least half decent and a few other people have gotten use out of it too. I think the old saying goes something like this, “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.” Sure, it might be nice to get recognition, but if that’s what you worry about when you release something, but I’m pretty sure it’d be next to worthless coming from someone who would rip it.</p>

It was in their intrest not to leak it, it was more of a investment.  Leaking it would only hurt their business. however i didn’t know a g-mod (not pwnd) from this site would cross-me.</p>

<p>I have released many thing open source, i think many of us have and have seen the effects.  Mopar you not open-source however you are pro-leech so long as the leechers are benfiting you.  Even the Aryan devs stopped being open source, they moved and went completely dark although at one point selling their creations but only for a brief time.</p>

not to flame or anything. Before aryan, members on your team would crack other peoples work.  Cracking and rippping push things closed source.  Also i see scar includes as a open source but you said “worth using”.[/quote]</p>

<p>to ruler: Open source would 100% stop cracking and ripping, so what are you talking about?</p>
