<p>So basically, whoever got started on rsps first, all it was was basically runescape maps? And walking, running, everything else was added in?[/quote]Yes. It’s referred to as “flight over runescape”. You would be able to go over the runescape map and watch random items pop up. That was winterLove. It was made just to show that it was possible to emulate. Following that, development furthered to learn more about cheating in runescape. Following <span class="bbcode-i">that</span>, development furthered because people saw opportunity in making a private server.</p>
