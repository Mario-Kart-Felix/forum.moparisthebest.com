    <description>Ok, i have searched the tuts section a million times and not found this stuff, if its there can sum1 post a link? if not then can sum1 post how to.

1. I need the Character apearance thing, to come on once when first loggin or sumthin, there was a tut but i did it, no errors but it didnt work.

2. I need a working ban code, i have the pls command of the testscape source but it doesnt work, and adding their name or ip to the files doesnt work.

3. An auto save that saves once every 5 minutes or sumthin

4. posiby a bat program that detects when the server is messed up and auto restarts the runserver file, or restarts it once every half hour, i think antilag.java is suposed to do this but it doesnt.

5. when u click the accept button on the char screen, it doesnt save and the tut was removed due to leechers or sumthin. so maybe sum1 can post it here or repost the tut?

6. i didnt look for this yet but if there is no tut already, how do i add objects? like were i add the code for em and were i get the object list, 

this is alot i know but its all the stuff ive been needing since i started working with rs servers, witch was around the time moparisthebest.com shut down Ne help is greatly apriciated, ty and sorry for my horrible typing, my auto spell and grammer check broke  :([br][size=1]Posted on: January 05, 2007, 01:23:50 AM[/size][hr]Oh i just realized, Someone please tell me how to make npcs walk!!
I added in the coords right and all, and they dont walk, ive tried a million times and they never seem to walk the only way ive gotten one to walk is by coping a monster near its coords</description>
