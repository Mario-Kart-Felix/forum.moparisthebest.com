    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wtf-is-up-with-my-cd-burner/33955</link>
    <description>Ok, so I&#39;ve just gotten some songs I want to put on a disc, and So I paste them to h:\ then try to make a cd, only it says, please insert a blank cd! I&#39;ve tried atleast the whole dam pack of cds, and when I put them in their nothing shows up on the disc. I know these cd&#39;s can burn because I just burned a couple of programs\music to them. So why the hell is it saying the cd&#39;s aren&#39;t blank. (The CD&#39;s are brand new, blank) I think its the cold but I&#39;m not sure, If anyone knows and can help thanks.</description>

              <p>are they CD-R or CD-RW, cause usually, when you have drive letter access (directCD, Nero InCD, etc.) that’s only for CD-RW.</p>
