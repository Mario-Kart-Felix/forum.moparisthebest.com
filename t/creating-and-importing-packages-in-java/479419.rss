    <title>Creating and Importing packages in Java</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-and-importing-packages-in-java/479419</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m trying to create a little program. No need to really display all of the details. But I have a few different folders with classes that I need for the main class.

This is my Class1.java directory(The main class)
[code]C:\Desktop\Java\Minigame\src\files\game\[/code]

This is the starting classes I need imported
[code]C:\Desktop\Java\Minigame\src\files\game\classes\[/code]

\classes\ contains two java files.
Player.java and Stream.java

I don&#39;t know how many times I have tried different package names for this to just backfire once Class1.java tries to compile. In short, both Player.java and Stream.java have
[code]package files.game.classes;[/code]
at the top of the source files. And both games import one another using
[code]import files.game.classes.Player;
import files.game.classes.Stream;[/code]

There is no problem with those two files importing and using one another(even though they reside in the same directory).

But when Class1.java, which resides one directory behind them in \files\games\ tries to import files.game.classes, the error I receive is that the package does not exist. 

Things I&#39;ve tested.
Changing the package name. Dozens of times. From desktop.java...classes to just classes. Nothing works.

So could you please help me get this imported properly into class1? You should also know that I didn&#39;t name the classes and file names like a derp. Everything should be following proper naming conventions. Files names match capitalization and everything.

All help is thanked in advance. I&#39;d appreciate it.

EDIT
I highly doubt this, but could it be because the packages are made deeper into the directory? I do mess around with RSPS coding and have tried looking into a few different server sources for some type of light. But they all work fine.

A palidino sources has the same layout as mine.(src, cmd, bin). And the Engine.java files imports palidino76.rs2.players and the players package is deeper into the directory(\players).

I really don&#39;t understand the problem here. At all.</description>

<p>I want to learn Java first. Not become dependent on an IDE. Before I used Visual Studio, I wrote everything in a text file and used the C# compiler to program. Once I was comfortable doing all of the basics and use the basic libraries, I started using visual studio. It’s the most effective way for me to learn.</p>

<p>I tried it. Using the semicolon without spacing the two file paths resulted in a file not found error. And spacing the two after the semicolon resulted in an invalid flag for javac. Feel pretty pathetic that I can’t figure this one out. I’ve been programming for years(not in java), and this one little thing has got me in a bind.</p>
