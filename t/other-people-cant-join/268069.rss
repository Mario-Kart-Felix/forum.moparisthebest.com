If you break a rule or law what is it? ILLEGAL</p>
<p>This is the 5th time by the way where you have slipped up with your words. You cant argue with me. In my eyes your just falling deeper and deeper into a whole you can not climb out of.[/quote]No, legal is LAW, rules are just breaking rules. If you break a rule of say, talking out in class at school, that isn’t breaking the law, that’s just breaking a rule. Also, it’s a hole, not a whole. Here’s a bit of advice: stop while you’re ahead, you can’t win against me.</p>
