&lt;blockquote&gt;History

The Internets, a magical cloud of information that floats over your head in the clouds, was invented at least 100 years ago by Al Gore and pluralized by George W. Bush. Some time around 1981 or 2007 (if you&#39;re a FAG!!!1!), some guy in his basement found that he could use his Atari 2600 with his 300 baud modem to get free pr0n and warez. 5 years later, AOL streamlined this process and the Internets as we know them now were born. Only these days, there is way more free pr0n and more warez. It is rumored there may be small pockets of useful information hidden deep in the bowels of the Internets. This has been proven to be false.

The Internets is also unique to history in one way. Any person who uses the Internets has no idea what they&#39;re doing on it. Whereas most people who use a car know the basics of driving, no one on the Internets has a damn clue how to use the Internets. While the functional value of the Internet may be debated, the comedic value is off the charts. It has also been scientifically proven that the more you use the Internets, the less you will get sex.

Last Thursday, whilst digging a hole in his basement, at least 100 year old billy goat and Chairman of teh Senate Internets Pwning Committee, Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) discovered that the Internets is not a big truck after all but actually just a bunch of tangled up tubes [1] and that said tubes are all clogged up with the pubic hairs from all the Internets pr0n. This, of course, explained why his Internets were taking so long to get to him. [2]

He then announced that he was the new Inventor of teh Internets and Plumber in Chief. Then he made a hawt disco record about it. [3]
[edit]
How It Works

Nobody knows how the internets work, except the Jews, nor do they care, and no one seems to care about the Jews. Extensive research by Alan Turing shows that they can have intelligence and be indistinguishable from people but it has since been deciphered that they communicate in very different ways.

Computers talk like this:

    ONE ZERO ZERO ONE ZERO ZERO ONE ONE ONE ZERO! 

People talk like this

    &quot;LOLLERCOASTER!!!! ^_________________^ ASL&quot; 

Neither one makes any sense but sometimes the computers replace the ONE ZERO stuff with BEEPS and BOOPS like on non-cable modems (the phone kind, aka dial-up). Because that travels over speech wires. Cable Modems are faster because they travel over TV. The scrolling stuff at the bottom of CNN Headline News is fast like a cable modem.
