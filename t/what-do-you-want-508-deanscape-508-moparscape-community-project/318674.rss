    <title>What do you want? [508] DeanScape [508] Moparscape community Project</title>

    <description>Hey my name is Ryan Dean, I have been working on Moparscape for a while but just recently signed up for the forums. I want to create a Runescape Private just like pretty much every one else on moparscape but I am doing mine completely different. I have noticed there are a lot of critics on here and everyone has something to say negative about something so what I want to know is [b][size=10pt][color=blue]WHAT DO YOU WANT?[/color][/size][/b] In saying that I want to know what you see in a runescape private server that makes you say &quot;whoa 10/10&quot; or &quot;perfect, dling now&quot;.

Everything in this game will be completely leech-able and you can use it in your game without giving me any credit at all. Mainly because I could care less and you will feel no accomplishment at all if you do and the community will know if you leech so if you can take that its all yours. :D

So what I want is Ideas, Ideas, and more Ideas. and feedback on what you think of this and more ideas.

My server and client will be in 508 I will do as much as I can on my own but if I use anyone else&#39;s work I will get their permission first and credit them.

Check back often for my progress and the idea list.  :eek:[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 09, 2009, 09:11:31 pm[/size]

[size=10pt][size=10pt]Idea List:[/size][/size]
Idea - Difficulty - Progress
All skills - 2/10 - 70%
Pking - 5/10 - 50%
Stability - 7/10 - 35%
Even Economy</description>

then after Stability you should do all skills 100% or at least 80% and after that you can do pking\minigames\economy\and anything else…</p>

              <p>I like this, And with the Economy Stability make the items Hard to obtain, but easy to buy. Like runescape Was before they ruined themselfes. Rune Armor, Was hard to get seeing you had to have somebody have 99 Smithing. But it was easy to sell, merchant and get your hands on it. Pking would be nice, Runescape was also good for pking till they once again ruined themselves. Make it like rs pking, but dont have it to where players are wearing, and get Vesta from a player drop, have the players drop their items, And if you want to make alright skilling Davidscape is always a good thing to use or look off of. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> just thing’s to keep in mind.</p>

I have noticed there are a lot of critics on here and everyone has something to say negative about something so what I want to know is <span class="bbcode-b">[size=10pt][color=blue]WHAT DO YOU WANT?[/color][/size]</span> In saying that I want to know what you see in a runescape private server that makes you say “whoa 10/10” or “perfect, dling now”.</p>
<p>Everything in this game will be completely leech-able and you can use it in your game without giving me any credit at all. Mainly because I could care less and you will feel no accomplishment at all if you do and the community will know if you leech so if you can take that its all yours. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>So what I want is Ideas, Ideas, and more Ideas. and feedback on what you think of this and more ideas.</p>
<p>My server and client will be in 508 I will do as much as I can on my own but if I use anyone else’s work I will get their permission first and credit them.</p>
<p>Check back often for my progress and the idea list.  :eek:[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 09, 2009, 09:11:31 pm[/size]</p>
