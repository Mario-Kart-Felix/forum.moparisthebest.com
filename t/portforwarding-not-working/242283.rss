    <title>Portforwarding NOT WORKING!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-not-working/242283</link>
    <description>This is really starting to frustrate me. I&#39;ve port forwarded port 43594 with my 2WIRE 2701HG-B router, and that didn&#39;t work so I also opened 43594 on Windows Firewall and it&#39;s still not working.

I can connect through 127.0.0.1, but not my NO-IP

Help please?</description>
