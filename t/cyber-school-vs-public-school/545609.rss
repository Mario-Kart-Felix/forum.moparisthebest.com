    <title>Cyber School vs. Public School</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cyber-school-vs-public-school/545609</link>
    <description>So I moved recently, and I live in a bad neighborhood. I don&#39;t want to go to the public school in this area due to the poor education standards which they have. I was curious about Cyberschool, if anyone has any information on it.. Maybe they could help me with these questions...

1) Does Cyber School effect my chances of getting into a college?
2) Would I still be able to do sports if I did Cyberschool?
3) Do I have to go to the school if I take state tests?</description>

<p>Not anti-social. Don’t have to prove anything though. But honestly, I just don’t trust the school. I am still doing football though.</p>

<li>Pretty much what Atomic said. However it depends how your district handles it. For example, I was just in an online school section of the district I was already enrolled in, so they just gave me the same highschool name on my diploma that I would have gotten if I was actually on-campus, and I could have walked at the graduation, etc.</li>
<li>Again, depends on how your district handles it. I was in the same district and still enrolled in the on-campus highschool, just taking online classes. I could have signed up for any clubs/activities that the campus offered. Important to note however is that if you’re not taking classes at the school so nobody on the teams recognize you, it might be hard for them to accept you.</li>
<li>Well, SAT and ACT are not state tests first of all, but again it depends on your state and district. They might have you go to a proctor for any important class tests (midterms/finals), or just for state tests (in my state that’s the WASL/HSPE). For SAT/ACT you will definitely have to go to a proctor as well, your district/state wouldn’t even have a say in it.[/quote]<br>
Ah, right. Well I still had to meet with a proctor somewhere locally for any non-course specific test</li>

              <p>I’d have to say David summed it up pretty well. Your best bet is to contact someone in your school district and ask about policies regarding course and state testing when taking online courses. The only way I think you can enroll in sports is if you are enrolled in the school, presumably for at least 1 course. If that is the case then see if it is possible to enroll for an elective each year. However, this means you either have to take the bus to school and then walk home, or you have to get a ride home/drive if you’re of legal age. I had a friend in her junior year who was taking college courses at the local community college and she was only at school for the last 2 periods because she was getting credits from online and college.</p>
<p>Like David said, a lot of your questions are going to have answers that depend on what your district allows. I would suggest sitting your guardian down and discussing what you want to do, and then find out what your options are with them.</p>
