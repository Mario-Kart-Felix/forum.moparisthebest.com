    <title>Predictions I found</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/predictions-i-found/317749</link>
    <description>[center]Vanga was a woman of exceptional abilities. Succeeded to predict the Second World War and its outcome, date of death of Tsar Boris III, the advent of Communism in power, the division of Czechoslovakia into two countries, rioting in Lebanon of 1968, the war in Nicaragua in 1979, electoral victory of Indira Gandhi in 1979 and her recent death, perestroika and the collapse of the USSR, the sinking of the submarine &quot;Kursk&quot; attacks of 11 September ... There are quite prophecies that have not materialized ... And because Vanga knew the &quot;Kursk&quot; bratushki trembled throughout 2007 for war with China or the chlorine accident in Bratsk ... Amateur statisticians have calculated that on Vanga predictions are correct in 58 to 80% of cases (according to other posts) ...

She say it to the date September 11 and the attack on the World Trade Center, stated that &quot;brothers Americans will be hit by the attack of the steel birds.
So what awaits us in the near and not so near future?[/center]

Vanga is an old woman who used to live in my country (Bulgaria) before she died she told these predictions. She predicted her death, 9/11 and alot of stuff. All this may be true.

Do you believe in these predictions?

P.S. Sorry for the crappy English grammar, it was a shitload of text in Bulgarian so i just used google translator.</description>
