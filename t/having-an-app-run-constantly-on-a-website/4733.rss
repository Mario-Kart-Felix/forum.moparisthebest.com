    <title>Having an app run constantly on a website</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/having-an-app-run-constantly-on-a-website/4733</link>
    <description>Right, so I&#39;ve gone out and bought a website mainly because I have nothing better to do with my money. I want to host this chat server I have on it, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s going to send data at all unless it&#39;s being run via an applet. Can someone help me out with this one?</description>

              <p>What mopar said will indeed work, but in regards to hosting it on a different server, you can’t do it unless you have root access…I’ve considered before the possibly of running a cron job, assuming its a *nix server, but I never found out whether that would work.  Basically, it needs to run as an application (applet won’t work because it’s client side and does not have the permissions to initialize such objects as ServerSockets) and you can’t run it with limited access.</p>
<p>So your best bet is to run it off your own computer.</p>

<p>to host the server on your computer, you just have to run it, plus open any port on your router that it uses</p>

              <p>I’ve seen alot of your posts about this chat server. Im actually doing the same thing at the moment. Run the client as an applet on the site (Just use a frame if you want it to stay there while the user browses), and host the server on your own computer. If you need any help with this, Id be glad to give ya a hand =)</p>
