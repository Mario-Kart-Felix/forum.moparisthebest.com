‹ Building Entertainment

[b]Behind the Scenes:[/b] Well, basically to make a long story short there were a couple of people who wanted to start a great server.  Now, don&#39;t get me wrong this isn&#39;t finished or anywhere near that however it does contain potential.  The fact that we are hard working, dedicated and unique coders is where this shines.  Our staff, which is small in numbers but talented in their own ways are listed below:

[b]Some Extra Information:[/b]

Our goal is to make it as fun as possible.  We also have some performance upgrades which will run the server very smoothly.  First off, we have a VPS which is at premium level.  Next off we have a very small process in our client class.  We&#39;d also like to have as many quests as possible, and a very great Pking stand point.  Hey, even I like to player kill.

[i]Video of a quest being built:[/i] [url=http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl9xc05nqtI]http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl9xc05nqtI[/url]
Note: NPC&#39;s will most likely be more far apart

[i]Video of combat in Devolution-X:[/i] [url=http://nz.youtube.com/watch?v=1ikfswcX4-g]http://nz.youtube.com/watch?v=1ikfswcX4-g[/url] 

I&#39;d have pictures, but until we have more things done with the server, there won&#39;t be any.  I&#39;ll also update it time to time so you guys can get a feeling of this development. 

Oh yeah one more thing.  Killamess tends to focus on the emotions, player killing and little bugs.  He fixed up the weapon animations, made Pking so amazing I couldn&#39;t even believe it.  The only thing he has to add now to get it almost perfect, is special attacks without the unwanted bar.  We&#39;ll make it our own so we won&#39;t be using any quests.

Till&#39; then, bye!</description>
