    <title>[C#] How would I do this with threads. [Solved, thanks guys.]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/c-how-would-i-do-this-with-threads-solved-thanks-guys/404225</link>
    <description>I&#39;m writing a program in C# that loads a list of proxies and filters the working ones out from the dead ones. The working proxies are put in a separate list that will eventually be savable. I&#39;m having a problem with the threading, though. 

[code=csharp]
private void startButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            checking = proxyList.Items.Count;
            statusBox.Text = &quot;Starting to filter.&quot;;
            for (int i = 0; i &lt;= proxyList.Items.Count - 1; i++)  {
                checkProxys();
            }
        }

        public void checkProxys()
        {
                int index = 0;
                string occoultProxy = proxyList.Items[index].ToString();
                Console.WriteLine(occoultProxy);
                try
                {

                    WebProxy proxy = new WebProxy(occoultProxy.Split(&#39;:&#39;)[0], Convert.ToInt32(occoultProxy.Split(&#39;:&#39;)[1]));
                    WebRequest web = WebRequest.Create(serverBox.Text.ToString());
                    web.Proxy = proxy;
                    web.Timeout = Convert.ToInt32(timeoutbox.Text);
                    Console.WriteLine(proxy.Address.ToString());
                    web.GetResponse();
                    filterProxy(index, true);
                    index++;
                }
                catch (Exception ex)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
                    filterProxy(index, false);
                    beenChecked++;
                    index++;
            }
        }
[/code]

Instead of using a loop statement I want to use a thread, or better yet, multiple threads. I&#39;ve already tried creating a thread and running checkProxys() through it but the threads either close, or they don&#39;t do anything at all, and I&#39;m completely lost at why.

Here is how I did it with threading I guess.

[code=csharp]
 private void startButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            checking = proxyList.Items.Count;
            statusBox.Text = &quot;Starting to filter.&quot;;
            Thread mainThread = new Thread(
                       new ThreadStart(checkProxys));
            mainThread.start();

        }
[/code]
I kept the checkProxys() method the same.

Here is my filterProxys() method, if it&#39;s of any help.
[code=csharp]
        void filterProxy(int Index, bool Valid)
        {
            try
            {
                if (Valid)
                {
                    checkedList.Items.Add(proxyList.Items[Index]);
                    proxyList.Items.RemoveAt(Index);
                }
                else
                {
                    proxyList.Items.RemoveAt(Index);
                }
            }
            catch
            {
            }
        }
[/code]

I&#39;ve attached the source if it&#39;s of any help with solving my problem. Most my work has been done in the main.cs, so look there.</description>

              <p>I’m pretty sure I’m checking one after another. The filterProxy() deletes the proxy from the list after it has been validated so there is no chance of checking the same one twice. The code is really messy though and I need to remove that index crap. I’ve been messing with it, trying different things and haven’t been cleaning up after myself.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Why would the index need to be Global? It’s all encapsulated in the same class.</p>

<p>Is that exactly how it was, because you’re not starting the thread.</p>

<p>I have a few ideas on what exactly could be going wrong, but i need to see more.</p>
<p>Also, inside the checkProxy() method, whats the point of the ‘index’ variable. You may not be using it like you think you are.</p>

              <p>Sorry, I guess it is poorly explained. I want to know how to make the checkProxys() method, process through a thread, or multiple threads so that the program will be MUCH faster, but I keep having troubles with the threads closing and going inactive on me, and I have no clue why. I’ve Google’d the errors but nothing relevant comes up, as they are pretty vague.</p>

              <p>I’m writing a program in C# that loads a list of proxies and filters the working ones out from the dead ones. The working proxies are put in a separate list that will eventually be savable. I’m having a problem with the threading, though.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">private void startButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            checking = proxyList.Items.Count;
            statusBox.Text = "Starting to filter.";
            for (int i = 0; i &lt;= proxyList.Items.Count - 1; i++)  {
                checkProxys();
            }
        }

        public void checkProxys()
        {
                int index = 0;
                string occoultProxy = proxyList.Items[index].ToString();
                Console.WriteLine(occoultProxy);
                try
                {

                    WebProxy proxy = new WebProxy(occoultProxy.Split(':')[0], Convert.ToInt32(occoultProxy.Split(':')[1]));
                    WebRequest web = WebRequest.Create(serverBox.Text.ToString());
                    web.Proxy = proxy;
                    web.Timeout = Convert.ToInt32(timeoutbox.Text);
                    Console.WriteLine(proxy.Address.ToString());
                    web.GetResponse();
                    filterProxy(index, true);
                    index++;
                }
                catch (Exception ex)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
                    filterProxy(index, false);
                    beenChecked++;
                    index++;
            }
        }</code></pre>
<p>Instead of using a loop statement I want to use a thread, or better yet, multiple threads. I’ve already tried creating a thread and running checkProxys() through it but the threads either close, or they don’t do anything at all, and I’m completely lost at why.</p>
<p>Here is how I did it with threading I guess.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> private void startButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            checking = proxyList.Items.Count;
            statusBox.Text = "Starting to filter.";
            Thread mainThread = new Thread(
                       new ThreadStart(checkProxys));
            mainThread.start();

        }</code></pre>
<p>I kept the checkProxys() method the same.</p>
<p>Here is my filterProxys() method, if it’s of any help.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        void filterProxy(int Index, bool Valid)
        {
            try
            {
                if (Valid)
                {
                    checkedList.Items.Add(proxyList.Items[Index]);
                    proxyList.Items.RemoveAt(Index);
                }
                else
                {
                    proxyList.Items.RemoveAt(Index);
                }
            }
            catch
            {
            }
        }</code></pre>
<p>I’ve attached the source if it’s of any help with solving my problem. Most my work has been done in the main.cs, so look there.</p>
