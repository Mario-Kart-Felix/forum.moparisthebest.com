<p>If you just want to play a server that actually has an active owner who fixes stuff when bug reports are posted…this is for you.</p>
<p>If you are like me though you need more than just that you need somebody who understands how an economy really works and what ti takes. Some of the recent updates that have been announced to happen will absolutely destroy what little of an eco this server actually had. I, for one, refuse to stand around and watch what I was involved with just crumble from below my very feet.</p>

<p>So yeah there are my thoughts.</p>

<p>Hehe, nothing malicious there, it was encrypted first cause of webclient. bastards downloaded jar and came online with reflection client. Spawned trees and stuff all over the place. Had exe client for a while, then had to change.<br>
Keytool there is from jaring. I forgot to change cache auto download link and had to jar new client in hurry. Forgot to delete keytool from signing that jar, and kept bat for those who been playing around with winrar and cant run jars for some reason.<br>

<p>Ty. Any questions, ask. I can share open source, original page…etc. Or link what i used to encrypt with. Panic over keytool in client folder just shows how little java knowlage some users here has.</p>

<p>Never mind, got to restore page without encryption… lost original page. Ill explain again why i have it encrypted just in case. I used to have executive client and webclient. Webclient page was encrypted to stop jar download for rookies. Encrypted page hide main class and jar adress. Client was refactored to stop reflection clients beeing attached to it. As far as i could tell, it worked. After all that trouble i didnt see any webs or random trees in server anymore. Downside was that executive client was really not very trusted download, and it didnt work for mac and other weird name OS. So i had to switch back to jar. If any staff member wants, i can share open source client just for checks.</p>

<p>Crap, forgot. It was originally 30 days, but changed to permenent. Forgot to change it in forums.<br>
And thanks for showing client lol, forgot to remove bat and keytool.</p>
<p>Allso about that premium. Afterall, we host rsps. Asking over $2 for premium or member , however we call it, is sin. Players usually quit after month-two. So heres when that permenent and monthly comes handy. If you wanna try out, you try for $2. Amount is small and even if you regreat it later, loss is minimal. But if you like what you get for it, you can add just some extra and have it permenetly.<br>
Thanks for suggestions, client and typos fixed.</p>

<p>Yea, server was released today morning, and bugs are just showing up <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> after fixes, more content coming.<br>
But when it comes to content like gambling, weird minigames and 50k customs… not gonna happen. I will never ever add any feature that compromises stability or makes server look messy. Server right now is very clean, uses under 100k memory while having really detailed skilling and combat.<br>
Thanks for comments <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
