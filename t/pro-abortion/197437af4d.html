You can’t take myspace seriously. Most of it’s a load anyways. I can’t answer for God, he may not heal amputees. Does that mean he doesn’t exist? No, it just means he doesn’t heal amputees.</p>

        <p>it makes them very uncomfortable when they have to think about it, so they just accept it and don’t try to explain it,<br>
so they rational minds can be along side their irrational ones</p>
<p>its a lot like Doublethink from Nineteen Eighty-Four</p>
<p>and chrisn2323, there are christens who force their opinions on others too, in a much more terrible way then atheists.<br>
when spanish people came to america, the aztecs believed they were gods because of their superior technology,<br>
anything far advanced beyond you seems like magic,<br>
and the spanish missionaries used and abused this god-like privilege, they forced their religion onto the aztec people, sure in the belief that it was the only true religion</p>
<p>^^ obviously not all christians are like that</p>
<p>another way you force your beliefs is on your children, who are too young to decide which religion you are,<br>
no-one says “this a marxist-child, a liberal-child, a conservative-child”<br>
so how can people say “this is a christian-child, a muslim-child, a jewish-child”<br>
its only a child of christian parents, or muslim parents or whatever.</p>

Actually I’d like to say that I see more christians trying to “Force” their views onto people but that would be <span class="bbcode-b">Prejudice</span>. Plus you cannot back these arguements up with proof, because no one in their right mind sits there and notes down when ever another person from another religion trys to force their views onto people. Therefore our arguements would both be <span class="bbcode-b">invalid</span>.</p>

        <p>I think that if you read the Bible, and lead a Christian life, you’d be a great person.  The Bible’s purpose wasn’t to cause conflict between those who believe and those who don’t - it was supposed to provide an example of how to be a good person - I’m guessing.</p>
<p>Christianity is a brilliant religion (Some of the most famous religions usually are brilliant), just because the people who call themselves Christians now-a-days are - or can be - very arrogant and forceful of their religion, doesn’t mean that every Christian’s like that, or that believing in God makes you like that.</p>
<p>It just means that person isn’t a good Christian.  Personally, I’d say that the majority of Christians can’t back up deep arguments like this one because they haven’t studied the Bible much at all, or took much interest in Christianity.</p>

Even a 7 year old kid is talking bullshit like hes mindless because it’s true at 7 year they got no brains its just primitive reaction, you really can’t tell who is really alive or not it’s all random whose brain develops slower or faster. Also do you remember anything about how you were born? memories anything? see no you don’t because you had no mind, no consciousness. It gets implanted by god when you are older and your brain is mature enough to understand anything! its like swimming in a sea of intellectualism</p>

        <p>[quote=“I Br3ndan I, post:88, topic:197437”]I think that if you read the Bible, and lead a Christian life, you’d be a great person.  The Bible’s purpose wasn’t to cause conflict between those who believe and those who don’t - it was supposed to provide an example of how to be a good person - I’m guessing.</p>
<p>Christianity is a brilliant religion (Some of the most famous religions usually are brilliant), just because the people who call themselves Christians now-a-days are - or can be - very arrogant and forceful of their religion, doesn’t mean that every Christian’s like that, or that believing in God makes you like that.</p>
<p>It just means that person isn’t a good Christian.  Personally, I’d say that the majority of Christians can’t back up deep arguments like this one because they haven’t studied the Bible much at all, or took much interest in Christianity.[/quote]<br>
I totally agree with what I Br3ndan I is saying. My english teacher is a prime example of how a normal people should be, even though she is christian. She is nice and she would never force anything on anyone. I even sat down with her once and discussed bible stuff with her and she was totally cool about everything.</p>
<p>Weird thing is, these days people take advantage of people like her, for example people will mess around in her lessons because they know she will go easy on them. And because people take advantage of her I can see that she could change into someone who would want to change everyone around her (e.g. force her ways onto people). But she is strong, and she doesn’t try to change whom is around her, she just leads her life in the way that she see’s right and this is why I think people like her are great people.</p>
<p>Of course you can be Athiest, Muslim, Jewish or not even have a religion to act like this.</p>
<p>Sorry I went a bit off topic and now my head is flying around with other thoughts so I can’t be bothered to write more.</p>

        <p>Today in R.E I watched a video about abortion.  Surprisingly, alot of people in my class didn’t even know how it happened initially; some thought a pill or tablet was all that was required.  What really happens is terribly awful and extremely horrible (The method I saw carried out in this video anyway; there are several methods doctors use).</p>
<p>Firstly, the doctor dilates the cervix by force, and then pushes a ‘sucking’ tool into the cervix and up into the womb.  When he’s done that, he prods the womb and sucks all of the liquid out, then prods again, bringing down a sort of ‘shield’ of muscle protecting the baby.  Once that’s done, the doctor uses the ‘sucking’ tool to rip off the baby’s limbs, and torso, leaving the head.  Finally, the doctor stuffs tongs into the womb and grabs the head, then crushes it by squeezing the tongs, and pulls it out.</p>
<p>During all of this, the baby is kicking and swimming around trying to escape the tools that were coming to it.  This video was the first time anyone had ever seen the baby’s actions during abortion (It’s a kinda old video).  It was disgusting.  We’re disgusting.</p>
<p>The baby’s mouth opened a couple of times, and the professor who was guiding us through the video said that the baby was naturally trying to scream out of fear, but produced no noise.  He called it a silent scream.  The baby was trying to hide in the corner of the womb.  He said it was a pathetic attempt to escape.</p>
<p>He was totally against abortion, and man, my mind was settled, but now it cannot be unsettled.  Abortion should not be allowed.  It’s disgusting, and only shows how we, as humans, can be extremely selfish and uncaring for the life of other beings - even beings that aren’t humans.</p>
<p>On a side note: Sounds like a really sweet person, David.   :rolleyes:</p>

        <p>I Br3ndan I, the procedure you described is only used if the pregnancy is in late stages</p>
<p>in most cases, when the pregnancy is early, drugs are taken to induce labour</p>
<p>your teacher (who is against abortion) obviously showed you that exaggerated opinion to try to convince you,<br>
thats not allowed in the UK, teachers are forbidden to influence their students options like that, they are not even allowed to tell us who they vote for.</p>
<p>btw, that “shield” of muscle is called a placenta.</p>
<p>also realise that if you ban abortion, young girls will go to the village, where an old lady will do a similar procedure to what you described, except this one will leave the girl infertile.</p>
<p>if showing you a horrific video is enough to convince you of believing something, perhaps you should watch a video about what happens in palastine and guantanamo bay.<br>
its interesting how people will stand up for the life of an unborn child but will happy slaughter 9 year olds.</p>
<p>its time you realise that, X is gory and horrific does not not imply X is wrong.</p>

        <p>It does imply it’s wrong.  And it is.  In what way is abortion ‘right’?  I don’t want to get into other subjects that are relevant in accordance to the morale issues presented here, because I know about them.</p>
<p>I know that the video was to make sure I hated abortion, I think about these things during such events.  I don’t care though, the video and its contents were right in doing so.  It’s completely wrong and utterly disgusting.  No matter what way it’s carried out.</p>

<p>I hate war aswell.  I hate violence.  Was that aimed at me in some way… because dude, I totally hate everything you hate.  I’ve acknowledged that others don’t care and I don’t care as much as I should, and that I actually can make a difference, but I’m just too selfish to do so.  I know all of this.  And I hate myself for it, genuinely.</p>
<p>I don’t know… this stuff is so deep.  They’re simple, but other humans have gone and ruined it all and introduced excuses for doing the actions (Like waging war…).  I’m not smart enough to go into detail about stuff like that, and I’m certainly not experienced enough.  I just know what’s right and wrong.</p>
