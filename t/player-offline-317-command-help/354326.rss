    <title>Player Offline? [317] command help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-offline-317-command-help/354326</link>
    <description>Ok well basically, my command works perfectly fine if the player is online, does everything i want it to, only it&#39;s no use to me if the player is online as it&#39;s an ip ban command. I can&#39;t un ipban someone that&#39;s online, because obviously they&#39;re not going to be online...

I&#39;ve tried
[code]
if(Server.playerHandler.players[i] == null) {
[/code]

That didn&#39;t work...

I also tried
[code]
if(Server.playerHandler.playersCurrentlyOn[i] == null) {
[/code]

That didn&#39;t work either, so i&#39;m wondering what would check if the player is offline?

If anyone could help me it&#39;d be much appreciated.</description>
