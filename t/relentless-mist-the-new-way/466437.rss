[B]Welcome to Relentless-Mist, I myself Mist (Mac)am the founder of the server, I have just recently opened it. I have based the server off of player killing in the earlier stages of RuneScape, Such as when Bounty Hunter was around. I wanted the server to mere how Bounty Hunter was during that Runescape Era, and I have done so quite professionally with help from some friends. I have finally decided to host it because the combat is near-perfected. Everything is almost flawless and such.[/B][/center]

Features:

Prayer fix ( switching prayers has effect delays to match rs , so you can do specials without players praying )
Bounty Hunter Scoreboards ( ACTUALLY WORKING )
Most damage gets drop ( with damage reseting perfect for luring in BH )
Target Cap, no more then 3 people can get 1 person as a target
Full private chat without crashing.
Full Magicks book ( all spells, not just barrage/maismic spells, but every single ancient spell )
Barrows degrade when dropped on death
Perfect Switching [ unreleased and no dupes ]
Perfect Potting (single/double dose)
Deposit all in bank working
Potion Mixing
Corperal Beast
Sound Effects for eating, attacking, pvp, music, pvm.
Summoning
Makeover Mage Fully Redone

Small Fixes:
No diagonal attacking/ attacking if standing on the same spot as somebody
Veng saving ( after 30 seconds you can&#39;t cast another veng until your first one Fades and veng saves even if you logout/back in )
Magic immunity ( so you don&#39;t get refrozen right after the freeze fades )
Autocast small fix ( can&#39;t auto cast if you arent on ancients, not the gay emote it does if somebody forgets to switch to ancients )
When you have enough barrage runes, your spellbook will always have the spells Highlighted, doesn&#39;t randomly unhighlight like other z508s.
100% penalties, saves on logout, and shows the penalties on the bounty hunter Interface even if you log in and out.
Real max hit calculator ( Tested with all the max hit calculators )

I will post more server media, the server has been out for a full day now and already has reached 10+ players. It&#39;s a growing fun community, I can&#39;t wait to see everyone coming and playing.

Thanks,
Mist
