    <description>[b][u]This is a serious topic.  Anyone spamming will be moderated without warning.[/u][/b]

Well everyone needs to know how to make money.

[b][u]Skilling Methods:[/u][/b]
[b]Woodcutting:[/b]
Once you get to level 60 woodcutting (65-70 is much better) you are able to cut yews.  Yews sell for roughly 500 gp each, and sell almost instantly.  I do not advise cutting magics at all, they are extremely slow (even compared to yews) and are only twice as much.

[b]Mining:[/b]
You can mine iron at 15, and coal at 30.  Both are pretty good money making levels.

[b]Fishing:[/b]
At level 45 you catch lobsters. 

[b]Runecrafting:[/b]
At level 45 you can craft nature runes.  Nature runes are used in quite a few popular spells, so the demand for them is pretty high.

[b]Hunter:[/b]
At level 63 you can hunt red chinchompas.  These currently sell for roughly 618 each, and they are what most people hunt to get 99.  (47,796 are needed at 618 each, which is 29,537,928gp).  Hunter is also a fast skill to train.

[b]Farming Herbs:[/b]
Ranarr and snapdragon are the best, and can be farmed starting at level 32.

[b]Fletching/Alching Yew Long:[/b] For this to work, you have to do one of the following manually: Cut the logs, spin the flax, or get the Nature Runes. Whichever you choose you can buy the rest. You make profit and get great experience, which can be for fletching and magic, and either crafting, woodcutting, or runecrafting. (Thanks Lin).
[b]Buy flax and spin it (Unless prices changed)[/b] (Thanks Lin)

[b][u]Combat Methods:[/u][/b]
Kill Green Dragons sell both bones and hide. Last time I checked it&#39;s about 4K per dragon. (Thanks Lin)

[b][u]Other Methods:[/u][/b]
Note: The following method is great, but be sure you are the only person doing it! I HIGHLY recommend 67 agility!
Start off by buying a bunch of Faladar Teletabs, an anti-dragon shield, energy potions, and anything to reduce weight. Go to Falador with only 1-3 energy potions (3 if you don&#39;t have 67 agility) and your teletabs. Equip your weight-reducing stuff and anti-dragon shield and head to the Taverly Dungeon. If you have 67 agility, climb through the pipe to blue dragons. If not, run around. ALWAYS make sure run is on, and when you get low, drink your energy potions. Start collecting blue dragon scales. As soon as your inventory is full, teleport to Falador, bank the scales, restock on energy potions, and repeat. Once you&#39;re finished, grind the scales into dust (Unless scales sell for more. It&#39;s been a while), and then sell them. If I remember right, they sell for 600gp each. (Thanks Lin [size=1pt]little prick noticed that I forgot to mention him on this one[/size])


There are many more methods, feel free to post ones you have and I will be happy to add them here.</description>

              <p>This is a money making methods thread, although botting is an option, it is also off topic too at the sametime, as I said before If you level 100+ and have 68+ summoning then I req you tank out bandos and other bosses.</p>
<p>If you level is less then 100, do the giant mole, or even do PvM ( player vs monster), I suggest ring of wealth with cockroach soldiers, mainly on the 3rd to 4th floor because those places are never crowded.</p>
<p>Cockroach soldiers are about level 85 and drop very good drops. 1 of my runs I brought back 2k gp, 150 law runes, 20 addy ores, 21 mith ores and 2 rune scimitars.</p>
<p>Ring of wealth is an EXTREMELY GOOD for PvM, due to the fact that it gives you a better chance on getting a good drop.</p>
<p>Thank you:</p>

<p>You’re talking about how you bought a bot…  Is that on topic?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m not shoving “it” in everyones face… I’m shoving the fact that you lied about getting, “1 or 2 phats” in a drop party in YOUR face.  I’m pretty sure that you would know if you one 1 or 2 phats.  And it was only a 5b drop party, so are you saying that you got both of the 2 drops in a world that would have hundreds of people in the same spot?   I doubt it.   And now I can happily say that iMaduGetMadBro.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
