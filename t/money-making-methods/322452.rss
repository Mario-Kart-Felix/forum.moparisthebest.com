    <title>Money Making Methods</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/money-making-methods/322452</link>
    <description>I get alot of questions from you all:
&quot;how do i make money&quot;
&quot;what should i merch&quot;
&quot;what should i flip&quot;

so i thought id take the time out to give you all some tips :)

First of all when &quot;making money&quot; on runescape it really depends on how much you want to profit, and how much time you want to spend.
You could spend 2 weeks waiting at bandos for a 20M drop or you can cut magic trees for 2 weeks and make a guaranteed profit.

[size=18pt][b]Combat Methods:[/b][/size]
warning: please do not try these methods by yourself if you are unfamiliar, thats how people die :p
[b][size=18pt]Bandos [u]coinshare[/size][/u][/b]
  - these are usually 3-4 man teams to ensure a good split of items
  - requirements are usually 120+ or less if you are a tanker (with full guthans)
  - a godsword is usually required
  - 68 summoning is usually a requirement
[b][size=18pt]Bandos [u]lootshare[/size][/u][/b]
  - these are usually &#39;mass&#39; teams from as little as 8 people to as many as 20.
  - godswords are usually required, sometimes you may be let off with a whip
  - requirements are usually 110+ unless you are a guthans tanker
  - this method does not always guarantee you money.

[b][size=18pt]Saradomin [u]coinshare[/size][/u][/b]
  - generally speaking saradomin godwars is a coinshare activity teams consist for around 5 members
  - requirements are 120+ for a team and 70+ agility to access the dungeon
  - a zamorak godsword or higher is usually required
  - good armour is also usually required
  - 68+ summoning is usually required.
[b][size=18pt]Saradomin [u]lootshare[/size][/u][/b]
  - same requirements as lootshare beside:
          - summoning
          - godswords
          - armour

[b][size=18pt]Zamorak [u]coinshare[/size][/u][/b]
  - generally 120+ teams of around 4-5 people
  - godswords are required
  - good armour is required
  - 68+ summoning is also usually required.
[b][size=18pt]Zamorak [u]lootshare[/size][/u][/b]
  - generally 110+ with teams of around 8-10 people
  - good armour and a godsword is a general requirement
  - you may be allowed to range or whip the boss
  - a unicorn is a big help as the boss poisons you.

[b][size=18pt]Armadyl [u]coinshare &amp; lootshare[/size][/u][/b]
  - 90+ range
  - 85+ defence
  - 68+ summoning
  - diamond/ruby bolts (e)
  - armadyl chest plate and skirt (karils is also acceptable)
  - dragonfire shield (spirit and crystal shields are also acceptable)
  - ranger boots/infinity boots

*note:*
  - when soloing these monsters, please use &#39;pro gear&#39; such as saradomin godswords and bandos armour.
  - i strongly recommend you try these out with a friend in a team before attempting a solo as it is very risky, the first time i solo&#39;d bandos i lost over 30M :p

[size=18pt]Dagganoth Kings:[/size]
[b]solo&amp;team[/b]
  - Veracs armour
  - Slayer dart spell
  - infinity boots
  - a healing familiar
  - good defence and magic

[size=18pt]Corporal Beast:[/size]
WARNING: this monster is incredibly hard to defeat, i have never heard of someone soloing it, this is a TEAM activity. Please be wise when trying this monster as you will most likely die atleast once.
  - high defence
  - high range/attack/strength
  - zamorak spear 
  - be willing to maybe lose some items/money

[size=18pt]Barrows:[/size]
thanks to cows be scared
  - recommended 70+ attack strength defence mage and range
  - good armour/weapon
  - Saradomin Godswords and guthans are very helpfull here they are a source of healing as you cannot use summoning
[b]method one:[/b]
this is the method i generally use:
sgs and guthans, black salamander and bones to peaches tabs.
sgs spec hits hard and heals prayer and health.
you can use your guthans too heal in the tunnels and collect the bones too make more food with the tabs

[b]method two:[/b]
you may choose to only use melee.
good setup for this is:
guthans, bones to peaches and sgs.
if you dont have an sgs any gs or strong weapon accompanied by a spec weapon ie: dds is very handy for speccing karils/ahrims.
i find melee doesnt always hit very well on some of the brothers.

[b]method three:[/b]
slayer dart is also another easy method you can trap most brothers and farcast them.
slayer dart is a cheap strong spell if you&#39;re wondering why not something else.
also bring bones to peaches its a very handing thing to have.

[size=18pt]Aviansies:[/size]
thanks to cows be scared
  - 70+ ranged and defence
  - Zamorak item, Saradomin item and Aramdyl item, or you will get pwned :p
  - if you are abit on the noob side and have low defence you can use prayer, this is not as effective as tanking them, when tanking with bones to peaches you can stay there for weeks on end until you run out of tabs
  - bring alches to alch rune items
  - wearing a ring of wealth does not increase your bars:kills it will get you more rune items.

[size=18pt]Kalphite Queen:[/size]
  - this is a hard monster to solo i have no tried it myself
  - you will need 70+ defence and full veracs.
  - i really suggest this too anyone who is over 115 combat f2p or this monster to be fought in a team.
  - the only con about KQ now is that a dragon chain is around 7M at the most meaning its alot of effort for a small prize

Credits too Chassy13

[size=18pt]Merchanting:[/size]
when merchanting, your merch can either go really well or really shit, you have to be willing to invest alot of money, be patient and not ragequit if you lose.
the key too merchanting is the grand exchange graphs.
to find an item to merchant use these graphs:
http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/top100.ws?list=3&amp;scale=0
this is the section for items that have fallen the highest percentage in price.
stay away from new items or unstable items.
choose an item that is used commonly ie: dressy hats, armours, wepons.
DO NOT GET GREEDY AND KEEP YOUR ITEM TOO LONG YOU WILL LOSE.

[size=19pt]Flipping:[/size]
The key too flipping an item is simple:
buy out an item, wait until the next update, and sell it higher then you bought.
try and aim for around 3% profit, it doesnt sound much, but you can make ~1M an update if done correctly.
use an item which is bought frequently, be cautious flipping items which are dropping.
you can generally flip any item.
in this case new items can be good too flip as they rise highly in price from demand.

*note:*
  - do not try and buy an item that is not high in supply in demand, its stupid and you will get no where.

[size=18pt][b]Quick &amp;&amp; Easy money makers:[/b][/size]

[size=18pt][b]Unicorn Horns[/b][/size]
very easy method, simply kill black unicorns near stealing creations in low level wild and bank at the wilderness volcano each horn sells for abit over 1kea.
(around 600k an hr if you can kill them fast enough)
they will always sell as they are a secondary ingredient in combat potions

[size=18pt][b]Ranarr potions (unf)[/b][/size]
this is another easy method but requires you too have previous money,
buy as many ranarrs and water filled vials as you can and simply put them in the vials
you make around 600k in 1 hour by doing 2k unf potions
(thats 1k unf pots in 30 minutes, this is a rough estimation)

[size=18pt][b]Slayer[/b][/size]
slayer is another handy money making method this can be very usefull for people who want too train their slayer, combat and make some decent money along the way. Most slayer monsters will drop some decent items. dont skip tasks you cant be bothered with, just do them. when i get metal dragon tasks i usually get atleast 1 pair of d legs and a d skirt.

[size=18pt][b]Clue Scrolls[/b][/size]
these do not always get you good rewards ive had 30k rewards from level 3 clue scrolls before
these can also be very dangerous when your clue lands you in the wilderness.
For more information on clue scrolls:
http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Clue_scroll

[size=18pt][b]House Tabs[/b][/size]
simply buy clay, find an open house you can use with a studyroom and a lectern and make Teleport to House tabs. Im unsure of the gp/hr ratio on this method as i havent used it in a while, but im sure it still works

[size=18pt][b]Flax Picking/Bow String Making[/b][/size]
i had too add this for all the noobs :p
simply pick flax and spin it :p

[url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,418861.msg3119246.html#msg3119246][size=18pt][b]Herblore - lantadyme potion[/size][/b][/url]
credits to Eh Pretty Easy
 - level 67 required

[size=18pt][b]Summoning - Fruitbat Fruitfall scroll[/b][/size]
 - level 69 summoning required
 - items needed: fruitbat pouch ~1k fruitfall scrolls
summon your fruitbat and cast the fruitfall scroll until the special energy bar is empty, pick up the papaya&#39;s and repeat.
fruitfall scroll: 230gpea
papaya: 1.7kea
700k-1.2M per hour profit.

If you have anymore questions please ask :p
If you have any helpfull methods too add post them and i will add them :)</description>

-Craft bars into plain gold bracelets<br>
-Alch the bracelets for 330gp</p>
<p>If you get all the listed equipment @ med price you’ll loose 1gp per alch, however as gold bars nearly always buy @ minimum because of people craft gold ore -&gt; bars for great smithing XP with gautlents, you will probably make a small profit.</p>
<p>Note: its 25k XP per 1k bracelets you craft, and 65k XP per 1k alchs.</p>

Keep an eye on the graphs. If the item dropped 54gp that day, buy the herbs 54gp below mid, sell the unfinished potions 54gp below mid. I did ranarrs when the herb and unfinished potion were both rising. This meant that it was harder to buy the herbs than it was to sell the final product, thus adding an element of safety.<br>
If you’re smart about it then it’s hard not to make reasonable gains.</p>

<p>Not including the cost of the extra (which is an eye of newt, so they’re pretty cheap anyway), super attacks cost 20gp/experience point. This is, believe it or not, quite reasonable.<br>
Some potions cost anywhere from 30 - 50gp/experience point to make.</p>

<p>I can’t give you a definitive answer, sorry. But they’re moving like a regular item as far as the graph is concerned.<br>
Super attacks and super strengths are two of the most important potions in the game, making them easy for people who make them to sell. With that said, I don’t see why the (unf) potions wouldn’t sell.<br>

The only one that I can definitively say that will sell, due to experience, is ranarr pot (unf).<br>
I believe kwuarm pot (unf) would be extremely popular as well (because kwuarm is used in super strength potions).</p>
<p>I don’t think you’ll have any trouble selling them.</p>
