You can either keep windows and add ubuntu, or remove windows completely and install ubuntu. You will lose all of your windows files unless backed up on a flash drive or something like that. You also might want to have access to a wired connection, because sometimes you need to install missing network drivers (happened to me twice, pain in the ass).</p>

You can use the Ubuntu LiveCD to test out any and all features of a fresh installation of Ubuntu, without installing it. If, at some point, you decide that you would like to install it alongside, or even over the current windows installation, there is an installation wizard to help you through that process on the LiveCD.<br>

<p>The LiveCD allows him to install it immediately after testing. Otherwise it would look something like</p>
