The numbers are right, i’ve said this numerous times in the past. 9/11 was $1T instantly (actually 1.4T over a week), the wars were $1T over a decade (while also benefiting private industry), and the housing market collapse threw us into the recession.[/quote]<br>

<p>That is also what you claim Obama spend. (That also is a wrong number)</p>

By time Clinton came along the internet boom was fueling everything and the collapse was being covered up. 9/11 happened only a few months into Bush’s first term, which is when the president is most vulnerable and he was preoccupied.  And the market collapse was right on the line of Bush/Obama, so really you can’t place it under anyone. I wouldn’t blame Obama either, but I would blame him on fucking up his stimulus that would have worked. Personally I think the damage was already done by time Clinton left, those loans were already given out and soon there would be a collapse.</p>

<p>Not to mention we’re about to hit a double dip recession very very soon.</p>

What? Obviously republicans wont support most of the stuff Obama pushes, and thats what a balanced congress is supposed to do. But siding with the republicans was the ONLY way to stop the default, because democrats couldn’t get enough votes to push theirs through. But Obama didn’t want to cave in even though he had no other option. So he had an option, and had he also vetoed that one and let the country default he could have been impeached. Before republicans took the house Obama would shut them out anyway.</p>

Both wars totaled $1T over a decade. Obama spent $2.9T over 3 years. The debt ceiling raises under bush were made with ‘promises’ (by congress) that in the future cuts would be made, and congress never made cuts. That is why this time the cuts came with the raise in a nice little bundle.</p>

The housing market collapse originated under carter and was supported by following presidents. It basically pressured banks to give loans to people they normal wouldn’t due to credit or whatever. I can’t stand when people blame the collapse on Bush, or on Clinton. Bush was really only noteable for the wars and tax cuts for the rich.</p>

<p>But Obama was shitting bricks because the republican bill had enough votes to pass, but the democrats bill did not. So he repeatedly vetoed the republican bill because he wasn’t getting his way.

I know all about the political ‘game’. Voting is compulsory in Australia, and that immediately implies compulsory idiocy.<br>
I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that Australian politicians are first class when it comes to talking shit about the opposition, even if they lack their own thought-out policies entirely (which is quite often the case in recent years, heh). <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
