    <title>How to ban people:</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-ban-people/1818</link>
    <description>I am in no way encouraging this, I just want to discuss it. I do believe it is morally wrong. 


I was thinking...

If Jagex is just bullshitting about their detection system of selling gp for real cash then it wouldnt work, but anyways:

According to them, when you trade someone large amounts of money with nothing of the same value in return, then they can detect that your selling things. And according to them they check the messages that you say, so if you talk to them about buying gp and stuff, then they&#39;ll know for sure and ban you. 

So, what would happen if you went up to someone and said &quot;Here is that million gp you bought off ebay&quot;, and then traded them a million gp for free. Would they get banned? I mean there&#39;s no way in hell they are going to refuse the offer of 1 million gp even if they have no cue what your talking about. If you had an enemy you could do thisl it would cost a million gp but if your one of those autoers who make millions a day then it&#39;d be no problem lol. Anyways, I wont be testing it. It would be interesting to test it on a mule accountt hough, and see if Jagex notices.</description>

<p>And on the same note if you were to buy gp off a website and have the seller come up to you and be like “Hey bud heard about you dieing man, here take this, it’ll help you get back on your feet.”  Then you be like, “Wow thanks man, I’ll pay you back as soon as I can.”  You just got yourself covered.</p>

<p>Well, money is money. Autoed money does not have a seperate item id number, and has to be traced manually(I would think?).

<p>I’ll proxy on one account and use my normal ip on the other and delete my uid etc, and I’ll approach the account and say: “Here is that 1 million gp you bought off ebay” and I’ll trade it onto the account and see if it gets banned. If it does then I am pretty sure we have found a big flaw in their system because you could get anyone banned with this.</p>

              <p>And on the same note if you were to buy gp off a website and have the seller come up to you and be like “Hey bud heard about you dieing man, here take this, it’ll help you get back on your feet.”  Then you be like, “Wow thanks man, I’ll pay you back as soon as I can.”  You just got yourself covered.</p>

              <p>I am in no way encouraging this, I just want to discuss it. I do believe it is morally wrong.</p>
<p>I was thinking…</p>
<p>If Jagex is just bullshitting about their detection system of selling gp for real cash then it wouldnt work, but anyways:</p>
<p>According to them, when you trade someone large amounts of money with nothing of the same value in return, then they can detect that your selling things. And according to them they check the messages that you say, so if you talk to them about buying gp and stuff, then they’ll know for sure and ban you.</p>
<p>So, what would happen if you went up to someone and said “Here is that million gp you bought off ebay”, and then traded them a million gp for free. Would they get banned? I mean there’s no way in hell they are going to refuse the offer of 1 million gp even if they have no cue what your talking about. If you had an enemy you could do thisl it would cost a million gp but if your one of those autoers who make millions a day then it’d be no problem lol. Anyways, I wont be testing it. It would be interesting to test it on a mule accountt hough, and see if Jagex notices.</p>
