    <title>Server restarter Info Please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-restarter-info-please/378008</link>
    <description>on i need to find a auto restarter that can restart 2 servers at the same time. 

when i use my auto restarter on one server it automatically shuts down both servers that are running and only turns back on the server with the auto restarter. 

i host a 317 and a 508. any help would be fantastic.

im thinking maby if there is an auto restarter which u can change the process name like (RUN1.bat and RUN2.bat) so it will think its restarting 2 and not 2 .bats with the same process.

...if you did not understand the last part of what i said dont worry :)</description>
