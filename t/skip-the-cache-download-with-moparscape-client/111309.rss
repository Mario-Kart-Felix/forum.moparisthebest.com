    <title>Skip the cache download with moparscape client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/skip-the-cache-download-with-moparscape-client/111309</link>
    <description>i want to run a standalone server with no internet connection on my computer. i already have the cache, but everytime i run the moparscape client it tries to download the cache anyway.

the cache i have is 24.7MB from the actual rs game. i copied the .file_store_32 folder from a computer with an internet connection and pasted it onto my standalone computer. pretty sure i renamed the folder correctly and i know its in the right spot. i have tried putting all the files in the folder into a zip archive, just leaving them in the folder, making another folder...etc.

all i need to know is can i make the moparscape client skip trying to download the cache? :confused: (and obviously how to make it skip the download if i can)</description>

              <p>The newest cache you can use is the 377.<br>
You would need a 459 client and to build a 459 server for the current rs cache.<br>
But you would still need to make your client load the 377. o.0</p>

<p>same way i got the moparscape client/servers, different computer.</p>
<p>[quote=“VorargC, post:5, topic:111309”]You have to use the moparscape cache for the 317 client.<br>
And if you have that, make sure it is in C:/WINDOWS<br>
named .mpr_file_store_32<br>
I think ^[/quote]</p>
<p>so i can’t use the normal rs cache for moparscape?</p>
<p>the whole idea of this is that i can run a functional server on a lan at my house, with no computer needing an internet connection.</p>
<p>i should probably also mention that i have like 4 other clients because i downloaded the client/server pack. i have an eyrescape client and whatever else came in the pack. i wanted to use the moparscape client because it has the option to change ports + ip’s, and the other ones don’t have such a convenient feature. so it doesn’t absolutely have to be using the moparscape client if someone knows a way to do this with a different client.</p>

              <p>i think you kinda missed my whole point</p>
<p>very simply put:<br>
computer = not connected to the internet</p>
<p>cache download = not needed. already have the cache.</p>
<p>the client won’t advance until it downloads the cache. which i already have, so it doesn’t need to (and can’t anyway). already have my own server, which i have running.</p>
<p>i should probably make sure that i can use the moparscape client with my own server. that is possible right? i just assumed it was because you can change ip and ports.</p>
