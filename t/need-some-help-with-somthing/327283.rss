    <description>I&#39;ve tried tons of different servers, there are things i like different in each and every one of them. What i would like to do is: I&#39;d like to be able to get things from each one that i like and add to one specific server to make it nice, such as gwd stances, full god wars-3/4 boss&#39;s, certain area&#39;s, teleports, etc. But how do am i suppose to do this without totally screwing everything up? And this is just for me to do while i have down time etc i don&#39;t plan on releasing it to anyone. Mainly a few friends might play it.

Thanks</description>
