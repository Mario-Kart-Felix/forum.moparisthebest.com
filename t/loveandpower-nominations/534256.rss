    <title>Loveandpower - Nominations</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/loveandpower-nominations/534256</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;Loveandpower&quot;]Tutorials:

-personally...he has so many recently even if they are mostly snippets I feel Strucker should have some sort of recognition as he has been learning all at the same time and that&#39;s more than deserving in my eyes.

Developments:

-davidi2&#39;s/sinisouls mopar server
-arios 
-world 901
-rsc server mitb style yo

interviews: 
-Interview with Flame_ + Ambokile ?:D( I mean interview your own selves ) 
-I&#39;d also like to suggest perhaps Tabbykiller or Connhunter. I know Coon he is a great guy! :) I can&#39;t say what he does but some questions may not be able to be answered due to what he does. (which makes him very mysterious for the moparians who don&#39;t actually know him )[/quote]
I&#39;ll agree on having Strucker as a mentioned tutorial author. Perhaps this month, tutorial nominees can have their name mentioned along with their notable contributions.
I&#39;ll agree on the above mentioned developments, except for Arios. They&#39;ve been mentioned in previous editions and can probably be put on the side for the mention of a more recent development.
As for an interview among myself and Ambokile, I&#39;ll leave that up to the community for future editions. TabbyKiller and CoonHunter can be considered in the future as well. 
This month&#39;s interviewed member is going to be Newty, though.

Well, propose questions for Newty as I’m interviewing him Sunday afternoon. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
