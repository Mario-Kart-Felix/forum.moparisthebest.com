This has led to a host migration and t4 is now responsible for the server. We now have two nodes with one in Europe and one in America which is set to launch soon.

Nice post, looking forward to more. If you guys have any suggestions for tutorials/downloads to be mentioned I’m sure Pure would love to hear them. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

When we had that other home page crap (I forget the name of it) I liked when John (Flame_) was posting about the recent servers and learning a bit about some of the more “higher up” community members.</p>
<p>Perhaps it could include <span class="bbcode-u">constant</span> section on the Official server, giving it’s latest patches and updates; to show people it’s active and maybe get some more interest in that… Posting some other ‘trending’ server development topics would give some users extra recognition as well.[/quote]I can continue the interviewing of senior members. As tom said make sure you post stuff you want to see in the next weekly update as a reply to this thread and they will be considered. I’ll also talk to sinisoul regarding updates about the server but I doubt consistent progress is made every week on it, it’s exam season after all <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>edit: Feel free to brainstorm ideas about what to ask these senior community members, I’ll be sure to get around to it for next weeks update. A proper format will be worked on before a continuation of this series.<br>
i.e. a little about themselves now, what they are known for, what do they do nowadays, how did they find the community, etc</p>

Some of you have be aware that recently the IRC server was hit by a string of DDOS attacks. This has been the reason for any downtime/connection issues experienced.<br>
This has led to a host migration and t4 is now responsible for the server. We now have two nodes with one in Europe and one in America which is set to launch soon.</p>

Dan recently posted a comprehensive copy+paste style tutorial on how to add fully functional clan chats to the Hyperion base. He covers both the client and server aspects of the feature. All topped off with a video of the final product which looks amazing!</p>

This is an awesome contribution which features 20,000+ item definitions for the popular Asteria base, alongside how to implement it.</p>

Sini has recently began rewriting the RuneTek 4 engine for use in the offcial private server. Make sure you keep up with his progress!</p>

James is back with another emulation of the current RuneScape protocol. Although not complete, it has quite a bit of basic functionality and should serve as a good base for those wanting to dabble in this protocol.</p>
