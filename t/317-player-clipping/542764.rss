    <title>[317] Player clipping</title>

    <description>Base: Delta

How do I implement player clipping? If player clipping is in my source already, what are the method&#39;s? What are known method&#39;s for player clipping? I&#39;ve got npc clipping working (finally). But as far as player clipping, when following a player-he walks through objects, when lighting a fire-he walks through objects. How do I prevent it?</description>
