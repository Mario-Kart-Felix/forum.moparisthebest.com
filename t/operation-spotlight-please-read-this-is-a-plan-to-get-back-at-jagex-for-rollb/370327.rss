    <title>Operation: Spotlight (PLEASE READ. THIS IS A PLAN TO GET BACK AT JAGEX FOR ROLLB</title>

    <description>Have an account that had a stat or many stats reduced for no reason whatsoever? Join the club. MANY players have experienced a loss of experience points in stats having them reset to arbitrary levels. Jagex is trying VERY hard to keep this situation out of the spotlight by hiding any and every new topic they encounter about the stat reduction on the forums. This is where you can play your part in bringing this situation out to the public eye. Take your accounts and make threads on the Account Help, Tech Support, Skills, General, Recent Updates, Future Updates, Constructive Criticism, and Rants forums regarding this stat reduction and watch how your thread gets HIDDEN. The more players we get making threads the more threads get hidden and the obvious fact that Jagex is trying to hide this becomes even more obvious. Jagex will have to make a public statement about the reductions with enough hidden threads.

Please play your part. Post on this thread with your opinion on the idea and begin posting on the Runescape forums ASAP. Your participation will help botters and legitimate players alike.

Jagex is the only one losing here.</description>
