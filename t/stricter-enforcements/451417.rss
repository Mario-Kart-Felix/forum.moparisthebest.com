    <title>Stricter enforcements</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stricter-enforcements/451417</link>
    <description>Over the past couple of years I have been on the forums I have noticed a general decline of the users spelling. A  global rule which has been in play for longer than I have been here has been using proper spelling. 

I believe this should become a stricter requirement. While I can see the need for leniency. It&#39;s used a lot of times to try to get people to look at a topic etc. 

A few specifically are normally in client and server help. 

What type of punishment should be given? 

-first time = small warning
-second time = small in between middle warning
-third time = medium warning
-fourth time = temp mute for 48 hours
-fifth time = complete muting</description>

<p>I can understand 100% if English is a secondary language and etc. It’s another when it’s intentional. I see all the time though stuff like “z0mg h3lp m3, m3 n00b n33ed developper” etc. Just gets irritating you know?</p>

<p>I don’t particularly like that rule to be honest. I think moderators have more pressing issues to deal with rather than become the spelling-police. We’re always going to get members who can’t spell properly, whether it be due to their age or nationality. It’s extremely harsh if we were to enforce this upon users with which english is not their national language. Posting this from my phone, so forgive any mistakes.</p>

</aside>
<p>This. We shouldn’t have to force people to spell correctly, we simply expect them to try their best to seem intelligible when posting.</p>
