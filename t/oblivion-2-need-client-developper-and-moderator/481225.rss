    <description>[size=36pt]Oblivion 2, where your dream story comes true!
[/size]

[size=14pt]Hello everyone,

Introduction

Maybe you have seen oblivion 2 (partnership with froyoscape) in the development board.
Our project is making good process but the only thing missing is a decent client.
So we are still looking for one client sided programmer. 
Make sure u can show atleast something of urself otherwise your chances of becomming the client programmmer drops to 0%.

[size=18pt]Oblivion 2: the storyline.[/size]

You start in a jail because you did something terribles but the problem is that you can&#39;t even remember it and the guard doesn&#39;t want to tell you it aswell. But then out of nowher old duke appears next to your cel door and tell the guard he must take you with him! The guard doesn&#39;t agree with that and they both die on a unexplained way. After that you must find yourself a way out of the manhole. When you get out duke stays right in front of you 100% alive. He didn&#39;t died for real but just used some loveed up magic cast to get away. Now you can start for da real job. After chosen your starter package you will be teleported to a random city in runescape. The problem is: you can&#39;t leave the city! Or you have to pay a big amount of money. You are sad because you want to go out and really enjoy the adventure! So you search for help by Hans. He will help you after you get lose friends with him. He will expain you that there is another way. The city keeper of lumbridge and any other city keeper let people through that gate when they did an hard job for the city. You will get a special note so the guards will let you pass. Now after this you start remembering why you were in jail and what Duke really needed from you and every time u do a quest u get closer to the answer!

              <p>[size=36pt]Oblivion 2, where your dream story comes true!<br>
[/size]</p>
<p>[size=14pt]Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Maybe you have seen oblivion 2 (partnership with froyoscape) in the development board.<br>
Our project is making good process but the only thing missing is a decent client.<br>
So we are still looking for one client sided programmer.<br>
Make sure u can show atleast something of urself otherwise your chances of becomming the client programmmer drops to 0%.<br>

[size=18pt]Oblivion 2: the storyline.[/size]</p>
<p>You start in a jail because you did something terribles but the problem is that you can’t even remember it and the guard doesn’t want to tell you it aswell. But then out of nowher old duke appears next to your cel door and tell the guard he must take you with him! The guard doesn’t agree with that and they both die on a unexplained way. After that you must find yourself a way out of the manhole. When you get out duke stays right in front of you 100% alive. He didn’t died for real but just used some loveed up magic cast to get away. Now you can start for da real job. After chosen your starter package you will be teleported to a random city in runescape. The problem is: you can’t leave the city! Or you have to pay a big amount of money. You are sad because you want to go out and really enjoy the adventure! So you search for help by Hans. He will help you after you get lose friends with him. He will expain you that there is another way. The city keeper of lumbridge and any other city keeper let people through that gate when they did an hard job for the city. You will get a special note so the guards will let you pass. Now after this you start remembering why you were in jail and what Duke really needed from you and every time u do a quest u get closer to the answer!</p>
