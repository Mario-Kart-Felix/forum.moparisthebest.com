    <description>Hello, I was wondering if there was anybody who could help me find a way to update the MoparScape client that you download and install. I do not like the version it comes with default. I do not remember the version name but I know runekeep used to use the same one. I don&#39;t like it and I would like to make my own private server for just me to play on but I would like to update it to old school Runescape or something like that. 
If not possible, I would be happy to work on your server as an admin or staff.

Thanks.
