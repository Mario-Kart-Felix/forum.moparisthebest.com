    <title>Could use some advise regarding source + client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/could-use-some-advise-regarding-source-client/549946</link>
    <description>hey guys, i was searching this site for some days now and i can&#39;t really find a source+client revision 317-530 that has skills working
(especially mining, smithing, fletching and crafting) aswell as easy to change xp-rates, since i would love to have the original rates,
so i wanted to ask straight forward, does anyone know a source+client that would fit into that criteria?
(please keep in mind that i&#39;m no java programmer, i can edit some values when they&#39;re tagged so i know what they change but not much more) =(</description>
