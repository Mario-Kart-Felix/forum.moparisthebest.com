    <title>[Req]Changing Hd char models to 317 chars[Req]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-changing-hd-char-models-to-317-chars-req/547627</link>
    <description>As the title says it all, I am looking for someone who can help me with this. We can discuss more details through Skype if your interested. 
You guys may say &quot;Look around there are models roaming around&quot; but understand that I have. I been looking for a few days here and there and could not find any. Like I said before if you need more details we can discuss it over Skype. Your time won&#39;t be wasted.
I currently have these character models
