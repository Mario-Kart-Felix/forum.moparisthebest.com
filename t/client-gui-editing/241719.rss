    <description>I&#39;ve googled and searched all over but can&#39;t find anything about this.  I&#39;ve just started coding clients today and i&#39;m trying to find out what i can do and how.  I&#39;ve messed up plenty but fixed all the errors and figured out how to do many things through trial and error but now i&#39;m stuck trying to move the chatbox.  I&#39;ve tried to edit the sprites and make the chat box bigger and the surrounding sprites smaller, i was accurate down to the pixel but was just left with empty space between them.  I tried to manually set the grab pixel arguments in Class30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub1 (Seemingly where the interface is set up in my client).  Now what i&#39;m wondering is how do i determine how big a sprite is and where it&#39;s put on the interface?  I&#39;ve never taken java lessons and i&#39;m pretty new to it so be gentle ^^.</description>

              <p>What exactly do you mean by that?  When i delete part the surrounding sprites they just move in closer to the chat box and leave a blank space where they should be and the chat doesn’t change at all.  How would i change where the sprites are kept on the interface?</p>
