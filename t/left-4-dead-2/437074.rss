    <title>Left 4 Dead 2</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/left-4-dead-2/437074</link>
    <description>Anyone out there who wants to shake the dust off this game and play with a couple friends and I tonight? We play pretty competively, so keep moving or you&#39;re probably going to get left behind (meaning don&#39;t stick back just because you saw a Jockey and a Smoker and want to kill them, let them chase you and if you get caught we&#39;ll turn around and save you. Don&#39;t stand around and waste time). We&#39;ll be playing Versus mainly, maybe switching to Scavenge, Survival, or the Four Swordsmen Mutation throughout the night.

I can offer some tips or answer questions if anyone needs them.

We&#39;ll start playing around 6 or 7 P.M. (Central time). I should have a friend or two joining already so just send me a message or post if you wanna join in. Probably playing through at least two campaigns.

Oh and just for some extra info new DLC is coming out soon :)

A few tips when playing with us:

[ul][li]Unless you can 100% crown the Witch, don&#39;t shoot it.[/li]
[li]If you find an area with multiple pipe bombs/molotovs, call it out and aid the others in retrieving them.[/li]
[li]Grab a shotgun on common Tank stages. Save your molotov on these stages as well.[/li]
[li]Don&#39;t shoot a Boomer unless he is far enough away or you have to.[/li]
[li]Use the melee button on Smokers, Hunters, and Jockeys attacking the Survivors to get them off, then keep doing it and shooting until they are dead.[/li][/ul]</description>

<p>Then you haven’t played it enough. Yes the game has it’s physics errors, such as a Charger clearly hitting a Survivor but it registers as not hitting them. But you’d be surprised about the strategy required in this game to do well on a Versus match.</p>
