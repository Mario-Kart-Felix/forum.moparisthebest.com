    <title>Can 2 people connect on the same ip address using the local host?</title>

    <description>Hey,

Okay; This is going to sound really stupid. But me and a friend are working on a new project &amp; either I&#39;m at his house or he&#39;s at mine.. But we was wondering if we both could connect to the local host (127.0.0.1) AND both of us log on. 
We came to this conclusion because if were both using the same connection we should both be able to connect right?
Well were going to try it out later.
Post telling us if it won&#39;t work (Save us from wasting our time :P)
Thanks a lot,
Microfire.</description>
