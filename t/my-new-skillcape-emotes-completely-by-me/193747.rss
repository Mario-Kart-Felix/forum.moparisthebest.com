    <title>My new SkillCape emotes. Completely by Me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-new-skillcape-emotes-completely-by-me/193747</link>
    <description> Thats correct. I&#39;ve been working on a server lately and these are some of the skillcape emotes I&#39;ve finished. I only have 1 left to do.
These are just a few of them I&#39;m using as examples. I&#39;ll get around to adding more later. Thanks.

Please note: These are NOT RS emotes. These were designed by me, not them. The wording are automatic with skillcape emotes.

My Favorite One ;) FiremakingCape

I understand that these are .avi formats. I&#39;m not sure of the extension that I&#39;d need to create a moving image. Sorry. If anyone can help me with that, it would be much appreciated.
