    <description>Okay so I am wanting to change the name, combat, and examine information for npcs, and the name and examine information for items. If anyone has tools for the 474 revision that would allow me to do this I would greatly appreciate those

HOWEVER I am willing to hardcode these as a temporary fix if someone can tell me how to hardcode them on a 474 client I&#39;ve been searching for the past 5 hours and can&#39;t find a single thing on how to do this.</description>
