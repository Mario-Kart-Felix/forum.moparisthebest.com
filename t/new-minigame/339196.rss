    <title>New minigame</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-minigame/339196</link>
    <description>[b]So I want it to show the name of the minigame I made, in the pop up it shows when you click &quot;MiniGames Teleport&quot; (This is Delta)..
I kept trying to do it, I compiled, and it would show an error.. like 100 errors..
What am I supposed to do?
I know how to make a minigame, I just don&#39;t know how to put it in the pop up and I also would like to show a picture of the MiniGame, not exactly like the minigame, just the best thing that it drops..[/b]</description>
