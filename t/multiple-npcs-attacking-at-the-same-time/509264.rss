    <title>Multiple NPC&#39;s attacking at the same time</title>

    <description>Hey reader

I currently have a little problem finding out what causes my problem. I have a few NPC&#39;s spawned by a minigame and they all load well and they do want to attack me, but once there is 1 of them attacking me, they all stop walking towards me in order to attack me. Even if I run past them, they won&#39;t do anything. I know it&#39;s probably in NPCHandler (maybe even in the void AttackPlayer method).</description>
