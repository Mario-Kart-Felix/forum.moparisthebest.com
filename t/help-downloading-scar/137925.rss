    <title>Help downloading SCAR</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-downloading-scar/137925</link>
    <description>Well, I have had scar for quite a while now, so i decided to look at some scripts.  To my surprise i couldn&#39;t open them :eek: .  I go to my scar folder and I double click scar and I get an error message saying scar has been deleted.  I try to uninstall scar, but it says its still running(wtf).  I only have one account on this computer, scar ISN&#39;T running and I cant install scar because its still installed.  Help would be thanked but i cant rep you.
EDIT: i know about that one program with boot in its name, is there anything else I can do without downloading things?</description>

              <p>well i used search for scar and nothing, and i looked through all the tabs on the task manager and could not find scar.  Deleting the folder didn’t help either.  I have vista if that helps anybody out there.  Before this happened my avg said scar was a trojan (it isnt I downloaded it right off dylock).  It kept on asking me to delete it and I never did.  Does any of this help?</p>

              <p>Wow, That’s a hard one…<br>
Only thing I can think of is to check Task Manager for an Instance of scar.exe and end it,<br>
Then trying to uninstall it again,<br>
Or install if again into a different directory.</p>
<p>Try deleting the folder you installed SCAR into, then Uninstalling via Add\Remove programs in Control Panel.</p>
