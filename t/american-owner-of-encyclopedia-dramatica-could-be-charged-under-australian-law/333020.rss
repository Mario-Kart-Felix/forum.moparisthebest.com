    <title>American owner of Encyclopedia Dramatica could be charged under Australian Law</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/american-owner-of-encyclopedia-dramatica-could-be-charged-under-australian-law/333020</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]The US-based owner of a satirical Wikipedia-style website may be charged under Australian law over a deliberately offensive article about Aborigines.[/b]

The Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission (HREOC) contacted Encyclopedia Dramatica owner Joseph Evers, after 20 indigenous Australians complained about the article&#39;s content.

Earlier this year the same article — which includes numerous offensive depictions of Aborigines — was removed from Google&#39;s search listings after a request from the Human Rights Commission.

The article has remained on the Encyclopedia Dramatica website.

Joseph Evers, the owner of Encyclopedia Dramatica, published the first page of an email from HREOC on his website&#39;s blog today.

&quot;This is an initial investigation into charging me, personally, with the violation of Australia’s Racial Discrimination Act,&quot; Evers wrote.

Although Evers lives in the US, the email cites a previous court case in which a US company was charged under Australian law.

&quot;While I act in complete compliance with both the civil and criminal codes of the United States of America, and am assured the right of free speech according to our constitution … I can personally be jailed and fined for the violation of this law.&quot;

Evers stressed in his latest blog post that he would not be removing the article.

&quot;Encyclopedia Dramatica will never be censored in any way,&quot; he said.

Encyclopedia Dramatica is a satirical website that often goes to extreme lengths to shock readers.

In addition to the Aboriginal article, there are several other pieces — including one lampooning the death of Bundaberg girl Trinity Bates — that have been criticised in the past.

ninemsn recently interviewed one of the site&#39;s top moderators, who defended the site, saying &quot;it is the only collaborative publishing platform on the internet that allows completely free speech.&quot;

When asked whether the article &quot;Aboriginal&quot; was written by racist bullies, the moderator — who did not want to be named — said that he believed the article to be a comedy piece.

&quot;Bullying is when someone gets beaten. Satire is when an article gets written on an Internet comedy website,&quot; he said.

Encyclopedia Dramatica is believed to be one of the websites that will be banned in Australia under upcoming internet filtering legislation.

The online community Anonymous, which is responsible for several hacking attacks against government websites in protest of the proposed filter, is strongly associated with Encyclopedia Dramatica.

The email from the Human Rights Commission to Evers cites a 2002 court case in which an Australian businessman was able to sue a US company for defamation over an article published online.

Dow Jones &amp; Co Inc ended up paying the defendant, mining entrepreneur Joseph Gutnick, $580,000 in fees and damages.

Evers wrote that he had been advised never to return to Australia.

&quot;My counsel has advised me that I can never under any circumstances visit my family in Sydney again, nor otherwise make any appearances on Australian soil,&quot; he wrote.

&quot;Here&#39;s to the hidden cost of freedom.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#39;t know who the fuck our government bodies think they are, but this strikes me as outrageous.</description>

              <p>So Australia has this law make it illegal to be racist towards Aborigines and we all agree on the truth, beauty and justice of it. But then one person stands up and says “You know what, all this stuff about Aborigines, I’m not convinced!” “I think the government gives them too much money” “I think they’re culture is harmful and not to be respected”.<br>
That person doesn’t just have a right to speak, that persons speech must be given extra protection. Why? because what he said could possibly contain a small grain of truth and it also makes us reconsider our own positions. Its always worth going back to first principles. What would you do if you met a flat-earth society member? Come to think of it, how can I prove the Earth is round?<br>
Why do I think this is true other then that’s what I’ve always been taught and never known anything different? How sure am I of my own beliefs?<br>
Don’t take refuge in the false security of consensus and that feeling of whatever you think you’re bound to be okay because everyone else thinks it too.</p>
<p>Its not just the right of the speaker to be heard, it is the right of everyone else to hear him. Every time you silence someone to make yourself a prisoner to your own actions because you deny yourself the right to hear something. In other words, your own right to hear and be exposed is as much involved in these cases as is the right of the speaker to voice his view.</p>
<p>Freedom is speech is <span class="bbcode-b">meaningless</span> unless it means the freedom of the one who thinks <span class="bbcode-i">differently</span>.</p>
<p>Shame on you Australians, you’ve giving up one of the things which are most precious. You’re giving them up without a fight and even praising those who take it away from you.</p>
<p>[size=6pt]Yes I know that almost nobody on these forums voted for that party and doesn’t support these laws, but I’m speaking to the Australians as whole nation.[/size]</p>

          <blockquote>
              <blockquote>[b]The US-based owner of a satirical Wikipedia-style website may be charged under Australian law over a deliberately offensive article about Aborigines.[/b]
<p>The Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission (HREOC) contacted Encyclopedia Dramatica owner Joseph Evers, after 20 indigenous Australians complained about the article’s content.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the same article — which includes numerous offensive depictions of Aborigines — was removed from Google’s search listings after a request from the Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>The article has remained on the Encyclopedia Dramatica website.</p>
<p>Joseph Evers, the owner of Encyclopedia Dramatica, published the first page of an email from HREOC on his website’s blog today.</p>
<p>“This is an initial investigation into charging me, personally, with the violation of Australia’s Racial Discrimination Act,” Evers wrote.</p>
<p>Although Evers lives in the US, the email cites a previous court case in which a US company was charged under Australian law.</p>
<p>“While I act in complete compliance with both the civil and criminal codes of the United States of America, and am assured the right of free speech according to our constitution … I can personally be jailed and fined for the violation of this law.”</p>
<p>Evers stressed in his latest blog post that he would not be removing the article.</p>
<p>“Encyclopedia Dramatica will never be censored in any way,” he said.</p>
<p>Encyclopedia Dramatica is a satirical website that often goes to extreme lengths to shock readers.</p>
<p>In addition to the Aboriginal article, there are several other pieces — including one lampooning the death of Bundaberg girl Trinity Bates — that have been criticised in the past.</p>
<p>ninemsn recently interviewed one of the site’s top moderators, who defended the site, saying “it is the only collaborative publishing platform on the internet that allows completely free speech.”</p>
<p>When asked whether the article “Aboriginal” was written by racist bullies, the moderator — who did not want to be named — said that he believed the article to be a comedy piece.</p>
<p>“Bullying is when someone gets beaten. Satire is when an article gets written on an Internet comedy website,” he said.</p>
<p>Encyclopedia Dramatica is believed to be one of the websites that will be banned in Australia under upcoming internet filtering legislation.</p>
<p>The online community Anonymous, which is responsible for several hacking attacks against government websites in protest of the proposed filter, is strongly associated with Encyclopedia Dramatica.</p>
<p>The email from the Human Rights Commission to Evers cites a 2002 court case in which an Australian businessman was able to sue a US company for defamation over an article published online.</p>
<p>Dow Jones &amp; Co Inc ended up paying the defendant, mining entrepreneur Joseph Gutnick, $580,000 in fees and damages.</p>
<p>Evers wrote that he had been advised never to return to Australia.</p>
<p>“My counsel has advised me that I can never under any circumstances visit my family in Sydney again, nor otherwise make any appearances on Australian soil,” he wrote.</p>
<p>“Here’s to the hidden cost of freedom.”</p>
