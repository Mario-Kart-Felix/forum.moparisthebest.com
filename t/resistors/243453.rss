     50ΩB 100Ω A
in this circuit ═ is a resistor
We are measuring the voltage across the points AB
In this current model the answer will be 4 as the first resistor is 100Ω which is 2/3 of the total resistance meaning it has 2/3 of the total voltage across it. Ok Now lets say i add another resistor between the 50Ω resistor and the battery, now the answer of the voltage across A B is 2.4 As 100Ω has now becaume 2/5 of the overall resistace so it gets 2/5 of the total voltage. Now if i add another 100Ω resistor(to the base model above not the 250Ω model i just stated) but this time in parrelel to the first 100Ω resistor what is the voltage across the points AB? In a parralel circuit the voltage is a constant whereas in a series circuit current is the constant and voltage varies(as we have seen) So what is the answer?</description>

              <p>how do you get to that answer? Have you based it off of the original query of the 2/3 to 1/3? I suppose that might be right if current were the variable and it doubled throughout two wires the voltage wouldnt spilt between 5 so it might be right[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 24, 2008, 10:18:16[/size][hr]the answer was infact 3. you do the conductance (reciprocal of the resistance) so 1/100 + 1/100= 0.02 then the reciprocal of that which is 50. Then you use 50 Ohms as the resistance for said object and then compared with the other 50 they both get half the voltage</p>

<p>Rewrite the question, use a dataline and draw a new circuit diagram with the voltmeter and new resistor on. Then you’ll be able to make sense of it.</p>

</aside>
<p>there is no voltmeter is about using forumlae to work out the voltage and i know what the forumla looks like i can picture it perfectly in my head but i dont know how to work out voltage across a parrelel circuit? nomsain</p>

              <p>thats just background information surrounding the question, the question i have in mind is like part d the rest is parts A to C etc but if its 2v then there would be 4v on the 50Ω resistor</p>
