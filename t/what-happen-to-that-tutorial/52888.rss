    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-happen-to-that-tutorial/52888</link>
    <description>Does any one know what happen to that one tutorial that tells you how to set up the compiler? I&#39;ve searched , cant find it so don&#39;t tell me that. If any one has the link to it it would be nice.

I used to have it set up but I had to reformat my computer and I lost the topic on how to do it .. so if any one has it please post it.</description>
