    <title>Values larger than bytes being written as bytes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/values-larger-than-bytes-being-written-as-bytes/20465</link>
    <description>I&#39;m making an encryption algorithm that takes any string and turns it into an int. This int is always over the value of a byte, for example 2063597632. I&#39;m taking this int and xoring (^) it with each induvidual byte read from a file. Finally, I&#39;m writing that byte back to the file. I was wondering how Java computes that int so it can be stored to the file as a byte? Thanks.[br][size=1]Posted at: October 28, 2006, 09:53:07 AM[/size][hr]And I don&#39;t really want to use writeInt instead of writeByte, because it makes the encrypted file 4 times bigger :(.</description>

<p>Can you please show us the code “that takes any string and turns it into an int”?</p>
<p>Because, well… An ascii string is length * 8 bits long, and a Java int 32 bits long.<br>
Therefore it is <em>impossible</em> to store a string that is over 4 ascii characters in length into an int so that it could be later retrieved.</p>
<p>Unless of course you’re making it a one-way hash, hence the word “one-way”, cannot be reversed.</p>
<p>Example of a sucky one:</p>
<p><code>  public final static int hash(String s) {
    int i = 0xaaaaaaaa;
    for(byte b : s.getBytes())
      i = (i ^ b) &lt;&lt; 3;
    return i;
  }

              <p>I’m making an encryption algorithm that takes any string and turns it into an int. This int is always over the value of a byte, for example 2063597632. I’m taking this int and xoring (^) it with each induvidual byte read from a file. Finally, I’m writing that byte back to the file. I was wondering how Java computes that int so it can be stored to the file as a byte? Thanks.[br][size=1]Posted at: October 28, 2006, 09:53:07 AM[/size][hr]And I don’t really want to use writeInt instead of writeByte, because it makes the encrypted file 4 times bigger :(.</p>
