    <description>Dandelion seed

Remorseful feelings are due to you,
because you have been entrusted much ado.
Why is it that you’re looked upon with such glee?
It is assumed that you feel sympathy.
You hear more than enough from one’s mind,
I wonder how you are able to confine.
When all the torment has been said and told,
You are swept from your family into the cold.
The wind twists and twirls you around,
but all you can hear is the mind’s sorrow sounds.
You stumble through the air, trying to find your way,
but the sorrow brings you to dismay.
The sorrows of one&#39;s mind cannot comprehend,
and all is lost in an unfortunate end.</description>
