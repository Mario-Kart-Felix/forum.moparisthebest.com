    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-big-question-on-667s-read-here/440926</link>
    <description>My friend is currently trying to host a 667. He has portforwarded etc, because i can get on it.

But how come You need java 7 to run it? or else it will say .loader cant be found..


I dont understand how people can play matrix with lower java? Im utterly confused , please
help me...


I Can log on his server fine, But a few other people cannot, is it the protocal in loader.java
or what am i doing wrong...?</description>
