              <p>Search <span class="bbcode-b">hash</span> in client.java, press enter 2 times, you’ll find something that looks like this <code>String hashPW = md5(playerPass);
playerPass = hashPW;</code> Delete that, save, compile, should work, only downpart is you’ll have to change all the encrypted passwords to the passwords they use 2 logg in</p>
