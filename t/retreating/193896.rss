    <description>Look im not going to beat around the bush. I want something like rsc pking on my rs2 server. (on my server i got new updated items and stuff) so it will be leet.

I dont know how to go about putting in the &#39;mob attacker&#39; or the attack logger so you cant retreat before 3 rounds.


I have everything else done (eating and 1v1 no teaming)</description>
