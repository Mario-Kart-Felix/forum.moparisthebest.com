[code=java]int a1 = c.getInStream().readSignedWordBigEndian();
		int itemUsed = c.getInStream().readSignedWordA();
		int groundItem = c.getInStream().readUnsignedWord();
		int gItemY = c.getInStream().readSignedWordA();
		int itemUsedSlot = c.getInStream().readSignedWordBigEndianA();
		int gItemX = c.getInStream().readUnsignedWord();[/code]</description>
