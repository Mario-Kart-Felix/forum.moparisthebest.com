    <title>Adding a spec (like ruby bolt) that uses it randomly on a wep with no arrow (PI)</title>

    <description>ok basicly what i need because i made d bolts too OP, which is quite good, and i need a melee weapon that uses the &quot;spec&quot; or whatever you should call it, like ruby bolts code is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;if (Misc.random(4) == 1 &amp;&amp; c.lastArrowUsed == 9242 &amp;&amp; damage &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon] == 9185) {
					Server.npcHandler.npcs[i].gfx0(754);
					damage = Server.npcHandler.npcs[i].HP/5;
					//c.handleHitMask(c.playerLevel[3]/10);
					c.dealDamage(c.playerLevel[3]/10);
					c.gfx0(754);					
				}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

as you see it says &lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;&amp; c.lastArrowUsed == 9242 &amp;&amp; damage &gt; 0&lt;/blockquote&gt;

i tried removing that and adding&lt;blockquote&gt;if (Misc.random(4) == 1 &amp;&amp; c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon] == 4718) {&lt;/blockquote&gt;
it did not use its &quot;spec&quot; and i tried &lt;blockquote&gt;if (Misc.random(4) == 1 &amp;&amp; damage &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon] == 4718) {&lt;/blockquote&gt; still nothing.

[size=18pt] help me please? thanks[/size]</description>

it did not use its “spec” and i tried <blockquote>if (Misc.random(4) == 1 &amp;&amp; damage &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon] == 4718) {</blockquote> still nothing.
