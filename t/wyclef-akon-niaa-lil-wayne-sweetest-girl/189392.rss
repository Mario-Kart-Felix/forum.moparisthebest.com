Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill
She wined for the bill
Grind for the bill
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill

High School she was
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she’s a 10)
High School she was
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she’s a 10)
Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She balls, He calls (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don’t get fed, go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in a rolled car, bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She thought he’d call (where my money at?)

See I’mma tell you like WU told me
Cash Rules everything around me
Singin’ dollar dollar bill yall (dollar, dollar bill yall)
Singin’ dollar dollar bill yall(dollar, dollar bill yall)
See I’mma tell you like WU told me
Cash Rules everything around me
Singin’ dollar dollar bill yall (dollar, dollar bill yall)
Singin’ dollar dollar bill yall (dollar, dollar bill yall)

Pimpin’ got harder cos, hoes got smarter
On the strip is something they don’t wanna be a part of’
Rather be up in the club shakin’ for a thug
For triple times the money and spending it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on my nines
See every day they feel the struggle, but they stay on their grind
And Aint Nobody take it from us, and that’s the bottom line
But I know there’s a drop in the block
You move slow
You getting’ pressure from cops
you don’t know,and not to lay low
coz 25 to life&#39;s no joke
[Sweetest Girl lyrics on http://www.metrolyrics.com]

To all my real gorillas thuggin’
On top of corners every day strugglin’
All the beautiful women getting’ money
Washin&#39; them dollar bills like laundry

See I’mma tell you like WU told me
Cash Rules everything around me
Singin’ dollar dollar bill yall (dollar, dollar bill yall)
Singin’ dollar dollar bill yall (dollar, dollar bill yall)
See I’mma tell you like WU told me
Cash Rules everything around me
Singin’ dollar dollar bill yall (dollar, dollar bill yall)
Singin’ dollar dollar bill yall (dollar, dollar bill yall)

Money, money-money-money
Money, money-money-money
It Drives The World Crazy, we’re crazy
She used to be (she used to be the sweetest girl)

She used to be the sweetest girl ever (ever)
Now she like Sour Ammaretto
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks off the track right by school
She takes a loss cos she don’t wanna see her child lose
So respect her, or pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him… Where the money at

See I’mma tell you like WU told me
Cash Rules everything around me
Singin’ dollar dollar bill yall (dollar, dollar bill yall)
Singin’ dollar dollar bill yall (dollar, dollar bill yall)
See I’mma tell you like WU told me
Cash Rules everything around me
Singin’ dollar dollar bill yall (dollar, dollar bill yall)
Singin’ dollar dollar bill yall (dollar, dollar bill yall)
Some live for the bill

Where my money at?
