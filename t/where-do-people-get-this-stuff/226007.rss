              <p>acually they can’t find it 2 ways…</p>
<p>1.Hard Way (Searching That Type Of Model)<br>
They would create a command and then use it until they found that type they are looking for.</p>
<p>2.Easy Way(Dumping That Type Of Model Data)<br>
They make a method that dumps all the data of the client to a file while it loads</p>
<p>i use the 2nd way because its funnier,Thats how i found some of the contruction objects in the 377 client <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
