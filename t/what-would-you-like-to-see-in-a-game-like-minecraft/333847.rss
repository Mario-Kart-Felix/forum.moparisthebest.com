    <description>I wasn&#39;t even aware of [url=http://minecraft.net/]minecraft[/url] until yesterday (thanks sppt :)), but it&#39;s a neat idea with some potential, I just think it needs a lot of work.  It&#39;s something I think I would like to turn into a project and work on actively.  I believe I would go with java for the language, because I like the idea of a web applet.  (although I would allow full screen and such)  But here is a list of things I am considering supporting (in addition to what minecraft currently supports):


[ol][li]Different shapes, such as cones, prisms, cylinders etc.[/li]
[li]Instead of building one block at a time, you could build a structure with multiple blocks, and then save it to build it later (possibly re-oriented, this would make building stairs or buildings much easier, for example for a 4-sided building you would only have to build 1 side and then use it 3 more times)[/li]
[li]I don&#39;t believe bigger maps would be a problem, along with some other scenery in the distance perhaps.[/li]
[li]Better graphics, a little more detail wouldn&#39;t kill anyone.  Current minecraft looks like it was built in 1989, not 2009.[/li]
[li]Minimap[/li]
[li]Plugin support for more block types[/li]
[li]Always free to play[/li]
[li][b]You suggest more for here...[/b][/li][/ol]</description>

No thanks.<br>
Minecraft is supposed to be without a minimap, and that’s that.<br>
Implementing a minimap is kinda like implementing an aimbot in a shooter imo, you just don’t do it.</p>

<p>Well, I don’t mean a minimap where you could view the entire map at once, just the area near you that you could pretty much already see.  Think runescape minimap.  What about that?</p>

              <p>I wasn’t even aware of <a href="http://minecraft.net/" data-bbcode="true">minecraft</a> until yesterday (thanks sppt :)), but it’s a neat idea with some potential, I just think it needs a lot of work.  It’s something I think I would like to turn into a project and work on actively.  I believe I would go with java for the language, because I like the idea of a web applet.  (although I would allow full screen and such)  But here is a list of things I am considering supporting (in addition to what minecraft currently supports):</p>
<p>[ol][li]Different shapes, such as cones, prisms, cylinders etc.[/li]<br>
[li]Instead of building one block at a time, you could build a structure with multiple blocks, and then save it to build it later (possibly re-oriented, this would make building stairs or buildings much easier, for example for a 4-sided building you would only have to build 1 side and then use it 3 more times)[/li]<br>
[li]I don’t believe bigger maps would be a problem, along with some other scenery in the distance perhaps.[/li]<br>
[li]Better graphics, a little more detail wouldn’t kill anyone.  Current minecraft looks like it was built in 1989, not 2009.[/li]<br>
[li]Minimap[/li]<br>
[li]Plugin support for more block types[/li]<br>
[li]Always free to play[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">You suggest more for here…</span>[/li][/ol]</p>
