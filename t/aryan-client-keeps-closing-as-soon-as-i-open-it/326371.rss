    <title>Aryan client keeps closing as soon as i open it</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/aryan-client-keeps-closing-as-soon-as-i-open-it/326371</link>
    <description>I apologise in advance if this is in the wrong place.

I have downloaded the Aryan Moparscape Client but when i try to open it it just keep closing on itself, i have downloaded Java SE Development Kit 6u18 I think it is and Winrar but it still doesn&#39;t open... can anybody help?

Edit: I havent used Moparscape in about 10 months and I have forgot everything i ever knew about this, hence why i&#39;m asking a reasonably simple question, anyway, could you answer my question in noob language and go through, in detail, where I will find things ect.

Thank you :D

Please close, problem solved (Y)</description>
