    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/601-614-client-with-cache/358819</link>
    <description>Well.... recently i noticed i&#39;m a fricken failure at putting my Cache in my C:/ or w/e...

So i was wondering if anyone has a client that has the Cache in it, so i don&#39;t have to Extract it to C/: or C:/
