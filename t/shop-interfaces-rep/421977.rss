<p>No problem. My server suite has many tools that will make operating a server much easier. One such example is implementing SUIT (my interface library) with XML to produce something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="interface.css"?&gt;
&lt;interface id="3233"&gt;
    &lt;frame id="inventory"&gt;
        &lt;scrollpane&gt;
            &lt;itemtable width="4" length="7" /&gt;
        &lt;/scrollpane&gt;
    &lt;/frame&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">frame {
    visible: false;
}

#inventory {
    background: url("img/frame/background.jpg");
    visible: true;
}</code></pre>
