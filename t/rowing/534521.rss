    <title>Rowing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rowing/534521</link>
    <description>I was just wondering if anyone here had ever rowed before? Last semester I rowed crew for my college and it was one of the most challenging and rewarding things I&#39;ve ever done in my life. At times it was so painful that it bordered on torture and I just wished to be struck dead in the boat, but we won our race against another college during a regatta and it is one of my biggest accomplishments. It also looks amazing on you resume, being such a team oriented sport.</description>

              <p>Yeah definitely. You create such good friendships with your crew because you suffer together which enforces amazing synchronisation when we rowed. That picture was taken during training one morning as the sun was rising. I don’t miss waking up at 4AM in Winter haha.</p>

              <p>I don’t know a whole lot about the sport. I know I have heard in the past it takes immense teamwork and that if teamwork isn’t synced that you won’t go anywhere ( or at least not far )</p>
