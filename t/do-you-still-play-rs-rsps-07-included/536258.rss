<p>I guess people don’t like change too much. Personally, I liked the SOF… lol. It was like a lottery system, you could have been broke and spun the wheel and got like 200m and at one time im pretty sure I seen a BGS in the spin… could be wrong but im sure it was there.[/quote]<br>
A bgs? No. A “lucky” bgs, yes. There are quiet a few items they put on the sof that aren’t tradeable, actually most the rares are that.</p>

              <p>So I had a few free days to myself so I decided to try out divination. The skill it self is repetitive and sucks, but this lead me to try out some other aspects of the game. I did a slayer task using magic and actually found it fairly entertaining with the EOC updates.</p>
<p>I still have no fudgeing clue what is going on in the game in terms of these god wars and what weapons/armor are good or bad but its really not that bad.</p>

Just started back up on OSRS, finishing up with rune-crafting nature runes. t brings back awesome memories, and it’s better than playing these os remakes.</p>

              <p>I would love to get back into RS3 again, because I’m sure all of the updates would be exciting, but I’ve been cut off from the game since late 2011, which means I have a lot to catch up on (at least story-wise). I guess it would make a big difference if I had more time to play and if people I knew really well still played.</p>

              <p>I don’t play any anymore, but I just tried to sign into Rs3.  I can’t remember one of the passwords, but I’m guessing the previous owner recovered it.  And my other account was banned in April for goldfarming.  (Which I don’t even remember doing, and they have no evidence so idk).  Now all I have is this account that is pure f2p and kind of sucks.  It’s my first account from 2006 or 2007, but I’d rather have my accounts with 99s back.  ):</p>
