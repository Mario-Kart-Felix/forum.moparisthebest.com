    <title>Rep abuse</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rep-abuse/184479</link>
    <description>I would like to remind you guys that rep abuse will not be tolerated, and anyone found abusing their rep will have their rep reset to 0.

To make it clear on what rep abuse is, here is a little quote from the rules:
[sup]    Rep is a little reward for helping the community, it is not suppose to be given freely.[/sup]

Still confused? Spamming rep, giving &quot;free&quot; rep or giving rep for stupid messages could be considered as rep abuse.

[b][size=15pt]Just so you know, [/size][/b]admins have a nice little button that shows us all the rep that has been given and received, do not think we cannot see what rep was given and received.</description>
