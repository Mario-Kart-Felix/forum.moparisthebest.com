              <p>lets say i buy a painting. i hang it up on the wall so the house will look spiffy for an open house. a man walks by saying, “is this yours?” i say “yeah, isn’t it exquisite?”. the man replys “yes indeed it is”. have i claimed that i made the painting or have i claimed it’s mine?</p>
