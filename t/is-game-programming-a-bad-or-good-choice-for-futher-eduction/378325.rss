    <description>I don&#39;t actually need to decide this yet, but is game programmer a good profession?
I&#39;m thinking a bit about what to do with my future, so I don&#39;t need to get in a hurry next spring. From my view this moment, it sounds like a interesting choice and the salary is not bad either. So what are your opinions.

If not, what other programming related education/profession would be smart to choose.

And just another question, I did felt to make another tread about: What is good way to improve your vocal English, of course I could just search on Google, but any tip on some great resources/tricks? English is my second language if it wasn&#39;t apparently. My pronunciation is terrible, I can clearly hear my own errors, so just practice speaking would not be that effective, as you don&#39;t learn anything by repeating errors.


[b]Extra info:[/b]  The course I&#39;m considering does not limit myself to only game programming if that isn&#39;t the case with all education in this direction. But it would be a waste of money and time to choose something that won&#39;t give me a job, when I could save money and get a good job in another area, being a little country (Norway) it is not many schools to choose from.

[b]Extra question:[/b] 
What personal attributes are important for a game programmer?

I have for long had it in my head to make some games, and have already some ideas. So I will follow both your tips, regardless of what I choose in a year time.

              <p>Definetly what Chris said, just study and take a wide range of programming classes so that you have the most options when it the time finally comes to choose a job. As for English, the only way you will get better at speaking is by speaking. Your written grammar is really good, so you don’ t seem to have any problems with that. Good luck with your goals ;D</p>

              <p>In my opinion (and this is just my opinion, remember, I’m not a game developer) game development is a good choice of profession if you LOVE it. And I mean, LOVE it.</p>
<p>It pays a lot less than equivalently-skilled development positions in other industries, and it’s harder to get into, and often much harder work. But you get to work on cool games. Whether that makes up for it in your opinion is your choice.</p>
<p>As for the english problem, just speak to people a lot. There’s a website, <a href="http://www.lang-8.com">www.lang-8.com</a>, which hooks language learners up with native speakers for practice, in a tit-for-tat fashion (you correct me in English, I’ll correct you in my tongue etc.) It’s aimed more at the written word, but I’m pretty sure I remember quite a few people being up for skyping and stuff.</p>
<p>If not, just make a point of Skyping with more people instead of IM’ing them/email’ing, and make it clear that they should ruthlessly correct your pronunciation or mistakes. Most people don’t mind doing it, I’ve found, but they’re shy or embarassed or whatever of doing it without your permission, because they sound like a dick. If you make it clear that you want to improve they’ll gladly help.</p>

<p>I’d reccomend that you keep as many doors open to you as possible. If you want to go down the programming route, pick some course/profession that will encompas that, but also several other areas of computing. That way you can gain a more clear idea of what you really want to do.</p>
<p>Vocal English? Do you mean english isn’t your first language or your just not projecting your voice? Either way, practice!!</p>
<p>Just keep options open, but if game programming is a real passion and something you well and truly wish to do for a career, go for it!!!</p>
