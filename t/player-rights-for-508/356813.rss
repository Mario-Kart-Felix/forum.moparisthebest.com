    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-rights-for-508/356813</link>
    <description>Need help, I am trying to make it so that I am owner at Player rights = 3 and I have it all set when I log in it says the owner is me and that I have loged in, but I don&#39;t have a crown, what do I need to edit so that I can make me have a crown also?

I would prefer a silver crown :D. How could I edit it so I have a mod crown at pright = 3?</description>
