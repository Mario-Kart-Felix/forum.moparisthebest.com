Our community
Paradox637 has a very nice and friendly community that is always there to help you out. We strive for direct player reflecion, this means that players are the ones that help each other out. This creates the best gaming situation possible.


Management
First I&#39;d like to start off with telling you about how our management works, we strive for the bestgameplay for everyone - we care about what people say and we listen to them. Only because of this Paradox637 is so huge. You are what makes us big, without players we would be close to nowhere. Players are your friends, you just need to know how to handle them. Due to this big support of our players we have fully fixed up our wilderness, we gave them a great platform for clans to build off to improve clan community, we have a great system that does not allow Pjing or ragging in certain zones because - let&#39;s be honest, it pisses people off. But at the same time it improves the single clans to be more active. We are thinking of solutions, 24/7. That is what makes us #1 - We are ALWAYS ahead of the rest.

Ideal (What we strive for)
Our ideal is maximum entertainment. We are not in this business for the money, we are in this to give YOU the best entertainment. Your enjoyment of the game is what we strive for. You do not have to pay for anything because that simply goes against our ideal. Everything is free to enjoy! You have the option to purchase items, but you don&#39;t have to pay to wear specific items or to get privileges on other players!

That is how it&#39;s supposed to be, and that is how we do it.
