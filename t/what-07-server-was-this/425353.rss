              <p>Well, moparscape is just a client, and the client isn’t a buggy mess. The server, CrystalX, is the buggy mess.<br>
Why do you want to know what server this was? It sounds like it took a good hour to recreate it, using allstar as a base.</p>

              <p>Back when moparscape was a buggy mess, and the servers were laggy as hell I played in a server where you started out in Edgeville and there was 3 portals. You clicked an individual portal for strength, attack and defense exp.</p>
<p>I think the name was CrystalX or something like that. (not crisisx)</p>
<p>When you teleported to the house next to romeo and juliets house in Falador, there was lesser demons that you could kill.</p>
<p>I played it again in 2010. Now I forgot about it &gt;=\</p>
