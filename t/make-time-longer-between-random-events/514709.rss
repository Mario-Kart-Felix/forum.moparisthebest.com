    <title>Make time longer between random events</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-time-longer-between-random-events/514709</link>
    <description>Solved, I think. Haven&#39;t had an event yet so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s better now. :p

I&#39;m using the Rune-Evo source. The time between random events is too short for my liking and would like to change how often you get this random event. I&#39;ve tried searching through the Sandwichlady.java and sandwichladyhandler.java files, but can&#39;t find anything as far as changing the time between events. Also, I&#39;ve looked in the Magic.java files to see if there was a timed force teleporter time thing.. And don&#39;t see anything that would look like something that would track time till teleported to the random.

Some code i found in the player.java.. 


	@Override
	public void processReceivedHits() {
		if (lockDelay &gt; Utils.currentTimeMillis())
			return;
		super.processReceivedHits();
	}

	@Override
	public boolean needMasksUpdate() {
		return super.needMasksUpdate() || temporaryMovementType != -1
				|| updateMovementType;
	}
	public static void RandomEventTeleportPlayer(final Player player, final int x, final int y, final int z) {
		if (player.isLocked()
				|| player.getControlerManager().getControler() != null) {
		player.sm(&quot;You haven&#39;t teleported to random event for being busy.&quot;);
		}
		else {	
		player.setNextAnimation(new Animation(2140));
		player.setNextForceTalk(new ForceTalk(&quot;What is this?! Nooooo!!!!&quot;));
		player.lock();
	//	player.getControlerManager().startControler(&quot;RandomEvent&quot;);
		player.stopAll();
		WorldTasksManager.schedule(new WorldTask() {
			@Override
			public void run() {
				player.unlock();
				player.sm(&quot;You are teleported inside a random event.&quot;);
				player.setNextWorldTile(new WorldTile(x, y, z));
			}
		}, 5);
	}
	}
	public void randomevent(final Player p) {
        EventManager.getSingleton().addEvent(new Event() {
            public void execute(EventContainer c) {
                int r3 = 0;
                r3 = Utils.random(2);
                if (r3 == 0) {
                	if (isLocked()
            				|| getControlerManager().getControler() != null) {
                	sm(&quot;You was going to teleport too random event but you were too busy.&quot;);
                	}
                	else  {
                		 RandomEventTeleportPlayer(p, 1889, 5126, 0);
                	
                	}
                
		} else if (r3 == 1) {
	     	if (isLocked()
    				|| getControlerManager().getControler() != null) {
        	sm(&quot;You was going to teleport too random event but you were too busy.&quot;);
        	}
        	else  {
        		 RandomEventTeleportPlayer(p, 1889, 5126, 0);
        	
        	}
                }
            }
        }, 1800000);
    };

For some reason, I think it might have something to do with the &quot;1800000&quot; Perhaps that&#39;s how many milliseconds between events..?</description>

              <p>Sweet, even though I thought I figured it out… Which I did… It’s good to have confirmation. Thanks. I was getting annoyed with AFKing on the server to look things up and code things, etc… always came back in event and was annoying.
