              <p>What source is this even? PI? Delta? Shard? Hyperion? The hell man! Would help if u gave us a little more information.</p>
<p>And if you can’t change your home or add objects, I think you need to start looking up some guides on the search bar.</p>

              <p>Alright, first of all, when you make questions like this, post the type of code you are using<br>
Now i’ll get to attempting to help you<br>
To add stores/shops, you would go into your client and search for wanneshop, you should see something like this</p>
<p>if(NPCID == ###){ //npc id<br>
PutNPCCoords = true;<br>
WanneShop = ##; //the numbers you will put to define the shop id ex) 32<br>
}</p>
<p>next you will go into your config and find the shops or shop handler folder, you will see something like this</p>
<p>shop = 28	Legends_Shop					2	2	1052	10<br>
shop = (28=shop id)------(Legends_shop=name of shop)--------------2-----2----1052=item id----10=amount of that item</p>
<p>If you are still having problems comment again and i will add you on skype.</p>
