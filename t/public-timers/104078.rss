    <title>Public Timers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/public-timers/104078</link>
    <description>Okay... I am trying to make a few things for my Server and I am trying to make time limits for things. With that, I would like to know how to add timers that are ALWAYS going down if they are above 0. For example:

I make weapon specials. It is great! But, there&#39;s one problem. When people do their special 5 times, and their specialBar integer is 5, they have to log out for it to go back to 0 so they can use their specials again!

But alas! A public timer will do the job! While their specialBar integer is &gt;= 1 it will go down by itself, without doing a command!

----

That&#39;s like I want. It may be confusing, but basically I want to be able to make timer&#39;s so that every little while, without the user doing anything, the int goes down.

Need more info on my question? Ask me, please, I want answers!</description>

              <p>well if i do think right this is something i have done before…</p>
<p>you do got well <code>public int specialBar</code>?</p>
<p>then lets do this… this makes it go down 1 every 500 MS (½ second)</p>
<p>search for <code>public boolean process</code></p>
<p>then under it add this…</p>
<p><code>if (specialBar &gt; 0) {
	specialBar--;
	}</code></p>
<p>that makes it go down 1 each ½ second…</p>
