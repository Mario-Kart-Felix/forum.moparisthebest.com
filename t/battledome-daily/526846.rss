    <description>Well This is going to be difficult to breakdown on how the Rules go.
This is a Cartoon/Anime (japanese Animation) fight ffa or team. Every Single Day, a Matchup will be held against your favorite Animated/TV show character.
By the end of the day, a team or the character will be decided the winner. The winner will be decided at 10:00 PM EST every 2 days
and from a day after the battles decided You guys will list your battles (hopefully very similar battles) if many of the characters are different, I will put them in teams.
Eg.(if one person says &quot;naruto vs sasuke(now)&quot; and someone else says &quot;naruto vs hulk&quot; I would do either add another character which is very remotely similar to hulk and do something like naruto+ironman vs sasuke and hulk&quot; tho this very stupid. UGGH its difficult when it is one thread. ill try to edit polls or something everyday.
Or Perhaps ruling it like this:
you guys post the battle and ill list them onto the options, Pm preferably but if you must, please do. Forum post it.

              <p>I have no idea what’s going on in this thread so I’ve been neglecting it and frankly I find it silly. There’s not many members who can discuss these kind of topics anyway.</p>
<p>But if you’re keen on wanting analysis (for your so-called battledome) between the two (Naruto Uzumaki and Edward Elric), here’s my take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Naruto Uzumaki -<br>
Age: 16<br>
Power-ups: Sage mode, Bijuu mode (Nine-tailed fox)<br>
Analysis of power-ups - Sage Mode:<br>
Sage mode requires a few minutes to accumulate nature chakra. The base user (or a shadow clone) must sit completely still or risk losing the accumulated chakra. Sage mode adds the ability to manipulate chakra in order to extend the range of physical attacks or reduce the damage of incoming ones. The healing abilities and six senses of its user is doubled. The added chakra acts as a secondary storage area which allows the usage of techniques such as Fuuton: Rasenshuriken.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bijuu Mode:<br>
Bijuu mode is a cloaking of a tailed beast chakra which can be freely tapped into and mixed with the users chakra. The problem with these modes is that the tailed beast can reduce the amount of chakra tapped into despite having almost free access to it. The other problem is that the mixing of chakra is extremely complex and taxing on the user. If, at any point in time during Bijuu mode, the user exhausts all of his/her normal blue chakra, the tailed beast can completely override its vessel and take over. Access to bijuu mode, however, acts as another secondary container for chakra. With the already immense chakra levels of the bijuu itself, it allows for multiple usages high chakra intensive techniques such as Fuuton: Rasenshuriken, Oodama Rasengan, and Taijuu Kage Bushin as well as using them in combination with each other. The user gains an acute sense to ill intent and can identify transformations without having to read chakra disturbances. The manipulation of chakra to several muscles allow for gains in speed and reaction times.</p>
<p>Techniques:<br>
Kage Bushin<br>
Sexy No Juutsu<br>
Rasengan<br>
Frog Style: Summoning Technique<br>
Replacement Jutsu</p>
<p>Tactics:<br>
Learn via execution<br>
Never give up attitude.<br>
Would rather jump straight into a situation than conjure a strategy.</p>
<p>Things to keep in mind:<br>
Naruto’s clones upon defeat or release, return its information back to Naruto.<br>
Naruto’s base blue chakra is extremely large even without the Kyuubi inside him. This is likely traits passed on by Minato and Kushina.</p>
<ul>
<li>Edward Elric -<br>
Age: 16 (18 at end)<br>
Ability: Transmutation of any and all materials without an alchemy circle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Analysis of Ed’s tactics:<br>
Strategist on par with Shikamaru if willing to make such claims. Acute reaction times. Forces his automail under stress to allow for movements not normally built for humans (landing on a wall horizontally to reduce force). Can use the environment as his weapon, deadlier inside buildings. Practitioner of martial arts. Due to opening “The Door”, Edward has seen “The Truth of the World”.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>In an open field, Naruto would have an advantage, however, in a cave system or closed space, Edward could overwhelm Naruto easily without giving him a chance to fight back.</p>
<p>Take my short analysis for what its worth. Edward doesn’t have much info because he only has one ability while Naruto has many. Edward is a strategists and <span class="bbcode-i">almost never</span> fought alone.</p>
