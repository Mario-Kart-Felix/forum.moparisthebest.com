<p>I’ve scripted Morrowind and many other Elder Scrolls games and if scripting this is the same thing as scripting the Elder Scrolls (Which it looks like so, just the name of the commands are different and some are new to me) then you should be able to set the NPC’s “Fight” status to a #. For RS, I am taking a guess that it is 0 - 1. 0 being they are passive and 1 being they are aggressive. It still could be from 0 - 100 like in the Elder Scrolls but I don’t see how that would work for RS, knowing the game itself.[/quote]</p>
<p>Really? You gotta show off lollllll</p>

              <p>in NPCHandler.java</p>
<p>search for <code>

Add the case to it. (the case is the id of your npc)</p>
<p>then search for</p>
<p><code>
public int getDistanceForNpc</code><br>
this is the distance, if the player get’s in this area the npc will get aggressive and attack.<br>
The return is the distance, the case is your npcid again, so add it there to</p>

<p>My guess is see you can find some sort of ‘set’ command to set the NPC’s fight, or whatever it is called, to 1 or 100. But please don’t take this as an answer since hadn’t scripted my own RS Server… Yet…</p>
