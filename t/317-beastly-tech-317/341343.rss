About Beastly Tech: Beastly Tech was originally a regular old forum that provided an extensive amount of boards for various types of discussions including subjects related to the internet, technology and regular life, but after some deep thought, I decided to add some other activities that users could enjoy whilst waiting for new posts on the forum. So far I&#39;ve added some neat little tools like an anonymous email sender, as well as some simple services such as forum and general software installs. Even though those are kind of &quot;cool&quot;, I wanted something even cooler and something that would bring much more traffic through Beastly Tech, a Runescape private server! Despite me mainly being a website developer, I&#39;m going to try my hardest to create a successful Runescape private server, but I&#39;m in dire need of help. 

Resources I already have:
- &quot;Unlimited&quot; paid web hosting from Host Gator. (Paid monthly)
- A .com domain to present the website in a professional manner. (Paid annually)
- A dedicated server for the private server to be hosted one. (Owned by a friend but he no longer needs it)
- A standard IP.Board (Invision Power Board) license. (Was a one time payment of $149.99 USD)

Goals:
- Create an entertaining and exciting server that maintains a stable economy at all times.
- Create a server that has an extremely friendly environment for users that decide to play Beastly Tech.
- Create a server that has perfected the majority of the most important features of a server.

As I&#39;ve mentioned before, I do not have much experience as a private server coder and I&#39;m definitely not afraid to admit that. This is why I&#39;m trying to put together a development team. Unlike most users who decide to create a development team, I do not give up on things I&#39;ve started. Whether it&#39;s successful or not, I will not stop working until it&#39;s completely dead. Yes, I realize other users in hope of starting successful communities have given this speech before, but I will always stay true to my word, that&#39;s one promise I can confidently make. 

Base source: Dusk has decided to use Project Insanity as the base source of the Beastly Tech private server.

That being said, here are the positions I need filled.

- Server developer (1)
- Client developer (1-2)

As for graphics and web development, I have everything covered.

<p>Nice try to sound “professional”. You have to handle classes in RSPS, rofl. Unless you use voids, then theres no other way. And classes save you a shitload of time.</p>

<p>and if your reffering to my post in the help section why dont you try doing the following,</p>
<p>make an interface with a kick button,<br>
then make the interface show up when you right click player options on the player,<br>
then when the interface opens store a global variable that is the players name that you can then<br>
use in a different file, to be used in a command to then kick said player.</p>

I’ll stay up late working on something or even learning something completely new so that I can finish whatever needs to be done.

<p>I’ll think about it… I’ve done things similar in the past and they didn’t end well. Seeing as I’m blindly recruiting members to help out though, I don’t think there’s much of a difference between “collaborating” with you and recruiting random members from Mopar to help me in my quest of creating a successful Runescape private server. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>All of the positions are still open. It seems as if no one has shown any interest in helping out, but like I said, I won’t be giving up.</p>

<p>About Beastly Tech: Beastly Tech was originally a regular old forum that provided an extensive amount of boards for various types of discussions including subjects related to the internet, technology and regular life, but after some deep thought, I decided to add some other activities that users could enjoy whilst waiting for new posts on the forum. So far I’ve added some neat little tools like an anonymous email sender, as well as some simple services such as forum and general software installs. Even though those are kind of “cool”, I wanted something even cooler and something that would bring much more traffic through Beastly Tech, a Runescape private server! Despite me mainly being a website developer, I’m going to try my hardest to create a successful Runescape private server, but I’m in dire need of help.</p>
<p>Resources I already have:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Unlimited” paid web hosting from Host Gator. (Paid monthly)</li>
<li>A .com domain to present the website in a professional manner. (Paid annually)</li>
<li>A dedicated server for the private server to be hosted one. (Owned by a friend but he no longer needs it)</li>
<li>A standard IP.Board (Invision Power Board) license. (Was a one time payment of $149.99 USD)</li>
</ul>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an entertaining and exciting server that maintains a stable economy at all times.</li>
<li>Create a server that has an extremely friendly environment for users that decide to play Beastly Tech.</li>
<li>Create a server that has perfected the majority of the most important features of a server.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I’ve mentioned before, I do not have much experience as a private server coder and I’m definitely not afraid to admit that. This is why I’m trying to put together a development team. Unlike most users who decide to create a development team, I do not give up on things I’ve started. Whether it’s successful or not, I will not stop working until it’s completely dead. Yes, I realize other users in hope of starting successful communities have given this speech before, but I will always stay true to my word, that’s one promise I can confidently make.</p>
<p>Base source: Dusk has decided to use Project Insanity as the base source of the Beastly Tech private server.</p>
<p>That being said, here are the positions I need filled.</p>
<ul>
<li>Server developer (1)</li>
<li>Client developer (1-2)</li>
</ul>
<p>As for graphics and web development, I have everything covered.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in applying for the Beastly Tech development team, please fill out this form.</p>
