<p>Hmm, what if they banned all guns so stuff like this would never happen again?  What?  They already did years ago?  IT’S NOT WORKING!!!</p>
<p>Idiots (in the british government), if you outlaw guns, only outlaws like this loon will have them and use them, and then all of the victims have nothing to defend themselves with.  If a guy tried this where I live, chances are he wouldn’t kill many people at all until someone else killed him in self defense.</p>

<p>Yeah, the differences is shootings like this are a weekly tradition in the US. The last one like this was in 1996 in britain.</p>

<p>No country is ever going to eliminate gun crime, but I’d say the UK has done a pretty good job at reducing it compared to other countries.</p>
<p>Yes, less people would have died if the people had guns which they could use to shoot the lunatic, but we’d just end up having more gun related crimes which means more deaths.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Who cares what the crime is committed with?  A bow, gun, knife, bat or bazooka.  The fact is that since the UK banned guns, crime in the UK has skyrocketed since the law-abiding citizens are defenseless.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><span class="mention">@MITB</span>: the shootings that occur in Europe are mostly done by loons. Loons who got their hands on a gun because they, or a relative was allowed to own a gun legally. Last year a German kid shot some of his fellow students. He used his fathers gun, for which his father had a permit. A lot of these shootings are done by <span class="bbcode-b">relatives</span> of those who are allowed to own a gun. The owner can be a stable person, but his family isn’t checked. Putting a gun in a safe doesn’t mean that your son can’t use it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That seems like a pretty fair statement.  I think anyone, anywhere, who goes around killing people is a loon.  Including here in the USA.  The difference is that here the potential victims have the right to defend themselves, so this is a deterrent if the person isn’t too crazy, and if they are too crazy then law-abiding citizens with guns can put a stop to the killing without waiting for the police who may not get there until it is too late.[/quote]</p>
<p>um… If thats true why is the government releasing official crime statistics showing crime is decreasing?</p>
<p>ANYWAY</p>
<p>England have found a new striker<br>
Hes a taxi driver from cumbria<br>
Apparently he’s had more shots on target in the last 12 hours than Heskey’s had in his whole career.</p>

              <p>It’s not quite fair to compare the USA as a whole to the UK, because each individual state in the USA has it’s own gun laws, and the states with the highest crime, such as Illinois (where Chicago is), California, and New York, have the strictest gun laws of all.  I know for a fact in Illinois you can’t buy or own ANY gun (not even a shotgun, for instance) without getting a permit from the government far in advance of purchase, yet people in Chicago die daily from gun crime and the stupid Illinois politicians (like our current president…) think stricter gun laws are the solution, when they are the problem.</p>

<p>Also, the large majority of the gun crime that does occur in this country is all targeted, they’re not random attacks on civilians. These mass shootings are most of the time, not carried out criminals - they’re ordinary people who for whatever reason have had that switch flipped and then gone on their little rampage.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I believe that is how it is in every country.  Non-insane criminals aren’t going to go on a murdering rampage, there is no money in it.  However they will rob, rape, or commit other crimes at gunpoint and sometimes kill during the commission.  A large deterrent to this is knowing that their target on any given day could be armed with and trained to use a gun, obviously if guns are illegal this pretty much goes away all together.</p>

              <p>I’ve got more to say on this, but I’ll do it when I’m more clear headed… have to say though that I was of course wrong to put the comment about most of our gun crime being gang related next to the UK stat and not the US stat, thats some horrible skewing, I guess you guys have the same gang problems as, say, London does in your big cities, just perhaps not concentrated in such small areas.</p>
<p>It was probably also wrong to bring out the Limbaugh comments again, but it’s just far too funny an image to imagine Frell as a little Rush in these threads - sorry. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>I’d agree with more strict laws, but like i said here guns are so common because they’re used alot by hunters and theres tons of them. In the uk its easy to have extremely tight laws because people shouldn’t need a gun for anything. If you ban guns here it would be too late. And as mitb said everyone would give them up but criminals, and it would skyrocket and a huge black market would be created.</p>
<p>The US is also highly gang infested in major cities, and they have people murdered monthly. What about the homicides committed with a gun on innocent civilians that weren’t gang related or had previous crime records?</p>

<p>The stats simply don’t match up with what the gun nuts are saying. We have a lower non-firearm homicide rate than you (despite the fact that we are supposedly defenceless and easy targets) and your gun homicide rate is WAY higher - and this isn’t even taking into account non-homicide gun crime such as armed robbery, mainly because it’s 4am and digging through stats isn’t good for anyones brain.</p>

It would make sense that gun crime would rise when guns are legal as opposed to illegal, but not when you pass concealed carry laws (laws allowing citizens who meet requirements, take a class, and apply for a permit to carry a concealed handgun) because then crime (including gun crime) drops big time.<br>

What is there to address? Of course crime in that one area is going to increase. That’s a very piecemeal way to look at the subject though when the view should be on crime with any weapon. I notice Thug Life mentioned knifings being common in the UK (we have the problem here too with people carrying knives). What difference does it make that someone dies at knifepoint instead of gunpoint?</p>

<p>I just want an outright ban on guns in the UK, other than culling and policing we don’t need them at all.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, way to treat all sports shooters as second class citizens. Don’t kid yourself, guns have many valid uses besides self defence and only a fool would disagree.<br>
“Hi, you can’t participate in your olympic sport anymore because guns are now banned.”</p>
<p>Also, you are all REALLY underestimating the ease with which someone can obtain a firearm unlawfully. Two years ago I would have (and often did) spout the same shit – I believe I have even done so on this very forum.<br>
And then my mum remarried, so now I have a stepfather who works as a gunsmith (he’s the youngest in the state of NSW, and probably the country, at 41 years of age).<br>
The first thing I discovered is the prominence of illegal firearms, which surprised me; I thought they only existed in the deepest, darkest corners of the continent. The truth is that a trip to the local pub and a talk to a perhaps shady looking character can get you one.</p>
<p>So it’s not true that banning them completely would work. In fact, it’s a stupid mistake to make. This is Australia that I’m talking about – we don’t have neighbouring countries that guns can be smuggled from. The UK on the other hand is part of the EU.<br>
There’s never going to be a shortage of illegal weapons, despite the wishes of any government.</p>

<p>One of the main factors of owning a gun in the UK is for its purpose, they supposedly do more stringent checks if you don’t live in a rural area and have legitimate usage for the gun - e.g fucking up some animal who fucks up your animals.</p>
