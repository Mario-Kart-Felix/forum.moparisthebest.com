    <title>Wealth Evaluator? You mean money maker</title>

    <description>RuneScape&#39;s latest update included a nifty tool, the Wealth Evaluator.

There&#39;s a tl;dr at the bottom.

[quote=&quot;Solomon&quot;]Greetings, adventurer.

Ever pondered precisely how far your riches go? Speculated on the sum total of your possessions? Guess no more – use my wealth evaluator as a guide to find out how valuable your assets could be!

Using this fantastic new tool, you may view the amount of wealth you possess – both gold and items – in your:

Inventory
Worn Equipment
Bank
Grand Exchange offers
Grand Exchange collection
Follower
Money pouch
Dragon Keepsake box
Items lent out
Treasure chest
Total overall wealth
What&#39;s more, you can prove your worth and share the facts of your riches with your friends chat, clan chat and local chat![/quote]
This offer seems nice, right? A nifty tool that can show off how rich you are. I have friends that would LOVE this, because they have bills worth, and would have fun flaunting just that.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[color=red]Please do note, the wealth evaluator is a rental-only item. Once purchased you must activate it; once activated you will have 14 days to utilise it&lt;/blockquote&gt;. By purchasing multiple rentals you can acquire the wealth evaluator for up to 6 months at a time – open it up in the backpack interface to see how much time you have remaining.[/quote]

Note: that spelling mistake is actually on the page. I didn&#39;t spell utilize wrong.

And then if you head to the FAQ:
[quote=&quot;Mod Matthe&quot;][b]Do I need to pay real money to get the Wealth Evaluator?[/b]
The Wealth Evaluator can be purchased using RuneCoins, which you can either buy from our website, or by redeeming a Bond bought from another player or the Grand Exchange for the RuneCoins you need. 

[b]How much does the Wealth Evaluator cost?[/b]
The Wealth Evaluator costs 35 RuneCoins for 2 weeks of use, 32 RuneCoins for Members.[/quote]
It would cost a bit over $5 to get the wealth evaluator for 6 months (non members).

[img]http://edthena.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/billy-mays.jpg[/img]

They don&#39;t have an option to buy RuneCoins to match near the cost for 6 months (for non members). They offer 200 coins for 4.99 and 420 coins for $9.99. But wait, it cost 455 RuneCoins for 6 months (416 for Members). That means, if you do happen to be a non-member, you have to buy the 900 coin pack for $20. If you&#39;re a member you can buy the pack for $9.99. So obviously the members get the real deal out of it.

Meaning, if someone did the above math, they would be like &quot;if I go buy members, I can get a discount&quot;. Which leads them into yet another trap.
Now you&#39;re paying for membership, which is $7.95/Month (last I checked, assuming you&#39;re buying 1/mo time). When that one month is up, it&#39;s expected that you have a lot of member content and so forth, which then they consider that since they&#39;re already a member, might as well keep the benefits. Don&#39;t want to lose all the goodies.

Well played Jagex, well played.

[b]tl;dr[/b] Jagex is making money by selling crap in game again.

I bought it and found out that it calculates every item in your bank, inventory, grand exchange slots, etc… It even calculates non-tradeable items like superior ports armours, minigame hybrid armour, which are a lot (50m+ for each part), degraded armours/weapons. So, I will not be buying this again, even though I only bought a bond in-game for 6.5m. I really need to stop buying bonds for Solomon’s stuff. I end up never using them after 2 weeks from buying them. I’ve spent roughly 105m on cosmetic stuff lol.<br>

How does it calculate the value of something you can’t trade??? If you can’t trade something, then no one has a desire for it. No desire, no demand. No demand, no value.[/quote]<br>
It’s a bit bugged right now.</p>

[/quote]Giving you the runecoins back as credit IS a refund, PLUS they let you keep the item, the stupidity hurts my brain</p>
<p>@ Fuscate - Why are you being a dick to customer service? People like you are why people hate retail jobs. They can’t stop what corporate does, and being a dick only makes someone elses job harder and more frustrating. You could have clearly said what was wrong in the first message (untradables being worth money etc) without being a dick, and asked for a refund there. They did more than they had to by letting you keep the item <span class="bbcode-u">and</span> giving you credit.[/quote]</p>
<p>This is an item that has been requested by the community for <span class="bbcode-b">years</span>. While my actions in the message may have been directed to the wrong person, often messages like these are passed onto higher staff members. My hope in this was catching the attention of someone who could publicly address why the content was broken on the day of it’s release.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks Jagex has been rolling out a wave of hypocrisy. When micro transactions were released into the game in the form of the Squeal of Fortune, Mod MMG specifically stated that they would never release anything into the spins that was not available by other means. In the last couple of weeks, this has all fallen apart. Items such as the Silverhawk Boots are completely purchasable Agility xp. People have literally bought 200m xp with the feathers that are available from micro transactions. Not only do these boots allow players to <span class="bbcode-i">completely</span> afk Agility (arguably the slowest and most painstaking skill in the game) but it allows them to do it at rates of up to 3x of what is available for players who don’t spin to win. Obviously this has disgruntled a large portion of the community, including myself.</p>
<p>The point of the matter is, giving me Runecoins as credit is completely useless. I am not someone who uses the store, as I don’t support what they are putting on it. I purchased this item with the thought that I would have permanent access to this feature, but until you actually buy it, there is no fine print that explains it is only a ‘rental’ item. The last straw on this was that it didn’t even work. I had hoped these messages would be passed onto the bug report team at least, but unfortunately that didn’t happen either. However their second reply was satisfying, but I didn’t take up the offer of the credit.</p>

I was going with the context.<br>
Sure they’re letting him keep it (because he paid for it) and they’re giving him more coins, but the catch is:</p>
<blockquote>On your [b]next purchase[/b] on Solomon's Store, I'll give 32 RuneCoins for free!</blockquote>
He has to buy something. I don't browse Solomon's often, but not many of the items in there are cheap (RuneCoin wise). Don't know many that are less than 32 coins, but again, I don't browse it.

<p>@ Fuscate - Why are you being a dick to customer service? People like you are why people hate retail jobs. They can’t stop what corporate does, and being a dick only makes someone elses job harder and more frustrating. You could have clearly said what was wrong in the first message (untradables being worth money etc) without being a dick, and asked for a refund there. They did more than they had to by letting you keep the item <span class="bbcode-u">and</span> giving you credit.</p>

              <p>I am currently in a heated discussion with customer support regarding this item:</p>
<blockquote>Hello,
<p>Today I purchased the new ‘Wealth Evaluator’ expecting to receive an accurate description on how much I am worth. Instead I received a broken item that displayed a figure far higher than what I actually own, almost like you are attempting to taunt me with wealth that I haven’t purchased with bonds like you expect the rest of the community to do so. I don’t want to go into how I feel about this content, I won’t elaborate on the fact that this item is a symbol of the gradual decline of your company’s integrity because that would be poor form on my part to dump onto a poor customer support staff member.</p>
<p>I request a full refund of the 32 Runecoins I used to purchase this absolute garbage and ask that my access to it be revoked as I have no interest in something that will inevitably be broken forever.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Fuscate</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Hey Fuscate,
<p>Thanks for getting in touch. Allow me to help.</p>
<p>I’ve had a look at your account and I can see here that you purchased the Wealth Evaluator on the 17th of March.</p>
<p>As stated in the description of the item, it will calculate the worth of the items you have that are placed or stored:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inventory: everything in your Backpack.</li>
<li>Equipped items: everything in your Worn Equipment.</li>
<li>Bank: the contents of your Bank.</li>
<li>Grand Exchange offers: everything you have up for sale on the Grand Exchange</li>
<li>Grand Exchange collection: everything you have successfully bought on the Grand Exchange, but have yet to collect.</li>
<li>Familiar: everything you have stored in a beast of burden.</li>
<li>Money pouch: the coins stored in your Money Pouch.</li>
<li>Dragon Keepsake box: anything you have stored as a cosmetic override, using a dragon keepsake key.</li>
<li>Items lent out: any items you have currently out on loan.</li>
<li>Treasure chest: anything you have stored in the treasure chest reward from the Carnillean Rising quest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just so you know, refunds for used items purchased on Solomon’s Store are not possible.</p>
<p>I know this is not the answer that you are looking for, this is why I have an exclusive offer for you. On your next purchase on Solomon’s Store, I’ll give 32 RuneCoins for free!</p>
<p>Let me know if you’d take us up on this offer.</p>

<blockquote>Hello,
<p>Thank you for replying, I appreciate that you took the time to read the appeal to this absolute rubbish of an item, however I still feel I have been punished by the ruthless fist of the Solomans store.</p>
<p>The item is designed to give an accurate description of all of the aspects you listed. While it may give a price, it doesn’t do it accurately. It price checks a large amount of items incorrectly at a considerably higher price than what they are actually worth. Items such as untradeables are listed as being over 100 million coins each, yet are untradeable which renders it completely redundant.</p>
<p>I purchased this item with the full intent of being satisfied with spending my precious Runecoins on it. While they may just be numbers to you, they hold a certain sentimental value to myself and removing them from my possession breaks my heart.</p>
<p>When you purchase something, you expect to be buying something that works to the standards of the description given. The fact of the matter is, this item does not do that. It is broken content and I still request a full refund of my purchase.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Fuscate</p>

              <p>RuneScape’s latest update included a nifty tool, the Wealth Evaluator.</p>
<p>There’s a tl;dr at the bottom.</p>
<p>[quote=“Solomon”]Greetings, adventurer.</p>
<p>Ever pondered precisely how far your riches go? Speculated on the sum total of your possessions? Guess no more – use my wealth evaluator as a guide to find out how valuable your assets could be!</p>
<p>Using this fantastic new tool, you may view the amount of wealth you possess – both gold and items – in your:</p>
<p>Inventory<br>
Worn Equipment<br>
Bank<br>
Grand Exchange offers<br>
Grand Exchange collection<br>
Follower<br>
Money pouch<br>
Dragon Keepsake box<br>
Items lent out<br>
Treasure chest<br>
Total overall wealth<br>
What’s more, you can prove your worth and share the facts of your riches with your friends chat, clan chat and local chat![/quote]<br>
This offer seems nice, right? A nifty tool that can show off how rich you are. I have friends that would LOVE this, because they have bills worth, and would have fun flaunting just that.<br>

<blockquote>[color=red]Please do note, the wealth evaluator is a rental-only item. Once purchased you must activate it; once activated you will have 14 days to utilise it</blockquote>. By purchasing multiple rentals you can acquire the wealth evaluator for up to 6 months at a time – open it up in the backpack interface to see how much time you have remaining.[/quote]
<p>Note: that spelling mistake is actually on the page. I didn’t spell utilize wrong.</p>
<p>And then if you head to the FAQ:</p>
<p>[quote=“Mod Matthe”]<span class="bbcode-b">Do I need to pay real money to get the Wealth Evaluator?</span><br>
The Wealth Evaluator can be purchased using RuneCoins, which you can either buy from our website, or by redeeming a Bond bought from another player or the Grand Exchange for the RuneCoins you need.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How much does the Wealth Evaluator cost?</span><br>
The Wealth Evaluator costs 35 RuneCoins for 2 weeks of use, 32 RuneCoins for Members.[/quote]<br>
It would cost a bit over $5 to get the wealth evaluator for 6 months (non members).</p>
<p><img src="http://edthena.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/billy-mays.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>They don’t have an option to buy RuneCoins to match near the cost for 6 months (for non members). They offer 200 coins for 4.99 and 420 coins for $9.99. But wait, it cost 455 RuneCoins for 6 months (416 for Members). That means, if you do happen to be a non-member, you have to buy the 900 coin pack for $20. If you’re a member you can buy the pack for $9.99. So obviously the members get the real deal out of it.</p>
<p>Meaning, if someone did the above math, they would be like “if I go buy members, I can get a discount”. Which leads them into yet another trap.<br>
Now you’re paying for membership, which is $7.95/Month (last I checked, assuming you’re buying 1/mo time). When that one month is up, it’s expected that you have a lot of member content and so forth, which then they consider that since they’re already a member, might as well keep the benefits. Don’t want to lose all the goodies.</p>
