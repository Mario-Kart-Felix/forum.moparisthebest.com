    <description>Like I posted here: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,560693.msg4204289.html#msg4204289

Javadocs are here: http://www.projectrsc.com/doc/index.html source code will be published once I have spoken with pompano and had a chance to look if there is anything that needs urgently fixing or w/e and also obv between time spent on prs06

[quote=&quot;KO9, post:341, topic:457768&quot;]P.S.: Cannot get on site yet as I need to reset my password in database and honestly I have not slept for 30+ hours I am tired will do it soon...

Here is the current situation.

As many of you are probably aware there are a ton of problems with this server/project. It didn&#39;t really take off or go quite how any of us expected and this is really down to a number of things from developers leaving to core staff losing interest and being too busy with personal issues.

The_Berg (The Greens as you may already know) was developing and running the server up until now. He however PM&#39;d me on IRC saying he no longer wants to run the server:

[quote]
[08:39:46] &lt;ollie&gt; are you root btw?
[08:39:49] &lt;The_Berg&gt; yep
[08:39:54] &lt;ollie&gt; can you give me root details?
[08:39:57] &lt;ollie&gt; or you not want me to have
[08:40:03] &lt;The_Berg&gt; i&#39;ll give you the server tbh
[08:40:07] &lt;The_Berg&gt; im done running it
[08:40:08] &lt;The_Berg&gt; lol
[08:40:11] &lt;ollie&gt; why
[08:40:14] &lt;ollie&gt; dude
[08:40:15] &lt;ollie&gt; no
[08:40:15] &lt;The_Berg&gt; ive killed it
[08:40:18] &lt;ollie&gt; i can&#39;t run the whole thing
[08:40:20] &lt;ollie&gt; i can help you
[08:40:25] &lt;ollie&gt; but not all of it sorry
[08:40:27] &lt;ollie&gt; i don&#39;t have time man
[08:40:33] &lt;ollie&gt; let me run it with u
[08:40:42] &lt;The_Berg&gt; pompano and swo0osh still run it
[08:40:45] &lt;ollie&gt; i will lead the project if u want
[08:40:47] &lt;ollie&gt; yes
[08:40:47] &lt;ollie&gt; obv
[08:40:49] &lt;The_Berg&gt; you three can split w/e profits
[08:40:53] &lt;The_Berg&gt; i dont want it anymore
[08:40:59] &lt;ollie&gt; will you stay dev?
[08:41:00] &lt;ollie&gt; head dev
[08:41:01] &lt;The_Berg&gt; its not worth the stress and time
[08:41:03] &lt;ollie&gt; or?
[08:41:22] &lt;The_Berg&gt; i&#39;ll admit
[08:41:26] &lt;The_Berg&gt; you&#39;re one hell of an admin
[/quote]

The convo goes on but I tried my best to keep The Berg on board but he really felt his time with the project was up.

I know that I may know have done the best job last time I was running the project however there are also some issues behind like such as issues between staff members and to be blunt I found it hard to command respect and actually have people do what I ask and be informed and kept in the loop about everything. To put it shortly, I didn&#39;t feel I was in control or running the project at all.

I am now basically in full control of the project and will just run it how I think is best for the community and server in general. Basically my end goal and vision is to have RSC fully replicated and completed within 6 months! I know that this seems optimistic and I know that this community has seen it and heard it all before about big projects that are going to be amazing and do so much development yet nothing ever comes of it. You guys know me, you guys know my history you may or may not know the work I have done on PRS06 so far in the little time I have had to do it (http://projectrs06.com/) check it out I have been working 18-50 hour days (not shitting to you).

There are a lot of developers asking me to help on projectrs06 and tbh we have a full core dev team and an overflow of devs to work on our open source software (nova, join #prs06code on rizon if interested). I think it would be best for the server, community and everyone (bar maybe rival servers, sorry, maybe we can talk merge or something?) in general if PRSC went fully open source. This includes data files (NOT PLAYER DATA), npc spawns, drop data etc and FULL server source code available to anyone who wants it via a public repo to do as they want. I will add contribs who want to work on the project. I don&#39;t care who you are, our history or shit if you have the knowledge, motivation and maturity to work on this project then come by #projectcode on rizon (this will be new prsc public dev chan).

I will be making some changes to the server in the up coming days/weeks as dev team grows (hopefully) and work is done. Give me some time though guys I am very busy with PRS06 right now and have to split time. Great things will come I hope and at the end I really really hope this community ends up with a completed fully working RSC source that I can leave as my legacy.[/quote]</description>

              <p>[quote=“Not_a_bot, post:31, topic:478840”]I don’t follow…you’re saying the DQ plugin system is obsolete yet there’s no actual plugin system in use on any other source at the moment…so how are we calling this “obsolete” (I assume based of time alone)? Yes I understand the meaning of obsolete, but in this field everything goes obsolete in a matter of time, so lets cut the semantics and get specific.[/quote]There being a plugin system in another source also has nothing to do with it. Again, back to the cassette player… It doesn’t matter if you have the most cutting edge cassette player or even the only one, there are CD players, MP3 players, etc.</p>
<p>Naming specifics would take too much time seeing it’s pretty much everything, and you should really name what you think isn’t obsolete.</p>
<p>[quote=“Not_a_bot, post:31, topic:478840”]Anyway, so I quickly browsed the one on MoparClassic (I assume that’s the one you work on). Quickly browsing through, it doesn’t seem completely different to the one on DQ, in fact it just looks like a more organized version of it (feel free to point out if I’ve been looking at the wrong repository (<a href="https://github.com/Lothy/MoparClassic/tree/master/GameServer/src/org/moparscape/msc/gs/plugins" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Lothy/MoparClassic/tree/master/GameServer/src/org/moparscape/msc/gs/plugins</a>)). I can also bet there’s not enough testing on it to warrant it even usable yet on production, at least with the DQ version is has been tested out (while not perfect, its usable). Please clarify.[/quote]You’re looking at the wrong branch for one… In addition, Lothy’s repo isn’t the most current. AFAIK this one is: <a href="https://github.com/Joe0/MoparClassic" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Joe0/MoparClassic</a></p>
<p>The plugin system you’re referring to is being removed, because it’s a heaping pile of shit. Also, it was something left over from RSCA, and I find it very funny that you think it’s more organized, because it’s older than DQ and PRSCs.</p>
<p>Currently, there are two types of ‘plugins’:<br>

<p>Pretty much the only thing I don’t like about them is the way they’re bound… Though, using Scala in place of configuration files is something that is becoming increasingly more common and you can really see why in the ObjectActionManager.</p>
<p>Also, I think the owner of that repo isn’t pushing to Lothy’s repo because things aren’t ready. So, I really wouldn’t consider either system complete until he makes a pull request.</p>

</aside>
<p>Its quite relevant. You’re implying the generalization of one’s understanding of an implementation based off <span class="bbcode-b">incomplete</span> documentation alone… (not just the general idea). If you still fail to comprehend this, I am sorry.<br>
[/quote]The structure and documentation provided, along with knowing that the source is based off DQ is enough to determine if the plugin system itself is obsolete.</p>
<p>Again, I bring up the point of a cassette player… Knowing that someone is creating something that plays music, and does so only using cassettes is enough to determine that the music player is obsolete. It doesn’t matter if said person even started making it or not, you can still definitively say that it is obsolete.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t follow…you’re saying the DQ plugin system is obsolete yet there’s no actual plugin system in use on any other source at the moment…so how are we calling this “obsolete” (I assume based of time alone)? Yes I understand the meaning of obsolete, but in this field everything goes obsolete in a matter of time, so lets cut the semantics and get specific.</p>
<p>Anyway, so I quickly browsed the one on MoparClassic (I assume that’s the one you work on). Quickly browsing through, it doesn’t seem completely different to the one on DQ, in fact it just looks like a more organized version of it (feel free to point out if I’ve been looking at the wrong repository (<a href="https://github.com/Lothy/MoparClassic/tree/master/GameServer/src/org/moparscape/msc/gs/plugins" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Lothy/MoparClassic/tree/master/GameServer/src/org/moparscape/msc/gs/plugins</a>)). I can also bet there’s not enough testing on it to warrant it even usable yet on production, at least with the DQ version is has been tested out (while not perfect, its usable). Please clarify.</p>

P.S.: Cannot get on site yet as I need to reset my password in database and honestly I have not slept for 30+ hours I am tired will do it soon…</p>
<p>Here is the current situation.</p>
<p>As many of you are probably aware there are a ton of problems with this server/project. It didn’t really take off or go quite how any of us expected and this is really down to a number of things from developers leaving to core staff losing interest and being too busy with personal issues.</p>
<p>The_Berg (The Greens as you may already know) was developing and running the server up until now. He however PM’d me on IRC saying he no longer wants to run the server:</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>[08:39:46]  are you root btw?<br>
[08:39:49] &lt;The_Berg&gt; yep<br>
[08:39:54]  can you give me root details?<br>
[08:39:57]  or you not want me to have<br>
[08:40:03] &lt;The_Berg&gt; i’ll give you the server tbh<br>
[08:40:07] &lt;The_Berg&gt; im done running it<br>
[08:40:08] &lt;The_Berg&gt; lol<br>
[08:40:11]  why<br>
[08:40:14]  dude<br>
[08:40:15]  no<br>
[08:40:15] &lt;The_Berg&gt; ive killed it<br>
[08:40:18]  i can’t run the whole thing<br>
[08:40:20]  i can help you<br>
[08:40:25]  but not all of it sorry<br>
[08:40:27]  i don’t have time man<br>
[08:40:33]  let me run it with u<br>
[08:40:42] &lt;The_Berg&gt; pompano and swo0osh still run it<br>
[08:40:45]  i will lead the project if u want<br>
[08:40:47]  yes<br>
[08:40:47]  obv<br>
[08:40:49] &lt;The_Berg&gt; you three can split w/e profits<br>
[08:40:53] &lt;The_Berg&gt; i dont want it anymore<br>
[08:40:59]  will you stay dev?<br>
[08:41:00]  head dev<br>
[08:41:01] &lt;The_Berg&gt; its not worth the stress and time<br>
[08:41:03]  or?<br>
[08:41:22] &lt;The_Berg&gt; i’ll admit<br>
[08:41:26] &lt;The_Berg&gt; you’re one hell of an admin</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The convo goes on but I tried my best to keep The Berg on board but he really felt his time with the project was up.</p>
<p>I know that I may know have done the best job last time I was running the project however there are also some issues behind like such as issues between staff members and to be blunt I found it hard to command respect and actually have people do what I ask and be informed and kept in the loop about everything. To put it shortly, I didn’t feel I was in control or running the project at all.</p>
<p>I am now basically in full control of the project and will just run it how I think is best for the community and server in general. Basically my end goal and vision is to have RSC fully replicated and completed within 6 months! I know that this seems optimistic and I know that this community has seen it and heard it all before about big projects that are going to be amazing and do so much development yet nothing ever comes of it. You guys know me, you guys know my history you may or may not know the work I have done on PRS06 so far in the little time I have had to do it (<a href="http://projectrs06.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://projectrs06.com/</a>) check it out I have been working 18-50 hour days (not shitting to you).</p>
<p>There are a lot of developers asking me to help on projectrs06 and tbh we have a full core dev team and an overflow of devs to work on our open source software (nova, join <span class="hashtag">#prs06code</span> on rizon if interested). I think it would be best for the server, community and everyone (bar maybe rival servers, sorry, maybe we can talk merge or something?) in general if PRSC went fully open source. This includes data files (NOT PLAYER DATA), npc spawns, drop data etc and FULL server source code available to anyone who wants it via a public repo to do as they want. I will add contribs who want to work on the project. I don’t care who you are, our history or shit if you have the knowledge, motivation and maturity to work on this project then come by <span class="hashtag">#projectcode</span> on rizon (this will be new prsc public dev chan).</p>
<p>I will be making some changes to the server in the up coming days/weeks as dev team grows (hopefully) and work is done. Give me some time though guys I am very busy with PRS06 right now and have to split time. Great things will come I hope and at the end I really really hope this community ends up with a completed fully working RSC source that I can leave as my legacy.<br>

<p>is this open source yet?</p>

I like how you’ve actually got ridden of the packethandler.xml and had it hardcoded into the server.</p>
<p>Be so much simpler to write a script auto generate new integer values for the packets then write a simpler script client side. Have an auto updating client every 12 hours regenerate packet ids recompile client update webclient and automatic download of the external client to stop bots.<br>
[/quote]How would that stop bots? They’d be hooking methods, not constructing packets from scratch…[/quote]Most bots actual do hook the methods like</p>
<p>createpacket(ID)<br>
addInt(Etc)<br>
So on so on, not actual hook the methods what invoke them. Kids just retarded in that way.</p>

<p>Again, I bring up the point of a cassette player… Knowing that someone is creating something that plays music, and does so only using cassettes is enough to determine that the music player is obsolete. It doesn’t matter if said person even started making it or not, you can still definitively say that it is obsolete.</p>

<p>Hi Not_a_bot, I was under the impression you already knew about a plugin systems architecture and familiar with the programming language Java. If you need to know anything you can start by viewing Yongs tutorials and if you can’t figure out the basics CFF and I will be more than willing to send you to the search bar. Once you figure it out then we can move on to talking about plugin systems; how they are designed, why they are designed that way and the best way for you to implement one into your own localhost server.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
