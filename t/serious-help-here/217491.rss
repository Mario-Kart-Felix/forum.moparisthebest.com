    <title>Serious help here</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/serious-help-here/217491</link>
    <description>Okay so I have the Winterlove v.3 Private server source.  It&#39;s a cleaned source so there is basically nothing on it.  No added items, no added Npc&#39;s, nothing.  I have looked at so many guides on how to make objects and none of them work right at all.  I search Client.java and it only have makeGlobalObject it doesn&#39;t have addGlobalobject.  I follow the tutorials and none of them work!  So don&#39;t flame me because none of them are working for me, I just need some 1 on 1 help here.</description>
