    <title>Pk-Point system and overall server help ~~~{LOOK HERE}~~~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-point-system-and-overall-server-help-look-here/542132</link>
    <description>Okay well to start about three days ago i downloaded this source and client that was un-named off of some unanimous website i cant even remember, and when i cracked it open i realized that it was probably the most developed 317 loading 525 gameframe/maps i had EVER seen, but the problem is, the code isn&#39;t normal...
and by that i mean that the ints you would use on any other server would work, but not this one...to make custom coloured whips i had to make switch around the-
itemDef.modifiedModelColors[1]
and the
itemDef.originalModelColors[1]
it was all very strange and im barely even starting to grasp it as its unlike anything i have ever seen before..

for example, full featured pickpocketing with stalls and dissapearing stalls, including chests.


and theres been one thing ive had a major struggle with, the Pking and wilderness

there seems to be no wilderness level or attack option on another player when im in the wild, the only way to attack them is to deliberately cast a spell on them until they die, and ive googled this and when i try to search for the &quot;nowild&quot; or relevant nothing pops up, and the pking you see, theres already the- 

public int pkPoints = 0; 

and the shop for it, and about like 30 minutes ago i added the tokens in playerassistant but, the applydead part of it whenever i go to grab some code off of a tutorial on it i get 100 errors in the compiler every time,

other than that, it seems to be a 8 1/2 server.

here are some screenies

Interesting, and there isnt some other way i can create a wild zone or re-write the wild, or is that too ridiculous?<br>
[/quote]do a google search for (and I assume you are using PI…)  for something like " PI how to make a pk zone" you should be able to find out how. Even if it’s a safe pk zone. You can make it unsafe, safe, etc to your will. That’s about the asiest way to find out how to make one.</p>

<p>Hahah i found that quite moving, and i nearly shit my fourteen-year-old-pants when i found a huge wolf spider climbing up my sleeve at 5 am in the morning, <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> hey man i really appreciate the motivation, …god i love google…</p>
