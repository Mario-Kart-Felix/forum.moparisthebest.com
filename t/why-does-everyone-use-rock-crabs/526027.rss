    <title>Why does everyone use Rock Crabs?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-does-everyone-use-rock-crabs/526027</link>
    <description>Of all the monsters in RS, why does everyone use Rock Crabs to initiate combat training in an RSPS? One could simply edit the stats of a much more interesting NPC to kill and make the grind that much more interesting. I mean, haven&#39;t we all had more than our fair share of killing Rock Crabs? Greater Demons, Hell Hounds, Orcs, Animated Armours, Minotaurs, Baby Dragons, Gnomes, AND SO MUCH MORE! I mean heck there are an infinite amount of options, yet everyone chooses the boring old generic Rock Crabs.

What are your opinions on this? If you are a server owner/coder, will you attempt to break this habit? And if you could choose a training monster, what would it be?</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Most people use rock crabs because they’re designed for a training monster. They’re a low level, can hardly hit you, and have 50hp. That’s a pretty solid number if you wish to do calculations on your skills and such. That’s also why servers that have them use Yaks. They’re designed for the exact same thing. Another NPC that I’m surprised isn’t used as often is experiments. They are also low level monsters that have a larger amount of health. Sure, if you want to be unique you could have your members fighting ice giants and such. Though, if one wishes to have a more realistic server - then fighting ice giants would be rather distasteful. I suppose you could have a training location mixed with all sorts of different monsters and still be more RS-like. Though, there’s also reason as to what Lin stated. But I’ve seen very well developed servers still using rock crabs, so it’s not entirely based on that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Even if they’re a good server, it’s still lazy. I mean why not have low defense, high HP ice giants? I would enjoy killing Ice giants a lot more than a conspicuous looking lumps of rock over and over again.</p>

spawn one monster (randomly) and set it’s hp to 25000. every 250 damage dealt, use the npc transformation mask to transforms the npc into a new monster with same hp, etc etc. to remove the use of afk-ing it for the (25000hp*xprate) experience, simply transform it to a <span class="bbcode-i">difficult</span> monster every 3500 or so damage done.<br>

<p>True this. All these big servers that get 32 players are leeches of OverloadX or something else.</p>

              <p>Of all the monsters in RS, why does everyone use Rock Crabs to initiate combat training in an RSPS? One could simply edit the stats of a much more interesting NPC to kill and make the grind that much more interesting. I mean, haven’t we all had more than our fair share of killing Rock Crabs? Greater Demons, Hell Hounds, Orcs, Animated Armours, Minotaurs, Baby Dragons, Gnomes, AND SO MUCH MORE! I mean heck there are an infinite amount of options, yet everyone chooses the boring old generic Rock Crabs.</p>
<p>What are your opinions on this? If you are a server owner/coder, will you attempt to break this habit? And if you could choose a training monster, what would it be?</p>
