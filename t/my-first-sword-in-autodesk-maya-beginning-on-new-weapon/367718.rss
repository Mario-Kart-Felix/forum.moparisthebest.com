    <description>Hey guys, so I&#39;m not really gonna say much except for this is my first model using maya. It took less than 2 minutes and I was going pretty slow when making this... :P

And here are some images of my upcoming model. I am not sure what I want to make it, whether it should be a spear/sword/mace/whip give me some feedback on what you guys would like to see. Thanks. Please, no flamming.

This one took like 10 minutes to where it is at so far because lining up all of the things perfectly was a bit of a pain in the A**.</description>
