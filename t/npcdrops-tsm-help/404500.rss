    <description>Hello

I am having trouble trying to understand how to edit the drop odds of specific items on specific monsters. For some servers its really simple and it looks like this:

//goblin
npcdrop = 100	526	1	100

I have no problem understanding this. However for most of the sources ive been downloading have the file NPCDrops.cfg set out like this:

1	995
9	995
1624	3140	1249	1247	561	995	1617	1619	1213	1249	1247	561	995	1617	1619	1213	1249	1247	561	995	1617	1619	1213	554	554	554	554	554	554	554	1249	1247	561	995	1617	1619	1213	1249	1247	561	995	1617	1619	1213	1249	1247	561	995	1617	1619	1213	

I cant seem to make any sense of this. I have tried googling the problem several times and have found the drops for these sorts of sources can be edited in NPCDrops.TSM. But it still doesnt make sense to me for example:

#growler
6250:50	995:30000	886:120	207:2	808:100	563:50	385:3
405:1	  11730:1	11710:1	11712:1	11714:1	11710:1	11712:1	15050:1

What I understand from this is that the first number (in this case 6250) is for the NPC growler, simple enough. However I dont understand what the :50 is for. Some tell me the 50 is the drop odds for growler. The drop odds for what? every drop?

The other number sequences makes sense. For instance I understand that 995:30000 means that one of growlers drops are 30000 coins (995 being the item ID, 30000 being the quantity). But how are the drop odds for this drop determined? It doesnt make any sense to me

If someone could walk me through the NPCDrops.TSM file I would be VERY appreciative :)! thanks!</description>

              <p>Sorry if im slow but I still dont understand, to me there seems only 1 place to define drop odds but several possible drops.</p>
<p>For instance I understand that item 15050 at the end of line 2 for growler is the staff of light and that the :1 means it drops one of them. What are the odds for that drop?</p>
