    <title>Some help on Port Forwarding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-help-on-port-forwarding/135535</link>
    <description>ok, this is a small guide on port forwarding, its just a few steps, if you follow it correctly your server will go online.
---------------------------------
Ok, if you are port forwarding it means you have a router and want to open your port to public.
Ok follow these steps, reply if you have any questions or problem.
STEP BY STEP GUIDE ON PORT FORWARDING

1. Go to your control panel and click on your firewall. Go to the exceptions tab and click on add port, for the name, name it the name of ur server (pk scape etc.) and the type the port as the port you using,which is normally 43594.

2. Find your router in your house, it should have some flashing lights in front of it with stuff like link etc. If you see the back of it, you should see a sticker with a password on it. Note that down,

3.Ok, next go to the cmd, you can do this by selecting run from the start menu and type in cmd.
It should open the command prompt. On, the command prompt type ipconfig.

4. There should be a list of ip&#39;s, look at the default gateway, it would something like 198.168.1.1 etc. Go to internet explorer of whatever you use to view the internet, type http://198.168.1.1 etc.

5. In should be the homepage of your router, login wth the password you noted down earlier and press login.

6.Find a tab which talks about adding ports. When you find it, make the name the name of your server and the port as the port you entered on your firewall.

7. After you saved that, log out. Now you have to make your firewall accept it. Most of the times it would as you if you would like to block it or unblock it. Press unblock if you see that pop up.

8. Go to server status page and register the server while you its online.

I don&#39;t teach guides on making a server though, i use sources. Anyway to do that, you just gotta compile and run.
 ;D Hope this helps you, PM or reply if you need help or a question.</description>
