    <title>[req] Trimming Stat Icon</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-trimming-stat-icon/103522</link>
    <description>I made a prvate server with a trimming skill, and I&#39;m replacing the farming icon with one for trimming, but my trimming icon looks like shit. Can someone make me a beter one? I need the width and height to be right about 20 pixels. Also, make the icon look like it has to do with trimming. Thanks.


Details:
Trimming Skill - Using diffrent bars (gold bar on rune fullhelm makes rune fullhelm (g)), etc.
Just wanted to be safe and point that out lol</description>
