    <description>I accidently deleted my whole open client files folder. (I still have the closed one i sent out to my players)

I need to delete all my .class files so i can edit again.

I&#39;ve tried both DJ decompiler and Cajav decompiler, but I get errors, i can&#39;t seem to figure out whats wrong.

Any help is really appreciated.

If you want me to upload the decompiled class file i&#39;ll do that.</description>
