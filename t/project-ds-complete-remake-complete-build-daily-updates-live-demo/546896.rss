    <description>[center][b]Hello and welcome too project DS development team thread![/b][/center]

It&#39;s been a very long time since I last sat down and thought of making a runescape private server, since finding out the old runescape 2007 server is back online I have enjoyed quite a few hours gameplay on the official game.. but still something lacks with the game, maybe imagination and development?! Well here&#39;s what I have planned!

[b]The plan[/b]
The plan is too build up my server again, there is literally nothing added too the source I made a few years ago.. a old project I didn&#39;t have time for anymore. Luckily till now! So I have lots of work in progress before the server goes up for live demos! But combat will be the first thing remastered along with building a small world for players too start their journey. The world will much be build like runescape eventually, and this is why I want the live demo too be online when this happens, I am not looking for a major succesful server, but I&#39;d like too play runescape (as runescape is) but with more development than what Jagex are doing with their OSRS server, adding what people actually want in the game! 

[b]The Crew[/b]
I am looking for a number of things, mainly for the website and graphics side of things but I will accept anyone who wants too help client sided also. Server sided will remain just in my hand as I really do not want anyone to leech this is future.

[i]Graphics Designers[/i]
Will probably need too complete tasks given fairly quickly, we will want a number of different banners and buttons for client and website. You will also be responsible for taking screen shots of anything needed for forum posts.

[i]Website/Forum designers[/i]
You will be in charge of the complete website, from the frontpage too the main forum itself. I will also like SQL experience as I will be adding a Database too the server for highscores sometime in the future

[b]How do I apply?[/b]
Simple! Just post below with any relevant information you may think is helpful, please provide a sample of your work.
