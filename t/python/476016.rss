Python is nowhere near as widely adopted as RoR unfortunately. Alot of the configuration for a framework like Django will probably require you to contact your host and have them configure it so you can have it used. Other than that, programming with Python on the web is very doable and is becoming more popular. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I actually just started a hosting package from a place that apparently offered “Python” for the webhosting users but couldn’t even configure mod_wsgi… Quite disappointing.<br>

<p>I see. So I should wait a bit?</p>

<p>Not necessarily. Just ask some questions in a sales chat even if the host claims to offer Python support.</p>
<p>As for using Python over PHP or RoR, I don’t know too much to give any insight on this. But if a large site like Instagram happens to use it; should be fine.</p>
