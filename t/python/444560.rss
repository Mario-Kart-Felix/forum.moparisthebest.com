    <description>I get no errors, just nothing pops up in the idle.

[code=python]def FriendsOnlineOption():

    Friends_Online = 1

    while Friends_Online &gt; 0:
        print(&#39;You have some friends online&#39;)
        while Friends_Online &lt; 0:
            print(&#39;You cannot have less than 0 friends online, your chat is broken.&#39;)
            while Friends_Online == 0:
                print(&#39;You have no friends online, you sir are forever alone.&#39;)[/code]</description>

<p>You can do the same things with different languages and it’s all up to your personal preferences and influences.</p>

<p>I know it’s terrible, I went to a website saw an example for while statements, and tried plugging it into something. Friends_Online was the first thing that came to my mind, there was no specific need for it. I just don’t like going straight by the tutorials. I like looping my own things into the tutorials, not so I can release, so that I can say at least I learned something if it works.</p>

Python is an amazing and good language to start out with, you’re contradicting yourself. If you posted a code in java here I could be like “Are you trying to learn Java to sound cool? Python is a much easier language to start out with and it will help you in the future.”</p>
