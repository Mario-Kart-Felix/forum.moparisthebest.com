    <description>Looking to host a server off my computer for the next 6 months
I run 64 bit linux on a 64 bit amd with 6 gigs of ram.
I can help a little with the programming but mainly im looking to host and manage the server.
Also can give some effort to the website but as far as integration goes, im clueless.
Serious inquirers let me know.</description>
