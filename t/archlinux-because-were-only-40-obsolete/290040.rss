    <title>ArchLinux: Because we&#39;re only 40% Obsolete</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/archlinux-because-were-only-40-obsolete/290040</link>
    <description>Another interesting thing I found posted on the Arch forums.

According to [url=http://oswatershed.org/]THIS[/url] article archlinux is the most up-to-date distro (according to the distros he compared)

Which would be

Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Funtoo, Sabayon, Slackware, Debian, and Opensuse.

Obviously 40% of the packages Arch maintains aren&#39;t out-of-date he monitored a select group of packages for each distro (to make it fair I suppose) which included

[code]
alsa-utils, cups, emacs, firefox, gcc, ghostscript-gpl, gimp, glibc, gnome-desktop, gnupg, httpd (apache), kdebase, linux, NetworkManager, openssh, pidgin, postgresql, python, ruby, xorg-server
[/code]

              <p>Also its not like the packages that make their way into core/extra aren’t tested first, if its a major change ie xorg 1.6 or a diff nvidia driver version new kernel etc, it goes through ‘testing’ repo first and patches are submitted if needed.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:3, topic:290040”]Cutting-edge isn’t always a good thing, open source is all about release early, release often.  That means that every release isn’t stable, in fact most early releases aren’t stable.  I would bet that a linux distro that freshly compiled all programs in it’s distro as soon as they were released would not even be remotely usable, because the bugs in early releases would cause it to crash all the time.</p>
<p>There is a fine line to walk between cutting-edge and stable, obviously when you install debian stable you aren’t looking for a system that will be cutting-edge, but instead you want one that will be perfectly stable, and since they spent 2 years working up to the release with thousands testing it and are only doing bug and security fixes without trying anything new chances are it will be stable.  Distros like Arch have their place too, but since it is a ‘rolling release’ and they release packages when and as they feel, things have a tendency to break more and you don’t want your network or ssh breaking down when you are running a server.[/quote]<br>
Of course, the above post is correct. You’d never want to use a ‘rolling release’ distribution for a server/mission-critical operations. However, Arch’s behavior is perfectly fine for a workstation.</p>
