[center]Hello, and welcome to my newest project: War on Camelot.
The base is CruelalityX, PI/DSPK

[b]Current Staff:[/b]
Owner: TheHolyGrail
Co-Owner: ii bandos ii


There are a few reasons I am making this:
1) To meet new people and start getting myself known on Mopar.
2) For fun.
3) Learning purposes. I hope to learn a lot while working on this project.


I hope to have daily updates on this project, but that may not be possible, because I often stay at relatives houses, and they don&#39;t always have internet. I will still try to have updates as frequently as possible on this project, and please remember that I am working on this alone.

If you can try to keep this thread active and bumped with feedback and suggestions, that would be greatly appreciated.   :rolleyes:[/center]

<li>To meet new people and start getting myself known on Mopar.</li>
<li>For fun.</li>
<li>Learning purposes. I hope to learn a lot while working on this project.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope to have daily updates on this project, but that may not be possible, because I often stay at relatives houses, and they don’t always have internet. I will still try to have updates as frequently as possible on this project, and please remember that I am working on this alone.</p>
<p>If you can try to keep this thread active and bumped with feedback and suggestions, that would be greatly appreciated.   :rolleyes:[/center]</p>
