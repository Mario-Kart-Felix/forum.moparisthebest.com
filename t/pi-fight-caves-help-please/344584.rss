    <description>Hey,

Could somebody please give me some advice on where to start with re-building the fight caves on project insanity. I know that they can be glitchy. I also need to make it so that when you enter your wave is not -1. I know how to build on the array so im ok with the waves and everything. I just need to make it so that when you enter it will be 10 seconds before the wave spawms, and also make it so that when you enter your wave is not -1.


Thank you for reading</description>
