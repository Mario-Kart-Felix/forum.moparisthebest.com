    <title>Bypass the &quot;Uncategorized&quot; filter in WebSense Enterprise</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bypass-the-uncategorized-filter-in-websense-enterprise/255534</link>
    <description>My school uses WebSense Enterprise. It is such a pain because you can&#39;s download anything and half of the sites are &quot;uncategorized&quot; hence blocking them. My friend found out that for some reason PHP is handled differently. To bypass it you use the GET parameter, basically adding a /? at the end. So http://www.example.com/ becomes http://www.example.com/?. I&#39;ve used it on several websites/images at school and it actually works! I&#39;ve been to my website (works only with the /?) and downloaded CakePHP (when all downloads are blocked). This only works with Uncategorized websites and most likely not all downloads. Just don&#39;t blame me if IT comes your way  :P</description>
