We, The Atonement Development Team, strive to emulate a unique and invigorating experience for our whole communal player base. Here at Atonement we have included advanced integration among our common entities of website and server.

(the source name is different because I was originally going to switch sources, but decided to stay with the old atonement, and I haven&#39;t had the chance to update the client or the cache yet)

MEDIA:
Right now server is in Beta, so they&#39;re two modes, and it&#39;s easy to train and make money. This will change January 9th. 
We also need help, as there&#39;s much to do around the server. we currently do not have a website and are looking for a web dev.
