    <title>A few questions [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions-317/255323</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;m using the pur3 pk ftw source (v1) right now as a base. I&#39;m working on changing a couple of things, and I was wondering if somebody could tell me how to do a few things, or point me to a tutorial.

-Autocasting
-Prayer
-Defence actually working

I have actually used the search button, so no comments on that, please. I found loads of random stuff on prayer, mostly irrelevant topics. But on defence/autocasting, I couldn&#39;t find one result...</description>

<p>For the auto casting you could create a Boolean that defines if you are casting a spell or not and you could use a do-while statement to loop the casting method.</p>

<p>Well, I could probably do that, but how would I add the auto-casting interface to set the boolean to 1?</p>
<p>EDIT: Disregard what I said about being able to do that – I have no idea how to find the magic script or the interface, or where to add in a boolean value and a loop.</p>
