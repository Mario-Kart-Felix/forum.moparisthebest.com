    <title>Minecraft Fire Place Mod</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/minecraft-fire-place-mod/433187</link>
    <description>[b] Features  
[/b]
 -Single Block Fireplace: that can be lit by right clicking with flint and steel or extinguished by punching.
 -Chimney Block: that creates smoke puffs (as long as it starts right above the fireplace and continues upwards undisturbed or gets powered by redstone).
 -Firepit Block: good for contained campfires.
 -Fire Ring Block: A tiny, round, coverless cousin of the firepit.
 -Grill Block: You can grill pork, chicken, beef, or fish on it.
 -13 Materials: Brick (Item), Cobblestone, Moss Stone, Obsidian, Netherrack, Diamond, Iron Ingot, Gold Ingot, Lapis Lazuli, Sandstone, Stone Bricks, End Stone, and Nether Brick.
 -No Fire Spread: you can safely light it inside a wooden house.
 -Minecraft Forge Used: No terrain indexes are used.

The Fire Place Mod adds a single block which can act as a fire place that can be lit by flint and steel or punched to put out. The Fire Place Mod also adds chimney blocks which give off smoke to give your fire place effect. This mod also adds a grill so you can cook your food direct from your fire place. The Fire Place Mod is up to date with Minecraft 1.1 and is constantly being updated to iron out bugs and improve the Mod.

This mod is a simple feature that should be in the game, too many times we have set out wooden houses on fire either playing with lava or setting nether rack a light to get the fire place effect. Nice feature that should be in the game by default. I like the fact the Fire Place Mod adds a few more small features such as being able to cook food on the fire place.
