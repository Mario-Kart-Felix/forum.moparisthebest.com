<p>yeah, I did do some minor work. I updated the size of the client (make the camera size only 512x334), while making the frame size 700x500 (or something like that, w/e rs2 is). decided to work on some other stuff though</p>

</aside>
<p>i know this is a bump and im sorry, you might not even be here anymore,  but i wanted ask about the client width and such from camera.java.  im trying to make rsc be 1024x768. im using easyrsc source for a server and im using openrscd as a client. do you (or anyone else for that matter!) have any tips?</p>

<p>your right, just was thinking maybe if we make classic more like rs2 people would start playing again though… dunno i just was wondering… thanks anyways.  i know the world map would have to be loaded into the map…<br>

<p>don’t worry about the client   , if you want people from rs2 to play classic add stuff like rs2 into rsc</p>
<p>add<br>
all option (e.g cook all )<br>
auto fishing like in rs2 , keep clicking gives you carpel tunnel<br>
same as fishing for woodcutting<br>
move faster moving around in rsc is slow and dull<br>
add all dragon items</p>
<p>this is how you would get rs2 players into rsc</p>
<p>most of the above is why they made rs2 in the first place[/quote]<br>
That be cool with the client as well</p>
