<p>Why do you think you’d benefit PkPortalz?: The reason why I think I’d benefit PkPortalz is because I’m really good keeping things in order.</p>
<p>Why do you want this job?: As stated above, I like helping others and I love just working private servers.</p>
<p>Any additional information: I’ve been coding for about 2 years on 317’s and 508’s. I started on 562s like 8 months ago and it’s going pretty good. I set it aside though.

<p>Experience:I actually owned a few servers before and I believe I will be a perfect administrator for you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Any past work we can see or someone we can talk to to make sure?:I mostly used Ucoz and I don’t know if the people I have played with are still using the chatbox there, but if they are you can ask about me(Owner of Nightscape).</p>
<p>Will you abuse your powers if you are Admin/Mod?:I definitely will not abuse my powers. I am a very honest guy and I just want to help the server grow and the players have fun.</p>
<p>Will you complete your work and not slack off/not do your job?:Yes, I am not the type of person to slack off on anything.</p>
<p>Why do you think you’d benefit Realm of Heroes?:I can benefit Realm of Heroes in numerous ways by first of all judging by the rules, while helping new players find their way through the game.</p>
<p>Why do you want this job?:I believe that this will be a fun and great experience for me and all of us if I was to be selected.</p>
<p>Any additional information:Well I am 15 years old <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"> I play volleyball (RESPECT) I hope you will select me to be one of your administrators. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Position wanted: (Wish there was forum creator) But uhh… I will go with Ingame Admin and probably Idea man and if the Idea man doesnt turn out right then its fine</p>
<p>Experience: Didnt know there was much experience in disciplining, pretty much I just know what to do when someone comes to me about either hacks or he did this and that… Always ask for proof if there is none then I can not react on anything and another… I of course no there is no item giving unless instructed to by higher authority…</p>
<p>Any past work we can see or someone we can talk to to make sure?: (Forums - Just my mom)</p>
<p>Will you abuse your powers if you are Admin/Mod?: I have no intentions of abusing any power giving to me</p>
<p>Will you complete your work and not slack off/not do your job?: I am free almost every single and have no problem with completing anything assigned to me</p>
<p>Why do you think you’d benefit Realm of Heroes?: Hmmm maybe not me benefiting from it but me helping others realize that a real admin, takes a job seriously and will do what is necessary and most appropriate</p>
<p>Why do you want this job?: To help you by having a more intelligent Admin and to actually be the one disciplining them.</p>
<p>Any additional information: I am 18, yes the only person you will have to contact about forums work is my mom cause she has seen my previous work before everything got viruses on my computer. So now I am running on a laptop which I am available anytime anywhere I go. Just message me on my Skype and I will be able to talk and see whats going on. If you want my Skype just PM me.</p>
