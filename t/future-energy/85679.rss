    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/future-energy/85679</link>
    <description>Ok There are 4 new energy rescources that we can use instead of non-renewable objects like coal.

Ethonal
Ethonal is a plant that can be renewed into a energy source.

HydroPower
the water goes through the dam and there are turbines in there which the water will turn

Wind
Wind can make energy by the windmills powered in some farms to have, of course, energy


SolarPower
Solar panels can absorb the sunlight and turn it into energy, this can only be done when the sun is shining or out.

i want your a opinion for what will be the best energy source in the future.

My vote is the wind, It keeps going and going.</description>

              <p>Alright everyone, you all seem to have your terms mixed up. <span class="bbcode-i">Nuclear Fusion</span> is where the atoms are joined, or fused. We have yet to make this a productive energy type because it takes more energy to fuse them then the reaction gives off.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Nuclear Fission</span> is when the atoms are split and is the method currently used in nuclear power plants.</p>

<p>But in all honesty, I think solar power is the way to go judging from what whats his face said about the mirrors in the desert, heating the oil and stuff. But Id like to know how the hell would fusion be cheap? Isnt it really long/hard to get Uranium 235 or whatever it is? And for enough fusion for it to be efficient, wouldnt we need a lot of uranium?</p>

<p>I would be the whats his face.<br>
Also, uranium is a common element, approximately as common as tin or zinc, and it is a constituent of most rocks and of the sea. There is enough uranium-235 to power only 70 years at the current rate. Although, there is enough Uranium-238 to power the earth for up to 5 billion years. But, you still have to think of the waste given off. (Facts from Wikipedia)</p>

Ethonal is a plant that can be renewed into a energy source.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Ethanol isnt a plant, its the second smallest primary alcohol. and would make a good fuel for power stations and motor vehicles. However the problem is the generation of ethanol, as a biochemist i ahve done a fair bit of work on bacterial metabolisms and the like and i reckon there is a very alid bacterial solution tot he problem involving methane instead of ethanol.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Methanogenesis</span><br>
Methanogenesis or biomethanation is the formation of methane by a group of microbes known as methanogens. Organisms capable of producing methane have been identified only from the kingdom Archaea, a group phylogenetically distinct from both eukaryotes and bacteria, although many methanogenic organisms live in close association with anaerobic bacteria. The production of methane is an important and widespread form of microbial metabolism.</p>
<p>With current genetic techniques it should be able to use methanogens as a source of energy, feeding them C02 as a carbon source. i would write more on this and steal less from wikipedia but it all gets very complex very quickly.[/quote]<br>
If you have a carbureted engine, ethanol sucks. If you let it sit, it gets into the carburetor and seriously erodes the insides. With the old, better-quality gas, you could leave an engine sit for years and then fire it right up.</p>
<p>It’s so stupid that they’re making us pay more now then we did before, and we’re paying more for a worse grade of gas.</p>

Hydropower, same as above, plus the world is what - 80% or whatever water?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Nuclear Fusion-Are you guys serious? It takes 50 years before a powerplant even begins making electricity, and then you have the risks. You have to store the waste somewhere where it is not to harm the environment and stops becoming radioactive. (This could be 100 years to 1000+ years depending on the elements half-life.). And then you have to worry about plant failures, try to remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Chernobyl</a>. Trust me, you do NOT want to get radiated. The side effects are horrific. Mutations occur (as in cancer, not as in “superpowers”). And death.<br>
Any more questions?[/quote]I think you are talking about nuclear fission. I don’t think any (real) nuclear power plants use nuclear fusion yet. They are still trying to control it. In theory, nuclear fusion would be cleaner and cheaper(if research persists) than nuclear fission. (Assuming they could control it)</p>
<p>If they can ever contain it, nuclear fusion would be better overall than any form of power generation listed above.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well you can generate energy from the momentum of the vehicle but it won’t be equal to the energy used to move it in the first place. It’ll take more power to make it start moving and to stop, than the car itself can generate since it only generates energy while in motion. I read about this somewhere a while ago so I might not be exactly right but I think I am, I’ll hit up google though.</p>

<p>Hydropower, same as above, plus the world is what - 80% or whatever water?</p>

</aside>
<p>No, the earth is 2/3 water (66%). You might be confusing it with the human body which is about 80% water.</p>
<p>Nuclear Fusion-Are you guys serious? It takes 50 years before a powerplant even begins making electricity, and then you have the risks. You have to store the waste somewhere where it is not to harm the environment and stops becoming radioactive. (This could be 100 years to 1000+ years depending on the elements half-life.). And then you have to worry about plant failures, try to remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Chernobyl</a>. Trust me, you do NOT want to get radiated. The side effects are horrific. Mutations occur (as in cancer, not as in “superpowers”). And death.</p>
<p>Turbines-alright, listen up. Turbines are generators (basically). They run on the principle of Faraday’s Electro-magnetic Induction. If you have a magnet inside coiled wire and move it, electricity is produced. Wind turbines, gas generators, dams, and any other things (including coal plants, nuclear plants, and geothermal plants) produce electricity by rotating the magnets inside the wires. The question is, which way is more practical and effective?</p>
<p>Solar power is VERY expensive due to the cost of Silicon (what the panels are made of). There is also giant solar power farms in United States deserts that don’t use silicone solar panels. They use mirrors to reflect heat onto pipes filled with oil. The oil heats up and transfers its heat to water which steams up and turns turbines. This is effective because no oil is burned and it is recycled back to get heated again.</p>
<p>Any more questions?</p>

Sorry, I thought this whole theory of global warming was about saving and conserving the planet, if that means covering 90% of the damn thing in dams and wind mills then I don’t think it’s really worth it.</p>
<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention that it is more then just pissing off boaters as far as hydroelectricity is concerned, they also rape the aquatic ecosystem around them. Also wind power isn’t something I’m against per say, I just don’t like them, I could live with using their power so long as I didn’t see them and they didn’t kill so many bats, birds, and other wildlife.</p>
