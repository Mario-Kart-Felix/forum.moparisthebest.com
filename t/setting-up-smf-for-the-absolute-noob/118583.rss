    <title>Setting up SMF for the absolute noob</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-up-smf-for-the-absolute-noob/118583</link>
    <description>So you want to set up SMF huh? Well you are in luck because I have nothing else to do and I feel like helping out! XD


[center][size=16pt][u]The Basics[/u][/size][/center]

Alright first off there are two very basic and essential things you need [three if you count common sense], which are a.)[url=http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+Domain+name]Domain Name[/url] and b.)[url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=define%3A+web+hosting&amp;btnG=Search]Web hosting[/url].

 a.) A domain name is something you need to buy or you can  get a subdomain. There are many sites that you may get a domain name from just try using google.

 b.)Web hosting is the server where all of your files for your website are stored. There are many free hosts but I suggest buying host as it is usually more reliable. Some good free hosts however are: www.ulmb.com and www.xinstohost.com , there are many more that you can just google to find.

[center][size=16pt][u]Getting SMF[/u][/size][/center]

Now that you have the basics down you need to get the SMF package from their site to yours.

Open up a new tab and point your browser to www.simplemachines.org. Once the site loads click on the button on the top of the page labeled &#39;Download&#39;.
Now there are two different main ways you can go about this you can either a.)download and upload the package or you can use b.)webinstall. Generally webinstall is easier in my opinion, however I will go over both as webinstall doesn&#39;t work on every server.

 a.) [u]Manual install[/u]
   0.)Click on the download link for the correct package you are to download under &#39;Full Install&#39;. (most likely zip). Now save the file somewhere you will remember you will be using this shortly.
   1.) Now you need to log into your ftp or control panel&gt;file manager for your website, this varies from host to host so you will have to look at your host&#39;s site   for information on how to do this. Now once you are in you need to find the option to make a new folder and do it. This will be where your forums will be accessible from(I usually name it smf).
   2.) Alrighty now navigate (while still in the file manager or ftp) to the new folder you created. You must now find the option to upload a file*. If you have the option to extract compressed files automatically click it. Now find the file you just downloaded (i.e. smf_1-1-3_install.zip) and upload it. If you did not have the option of automatic extraction you must do it yourself*.
   3.)Congratulations SMF is now on your sever. It is not usable yet but if you&#39;ve made it this far you don&#39;t have too far to go still.

 b.) [u]Webinstall[/u]
   0.) Scroll down the download page to the bottom where it says &#39;Download Webinstall&#39; and click the link, save this somewhere you will remember it as you will need it soon.
   1.) Follow Step #1 from the manual install above.
   2.) Now navigate (while still in the file manager or ftp) to the new folder you created. You must now find the option to upload a file*. Now find where you just saved webinstall.php and upload it.
   3.) Congratulations you are at the point of installation.

[center][size=16pt][u]Installing SMF[/u][/size][/center]

I will break this down into sections, first as above, I will go over the a.)Manual Installation then b.)Webinstall. I will break them each down into parts as they are presented in the actual installation.

 a.)[u]Manual Installation[/u]

   1.) Basic Settings - The picture below has each part I will explain outlined in colors. The colors in order are: Red, Green, Blue, Purpleish pink.
[img]http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/8067/picsmfoo8.png[/img]
     1a.)Red. This is where you decide the name of the forums, here I left it as the default, you may change it to what you want.
     1b.)Green. This just where the forums are located, as it says this is usually correct so leave it as it is.
     1c.)Blue. This is checked as default but may not work with your host, click the hyperlink to test if it works, if it comes up as &#39;PASS&#39; then leave it checked otherwise uncheck it.
     1d.)Purpleish Pink. All of these you can leave as they are unless you know what you&#39;re doing.

   2.) MySQL Server Settings - As above this will use colors to help designate each section while I am talking about. The colors in order are: Red, Green, Purpleish pink.
[img]http://img119.imageshack.us/img119/9813/picsmf2to3.png[/img]
     2a.)Okay, before you set this part up you need to open another tab, goto your control panel and create a SQL database* named smf, or something else easy to remember. There are three things you will need to remember: database name, username, password.
     2b.)Red. This should be fine as it is, if not you may need to contact your host or look on their site.
     2c.)Green. These are the Username and Password to your database, simple enough.
     2d.)Purpleish Pink. The top one may be to be changed to equal the database name, the second one should be fine as it is unless you have another forum.

   3.) Create Your Account - As above this will use colors to help designate each section while I am talking about. The colors in order are: Red, Green,Blue, Purpleish pink.
[img]http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/4275/picsmf3lc8.png[/img]
     3a.)Red. Type the username you want.
     3b.)Green. Type your desired password.
     3c.)Blue. Type your password again.
     3d.)Purpleish Pink. Type our valid email address.

   4.) MySQL Database Password - Just retype you password for the database.

   5.) Finishing steps.
     5a.) Click Finish.
     5b.)[optional] Check the box saying: &quot;Click here to delete this install.php file now.&quot;, if this step doesn&#39;t work use your file manager to delete install.php.

   6.) Congratulations you have completed the installation of SMF onto your website! Have fun and don&#39;t forget if you found this helpful at all or need more help please post and let me know your comments.

 b.)[u]Webinstall[/u]

   1.) Open up a new tab and point your browser to where you uploaded webinstall.php (i.e. www.therealjdb.org/test2/webinstall.php).

   2.) Now there are a bunch of things that you really don&#39;t need to worry about on the first page so I am going to skip down to &#39;Your FTP connection 
information&#39;.

   3.)Your FTP connection information - The picture below has each part I will explain outlined in colors. The colors in order are: Red, Green, Blue, Purpleish pink.
[img]http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/1680/picsmf4zc9.png[/img]
    3a.)Red. This is the address of your ftp server and port, usually works so you can leave it.
    3b.)Green. This is your FTP username.
    3c.)Blue. This is your FTP password
    3d.)Purpleish Pink This is the installation path, this also should be fine, although it isn&#39;t in the above picture :P

   4.) The rest is simple so I will leave it up to you to finish the installation Good luck.

   5.) Congratulations on setting up SMF, if you found this useful and/or have any comments or suggestions please post. :)

[size=8pt]*varies according to host, check their website or contact them if you need help with this.[/size]

Yeah, unfortunately some hosts don’t work properly with web install, the best route for you is probably to use manual install or find a host that works. Sorry.</p>

              <p>By the way, Filezilla is easy as hell.</p>
<p>[quote=“MybPwnd, post:1, topic:287”]For those of you who don’t know, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is very important to you as a website owner.  You use this to upload files, delete files, edit files, ect.  In this post, I am going to teach you how to use FileZilla, an FTP client that I seem to fancy most due to its simplicity.</p>
<p>So, first off, we’re going to get it and install it.  It’s really easy, but I will save you the hassle of having to google it.  <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/filezilla/FileZilla_2_2_32_setup.exe?modtime=1176722118&amp;big_mirror=0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here</a> is the download.  After you download it, follow the installation instructions and you’ll be good.</p>
<p>After you PM’d me your information to acquire hosting, I send you some information back.  Some of this would be your FTP Username and password (Which you should have given me anyways).  Open up Filezilla.  First I will show you the easy way how to connect and a more proper way after that.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The easy way:</span><br>
See that button at the top right that says “Quick Connect”?<br>
<img src="http://pwnds.info/pictures/top.PNG" alt width="" height=""><br>
You can type the address (pwnds.info), your username and password there and just click Quick Connect and you’re connected!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The more proper way: </span><br>
Here we’ll learn how to use the Site Manager.  This is good for having multiple websites.  Lets get started.</p>
<p>Click File -&gt; Site Manager.  So, now you should be looking at the site manager.  Click on New Site down at the bottom left.  Name the site whatever you want, just as long as you’ll know what it is.  Host, again, is pwnds.info.  The Logontype is “Normal.”  Type in the username and password I gave you in the PM.  Now click Connect and you’re done!</p>
<p>Simple :]</p>
<p>I hope this helped.[/quote]</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>So you want to set up SMF huh? Well you are in luck because I have nothing else to do and I feel like helping out! XD</p>
<p>[center][size=16pt]<span class="bbcode-u">The Basics</span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>Alright first off there are two very basic and essential things you need [three if you count common sense], which are a.)<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+Domain+name" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Domain Name</a> and b.)<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=define%3A+web+hosting&amp;btnG=Search" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Web hosting</a>.</p>
<p>a.) A domain name is something you need to buy or you can  get a subdomain. There are many sites that you may get a domain name from just try using google.</p>
<p>b.)Web hosting is the server where all of your files for your website are stored. There are many free hosts but I suggest buying host as it is usually more reliable. Some good free hosts however are: <a href="http://www.ulmb.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.ulmb.com</a> and <a href="http://www.xinstohost.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.xinstohost.com</a> , there are many more that you can just google to find.</p>
<p>[center][size=16pt]<span class="bbcode-u">Getting SMF</span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>Now that you have the basics down you need to get the SMF package from their site to yours.</p>
<p>Open up a new tab and point your browser to <a href="http://www.simplemachines.org" rel="nofollow noopener">www.simplemachines.org</a>. Once the site loads click on the button on the top of the page labeled ‘Download’.<br>
Now there are two different main ways you can go about this you can either a.)download and upload the package or you can use b.)webinstall. Generally webinstall is easier in my opinion, however I will go over both as webinstall doesn’t work on every server.</p>
<p>a.) <span class="bbcode-u">Manual install</span><br>
0.)Click on the download link for the correct package you are to download under ‘Full Install’. (most likely zip). Now save the file somewhere you will remember you will be using this shortly.<br>
1.) Now you need to log into your ftp or control panel&gt;file manager for your website, this varies from host to host so you will have to look at your host’s site   for information on how to do this. Now once you are in you need to find the option to make a new folder and do it. This will be where your forums will be accessible from(I usually name it smf).<br>
2.) Alrighty now navigate (while still in the file manager or ftp) to the new folder you created. You must now find the option to upload a file*. If you have the option to extract compressed files automatically click it. Now find the file you just downloaded (i.e. smf_1-1-3_install.zip) and upload it. If you did not have the option of automatic extraction you must do it yourself*.<br>
3.)Congratulations SMF is now on your sever. It is not usable yet but if you’ve made it this far you don’t have too far to go still.</p>
<p>b.) <span class="bbcode-u">Webinstall</span><br>
0.) Scroll down the download page to the bottom where it says ‘Download Webinstall’ and click the link, save this somewhere you will remember it as you will need it soon.<br>
1.) Follow Step <span class="hashtag">#1</span> from the manual install above.<br>
2.) Now navigate (while still in the file manager or ftp) to the new folder you created. You must now find the option to upload a file*. Now find where you just saved webinstall.php and upload it.<br>
3.) Congratulations you are at the point of installation.</p>
<p>[center][size=16pt]<span class="bbcode-u">Installing SMF</span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>I will break this down into sections, first as above, I will go over the a.)Manual Installation then b.)Webinstall. I will break them each down into parts as they are presented in the actual installation.</p>
<p>a.)<span class="bbcode-u">Manual Installation</span></p>
<p>1.) Basic Settings - The picture below has each part I will explain outlined in colors. The colors in order are: Red, Green, Blue, Purpleish pink.<br>
<img src="http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/8067/picsmfoo8.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
1a.)Red. This is where you decide the name of the forums, here I left it as the default, you may change it to what you want.<br>
1b.)Green. This just where the forums are located, as it says this is usually correct so leave it as it is.<br>
1c.)Blue. This is checked as default but may not work with your host, click the hyperlink to test if it works, if it comes up as ‘PASS’ then leave it checked otherwise uncheck it.<br>
1d.)Purpleish Pink. All of these you can leave as they are unless you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p>2.) MySQL Server Settings - As above this will use colors to help designate each section while I am talking about. The colors in order are: Red, Green, Purpleish pink.<br>

2a.)Okay, before you set this part up you need to open another tab, goto your control panel and create a SQL database* named smf, or something else easy to remember. There are three things you will need to remember: database name, username, password.<br>
2b.)Red. This should be fine as it is, if not you may need to contact your host or look on their site.<br>
2c.)Green. These are the Username and Password to your database, simple enough.<br>
2d.)Purpleish Pink. The top one may be to be changed to equal the database name, the second one should be fine as it is unless you have another forum.</p>
<p>3.) Create Your Account - As above this will use colors to help designate each section while I am talking about. The colors in order are: Red, Green,Blue, Purpleish pink.<br>
<img src="http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/4275/picsmf3lc8.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
3a.)Red. Type the username you want.<br>
3b.)Green. Type your desired password.<br>
3c.)Blue. Type your password again.<br>
3d.)Purpleish Pink. Type our valid email address.</p>
<p>4.) MySQL Database Password - Just retype you password for the database.</p>
<p>5.) Finishing steps.<br>
5a.) Click Finish.<br>
5b.)[optional] Check the box saying: “Click here to delete this install.php file now.”, if this step doesn’t work use your file manager to delete install.php.</p>
<p>6.) Congratulations you have completed the installation of SMF onto your website! Have fun and don’t forget if you found this helpful at all or need more help please post and let me know your comments.</p>
<p>b.)<span class="bbcode-u">Webinstall</span></p>
<p>1.) Open up a new tab and point your browser to where you uploaded webinstall.php (i.e. <a href="http://www.therealjdb.org/test2/webinstall.php" rel="nofollow noopener">www.therealjdb.org/test2/webinstall.php</a>).</p>
<p>2.) Now there are a bunch of things that you really don’t need to worry about on the first page so I am going to skip down to ‘Your FTP connection<br>
information’.</p>
<p>3.)Your FTP connection information - The picture below has each part I will explain outlined in colors. The colors in order are: Red, Green, Blue, Purpleish pink.<br>
<img src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/1680/picsmf4zc9.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
3a.)Red. This is the address of your ftp server and port, usually works so you can leave it.<br>
3b.)Green. This is your FTP username.<br>
3c.)Blue. This is your FTP password<br>
3d.)Purpleish Pink This is the installation path, this also should be fine, although it isn’t in the above picture <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>4.) The rest is simple so I will leave it up to you to finish the installation Good luck.</p>
<p>5.) Congratulations on setting up SMF, if you found this useful and/or have any comments or suggestions please post. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
