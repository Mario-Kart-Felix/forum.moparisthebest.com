    <title>Sell your climbing boots</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sell-your-climbing-boots/345610</link>
    <description>...and make millions. Jagex recently changed the 12gp climbing boots into 75k (45k alching value) Rock Climbing Boots. Players can alch the boots for 45k each, resulting in millions. I had a few clanmates who had over 2,000 of these things.

2,000 x 45,000 = 90,000,000

The prices of items will skyrocket now because of the fact that in one day billions of gold is going to be pumped into items such as Bandos armor, Dragon Claws, Godswords, etc.

Here is the forum article 2 hours after the update was created...:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi all, 

We have recently made some changes to the price of climbing boots in the game, and changed the objects gained at the end of the Death Plateau quest to reflect these changes. 

The recent change to the climbing boots was necessary to make: they weren’t designed well and did not fit in with the high standards we have regarding our equipment and prices. There are always thousands of accounts trying to buy these boots on the GE and very few trying to sell them, because they had low shop prices and complications to obtain in the first place. Rather than ‘nerf’ the boots or force players to buy other boots, we decided to raise the market price of the boots to reflect the price that players were actually paying in player-to-player trades. They also reflect the market price of other strength-boosting equipment. 

We do not intend to rollback this change. 

We researched this solution thoroughly before making the change. We knew that a few accounts would gain millions of gold from these changes. A tiny number of accounts had over 1000 of these boots, and have made a lot of cash in a very short period of time. Realistically, these accounts have always had the potential to make that sort of cash from the boots (based on what we know players were trading for outside of the GE), we have just made it easier for them to do so. 

We made the call to allow everyone to benefit from this change, rather than for people to suffer from it as a nerf would have done. I am sorry if you feel you have suffered because you didn’t own any, but this is a short-term issue and is truly not as extreme as some individuals are making out.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rather than ‘nerf’ the boots or force players to buy other boots, we decided to raise the market price of the boots to reflect the price that players were actually paying in player-to-player trades.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is probably the biggest lie of the whole article. The max trade that a climbing boots set rarely passed 5k.

Not to sound like a picky prick here buddy but you don’t have 750k. 100 X 75,000 = 7.5M.</p>

              <p>…and make millions. Jagex recently changed the 12gp climbing boots into 75k (45k alching value) Rock Climbing Boots. Players can alch the boots for 45k each, resulting in millions. I had a few clanmates who had over 2,000 of these things.</p>
<p>2,000 x 45,000 = 90,000,000</p>
<p>The prices of items will skyrocket now because of the fact that in one day billions of gold is going to be pumped into items such as Bandos armor, Dragon Claws, Godswords, etc.</p>
<p>Here is the forum article 2 hours after the update was created…:</p>
<blockquote>Hi all, 
<p>We have recently made some changes to the price of climbing boots in the game, and changed the objects gained at the end of the Death Plateau quest to reflect these changes.</p>
<p>The recent change to the climbing boots was necessary to make: they weren’t designed well and did not fit in with the high standards we have regarding our equipment and prices. There are always thousands of accounts trying to buy these boots on the GE and very few trying to sell them, because they had low shop prices and complications to obtain in the first place. Rather than ‘nerf’ the boots or force players to buy other boots, we decided to raise the market price of the boots to reflect the price that players were actually paying in player-to-player trades. They also reflect the market price of other strength-boosting equipment.</p>
<p>We do not intend to rollback this change.</p>
<p>We researched this solution thoroughly before making the change. We knew that a few accounts would gain millions of gold from these changes. A tiny number of accounts had over 1000 of these boots, and have made a lot of cash in a very short period of time. Realistically, these accounts have always had the potential to make that sort of cash from the boots (based on what we know players were trading for outside of the GE), we have just made it easier for them to do so.</p>
<p>We made the call to allow everyone to benefit from this change, rather than for people to suffer from it as a nerf would have done. I am sorry if you feel you have suffered because you didn’t own any, but this is a short-term issue and is truly not as extreme as some individuals are making out.</p>

<p>This is probably the biggest lie of the whole article. The max trade that a climbing boots set rarely passed 5k.</p>
