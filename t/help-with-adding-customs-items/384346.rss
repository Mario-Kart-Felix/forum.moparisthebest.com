    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-adding-customs-items/384346</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve gone to about 4343543 different tutorials now trying to add Chaotic weapons to my server, and it just seems not to work at all.

If someone could please help me through Team Viewer that would be great.</description>
