    <description>What is up everybody?

Here&#39;s the deal,
Gaming on a mobile phone/smart phone has become more and more popular.

So what&#39;s the easiest way to develop applications and even games for android?
My solution: [b]Flash[/b]

Flash Professional is an animation software, and, as most of you know, you can develop games with it.

But what most of you do not know, is Adobe AIR. 
Adobe AIR for Android &amp; iOS can be used to develop applications. Now without a jailbroken iphone, you can only test your applications with emulators. However, if you own an android phone and you want to test your application/game, you can just connect it to your pc, allow apps from unknown publishers and publish it to your phone.

I myself am not a professional or skilled developer in (actually anything..) Actionscript 3 (AS3), but I did make something I&#39;d like to show you guys.

I&#39;ve been developping a Snake Arcade from scratch and this is basically what flash&#39;s interface looks like (changed it up a bit, it&#39;s fully customizable).

So basically, what I wanted was a simple snake game - I wanted a snake that moves and picks up fruit, and everytime it picks up the fruit, it grows.

So for myself, I had found two ways to do this. 
1. Detect colission between the fruit and the snake.
2. Detect when the snake is exactly the same height and width as the object it &#39;picks up&#39;.

I went for option two because I didn&#39;t know exactly how collision works, and I&#39;m using a (invisible) grid anyway.

So yeah, once I had the snake, This -&gt; [IMG]http://i48.tinypic.com/f0zxtx.jpg[/img] I needed a stage setup. First off, I had a very big border which contained four buttons. I really hated it and it was very hard to play on a mobile phone, and even harder to play on an emulator.

This is what it looked like:

I really didn&#39;t like it, and then it hit me. [b]Onscreen controls[/b]!

I would [u]increase[/u] the size of the gameframe and it would be easier to play. It was the [i]perfect solution[/i].

So I messed around a lot and I had a solution to make it: [i]invisible [/i]or [i]transperent [/i][b]buttons[/b].
Firstly I had a setup like this:
[IMG]http://i49.tinypic.com/168xzk2.jpg[/img]

At this point I let some friends test it. They said it was good and all, but together we found out what was wrong with it, and what would be better.
We figured that if the controls moved with the snake, it would be way easier to control.

The basic idea is that when you tap above the snake, it goes up. Under the snake - down, etc. instead of having to tap in a particular area which is unclear.

I made my own debugging system that looked like this:

*A recreation of what it looked like, ofcourse itdidn&#39;t work the flawlessly the first time*

It took some time to get it right, but when I took off the debugging I had this nice control system.



So.. I had the controls done but if you died (hit yourself or the outside of the screen) - nothing would happen. We needed a gameover screen - So I designed one.

Using twitter&#39;s API, I was able to figure out I could make a link send a message without having to authorize or anything.
Twitter&#39;s Button Doc. https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-button

It works as follows - I have my variables and a share url. Then I complete every part of the share url with my own (adjusted by the players) variables.

I did the same for Digg and facebook.

After those elements, I had made a nice designed menu and a controls and credits tab. Where the controls are explained again.

This is still[u] under development [/u]- the settings tab needs to be made, for example - [i]difficulties, game modes, control setups, etc.[/i]

[size=18pt][b]Please give me your opinion. I hope you liked it and I hope I&#39;ve shown you how powerful Flash can be.
