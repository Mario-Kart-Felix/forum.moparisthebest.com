    <description>That&#39;s right, I&#39;m going to start giving a damn about you people.
Post your questions here, I&#39;ll answer them as soon as I feel the need.
Go on, do it.

By the way, read this sticky. This is what not to ask.
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,59918.0.html

Read this too. Pre-answered questions.
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,56932.0.html

Those are the questions that I&#39;m not going to bother to answer. Look through that before you ask here, because you&#39;ll find the answers there.</description>

<p>Firstly, declare this:</p>

<p>Then search for boolean process() {<br>
Under that line, put:</p>
<p><code>if(plantTimer &gt; 0) {

<p>That will take 1 away from the value of plantTimer every half a second - so it minuses 2 from the value of plantTimer each second.<br>
Work from there on your own. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Ok, go to start, and select run. In run, type ‘cmd’, without the ’ (quotation marks). Once the command prompt window comes up, type ‘ipconfig’, once again, don’t include the ’ quotation marks.</p>
<p>Once you type that, it will come up with something that looks like this:</p>
<p>Windows IP Configuration<br>
Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection:<br>
Connection-specific DNS Suffix:<br>
IP Address… :192.168.1.10<br>
Subnet Mask… :255.255.255.0<br>
Default Gateway… :192.168.1.1</p>
<p>Now when it comes up with that, you need the number that appears next to Default Gateway - That is the internal IP address of your router. Once you get that number, open either Firefox or Internet Explorer, and put it in the address bar - then hit enter.</p>
<p>From there, you should be in your router’s configuration area. Grab your router’s manual and go from there. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I reckon eh. The rules need to change - Firstly, in the part that they type ‘yes’, the rules need to state that you are to read AND follow specific forum section rules. Secondly, the rules need to state that failure to comply with those rules will result in an instant 2 day ban. Now that is what would clean this place up.[/quote]</p>
<p>Your sig also shows what this place is full of.Well at least that guy was able to admit it,Usually admitting is always the hardest part :).</p>

<p>Heh, you know the server can’t just discard bytes like that you know? Like, a 57 could mean that the user used an item on an NPC, or it could also be the index of the player they are trying to attack. Each byte of information has to be considered contextually.[/quote]<br>
I know. But if the particular byte <em>is</em> for an item being used on an NPC, shouldn’t it still catch the exception in that particular case?</p>
