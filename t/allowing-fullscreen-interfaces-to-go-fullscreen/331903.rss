    <title>Allowing &#39;fullscreen&#39; interfaces to &#39;go-fullscreen&#39;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/allowing-fullscreen-interfaces-to-go-fullscreen/331903</link>
    <description>Okay, I&#39;m (trying) to use interface 15244 (the welcome screen) and this is what happens:
http://i1041.photobucket.com/albums/b418/AfterLifeLochie/Server%20Development/problem.png

Is there any way to hide the lower and rightmost panels to allow the interface to show, or, is there another way to do it?

Thanks in advance.</description>

              <p>The welcome screen has its own frame, 176.</p>
<p>Read through the packet data and this is what I was able to come up with</p>
<p><code>	public void sendFrame176(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e) {
		outStream.createFrame(176);
		outStream.writeByteC(a);
		outStream.writeWordA(b);
		outStream.writeByte(c);
		outStream.writeDWord(d);
		outStream.writeWord(e);
	}</code><br>
int d in this case can not be equal to 0, and the current shown interface has to be -1.</p>
<p>Still playing with it but that’s what I was able to find at this point.</p>
