    <title>The protests in Libya</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-protests-in-libya/384488</link>
    <description>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12604760

Gaddafi, today, denied that any protests in the Libyan capital ever happened. 

This guy should be removed. It&#39;s clear that rapid change is happening across North Africa and the Middle East and to me he seems like a power hungry dictator is trying to prove to the world that he is still in charge. 

I&#39;m completely for the revolutions that are happening, and I just wish that these ignorant leaders would listen to the people that kept them in control of their regimes.</description>

<p>You talk like you think he’s in a house and they’ll knock on the door  at 4am and take him out. This guy is going to be guarded, Gaddafi’s led a dictatorship for a long fucking time, something tells me his personal security is probably quite fucking impressive.

<p>Special forces get caught all the time without public knowledge, they’re also out on operations that we’ll never know about. They also die all the time because half the missions they go on are suicidal. Special forces soldiers are fucking awesome but they’re going up against incredible odds.  Bravo two zero in an OKish BBC film that tries to demonstrate a mission going wrong but there are far better documentaries with real accounts from these kinds of soldiers (although they’ll never give specific details, they will literally just tell you they’ve been caught and how they were tortured never where, when or why.) You could torture one of these guys for months and they’d never tell you a thing.</p>

You seem to imply that “taking him out”, even if it wasn’t ridiculous, wouldn’t cause death in the streets.<br>

<p>Are you saying since the special unit is American theyll go in there guns blazin and shoot everyone and report back that Gaddafi is probably dead?</p>

The difference between countries like America and everyone else (Britain, Australia, New Zealand) is that America is prepared to act unilaterally.</p>
<p>Australia could send in a team that is just as capable as the Navy SEALs – we have an SAS regiment who are just as highly trained. So does Britain, New Zealand and numerous European countries, so there’s no shortage of special forces units in the Western world that could go in and put this dictator down overnight.<br>
The difference is that no Australian politicians have the balls to make such a move.</p>

Pretty sure that the USA has already called for Khadaffi to step down, and condemned him for hurting civilians.<br>

<p>I’m not talking about just the US this time. The whole Western world has benefited from these dictators (not only Khadaffi). Khadaffi owns a big oil company in the Netherlands, and Royal Dutch Shell is, as the name suggests, partially Dutch. Shell is a big oil company in Libya, Nigeria (a different story, but same principal) and pretty much everywhere else.</p>

<p>Maybe the people of the countries should have revolted 30 years ago?</p>
<p>edit:<br>
Just heard Khadaffi said that thousands of his own people will die if UN or US forces attempt to enforce a no fly zone.  Seems like a good enough reason to me to do it and help the people.  Hopefully someone kills that nut.</p>
