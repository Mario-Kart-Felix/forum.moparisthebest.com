&lt;blockquote&gt;The ice sheath splash has finally melted, it&#39;s now official, and while I&#39;m not exactly barreled over by the announcement because I&#39;ve always felt a trifle conflicted about the merits of the Diablo series, I&#39;m definitely intrigued.

What I (and plenty of others) speculated might happen came to pass at approximately 12:18 p.m. on June 28th at the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational in Paris, France, where Blizzard finally confirmed that yes, Diablo 3 is in the works, eight prolonged years after Diablo 2, and over a decade after the original gave oceans of relentless finger-tappers a conduit for their compulsion.

Don&#39;t believe me? Peep the the Blizzard homepage Flash splash (if you can get it to come up once folks on this side of the pond start to rise and shine).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
