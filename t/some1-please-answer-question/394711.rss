    <description>OK i know this isnt supose to be in server help but i didnt see a good section to put this in.

Question: When i deltete and uninstall stuff on my computer to free up space and make faster does it start going faster right away or do i need to restart computer after deleting?

P.s: In my defence in kinda invalves servers cause i deleted lots of source + servers i use to play and im doing so, so that my computer will run fast as i can make it run before puting my server online again.</description>
