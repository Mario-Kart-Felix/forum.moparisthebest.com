    <description>Im having a hard time figuring out what to do here.
 I ATTEMPTED adding d claws into the PI source but im a little confused on where to put the .dat models because I put them in a raw folder and still nothing. Should I be putting the raw folder some where else? or what? Iv follow many tuts where people say do add model in game but that doesnt work if someone can just shoot a quick reply at me on where to put the .dat models so it will appear in my client.
thanks</description>
