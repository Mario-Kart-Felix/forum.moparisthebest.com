EDIT: http://www.theastralworld.com/prophecies/babavanga.php &lt;-- Better info

&lt;blockquote&gt;2011: As a result of the war, radioactive showers will destroy almost all life in the Northern Hemisphere. The remaining Europeans will face an even further threat from the Muslims who will use chemical weapons to finish them off.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Read 2011, look at us today (2011)

&lt;blockquote&gt;if multiple reactors exploded would look like war wouldnt it. and the resulting radiation could appear as a weapon from the war ?
think how visons/ prophecys are like in a 3rd person view you just see key events happen. and baba probably doesnt understand anything about nuclear type stuff.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notice the wars in the arabian country, the radioactive thing in Japan that i just heard on the news is possible to destroy all the plants. It kind of matches the prediction and no, it&#39;s not a fake. Look at the date uploaded + those predictions were posted on alot of places.

Who is she?
&lt;blockquote&gt;Baba Vanga is credited with foretelling many future events that have already happened. During the earlier years, it is said that her older brother, Vasil, had joined the army and was ready to go to war. Baba Vanga cried and begged him not to go as he would die at the age of 23. Despite the warning, her brother left and eventually surrendered to the Germans who tortured and later executed him. She is believed to have predicted the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Chernobyl disaster, the death of Princess Diana, Boris Yeltsin&#39;s electoral victory and the date of Stalin&#39;s death but I can&#39;t find the original prophecies to verify these. Over the years, she was visited by many political leaders, including Adolph Hitler. Always the one to turn away bad people after exposing their hidden secrets, Hitler was seen leaving Baba Vanga&#39;s house in a bad mood. Had she booted him with harsh words or just told him a future he didn&#39;t want to hear I haven&#39;t found.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also something i found regarding 2012, she said something WILL happen then but it&#39;s not going to be the end of the world.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Vanga, Baba Vanga, the Bulgarian clairvoyant and prophet, prophesies foretold prophecies, predictions for 2012, doomsday, who is the beginning of a bright future, peace and prosperity. Second Coming will come as it is written, everything will be done. It will be a peacemaker ˝ ˝ born to east, which will sign the eternal peace on earth. New energy, super-fast trains, a grouping of religions with a common goal, humanity will believe a doctrine, God is one for all, selfishness will disappear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Used Google translator, there may be bad grammar and some stuff may not be understandable.

Looks like she strongly believed in God and i&#39;ve read in future we might have contact possibly with Him and His other living beings.

Interesting..
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;After 2000 there will be no catastrophes, nor flood. While waiting for our 1000 years of peace and prosperity. Ordinary men will travel to other worlds at a rate ten times greater than the light as it travels by bus. This will happen no more earlier than 2050. &quot; This clearly shows that masayah figure or Lord of the Second Coming has already been born on earth. After 2000 his influence in the world will be strengthened, but after 2010 it will really change the direction of the world to peace. In her words it will become possible due to the tremendous support that he will receive from the saints in the spiritual world and the Holy Spirit. [b]But if humanity did not follow his conduct, warns Vanga, we expect nuclear warrior after 2010 If this happens the vast majority of the population will be deleted, and in the Northern Hemisphere will disappear all plant and animal species.[/b] Interesting that Nastradamus warns of possible war and destruction, but his words he strongly hopes that humanity will be realized and then it will not happen. All clear down to whether to follow the conduct of new Mesayah person or ne.vanga, Baba Vanga, Vanga prophecy, predictions of Vanga, Baba Vanga&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Now, after you&#39;ve read this quote, look above some quotes above it at the comment where the guy says &quot;It may not be exactly a nuclear war, she may have seen the plant explosion&quot;

These have not been written like last year or something, it&#39;s all quotes of what she said alot of years ago, there are even archive videos. Also, there are still some bulgarian websites with [b]full sentances[/b] of what she says through all those years, you may find it hard to believe because people simply shortened them and made them to the point of what will happen that year.</description>

<p>Also they said that her prediction came true, nuclear radiation, danger of animals and plants dieing (this 1 also was said on the news, cause the radioactive gas thing could hit the core and cause that), also a few years later i think i’ve read something about world hunger (I’m guessing that’s when animals and plants will be destroyed. No bread, no meat, etc…)</p>

              <p>[quote=“xryz, post:26, topic:386451”]<span class="mention">@ytuio9</span> to me it seems like u know nothing on mayans, and if you did you are not making it known.</p>
<p>“In common with the other Mesoamerican civilizations, the Maya used a base 20 (vigesimal) and base 5 numbering system (see Maya numerals). Also, the preclassic Maya and their neighbors independently <span class="bbcode-b">developed the concept of zero</span> by 36 BC. Inscriptions show them on occasion working with sums up to the hundreds of millions and dates so large it would take several lines just to represent it. They produced extremely accurate astronomical observations; their charts of the movements of the moon and planets are equal or superior to those of any other civilization working from naked eye observation.[citation needed]<br>
In common with the other Mesoamerican civilizations, the Maya had measured the length of the solar year to a high degree of accuracy, far more accurately than that used in Europe as the basis of the Gregorian Calendar. They did not use this figure for the length of year in their calendars, however; the calendars they used were crude, being based on a year length of exactly 365 days, which means that the calendar falls out of step with the seasons by one day every four years. By comparison, the Julian calendar, used in Europe from Roman times until about the 16th Century, accumulated an error of only one day every 128 years. The modern Gregorian calendar is even more accurate, accumulating only a day’s error in approximately 3257 years.” - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization#Mathematics" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization#Mathematics</a>[/quote]<br>
How is that relevant to my point? What does the concept of zero have anything to do with what I was saying?</p>

But you can take a lot of data, analyze it, and conclude that there is not reasoning for the end to be in the next 1000 years(ok 1000 my be a long shot but like you said 6000 years what’s another 1000? I mean there is billions of years before the sun will die, which btw I would assume that the earth would be uninhabited). I wish ppl would use their brains b4 posting.</p>

              <p><span class="mention">@ytuio9</span> to me it seems like u know nothing on mayans, and if you did you are not making it known.</p>
<p>“In common with the other Mesoamerican civilizations, the Maya used a base 20 (vigesimal) and base 5 numbering system (see Maya numerals). Also, the preclassic Maya and their neighbors independently <span class="bbcode-b">developed the concept of zero</span> by 36 BC. Inscriptions show them on occasion working with sums up to the hundreds of millions and dates so large it would take several lines just to represent it. They produced extremely accurate astronomical observations; their charts of the movements of the moon and planets are equal or superior to those of any other civilization working from naked eye observation.[citation needed]<br>
In common with the other Mesoamerican civilizations, the Maya had measured the length of the solar year to a high degree of accuracy, far more accurately than that used in Europe as the basis of the Gregorian Calendar. They did not use this figure for the length of year in their calendars, however; the calendars they used were crude, being based on a year length of exactly 365 days, which means that the calendar falls out of step with the seasons by one day every four years. By comparison, the Julian calendar, used in Europe from Roman times until about the 16th Century, accumulated an error of only one day every 128 years. The modern Gregorian calendar is even more accurate, accumulating only a day’s error in approximately 3257 years.” - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization#Mathematics" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization#Mathematics</a></p>

A: Just as the calendar you have on your kitchen wall does not cease to exist after December 31, the Mayan calendar does not cease to exist on December 21, 2012. This date is the end of the Mayan long-count period but then – just as your calendar begins again on January 1 – another long-count period begins for the Mayan calendar.</p>

<p>logically it makes since and im pretty sure they mayans had had some logic. its a cycle so if it repeats why try to extend it when thats the end just like nasa gave as an example that the gregorian calendar that most ppl use ends on december 31 every year. its not like its a numbering system, its a way to keep track of time…[/quote]<br>
You say the Mayans had some logic, yet they had a cycle worth 2012 years? O.O</p>

It’s logical really, and with all due respect to anyone reading this, it’s alway a religious nut too focused on faith that makes up these stories.</p>
<p>It used to worry me, but then I made my own mind up about things and realised nothing’s going to happen. It’s just like every other predicted death dates.</p>
<p>There are strange things with numbers that add up and make dates etc., but this is because of patterns. The human brain always finds patterns amongst noise, this is why we see shapes in clouds; it’s the way our brains are naturally programmed to be.</p>
