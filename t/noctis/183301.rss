    <description>Yet another game from me...
This is not a conventional game, but rather, a galaxy for you to explore, thats about 2mb big. Another cool thing about it is that it doesn&#39;t have to be open to be progressing, so I could scope for fuel before going to school and turn my computer on after wards and other things would have progressed. It goes real time, but using the Felisian clock, which is:

1 second [triads Dexter]
16 &amp; 2/3 minutes [triads Medius]
1.5 weeks [triads Sinister]
~31.71 years [Epoc]
