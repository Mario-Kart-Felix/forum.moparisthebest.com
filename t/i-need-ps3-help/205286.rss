    <title>I need PS3 Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-ps3-help/205286</link>
    <description>

Now recently my PS3 has broken and a game stuck inside and i get repeated flashing red lights. So i called up Sony and they said they are going to get it replaced by Friday but for the disc i have to wait a month, an example of incompetance but not my main issue beleive me, now this is bad because it is indeed my favourite game so i am mega pissed and then i asked about my memory &#39;you can transfer it to your computer by a memory stick&#39; says the person WHAT GOOD IS THAT WHEN I CAN&#39;T TURN THE DAMN THING ON?  So i asked what if i take out the hardrive and put that in the replacement PS3? The courier won&#39;t then do the deal, which is understandable so i asked whast if i replace it with a new hardrive? &#39;i am not authorized to answer that question&#39; how ridiculous is that? so they toddled off to talk to a manager and i wasn&#39;t aloud to talk to the manager because apparently they were busy. I then asked would that work they said the playstation will ask you to update the hardrive and the data will just be wiped anyway so its useless. Possibly that may be true for the playstation because of its settings but what if i put the hardrive into my computer and load it up from there so i can view it &#39;won&#39;t work&#39; they reply, i asked why and all i got was &#39;it just won&#39;t work&#39; Now that is ridiculous because i have lost £15 worth of things from PSN store and 1.5 years of data now understandably i am annoyed at this person and&#39;they can&#39;t offer any advice. I do not beleive that taking the hardrive out and replacing it elsewhere will cause the hardrive to be wiped, i can do that with any hardrive from any other form of electronic device even a smoothie maker(why a smoothie maker has a hardrive i don&#39;t know it just does) so why not the PS3? I need that data retreived from there and i am going to continue to harass sony until i can get some form of a response from them I am pissed off on a huge scale now, i mean monolithically. What&#39;s even worse is once they take my PS3 away its just going to go to a factory where they WIPE the hardrive. Now anyone who understands an iota about a computer will tell you that the data is stored on the hardrive and can be removed if accessed so why the (SWEAR WORD) can i not get the data from my PS3 hardrive? I am looking up some schematics on the internet to get some help and if its possible i will do it. If any one has any help or suggestions they can offer please do</description>

I’m talking about taking the console apart, i know that sony purposely made it so you can replace the hard drive and even explain how to change it in the manual.</p>

When your ps3 breaks or any ps (2/psp) breaks they send a refurbished one with a courier so you do the swap for your broken one for the refurbished one so you don’t wait weeks and weeks for a replacement. Plus there is only around a 3% failure rate on the ps3s as there is around a 33% on xbox 360 (Last time i saw it on bbc news about it).<br>

              <p>[Quote]Recently my PS3 broke and a game got stuck inside. I called up Sony and they told me they will replace it by Friday but I will have to wait a month for the disc. This is not my main issue but still incompetence on their part.<br>
This sucks because my favourite game Battletoads is stuck in there.<br>
I then asked; “What about the stuff on my PS3 hard drive?”<br>
Sony – “You can transfer it to your computer by memory stick”</p>
<p>What good is that when I cannot turn the PS3 on? I then asked if I could take the hard drive out and put that into the replacement PS3. I was then told that the courier wouldn’t take the PS3 then. I then asked if I could replace the broken PS3’s hard drive with a new one, and keep the old one with memory on it.</p>
<p>Sony – “I am not authorized to answer that question”</p>
<p>How stupid is that? They went and talked with the manager and would not let me talk to him because he was “Busy”.</p>
<p>I then asked if it would even work to take the hard drive out and put it into another PS3 and apparently not as it will tell you to update the hard drive and the data will be lost. I then asked if I could put the PS3 hard drive in to my computer and view it from there but I was told; “Won’t work”. I asked why and all they said was “It won’t work”.</p>
<pre><code>I find that ridiculous because I have lost £15 worth of things from PSN store and 1.5 years of data. I am quite annoyed at this person and they cannot offer any advice. I believe that what he said about taking the hard drive out and it being wiped was true because I can do this with any other electronic device. Some shit about a Smoothie maker. 

I need the data retrieved. They will probably wipe the data when I send them my PS3. Is there some way I can retrieve the data from my PS3 hard drive? Any suggestions?

<p>tl;dr My PS3 is broken and I need a way to recover the data from the hard drive.<br>

<p>Well I tried making it more read-able but I don’t think I succeeded. I’m not sure what I can suggest. I guess just ring up Sony and explain your problem more thoroughly.</p>
