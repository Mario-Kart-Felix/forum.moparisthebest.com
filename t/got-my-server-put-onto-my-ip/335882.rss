    <title>Got my server put onto my Ip</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/got-my-server-put-onto-my-ip/335882</link>
    <description>So i got it put on my ip as several guides had instructed, no errors loading up the server. But when I go to log in I get the error, [Java] Java.net.connectException: Connection refused: connect. I&#39;ve done everything by the guide not sure if this is something on my half like maby security settings or firewall maby?

ACCIDENTLY, posted this in the wrong forrum. If any forum mods see would you mind moving it for me?</description>
