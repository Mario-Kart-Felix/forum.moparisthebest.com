    <title>[298]Walking when clicked on minimap</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/298-walking-when-clicked-on-minimap/548007</link>
    <description>I have downloaded a blank 289 Hyperion that is completely blank besides the fact it has (most) packets. Now when I click on the actual screen the player will walk there, however, when I click on the mini-map somewhere it won&#39;t walk to that point. 

Anybody got a solution? I&#39;m not too good with the concept of walking and how clicking on the mini-map is different from the actual screen...

If you for some reason need pictures for more explanation, ask.</description>
