    <description>hi im currently making the sequel to Raplezscape v1, Servious Scape. And i dont want to just add anything that i think of, i want YOUR ideas as the players of the server, what do you want and need? Whats more popular than the rest? What do u seek in a private server? Well im gonna try me best to add what you guys like (Posters of ideas will be availible to beta testing(hamachi &lt;--- Not forwarded yet). I will post a list of ideas underneath updating it every now and then also will be updating my progress, thanks. fuck me... 100 errors and i dont even remember what i did.... fuck...

[center][color=blue]IDEAS:

- None (0% Complete)


What I Am Working On:

- Throwing Weapons (80% Complete, Thinking of way to delete 1 of weapon, Rest Done) &lt;--- On Pause
- New Training Area (90%, Bascily Done)


What I Have Done:

- Farcasting To Bows
- Walk through desert to change to ancient spells
- Added 2 desert camps with fully walking NPC&#39;s
- Karils Uses Kbolts
- Perfect dummies, trains exactly like monsters. (Adding max skill to train 20)
- Scorpians in Al-Kharid
- Al-Kharid palace fully walking &#39;Al-Kharid Warriors&#39;
- Crystal Bow Minigame Complete (Aggressive Monsters!)
- Range Bonus Decides On HitDiff With Bows!!!!!
- Perfect Eating! (NO GLITCHES!)
- Making Teleports Random Coords
- Added Ghostly Robes Minigame( Hide and Seek! &lt;-- Lol )
- Tele to shanty, then walk to pyramid for ancients.
- And much much more.


Currently online.

Well i am currently coding but if you would like a sneek peek at what i am doing &lt;--- MAJOR GOODNESS!
I will host it on a hamachi server.... Not no-ip because i cbf port forwarding just got new routers... 3 of them lol. Also if i host hamachi mabe less people will play xD. COME AND TRY IT OUT! :P Also ill be happy to give u admin or w/e for beta testing seeing im like restarting basicly from scratch and there isnt much. Only for testing tho
Hamachi Network:
Beta Test SS
Hamachi Password:
I disabled password but if u need its - 123</description>

<p>Umm couldn’t you look in a source with range (and the arrows actually go down) and learn off of how they decrease the amount of arrows u have weilded.  Just an idea though.</p>
