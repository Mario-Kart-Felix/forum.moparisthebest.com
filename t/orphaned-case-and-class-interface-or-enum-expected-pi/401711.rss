    <description>I was trying to add player shops to my source today and I came across these errors,

[code]src\server\model\players\packets\BankX2.java:59: orphaned case
                        case 5382:
                        ^
src\server\model\players\packets\BankX2.java:81: class, interface, or enum expec
ted
}→
^
2 errors
Press any key to continue . . .[/code] 

I&#39;ve looked in the common compiler errors page and I&#39;ve looked them up on Google and the Moparscape search bar was used also.. any help from the community?

Thanks in advance
