    <description>Sorry if there&#39;s a thread on this, I looked around and looked at all the stickies. I haven&#39;t touched RuneScape in...three years? All my posts that were on here have long since been deleted, and I haven&#39;t even played with Java since then.

Basically, last time I was here, CheezScape was one of the most common servers. I&#39;m looking to set up a new one (not a base, something already mostly done.)

What&#39;s with all the 500+ versions? What are the differences? And which ones are most completed?
I don&#39;t really need pvp/clan wars/etc. I just want something for just me to play alone.

Thanks for not flaming.</description>

              <p>well 499- would be different items then 500+ and thats a bad thing… but! the 500+ r way harder to code! i sugjest doing 317 in the beggining and then after u masterd it going to 508-562, 508 is a lil easier but not as much items and interfaces as 562. i have just started on a 562! gl! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Hmm, thanks guys. Any specific differences between 508/562? I’m basically looking for something with all skills/quests working, but highest version possible. I only know basic java. Minigames/pvp don’t matter to me.</p>
