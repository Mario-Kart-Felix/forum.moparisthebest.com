    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-need-a-walkthrough-over-skype/437717</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to make my client to where i can send it to a few of my friends so we can play it.
I have a source and a client.
I made a no-ip and a port foward.
I add my no ip to my client and convert it to a .rar and send it to them yet when they have it they cant connect to server?
Btw its a insidiax base i believe.</description>
