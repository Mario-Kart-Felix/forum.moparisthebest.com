    <description>It really irritates me the level of negligence people have when designing/coding website templates. Unlike  many other languages, things may work in one place and not in another in web design. Let me reiterate; your website will display differently depending on:

Doctype
Screen resolution
Device
CSS code


So, the purpose of this thread is the following: Let me introduce you to some sh*t that you should have learned on your first day.


[b]Doctype:[/b]

The minimal doctype required is &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; not &lt;html&gt;. If you don&#39;t have a doctyp your browser will go into quirks mode and things will display weird.


[b]508 Compliance &amp; Accessibility:[/b]

Make sure your website can be used by the disabled. Some people may be def and using &lt;b&gt; instead of &lt;strong&gt; will not get your point across. Read up more [url=http://viget.com/inspire/a-designers-guide-to-accessibility-and-508-compliance]here[/url] 

[b]The Difference Between A Class and An ID:[/b]

Look at the phrases: Class and ID. Think about them, what is a class? What is an ID? CORRECT! Classes can be used multiple times one the same page, whereas an ID should only be used once per page.

[b]Opac Images:[/b]

Stop wasting your time. Images are a thing of the past. This goes for double borders, etc.

[code]
rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
[/code]

Will display opac black. Ding Ding.


:TODO:

I just got off work so I will be adding to this. I just worked a 16 hour shift so if I sound retarded I probably am.</description>

You didn’t really explain classes and IDs as clearly as should be done. There’s no actual, hmmm, how do you say… Like, knowledge to it, you just say “this is for this, and that is for that.”.</p>
<p>Let’s think more logically into the situation. And ID is usually given to one thing.  That is how you identify that specific item. A class, you could think describes a group of things. You sort things amongst classes.  While you were not incorrect, you leave someone to think " why?" And explaining that why allows people to retain the information more easily since there is some logic for them to base it from.<br>

<p>I think his explanation was a bit simpler than yours, ableit both made sense xD</p>
<p>Id = identifier (unique, think <span class="hashtag">#country-list</span>, <span class="hashtag">#nav-menu</span>)</p>
<p>An ID would be a unique name for an element that you only have 1 of, each element has it’s own name and doesn’t share it with any other element. <span class="hashtag">#london</span> isn’t <span class="hashtag">#sanfrancisco</span>, <span class="hashtag">#london</span> is <span class="hashtag">#london</span>.</p>
<p>Class = classification (groups, elements that need to be referred to as a group)</p>
<p>Classes would be name for a group, for example the elements with ID’s <span class="hashtag">#london</span> and <span class="hashtag">#sanfrancisco</span> both can all have the class .city so in our css we can set a rule for all cities, instead of writing each ID out.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>And yeah, he obviously meant opaque. Which is supported as far back as IE9, which isn’t very far still. To say images (in place of css rules, rounded corners/opacity etc) is a thing of the past is pushing it a bit, maybe not for our intended audiences but definitely for production sites.[/quote]he didn’t explain anything though.  And then you went even further lol</p>
