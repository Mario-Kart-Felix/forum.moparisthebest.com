    <description>hello
well i have a problem. I was trying to pass a dynamic array well i figured out its impossible to make a dynamic array without pointers. Like for example

int pos = 4;
int size = 27+(pos/2);
char Test[size];    &lt;- that will give compiler error saying it has to be a const.

so well I did it by the book with pointers

char* Test= (char*) malloc (size);
or javaish like
char* Test = new char[size];

anyways I can&#39;t figure out how to do a sizeof() on a pointer array?? cuz everytime I do it the return is always the same 4.. as in address length so I dont know what to do without saving the size of it in another int  but I don&#39;t want to do that because I want to pass it to a header file to be processed by another function so in this case there is no way that other function will know the size of the array this is being ran on a _beginthread so it could mess up if size is in a bad delay with the array.

anyway to get size of dynamic array without saving it to a variable? ye i googled the problem  can&#39;t find anything I don&#39;t im searching google for my problem correctly. k..</description>

              <p>sizeof() is kinda a compile time thing. if you want to get the length of the array, you’re going to have to do something else.<br>
using a vector would be nice, but thats C++, not C.</p>

              <p>if holding onto the length of an array separately is too much a hassle for you, you could always make your own struct</p>
<p>maybe something like</p>
<p><code>typedef struct
{
  size_t length;
  void* data;
} arrrrrrrrrrray;</code></p>

              <p>There is no built-in way of obtaining the size of a dynamic array.<br>
If your function takes a dynamic array as a parameter, you will also need to pass it the length as a different parameter.</p>
<p>However, using dynamic arrays and passing them around is usually not the best idea, unless there is no alternative (due to real and proven speed requirements or interfacing with a C API)</p>
<p>It is important to realize that C and C++ are different languages. If you were really using C, you wouldn’t be able to allocate memory through new[] because it is a C++ operator. And if you are using C++ (And you seem to be) you should avoid malloc, and restrain yourself from using pointers or op. new if there is an alternative.</p>
<p>In your case you should most likely use a std::string, or an std::vector.</p>
<p>Internally, a vector is basically just like a dynamic array which also contains a variable with its own length.</p>
<p>Edit: *If the string is null terminated you can obtain the length by iterating through (or which is the same, using legacy function strlen) it till you find the null character. Obviously, this is not only inefficient (as it requires linear time), but unsafe, as if there is no null character the buffer will overflow and the program’s behaviour will be undefined.</p>
