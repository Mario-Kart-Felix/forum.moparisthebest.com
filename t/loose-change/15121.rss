<p>How does a plane go through several layers of the pentagon and make a hole bigger than that of which it entered?</p>
<p>I just farted.</p>

<p>Yes, but most of it is BS, For example: It is obvious that a plane crashed into the Pentagon. By making up shit like that, it makes people think that the rest of the video is shit, but their is some truth to it. I do believe that it was terrorists. However, Bush knew about it, but he chose to do nothing about it, realizing he could take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>Just my opinion.</p>
<p>P.S. I don’t live in the U.S. or Iraq, or Afghanastan, so my opinion isn’t biased.</p>
