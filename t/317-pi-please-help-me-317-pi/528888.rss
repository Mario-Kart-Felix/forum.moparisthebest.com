    <description>Now i feel stupid for asking this, this is typically something a beginner coder would ask, not to sure but i can&#39;t seem to figure this problem out.

Ok, Now when i load my RSPS client, The loading bar appears (of course) but when it is finished loading, and it goes to my login box, the loading bar is right behind it meaning you can still see the edges of the loading bar, what im trying to get to here, I want to make my loading bar disappear after it has finished loading 100% so people wont see it when they log in could someone help?

If you want to talk on Skype add me &quot; twistedrh &quot;

Thanks!</description>
