Welcome to the official RuneGnosis thread! We recently bought a vB license, and wanted to make something big, not as usual. What are we about?

&lt;blockquote&gt;I&#39;ve had a thought set in my head for quite sometime now to create a website solely for Runescape Private Server Tutorials\Help. My present idea on what I want RuneGnosis to be is as following: The one stop place where you can find virtually any tutorial that you may need that fits your expertise, (beginner, intermediate, expert), and revision.

First of all, I don&#39;t think I have ever seen any website within the RSPS realm that offered specifically what I am offering/trying to do, (if you want to split hairs and shout out that these RSPS communities do just the same, then go ahead, but it&#39;s not exactly right), and another thing: RuneGnosis will be the father of audio tutorials. 

The audio tutorials that RuneGnosis will be offering you is every tutorial. I will be implementing, or have someone help me implement (most likely this one), javascript audio players that will play specific sections of tutorial in the runegnosis staff/voice over artists&#39; own voice. It won&#39;t be as cut and dry as it seems, I have ideas to have special players that will play the voice over artists own comments &amp; tips on that specific section of tutorial, or the tutorial in whole so you the reader could get a better grasp of it.

Some of you may ask what the point of integrating audio into tutorials is, and simply put: If you hear it, you may understand it better. Yeah, this sounds kind of bumfucky, but I sincerely think the way I have carefully planned to attack this will be beneficial to the reader of the tutorials because of the audio and text integration/.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the way, posting an image that includes a build failure seems like a really bad way to try and get people to play your game.
