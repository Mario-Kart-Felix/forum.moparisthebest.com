    <title>Reading lines in text file</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reading-lines-in-text-file/446019</link>
    <description>im adding a few things to my server that require 2 different things

1. a line of code to write numbers to a text file (i think i have this i found by looking at ::report command)

2. and a line of code to read numbers from the text file (i need help with this)

basically i want to use  a command to turn a item into 2 numbers (the item id and the item amount) separated by a space so it would look like this if i opened the text file

1048 100


and to be able to use another command to turn the numbers (the item and amount) from the text file back into items in game this is not exactly what im going to do on my server so don&#39;t say just use the ::item command or ::pickup btw the server is a pi source

oh just thought of it i dont really need it but i will probably be back asking for help on this later if no one gives it to me now

some code to force the line reading code to read a certain line line 2 line 5 line 8 etc...

i wouldn&#39;t even be asking its just ive never seen this before or done it before so i have no idea how to make this</description>
