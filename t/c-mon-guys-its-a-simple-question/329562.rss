    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/c-mon-guys-its-a-simple-question/329562</link>
    <description>i just started my first 562 server and i need to know how to change the ips of a 562 client...

I only found 1 ip in the client.java and i changed that, but its still connecting to my localhost

So were would i find the other ips? there is no egui or gui so where are they?

Please post anything even if its just a random guess...</description>
