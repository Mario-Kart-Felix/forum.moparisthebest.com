Yup, you read right. 
You have a chance to host a world on TobiasScape,
for more info, click  [url=http://www.tobiasscape.com/play/page.html]here[/url]
but you don&#39;t really have to because i&#39;ve quoted it all below incase people think im advertising!

&lt;blockquote&gt;Interested in hosting a server for us?
Please add support.tobias9@hotmail.com to your MSN contacts, or email me at the same address.
Job Info: You can choose the update day, you will be given admin in game, the IP must be 
tobiasscape[world_number].no-ip.org, you will get a free open-source copy of my server,
you may get your picture on the banner depending on the quality of your service and,
you must be able to host a no-ip server at least 10/5, I can check.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ok, basically all im saying there is theese are the requirements+terms:

[ul][li]You choose the update day[/li]
[li]you will be given/offered admin in game[/li]
[li]The IP must be 
tobiasscape[world_number].no-ip.org[/li]
[li]You will get a free open-source copy of my server[/li]
[li]You may get your picture on the banner depending on the quality of your service[/li]
[li]You must be able to host a no-ip server at least 10/5, I can check[/li][/ul]


As for the lagg state, I don&#39;t mind as long as it&#39;s not too bad with 60 people playing, the better it is, the more people will play it and the better your service becomes.

On the 30th of march, 2008, TobiasScape&#39;s world one had over 350 people playing within an hour of it being released.
