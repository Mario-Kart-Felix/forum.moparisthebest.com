    <title>Weird problem with loading models</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weird-problem-with-loading-models/546055</link>
    <description>So me and my buddy have been working on a pi except we decided we wanted to add some npcs and models. There&#39;s no file in the cache to add models to and there&#39;s custom npcs already but we can&#39;t find there model location. There&#39;s is a model.idx (I thinks that&#39;s the file) would anyone be willing to help with this.</description>
