    <description>My Friend was killing guards in falador yesterday, Trying for the new clue scrolls, When some level 87 attacked him, Yes, A player, My friend got speced for 2 30&#39;s with the dude using a dds then the guy finished him with a d-long, Do you think this could be something to do with the &quot;old&quot; Autorune Crew?

Post Comments Please, This is very intresting.

              <p>There was a bug that allowed you to attack people outside of the wilderness. I am aware of how it was done. You would go to non multi wilderness and telly to duel arena/c wars, and you could still attack people. It sounds stupid that no-one spotted it. But it’s true - it worked. Me and a few friends worked with it but my friends account got banned (Half thanks to me as I used the bug loads on his acc ^_^)</p>

              <p>You moron . . . you said it in the text</p>
<p>“I can’t actually attack people”</p>
<p>The reason you have the attack option is because during lag, the client misses the update packets</p>
<p>(They will be buffered, then the buffer will be flushed but the contents don’t get to the event queue)</p>
<p>So the client never deletes the command option “Attack”. Thats no glitch, thats just a result of your shitty shitty crap crap of a computer.</p>
<p>And by the way, your cropping skills suck ass.</p>

Oh, and incase you still don’t understand, idiot, I was “lawling” at your post. Then, after I put the “break” I started talking about Jake’s post. So before you go talking shit, as I said earlier, read the post more clearly. Cause right now, you just made yourself look like a fucking idiot.</p>
<p>“noobowned” What a faggot.<br>

<p>How bout you read the post yourself?  It’s quite understandable for him to take offense.  I think everyone who read your post understood it as you trying to diss davidude.  Think before you flame, cuz you make yourself look like a faggot.[/quote]<br>

First of all, idiot, speak with some proper grammar. I think the only people that can clearly understand what you are saying are other fags that don’t know how to type correctly. (Note how I said “other” fags, which means I’m including you, queer)<br>
Secondly, idiot, I know exactly what the “fuck” you are talking about, dumbass. I’m saying that just because he, Jake MC, said that he saw someone kill his “friend” out of wildy doesn’t mean it’s true. So read the other post more clearly before you go making yourself look like a dumbfuck.</p>
