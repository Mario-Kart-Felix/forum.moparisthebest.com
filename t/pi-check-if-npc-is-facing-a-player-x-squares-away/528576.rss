    <title>PI - Check if NPC is facing a player X squares away?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-check-if-npc-is-facing-a-player-x-squares-away/528576</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve never really played with anything NPC related, and I would like to know if there is any way you could make the npc check the distance between it and a player. Then check if it&#39;s facing player.
Example (not real) code:
[code=java]
public boolean checkDistanceToPlayer(Player plr, int distance){
if(plr.x &lt;= 2 npc.x){//if player x and npc x are within 2 squares, this also needs to check if there&#39;s an object (I have server sided clipping using region clipping.
if(npc.face(plr)){//if npc can see player (Fake)
return true;
}//End 1
}//End 2, there&#39;d be an else statement to check for Y or what ever..
else{
return false;
}
}//End Boolean
[/code]</description>
