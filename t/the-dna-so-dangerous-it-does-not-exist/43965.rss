&lt;blockquote&gt;The DNA so dangerous it does not exist

Could there be forbidden sequences in the genome - ones so harmful that they are not compatible with life? One group of researchers thinks so. Unlike most genome sequencing projects which set out to search for genes that are conserved within and between species, their goal is to identify &quot;primes&quot;: DNA sequences and chains of amino acids so dangerous to life that they do not exist.

&quot;It&#39;s like looking for a needle that&#39;s not actually in the haystack,&quot; says Greg Hampikian, professor of genetics at Boise State University in Idaho, who is leading the project. &quot;There must be some DNA or protein sequences that are not compatible with life, perhaps because they bind some essential cellular component, for example, and have therefore been selected out of circulation. There may also be some that are lethal in some species, but not others. We&#39;re looking for those sequences.&quot;

To do this, Hampikian and his colleage Tim Anderson, also at Boise, have developed software that calculates all the possible sequences of nucleotides - the &quot;letters&quot; of DNA - up to a certain length, and then scans sequence databases such as the US National Institutes of Health&#39;s Genbank to identify the smallest sequences that aren&#39;t present. Those that don&#39;t occur in one species but do in others are termed &quot;nullomers&quot;, while those that aren&#39;t found in any species are termed primes.

Hampikian&#39;s team is deliberately searching for the shortest absent sequences in order to minimise the possibility that absent sequences are missing simply due to chance. So far they have found 86 sequences of 11 nucleotides long that have never been reported in humans.

They have also identified more than 60,000 primes of 15 nucleotides in length and 746 protein &quot;peptoprime&quot; strings of five amino acids that have never been reported in any species. &quot;These represent the largest possible set of lethal sequences,&quot; says Hampikian, who expects the numbers to shrink as more sequence information is added to the database. He is presenting his results at the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing in Maui, Hawaii, this week.

Whether these sequences have any biological significance in living organisms is not yet known - the next step is to test 20 of the peptoprimes in bacteria and human cells to see whether they have any effect such as causing death or provoking an immune reaction.

Hampikian believes the applications of his work could be wide-ranging. He has already received a $1 million grant from the US Department of Defense to develop a DNA &quot;safety tag&quot; that could be added to voluntary DNA reference samples in criminal cases to distinguish them from forensic samples. Such tags would not necessarily have to consist of lethal sequences, but could be based on primes that would be easy to detect using a simple kit.

Further down the line there is the possibility of constructing a &quot;suicide gene&quot; to code for deadly amino acid primes. It could be attached to genetically modified organisms and activated to destroy them at a later date if they turned out to be dangerous, Hampikian suggests.

Well unless the DNA sequence were to create some sort of killer protein that destroyed certain parts of the cell, I don’t see why some would be incompatible with all life.  Viruses like SARS and bacteria that cause anthrax are different though…viruses inject DNA or RNA into a host cell that have the capabilities of self-reproduction, not necessarily killing the host cell directly in this process.  Bacteria are living organisms, so obviously they don’t compare.  Obviously these guys have done a lot more research, but it just doesn’t seem to realistic to me.<br>

<p>They don’t have to be compatible with anything. For example, remember when all of the birds from certain Asian countries had diseases? Didn’t that produce SARS in humans? I can’t remember if it was the SARS issue or not, but the only two biological related scares I can think of were the anthrax (the real anthrax attacks paired with the hoaxes), and the SARS issue (You may or may not have seen footage of everyone in China or some place like that wearing masks to prevent inhalation of the disease).<br>
Obviously that strand of DNA that the virus added to humans and animals caused the vital systems to function incorrectly, potentially causing death. As the name suggests, it was quite severe and acute, attacking the respiratory system.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s not that DNA isn’t compatible with life; it’s that certain combinations aren’t compatible. I seriously doubt whether the original poster completely understands all of that… He’d have to be <em>at least</em> studying a senior level of biology and physics to fully comprehend the meaning of all of it - Personally, I finished my Year 10 science with a very good result, and elements of that are still meaningless to me. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> On another note, there have been plenty of biological weapons. For example, those of you who have seen Saw 2 will remember Sarin being mentioned. Sarin was one of the four nerve agents created by Germany scientists back in WW1 or WW2, along with Cyclosarin etc. Then there was the V series of nerve agents, which are even more deadly.<br>
So basically, I doubt this will be used as a weapon as people already have enough of those.</p>

<p>Could there be forbidden sequences in the genome - ones so harmful that they are not compatible with life? One group of researchers thinks so. Unlike most genome sequencing projects which set out to search for genes that are conserved within and between species, their goal is to identify “primes”: DNA sequences and chains of amino acids so dangerous to life that they do not exist.</p>
<p>“It’s like looking for a needle that’s not actually in the haystack,” says Greg Hampikian, professor of genetics at Boise State University in Idaho, who is leading the project. “There must be some DNA or protein sequences that are not compatible with life, perhaps because they bind some essential cellular component, for example, and have therefore been selected out of circulation. There may also be some that are lethal in some species, but not others. We’re looking for those sequences.”</p>
<p>To do this, Hampikian and his colleage Tim Anderson, also at Boise, have developed software that calculates all the possible sequences of nucleotides - the “letters” of DNA - up to a certain length, and then scans sequence databases such as the US National Institutes of Health’s Genbank to identify the smallest sequences that aren’t present. Those that don’t occur in one species but do in others are termed “nullomers”, while those that aren’t found in any species are termed primes.</p>
<p>Hampikian’s team is deliberately searching for the shortest absent sequences in order to minimise the possibility that absent sequences are missing simply due to chance. So far they have found 86 sequences of 11 nucleotides long that have never been reported in humans.</p>
<p>They have also identified more than 60,000 primes of 15 nucleotides in length and 746 protein “peptoprime” strings of five amino acids that have never been reported in any species. “These represent the largest possible set of lethal sequences,” says Hampikian, who expects the numbers to shrink as more sequence information is added to the database. He is presenting his results at the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing in Maui, Hawaii, this week.</p>
<p>Whether these sequences have any biological significance in living organisms is not yet known - the next step is to test 20 of the peptoprimes in bacteria and human cells to see whether they have any effect such as causing death or provoking an immune reaction.</p>
<p>Hampikian believes the applications of his work could be wide-ranging. He has already received a $1 million grant from the US Department of Defense to develop a DNA “safety tag” that could be added to voluntary DNA reference samples in criminal cases to distinguish them from forensic samples. Such tags would not necessarily have to consist of lethal sequences, but could be based on primes that would be easy to detect using a simple kit.</p>
<p>Further down the line there is the possibility of constructing a “suicide gene” to code for deadly amino acid primes. It could be attached to genetically modified organisms and activated to destroy them at a later date if they turned out to be dangerous, Hampikian suggests.<br>
