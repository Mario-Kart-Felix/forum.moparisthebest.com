              <p>well here is my 718/737 code list with 2 owners…Just change Ben &amp; Christian to your 2 owner names.<br>
Warning: If you get any error’s its not my fault. The bases could have different coding. Make a backup!<br>

Note: There are some commands like ::npc (id) (amount) that only u can do…If you want to make it so that the 2nd owner can do it as well add this to the end: (player.getUsername().equalsIgnoreCase(“ben”) || player.getUsername().equalsIgnoreCase(“christian”))) {</p>
