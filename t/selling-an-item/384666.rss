Well my General store like doesent let me sell any items in it at all :\ lol

I went to my Shopassistant class and looked at my general store id and it says config Item sellable so i added some items like 536 to see if that would work and i still get the same problem :\...

Any1 know how  i can change it so i can ssell any items ?</description>
