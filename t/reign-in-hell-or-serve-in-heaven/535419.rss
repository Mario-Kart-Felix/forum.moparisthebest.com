<p>You make it sound like serving for heaven would be a punishment, because it wouldn’t. It’s a custom for a servant of God to do as they are told, somewhat similar to culture. If we’re basing this topic of myth and not religion (in which I really hope so, though, I don’t see a difference between the two) then what are the tasks given to an angel serving in heaven?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not supposed to be religious, I don’t think. I read this question from some thread a while back on Reddit. I think the question is trying to find out if you’d rather lead something as awful as hell to possibly something better, or comfortably serve in heaven.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Oh okay. I expected something a bit more challenging to think about. Not some question you’d find in a Disney cartoon. No offence.</p>
<p>There’s a reason why Hell supposedly exist. It’s a balance between the good and the evil like Yin and Yang or in this case, Michael and Lucifer. I assume when you say “lead something as awful as hell to possibly something better,” doesn’t really make sense. This sort of stuff really has no well done answer to it considering that stories of Lucifer say that he is a leader of hell, some say that hell isn’t run by anything because Lucifer is locked up in some cage or hole that Michael put him it. But if it was one way then you’d probably wont even get a chance to lead hell with Lucifer around.</p>
<p>I really have no clue. It kind of seems I’m putting to much thought into a simple question. Or maybe I’m just being a bit to closed minded about this subject? I really need to stop watching Supernatural…</p>
<p>You know what. Stuff it. I’ll play along. I would lead hell into something better. Why? Because The Bible is full of shit and everything is a sin these days. I would simply testify against heaven who sends innocent souls into hell.</p>
<p>I really do know very little about the bible so if I called out anything that is completely wrong or insulting then I very do much apologize.[/quote]</p>
<p>You could lead hell just the way it is too if you wish. You literally become Satan. You can choose to do good or stay evil. What’s gonna happen, gonna go to hell? LOL</p>

You make it sound like serving for heaven would be a punishment, because it wouldn’t. It’s a custom for a servant of God to do as they are told, somewhat similar to culture. If we’re basing this topic of myth and not religion (in which I really hope so, though, I don’t see a difference between the two) then what are the tasks given to an angel serving in heaven?<br>

<p>Not supposed to be religious, I don’t think. I read this question from some thread a while back on Reddit. I think the question is trying to find out if you’d rather lead something as awful as hell to possibly something better, or comfortably serve in heaven.[/quote]<br>
Oh okay. I expected something a bit more challenging to think about. Not some question you’d find in a Disney cartoon. No offence.</p>
<p>There’s a reason why Hell supposedly exist. It’s a balance between the good and the evil like Yin and Yang or in this case, Michael and Lucifer. I assume when you say “lead something as awful as hell to possibly something better,” doesn’t really make sense. This sort of stuff really has no well done answer to it considering that stories of Lucifer say that he is a leader of hell, some say that hell isn’t run by anything because Lucifer is locked up in some cage or hole that Michael put him it. But if it was one way then you’d probably wont even get a chance to lead hell with Lucifer around.</p>
<p>I really have no clue. It kind of seems I’m putting to much thought into a simple question. Or maybe I’m just being a bit to closed minded about this subject? I really need to stop watching Supernatural…</p>
<p>You know what. Stuff it. I’ll play along. I would lead hell into something better. Why? Because The Bible is full of shit and everything is a sin these days. I would simply testify against heaven who sends innocent souls into hell.</p>
<p>I really do know very little about the bible so if I called out anything that is completely wrong or insulting then I very do much apologize.</p>
