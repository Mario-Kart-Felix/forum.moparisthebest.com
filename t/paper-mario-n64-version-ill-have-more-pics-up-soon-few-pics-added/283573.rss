    <description>[size=30pt][center]Paper Mario, N64. (Lobbiescape 5)![/center][/size]

Okay, i wanted to tell everyone about my soon to be best server ive ever made. First off, Portals do work, and you will get partners (bombette, koops ect) except im not sure on how to make em follow you but ill work on that, Also im going to work on making your character look like Mario (which is going to be VERY HARD!!! I might not even be able to make it :( )
Alright. I have a few pictures sent over here so heres a starting picture
[img]http://i40.tinypic.com/2l9s20g.jpg[/img]
Thats what pops up when you log in. so you close it, click on the exit door, and then you teleport to Toad Town (Varrock with nothing in it except my new state of the art houses) Then another menu pops up, with directions. go north through the big doors to get to the castle, go through and youll see the castle is gone. Blah blah blah and then when you go through the doors, another note will pop up. Blahblahblah... and then you start playing the adventure! When you beat the game, you will be able to do anything that any other servers have, Pking, godwars, everything!!! Once you finish the game, you will NEVER be able to go back, this is to prevent you giving money to people in the game
[b]FEATURES
Real working tele&#39;s and codes
Real partners
Real money (low amount)
Real hammers
Real Star Wand with gfx
almost real items
(NOTE, this is only on client, will take very long for it to be released publicly)[/b]
Please dont give me any nagging comments, like these.
&quot;Oh this is 100% leached&quot;
Really... Have you seen a server like this???
&quot;Oh it looks like it takes too long to finish story&quot;
Well yes it does kinda
&quot;Oh your thing is copywrited and it will get sued&quot;
No, like i said, it is not the same (mines different looking, alot!)
Like i said... Leave me a comment!
