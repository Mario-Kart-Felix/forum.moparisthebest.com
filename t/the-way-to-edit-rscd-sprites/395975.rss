    <description>RSCD Sprite Editor Download: (Requires 7zip to extract)

Copy your sprites.rscd file to the RSCD Sprite Editor folder.

Unpack your sprites.rscd file with run_unpacker.bat

Copy 1339.spr from RSCD Sprite Editor/unpack/dat/ to RSCD Sprite Editor/unpack/

Edit RSCD Sprite Editor/src/spriteeditor/SpritePacker.java

Replace:
[code]public static String NEW_DIR = &quot;./sprites/&quot;;[/code]

With:
[code]public static String NEW_DIR = &quot;./unpack/&quot;;[/code]

(This is my personal preference for the unpack folder)

Run Compile.bat

Run the run_editor.bat and click the Load Sprite button. Select 1339.spr from the RSCD Sprite Editor/unpack/ folder.

Look at the bottom bar and make a notepad text file containing the values it gives.

Package, ID, Shift, X-Shift, Y-Shift, Width-2, and Height-2 are all that you need to write down.

Click the Save Image button and save the new sprite image to the RSCD Sprite Editor/unpack/ folder.

**Make sure you append .PNG to the end of the file name.**

Quit the sprite editor and open up your image editing program. I use Paint.Net as its free and just as good as Photoshop in most areas.

Edit the sprite PNG file from the RSCD Sprite Editor/unpack/ folder as you wish and save it.

Open run_editor.bat and click the Load Image button. Navigate to the RSCD Sprite Editor/unpack/ folder.

Normally you should be able to edit the bottom bar fields with the information you saved on your notepad text file from before but for whatever reason, it does not save it to your .spr sprite file.

Click the Save Sprite button and navigate to your RSCD Sprite Editor/unpack/ folder. Save your sprite as 1339.spr and always make sure you append .spr to the end of the new sprite file name. If you don&#39;t, the sprite packer will not see it.

Navigate to RSCD Sprite Editor/unpack/ and open 1339.spr with 7zip. It is a tar.gz archive, just like the .rscd files from your client cache are.

Extract the 1339 file (no file type) to your desktop and open it with notepad++ or wordpad. (Not regular notepad as that doesn&#39;t show the lines correctly and bunches it up into unreadable text)

You will notice this is an XML file. Scroll to the very bottom to where it reads:
[code]&lt;width&gt;321&lt;/width&gt;
  &lt;height&gt;163&lt;/height&gt;
  &lt;packageName&gt;unknown&lt;/packageName&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;-1&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;requiresShift&gt;false&lt;/requiresShift&gt;
  &lt;xShift&gt;0&lt;/xShift&gt;
  &lt;yShift&gt;0&lt;/yShift&gt;
  &lt;width2&gt;0&lt;/width2&gt;
  &lt;height2&gt;0&lt;/height2&gt;
&lt;/spriteeditor.Sprite&gt;[/code]

You want to ignore the first width and height lines. Where it reads packageName, delete the word &quot;unknown&quot; if your sprite editor had a blank in that box before. For the rest, fill it out exactly as you wrote down on your notepad text file. When finished, save the XML file and drag it back into the 7zip file manager to update the compressed XML file inside the 1339.spr archive.

Navigate to RSCD Sprite Editor/ and open the run_packer.bat file. Select your Sprites.rscd file and click Open.

It should only pack the 1339.spr as that is what is sitting in the RSCD Sprite Editor/unpack/ folder. Beware of images that are too large, such as a background for a client. If it is too large, it will crash the sprite packer.

Note: if you paint a sprite with the same shade of black that is in the background of the sprite, whatever you paint black will become transparent.

The overlay function in the sprite editor is neat to play with but does not save any colors to the sprite.</description>

              <p>So complicated, when you could just edit a PNG and save it as .spr with all the settings(Package, ID, Shift, X-Shift, Y-Shift, Width-2, and Height-2). And you can improve the editor to do all this for you.</p>
