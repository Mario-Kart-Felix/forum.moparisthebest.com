So here is the text feel free to edit as needed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Babymaking - Not just a skill, but a way of RSPS.

[hr]

After the defeat of Elvarg at your hands all the lands in &lt;insertservernamehere&gt; have drawn nearer to each other. They have settled down from panic mode and are now returning to their normal daily lives.

Two cities though aren&#39;t... the gnomes and the royal elves. These two groups have been feuding for many centuries now...yet they don&#39;t even remember why they were feuding!

You, the adventurer&lt;insertnamehere&gt; must overcome the vast and dangerous journey of bringing these two countries to a calming peace or the total west side of &lt;insertservernamehere&gt; could be in turmoil quite soon.

&lt;insertquestdialogue/storylinehere&gt;

[hr]

So after the quest you are &quot;forced&quot; to choose a side and wed one of the leaders from either the gnomes/elves royal daughter. (I chose gnomes personally just cause I have a midget fetish xD....)

Unknowingly to everybody gnomes/elves and humans fertile wise is crazy fertile! Not only does it enhance the time for pregnancy but it also brings about great strengths for both the parents and the child. 

The children while growing up are &quot;taught&quot; how to woodcut/smith/mine/and etc throughout their life. When your child reaches a certain maturity level aka babymaking level you can assign them to do &quot;chores&quot; or in this case resource gathering. 

Just like us regular dirty humans we can&#39;t stay with just one woman though! We have to be free yo! So yeah anyway, the misses gets mad cause you are never at home and &quot;don&#39;t love her enough&quot; so she moves back to her now enraged parents house(gnome tree ~^ ) and you must raise your child on your own. BACHELORS PAD WOO.

There is more but you get the gist of it :p&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
