    <title>[REQ] Someone that has SOME creativeness [REQ]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-someone-that-has-some-creativeness-req/9836</link>
    <description>First, please don&#39;t close this, I&#39;m just trying to get some ideas cause im really bored...

And yes, I&#39;m back to private servers.

Alright, what I need here: someone the opposite of me.

Me = no ceativeness
what I&#39;m looking for = someone that can give me some freaking ideas

I&#39;m sitting here bored as anything...

When I get some idea I&#39;ll make a tut on it.
I&#39;ll explain it so that they can do more later on, I won&#39;t just do it for them.

Well? anyone?</description>
