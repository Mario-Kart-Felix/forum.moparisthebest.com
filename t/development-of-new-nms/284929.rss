Welcome to the development thread for Project Zynna. The project is mainly aiming on bringing back old RS and making it funner, and more enjoyable for players. Now the question is, why would we want to go back to old rs?  That&#39;s because we want to bring back the fun of pking without all the new items in RS that ruined it. We will be perfecting every inch of the server, in every way making it more stable, and more enjoyable, but at the same time a very simple server.

[U][B]The Coding Team[/B][/U]
[I]We have three, very good coders for the server.[/I]

[B]Mr Danny[/B] - Forum coder.

[B]Zynna[/B] - Forum coder and server coder.

[B]Nightmare[/B] - Client coder and server coder.

[U][B]Goals[/B][/U]

- Making a fun and enjoyable server for everyone (pkers, skillers, ect.)
- All skills funny working 100%
- Perfect pking
- Many Minigames that are fun.
- Removing bandos, armadyl, d boots, godswords, that ruined pk.
- Having a good, balanced economy.

[U][B]Skills[/B][/U]

Cooking - 100%
Woodcutting - 100%
Fletching - 100%
Fishing - 80%
Firemaking - 100%
Crafting - 90%
Smithing - 30%
Mining - 90%
Herblore - 20%
Agility - 80%
Theiving - 70%
Slayer - 70%
Farming[/B] - 100%
Runecrafting - 70%
[U][B]Economy[/B][/U]
The economy of Zynna will be a very great and stable economy. I hate servers that start you off with 50m or 100m so the starter will be small, enough for you to buy your training equipment and food.  There will be stalls but they will not give alot of money and they will give different items depending at which stall you are at.

[U][B]Minigames[/B][/U]
There will be many minigames added such as improved pest control, fight pits, better barrows, ect..

[U][B]Player Killing[/B][/U]
Player killing will have perfected specials, improved timing and whatnot.

[U][B]Items[/B][/U]
There will be many items being released on the game. There will be alot of useless items that you can obtain from drops but also good ones. You will be able to obtain equipment from monster drops (stronger monster, better equipment) and you may be able to get a rare item from a stall. Also, we are removing the stupid godswords, dragon claws, bandos, and customs that ruin the fun of pk.

[U][B]Shops[/B][/U]
Shops will sort of be like RS. There will be only the necessary equipment needed. There will be a range store with arrows up to mithril, and bows up to willow, the rest you will need to fletch yourself and there will be other shops.

[U][B]Updates[/B][/U]
- [I]Completed Forums[/I]
- [I]Completed Highscorebard[/I]
- [I]Finished Client[/I]
- [I]Added fishing, skill training area[/I]
- [I]Added starter[/I]

[U][B]Pictures[/B][/U]
