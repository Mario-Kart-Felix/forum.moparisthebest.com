    <description>ok so im a bit of a newbie and after watching and reading many tutorials i still encounter problem after problem. all im wanting to do is have a server set up that me and a few friends can play on privately. No actual coding needs doing just literally getting the server online. i was hoping somebody could help over skype or teamviewer maybe? Sorry for the newbieness but this is a last resort Dx.
Thanks in advance</description>

also i have no clue on how to host my server on the google compute engine vps tried finding a tut but dont seem to be any specific ones for hosting rsps on their only minecraft ones[/quote]<br>
Host a rsps would be similar to hosting a minecraft server. except you’re on port 43594, and using a different application.</p>
<p>As for port forwarding: Getting a rejection error usually means there’s a firewall… Have you tried disabling your firewall/antivirus, or your routers firewall?</p>
