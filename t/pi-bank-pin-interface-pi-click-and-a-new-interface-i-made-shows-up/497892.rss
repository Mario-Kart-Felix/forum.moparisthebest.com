Revision: 317 loading 278...
Comments: I added Bank Pin works really, really well but the problem is the bank pin interface looks too old and too old... I want it when i click on the Bank Booth and my &quot;bank pin interface&quot; shows up, a new one i made shows up. I know nothing about adding interfaces to something. Please Help!
