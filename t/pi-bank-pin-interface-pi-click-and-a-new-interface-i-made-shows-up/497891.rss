    <description>Well i think this both have to do with client and source sided.
Also considering the fact that client help is like always 0-1 person on it, mostly no one is on it these days.

Server:Runescape (Name)
Client Type: Project Insanity(Pi) &lt;- get it??? :) :P
Revision: 317 loading 278...
Comments: I added Bank Pin works really, really well but the problem is the bank pin interface looks too old and too old... I want it when i click on the Bank Booth and my &quot;bank pin interface&quot; shows up, a new one i made shows up. I know nothing about adding interfaces to something. Please Help!

              <p>Uhh. What?<br>
By the way, you’re client isn’t a PI client. PI is a server.</p>
<p>So first you add the interface to your client. Then you replace the interface ID that is in your ClickingButton.java (or ActionButton.java) with the one you just made.</p>
