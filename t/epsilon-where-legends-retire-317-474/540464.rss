Our plans:
To gain more players!
To add more content!
To satisfy our players!
And to have fun!

I see plenty of old school servers dying..
So I thought why not bring a (474) 2007 rsps in, with God Wars &amp; more stuff than the 2006!
We are thinking of improving this to the maximum level, we will be looking for good coders to to help out the dev team!
Why join Epsilon?
We are trying our best to make this one of the best 474 based [PIs] out there! To gain more players, to satisfy others &amp; to add more content! 
You suggest we do!
The experience rates are not to slow nor to fast! DECENT.. what I mean Is you can get some 99s after a day or couple hours of playing! You can compete against other Epsilon players, to be on top!
