    <description>I am looking to code my server, but i&#39;m not sure where to find some certain things that i&#39;d like to edit.

- Where you can change the experience on the items you click
- The Co-ordinates of where you spawn when logging on for the first time + when you click home
- The places where my npc shop keepers are standing
- I would appreciate some sort of starter script, and where would i put that?</description>

<p>what dyu mean by that??<br>
If your talking about changing exp given with a certain skill, go to client.java and search:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">AddSkillXP(</span><br>
And change it[/quote]<br>
It has to be in the right items case though.</p>

exp is in client.java search for the exp it gives you<br>
where you spawn is player.java<br>
Npcs are in Autospawn.java<br>
And find any command that gives you items copy and spaste it and change (“command nmae here”) to (“starter”) and use the additem or w/e guidelines to add items if you need to more items copy and paste the add item and change the id of then items and the amnt.</li>
