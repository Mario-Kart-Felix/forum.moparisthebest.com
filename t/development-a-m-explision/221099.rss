Ok most ppl know that i was the coder and owner of coowhipscape... well since i retired over 3 months ago from coding i was getting bored during the summer with no school... but since i go to work at 6am to 3pm i usually had to much time so me and my hoster thought about making a new server.. this one is a dodian pk server with the most ultimate places... i am willing to give everyone here a sneak peak... but please do not flam or spam this topic over stupid stuff... now here are the pics..



[b][u]Pk Shop-[/u][/b]
[img]http://i33.tinypic.com/dfudk6.jpg[/img]

[b][size=10pt]Staff Shop![/size][/b]
[img]http://i35.tinypic.com/1t7rc8.jpg[/img]

and for the final picture!!!!
[b][u][size=12pt]PK ZONE![/size][/u][/b]
[img]http://i37.tinypic.com/66iwp0.jpg[/img]
before the fire line.. its 1 on 1 and after the line it is all on all.

-----------------------
Ok well since i have not finished it yet and it is mainly a pk server... most of the pics are gonna be of the pk stuff... and the server grand opening 24/7 hosting will be between sunday-next sunday we havnt scheduled the date but when i get the date picked out i will have it up on here... we are hoping to have it with as many players as we use to... which is around 15-40 i has it set so it can hold a maximum of 250 players before lag and crashing starts.
If you would like to get a custom saved char file started just pm or send me the char file u would like to have on it. i am creating a custom client after the server... it will not be silabs.. since silabs is gay and is no point in it besides to let every1 have the items.. so if i add items it will be just weapons and capes nothin else...
Plz post good replys no spam or flaming plz.</description>

<p>The intelligence level of this forum continues to slide, every day. _Vengeance is one of the people at this forum that does not post a 3 lined if-statement and admire his work.</p>

<p>Wait, you’re insulting yourself to insult _Vengeance? Don’t you think that is a little stupid? All you have done is degrade yourself, having to bring a part of a male’s body into it. Really, I can do that too, “haha your dick is smaller than mine LOLOLOL GTFO HAHA SMALL DICK LOLOL NERD”. Just typing that pityful sentence I feel dirty, as the insult follows no actual validation, other than it being based on assumptions.</p>
<p>‘Fake Java’, care to elaborate on this? You all act like ‘Private servers are not Java’. I could of sworn it is built by the JDK, and uses Java’s lang. Truly, it is really only bad Java. It follows no good Java programming practices, most of important being Object Orientated Programming.</p>
<p>EDIT: Sorry about the bump, I was talking on IRC and someone posted this link. I made a mistake by not checking the date of the post - sorry.</p>

<p>Want some examples? I’m happy to give some.<br>
And learn to “program” Java before attempting to “program” a server.</p>

<p>9999 Sure that I have more respect from respected people around here. And if 80% of Moparscape was smarter then me I would quite honestly become an hero.<br>
Also - I don’t need 2 sets of male appendage.<br>
And if I’m the worlds biggest dumb fuck, why are you the one being proved wrong?</p>
