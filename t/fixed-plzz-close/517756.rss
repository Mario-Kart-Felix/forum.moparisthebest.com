<p>hey guys my servers pretty much up, i have already portforwarded my router to 43594 (yes my client and source ports are set to that aswell) and <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> can see the connection so theres nothing my firewalls doing to it, i even tried to turn off my firewall and it still worked so i dont think it matters if its on or off, however now i need to change the client ip so it can connect to my launcher when i jar it, im using rune evo source with matrix 718 client and ive tried to set the ip in my loader to my .no-ip.biz address and i compiled it and ran it but it wouldnt connect to my source becuz it just sat at 0. so i tried it with my ip (my normal ip) and it still didnt work, ive been trying to get this to work for hours now and it just wont work, Can someone please help me?  thanks</p>
