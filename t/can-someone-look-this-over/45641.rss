    <title>Can someone look this over?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-look-this-over/45641</link>
    <description>I think I made some errors, mainly because I did this in study hall mostly in my head...

[quote=&quot;areithe.org&quot;]Did you know under perfect ideal conditions E. Coli can divide every 20 minutes? that means after one day they can divide enough to cover 235675489.32516712702622929094775 earth circumference&#39;s. I&#39;m not sure if my math is correct tho so I&#39;ll show you the work.

24*60=1440 minutes in a day. 1440/20=72 therefore there are 72 twenty minutes in 24 hours.

x=# of e coli
(x+x)^72 = y
y=# of e coli in 24 hours
y=4.722366483 * 10^21
y=4,722,366,483,000,000,000,000

Now you can fit (maximum size of e coli) 500 e coli in one mm.

so you divide 4,722,366,483,000,000,000,000 by 500 which equals 9444732966000000000.

Divide 9444732966000000000 by 10 to get cm, which is 944473296600000000.

Divide 944473296600000000 by 100 to get meters, which is 9444732966000000.

Multiply 9444732966000000 by 0.000621371192 because 1 meter = 0.000621371192 mile, which is 5868684981205.115472.

Divide 5868684981205.115472 by 24,901.55 because The circumference of the earth at the equator is 24,901.55 miles which is 235675489.32516712702622929094775.

Therefore they can cover 235675489.32516712702622929094775 total earth circumferences.

Now keep in mind some of this work was done mentally and I have had very little sleep lately so I&#39;m 75% sure I&#39;m wrong lol. I know the work is all right but I&#39;m not sure if my intial algebraic equation is right. Anyone thats sees an error post a correction, thank you.

316940069.8701952 mi² is the total surface area of the earth, can anybody figure out if they would cover the whole surface?[/quote]</description>

<p>20 * log[sub]2[/sub] (Circumference of the Earth / .002mm)[/quote]</p>
<p>Assuming the circumference is 40,000 km (its actually about 40,075 or something at the equator, but I can’t be bothered looking it up) then 20 * log[sub]2[/sub] (Circumference of the Earth / .002mm)  = 485.07</p>
<p>485.07 * 40000 km = 19,402,797 km = 9.701 x 10[sup]15[/sup] e coli bacteria, which is far less than 4.722 x 10[sup]21[/sup] obtained from 2^72</p>
<p>Unless that was meant to be something else…</p>

              <p>Dunno where you get 10^72 tbh.</p>
<p>Unless I misunderstand, you start with 1 e coli bacteria.  In 24 hours there would be either 72 or 73 replications…depends if you start time 0 with a replication (I’ll assume 72).  This also assumes that replication takes a mere instant, whereas in reality it takes a bit longer (dunno about bacteria, but a typical human skin cell takes about 3 hours or so to replicate I believe).</p>
<p>So the number of e coli after 1 day of replications from 1 bacteria in ideal conditions without any deaths would be 1 * 2^72 = 4722366482869645213696</p>
<p>Assuming 500 fit into a single millimeter, lined up, the e coli would stretch 9.445 trillion kilometers.  Assuming the earth has a circumference of 40,000 km, it would stretch 236,071,109 times the circumference of the earth.</p>
<p>So our answers are pretty close <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
