    <title>I need help with setting up a lan server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-setting-up-a-lan-server/297819</link>
    <description>Obviously im stupid... I just can&#39;t seem to do it. I&#39;ve even searched, no luck with that.

My questions are:

Whats IP&#39;s have to be set and what IP do I need? My routers IP or my computers IP?

Do I need port fowarding?

And thats it.


It&#39;s for me and siblings to mess around with. Cannot get it working at all... im sort of unexperienced in this area. Help would be greatly appriciated. If you could, maybe take it step by step?

My siblings cannot connect to my server.</description>
