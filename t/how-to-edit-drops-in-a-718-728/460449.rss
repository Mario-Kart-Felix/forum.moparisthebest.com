    <title>How to edit drops in a 718/728</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-edit-drops-in-a-718-728/460449</link>
    <description>I am working on a 718/728 server for a few weeks,and updated/fixed alot,the only thing i have to do till i finished it,is changing the drops of the npc&#39;s.
But i have no idea how to do that on a 718,
It has a file called dropeditor in the source,but I dont know how to use it,i also dont know if it works.
If someone could help me,i would be very thankfull :)
The source is Zenith.</description>
