    <description>Ok I know alot of you know how to do this already so dont flame im mainly posting this for a few friends that are just starting to make there Server or leeching off of other servers ok i will get on to the guide now

&lt;blockquote&gt;First off in your server files you will see something that says ( Client.java ) open that up&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then push (ctrl ) and hold ( F ) down a little bar will pop up type in ( welcome ) or what ever the words say when you login your server...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
