<p>sorry to disappoint, but my arch install took about 30 minutes to wget all the updated packages, format the system and configure it and it takes &lt; 5s to boot from bios splash with my ssd. both times are &lt; than windows for install and boot.</p>

<p>[quote author=runescape3dude link=topic=540406.msg4008234#msg4008234 date=1338885559]When all the components are cold, the resistance is lower and therefore more current will flow for the part of a second when you first turn the system on, this can damage the system. This is also the same reason why light bulbs rarely fail when in use. They usually fail within a second of you turning them on.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>oh hey runescape3dude is talking out his ass again everyone!</p>
<p>you’re comparing a computer with a psu that should be connected to a surge protector to a cheap mass produced lightbulb which run directly off of the mains, flawless logic, and not to mention lightbulbs are notorious for wasting a LOT of electricity on heat to the point where touching a lightbulb can cause burns, but touching an idle modern cpu without a heatsink will just hurt a lot</p>

<p>Also, at school, computers only generally last 1.5-2 years before the hard disks and other components begin to fail as the computers are turned on and off at least 6 times a day. In these situations, I believe it would be better to just leave them running non stop.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>or maybe it has something to do with schools using the cheapest mass produced harddrives they can get?</p>
<p>data centres have harddrives fail too you know, and it’s very rare for data centres to turn their drives off</p>

<p>Windows boots faster on my pc than linux ever has, I can get from bios -&gt; desktop in less than 15 seconds, and that’s a usable desktop not waiting for bullshit apps to load up.</p>

</aside>
<p>then perhaps you haven’t taken the time to configure linux properly, arch could boot in &lt;10 seconds 5+ years ago when configured properly, and fedora boasted that it could boot in 10 seconds stock a few years ago, much like how windows 7 boots in 10 seconds on ssds[/quote]</p>
<p>It is well known physics that electrical resistance decreases when temperature decreases. This can be dangerous for components… PSUs are not perfect, the tolerances in the components are probably at best ± 5% in 99% of PSUs. The best thing to do is not even have a computer, there will be no risk of anything fucking out then.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@hibernating</span> windows seven: Whenever I ever hibernate my (windows 7) desktop PC, it doesn’t want to boot up properly again, ie it takes between 5-10 minutes to start up again and may not even start again without deleting restoration data.</p>

<p>oh hey runescape3dude is talking out his ass again everyone!</p>
<p>you’re comparing a computer with a psu that should be connected to a surge protector to a cheap mass produced lightbulb which run directly off of the mains, flawless logic, and not to mention lightbulbs are notorious for wasting a LOT of electricity on heat to the point where touching a lightbulb can cause burns, but touching an idle modern cpu without a heatsink will just hurt a lot</p>

<p>or maybe it has something to do with schools using the cheapest mass produced harddrives they can get?</p>
<p>data centres have harddrives fail too you know, and it’s very rare for data centres to turn their drives off</p>

<p>then perhaps you haven’t taken the time to configure linux properly, arch could boot in &lt;10 seconds 5+ years ago when configured properly, and fedora boasted that it could boot in 10 seconds stock a few years ago, much like how windows 7 boots in 10 seconds on ssds</p>

<p>Pretty much what I do, it gives you the best of both worlds. Also I’ve gone through control panel to set my computers ‘power off’ button to set my computer to sleep. I’m talking about the physical button located on the case.</p>

Just leave it on. Why waste the time shutting it down and then starting it back up, when you can just un lock your screen faster…<br>

This, I just don’t find it very smart to leave your computer on 24/7, whats the point? The average boot up speed for Win7 is 40 seconds, and its usually faster for me, so why leave it on when it only takes a minute to load up your computer?</p>
