    <description>THIS IS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PORT FORWARDING, I BELIEVE IT IS A FIREWALL.
I AM NOT NEW TO HOSTING+SCRIPTING BUT THIS HASN&#39;T HAPPENED BEFORE.

This has been a problem since I brought a router for the computer but, when I run the server only I can connect using ip: 0.0.0.0, the no-ip addresses I created don&#39;t let poeple connect. My computer can connect to it but no-one else can. Also note that, I can&#39;t connect with my computer using the no-ip. 

I have done everything, since it worked before the router, I even port-forwarded the new router, so there should be no problems there.
I have created a no-ip address but no one can connect to it still.

Can anyone possibly tell me what could be wrong, so I can fix it?

Thanks
