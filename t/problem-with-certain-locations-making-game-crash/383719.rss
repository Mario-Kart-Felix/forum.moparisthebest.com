    <title>Problem with certain locations making game crash</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-certain-locations-making-game-crash/383719</link>
    <description>I have a small problem: on the downloadable MoparScape client, when I go far enough into the elf lands, or to the far east of Falador, the game disconnects me, freezes, and I have to restart the client. Does anyone know how to fix this problem?
If it helps, I&#39;m using a Mac, but my friend who uses Windows Vista also has this problem.

I apologize if this has already been answered.</description>

              <p>Thanks for the info. The strange thing is, my other friend told me the elf lands work for him, and he has the same client.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for the help.</p>

              <p>the reason why this happens is because those parts of the map might not be added to either the client or server. try getting a player-made client.  but thats all i’d really know</p>
