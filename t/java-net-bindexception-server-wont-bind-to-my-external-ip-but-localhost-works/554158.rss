    <title>(java.net.BindException) Server wont bind to my external ip, but localhost works</title>

    <description>Hey guys,

So I wanted to run my server publicly for testing and strangely it will run on localhost but it will not run when I input my no-ip or my actual external ip. It gives me a &quot;java.net.BindException&quot; Funny enough, this does not happen at my friend&#39;s house on his PC, but it does happen on mine. I have a feeling it&#39;s my router settings or something. Could someone please tell me what would cause this binding error?

I just misread, my mistake.</p>
<p>You can use uTorrent to open ports with <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"><br>
People might not prefer it, however it could work lol[/quote]<br>
People have a problem using uTorrent - explained later.</p>
<p>First off, if you want to use it, you need to make sure “uPnP” is enabled on your router (Last I saw, your router has an option to enable it <a class="mention" href="/u/demogorgon">@Demogorgon</a>).<br>
Second, you want to have the program installed.</p>
<p>Now, this is how I <span class="bbcode-b">used to</span> get uTorrent to work with my RSPS, I don’t think much has changed…<br>
1: Open uTorrent, go into Options &gt; Preferences &gt; Connection<br>
2: Make sure “Randomize port each start” is unticked, and “Enable uPnP port mapping” is enabled, along with "Add Windows Firewall Exception"<br>
3: Run the RSPS.<br>
4: go back into the preferences, and set the port to 43594.<br>
5: Restart your RSPS.</p>
<p>If you get an error saying the port is in use, you need to change uTorrent off 43594, and repeat steps 3-5.</p>
<p>Again: This is what I did like 2-3 ish years ago to handle it, if shit has changed, I’m sorry.</p>
<p>The problem people used to have, was due to either not having uPnP support on their router, or due to them attempting to run the rsps while uTorrent was on the port (See steps 3-5).</p>

Call them and explain your problem. (Minus anything with “RSPS” or rsps related. Just say “A java application”)<br>
Say you are having a problem opening a specific port on the router.<br>
Ask if there’s firewalls, etc that could be preventing the port from opening.<br>
Ask if there is a way they could do it, or if it’s even possible.[/quote]</p>
<p>Actually I think you’re right. I used a port checking tool and none of the ports I have opened are open. I will call tomorrow and give you guys an update.</p>

<p>Yes, I can run the server normally on localhost and connect to it fine. I can even use my external ip in the client to connect to the server and its fine. My main issue is that I can host the server publicly on my friend’s computer, because it allows me to set his external ip as the server ip. I port forward at his place, and I can connect from my house. If I try hosting at my house, I cant set my external ip as the server IP, not on my laptop OR my desktop. Therefore it’s a router issue and I guess I’ll have to suck it up and host at my friend’s place unless someone knows what the hell a router could do to cause this.</p>

Your router also has nothing to do with it. You don’t even need to be connected to the internet to run your server locally (ie. on your computer offline).</p>
<p>First figure out why you can’t run locally. I’d check for any apps you might have running that could be interferring. Check your firewall too, try turning it off.[/quote]<br>
Strange. The topic title says he can run it on localhost.<br>
The OP also said that it works fine, running locally.<br>

Your router also has nothing to do with it. You don’t even need to be connected to the internet to run your server locally (ie. on your computer offline).</p>
<p>First figure out why you can’t run locally. I’d check for any apps you might have running that could be interferring. Check your firewall too, try turning it off.</p>

This person says that they’ve apparently disabled port forwarding on the router/modem you use.<br>
If that’s true, then you won’t be able to portforward from your house until you get a different router.<br>

There’s no reason he needs to specify an IP address for the server. It’s a waste of time and effort on his end.<br>

What’s this about specifying IP’s, you can’t bind your server to a specified. How about I bind my server to your IP? It does not work like that. Hence the client/server model.[/quote]</p>
<blockquote>InetSocketAddress(String hostname, int port)
Creates a socket address from a hostname and a port number.</blockquote>
^What he is using.
Vs:
<blockquote>InetSocketAddress(int port)
Creates a socket address where the IP address is the wildcard address and the port number a specified value.</blockquote>
The specific error he is getting:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/QucgmLc.png[/img]
Would appear to be it's because he cannot bind to the host specified.
So, I suggested to remove the host specified, and use the wildcard.

What’s this about specifying IP’s, you can’t bind your server to a specified. How about I bind my server to your IP? It does not work like that. Hence the client/server model.</p>

You could simply remove the “host” argument from the InetSocketAddress… Then it’d use your IP as a wildcard, instead of making you specify it.<br>

<p>It sounds like you’d be right. I bound the server to localhost (might I add, my friend’s computer lets me bind to the external ip, where as my computer does not and gives me the error I posted). I set the ip in my client to my external ip. I can connect to it fine using the external ip on the computer that’s hosting the server on localhost, but when I try to connect from another computer in the house it will not connect. I am port forwarded, hopefully correctly. This router is weird because it makes me assign an ip address to the open port and it asks me for a port range for internal and external port. I used my external ip, and port 43594-43595 for both internal and external. ??? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>

You cant connect using another computer in the house, because X-J-K-X forgot to explain that part for you.</p>
<p>There are actually <span class="bbcode-b">3</span> different IP addresses you can use, depending on where you are connecting to the server from.</p>
<ol>
<li>Locally. If you are on the same computer as the server, you connect to localhost (0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1, “localhost”, etc)</li>
<li>Same network. When you are connected to the same network, you don’t need to route outside of it. Use the same IP address that you used to port forward (Usually 192.168.0.X, 10.0.0.X, etc, this will vary based on your router).</li>
<li>Different network. This is when you use the IP found <a href="http://ip4.me" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m still honestly confused on why your server is making you specify what you bind it to. It should do it automatically…[/quote]</p>
<p>Alright, that makes a little more sense. I’ll have to do some tests then and see if other people can connect. My server.java file has a server = “0.0.0.0” line where I specify what ip to bind it to. Im consufed because on my friend’s computer I dont get the error and I can successfully bind to his external ip. On my computer, that does not work and I’m stuck with binding to localhost?</p>
