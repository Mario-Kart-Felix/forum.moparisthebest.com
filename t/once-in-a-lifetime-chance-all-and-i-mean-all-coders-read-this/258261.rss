    <description>(Soz if in wrong place)

To all the coders out there,new,pro&#39;s and the vets i need you assistance in this BIG project. would you ever want to wake up one day and think hey im going to code a server 2day, and then remember ohh crap i remember that post on Moparscape about help with a server project. what was it called oh yes RunePkz, so then you think to youself hey lets see how it went i bet its not even up anymore, then you log onto the website and your bottom jaw drops to the ground and you are almost dead with shock, your pants are wet and you smell like poo? and think awww i should of helped with that server and i would have been a staff, well i might aswel go and kill myself, WELL this is one of those times, the goal for this project is for me and some other pro coder to assis in the making of one if not the best RuneScape Private server ever, it will have full,skills,working cc,clan wars,god wars,jad,dueling ect. it will not be a only pk server like most or a onl skiller server like most but a mix of the two where the pkers ans skillers come together to make a econemy and comunity like no other. the skillers help the pkers and the pkers help then skillers. this server WILL be 24/7 and once it is made will hopefuly be up for years to come with weekly updates, small and big. specs about the server, some skills will be easy to train like this server but easyer, someskills will be harder to train than this server and rs e.g prayer. the home is based in lumbi, with edge,mb and varrok pking, also full dueling, some quests, npc&#39;s with drops to get good items full slayer, all skills and clan based things eg cc,clan wars,castle wars ,server wide wars for special occations and winning clan may recisve specail items, there will be some pj/teaming area and some 1v1 areas also there will be full ancients and other stuff. you probably going to get board of reading this so im gunna stop there but there is SOOOOOOOO many MORE things on this server, so if your a coder no matter how good, al long as you CAN CODE then post here and be a part of this once in a life time oppertuney.

(P.S soz about spelling and everyone that helps will get staff spot. also you MUST add jako-wolste@hotmail.co.uk my msn and if you dont have msn and want to be a part of this project then get it ffs you MUST have msn not hard to download its how we gunna be in contact. )</description>
