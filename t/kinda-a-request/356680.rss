    <title>Kinda a request</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/kinda-a-request/356680</link>
    <description>hi i wish to make a packaged framework for 317 but i do not have a framework making knowledge in programming.

so i ask for someone that could help me make a framework and point things out on what to do and how i would connect ports and stuff...

i have a basic package source with nothing in the java files...

and i set it out how i would like it to be done...

the helper will receive 99.9% credits if they make most of the parts to it.

I&#39;m kinda thinking of a name called Project Eclipse...

my packaged source with nothing in them:

http://uppit.com/rg3ue852ifjj/PE.rar

it would be much appreciated...

and also helper will be the one to release and get all rep if does get released...</description>
