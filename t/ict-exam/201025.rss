    <title>ICT exam</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ict-exam/201025</link>
    <description>Okay so our school was supposed to take our ICT GCSE exam on wednesday (15th) but we had to be postponed because our retarded school hasn&#39;t set up the computers. 

So that means that people have already taken the exam I&#39;m going to take on monday, so is there some website where they post the question and stuff? So I can see what I&#39;ve gotta know and then revise it.

Thanks for anything useful.</description>

Nah I’m not in to cheating in my other exams. Just that I don’t care at all about ICT so I don’t mind if I cheat myself.</p>
<p>To be honest the best method of cheating in an exam that I’ve heard is having a few rubber bands around your wrist. Stretch them out and write tips on it (for example in physics you could write an equation that you will need… e.g. e=mc^2). Then let go of it and it will shrink down and it won’t be noticable. Then in the exam simple fiddle with it, and stretch it out between your legs and read it, that way you’ve pretty much done it.</p>
<p>Only problem is if a teacher finds out. If you are caught cheating in any GCSE exam then you can have every single one of your papers torn up.</p>
