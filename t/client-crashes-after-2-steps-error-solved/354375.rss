I figured it out... If you run your client through terminal (which I do) you type in something like &quot;Java -Xmx500m EGUI&quot;.  this runs it in 64bit mode automatically, which shouldn&#39;t matter... but when you run the client and type &quot;Java -d32 -Xmx500m&quot; (notice that I added a -d32) &lt;-this fixes the running in 64 bit mode problem (for some computers).
Hope this helps...

Hey guys, I&#39;ve had a fairly big problem with all 317 clients on my computer (other clients work fine)

here is the log of one of the clients
[code]Loading the DeltaScape client..

I am running snow leopard, on a mac... But, all other clients (508 562 etc.) work, just not the 317...

Thank you
