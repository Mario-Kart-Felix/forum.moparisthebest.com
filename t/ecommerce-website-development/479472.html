        <p>ECommerce websites have their own unique character that is designed to lead the visitor to one simple task – make an online purchase. Flash Web Designers needs to consider a variety of online selling principles while designing an eCommerce website. In this article we will try to take a look at some of the major design aspects that you must have in an eCommerce website. Many of you are probably already asking why <span class="bbcode-b"><a href="http://www.developmentguruji.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"> ecommerce website development </a></span> is different from any other website development. They all need to be attractive, well organized and use the right colors that fits the website spirit and so on. Your instincts are good. However a close look at some successful eCommerce websites will reveal the conceptual differences that are typical in a successful eCommerce website.</p>
<p>An eCommerce website needs to follow certain selling principles: Give the user a pleasant experience during his online shopping, Make certain you provide sufficient information on who owns the website and why they should be trusted and The website must be easy to use. If it isn’t, the visitor will go to your competitor.</p>
<p>Those principles are not new. We all know those basics from our day to day experiences in the mall, shopping center and every other market place that is waiting for us to open up our wallets. The big challenge for a web designer is how to translate those conventional marketing techniques to the virtual world of the internet. I’m sure you’ve all noticed that in most supermarkets the bread stand is placed at the far end of the building, yet you can smell the fresh bread at the entrance (sometimes they even use a special air duct to carry the smells). That has been done deliberately. Marketers use our sense of smell to draw us through the store where we are exposed to all sorts of tempting goodies as we go to get our loaf of bread.</p>
<p>How do you draw an imaginarily path in a web page? A path designed to lead the visitor to do what you want him to do…make an online purchase. Unlike the supermarket our website has no smell. In a website the distance from one point to the other is pretty much the same, so the exit is always right there. In a website you can try to order the “shelf” in the way you think will best expose the visitor to many of your products, but there is always a chance that he will find a short cut to another page that can also be the way off your site.</p>
<p>As can be see, although putting your products on the web is much easier then renting space and opening a supermarket. However, selling your products on the web can be difficult.</p>
