    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-please-help-me-out-mpc-to-log-in/509101</link>
    <description>i got moparclassic i have everything set up. the loginserver connects to the game server and all.  i got my forums set with register and it saves the account you make to the forums database in users and it also stores it in the game database in the pk_players. 

 when i try to log into the client it tells me that i have a invalid username and password when i am using the right credentials.  
If anyone can help id appreciate it, as i have tried for some time now in between working and regular life stuff lol thanks in advance.</description>

<p>Instead of spamming everyone’s private message inbox, why don’t you try to debug the issue? See what username/password the server receives from the client, what does the login server receive from the game server? This issue isn’t hard to fix…</p>
