    <description>I&#39;m using this tutorial (http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,243724.0.html) to make a client. Well when i have the client picture on paint, i have it X by X numbers right. But I don&#39;t know where the middle is to put a line which i have to flip/rotate on 1 side of the line. Well i put the picture name into class sub 2 sub 1 sub 1. I compile, no errors. But when i run it, i get this message on my runserver.bat box, which says...error:  loaderror starting up 20. Well on the client, it says.. To fix this try the following (in order): then it lists things, i have them all right. what is wrong with it? please help. and i apologize for this being so long.</description>
