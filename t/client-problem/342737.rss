    <title>Client Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-problem/342737</link>
    <description>I have my server running with portforwarding done and everything. I added my server ip to codefasga.com/status already so i know my server works. I have a problem though. None of the clients work for me. I might get onto the game for like 5 seconds but then the client will just close. Also when im on the client the mouse gets really laggy and it looks like when you drag it its going pixel by pixel in a laggy way. I have the newest jre and jdk installed. Also im running on vista. Can anyone help me or tell me whats wrong?</description>
