    <description>Well I have a server that a lot of people like... But i have one problem... When i get about 12 people on my server I get this Java Heap Space Message or something in the Compiler... And then no more people can join... So i restart the server only to get the people who werent able to get on before complaining about not being able to get on and stuff... How can i be able to get more people on my server instead of it only being 12? I also heard of something called like worlds or something? Can someone explain that to me aswell?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 26, 2008, 01:58:14 pm[/size][hr]I am guessing no one knows the answer to my question?
