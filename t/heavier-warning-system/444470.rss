    <title>Heavier Warning System</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/heavier-warning-system/444470</link>
    <description>Well, I think we need a heavier policy / enforcement of the rules. Although I have to give credits to the mods and admins for doing such a great job, it&#39;s more the players fault.

People post advertising threads in almost all of the sections here, and members of the community just keep bumping the shit out of the post. All that should be done is the first user [s]to post saying advertising isn&#39;t allowed + report.[/s] to see the post should just hit the report button, instead of 10 people bumping the topic, making it the most active topic.

If anyone posts, it can be counted as spam, since the rules are there in every section, and even warned or something.</description>

              <p>Report whatever you personally feel is spam. The moderator handling the reports at that point may or may not agree with you. I’ve handled many reports without doing any actions because I feel none are needed.</p>
<p>As far advertising goes (which seems to be your prime example), this will probably be significantly reduced if the advertisements section comes back.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I feel that the boards should have quite a bit of cleaning up. I’ll worry about this personally quite soon.</p>
<p>Marking as resolved. Thanks for the concern. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

If you feel this has resolved your suggestion, please post so we can move it to the resolved board.[/quote]Yes, this has been resolved, thanks.</p>
<p>Also, should we report people who do bump/spam these posts? Or just if it’s a ridiculous spam/bump? I know there probably is already enough to keep the moderators busy.</p>

              <p>I mean, one person posting that it’s against the rules is fine, but you see advertisement threads with like 10 useless posts, and they just loom at the top of the downloads section etc. If only one person posted.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about moderating / warning the people that are advertising, I’m talking about the people that keep posting un-needed posts instead of just leaving it to be locked.</p>

              <p>We already moderate/mute people for advertising depending on the moderator and the extent of the advertisements. Are you now suggesting that we warn people who are posting on the topic saying that he’s breaking the rules? I don’t agree with that idea if that’s what you’re saying. The people posting may be an inconvenience sometimes, but generally they don’t do harm.</p>
<p>If you’re talking about somebody else bumping that topic in support of the advertisement however, then I would agree with you. Although the moderators do tend to warn the members who do this also at the moment. It really depends on the moderators discretion at the time.</p>
