    <title>[530] Runescape 2 C# Server, Based on XenoRune</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/530-runescape-2-c-server-based-on-xenorune/402824</link>
    <description>
[ul]This is the release of the Runescape 2 C# server framework.
It&#39;s been ported from Xenorune java server with a few fixes.

This is pretty much a nearly empty base of a 530 server. It does support what Xenorune supported.. mostly all credit goes to [b]Luke132[/b] for developing this base in java in the first place or else I might of based this on some other base.

Download Links:
I put it on Google Code
https://code.google.com/p/runescape-server-csharp

Here are the direct links to the client and server. In both ZIP and RAR formats.
Server:
http://runescape-server-csharp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/server.zip
http://runescape-server-csharp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/server.rar
Client:
http://runescape-server-csharp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/client.zip
http://runescape-server-csharp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/client.rar


Here is where the files are to client and server
https://code.google.com/p/runescape-server-csharp/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FRunescape%20530%20Server%253Fstate%253Dclosed

The cache530 has to be moved to C:\ drive for client to work properly.


To download the Server and Client download SVN Client I recommand TortoiseSVN
and right click anywhere in your desktop and click SVN Checkout.
For URL of repository type
http://runescape-server-csharp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

it should download all the files to your desktop from google code.

The layout of this server is so simple anybody can really edit it add new things etc.
Grand Exchange system now loads from SQLite database.

You can easily convert the loading/saving characters to SQLite as well..

[b]~530 Cache (Extract this under &quot;C:\ drive&quot; should look like &quot;C:\cache530&quot;) 60.68 MB[/b]

You may be required to install Microsoft&#39;s .Net Framework 4.0 link below.
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851

[b]To Compile Read below you need Visual C# 2010 Express Edition[/b]
To compile and even edit the server don&#39;t do it in notepad.

download Visual C# 2010 Express Edition from Microsoft.
Here is the link http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9709939
It will install like 150 MB IDE.

To test your project you&#39;ll see a little green arrow click that to run your server it will only run if there are not any errors in code,

To make a exe (compile) there is 3 ways to do this, Most simplest is pressing F6. You can also right click your project name where it shows the project files that show on the right top side and click Build.

Most common way to compile is by clicking the Build in the top of the window and on the menu that pops out click Build Solution.

Don&#39;t forgot to click the blue floppy disk to save the project every few changes, it may involve clicking the multiple blue floppy disk icon to save multiple files you edit.

To make new class files adding new content for example right click the Project files main project name on the right top side and click Add then New Item, select Class and make a name for it.

They got a newer version Visual C# 2013 edition now it may work not sure but its very bulky and i think its slower too on older pcs not to mention they only let you run those for 90 days then you have to pay money.

Fixes include
~No more wrong flashing skills they flash properly and show the icon when you level up.
~Fixed duel arena bug where one player could go to confirmation screen and accept for both players.
~Added player loading/saving in XML format.
~Added loading/saving to Grand exchange, in SQLite
~Added a bunch of definitions for items,objects,npcs.
~Added my own custom PlayerUpdating system and wanted to add my own moving system as well then I realized the one this uses is actually faster.
~Most of the porting went well except for Events had to rewrite that with a similar C# equivalent which turned out to work perfect.
~Problems occurred with byte / short in some places as java is only signed language and C# is both signed and unsigned but I managed to fix all these (most of the problems were in chat encryption/decryption and clicking objects).
 ~Added a Player and Npc Following system (pretty crappy, doesn&#39;t support actual direction change doesn&#39;t look natural)
~Fixed the damage updateMask now it supports sending damage over 99.. you can send up to 32000+ damage.
~New packet which was supposedly called followPlayer in Xenorune but it turned out to be a still graphics packet.

Few features I found were 
~Working Special Attacks
~Working Barrows
~20% working Brimhaven agility course (only first 2 obstacles work).
~Working dueling so yeah working combat.
~Working npc movement and drops.
~Working bank (although the dialogue needs work)
~Stairs and ladders do all work but you will have to add them in yourself 1 by 1, by editing the laddersAndStairs.xml file there is also a command to reload your edited laddersAndStairs file by typing ::reloadladderxml
As for skills.
~Agility (most courses work Barbarian,Gnome,Wilderness)
~Cooking (untested, but seems to only work on fires, not ranges)
~Crafting
~Farming
~Firemaking (I added the new packet useItemWithGroundItem and fixed this)
~Fishing
~Herblore
~Magic (Haven&#39;t tested this, but teleports work without runes for now)
~Mining
~Prayer
~Runecrafting
~Slayer
~Smithing
~Thieving
~Woodcuting

<p>Okay it’s released the same links as before, a small bug remains where if you kill a NPC he will spawn for 1 second then disappear again (no idea why this happens).</p>
<p>Another bug in Grand Exchange if you keep Buy/Sell Offer opened when you a sale is getting processed the orange bar will increase and will turn green when complete but you won’t see the item in slots 1 and gold in slot 2 appear… only until you leave the Grand Exchange and reopen it will you see the items.</p>

              <p>To compile and even edit the server don’t do it in notepad.</p>
<p>download Visual C# 2010 Express Edition from Microsoft.<br>
Here is the link <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9709939" rel="nofollow noopener">http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9709939</a><br>
It will install like 150 MB IDE.</p>
<p>To test your project you’ll see a little green arrow click that to run your server it will only run if there are not any errors in code,</p>
<p>To make a exe (compile) there is 3 ways to do this, Most simplest is pressing F6. You can also right click your project name where it shows the project files that show on the right top side and click Build.</p>
<p>Most common way to compile is by clicking the Build in the top of the window and on the menu that pops out click Build Solution.</p>
<p>Don’t forgot to click the blue floppy disk to save the project every few changes, it may involve clicking the multiple blue floppy disk icon to save multiple files you edit.</p>
<p>To make new class files adding new content for example right click the Project files main project name on the right top side and click Add then New Item, select Class and make a name for it.</p>
<p>They got a newer version Visual C# 2013 edition now it may work not sure but its very bulky and i think its slower too on older pcs not to mention they only let you run those for 90 days then you have to pay money.</p>
