    <description>I know it was stupid but I deleted everything to do with clients and servers off my computer so I could try and download 317, I also deleted the jdk while doing that and now every time I try to download it, it says &quot;You have already downloaded this do you wish to overwrite it&quot; then I say yes and it starts again, gets to the end and it deletes all it&#39;s downloaded so far and says the overwrite message again and it keeps looping.</description>

              <p>I did that and it still says that it already exists and there is nothing in the Java folder that says jdk so I’m really confused and annoyed???</p>
<p>I also searched the whole computer for “jdk” and deleted all files that were there and it still wont download.</p>
