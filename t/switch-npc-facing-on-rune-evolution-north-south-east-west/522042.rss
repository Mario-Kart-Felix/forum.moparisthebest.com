in utils.java you can put the line anywhere you please, preferably the middle. in world.java the same goes, you can bassicaly put it anywhere aswell. now you can use the enum  import “import com.rs.utils.Utils.FaceDirection;” into utils.java and into npcspawning.java, just make sure you remove your previous “import com.rs.utils.Utils.EntityDirection;” from npcspawning.java. try that an see if it works</p>

              <p>i dont use the enum method, it seems better but it  realy isnt much different. do you happen to have the error report from the previous try (not the enumeration method but the entity one)   but you have to delete the previous files you put in, before you replace them with the enum. try the firstway and post your errors, ill be able to help you better</p>

              <p>make sure you didnt import that twice,  this is the same system i have been using for my npc’s direction an i am using rune-evo aswell, that should work 100% an if not 100% then 150%. just take another look at it an see if you missplaced something. also if your more experienced there is the enumeration you can use: in utils.java [code]public enum FaceDirection {</p>
<pre><code>NORTH,

SOUTH,

EAST,

WEST;
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]  and in world.java <code>	if (direction.equals(FaceDirection.NORTH)) {
		directionalTile.setLocation(tile.getX(), tile.getY() + 1, tile.getPlane());
	| else if (direction.equals(FaceDirection.SOUTH)) {
		directionalTile.setLocation(tile.getX(), tile.getY() - 1, tile.getPlane());
	} else if (direction.equals(FaceDirection.EAST)) {
		directionalTile.setLocation(tile.getX() + 1, tile.getY(), tile.getPlane());
	} else if (direction.equals(FaceDirection.WEST)) {
		directionalTile.setLocation(tile.getX() - 1, tile.getY(), tile.getPlane());
	} else
		throw new IllegalStateException("No such face direction!");</code> however with this you have to implement the directions that are like  SOUTH_EAST and  NORTH_EAST<br>
I do have teamveiwer but it shouldnt be required, if you try it and you still cant get it to work then iguess i could use teamviewer. just recheck everything and be sure</p>

              <p>did you import it correctly? i did leave a majority of it out, but i guess youd probably need em…<br>
so in utils.java add this [code]public enum EntityDirection {<br>
NORTH(8192),<br>
SOUTH(0),<br>
EAST(12288),<br>
WEST(4096),<br>
NORTHEAST(10240),<br>
SOUTHEAST(14366),<br>
NORTHWEST(6144),<br>

    public int getValue() {
    	return value;
    }
    
    private EntityDirection(int value) {
    	this.value = value;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]  then in world.java  add <code>public static final NPC spawnNPC(int id, WorldTile tile,
			int mapAreaNameHash, boolean canBeAttackFromOutOfArea, EntityDirection faceDirection) {
	NPC returnValue = spawnNPC(id, tile, mapAreaNameHash, canBeAttackFromOutOfArea, false);
	returnValue.setDirection(faceDirection.getValue());
	return returnValue;
}</code> and then you import this in npcspawning.java <code>import com.rs.utils.Utils.EntityDirection;</code></p>
<p>And after that you can add the spawn line’s like so <code>world.spawnNPC(530, new WorldTile(2957, 3390, 0), -1, false, EntityDirection.NORTHEAST);</code>  This should help 100% <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I am using rune-evo aswell, the best way to do this (since rune-evo dosnt support it by default) is to import the derection entity in your npcspawning.java, like so <code>import com.rs.utils.Utils.EntityDirection;</code> and edit your npcspawning lines so there like this <code>World.spawnNPC(2253, new WorldTile(2104, 3918, 0), -1, false, EntityDirection.WEST);</code>   make sure you include “EntityDirection.^^^”  (change those ^ to your direction, like WEST, EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, NORTHWEST etc.  also make sure your directions are typed in caps otherwise it wont work.  hope this helps <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
