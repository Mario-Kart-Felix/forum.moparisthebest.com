    <title>Serverstat page posting Error (more info inside)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/serverstat-page-posting-error-more-info-inside/219977</link>
    <description>Well every time i post my server it says:

Sorry, you can only post one server at a time.
--------------------------------------------

Wich is a bug of the serverstatpage (please fix it!)
because:

It worked before, server is off for like 2 months, so its way belong 40% now.
Its not the name (i tested with lhdflhafh)
Its not wrong ip, because if i test it with runelocus the server is ONLINE.

So my conclusion is, its a website error.
-----------------------------------------
Somthing i want to know, is there another site where i can post my server, wich is pretty much used?

Thanks all for helping!


ohh and btw, if someone knows how to fix, or gives a good site, i glady give you admin on my server!
