    <title>Saving help. characters being reseted</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/saving-help-characters-being-reseted/166125</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using JordieScape source.
i ran the server just fine.
The server crashes every 40 mins or so.
But when it crashes theres atleast 1 or 2 people that has their profile reseted.
Whether it be a person who&#39;s played for a day or a person that just started.
is there anyway to solve this?
or just prevent it by making an auto reseter with a message saying &quot;log out in 1 minute or account may be in risk of being reseted!&quot;?
or logging out wouldn&#39;t make a difference?
Well any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks. :D</description>
