    <description>[b]DONT FLAME IF U HAVE NEVER HEARD OF HIM THANK YOU [/b]

STAMFORD, Conn., June 25, 2007 – World Wrestling Entertainment was informed today by authorities in Fayette County, Ga., that WWE Superstar Chris Benoit, his wife, Nancy, and his son were found dead in their home.  Authorities are investigating, but no other details are available at this time.
 
Chris was beloved among his fellow Superstars, and was a favorite among WWE fans for his unbelievable athleticism and wrestling ability.  He always took great pride in his performance, and always showed respect for the business he loved, for his peers and towards his fans.  This is a terrible tragedy and an unbearable loss.
 
WWE extends its sincere condolences and prayers to the surviving members of the Benoit family and their loved ones in this time of tragedy.

The official, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, said Benoit hanged himself in the weight room of his suburban Atlanta home.

The 40-year-old wrestler, his wife and 7-year-old son were found dead at 2 p.m. on Monday in three separate rooms.

Celebrity gossip website TMZ.com is reporting further details, including that Benoit may have strangled his wife on Saturday and waited until Sunday to smother his son in his bed.

Benoit was supposed to participate in a pay-per-view World Wrestling Entertainment event in Houston over the weekend but cancelled because of a family emergency.

TMZ.com mentions one source as saying that Benoit was text messaging friends during Sunday&#39;s WWE &quot;Vengeance&quot; Pay-Per-View program and may have been watching the show with his son before killing him.

ABC&#39;s Mike Von Fremd told Canada AM from outside Benoit&#39;s home in Fayetteville, Ga., Tuesday that friends of Benoit said they received &quot;curious text messages&quot; from the wrestler on Sunday morning.

The WWE notified authorities after hearing from friends who received the curious messages, the wrestling organization said on its website.

It was then that police discovered the body of the wrestling star; his wife Nancy, 43; and son, Daniel.

Lt. Tommy Pope, the lead investigator with the Fayette County Sheriff&#39;s Department, told ABC News that the &quot;instruments of death were located on scene.&quot;

Authorities also told AP that they are investigating if steroids may have played a role in the apparent murder-suicide.

More details are expected to emerge Tuesday after an autopsy is conducted.

However, Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard said toxicology results may not be back for weeks or even months.

WWE career

World Wrestling Entertainment aired a three-hour tribute show to Benoit instead of its usual &quot;Monday Night RAW&quot; TV show on the USA Network.

&quot;I am deeply saddened over the loss of Chris Benoit,&quot; WWE Canada president Carl DeMarco said on the organization&#39;s website.

&quot;My heartfelt thoughts and sympathy go out to his parents and family. My relationship with Chris has extended many years and I consider him a great friend. Chris was always first-class -- warm, friendly, caring and professional ... one of the best in our business.&quot;

Benoit, 40, was born in Montreal and grew up in Edmonton, graduating from Archbishop O&#39;Leary High School.

He began his career in 1985, starting with the famous Hart family of Calgary, who operated Stampede Wrestling.

He won the world heavyweight championship at Wrestlemania XX. In response, Edmonton declared &quot;Chris Benoit Day&quot; on April 15, 2004.

Benoit was known as &quot;The Canadian Crippler,&quot; in part because he broke another wrestler&#39;s neck in 1994. Another nickname was the Rabid Wolverine. His signature move was the &quot;Crippler Crossface.&quot;

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Benoit&#39;s wife, known by her stage name &quot;Woman,&quot; managed several wrestlers.

The couple met when her then-husband wrote a script depicting an ongoing love affair between the two on World Championship Wrestling, the newspaper said.

Benoit has two other children from a prior relationship.

<p>The June 25, 2007 edition of RAW was scheduled to be a three-hour memorial to “Mr. McMahon”.
