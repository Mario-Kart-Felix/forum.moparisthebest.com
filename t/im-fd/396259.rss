    <description>will u help me?

here is the story:

ok not really but kinda. i have been talking to this one girl for like 3 months; she lives 2200 miles away and she doesnt want a long distance relationship. i didnt care if it was long distance or not i wouldnt cheat on her if it was, i dont really need the physical relationship part i mean id like it but at this time it just isnt possible.

we were talking a lot my family and her friends all thought we were dating even though we kept telling them no we arent we just like talking to each other. well like 2 weeks ago she told me she cant do this anymore b/c it hurts her that i cant be there and hold her and stuff. :/ so we both cried it kinda felt like a break up even though we were never dating. so she asked me to promise that when i graduate college that her and i would try to get together(even if she found a guy there to date [im guessing she would leave him for me when it came time idk exactly]). so i promised.

so for the past 2 weeks we have only been talking a fraction of what we use to, which kinda hurts b/c i enjoyed talking to her, and our conversations are short and boring now.

my ex started talking to me friday, so we talked, and she is waiting on someone as well, so she suggested that we could date until one of us were able to get with the person we were waiting on. so we both asked those ppl if it was alright. the girl i had been talking to said she only cared if it was my ex. so i told her it was my ex that was wanting to date me, and she said i dont care its ur choice, if my ex hurts me again she doesnt want to fix me again. she also said she would talk to me far less then she currently has been.

so im weighing the costs and benefits, then think, hey whats going to happen we arent talking much now what is even less going to do, plus if i get hurt again ill just suck it up and be a man. so i asked my ex that what if that person she was waiting on finds out and u lose them, she said they wouldnt find out; i also asked another question but i honestly cant remember what it was. but those last 2 questions made my decision. so i told my ex yes.

so now she isnt my ex anymore shes my gf. and we are both getting our feeling back for each other and now she doesnt care about that other person and just wants me now :/ and she wants to try to make us work this time. and im kind of want to try again with her too.

im feeling sick now b/c now both of them want me. i dont want to hurt either of them. everytime i think of either of them getting hurt i feel like puking, b/c i care about both of them. if i hurt either of them im going to be hurt myself. the one girl has had a pretty rough life and i dont want to hurt her anymore then she has been( shes a cool, and pretty girl).

my problem is idk what to do. im sure its to far for anyone to not get hurt. i have a cousin who says leave my gf b4 it gets way farther. i have an old teacher who says i should stay with my gf and forget the other girl.

there are multiple solutions but most end with someone hurt. :(

1. find someway to tell the one girl i think im going to try to be with my ex, and tell her im sorry im not worth it and she deserves someone better than me.

2. i break up with my gf

3. see if the dream my mom had when i was talking to the girl, comes true. ( she had a dream that got had both girls. that was when i was just talking to the one girl, and thought i was over my ex. both girls are bi but the one girl doesnt like my ex b/c she hurt me. plus i dont think i could live like that, some guys would say hell ya, but im like i just want to focus on 1 girl.)

4.i die, but then both girls and everyone i know would be upset

5. the one girl gets over me and then no one gets hurt.

6. my gf stops being in love with me, and we break up, i wouldnt care if i get hurt as long as neither of them get hurt.

list other options i have, what i can say if the first option should be my choice, and/or what u think i should do.

thx for ur posts. i figure i need a solutions fast to prevent excess pain. :(

note: i didnt mean to be stupid, i guess i shouldnt let my heart decide stuff like that. also i promised my gf that we would be together after i graduate from college first, months b4 i knew this one girl.

edit: i hope to get serious responses but know sometimes this community doesnt post them. if u want to flame me for being stupid u can, i deserve it. also im thinking if i thought(which at that time she was certain she was going to stay with her ex) there was a chance i would get with my ex i may have not got interested in the girl.</description>

<p>Well, you’re back with your ex, would you mind telling us what went wrong the last time?</p>

</aside>
<p>im not back with her anymore. shes with a girl b/c she believes that girls wont hurt her and thinks every guys is the same including me even though she knows im not. shes still in love with her ex(so many names i want to call him). she believes he was serious about getting married to her, and that her accusing him of cheating was the only reason why he broke up with her.</p>
<p>to me if he was serious about her he would have never told her she could date girls while they were together, and even set her up with a girl he choose, they wouldnt have kept breaking up and getting back together every time they fought. he told me b4 her dated her that he pretty much just wanted her for sex. and she believes that they will have a chance again after he gets out of basic training, b/c he said he just needed time to think about it.</p>
<p>what went wrong last time is i gave her too much freedom, and i didnt lay down the law. i let her talk to an ex of hers(at the time i had no clue they were exs, she told me they were just friends) and she asked him if he wanted her back, so guess what she left me the last week b4 i graduated high school, after 5 months(actually that was our 5 months that week). it was her loss b/c he broke her heart for the second time.</p>
<p>and this time when we dated it wasnt much like we were dating, i mean the only thing that changed is we kissed again. b/c anytime i wanted to do anything she would think about her and her ex doing the same thing and get sad… so i nvr held her, nothing. idk dating her actually made things worse for me anyways.</p>

              <p>Well right now im single. my ex wants to date girls, im want to tell her to forget it b/c the girls shes dating all live in the same area and live a distance away from her, closer than me but still. all shes had is drama with them. as far as i know shes single, and she was worried her ex gf is going to kill herself b/c she said she was and she hadnt txted her back in an hour. i went to sleep and didnt worry about it b/c i figured when we all woke up everything would be ok and everyone would still be alive. she said she was thinking about dying, and i told her if she did anything to herself it would hurt me and probably kill me.</p>
<p>so ive been talking to other girls <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> woot. one is a model and vocalist in her own band, shes turning 21 this year, ive actually hung out with her in person(so far the only thing we’ve done is smoking a hookah at a hookah bar), shes like a 15 min drive from me, shes nice and mature, she told me she has a crush on me, and im starting to get one for her.</p>
<p>the other girl is a friend of my ex, they arent too good of friends according to my ex, but this girl is pretty turning 18 this year, and ive only talked to her on fb, and txt. the 17 year old and i seem to be talking a lot more than the 20 year old, but she lives the farthest away from me, even farther than my ex. but still im still in love with my ex.</p>
<p>i think the 17 year old has feeling for me(she txted me all day yesterday, and shes started txting me, and usually i have to txt who ever to start talking to them, also she keeps bringing up that she thinks i like her alot) but she keeps saying no she doesnt, i find the 17 year old very interesting, last night when she said she was going to bed she told me she loved me bestie. which confused me i didnt know i was her bestie.</p>
<p>well ill bbl.</p>
<p>edit: god i hate every site that is too lazy to implement a more secure method of having photos on the web. oh no its too hard and complicated to do anything but make things bypass-able b/c u want to keep a naming convention… there are smarter ways to keep a collection of photos to one account, and to me the way facebook implemented that is a flaw in design. js. well I should of known u could track someone through facebook pics… w/e should have just uploaded to dropbox. rant done.</p>
<p>i would show the other girl but ya i feel like i hurt her too bad so ill just let her be. i could put a pic of me up but that doesnt really matter.</p>
<p>also if u feel like suggesting anything u can, but i decided i guess im just going to live and learn. so idk if this thread should die or not, idk if i should keep it up to date.</p>
<p>if u think the thread should die then just post that as ur comment.</p>

<p>edit: well im hoping its just a break. but she broke up with me. guess im going to wait for her to mature more… this is the third time shes broke up with me for the exact same reason. she started talking to an ex then she gets feelings for them and leaves me for them… w/e hopefully im still available when she realizes what she had and wants me back.</p>
<p>latest: back with her. i told u she changes her mind a lot.[/quote]<br>
Are you fucking stupid? [sarcasm] I usually go back to the girl that has broken up with me <span class="bbcode-b"> 4 </span> times. [/sarcasm] OVER THE SAME REASON.<br>
Maybe she’s not for you, I dont know. Just generally when someone breaks up with me four times, and especially for the same reason, I take that as a hint it’s not going to work out.</p>
