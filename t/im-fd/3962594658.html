        <p>Simple answer to this question, I give a lot of real life advise to my Armenian friends and most of them work out pretty good. Basicly, the online girl obviously lost intrest in you, she stopped talking to you like she used to. That means, she does not want you anymore. I know she asked you to be together with you and promise that BUT that was when she was very vulnerable and wanted something to make her feel better. Now, she’s over it and if you went there you’d probably end up alone. So, first of all, this second girlfriend, dumping her is not nessecary. I’d keep her BUT it depends why she became my ex-girlfriend, if she fucked another guy, cheated in general. Then I’d fuck her one last time and dump her. If you guys got broken up over something stupid then I’d say let’s give it another shot. The first girl won’t get hurt because she probably moved on without you knowing it. The second girl, if she does get hurt, then she totally deserves it. Your welcome.</p>

The guy is 19 years old so I’m asuming he has a sexual relationship with her 2. I’m not saying fuck the girl if you’ve never fucked her before.</p>

        <p>What happened to the youth of today? Long distance relationships use to be when you dated someone in your town and they moved away for a little but you still wanted to date them, but they would be back later.

<p>Simple answer to this question, I give a lot of real life advise to my Armenian friends and most of them work out pretty good. Basicly, the online girl obviously lost intrest in you, she stopped talking to you like she used to. That means, she does not want you anymore. I know she asked you to be together with you and promise that BUT that was when she was very vulnerable and wanted something to make her feel better. Now, she’s over it and if you went there you’d probably end up alone. So, first of all, this second girlfriend, dumping her is not nessecary. I’d keep her BUT it depends why she became my ex-girlfriend, if she fucked another guy, cheated in general. Then I’d fuck her one last time and dump her. If you guys got broken up over something stupid then I’d say let’s give it another shot. The first girl won’t get hurt because she probably moved on without you knowing it. The second girl, if she does get hurt, then she totally deserves it. Your welcome.</p>

<p>exactly iv nvr had sex. she has. im wanting to wait for marriage, but if she wants it sooner i will. she didnt physically cheat on me, but verbally by talking to an ex of hers asking if he wanted her back, which that ended up with her leaving me for him. she just told me today day she feels like she needs to get laid but she hates taking virginity and doesnt want to take mine. i honesty dont care about sex, i just want her. she is awesome.</p>

<p>i didnt date the one girl. i have mine set to ppl around me like 25 miles or something like that, but she was the one who find me. im pretty sure my gf and i are going to try to stay together. we are having a rough time right now b/c she wants her ex back, i want her to be happy so if he wanted her back they could get back together, but he pretty much hates her. idk how im going to tell the myyearbook girl except i hope shes been looking for a nice guy where she is and right now that we should just be friends.</p>

<p>That’s where your stupidity comes in. Just “fucking” isn’t going to get you anywhere in the future. It certainly isn’t going to make yourself feel better. “I just fucked a girl who cheated on me, fuck yeah I’m awesome.” No, definitely not. You’re actually taking the risk (even with a condom) of becoming a father just because you wanted revenge. I would rather just let her go instead of trying to fuck with their head.</p>

        <p>well its all over now. yesterday was a horrible day. tried killing myself. i may have lost my ex forever idk yet. we were talking. she wanted to talk to that other girl. so i asked, even though i knew it would be a bad idea. they never talked but i told my ex(gf @ the time) that she said some stuff(should have never told her that), so she wanted to know. i didnt want to tell her but i did. i fwdd the msgs which had language and also she said she was head over heels in love with me(which made me feel like shit since i wanted my ex). so i thought my ex and i were over.</p>
<p>so ya i did what i said at the beginning. she told me should would think about us staying together, so i stopped. then she called the cops on me over that. so i was freaking out b/c i thought i was going to get in trouble. so her and i were still together. things got cleared up. then i started talking to the other girl. the other girl said she was going to still be in love with me, so i was feeling like shit having a choice of staying with the girl i would die for who probably doesnt care about me, or wait for the girl who says she is head over heels in love with me.</p>
<p>i was thinking the relationship wouldnt last much longer plus i thought she was thinking she was going to break up with me. so i was going to, but i couldnt just in case she did care able me. so both girls communicated on fb. so right now im single but have the one girl who wants me. i mean i want to try with this one girl(b/c shes nice, and mature, where as my ex has a lot of growing up to do) but i so badly want my ex back its not even funny. idk if this really shows how badly i was depressed but i ate at hooters last night and about started crying in the middle of the restaurant.</p>
<p>lesson: if u want one girl and u know how she is, u should stick to ur instinct, or w/e. like i knew my ex changes her attitude all the time, so i should have just waited and not made bad decisions. in the beginning where i told her what the other girl said, and also later when things settled down i should have just seen if my ex and i would have made it.</p>
<p>if the girl and i dont work out then i hope that maybe my ex and i can truly(i mean it was just a week and a day) try again in the future. ive seen my ex better than she is now, so i know that is in her.</p>
<p>this thread can die now. but if ppl want to discuss it feel free.</p>
<p>edit: dang things are changing everyday. update it seems like i may be ending up with my ex, and the other girl is out of the pic. idk yet ill keep u up to date.</p>
