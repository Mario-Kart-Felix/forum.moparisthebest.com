    <description>This is my 1st tutorial so hope I did well lol

Well I was messing around today on my server and was like wow I really wish I had soul split that would be awesome, so I got to thinking how do people add it I wonder. So I messed around for about 30minutes and after combining the &quot;smite&quot; code and a portion of the code used to &quot;heal&quot; yourself after eating food I came up with this..Enjoy hope I help :)
(NOTE : This only gives the affect, this tutorial will not teach you how to add the overhead icon or animations! Simply the actual effect!)


Ok well we all want to add soul split to our server right? I mean really its like the best prayer of real runescape and it would be really fun to have on your server right? Well I am going to attempt to show you how to make soul split.

..::READ THIS::..
I am using the paladino base so commands may differ depending on your base!
1st off we go to the PlayerCombat.Java file located here...

src &gt; paladino76 &gt; rs2 &gt; player &gt; combat &gt; PlayerCombat.Java

Open it with notepad.
press CTRL + F
search for Smite

It should come up with something like this
[code]					if (p.smitePrayer &amp;&amp; en.skillLvl[5] &gt; 0) {
						en.skillLvl[5] -= (int)(playerHitDamage / 4);
						en.frames.setSkillLvl(en, 5);
					}[/code]

Now I am going too explain some of the parts of the code now..
en.skillLvl[5] -= (int)(playerHitDamage / 4); is what lowers prayer points when some1 does damage to you with smite activated. the part that says &quot;playerHitDamage / 4&quot; means 1/4 of their hit will be removed from your prayer points.

Now the code for healing yourself after eating is
[code]p.updateHP(22, true);[/code]
Now we have to combine the two somehow.

[code]					if (p.smitePrayer &amp;&amp; en.skillLvl[5] &gt; 0) {
						en.skillLvl[5] -= (int)(playerHitDamage / 4);
						p.updateHP(playerHitDamage / 4, true);
						en.frames.setSkillLvl(en, 5);
					}[/code]
that is what you shall change your code too. the &quot;p.updateHP(playerHitDamage / 4, true);&quot; segment of the code just says 1/4 of what the player hits will be added to their HP.
Now your not done yet! After entering this code search for smite again(using CTRL + F) and fix every code with smite to be like that!

Now if you want to add an overhead icon I am not sure but I suppose you could find a picture somewhere of the overhead icon of soul split and replace your smite icon with it but i&#39;m not sure. As for animations I don&#39;t have the slightest clue :)

I hope I helped, leave a post below if you have any errors / need help!</description>
