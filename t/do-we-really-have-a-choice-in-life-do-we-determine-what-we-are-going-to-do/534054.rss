    <title>Do we really have a choice in life?/ do we determine what we are going to do?</title>

    <description>I started thinking about this today after reviewing my notes on string theory in ESS, Earth Space Science, and just realized if their are infinite number of universes with each one of these universes have one thing different from each other..does it mean that what ever we are doing is already determine?  Lets say in one universe I play Runescape and in the other universe I play World of Warcraft. In the other universe I was already dentin to play World of Warcraft since that is the small change from that universe to the other.  Get what I&#39;m saying?  With this idea does it mean what ever we do in this universe is already set-up of what ever we are going to do?  So are choices in life is already been determine and no matter what are mind thinks its already set what we are going to choose.   Do you guys agree with this?</description>

If you could predict everything you could predict your own future, correct? But if you could predict your own future, could you change your own future? For you would have predicted yourself trying to change your future.</p>

We are all a product of our environment and if you can predict the environment and the effect on people then you can predict every event.</p>
