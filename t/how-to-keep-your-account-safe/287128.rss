    <title>How to Keep your Account Safe</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-keep-your-account-safe/287128</link>
    <description>We love Runescape. It’s a great game and there’s always so much to do. Previously, and in the future, i’ll write about many tips and tricks that you’ll be a world-wide renowned player if you follow them all. However, there are people out there who are too lazy to do the work for themselves. Some of you reading this article may have had your Runescape account stolen by hackers and thieves. If you’re ever asked to participate in helping to steal Runescape passwords, please report it to Jagex immediately. There’s no fun in getting accounts illegally, and it’s morally wrong. Also, you could be liable for legal action if you do so.
    We have to protect our accounts from these hacking teams and I’m going to list some ways you can protect yourself. Some of these things are obvious, others, not so much…
1.) Don’t ever tell someone your password. Nobody. Remember, they have your password already on their server, so why would they need to ask? The only person who would ask is someone stealing accounts.
2.) Your account will never be locked in 24 hours if you don’t provide your password. Trust me. If RuneScape wants to ban you, they won’t wait 24 hours.
3.) Only login to Runescape on the official RuneScape site. The official site is www.runescape.com. Never follow a link to the site, because links can easily be faked by anyone. Check the address bar every time you play. Also, you should manually type in the URL in the address bar when you do play.
4.) Get an anti-virus software, even a free one. Not only will this protect your account, it’ll protect your computer. i recommend *G Anti-Virus Free Edition.
5.) Get an anti-spyware program, even if it is free. We recommend Lavasoft Ad-Aware Free Edition. The reason for this is that hackers can use spyware to see what you type as your password on your computer.
6.) Get keylogger protection. Lavasoft does this, but if you can get a special program for preventing keyloggers, your PC will be a lot safer.
7.) Don’t go for scams that say that they will give you tons of free items, or free gold. Don’t go for the email scams either. Let’s review the e-mail scam in detail. Here’s what an uninformed Runescape player might do.
Remember to stay safe while playing.</description>
