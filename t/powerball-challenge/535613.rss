    <description>Using whatever programming of your choice....

Here is a dump of all the previous powerball numbers pulled. 
http://www.powerball.com/powerball/winnums-text.txt

[b]Output which number has been pulled the most amount of times.
Output which number has been pulled the least amount of times.
Output the odds of your number sequence being called.
Be creative.[/b]

You will notice that after 1/18/12 6 numbers are pulled instead of 7. You can deal with this, how you wish. (should really be ignored)
01/18/2012  50  34  29  06  44  28 
01/14/2012  41  30  10  36  38  01  5</description>

<p>Kinda messy, but whatever.</p>
<p>Edit: oops, just realized <span class="bbcode-i">vect.emplace_back(std::make_pair(ball, 0));</span> should read <span class="bbcode-i">vect.emplace_back(std::make_pair(ball, <span class="bbcode-b">1</span>));</span>. my results are off by 1</p>
<p>[quote=“Rodgerwilco, post:1, topic:535613”]Output the odds of your number sequence being called.[/quote]That can be calculated using a static formula, the odds don’t change based on what you guess.<br>
From what I can tell, you guess 6 numbers ranging from 1-59… so that’s</p>
