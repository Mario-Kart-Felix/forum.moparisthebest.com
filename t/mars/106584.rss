    <title>Mars</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mars/106584</link>
    <description>Yesterday i had free time before school so i watched the Science channel as it interests me, a lot.
On it was a program called &quot;Exploration Mars&quot;, or something similar.

It talked about Mars in the (near) future and how in as soon as 2020 people could live there.
First they were going to send a ship with no-one on it to Mars that would create fuel using Mars&#39;s atmosphere and the chemicals in it to refuel another ship containing humans for the journey back (Less weight).
That&#39;s for exploring purposes.

What interested me was how they talked about making Global Warming happen on Mars to increase the temperature and alter the pressure of its atmosphere so humans would soon be able to live on mars only having to wear oxygen suits. (Not the giant pressure suit things). The temperature increase would melt frozen Ice and water would start spreading, again (they&#39;re assuming)- After that they were considering taking plant life there and growing tree&#39;s and such as the chemicals there are perfect for plants and oxygen for humans. It&#39;d take a while to grow them all and spread the oxygen- But it&#39;s quite amazing.

Then maybe take animals there from our world and ect. If there were any organisms frozen in the ice or such, they may have a chance of living again. There&#39;s your Martians. :P

They showed a detailed version of what it might look like, looked really cool.
Like a 2nd Earth.

Very interesting.
Just thought it&#39;d be a worthy discussion.

What do you think about this?</description>

<p>How can they make it free? The 400 Billion goes towards all the building and stuff.<br>
The first project, they wanted to build a space station on the moon, build the rocket there and then send it to Mars.</p>
<p>But they’ve made it way smaller, now, and it’s a direct launch from earth.</p>

<p>At first it was a giant mission by Nasa, but would have costed an estimate of 400 Billion- So they made it smaller, it was denied again, then smaller, denied.<br>
Then these two guys made it as small as possible but very efficient. (Sending 1 rocket for refueling, ect)</p>

They did say that growing the Tree’s and such would take a long time- But, for what it’s worth it’s worth it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I’m just repeating what scientists have said with the frozen organisms thing, you never know.</p>

              <p>Yesterday i had free time before school so i watched the Science channel as it interests me, a lot.<br>
On it was a program called “Exploration Mars”, or something similar.</p>
<p>It talked about Mars in the (near) future and how in as soon as 2020 people could live there.<br>
First they were going to send a ship with no-one on it to Mars that would create fuel using Mars’s atmosphere and the chemicals in it to refuel another ship containing humans for the journey back (Less weight).<br>
That’s for exploring purposes.</p>
<p>What interested me was how they talked about making Global Warming happen on Mars to increase the temperature and alter the pressure of its atmosphere so humans would soon be able to live on mars only having to wear oxygen suits. (Not the giant pressure suit things). The temperature increase would melt frozen Ice and water would start spreading, again (they’re assuming)- After that they were considering taking plant life there and growing tree’s and such as the chemicals there are perfect for plants and oxygen for humans. It’d take a while to grow them all and spread the oxygen- But it’s quite amazing.</p>
<p>Then maybe take animals there from our world and ect. If there were any organisms frozen in the ice or such, they may have a chance of living again. There’s your Martians. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>They showed a detailed version of what it might look like, looked really cool.<br>
Like a 2nd Earth.</p>
<p>Very interesting.<br>
Just thought it’d be a worthy discussion.</p>
<p>What do you think about this?</p>
