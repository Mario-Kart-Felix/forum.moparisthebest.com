    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;At least 14 people have been killed in a shooting at a Batman film premiere in the US city of Denver.

About 50 people have been injured in the incident, police say.

Witnesses say a gunman wearing a gas mask opened fire at the cinema complex in Aurora, at a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises.

There are reports the gunman released a smoke bomb during the incident. Police say they have one suspect in custody. Many ambulances are at the scene.

The Swedish Medical Center, not the area&#39;s main hospital, told the BBC it had received three gunshot victims.

A witness told 9News that during a shooting scene in the film he heard loud bangs and a lot of smoke and initially thought they were live special effects put on by the cinema.

Projectiles came through the wall from the neighbouring theatre screening, the witness said.

CNN quoted one witness saying: &quot;A guy slowly making his way up the stairs and firing - picking random people.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

so how are those concealed carry laws working out?</description>

<p>there may be plenty of guns on the street, guns were after all legal in the UK for a time and still are today, and some places in Europe don’t completely ban guns however that isn’t necessarily the issue, much of Europe has an extremely small homicides per 100k people from guns even in European countries where people CAN carry guns legally</p>
<p>removing guns from a general population in any country is absolutely ridiculous, petty criminals (may) hand over their gun however organized criminals sure aren’t, look at Australia for one of countless examples</p>

<p>I think USA is just kind of fucked when it comes to gun crime. It could be a culture thing and not really the legality of guns. Removing all of the guns would be ideal, but <span class="bbcode-b">impossible</span>. The closest they could do is offer massive cash incentives for handing in guns but that still wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>Crazy people on a shooting rampage can happen anywhere. There was one in here in Canada very recent, 2 people dead 23 wounded. There was the shooting and explosives in Norway. And probably all sorts that I haven’t heard of since that.</p>

But if everyone has a gun, then noone will be stupid enough to rip one out in the first place.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>That is a very stupid comment, please read what you wrote again.</p>
<p>Humans have something called emotions which overtake the brain and often the human makes decisions that the rational brain would not do because they were overshadowed by the drive of the emotion. E.g.</p>
<p>“Bitch gawn and cheeeted on me dint sheee, lets cap her ass”</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>“Im a clever guy, I have an idea, a game I would like to play, I’m the joker and I’m going to fuck up your film”</p>
<p>Im sorry but it really angers me when people think that giving guns to every citizen is a good idea, it makes NO sense what so ever, not even for the personal defence effect. If you are worried about personal defence give people a low-power tazer enough to scare the attacker.[/quote]</p>
<p>Only in america would they think MORE is better.</p>

</aside>
<p>That is a very stupid comment, please read what you wrote again.</p>
<p>Humans have something called emotions which overtake the brain and often the human makes decisions that the rational brain would not do because they were overshadowed by the drive of the emotion. E.g.</p>
<p>“Bitch gawn and cheeeted on me dint sheee, lets cap her ass”</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>“Im a clever guy, I have an idea, a game I would like to play, I’m the joker and I’m going to fuck up your film”</p>
<p>Im sorry but it really angers me when people think that giving guns to every citizen is a good idea, it makes NO sense what so ever, not even for the personal defence effect. If you are worried about personal defence give people a low-power tazer enough to scare the attacker.</p>

<p>How can you be so sure? This guy knew the gun laws in his state, so he knew there was a possibility that some of the people in the theater had a gun. Yet he didn’t mind, he was prepared for it.</p>

<p>All I can imagine is the next time this happens they all pull guns out and shoot each other.

Such a tragic event would settle the gun law issue. Tragic but could help people in the future.</p>

<p>At least Switzerland is responsible and doesn’t send it’s people to be killed in wars. The swiss citizens enjoy going to the compulsory 3 months of yearly army service because they know they aren’t going to be killed and they get paid. Other countries have shit backwards. I reckon if one person dies in a war, that is one too many and war should be banned. Or at least pasteurized.</p>
