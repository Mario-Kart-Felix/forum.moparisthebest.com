CubeBuilders is a server with friendly players and staff members.

How to play? Create or join a faction, gather players, and build together! Many factions are invite only, so ask in chat or better yet - create your own faction and ask new players to join you. Faction owners and moderators can claim land, which is protected as long as your faction power doesn&#39;t fall below the number of land chunks claimed.

The server is in development stages at the moment.  Yes, we may be looking for some staff, but if you ask right away when you first login, it would decrease your chances of even being considered given a staff position later on.
