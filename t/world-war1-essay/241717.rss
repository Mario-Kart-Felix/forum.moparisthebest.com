    <title>World war1 Essay</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/world-war1-essay/241717</link>
    <description>Hi.  I need to write up an essay about the causes of world war1, i think ive finished it but im just posting it here incase theres a way i can improve it

&lt;blockquote&gt;The actual causes of the war are more complicated and is still debated by historians today.  However, the first known cause of the world war 1 was rivalries,
Germany was a new country, and wanted to become more powerful then other
stronger country’s such as Britain.  This caused hatred between Germany and Britain.
It states in a reliable source that World War 1 was directly triggered by the assassination of the Austrian prince, Franz Ferdinand. Austria blamed Serbia for the assassination and its wasn’t long until Austria had declared war on Serbia, this is when the alliances were formed. An alliance is an agreement made between two or more countries to give each other help if it is needed. When an alliance is signed, those countries become known as Allies.  The Russian army, one of Serbia’s ally’s, prepared to help Serbia defend itself whilst Germany, Austria’s ally, begins to head towards France, Russia ally and then Britain declared war on Germany. This then linked to the Arms Race. 

The Arms Race was a race to build the biggest Army, Navy and equipment such as
Tankers and armoury for the Battle ahead. All countries except Britain and Germany
Were trying to build the biggest army anyone had ever seen were as Britain
and Germany were trying to Build up there navy as Germany wanted the Biggest
Navy to beat Britain.

This was the start of the World War 1.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This essay needs to have these things in it

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. I can support both sides of an argument with examples and justify and overall judgment
2. i can explain how several causes/reasons link together to make an event happen.
3. i can use a range of sources, which i have questioned, to justify my overall judgment.
4. i can explain why there are different versions of what happend  in the past
5. My answer uses a wide range of sources to produce an original piece of work. A line of argument throughout. Infornation to reach a fully supported judgment and mentions how reliable the sources are.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If mine is missing some of them things above could you tell me and maybe a way to fix it?  I would really appreciate it because im struggling, thanks.</description>

<p>Your current work lacks detail and a severe amount of depth. It looks like you have done very little research and barely no sources have been used. If you hand that in, i can guarantee you will struggle to pass.</p>

<p>I think you need to develop your structure first.</p>
<p>First thing you need is an introduction. In your introduction you need to give the point to your argument.<br>
You can start off by saying… world war one was started because… . the reason there are different versions of the storyline is because… .</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s good to start off with something that grabs the reader’s attention such as giving a rhetorical question to start off,<br>
or mention the word “you” to make the reader think that the writer is talking to them, etc.</li>
<li>Don’t write too much on the introduction, just a plain description of what you’re trying to point out in the argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you start with the main paragraphs<br>
1 - causes and reasons leading to world war one<br>
2 - why there are different versions of it<br>
these are your points you’re trying to make, correct?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>so you should start on your first main paragraph by saying “Firstly, world war one is caused by… the article…Wikipedia… (or whatever) states that… this happened…” etc (which links your sources into your essay)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then you should start on your next main paragraph by saying “Secondly, there are many versions of the war because… the article…Wikipedia… (or whatever) states that… this happened…” etc (which links your sources into your essay)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and in those paragraphs you say something to oppose your side of the argument, but rebuttal it (to balance both sides)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you should give the direct link of the sources (don’t just say “this source states world war one was caused by…”, say “the non-fiction text [Name of Text] by…[Author] states that world war one was caused by…”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then when you finish explaining everything, you go to the conclusion (new paragraph) where you give a summary of your essay.</p>
<p>And finally you have 1 more paragraph on your judgment after the conclusion and give an opinion of what you think caused it and why there are different versions of it, according to your sources.</p>
<p>Don’t just give a whole lot of information on how it started and why there are different versions of it. If you want to do a proper essay structuring is important.</p>
<p>Intro<br>
Main Paragraphs<br>
Conclusion<br>
Judgment</p>
<p>Unless your educator told you to just get info about it…</p>
