    <description>How do you correctly add stuff to cases?

And could someone explain a little bit about how they work, and what exactly a case is.

E.G:
[code]case 4755:
   {
       entergw();
   }
break;[/code]

how would I add say, a command into that?

because i&#39;ve tried multiple ways and keep getting various errors such as orphaned case (what does that mean)

Thanks.</description>

<p>First,</p>
<p><code>case 4755:
   {
       entergw();
   }
break;</code></p>
<p>First, the 4755.<br>
This is the object or tab or whatever you want to click and make it do something for you.<br>
So for example, if I wanted to make a chest give me, lets say, 5000 gp, I would put this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">case chestid</code></pre>
<p>The “chestid” would obviously be changed to the chest’s id.<br>
Now for the 5000gp part, You would add</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">addItem(995, 5000);</code></pre>
<p>This part tells your server to give you 5k gp.<br>
now, lets say you want it to send you a message.<br>
You would now type in something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sendMessage("You recieve 5000gp");</code></pre>
<p>This part of the code tells it to send you a message that you recieve your gp.<br>
Now say you wanted to end it.<br>
You would put</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">break;</code></pre>
<p>So all together it would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">case chestid:
addItem(995, 5000);
sendMessage("You receive 5000 gp!");
break;</code></pre>
