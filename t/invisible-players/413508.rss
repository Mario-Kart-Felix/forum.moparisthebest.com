    <description>Hello everyone.
I have just recently made a webclient for my pi server. The source was erased-pkz. I have about 10 on and we are getting this glitch where we can&#39;t see each other. We can see the dot on the minimap and when you walk over them you can right click them, but you cant see the character. I have been messing around with it and it seems like it has something to do with the custom models. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.</description>
