    <title>Want to Be part of something amazing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/want-to-be-part-of-something-amazing/527027</link>
    <description>im just looking for someone to basicly, help me &quot;moniter&quot; the community, and advertise, and help out!. No java experience needed!

You will get staff position, maybe even co-owner.

Server is fully ready to be hosted.

I would like the server to become one of the &quot;log in and pk&quot; but also a big part skilling too!.   The way it is now, is skilling, offers just as much economical support, as pking does. There is Pvm, and i will be adding more as time goes on, and we get more players. Pictures will be posted today. We have Custom Pk Sets, that you can buy with in-game gp. There is also hidden items sets, that when equiped together, will give advantages as 5% more damage or 5% faster exp.
