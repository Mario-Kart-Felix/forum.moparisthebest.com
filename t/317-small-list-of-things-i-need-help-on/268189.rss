    <description>Hey everyone, thanks for viewing, i really need some help on the following topics, any help would be much appreciated. 

-Prayer, when I try to bury any bone it says &quot;nothing interesting happens&quot; is their like a code or something I need in client.java? or do i need a specific handler for it? Like the player handler etc.

-Basically making an object work as a portal, like the gangplank in Port Sarim, I want people to be able to click this and get sent to Karamja, I still havent found a fix for this.

-Turning a player into an Easter rabbit, I know it&#39;s funny, but on one server I played on if you clicked &quot;death&quot; you would turn into a &quot;grim reaper&quot; and it was cool.

-Making more than one mining rock work, only a few in my server work, and i want them to have infinite stock as well.

-Same thing with trees, they fall, and I don&#39;t want them too, I want their to be an infinite stock as well.

-Making gates (etc.) open, I have been trying to find a way to make certain gate open, and they are not working, they don&#39;t open,

-Adding emoted to me server, when i click an emote button (yes, no jump for joy, etc.) nothing happens, any way to fix this?

And that&#39;s just all i can think of at the moment, again if you can help, I will rep you
thanks so much for helping if you do :p</description>
