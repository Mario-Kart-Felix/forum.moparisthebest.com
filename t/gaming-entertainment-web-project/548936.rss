This thread will be updated heavily overtime (it&#39;s late atm, might finish in morning).

Here&#39;s some media to hold off before I add more information shortly, domain hasn&#39;t been bought yet nor an official one decided yet until tomorrow.

Some notable features that may interest you, more coming soon:

[ul][*]YouTube video submissions (upload your clips to a page where other users submit videos and get your channel more feedback)
[*]Graphics Designing section
[*]Computer programming section (includes RSPS in a single category though, RSPS wasn&#39;t the main target of this community)
[*]Live stream submissions (upload your twitch channel to a page where other users can watch you straight off of Gaming Entertainment)
[*]Site Dumps (netflix logins, cracked applications, etc..)
[*]18+ section (well, yeah.)[/ul]



The main concept of the community is for YouTube broadcasters, Twitch Streamers, Sports fans (those who watch online), several more concepts of users to be happy to stay in 1 community rather than serach around the internet for a community for what they want separately.
Finding PPV&#39;s for sport events can be very tedious and annoying based on 80% of sites want you to do a survey, etc.. This simplifies that completely.
