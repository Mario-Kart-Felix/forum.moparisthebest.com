A commercial bulk e-mailer whom critics consider the most prolific producers associated with &quot;spam&quot; agreed to change a few procedures to settle a case filed by Verizon wireless Internet Services. The settlement announced Friday allows Alan M. Ralsky of West Bloomfield Township to remain in business, but restricts his distribution regarding unsolicited bulk e-mail advertising and marketing, The Detroit News documented. Neither Ralsky nor Verizon would comment extensively on the settlement, stating confidentiality agreements. Yet Bobbi Henson, a spokeswoman for that Reston, Va.-based Verizon Web, called it a significant scenario.  &quot;People should see this and think twice about sending junk e-mail on our lines,&quot; Henson said. Your settlement permanently pubs Ralsky and his company, Extra Benefits LLC, from delivering bulk e-mail, derided while spam by critics, on any of Verizon&#39;s sites, which reach A single.64 million buyers in 40 claims. Ralsky also must pay this business an undisclosed fine. &quot;Ralsky is one of the better-known spammers out there,&quot; said John Mozena of Grosse Pointe Woodlands, vice president of the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail. &quot;The greater the spammer that is catagorized, the happier were.&quot; But Ralsky stated he will continue sending bulk e-mail. Verizon&#39;s suit, created U.S. District Court in The state of virginia, had sought to shut him down, searching for as much as $37 million. Your lawsuit alleged Ralsky double paralyzed its community in 2000 simply by sending millions of e-mails. &quot;It did not happen,&quot; said Ralsky, 57. &quot;I admit absolutely no liability ... and I have no idea of if any information has been sent from all&quot; with the settlement. Ralsky said he doesn&#39;t send out offers for pornography or any emails to people who show they don&#39;t want them.
