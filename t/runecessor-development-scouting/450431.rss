    <description>Hey guys, I am one out of 3 members of Runecessors current development team and we are looking for more people. so far there is Me (Michael), Logan, and Jason.

We need some people who can help us completely remaster runescape back in 2006, we will also be creating a Runescape 2010 server but that will be to come later, anyways if you would like to be apart of our development team then send me a private message, also we need people who know how to code and know how to do it well, no noobies please, thank you!

P.s: We have a bunch of people on our youtube and twitter who are waiting for our server to come out we started advertising last week and already have 53 people who are waiting for the server to be released. We use to run a big server that had over 200 players but when our old development team got tired of coding, or had no time, we shut down and broke up, but 3 of us stuck together and are ready to start another successful server, and we have some of our old players waiting. so be apart of something great! again if you are interested send me a Pm, if you are apart of our development team you will receive part of our donations, we will divide the donations up evenly depending on how much we make.</description>

              <p>Posting a link to your forums to apply? Yeah, I don’t think so. You include no info in this, just a bunch of stuff praising a non-existent server, and providing false hopes of getting paid. You guys sound like a bunch of idiots, who need someone to boss around and have him do all the work. You say the old server shut down because the development team got tired of programming, I chucked when I read that, sounds like you guys couldn’t figure out how to do anything, so you gave up. You guys sound like some of those “pro coders” I hear so much about, if your so good, why do you need developers? Just please, go ahead and show yourself out, the “LOGOUT” button is just at the top of the screen, good day to you.</p>

Money.<br>
A lot of players.<br>
Being staff over all those players.</p>
<p>What els is there really, it will be a fun experience for our developers and in the long run they receive money, what more can you ask for.</p>

<p>You might want to re-word that.</p>
<p>Also, take the Website advertisement out of your thread. Some ideas or something to actually make people want to Develop for you might be a good idea as well.</p>
