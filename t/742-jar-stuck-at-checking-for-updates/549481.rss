    <title>742 jar stuck at checking for updates</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/742-jar-stuck-at-checking-for-updates/549481</link>
    <description>Hey, so I&#39;ve been trying forever to figure this out. Essentially what happens is this, when I jar the client it doesn&#39;t load. But when I load it through server+client bats it works... the ips are on 127.0.0.1. I&#39;m well aware that portforwarded ips do this. Anyway, something else I noticed is that when I run the run.bat in my server files with the jarred client it works. I can only assume that means its not loading the server. Also, it did this before I updated cache. Old cache was 718. 
Thanks in advance</description>
