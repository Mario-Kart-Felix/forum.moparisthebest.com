    <description>Well i am at school and i am trying to connect to a hamachi server, but i dont have hamachi on this comp. so i think that is the reason for it not to be connecting, so i was wondering if there were any (no-ip) servers online now, please tell me i need a good server to connect to.

(i checked the server status page and have no clue how to use it)</description>
