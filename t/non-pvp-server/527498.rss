    <title>Non-Pvp server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/non-pvp-server/527498</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking to download a server that I can play at home offline.
It would be awesome if it had a few quests and lots of skilling. Nothing that would make you level up instantly. Basically something as close to an offline version of the real game as possible. Much appreciated!</description>

              <p>The majority of servers are all pvp based and have it to where you can max skills way too easily. I never did pvp in the real game, I was always a skiller.<br>
A game where you would have to mine and smith your own armor to raise your combat level to fight npc’s would be amazing.</p>

              <p>I don’t understand how people would want to play offline alone especially when their hosting.</p>
<p>Just download a random server from the downloads section, the majority will work fine.</p>
