        <p>Iran confirmed Saturday this had successfully examined a medium-range missile, a weapon capable of reaching Israel, its traditional enemy Irak, as well as thousands of You.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia. Iran express television quoted Protection Minister Rear Adm. Ali Shamkhani while saying that the rocket with a range of 900 miles was screened on Wednesday simply by Iranian experts “without any international support.” This report runs despite U.S. intelligence reports which repeat the missile is regarding North Korean source. Iran said it was warranted in the test, quoting "changes that have taken place close at hand and far away,Inches and noting that will for Iran to establish a long-lasting peace, some investment in “defense facilities” was necessary. Abc News Correspondent Brian Martin reports that the missile flew more than Six hundred miles before detonating. Your missile, when completely operational, would multiple the range of the Iranian toolbox.“It’s just a test, however, if they, obviously when they were to develop a medium range missile it may change the regional stableness dynamics in the Middle East,” said Us president Clinton. “This would allow them to strike many countries at the center East, including Israel, elements of Turkey and areas of Russia as well,” said Pentagon representative Kenneth Bacon.In addition, Ough.S. troops based in Saudi Arabia could be hit, but the real concern, says nuclear skilled Gary Milholin, is what this specific missile says concerning Iran’s intentions.“This missile is incredibly strong evidence of Iran’s dedication to get the bomb,” he said. "No one has ever built a bomb that goes this much and is this incorrect except to carry a new nuclear warhead."Just last week the blue ribbon screen warned that so little is known about Iran’s fischer weapons program, the actual U.S. is not likely to know whether the Islamic republic has the bomb until afterwards.Reported by Jesse Martin©1998, Cbs television studios Worldwide Inc., All Rights Reserved  <a href="http://jasadmag.com/ralphlaurenpolo.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ralph lauren polo shirts </a><br>

President Bush described as “uncivil” Sen. Edward Kennedy’s critical remarks in the administration’s policies in Irak.Kennedy said last week the case for going to conflict against Iraq would have been a fraud “made up in Texas” to give Republicans a political increase.

Bush said that as they respected Kennedy, the senator “should not need said we were attempting to bribe foreign nations.”“I don’t mind people trying to pick separate my policies, which is fine and that’s honest game,” Mr. Bush said from the interview that will air Monday night. "But, you understand, I don’t think we’re serving our country well by allowing the discourse to become consequently uncivil that people say — employ words that they really should not be using."Kennedy’s comments, section of the drumbeat of criticism Mr. Bush has received of late from Democrats, had been described as a “new low” through House Majority Innovator Tom DeLay.Kennedy sacked DeLay’s comments, saying that again GOP leaders are avoiding questions about Mister. Bush’s policies "by attacking the actual patriotism of those who question them."Kennedy, D-Mass., elaborated in his comments in a interview on Msnbc, saying the supervision is announcing the $8.5 billion mortgage loan to Turkey, which country will then supply military assistance throughout Iraq.“It didn’t have to become this way,” he was quoted saying. “We wouldn’t have to be providing these billions of dollars to these countries in order to … coerce them or even bribe them to send out their troops within, if we’d tried it the right way, if we’d gone to the Us, if we had created an international constituency.”  <a href="http://erad.org/newweb/michaelkorsoutlet.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://erad.org/newweb/michaelkorsoutlet.html</a><br>
Mexico’s government insisted Thursday that a black childrens favourite with exaggerated characteristics is a historical image who deserves to always be celebrated on a shipping stamp — and that U.S. leaders charging racism do not completely understand Mexican culture.The nation’s postal service soon released a series of 5 stamps depicting "Memin Pinguin,Inch a child’s character coming from a comic book started in the 1945 that is certainly still published within Mexico.In California, the White Home objected, saying that “racial stereotypes are generally offensive no matter what his or her origin.” Your Rev. Jesse Jackson branded the stamp “an insult” and asked Mexico to withdraw it from the market.Withdrawing the stamps would probably make sure they are more desirable to enthusiasts and increase their worth, say U.Utes. collectors.But Diane Aguilar, a spokesman with regard to President Vicente Fox, mentioned the comic book features promoted understanding as well as family values for years and deserved to become enshrined on a stamp."It would seem strange to me this celebration of Mexican culture and Mexico’s post office’s toast to Asian cartoonists is misunderstood,Inch he said.    no previous site next    1/4  <a href="http://www.erad.org/guccioutlet.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">gucci outlet online</a><br>
