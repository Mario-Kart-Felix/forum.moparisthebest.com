    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lokoscape-317-new-server-looking-for-co-developers/387946</link>
    <description>[code][/code]Hey my name is Nico obviously and i would like to have a development team for my server and just so were straight the developers will get certain spots on the server. (EX: One who helps the most will get the highest rank) Also i have a vps already a a vbulletin forums (paid for not hacked) so we will be using those for the server :)

Ok so the base im using is the &quot;project no-doze&quot; heres the link - [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,483627.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,483627.0.html[/url] its a sql server where all the character files, bank, friends, npcs almost all of the server is on XXAMP. You can add npcs, shops all that with out even updating the server. And im a pretty experience coder i own the server called &quot;lokoscape&quot; and im a coder for &quot;foescape&quot; foescape was on the top three servers of the week on rune-l0cus. It has about 150 players and that is a 562 server so is lokoscape. Ive been coding for about 4 years now and i know this account dosent have alot of rep/post its becuase this is another account my other account is named: ladesman witch dosent have alot of rep either but it has alot more posts. So now im going to post some pictures about the server!

Heres some features of the server (keep in mind this is what i got off of the main post so i didnt make anything on this server yet i would like a team first)

Features (Please note, There is only 1 combat system, Which runs both player and npc Hence Entity based. This also includes much more other bits that can be possible to run for player and npc.)

Skillcapes - All skillcapes have there actionDelays meaning they are set to busy whilst preforming the emotion. If a player
is under attack while doing a emotion the hits will be delayed until they are set to not busy.
ForceWalker - Allows you to walk a character to a certain location { x, y, z }.
JailSystem - puts players in a temporary cell while the admin decides what they will do with the player.
Ship travelling - Use the main ports to get around the map.
Walk to then perform action - implemented for objects and npcs.
ActionManager - An tick based system purposly built for this server.
All Animations, Damages, Graphics and teleporting players have a built in delay system to allow delayed actions for the tasks mentioned.
FightPits - viewing orbs work and player is invisable.
Object Click system - Stores the last clicked object in an array so it can be used for skills to get certain details about the object.
Personal pets - Atm you can only get the pet via ::buypet command, follows you around and picks up valuable items for you! plus stackable items.
Market system (SQL) based - used to buy and sell items between players.
All specials work.
All spells are autocastable.
saves last combat mode for melee and ranged.
saves if you had autoretaliate on and running, will highight opon login if needed.
npcs can walk futher than 1 square and can also change paths.
no more bs npc drops, if you know what i mean, well you know what i mean. Fixed.
Hits are stored into an array, then each cycle of the server it will check if its time to hit, if all the hit masks are 
currently used it will hold the attack for another cycle until it can hit the player.
Real busy system, like how rs has, stops players from doing certain things while in busy mode.
Glory teleporting - all real rs teleport locations, goes from (4) to uncharged.
ring of duelling - all real rs teleport locations, goes from (8) to dust.
ring of recoil.
ring of life.
dharok degrading.
multi combat zones.
PVP zones. (lumbridge) with a red skull.
regular pking zones with a normal skull.
tea stall thieving, gives exp and tea.
trading with some dupes fixed.
begun on duel arena - has duel sign, challenge option and all options work. no staking yet.
all prayers work with thier correct features, all features effect the player how they should.
bone burying.
all food eating.
potion drinking.
Pk token system, used to buy PVP items from store.
100% accurate rs combat formulas, ranged and melee, with all the extra addons that you could ever need. (tested)

NPC COMBAT - Entity based.

Basically everything you could ever need for a combat system (Extremly nice combat)
Complete npc tile system - no more standing on npcs whilst fighting (Exact to rs)
Complete combat system with implemented SQL features to allow for ease of use when adding npc styles, attack levels etc..
7 different combat states - Npcs can use 7 types of combat while fighting a player if selected
Magic and ranging uses the Entity based system.
Making a npc use a complete magic spell is as simple as putting in the spell id that you want it to use.
Complete attack/defence system.
delayed hits.
no sidewards fighting in melee combat, either the npc or the player will move to the horizontal/vertical postion suitable.
no standing on a npc whilst fighting - will move around until they are not on each other, they cannot attack while standing on each other either.
and the rest that rs has.


PLAYER COMBAT - Entity based.

All spells - All correct animations/gfxs - All correct hits, Hit/splash system.
I have created a &quot;Magic book&quot; which basically contains every spell in it, useable for both npcs and players!.
Ranging, complete projectiles with arrow dropping and deleting, supports all knifes/darts/javelins/axes.
All ranging styles change the delay for the attack.
If you are using longranged you get defence exp aswel and range and hp exp.
Saves your last combat mode, for both ranging and melee weapons, highlights correct combat tabs, this includes when you log in.
No possibility to use a combat mode that a weapon doesnt have, If you were using str mode and switch to whip it will change your combat mode to attack
, normally on rs it will switch to the closest combat mode that the weapon has, i decided pures hate switching to whip and it being controlled thus being the 
reason why it will change it to attack.
player following
basically everything pking on rs has this has.
Multi hitting spells, hits up to 9 players or npcs or BOTH, if standing next to the enermy.
All experience given in the server can be increased by two variables to make it fast to altar all skills experience rate or combat experience rate. 
SQL Benefits
Can add npcs into the server without resets.
Can update shops without resets.
Can update npc drops without resets.
Players need to register to play, registration page download provided at bottom of page.

              <p><code></code>Hey my name is Nico obviously and i would like to have a development team for my server and just so were straight the developers will get certain spots on the server. (EX: One who helps the most will get the highest rank) Also i have a vps already a a vbulletin forums (paid for not hacked) so we will be using those for the server <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Ok so the base im using is the “project no-doze” heres the link - <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,483627.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,483627.0.html</a> its a sql server where all the character files, bank, friends, npcs almost all of the server is on XXAMP. You can add npcs, shops all that with out even updating the server. And im a pretty experience coder i own the server called “lokoscape” and im a coder for “foescape” foescape was on the top three servers of the week on rune-l0cus. It has about 150 players and that is a 562 server so is lokoscape. Ive been coding for about 4 years now and i know this account dosent have alot of rep/post its becuase this is another account my other account is named: ladesman witch dosent have alot of rep either but it has alot more posts. So now im going to post some pictures about the server!</p>

<p>Heres some features of the server (keep in mind this is what i got off of the main post so i didnt make anything on this server yet i would like a team first)</p>
<p>Features (Please note, There is only 1 combat system, Which runs both player and npc Hence Entity based. This also includes much more other bits that can be possible to run for player and npc.)</p>
<p>Skillcapes - All skillcapes have there actionDelays meaning they are set to busy whilst preforming the emotion. If a player<br>
is under attack while doing a emotion the hits will be delayed until they are set to not busy.<br>
ForceWalker - Allows you to walk a character to a certain location { x, y, z }.<br>
JailSystem - puts players in a temporary cell while the admin decides what they will do with the player.<br>
Ship travelling - Use the main ports to get around the map.<br>
Walk to then perform action - implemented for objects and npcs.<br>
ActionManager - An tick based system purposly built for this server.<br>
All Animations, Damages, Graphics and teleporting players have a built in delay system to allow delayed actions for the tasks mentioned.<br>
FightPits - viewing orbs work and player is invisable.<br>
Object Click system - Stores the last clicked object in an array so it can be used for skills to get certain details about the object.<br>
Personal pets - Atm you can only get the pet via ::buypet command, follows you around and picks up valuable items for you! plus stackable items.<br>
Market system (SQL) based - used to buy and sell items between players.<br>
All specials work.<br>
All spells are autocastable.<br>
saves last combat mode for melee and ranged.<br>
saves if you had autoretaliate on and running, will highight opon login if needed.<br>
npcs can walk futher than 1 square and can also change paths.<br>
no more bs npc drops, if you know what i mean, well you know what i mean. Fixed.<br>
Hits are stored into an array, then each cycle of the server it will check if its time to hit, if all the hit masks are<br>
currently used it will hold the attack for another cycle until it can hit the player.<br>
Real busy system, like how rs has, stops players from doing certain things while in busy mode.<br>
Glory teleporting - all real rs teleport locations, goes from (4) to uncharged.<br>
ring of duelling - all real rs teleport locations, goes from (8) to dust.<br>
ring of recoil.<br>
ring of life.<br>
dharok degrading.<br>
multi combat zones.<br>
PVP zones. (lumbridge) with a red skull.<br>
regular pking zones with a normal skull.<br>
tea stall thieving, gives exp and tea.<br>
trading with some dupes fixed.<br>
begun on duel arena - has duel sign, challenge option and all options work. no staking yet.<br>
all prayers work with thier correct features, all features effect the player how they should.<br>
bone burying.<br>
all food eating.<br>
potion drinking.<br>
Pk token system, used to buy PVP items from store.<br>
100% accurate rs combat formulas, ranged and melee, with all the extra addons that you could ever need. (tested)</p>
<p>NPC COMBAT - Entity based.</p>
<p>Basically everything you could ever need for a combat system (Extremly nice combat)<br>
Complete npc tile system - no more standing on npcs whilst fighting (Exact to rs)<br>
Complete combat system with implemented SQL features to allow for ease of use when adding npc styles, attack levels etc…<br>
7 different combat states - Npcs can use 7 types of combat while fighting a player if selected<br>
Magic and ranging uses the Entity based system.<br>
Making a npc use a complete magic spell is as simple as putting in the spell id that you want it to use.<br>
Complete attack/defence system.<br>
delayed hits.<br>
no sidewards fighting in melee combat, either the npc or the player will move to the horizontal/vertical postion suitable.<br>
no standing on a npc whilst fighting - will move around until they are not on each other, they cannot attack while standing on each other either.<br>
and the rest that rs has.</p>
<p>PLAYER COMBAT - Entity based.</p>
<p>All spells - All correct animations/gfxs - All correct hits, Hit/splash system.<br>
I have created a “Magic book” which basically contains every spell in it, useable for both npcs and players!.<br>
Ranging, complete projectiles with arrow dropping and deleting, supports all knifes/darts/javelins/axes.<br>
All ranging styles change the delay for the attack.<br>
If you are using longranged you get defence exp aswel and range and hp exp.<br>
Saves your last combat mode, for both ranging and melee weapons, highlights correct combat tabs, this includes when you log in.<br>
No possibility to use a combat mode that a weapon doesnt have, If you were using str mode and switch to whip it will change your combat mode to attack<br>
, normally on rs it will switch to the closest combat mode that the weapon has, i decided pures hate switching to whip and it being controlled thus being the<br>
reason why it will change it to attack.<br>
player following<br>
basically everything pking on rs has this has.<br>
Multi hitting spells, hits up to 9 players or npcs or BOTH, if standing next to the enermy.<br>
All experience given in the server can be increased by two variables to make it fast to altar all skills experience rate or combat experience rate.<br>
SQL Benefits<br>
Can add npcs into the server without resets.<br>
Can update shops without resets.<br>
Can update npc drops without resets.<br>
Players need to register to play, registration page download provided at bottom of page.</p>
