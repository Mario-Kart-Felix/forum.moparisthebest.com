              <p>[quote=“Micro Soft, post:3, topic:247781”]Okay, like Legend said, just edit someone else’s client. To go a little further in that, you can edit what it says. For example, lets say the client originally said ‘Servername Client’, and you wanted to change it your name. For that, you can go into the Frame_Sub1.java file. Then, you should see something like setTitle(“Servername Client”); In the middle of the quotation marks, add your server name, or whatever you like. Save that, and move on. Next, go into Client.java. Search for something this. System.out.println(“Loading Servername, please wait…”);. Edit it as you like. Next, search for this Class30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub4_1272.method381(128, “Servername client is loading, Please wait.”. Again, edit it as you would like. Next search for this 0xffff00 until it says something to do with the server that created it. Edit it to whatever you’d like it to say.</p>
<p>Next, find this in the client folder. Class30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub1. There, you can edit the client picture. Search for this in there. Image image = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().createImage<br>
Then you should see something like SERVERNAME.jpg, or whatever. If you created a picture, you can add it there. Remember to add the picture in the client folder aswell. The picture HAS to have the dimensions of 765 X 504.</p>
<p>Hope this helped.[/quote]</p>
<p>number 1) change title just go into GUI.java</p>
<p>Other than that, its all good</p>
