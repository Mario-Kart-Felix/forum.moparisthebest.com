    <description>[b][u][size=50pt]How to make a client[/size][/u][/b]

Let me rephrase that for the annoying people who look for every little flaw in someones work..

How to leech a client


for the noobs:

how to dl a client base and change everything so it looks like you made it



I wouldnt consider it leeching IF its a client base

*PLEASE NOTE: I tried to make this extremely noob friendly, not advanced in anyway at all
first you need a base client

For you to fully understand this tutorial i suggest you download my client...

http://www.mediafire.com/?pjs1zm2cmej

then unzip the file to wherever

now open the folder and you see where it says &quot;client.java&quot;? 
open that...

now hit ctrl+f and type in brendan

change everything to your name that comes up

but give me credit

now file, save, close.

open frame_sub1.java and change brendansmiths client to whatever you like


that will be what it says at the top of the window...
ex. at the top of my browser it says Start new topic - mozilla firefox


now heres the easy part

before you can do this you need GIMP 
google GIMP free download


i dont feel like looking for it


find an image you want to be the background

save it

place it in the client folder and rename it to background.png

something will come up saying, &quot;this file already exists, do you wish to replace it&quot;? hit yes


now hit compile, and it should work..

now hit run and....



CONGRATULATIONS


YOU SUCCESSFULLY LEECHED YOUR FIRST CLIENT!!

NOTE: THIS IS EXTREMELY NOOB FRIENDLY NOT ADVANCED IN ANY WAY JUST TO START OFF NEWCOMERS!!</description>

              <p>You should have some more documentation on the background image, because it needs to be certain size and flipped over half way. Other than that, it’s okay… It’s just how to download a client.</p>
