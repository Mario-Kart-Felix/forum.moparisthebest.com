    <description>
I took the shop code and created chests for public use. Chose not to use the bank code for shared chests but starting to regret it. Made changes to the chest window and separated the shop and chest packets. Added packets 100, 101, and 102. Clickable text for giving items to the chest is still on the left side of the window but it properly highlights when mouseover of text occurs. Need to add bank-like item quantity amount buttons for giving and taking from the chest. Began adding the amount in the chest item take/give packets but more needs to be copied from the bank window sections. Goal is to have the &quot;1, 10, 100, 1K, 10K, All&quot; as well as to fix the location of the hyperlink text since you have to click all the way on the left for giving items to the shop.
