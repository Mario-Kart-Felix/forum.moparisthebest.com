    <description>I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;ve treied everything in the Book to Compile. But my compiler finds an Invalid file.

Here&#39;s The ~Compiler.edit~     


[code]@echo off
cd ../src
echo Compiling all files....
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_14\bin\javac.exe&quot; -cp  -d ../build/ ./net/com/espeon/*.java
pause[/code]

Now that Code must have a flaw because When I try compiling this is what comes out.

[code]Compiling all files....
javac: invalid flag: ../build/
Usage: javac &lt;options&gt; &lt;source files&gt;
use -help for a list of possible options
Press any key to continue . . .
[/code]

I need some better results, please help me as soon as possible.
