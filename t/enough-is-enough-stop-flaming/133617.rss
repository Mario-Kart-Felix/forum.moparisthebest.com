I swear you people have nothing good to say, don´t say it people like you are disquisting where are your servers thats right you all ain´t got any cause you can´t make one. Well at least I made one long ago before banned but it might not have been good but I made one evilscape v1 was it. I like this server looks good, yes the house thing you might have seen before its from a long time ago on this forums there was a tut on it, I released the tut on a diffrent forums with my own recoding making it easier to add to servers. Also as for client, no one ever makes there own client 100 percent from nothing. they all use like soulscape v1 or v2. I am sick of people who think there all that cause they can talk but can´t do the freaking walk. Why don´t all of you take a gun and blow out what remains of your tiny brains. Oh and as for making weps look like there being healed like in rs, I haven´t come aroung to any server that does that so why don´t you shut the hell up. O well i know how to make it look like its being healed right, as a matter of fact i made it right in evilscape v2, but that gives you not right to post trash like that. You people are so freaking disguisting. Oh yea and this is a SERVER DEVELOPMENT/HELP if all of you half brained freaks can´t read DEVELOPMENT this is exactly what this topic is about! So all of you need to shut your holes up!</p>

<p>You have no proof that none of us have servers. I am actually working on one, but few people know about it. Am I the only one? No, I believe there are others working on servers of their own. Also, if you took the time to read, only one or two people have had negative comments on this, but they never said that it sucked. As for the tutorials, a server stuffed full of tutorials that other people have made is horrible. One last thing: If he doesn’t want criticism, then he shouldn’t post here. He really shouldn’t expect everyone that reads this thread to have 100% positive thoughts about it. People are entitled to their own thoughts, and they are allowed to speak them, just not in a manner that breaks the rules. So, with all that said, I leave you with this:<br>
Learn to spell. Learn to use grammar.[/quote]I couldnt understand it at all</p>
