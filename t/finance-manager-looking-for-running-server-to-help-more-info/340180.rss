    <description>Hello i am James/EvolutionJB,

I played private servers for several years (2-3), i spent a certain amount of time coding, hosting and released a server once although it wasn&#39;t of great standard. After two years of Official Runescape (I currently have 4 accounts but that&#39;s not really improtant at the moment)

Basicly i have done my GCSE in Business and passed with an A*;
i am going straight into business and i am starting off here and i will eventually expand. I will guarantee a certain time i will stay with you for.

I am looking for a Running server which could benifit from my help. I will help in many ways such as...

- Cheapest, most Effective way to spend your budget (If you have chosen to have one)
- Keep track of your Costs and profits and calculate certain calculations
- Advertisement
- Make [b]money[/b]!
... and more

If you are intrested contact me... Jamesbarker123@hotmail.co.uk
- We will disscuss further if you like by msn please don&#39;t leave questions on this Topic.</description>
