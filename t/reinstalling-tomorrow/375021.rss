    <title>Reinstalling tomorrow</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reinstalling-tomorrow/375021</link>
    <description>Currently I run Fedora 13 with an XP VM. Tomorrow I plan to install Ubuntu 10.10 and Windows Seven (for gaming), both on separate partitions.

I am currently copying the whole volume of my Fedora install onto the portable hard drive overnight and tomorrow I&#39;ll see to it.

I&#39;m thinking:

[ul][li]150gb Ubuntu[/li]
[li]100gb spare (fedora or something)[/li]
[li]200gb Windows 7[/li]
[li]500gb data[/li][/ul]


What filesystem should I use for the data partition? I would like it to be encrypted, but no so encrypted that when my computer breaks I cannot access the volume.

I have a portable hard drive, which probably won&#39;t be portable. When I start my studies though, I&#39;d like it so when I plug it in (win7 and linux) it&#39;ll automagically copy the changed/added files onto the data partition, maybe even sync the important shit into my dropbox. I also need the portable hdd encrypted in case it&#39;s stolen.

Both of the drives are 1tb.

I&#39;ll be grateful if you could help me decide :)</description>
