    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-client/48380</link>
    <description>Ok. I want my own client that people can play in. How do i do this. If someone can help. i will give them 60% of the credits.
if someone does it, or has one, or makes one say (Feel Freescape) i will give them 99.9% of the credits. The other 00.1% to me for adverting. lol No i will give 100% of the credits to the person. Thanks in advance</description>
