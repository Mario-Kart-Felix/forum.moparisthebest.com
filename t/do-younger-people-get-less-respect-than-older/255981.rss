    <title>Do younger people get less respect than older?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/do-younger-people-get-less-respect-than-older/255981</link>
    <description>Well, I am not going to lie about my age. I am 13 years old. I do my best to act like I am older and not be a faggot. I have been with moparscape for quite awhile(shorter than I though wow) and well, anyway, here is my question.

Do you think that ages like me would get less respect on these forums (MITB, Mopar) than a oh...16 year old would?

I would think it would depend on behaviour and maturity. I try to be as mature as I possibly can, and I have only acted like a retard a few(maybe in the 20s...) times. I know quite a bit of people who act like me though(That is a good thing kind of =P)

Age doesn&#39;t really make a different to me..A 13 year old can say what a 16 year old says and a 13 year old can know what a 16 year old knows.

Anyway, post your opinion.

              <p>I somewhat base it on age, i think a 10-17 yr old is unstable/unreliable, can change thier mind on things too fast, cry like little bitches and the rest of the shit you see from prepubescent kids over the internet.</p>
<p>However there is 1 in 20 younger ones that i meet, that act more mature than my self at times, i respect those ones and nothing more. (I’m almost 20 btw)</p>

Please make some sense before arguing. I honestly have no idea what the above quote is supposed to mean. (Not a flame, being honest.)</p>

              <p>[quote=“Chassy13, post:1, topic:255981”]Well, I am not going to lie about my age. I am 13 years old. I do my best to act like I am older and not be a faggot. I have been with moparscape for quite awhile(shorter than I though wow) and well, anyway, here is my question.</p>
<p>Do you think that ages like me would get less respect on these forums (MITB, Mopar) than a oh…16 year old would?</p>
<p>I would think it would depend on behaviour and maturity. I try to be as mature as I possibly can, and I have only acted like a retard a few(maybe in the 20s…) times. I know quite a bit of people who act like me though(That is a good thing kind of =P)</p>
<p>Age doesn’t really make a different to me…A 13 year old can say what a 16 year old says and a 13 year old can know what a 16 year old knows.</p>
<p>Anyway, post your opinion.</p>
<p>—Flame war starts here—[/quote]Respect is based off of maturity, something I have have lacked in the past. I judge on character and personality, not age.</p>
