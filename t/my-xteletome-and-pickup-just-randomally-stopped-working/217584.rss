    <description>Anyhelp on what to do to fix these problems?

I was playing and then randomally I decided to do ::pickup 00378 1

*Raw lobby*

And I noticed it wouldnt work. &gt;.&lt;

Then I went to tele my buddy to me and it didnt say &quot;Error player doesnt exist&quot; or what ever
It just didnt say anything and it didnt do anything.
As with the pickup nothing happened.</description>

              <p>They were all working, then when I noticed they went I look at the run box for my client and It had a big error. Then when I x’ed it out and started it back up it was gone. So I dont know. I tried the X and x thing no luck.</p>

              <p>the pickup: there must be something wrong in the code but i find that hardly possible since you were just <em>randomly</em> picking up a raw lobby.<br>
the teletome: you either typed an invalid name, your friend logged out or there must be something wrong in the code.</p>

              <p>try doing ::pickup 0378 1           and about the xtele it happends some time make sure u do ::xteletome NAME and not ::Xteletome the x is like capital on the 2nd one… just keep trying will work and this may be happen if user is offline</p>
<p>btw maybe the owner changed the playerrights to do it… what i mean is if u were admin maybe the owner made em for owners only or for him only…</p>
