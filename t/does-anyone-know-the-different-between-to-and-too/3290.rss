    <title>Does anyone know the different between to and too?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anyone-know-the-different-between-to-and-too/3290</link>
    <description>I noticed this a lot on the forums and everywhere else for that matter. Does anyone know the different between the word &quot;to&quot; and &quot;too&quot;?

Here it is everyone. SO GET IT RIGHT! lol. The word &quot;to&quot; is used when you want TO go somewhere, you want TO hump something, you want TO eat something, or whatever.

You DO NOT use the word &quot;to&quot; when you mean also. Such as... 
Oh my god! I eat food [u]to[/u]! - WRONG!!!!

Oh my god! I eat food [u]too[/u]! - CORRECT!!!!

You use the word TOO with TWO o&#39;s when you are saying &quot;also&quot;. I do this too, he did this too, she played with that too. 

Just thought I would clear it up, since it was bugging the hell out of me.

I hate that word!!! Pl0x… WTF!!! It’s please. God I really hate LEET altogether. Yeah and the other guys are right, “ur”, “there”, and “know” vs “no” is also agravating. Why don’t people know more, are their brains there?</p>
<p>Do they know the difference between the word “then” and “than”?</p>
<p>Then = Next … Example: Then, we beat the shit out of this kid.<br>
Than = Comparison … Example: That kid was bloodier than my mom giving birth.</p>
