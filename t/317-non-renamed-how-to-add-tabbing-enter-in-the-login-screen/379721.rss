    <description>[b]Difficulty:[/b] [i]1[/i]
[b]Time:[/b] [i]5 minutes[/i]
[b]Client type:[/b] [i]Non-renamed/refactored[/i]
[b]Edited classes:[/b] [i]Client.java, Applet_Sub1.java[/i]
[b]Notes:[/b] [i]This tutorial is aimed for people who like to use the tab and enter keys for inputting information, rather than having to click the login button.
This will work with ANY non-renamed (using it for renamed would be practically no work at all, but I can&#39;t seem to find a good renamed client, PM me a download link if you so desire a renamed version).
This is not a repost, but simply something I did after finding no help in this forum.[/i]


In order to actually make this work, we are going to have to find where key actions are handled in the client. This is located in [i]Applet_Sub1.java[/i]. Scroll down until you find the [i]keyPressed[/i] method. It should look like this:

[code=java]public final void keyPressed(KeyEvent keyevent)
    {
        anInt18 = 0;
        int i = keyevent.getKeyCode();
        int j = keyevent.getKeyChar();
        if(j &lt; 30)
            j = 0;
        if(i == 37)
            j = 1;
        if(i == 39)
            j = 2;
        if(i == 38)
            j = 3;
        if(i == 40)
            j = 4;
        if(i == 17)
            j = 5;
        if(i == 8)
            j = 8;
        if(i == 127)
            j = 8;
        if(i == 9)
            j = 9;
        if(i == 10)
            j = 10;
        if(i &gt;= 112 &amp;&amp; i &lt;= 123)
            j = (1008 + i) - 112;
        if(i == 36)
            j = 1000;
        if(i == 35)
            j = 1001;
        if(i == 33)
            j = 1002;
        if(i == 34)
            j = 1003;
        if(j &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; j &lt; 128)
            anIntArray30[j] = 1;
        if(j &gt; 4)
        {
	anIntArray31[anInt33] = j;
            anInt33 = anInt33 + 1 &amp; 0x7f;
        }
    }
[/code]
Now then, this works by obtaining the code of the key pressed on the keyboard, and then assigning variable [b]j[/b] the code itself. For future reference, we are going to be using the key codes [b]9[/b] for the [i]tab[/i] key and [b]10[/b] for the [i]enter[/i] key. If you so desire, you can replace the lines below:
[code=java]
        if(i == 9)
            j = 9;
        if(i == 10)
            j = 10;
[/code]
with:
[code=java]
        if(i == KeyEvent.VK_TAB)
            j = 9;
        if(i == KeyEvent.VK_ENTER)
            j = 10;
[/code]
[b]NOTE:[/b] This is [b]optional[/b], and does not impact the tutorial in anyway. It is just for easier reference in the future.

Since we want a simple way to obtain the key code, without interfering with [b]anIntArray31[/b], we are going to create a new public variable. Scroll to the bottom until you see where all of the variables are declared. At the very bottom of this list, before the [b]}[/b], add:
[code=java]
public int key;
[/code]
This is the variable we will be using to check whether the user has pressed the enter or tab keys. (Quick note: You can use this to basically check for any key press in any class that either extends or imports Applet_Sub1.java)
Scroll back up to the [i]keyPressed[/i] method, and find this portion of the code:
[code=java]
        if(j &gt; 4)
        {
	anIntArray31[anInt33] = j;
            anInt33 = anInt33 + 1 &amp; 0x7f;
        }
[/code]
This is where we will be assigning the variable [b]key[/b] its value. Now then, this portion of [i]keyPressed[/i] assigns the array [b]anIntArray31[/b] the key&#39;s code that was pressed. The array, and its key are both private and handled by [i]method5[/i] (I may update the tutorial to use this method, but I wanted to keep this as simple and easy to understand as possible). Now then, in the same fashion that [b]anIntArray31[/b] obtains its value, we are going to assign [b]key[/b] its value like so:
[code=java]
        if(j &gt; 4)
        {
key = j;	
anIntArray31[anInt33] = j;
            anInt33 = anInt33 + 1 &amp; 0x7f;
        }
[/code]
There is one more line we must add to the code. Scroll up to the [i]run[/i] method, and find these lines:
[code=java]
        method11(0).addMouseListener(this);
        method11(0).addMouseMotionListener(this);
        method11(0).addKeyListener(this);
        method11(0).addFocusListener(this);
[/code]
After [b]method11(0).addFocusListener(this);[/b] add this:
[code=java]
method11(0).setFocusTraversalKeysEnabled(false);
[/code]
I will explain its function later on, when we add tabbing.
Congratulations, if you followed my instructions, we are now done editing [i]Applet_Sub1.java[/i]. You can save and exit and open up [i]client.java[/i] now.
Now we are going to give the enter key its functionality, search for this:
[code]
super.anInt26 == 1 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &gt;= i1 - 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &lt;= i1 + 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &gt;= k1 - 20 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &lt;= k1 + 20
[/code]
If you searched correctly, you should see this:
[code=java]
                if(super.anInt26 == 1 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &gt;= i1 - 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &lt;= i1 + 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &gt;= k1 - 20 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &lt;= k1 + 20)
                {
                    anInt1038 = 0;
					method84(aString1173, aString1174, false);
                    if(aBoolean1157)
                        return;
                }
[/code]
Now then, this if statement simply finds whether you have clicked within the bounds of the login button, and if you did, it begins the login process. In order to just press enter instead of clicking the button, we must find whether or not the user has pressed the enter button. Remember that I had said that the enter key&#39;s code is [b]10[/b]? We are going to use that by asking whether [b]key[/b] (The variable we declared in [i]Applet_Sub1.java[/i]) is equal to 10. In order to do this, we must make sure that the user can both either press the button [i]or[/i] press the enter key to login. This is done by using the [b]||[/b](OR) operator. We are going to add this operator right after [b]super.anInt28 &lt;= k1 + 20[/b] like so:
[code=java]
                if(super.anInt26 == 1 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &gt;= i1 - 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &lt;= i1 + 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &gt;= k1 - 20 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &lt;= k1 + 20 || )
[/code]
However, this is obviously not the only thing we have to do, keeping the if statement that way will generate an &quot;Illegal start of expression&quot; error. Now then, after the || operator, we are going to check whether [b]key[/b] equals 10.
Unfortunately, [b]key[/b] is not declared in [i]client.java[/i], so just using key == 10 will generate an error as you compile. In order to &quot;grab&quot; the key variable from [i]Applet_Sub1.java[/i] we must instead use [b]super.key == 10[/b]. Why, you may ask, do we have to add super. before key? This is because client [i]extends[/i] Applet_Sub1.java. By extending a class, the new class is like the &quot;child&quot; class, and the extended one is like the &quot;parent&quot; class. In order to use the &quot;parent&quot; (in this case, [i]Applet_Sub1.java[/i]) class&#39;s variables, we must apply [b]super.[/b] to every variable we are using from the parent, otherwise the compiler cannot differentiate from whether or not it is from the child or parent class. Now then, add [b]super.key == 10[/b] after the or operator like so:
[code=java]
if(super.anInt26 == 1 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &gt;= i1 - 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &lt;= i1 + 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &gt;= k1 - 20 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &lt;= k1 + 20 || super.key == 10)
[/code]
That&#39;s it! If you compile and run the client, you should be able to press enter to login, and click the login button to login. However, you&#39;ll notice that the enter key no longer &quot;tabs&quot; between the username and password fields, to fix this, we are going to give tab that functionality. Now then, you may remember that we added the line [b]method11(0).setFocusTraversalKeysEnabled(false);[/b] to [i]Applet_Sub1.java[/i], this is because tab is handled on its own as a focus traversal (it gives components focus), and since we don&#39;t have any components to give focus to, we must tell the Java VM that the program itself is handling tab&#39;s function. Now then, scroll down until you see this:
[code=java]
 if(anInt1216 == 0)
                    {
                        if(l1 == 8 &amp;&amp; aString1173.length() &gt; 0)
                            aString1173 = aString1173.substring(0, aString1173.length() - 1);
                        if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)
							anInt1216 = 1;
                        if(flag1)
                            aString1173 += (char)l1;
                        if(aString1173.length() &gt; 12)
                            aString1173 = aString1173.substring(0, 12);
                    } else
                    if(anInt1216 == 1)
                    {
                        if(l1 == 8 &amp;&amp; aString1174.length() &gt; 0)
                            aString1174 = aString1174.substring(0, aString1174.length() - 1);
                        if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)
                            anInt1216 = 0;
                        if(flag1)
                            aString1174 += (char)l1;
                        if(aString1174.length() &gt; 20)
                            aString1174 = aString1174.substring(0, 20);
                    }
[/code]
In order to tab between these, you must first know that [b]anInt1216[/b] (in this case, anyway), differentiates between whether you have focus on the username ([b]anInt1216 == 0[/b]) or password ([b]anInt1216 == 1[/b]) fields. Now, 
if you apply this knowledge, you should see that the focus &quot;switching&quot; is handled in this line for both if statements:
[code=java]
                        if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)
							anInt1216 = *;
[/code]
In order to give tab the focus switching function, we must first comment out the [b]if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)[/b] line (l1 is the variable that the key code is assigned to, via method5) like so:
[code=java]
                        //if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)
							anInt1216 = *;
[/code]
Now that we have done that, we can simply add in the final line. Just like last time, we must obtain &quot;permission&quot; to use the [b]key[/b] variable from [i]Applet_Sub1.java[/i] by applying [b]super.[/b] to the beginning of key ([b]super.key[/b]). Now then, to check if the user is pressing the tab key (key code [b]9[/b]), we must pass it through an if statement, like so.
[code=java]
                        //if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)
if(super.key == 9)
							anInt1216 = *;
[/code]
Do this to both lines where this occurs, and once you have finished, the entire code snippet should look like this:
[code=java]
 if(anInt1216 == 0)
                    {
                        if(l1 == 8 &amp;&amp; aString1173.length() &gt; 0)
                            aString1173 = aString1173.substring(0, aString1173.length() - 1);
                        //if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)
                        if(super.key == 9)
							anInt1216 = 1;
                        if(flag1)
                            aString1173 += (char)l1;
                        if(aString1173.length() &gt; 12)
                            aString1173 = aString1173.substring(0, 12);
                    } else
                    if(anInt1216 == 1)
                    {
                        if(l1 == 8 &amp;&amp; aString1174.length() &gt; 0)
                            aString1174 = aString1174.substring(0, aString1174.length() - 1);
                        //if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)
						if(super.key == 9)
                            anInt1216 = 0;
                        if(flag1)
                            aString1174 += (char)l1;
                        if(aString1174.length() &gt; 20)
                            aString1174 = aString1174.substring(0, 20);
                    }
[/code]
Save, exit, and compile. Congratulations, you have finished the tutorial, and if you did it correctly, you should have the ability to tab between username and password fields, and login with the enter button!

[b]Ending notes:[/b] If there is ANYTHING that is not described correctly, or if I have explained something incorrectly, PLEASE inform me of this so I can change the mistake. This is my first tutorial, and I want it to be as accurate as possible! Also note that tabbing may be incorrect, this is easily remedied in Notepad++ or any text editor of your choice!</description>

<p>Yeah, it’s that easy to modify. Lol.</p>
<p>P.S. I only posted the codes because the OP explains where to search. It’s pointless to spoonfeed if people can’t even search.</p>

I could also release a tutorial for that, but I’ll also ask for your permission. Although, I don’t really see a reason as anyone could modify it if they understood Java.</p>

<span class="bbcode-b">Notes:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">This tutorial is aimed for people who like to use the tab and enter keys for inputting information, rather than having to click the login button.<br>
This will work with ANY non-renamed (using it for renamed would be practically no work at all, but I can’t seem to find a good renamed client, PM me a download link if you so desire a renamed version).<br>
This is not a repost, but simply something I did after finding no help in this forum.</span></p>
<p>In order to actually make this work, we are going to have to find where key actions are handled in the client. This is located in <span class="bbcode-i">Applet_Sub1.java</span>. Scroll down until you find the <span class="bbcode-i">keyPressed</span> method. It should look like this:</p>
<p><code>public final void keyPressed(KeyEvent keyevent)
    {
        anInt18 = 0;
        int i = keyevent.getKeyCode();
        int j = keyevent.getKeyChar();
        if(j &lt; 30)
            j = 0;
        if(i == 37)
            j = 1;
        if(i == 39)
            j = 2;
        if(i == 38)
            j = 3;
        if(i == 40)
            j = 4;
        if(i == 17)
            j = 5;
        if(i == 8)
            j = 8;
        if(i == 127)
            j = 8;
        if(i == 9)
            j = 9;
        if(i == 10)
            j = 10;
        if(i &gt;= 112 &amp;&amp; i &lt;= 123)
            j = (1008 + i) - 112;
        if(i == 36)
            j = 1000;
        if(i == 35)
            j = 1001;
        if(i == 33)
            j = 1002;
        if(i == 34)
            j = 1003;
        if(j &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; j &lt; 128)
            anIntArray30[j] = 1;
        if(j &gt; 4)
        {
	anIntArray31[anInt33] = j;
            anInt33 = anInt33 + 1 &amp; 0x7f;
        }
    }
</code><br>
Now then, this works by obtaining the code of the key pressed on the keyboard, and then assigning variable <span class="bbcode-b">j</span> the code itself. For future reference, we are going to be using the key codes <span class="bbcode-b">9</span> for the <span class="bbcode-i">tab</span> key and <span class="bbcode-b">10</span> for the <span class="bbcode-i">enter</span> key. If you so desire, you can replace the lines below:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        if(i == 9)
            j = 9;
        if(i == 10)
            j = 10;</code></pre>
<p>with:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        if(i == KeyEvent.VK_TAB)
            j = 9;
        if(i == KeyEvent.VK_ENTER)
            j = 10;</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">NOTE:</span> This is <span class="bbcode-b">optional</span>, and does not impact the tutorial in anyway. It is just for easier reference in the future.</p>
<p>Since we want a simple way to obtain the key code, without interfering with <span class="bbcode-b">anIntArray31</span>, we are going to create a new public variable. Scroll to the bottom until you see where all of the variables are declared. At the very bottom of this list, before the <span class="bbcode-b">}</span>, add:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int key;</code></pre>
<p>This is the variable we will be using to check whether the user has pressed the enter or tab keys. (Quick note: You can use this to basically check for any key press in any class that either extends or imports Applet_Sub1.java)<br>
Scroll back up to the <span class="bbcode-i">keyPressed</span> method, and find this portion of the code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        if(j &gt; 4)
        {
	anIntArray31[anInt33] = j;
            anInt33 = anInt33 + 1 &amp; 0x7f;
        }</code></pre>
<p>This is where we will be assigning the variable <span class="bbcode-b">key</span> its value. Now then, this portion of <span class="bbcode-i">keyPressed</span> assigns the array <span class="bbcode-b">anIntArray31</span> the key’s code that was pressed. The array, and its key are both private and handled by <span class="bbcode-i">method5</span> (I may update the tutorial to use this method, but I wanted to keep this as simple and easy to understand as possible). Now then, in the same fashion that <span class="bbcode-b">anIntArray31</span> obtains its value, we are going to assign <span class="bbcode-b">key</span> its value like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        if(j &gt; 4)
        {
key = j;	
anIntArray31[anInt33] = j;
            anInt33 = anInt33 + 1 &amp; 0x7f;
        }</code></pre>
<p>There is one more line we must add to the code. Scroll up to the <span class="bbcode-i">run</span> method, and find these lines:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">        method11(0).addMouseListener(this);
        method11(0).addMouseMotionListener(this);
        method11(0).addKeyListener(this);
        method11(0).addFocusListener(this);</code></pre>
<p>After <span class="bbcode-b">method11(0).addFocusListener(this);</span> add this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">method11(0).setFocusTraversalKeysEnabled(false);</code></pre>
<p>I will explain its function later on, when we add tabbing.<br>
Congratulations, if you followed my instructions, we are now done editing <span class="bbcode-i">Applet_Sub1.java</span>. You can save and exit and open up <span class="bbcode-i">client.java</span> now.<br>
Now we are going to give the enter key its functionality, search for this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">super.anInt26 == 1 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &gt;= i1 - 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &lt;= i1 + 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &gt;= k1 - 20 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &lt;= k1 + 20</code></pre>
<p>If you searched correctly, you should see this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">                if(super.anInt26 == 1 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &gt;= i1 - 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &lt;= i1 + 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &gt;= k1 - 20 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &lt;= k1 + 20)
                {
                    anInt1038 = 0;
					method84(aString1173, aString1174, false);
                    if(aBoolean1157)
                        return;
                }</code></pre>
<p>Now then, this if statement simply finds whether you have clicked within the bounds of the login button, and if you did, it begins the login process. In order to just press enter instead of clicking the button, we must find whether or not the user has pressed the enter button. Remember that I had said that the enter key’s code is <span class="bbcode-b">10</span>? We are going to use that by asking whether <span class="bbcode-b">key</span> (The variable we declared in <span class="bbcode-i">Applet_Sub1.java</span>) is equal to 10. In order to do this, we must make sure that the user can both either press the button <span class="bbcode-i">or</span> press the enter key to login. This is done by using the [b]||<a>/b</a> operator. We are going to add this operator right after <span class="bbcode-b">super.anInt28 &lt;= k1 + 20</span> like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">                if(super.anInt26 == 1 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &gt;= i1 - 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &lt;= i1 + 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &gt;= k1 - 20 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &lt;= k1 + 20 || )</code></pre>
<p>However, this is obviously not the only thing we have to do, keeping the if statement that way will generate an “Illegal start of expression” error. Now then, after the || operator, we are going to check whether <span class="bbcode-b">key</span> equals 10.<br>
Unfortunately, <span class="bbcode-b">key</span> is not declared in <span class="bbcode-i">client.java</span>, so just using key == 10 will generate an error as you compile. In order to “grab” the key variable from <span class="bbcode-i">Applet_Sub1.java</span> we must instead use <span class="bbcode-b">super.key == 10</span>. Why, you may ask, do we have to add super. before key? This is because client <span class="bbcode-i">extends</span> Applet_Sub1.java. By extending a class, the new class is like the “child” class, and the extended one is like the “parent” class. In order to use the “parent” (in this case, <span class="bbcode-i">Applet_Sub1.java</span>) class’s variables, we must apply <span class="bbcode-b">super.</span> to every variable we are using from the parent, otherwise the compiler cannot differentiate from whether or not it is from the child or parent class. Now then, add <span class="bbcode-b">super.key == 10</span> after the or operator like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(super.anInt26 == 1 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &gt;= i1 - 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt27 &lt;= i1 + 75 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &gt;= k1 - 20 &amp;&amp; super.anInt28 &lt;= k1 + 20 || super.key == 10)</code></pre>
<p>That’s it! If you compile and run the client, you should be able to press enter to login, and click the login button to login. However, you’ll notice that the enter key no longer “tabs” between the username and password fields, to fix this, we are going to give tab that functionality. Now then, you may remember that we added the line <span class="bbcode-b">method11(0).setFocusTraversalKeysEnabled(false);</span> to <span class="bbcode-i">Applet_Sub1.java</span>, this is because tab is handled on its own as a focus traversal (it gives components focus), and since we don’t have any components to give focus to, we must tell the Java VM that the program itself is handling tab’s function. Now then, scroll down until you see this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> if(anInt1216 == 0)
                    {
                        if(l1 == 8 &amp;&amp; aString1173.length() &gt; 0)
                            aString1173 = aString1173.substring(0, aString1173.length() - 1);
                        if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)
							anInt1216 = 1;
                        if(flag1)
                            aString1173 += (char)l1;
                        if(aString1173.length() &gt; 12)
                            aString1173 = aString1173.substring(0, 12);
                    } else
                    if(anInt1216 == 1)
                    {
                        if(l1 == 8 &amp;&amp; aString1174.length() &gt; 0)
                            aString1174 = aString1174.substring(0, aString1174.length() - 1);
                        if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)
                            anInt1216 = 0;
                        if(flag1)
                            aString1174 += (char)l1;
                        if(aString1174.length() &gt; 20)
                            aString1174 = aString1174.substring(0, 20);
                    }</code></pre>
<p>In order to tab between these, you must first know that <span class="bbcode-b">anInt1216</span> (in this case, anyway), differentiates between whether you have focus on the username (<span class="bbcode-b">anInt1216 == 0</span>) or password (<span class="bbcode-b">anInt1216 == 1</span>) fields. Now,<br>
if you apply this knowledge, you should see that the focus “switching” is handled in this line for both if statements:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">                        if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)
							anInt1216 = *;</code></pre>
<p>In order to give tab the focus switching function, we must first comment out the <span class="bbcode-b">if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)</span> line (l1 is the variable that the key code is assigned to, via method5) like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">                        //if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)
							anInt1216 = *;</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have done that, we can simply add in the final line. Just like last time, we must obtain “permission” to use the <span class="bbcode-b">key</span> variable from <span class="bbcode-i">Applet_Sub1.java</span> by applying <span class="bbcode-b">super.</span> to the beginning of key (<span class="bbcode-b">super.key</span>). Now then, to check if the user is pressing the tab key (key code <span class="bbcode-b">9</span>), we must pass it through an if statement, like so.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">                        //if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)
if(super.key == 9)
							anInt1216 = *;</code></pre>
<p>Do this to both lines where this occurs, and once you have finished, the entire code snippet should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> if(anInt1216 == 0)
                    {
                        if(l1 == 8 &amp;&amp; aString1173.length() &gt; 0)
                            aString1173 = aString1173.substring(0, aString1173.length() - 1);
                        //if(l1 == 9 || l1 == 10 || l1 == 13)
                        if(super.key == 9)

                        if(flag1)
                            aString1173 += (char)l1;
                        if(aString1173.length() &gt; 12)

                    } else
                    if(anInt1216 == 1)

This is my first tutorial, and I want it to be as accurate as possible! Also note that tabbing may be incorrect, this is easily remedied in Notepad++ or any text editor of your choice!</p>
