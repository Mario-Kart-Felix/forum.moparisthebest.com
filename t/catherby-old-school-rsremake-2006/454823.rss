    <description>[center]OK everyone, there is a reason i made a new thread. Other one was dying. And i wanted to rename it. But never less lets get to this! Catherby was coded by Mini Slurpee. So credits go to him. Me and him teamed up about 3 weeks ago. So a lot of time has been spent into this server. Home is at catherby. You actually work for your items. Mine for ores, then smith it for Armour. Fish and cook for your food! Slayer for better items. Runes to teleport much more! Lets get onto the rest of the server.
