    <title>Aggroth v4 - Cache error? - anyone else getting this lately?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/aggroth-v4-cache-error-anyone-else-getting-this-lately/546089</link>
    <description>hello, I was trying to get this server going but ran into somekind of error. Please help if you can thank you.

1) I&#39;ve downloaded Aggroth v4
2) Would download cache but not fully.
3) So i manually download the cache from it&#39;s link, and manually extract it to my C:/ drive 

Works if you play! But i want to make it available so other people can play if i was to jar it. Which isn&#39;t possible if it wouldn&#39;t be able to download the cache!

4) Reupload the cache to dropbox
5) Changed the old cachedownloader.java link to the new one, changed a link in client.java that linked up to a different server cache
6) Compile!
7) Run

8) Received error
