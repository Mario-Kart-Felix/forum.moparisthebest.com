    <description>Well not sure if I should post this here or what, but since the server help section is full of questions a monkey could answer I think this may be your best help question yet.

Anyways, Im from classic section and going to be messing around with rs2 for a bit. So I got some questions.

1)There any servers with mysql? If so are they released or private. If you know of a released one give me a link.

2)Where exactly is rs2 development currently at? (I mean like, before when this all started the main thing was to get your client to &quot;login&quot;. So where are you at now? Trying to get your source more stability or what?)

3)What tools are publicly available? Example: Interface maker. Is there a map editor or anything?

4)Why are objects/npcs/items in text files?</description>

<p>Yes. I personally can’t give you specific link however.</p>

<p>The only thing left is bug fixes. A stable and scalable source would be hyperion.</p>

<p>None that I’m aware of.</p>

<p>I’m sure there are some servers that use xml (which is what should be used for configurations).</p>
