    <title>Eternal Lands Bot</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eternal-lands-bot/165672</link>
    <description>Let me start of by saying, yes I know eternal lands sucks hardcore. I was just looking for something easy to fuck with to kill some time.

Anyway, this is pretty complete script-able bot for the game Eternal Lands ([url=http://www.eternal-lands.com/]http://www.eternal-lands.com/[/url]) . It may (and probably is) be quite buggy, as it was coded in a matter of hours.

Script language is essentially javascript, script setup is a threaded run(); return ms to next run(); setup. I haven&#39;t yet taken the time to write any form of reference down, but if you look at the included scripts (warning: they are very messy) you should get at least a rough idea of the setup.

Also, be warned - the EL staff does not take kindly to undeclared bots - and to declare a bot you must pay them. I had many an IP banned while creating this, but from what I found out the only thing that got me banned was autoing too long (24 hours a day == bad;).

I don&#39;t know if anyone is really interested in this, but if there is enough people maybe I&#39;ll finish up what isn&#39;t yet done.

Also be warned: this was coded in Visual Basic 6 (out of sheer laziness), so if it says your missing a file - just google it and place either in the same directory as the ELAuto.exe or in C:\windows\system32\ (assuming c is your windows drive)</description>
