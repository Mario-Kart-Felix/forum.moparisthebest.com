    <title>Packet validation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/packet-validation/519356</link>
    <description>with a majority of all rsps servers being solely run for profits, it&#39;s hard to suit the wants and needs for your playerbase. as many people run their servers, they want the players to be happy, but they don&#39;t want the economy to be crashed. as some are too incompetent to redo packet validation because of they either don&#39;t know how or feel as though the server is in &#39;hosting condition&#39; this causes many of them to be turned into spawn servers.

now not everyone loves spawn servers. i myself, would rather play an economy server for two reasons. i like to actually be able to show off my wealth, and it gives me the ability to fu[b][/b]ck up the economy.

i&#39;ve tried many times in the past to get people not to use project insanity, but my voice was never heard. even if it was, it wouldn&#39;t stop anything because the packets are checked properly on the majority of &#39;base&#39; servers.


two things that [b]aren&#39;t[/b] checked in packet processing are appearance and objects.

appearance: is the appearance a valid appearance (allows for users to go completely invisible/custom appearances)
objects: use any object from anywhere (prayer in wild (also heals you on most servers), banking, and majority of skills, portals for teleporting etc.)
region object loading: spawn objects on the game per region, not globally (reloading the region will erase the object though)


some resource skills can be used to spawn items anywhere (woodcutting, mining)
skills can be used anywhere + with autotypers/clickers (runecrafting, fishing, thieving)
objects can be abused in pvp (prayer healing, quick teleports, prayer switching, magic switching, etc)
          though these can be checked and validated, switching interfaces can still be done client sided. so you will need to do some
          checks upon activating prayers/spells and checking which book is currently being used.
appearance can be glitched to show you as another player (chat packet even shows their name), or custom appearances (invisible,
          minecarts, objects, npcs, etc.)



as well with the majority of packets not being properly validated, the content is horribly written. the combat contains dupes, the skills contain dupes, the minigames contain dupes, and the server is a memory-eater.

all-in-all, if you are only in the scene to make money, don&#39;t expect to be punishing abusers (i do love to go on random servers and do this. i have a custom client, but i can also just download yours and readd my commands)


so yeah. if you&#39;re gonna host a server, either take the time to properly check things, or don&#39;t complain when players do it. when someone finds a bug/dupe/glitch, it gets leaked extremely fast</description>
