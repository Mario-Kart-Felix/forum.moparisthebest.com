    <title>Shutting down forums</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shutting-down-forums/557046</link>
    <description>There hasn&#39;t been any activity to speak of here in a few years now, I&#39;m considering archiving the forums as static HTML and shutting down discourse.

It&#39;s been a great run and we still have a very active community on IRC at [irc.moparisthebest.com](ircs://irc.moparisthebest.com:6697/mopar) TLS port 6697 #mopar, please join! ([webchat](https://www.moparisthebest.com/kiwi/))

If you want to say anything or leave any contact details feel free, I&#39;ll also put the link here to the GitHub repo the static site will live in so if you come by after it&#39;s converted you can still comment via pull request.

Thanks for everything and remember, hold on to your butts!</description>
