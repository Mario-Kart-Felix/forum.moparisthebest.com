    <title>[PI]Npc not showing a yellow dop on map</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-npc-not-showing-a-yellow-dop-on-map/384056</link>
    <description>Hello,

I wanna know how I make npc&#39;s a yellow dot in map.
Current some npc&#39;s in my game don&#39;t got them. So that&#39;s kind of annoying.
Not sure if it&#39;s client/server sided.


The npc that has this is the &#39;rat&#39; and some more. Not sure if it supposed to be like this but I really want to it have to a yellow dot I know where the npc&#39;s are. (also the little ones)</description>
