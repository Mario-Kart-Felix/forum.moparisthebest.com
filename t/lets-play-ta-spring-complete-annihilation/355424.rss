No doubt the deepest rts i&#39;ve ever played, and the battles are incredibly entertaining.

Basically the Spring engine is designed with a &quot;widget&quot;-system in mind and focus on unit macroing on a grand scale. The average 1vs1 battle takes about 10 minutes max, and the huge variety in unit types and maps makes it incredibly challenging. Not to mention it is open-source and constantly improved, the graphics are some of the best in an open-source game ever too.

The &quot;game&quot; Complete Annihilation has terraforming. For instance, building a hill for a turret can be a massive advantage  for various reasons, one of them includes the fact that units cannot shoot through things like in most rts&#39;s. Actual physics apply to all projectiles, so building 10 turrets in a row would make you very vulnerable if attacked from the side.

Oh and plenty of people play online, there&#39;s around 100 people average in the lobby and about 1-2k during peak hours.
