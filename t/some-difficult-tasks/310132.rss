   hey, i was wondering if it was possible to add another staff rank, i mean i know there&#39;s player=0 mod=1 admin=2
but i wanted to make a few more, idk for exmaple for a &quot;donater&quot; rank, or a &quot;veteran rank&quot; or a &quot;skiller rank&quot;
    or wtever, and for example if it was possible then to make a person with all the skills lvl maxed out then how can i make it so they can tele to a new area?

would anyon know ow to do any of this? like make a new rank but with the player=0  so that the person doesnt have any benefuts, i only want it so the person has a custom crown.</description>

I guess your using a 508+ cause you didn’t mention playerrights 3 and post exactly the rank you want so we can help u easier <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
