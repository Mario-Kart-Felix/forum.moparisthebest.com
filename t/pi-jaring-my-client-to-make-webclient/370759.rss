&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Sorry, an error has occurred whilst loading cursedpkz.
To fix this try the following(in order)
1.Close all browser windows and reloading
2.Try clearing cache
3.Try using different game world
4.Try rebooting your computer
5.Try selecting a different version of Java from the play game menu&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
