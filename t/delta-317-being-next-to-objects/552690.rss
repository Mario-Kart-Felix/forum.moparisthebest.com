    <title>Delta 317 - Being next to objects?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-317-being-next-to-objects/552690</link>
    <description>Looking for a bit of help, I know a lot of people have done this before.

Server is a delta based 317.  I&#39;m looking to add the functionality of being next to doors, NPCs, objects, etc. before they &#39;activate&#39; and perform their various tasks.  I was wondering if this is server sided or client sided and where I should look to add in my code.  I&#39;m not really looking for a copy+paste solution, but more of an understanding of how this system works.

It should be noted that I don&#39;t have much experience with Java, but I&#39;m pretty well versed in c# and I know they are quite similar</description>
