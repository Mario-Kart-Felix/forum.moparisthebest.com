    <title>Converting 562 loading 602 to load 657</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/converting-562-loading-602-to-load-657/422656</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m working on converting my 562 loading 602 server to a 562 loading 657.

 I have put the equipment and the mapdata in and everything looks good, 

[s]but when I try to use the item command for say... 20135-Torva full helm. I get malformed command error.[/s] 
[s]
Now, I know that in order to get the equip.txt to work I had to edit the array to allow more items. I&#39;m wondering is there a function that controls the amount of items or max item number for commands? Also am I missing something to make the new items work?[/s]

[s]I have fixed the malformed error by editing the array in the itemdefinitions.java, now I still get toolkits. What more do I need to add to the server to get the new items to work correctly?[/s]

Adding the items in the itemdefinitions.xml fixed the issue. Now the final thing, the flashing HP icon. Should be a simple fix. Where I go my client it basically says add sendConfig(5000,hitpoints) packet. Literally that. Do I add this to the action sender somewhere or the action button packet sender or what. He did a terrible job of explaining this.</description>
