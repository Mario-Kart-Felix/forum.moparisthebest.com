    <description>I am going to throw something out my window cause this is like impossible and makes no sense

One day, a person went to a race track. Instead of counting the number of human and cars, he instead counted 74 heads and 196 tires. Yet he knew the number of humans and horses there. How did he do it, and how many humans and cars are there? 


My teacher gave us this for extra credit for 80 points lol and I have asked so many people. Any idea? SOMETHING? or do i need a scientist</description>

These are all typical numbers, and do not include spares.<br>
Trailers vary…<br>
They have 3 wheel, 5 wheel, and more.<br>
It depends on the size of the hull. (How many horses you’re expecting to carry etc).<br>
Each trailer would have a spare.<br>
That is a lot of variables you need to look into before you can even begin to do the math about the heads…</p>

<p>tires = 196<br>

<p>(There is as many heads as tires for a horse driver pair, so I find how many cars it needs to be on the track to fulfil that requirement)<br>
heads - x = tires - 4x<br>
3x = tires - (heads - 1)<br>
3x = 196 - 73<br>
x = 41</p>
<p>41 four-wheeled cars with a driver.</p>
<p>You have then left<br>
32 tires and 32 heads.</p>
<p>16 (2 * tires + 2 * heads) = 16 horses with rider in a cart.<br>
People = 74 - 16 = 58</p>
<p>So there is 41 cars and 58 people (Including yourself).</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Mikeyzzz, the question states that the person counted the heads, and asks how many people and horses there are, therefore the number of heads given includes horse heads.</p>
<p>The question provides the following information: the amount of wheels and the amount of heads, assuming that a typical car has 4 wheels and that since the number of wheels is divisible by 4, then presumably there are 49 cars. You also have to assume that for every car there is at least 1 person as a driver, so there are at least 49 drivers, that gives a headcount of 25 left.</p>
<p>Deciding what to classify the remaining 25 heads as is a little tricky. The question is extremely vague and you really don’t know what the question is trying to test. You can leave it as simply, there are 49 cars, at least 49 people, and presumably 25 horses. The question however could be testing to see how well you think outside the box, or how well you think inside the box. How many horses are typically raced at a race track? If the local horse racing only accepts 8 starters, you could explain that you think there are 66 people and 8 horses. The question may trick you into thinking that the car has to be a 4 wheel car, there could be any number of 3 wheel cars so long as they add up to multiples of 4, which would reduce the amount of cars for example. How you answer the question depends on how you interpret what it is trying to test for.</p>

              <p>So there are both horses and cars at the race track? Given the information we can assume there are 49 cars, are the cars in the race and is there only 1 human to a car? 1 human to a horse and we aren’t counting people not in the race? That leaves 25 heads of humans/horses(if they are included) after the cars. Honestly though this seems like a ‘think outside the box’ problem, because imo there is a lack of information on the specifics here.</p>

              <p>-make sure to count some of those heads as being the trainers/riders.<br>
-it didn’t say what type of tire so you have to count the hourse being transferred to the track as some of the tires ( normally the horse trailers I have seen have 2-3 tires by itself?)</p>

<p>One day, a person went to a race track. Instead of counting the number of human and cars, he instead counted 74 heads and 196 tires. Yet he knew the number of humans and horses there. How did he do it, and how many humans and cars are there?</p>
<p>My teacher gave us this for extra credit for 80 points lol and I have asked so many people. Any idea? SOMETHING? or do i need a scientist</p>
