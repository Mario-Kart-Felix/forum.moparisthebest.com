<p>I don’t understand how you could be so be foolish. There is no way that rational logic is backing a decision to make exp rates 13-35. With those rates, it will give the “don’t enter the wilderness until I have dream stats” but it will still take at least a week to get flats, or make a hybrid for instance. If you didn’t catch the hint, everyone in the wilderness will be the same stats, having the same boring fights at castle we’ve all been having for 5+ years now. Except as opposed to a real PK server like stork, you just took a fucking week and a half to get your stats. And don’t you dare think that a server with those rates will have any sort of economy or gameplay besides PKing and staking.[/quote]</p>

        <p>Everything we pretty much enjoy or enjoyed about RSC has pretty much been replicated, If RSC was still around now and being monitored and updated, Im sure there would of been several new features and updates we would of liked to of seen added, So i think its always good to yes keep RSC replicated on how we last remembered it &amp; Played it, But theres no harm in new features which will carry on making it interesting.</p>
<p>Theres only so long us old players will carry on playing for, The idea now to keep the community &amp; Game alive is to keep adding new and original features, That will attract and interest new players. We have to rely on new players to keep the community growth high. This  will obviously incourage old players to keep on playing as there will be a bigger player community. Theres no point in just concentrating on what old players want because that hasnt worked in the past as more and more quit due to lack of players.</p>
<p>If a server has more active players, And the Wilderness is constantly active. This encourages them to play. No one wants to be sat at the castle for hours on end waiting for 1 or 2 people to login.</p>
<p>PS: I’ve always said that RSCE needs a complete DB wipe, And the Rates lowered, I know a large percentage of the community disagrees with this, Because were all mature adults now, And we dont have time to train with such low XP Rates &amp; Lack of time, But the reason why RSC was so enjoyable was there was always somthing to aim for, We were always aiming for those higher stats, And it was a struggle, And when we got a R2H Kill in the Wild, Or Full Set, It was exciting, Because 2H’s were Valuable, Sets were Valuable, I remember days when R2H were 750k-1M and when they hadnt introduced fast trade, So it was pretty much impossible to trade over 500-700k without logging out, You had to every so often hit the Space &amp; Ent key to remain logged in a little longer.</p>
<p>The way to keep a server exciting &amp; enjoyable is Slow XP &amp; Good economy, Were only a handfull of people will reach smithing in the 90’s And most people will only likely have sets of Addy &amp; Maybe a Rune Long at best.</p>
<p>I remember playing Demonik and that was pretty much like that for a fair while untill it shutdown, Getting a full Addy kill was great.</p>

<p>cbf responding to half the shit that you said because im no longer a teenager and don’t have time for such things, BUT</p>
<p>if it’s a PK server, that would make it an anti-grinding server right? Good luck getting 99 pray or ranged on a 15x or even 35x exp server without botting, buying mass dragon bone certs (which would mean someone else grinded them), or zezima’ing.</p>
<p>high exp rates (excluding PK servers with 100x+ exp rates, that shits fun to pk on) may be fun at first but they ruin the game, if you can’t see this I don’t know how to help you.</p>
