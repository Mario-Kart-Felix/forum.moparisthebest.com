    <title>What does Bot Nuke Day mean for RuneScape client hacking?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-does-bot-nuke-day-mean-for-runescape-client-hacking/419521</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t visited the runescape cheating scene in a long time, but this update caught my attention.

As far as i know from researching, the obfuscation of the client has been increased so writing a new updater would take ages.

Also, client loading was always a concern, but now every time the game loads a unique applet is loaded as well, which i don&#39;t want to even bother looking into.

And I heard a rumor that IDs in the game might be dynamic now, adding yet more time to find a way around that, but I haven&#39;t looked into it.

Anyone know anything else towards what this update did to prevent &quot;reflection&quot;?  I expected them to actually &quot;Stop&quot; botting, not just &quot;Make it harder&quot;.  From what I see this is just a road-bump.

EDIT: And if they rewrote the way objects are stored in memory by removing instance variables and storing everything in a scrambled multidimensional array, that&#39;ll be fun to decode and figure out how/where everything is stored...</description>

<p>Yes however, Jacmob rewrote RSBot (RSBot2) and then because of the aforementioned netadmin, Jacmob decided to create a new site &amp; bot (the bot is currently based off RSBot2 but with many major changes and improvements, also is being completely rewritten) called RSBuddy where he pretty much manages everything.</p>
