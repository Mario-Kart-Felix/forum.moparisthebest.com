    <title>Anyone have a nVidia developer center account?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-have-a-nvidia-developer-center-account/441708</link>
    <description>I really need the physx plugin (2.6) for 3ds max 2011 64 bit, I found 2.7, but it doesn&#39;t work with my version of the rayfire plugin, 1.56.


I&#39;ve tried signing up for an account, but each account has to be verified by their team, and you have to say why you need an account etc.  Think they declined mine that&#39;s all.


STH, Archer, Frell?


Cheeeeeeeers.
