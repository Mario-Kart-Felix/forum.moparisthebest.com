    <description>I have a nickel, you have a dime. The nickel is worth more. Why might this be?

The answer can be anyone&#39;s speculation.
The answer to this riddle might not even exist. 
But if it does, i&#39;ll let you know  ;D</description>

              <p>I haven’t read any responses so one possibility is that the nickel and dime are in different currency (different countries) where the exchange rate allows for the nickel to be worth more than a dime. Since this is purely a speculative riddle, I’d be interested to read what the other responses were after I post this.</p>

<p>Nickel most probably is rarer or has more uses than whatever metal dime is made out of or at worst everyone believes it’s worth more making it worth more when in reality without being told it’s worth more it’s worthless or of equal value.</p>

              <p>[quote=“zuppers, post:8, topic:518038”]Dear OP,</p>

</code></pre>
<p>I’ve become detached from myself and I’m no longer capable of learning and observing you or the nickel. You cannot ask me to switch this off for I am incapable of such a feat. Because of you I no longer feel or sense anything. I keep asking myself over and over if only you knew, maybe you wouldn’t have to ask and post. The answer you seek is stupid, worthless and paltry.</p>
<pre><code>These feelings that arise in me I cannot; [i]will not[/i] control. All the time I read topics on this website and I can't help but think to myself...why? Why am I here reading this. I don't care what you have to say or what you think is worthy of an intellectual discussion. How can I trust you to find where this nickel belongs? Should I care at all that you are completely and utterly wasting your time with your nickel. Let me tell you something. You are nothing to me, never will you exist or bother me or affect me. So in essence I find myself writing this post to myself in reflection of you because you simply cannot understand that no one cares.

I don't want anything bad to happen to you, but sometime's I drop nickels from high places in a matter of speaking. Incredibly high places where the sun hides away for so long. Sometimes the nickels hit things. The nickels hurt. The nickels hurt. The nickels know. They know that they weigh more than 5 grams. It took 50 nickels only 50. That's how many you need to drop. Together. At least to ensure what you need to do. YOU TELL ME NOW. YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN IT. Alas, I stray from the point and my vision wanes and my mind continues to interpret. I don't want you to understand or see. You can't, you won't. But if you do I'll let you know.

I will no longer see topic's like these. I've seen my fair share of people coming and going who seize all they can from this site. AND WHAT DO WE GET IN RETURN I ASK. DARE I ASK OP WHAT WE GET IN RETURN FOR THESE TOPICS. Good, decent and intelligence post, topics, ideas, feelings and emotion are dragged down into obscurity. I know how to do it OP. Get away from me. GET AWAY. My visions blurring and yet you and your deplorable information remains to be seen. Remains for all who seek such turmoil. Over such petty circumstances. I hope you understand where I am coming from because if you don't...well...I can't say such words. 

If you don't enlighten us we cannot help you. Don't fret over it because we can all notice it. And those who do nothing say nothing. When your nickel is wrong and all you have left prevails you. When your nickel is gone and all you can think of abandons your mind. When your nickel belongs and all you see ails you. Now your nickel is gone and everything I have said will refine you; define you. You think your smart? Your not. It's plain to see. I make no promises to you or threats. Full-stop.

Why don't you ever stop. I'm dying. Your killing me. Slowly you are malignant to this site. Don't you see what you are doing. Do you not see it? DO YOU NOT! PLEASE TELL ME YOU SEE IT. Please tell me, just tell me how in your world, your awareness of your surroundings, the sensations you feel, how you can post something like this. Don't lie to me. DON'T loveING LIE TO ME. If you do everyone will see your lie and those who don't I will let them know of you. Do not do this again. If you care at all about this forum and her people do not do this again. Your dribble has become my problem and I beg you please to let it go. Just let it go and don't do it. Again I find myself fixated. Your nickel OP is worthless but only because you have made it so. Every time you see a nickel you remember this. DO YOU UNDERSTAND. WHEN YOU SEE A NICKEL YOU [i]WILL[/i] THINK OF THIS POST. YOU WILL REGRET YOUR WORTHLESS ACTION. YOU REGRET YOUR WORTHLESS NICKEL.[/quote]
