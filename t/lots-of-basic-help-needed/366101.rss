    <description>Hello Im pretty new to private servers (as are a lot of people i see) but im a quick learner but i have a lot of questions on my mind so if you would take the time and don&#39;t laugh at that rhyme to answer a few questions of mine, that would be great.
Q1 If you want to make a respectable server is it ok to download a source then just change it a bit?
Q2 I have not tried yet but when i Portfoward is there a way to tell if i have done it correctly?
Q3 Im on windows 7 but i see most tuts on Xp do servers not work as well on 7? 
Q4 What is a anit leech? no anti leech?
Q5 For starting out should i go with a blank source or start from nothing? (i don&#39;t know how to though)
Q6 I like 317&#39;s but seems like everyone is going to 508&#39;s+ should i learn how to code both?
Q7 is delta 317? What is delta?
Q8 when people refer to 474 items are they talking about like godswords?
Q9 Any tips for me? forums i should read?..good source to start on?
Well thanks a ton if you can answer these i know its a pain take care

              <p>A1 Just give credits to whoever made the source and client.<br>
A2 Once you have port-forwarded and have your no-ip and server running, go to <a href="http://runelocus.com" rel="nofollow noopener">runelocus.com</a> and click on the status checker, then enter your server no-ip.<br>
A3 For a better client run on windows 7, use my tutorial <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWLhIkL4sTc" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a><br>
A4 Anti leech is to help protect against leechers (prevent leeching).<br>
A5 I would start out with a source and client that has been made but doesn’t have much stuff on it, just enough to run then build your way up.<br>
A6 I would learn how to code 317’s because they are the easiest, then work your way to a higher degree.<br>
A7 Yes, Delta is a 317 source. Delta is one of the easiest sources to work with (great for beginners).<br>
A8<br>
A9 You should look at some tutorials that people have posted because some can help you in major ways, and others might just be simple mistakes that you have made or forgot to correct. You might want to start on a 317 delta. Hope this helps =P</p>
