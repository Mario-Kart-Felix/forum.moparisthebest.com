              <p>I read this thread for like 10 minutes and all I read about was RSCE. Then I tried to go download the RSCE client, had to get it from a third party, because the download link wasn’t working properly. Took about 15 minutes to download/extract the client. Then I tried to run it and remembered I didn’t have java downloaded. So about 30 minutes later I’m still looking at this thread, disappointed.</p>

<p>Instead of wasting time with a database we should just have a directory to store each logged action as a text file. That way it’s easy to allow people access to that.</p>

<p>That’s outright retarded.</p>

</aside>
<p>Please do explain your self. My good friend Yong Min said the easier it is for database storing, the easier the server is to maintain. Therefor, more useful updates. Text file saving is just such a relief… I mean who needs data base storing into phpmyadmin, such extra work that is just pointless…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You obviously have no concept of what a database is or does.</p>
<p>If things were stored as text files, there would be no (good) way to analyze, process, or show the data at all.  Also it would take up more space than if put into a database, and none of the pre-written tools for backup, analytics, sorting, viewing etc etc would work.  It would also make it somewhat platform dependent, and just be a horrible idea all together.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well my good friend and well respected coder Yong Min said text file based saving is the best way for data bases. So I will believe his word over anyone on this site. And you obviously have no concept or what a database does because you think text files are horrible. You really need to do some research because they are more handy then you would ever imagine. You don’t have to load up anything, just open a folder and all of the characters are there, sorted alphabetically. The files are much smaller than a mysql database. It’s the easiest to maintain, easiest to run. And if you want to remove a player from your server, all you gotta do is right click and delete! bam all there stuff is gone!<br>

<p>You obviously have no concept of what a database is or does.</p>
<p>If things were stored as text files, there would be no (good) way to analyze, process, or show the data at all.  Also it would take up more space than if put into a database, and none of the pre-written tools for backup, analytics, sorting, viewing etc etc would work.  It would also make it somewhat platform dependent, and just be a horrible idea all together.</p>

<p>You’re an idiot and if your good friend really told you that then he must be an idiot too. Relational databases exist and flat text files are not used for a reason. If you start using flat text files and put everything to do with a player in a single text file then at some point you start multiplying data. Not to mention that to handle these text files as a database you’d have to write your own custom parsers.</p>

<p>Well I don’t care what YOU think. The most respected coder Yong Min and xEnt have both created top of the line servers using text base data storing. Those server were 2 of the most successful servers in RSC private server history. Facts don’t lie little guy. Say your website gets hacked, all of your players are in-danger, everything is gone… This can’t happen with text file saving, because they actually have to hack either you, or your dedicated server which is highly unlikely because you’re already the smarter person using text base over sql base. Only a PURE retard would use sql over text base. There’s so many benefits that out weight sql and there is MAYBE 1 benefit of sql and I don’t even know if there is that…<br>
Also, take a look at source codes for people who have used txt based server to sql. Yong Min has single-handedly changed the atmosphere of this forum because of his genius’ ways and his code. His code is so fucking clean you couldn’t even wipe your ass with it. Also, xEnt is probably the best quitter in RSC history but it doesn’t take away what he has done with Beyond RSC, probably the 2nd best source code(behind noob scape of course) in history. None of you have facts, and I do.<br>
[/quote]I severely hope you’re trolling… lol[/quote]<br>
Finally! 10 posts later and someone finally sees the trolling. I mean cmon, Yong Min in any debate automatically means it’s a fucking joke. I said literally the same thing like 3x in a row ;\ <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Either way, ‘5 1’ is either an idiot or is trolling, I can’t really tell which.  Regardless, if you are performing database-like actions, then you should be using a database.  If you don’t want to run a database server like MySQL, then you can use something like SQLite, the server MoparRSC runs will likely support either of those options.</p>

<p>I don’t think MoparRSC would be setup so anyone could hack the database though. Even if someone managed to, I’m sure they would make a backup of the database regularly. Saving everything as text documents just sounds unnecessarily tedious, and probably not that efficient.</p>

<p>You obviously have no concept of what a database is or does.</p>
<p>If things were stored as text files, there would be no (good) way to analyze, process, or show the data at all.  Also it would take up more space than if put into a database, and none of the pre-written tools for backup, analytics, sorting, viewing etc etc would work.  It would also make it somewhat platform dependent, and just be a horrible idea all together.<br>

Well my good friend and well respected coder Yong Min said text file based saving is the best way for data bases. So I will believe his word over anyone on this site. And you obviously have no concept or what a database does because you think text files are horrible. You really need to do some research because they are more handy then you would ever imagine. You don’t have to load up anything, just open a folder and all of the characters are there, sorted alphabetically. The files are much smaller than a mysql database. It’s the easiest to maintain, easiest to run. And if you want to remove a player from your server, all you gotta do is right click and delete! bam all there stuff is gone![/quote]</p>
<p>You’re an idiot and if your good friend really told you that then he must be an idiot too. Relational databases exist and flat text files are not used for a reason. If you start using flat text files and put everything to do with a player in a single text file then at some point you start multiplying data. Not to mention that to handle these text files as a database you’d have to write your own custom parsers.</p>
