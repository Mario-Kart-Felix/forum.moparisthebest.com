        <p>[quote=“Gety4some, post:80, topic:399831”]There are things you are forgetting though. Sleeping times vary when doing it legit and vary when doing it with a bot. So what your telling me is, this. If I am afk training, sleeping at 96 fatigue every time, and have been afking for 7 hours I could be banned, because I have been on for a while? These commands are here for a reason and are not annoying to players when they are used correctly. ANYONE who isn’t botting will say something if they have to sleep 2 times in 30 seconds. A mod would never have to sleep someone more than twice. If they do then get rid of them for being a nuisance. I honestly think you guys are taking useful tools away from the mods. I can kind of see the mods not having teleport and summon because it can be easily abused. You should how ever allow them to use the goto command to allow them to easily go to a player to help them. It is much easier and faster for both the mod and the player waiting for assistance.</p>
<p>Rambling paragraph I know. Sozzzz[/quote]<br>
If they keep logs as in depth as he’s implying, I somewhat doubt there will be anything to “forget,” since they’d have essentially everything you do on record.</p>
<p>You also seem to be concerned that a mod could mistake someone legit playing for 7 hours for a bot, but that’s really no different than it was with the video system on other servers. There’s always room for error when someone is incompetent or there’s a variable they’re not aware of. However, if the mods are given all the information they could possibly need, then it’s simply a matter of interpretation, and as code said, at that point it just takes a little “detective” work.</p>
<p>I think this concept is a good idea. On RSCE, mods had to watch players for a while generally to get an idea of who to check, then go through a tedious process of using limited powers to get often ambiguous proof. The mods are meant to get irrefutable proof so sometimes that would record a good 10+ minutes of footage for <span class="bbcode-u">one</span> botter. That’s final cut, which doesn’t include unusable video or pre-recording watching, etc.</p>
<p>Not to mention, once this is all said and done, most people simply appealed the ban regardless of how obvious it was that they were botting, which meant that another mod had to look into their case and watch their video. The system proposed here would mean any mod could simply look at the time the person in question was banned, and check the corresponding logs to verify the other mod’s actions.</p>
<p>I believe the decreased risk of potential ambiguity with catching botters with this system will lead to an overall better player+mod relationship. If bans are made based on complete logs that anyone can look at (and I believe these sorts of logs should be available to even normal players, if possible) then there’s less of a chance that random botters will cry about mod corruption and incompetence purely because they got caught and they’re mad.</p>
<p>Couple that with a strictly enforced no-botting prerogative from the get-go, and there’s thhe potential for a truly bot-free server. I do think, however, that at least until mods can learn what the logs “look” like in game, they should have non-leveling, non-trading mod accounts with the ability to teleport their account and only their account, invisibly, to other players. While the log system is probably going to be golden, having fresh mods looking at a stream of data seems like it might be a bit overwhelming for them.</p>
<p>It might be easier to make a bot sweep purely by teleporting to each player online one by one and using their eyes to get an idea of whose logs they need to look into.</p>

MoparRSC’s stated goal is to have absolutely no botting. RSCE couldn’t handle that because the community was spoiled. Bots were left alone for ages, and even those caught multiple times were often released.</p>
<p>I’m sorry if you see me as incompetent for trying to get rid of the bots, but if that’s your opinion, you honestly have no idea just how many bots were running around prior to actually cracking down a little… or you simply believe that a server can’t thrive without one guy running 6 auto-thievers hidden away on paladins, or people remaking countless mining/fishing/leveling/looting bots mere minutes after being banned simply because actually getting a response about a requested IP ban takes days (if you’re ever to get a response).</p>
<p>I empathize with them. Truly, I do. Everyone has gotten older, and has some degree of responsibility in life now. There just isn’t the same amount of time in the day to waste on getting food and funds for pking, which is the main attraction to a lot of players seeking out RSC servers. It’s a hassle to get the stats or funds needed to enjoy yourself in the little spare time you have. It doesn’t justify letting the bots run free though.</p>
<p>When new players log on and see dozens of bots roaming about unchecked, it doesn’t make the server seem appealing, it makes it seem like the admins don’t care. And the saddest part is, there really aren’t many other decent options currently, because RSCE is the only “stable” RSC server with a somewhat decent following. They resign themselves to give up and wait on another server or try to enjoy what’s available. So they’re either going to be forever at a disadvantage due to “everyone” else botting, or be driven to botting themselves. That path is the path to the way RS2 is now, pretty much. The majority of the population bots, and it’s so all-consuming that Jagex can’t do shit to stop it. Not that it matters, of course, as long as the money comes in, they’re golden.</p>
<p>Forgive me for putting in a little effort over a short period of time in an attempt to try to save RSCE from the same fate. I just don’t particularly want to see the RSC community die out. I, and many others, have been a part of it for a decade now, it seems. It may seem ridiculous to you, but I’d like to think that I could type in a net search another decade from now, and find a place where a few of the same people still congregate.</p>
<p>Ah, and it’s not really hard to write a few paragraphs in a few minutes, though I apologize if my tendency towards lengthy e-blather upsets you. You’re not <span class="bbcode-u">obligated</span> to read it though.</p>

<p>It would also give them a massive advantage, and a huge potential to abuse.</p>
<p>Also, you’re looking at this like all moderators are doing is busting their ass catching botters by using annoying (to legit players) commands on players.  Moderators should just play the game normally, and converse with people when playing.  If you see someone botting, then that’s a bonus; if you want to hunt for bots, then go do it like you did on the original RSC.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next point, you don’t need special commands to figure out someone is botting.  The overwhelming majority of the time you can mess the bot up, and get it to no act like a human.  For the times you can’t, then you go check out the logs.</p>
<p>One of the major issues is mods think someone is botting, then they refuse to accept the evidence, and try to ‘find’ some that confirms their suspicions.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Without commands like “fatigue” or w/e, how do you expect mods to catch anyone afk botting? As in, standing in one spot training and sleeping/relogging. Pretty hard to prove that. Not to mention, if the bot/script is good enough it’s pretty hard to trap a bot.</p>
<p>Although I do agree that the best way to catch bots is by updating the client regularly and adding traps, assuming that’s what your are implying will be the case.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Any competent mod could figure it out…  It’s not hard to see how long they’re training for, and couple that with mouse movements, sleeping times, etc. it won’t be difficult.</p>

<p>There are things you are forgetting though. Sleeping times vary when doing it legit and vary when doing it with a bot. So what your telling me is, this. If I am afk training, sleeping at 96 fatigue every time, and have been afking for 7 hours I could be banned, because I have been on for a while? These commands are here for a reason and are not annoying to players when they are used correctly. ANYONE who isn’t botting will say something if they have to sleep 2 times in 30 seconds. A mod would never have to sleep someone more than twice. If they do then get rid of them for being a nuisance. I honestly think you guys are taking useful tools away from the mods. I can kind of see the mods not having teleport and summon because it can be easily abused. You should how ever allow them to use the goto command to allow them to easily go to a player to help them. It is much easier and faster for both the mod and the player waiting for assistance.</p>

<p>You’re assuming mods will be allowed to ban people purely on suspicion, and that people must prove they’re innocent, because they’re assumed guilty.</p>
<p>If there isn’t overwhelming proof, and there is no way to guarantee they were botting, then they’re not banned.</p>
<p>Also, the fatigue command does absolutely nothing but annoy players.  If I had to enter a captcha 2-3 times within a minute I’d be pissed, and there are others that wouldn’t say anything because they’d just think it was a bug or something.

<p>It would also give them a massive advantage, and a huge potential to abuse.</p>
<p>Also, you’re looking at this like all moderators are doing is busting their ass catching botters by using annoying (to legit players) commands on players.  Moderators should just play the game normally, and converse with people when playing.  If you see someone botting, then that’s a bonus; if you want to hunt for bots, then go do it like you did on the original RSC.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next point, you don’t need special commands to figure out someone is botting.  The overwhelming majority of the time you can mess the bot up, and get it to no act like a human.  For the times you can’t, then you go check out the logs.</p>
<p>One of the major issues is mods think someone is botting, then they refuse to accept the evidence, and try to ‘find’ some that confirms their suspicions.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Without commands like “fatigue” or w/e, how do you expect mods to catch anyone afk botting? As in, standing in one spot training and sleeping/relogging. Pretty hard to prove that. Not to mention, if the bot/script is good enough it’s pretty hard to trap a bot.</p>
<p>Although I do agree that the best way to catch bots is by updating the client regularly and adding traps, assuming that’s what your are implying will be the case.</p>

In Re to the idiot claiming I am a botter, just stfu before you embarrass yourself. I’m a former mod of three smaller servers and have never used a bot before. I don’t in the least agree with botting, but I do realize that it is ABSOLUTELY necessary to have botters to sustain a stable server. It’s a fact that we HAVE to deal with. I am just trying to make sure that whoever is modded has the proper tools needed to keep the botters in check.</p>

        <p>Your talking about emu a server which is based on botting because that is what it and some community members have become. What the scene needs is a legit replica a server that can be around and can be taken seriously. The only thing serious about RSCE is the website. I know xEnt got attention of some of the best developers and staff members for this project but that is what not is going to make the server. The players hand down make any server all we can do as staff is guide it to the correct direction. Botting will not be tolerated on the server as it ruins the fun for the players who play legit… If we have 500  legit player well that is great. If we have 5 legit players well we have 5 players and I will be willing to pay for the hosting fee to keep the server up and running smoothly as long as it has the staff support.</p>

I’m too used to looking at things directly perhaps. How in depth will the logs and whatnot be for every player, and how long will you be able to keep the logs before they get overwritten? If they do have to be overwritten after a period, will the logs for banned characters get saved separately in case they need to be referenced at a later date?</p>

<p>You don’t agree with botting, yet you think that botting is acceptable (to some degree), because it is both inevitable and can’t be completely stopped. I can’t hope to understand the actual scripting/coding done behind all of this, but I do know that bots are extremely obvious to anyone who bothers to watch. If they’re putting in all this effort to maintain a bot-free server, and they have people who have coded bots working hand in hand with the game coders to figure out the signs that bots will show, <span class="bbcode-u">and</span> they’re keeping logs of <span class="bbcode-u">everything</span>… then I think they can actually do it.</p>
<p>You say you’re against botting, but you’ve resigned yourself to the belief that a private RSC server absolutely <span class="bbcode-u">needs</span> bots to stay afloat. That belief system seems to be based on the fact that no other server has been able to achieve and maintain that goal before, not even Jagex’s original servers. Wouldn’t bot-free server appeal to someone like you, who has repeatedly claimed to be against bots and botting in general? I think their goal is admirable, and I believe it to be something that can actually be done, as long as the staff actually give a damn.</p>

<p>As I said before, much of RSCE’s community was spoiled by being “allowed” to bot. Either through admin apathy or mods ignoring them, allowing friends to bot, or simply giving second, third, and eighteenth chances, the server learned that there rarely was a permanent punishment for botting.</p>
<p>And, while people bitched and complained bitterly when a new mod started banning every bot in sight, not just thievers and low levels but mains caught botting as well, the player count actually went up during that early period. RSCE had 140-180 online, but a good 30-60 characters were merely bots running around. Sure, it makes it look like there’s more online, but those aren’t actual players, or even individual players, but rather people running 2-9 bots(yes, one guy had 9 thievers on at once) on a single IP. The player count total dipped down to 120-150ish during that period, but if you take into account the bots that were tossed out, more people were actually <span class="bbcode-u">playing</span> for some reason.</p>
<p>A legit server seems fun to me, whether RSCE after all the bots are somehow removed, or MoparRSC never allowing bots in the first place.</p>

If the goal is to have a completely bot-free server, then there needs to be at least some way for the staff to be able to keep an eye of everyone, not just the people in high traffic areas that might get noticed. Will your log system have any particular way to auto-detect people whose actions appear to resemble a bots, and create a list of these characters or something along those lines?</p>
<p>[quote author=IlikeArrays link=topic=496947.msg3648655#msg3648655 date=1309563315]Again, I removed teleport commands completely out of the commandhandler because they are irrelevant.</p>
<p>Tbh, many of the bot developers are behind the server themselves and we understand what to look for.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I’m too used to looking at things directly perhaps. How in depth will the logs and whatnot be for every player, and how long will you be able to keep the logs before they get overwritten? If they do have to be overwritten after a period, will the logs for banned characters get saved separately in case they need to be referenced at a later date?</p>

<p>I don’t in the least agree with botting, but I do realize that it is ABSOLUTELY necessary to have botters to sustain a stable server. It’s a fact that we HAVE to deal with. I am just trying to make sure that whoever is modded has the proper tools needed to keep the botters in check.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You don’t agree with botting, yet you think that botting is acceptable (to some degree), because it is both inevitable and can’t be completely stopped. I can’t hope to understand the actual scripting/coding done behind all of this, but I do know that bots are extremely obvious to anyone who bothers to watch. If they’re putting in all this effort to maintain a bot-free server, and they have people who have coded bots working hand in hand with the game coders to figure out the signs that bots will show, <span class="bbcode-u">and</span> they’re keeping logs of <span class="bbcode-u">everything</span>… then I think they can actually do it.</p>
<p>You say you’re against botting, but you’ve resigned yourself to the belief that a private RSC server absolutely <span class="bbcode-u">needs</span> bots to stay afloat. That belief system seems to be based on the fact that no other server has been able to achieve and maintain that goal before, not even Jagex’s original servers. Wouldn’t bot-free server appeal to someone like you, who has repeatedly claimed to be against bots and botting in general? I think their goal is admirable, and I believe it to be something that can actually be done, as long as the staff actually give a damn.</p>

<p>They should never need to be removed, and why waste time and effort separating banned people from the logs?  It’s going to be stored in a database…</p>

I typed up a long boring post about messing around in a text document trying to estimate how large the logs might be over the course of a year, but I’m sure you all have figured out a way to keep the size in check. That was the only reason I asked about the logs being overwritten after a period of time, since I figured they might end up getting too massive for the servers to hold.</p>
