    <title>I am legend</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-am-legend/165285</link>
    <description>Well, after seeing the previews every time I watched TV I decided that it was necessary to go see the movie, I am Legend. It is the new Will Smith movie and I have to say it was pretty decent in quality.

 Will Smith portrays a man who stays behind in New York after it has been quarantined because of the &quot;KV Virus.&quot; The virus is created when a cure for cancer mutates killing nearly everyone who has been &quot;cured.&quot; The virus becomes airborne killing most of the population and changing the rest into monsters of sorts. These monsters are described as being in an advanced rabies like state, they only come out at night and pretty much attack anything that moves. Will Smith&#39;s character, Robert Neville, and his dog Samantha &quot;Sam&quot;, are the only sane survivors in New York. Robert chose to stay behind to try to develop a cure for the KV Virus. 

[Spoiler Warning: Skip the next paragraph if you don&#39;t want the ending ruined for you]

[size=7pt]I have to say there has never been a movie that has been emotional enough to make me cry, but this movie did succeed in doing so. The part that made me cry is when Robert basically goes off the deep end putting him and his dog in danger and resulting in Sam getting infected. He rushes her back to his lab and tries everything he can to save her, however, holding her in his arms she starts trying to bite him and her fur starts to fall out. He restrains her and eventually ends up having to strangle her to death. This causes Robert to snap, he goes out after dark and tries to kill many of the infected and almost dies himself until he is rescued by two other survivors, Anna and Ethan. Anna and Ethan are survivors from Maryland that had heard Roberts radio message. You find out that the infected followed them back to Roberts house and attack, this causes Robert, Anna, and Ethan to become corned in the lab and in a final act of self sacrifice Robert saves Anna and Ethan. He hands Anna a vial full of blood and says &quot;The cure is in her blood&quot;. He than kills himself and all the other infected in the lab using a hand grenade. Quite heart touching, eh?[/size]

[/Spoiler]

I&#39;d give this movie a 9/10.</description>

Will Smith was pretty damn good in I Am Legend. Tree’s reasons are completely valid. Who wants to watch a movie with no definite ending? Action scenes were brief and few. And finally, yes, the lack of nudity was disappointing.<br>

              <p>Horrible movie. Don’t even bother to go watch it or even rent it. Here is the storyline:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">- Drive expensive car.
- Hunt deer
- Go home
- Eat dinner
- Go Deer hunting
- Look at infected rats
- Wait for people
- Deer hunting
- Goes to lab
- Look for food
- Deer hunting
- Dog dies
- Main characters goes suicidal and crashes his car
- Main character gets rescued (what are the chances *Rolls eyes*)
- Two new characters
- Two new characters fuck everything up
- 'Night Seekers' attack
- Will smith sacrifices himself to save his cure!
- Two other characters find more survivors.
- The end.</code></pre>
<p>[/spoilers]</p>
<p>There are a few reasons this is horrible.</p>
<ol>
<li>No real action.</li>
<li>All Night Seekers look the same imo (No kids?)</li>
<li>No real reason to create the ‘cure’. 90 percent were dead and a lot more were eaten.</li>
<li>No resolution.</li>
<li>No nudity. Every good Survival movie has nudity.</li>
</ol>
<p>A movie with no resolution equals a fail. This may have been as bad a 28 days later where the whole movie turned to shit at the end, almost like the movies script writers had gone “Fuck it!”. Waste of my time.</p>
<p>btw Will Smith didn’t do that bad. Good acting imo.</p>

It made me laugh so much when the manakin some how moved (I’m not sure how actually, i think i missed why that happened) but it made me laugh at wills reaction to this.</p>
<p>It made me cry when of course he had to kill his only friend left - his dog.</p>
<p>It made me scared when will had to go through pitch black to find his dog and then when he moved the light he was holding he realized the infected were right there close to him.[/size]</p>

Scariest… to me… was at the beginning during his first or second dream where an infected human jumps on the passenger side of the car’s window and blood splatters on it. Was really unexpected.<br>
The ending, to me, was towards the lame-side. Read the spoiler in first post for more.</p>

Btw, I am Legend was based on the novel of the same name and is, essentially, a remake of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omega_Man" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Omega Man</a><br>
[/unrelated][/quote]</p>
<p>How is that unrelated?<br>
The Novel is actually about vampires but they changed it into kind of like the zombies from 28 days/weeks later (Fast and crazy)</p>
<p>EDIT: I just watched the crazy shit… I shit myself a few times but when he had to kill his dog I had to hold back the tears a bit :(.</p>
