    <title>Custom Themes?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-themes/306531</link>
    <description>Hello, I am trying to find/make a custom purple them for my client, hence the background, loader bar, and other things are purple. I have a decompiled green class, but I have no clue how to change the ColorUIResources. The Green one is as follows:
[code]
  public GreenTheme()
  {
    this.primary1 = new ColorUIResource(51, 102, 51);
    this.primary2 = new ColorUIResource(102, 153, 102);
    this.primary3 = new ColorUIResource(153, 204, 153);
    this.secondary1 = new ColorUIResource(30, 190, 30);
    this.secondary2 = new ColorUIResource(120, 120, 120);
    this.secondary3 = new ColorUIResource(238, 255, 238);
  }
[/code]

If anyone has any clue on what to change the numbers to, or if anyone knows where to find these color Id&#39;s, please post.
Also, if anyone already has a purple theme, please post a link for me.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 06, 2009, 02:48:58 pm[/size][hr]Anyone know how to do this?</description>
