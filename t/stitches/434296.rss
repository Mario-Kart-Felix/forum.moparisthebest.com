<p>when the fuck were guns/weapons ever illegal in america?[/quote]<br>
Lots of weapons have been illegal over the years, like the knives I mentioned.  Also, I meant when no weapons were legal for law-abiding citizens to carry, at least in my state of Ohio.</p>
<p>In some states/localities, guns are still ‘illegal’ for a law-abiding citizen to own.  Illinois, New York, and California are some of the worst culprits, by the letter of the law you can own a gun there (but not carry it!), but in practice you have to apply for permits and wait a very long time and generally can’t get what you want.</p>

Tazzers are only safe if you don’t use them, there is no safe and non-safe usage.[/quote]</p>
<p>Despite the growing controversy, a study funded by the U.S. Justice Department asserted that the majority of people tasered from July 2005 to June 2007 suffered no injury. A study led by William Bozeman, of the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, of nearly 1,000 persons subjected to Taser use, concluded that 99.7% of the cases had either minor injuries, such as scrapes and bruises, or none at all; while three persons suffered injuries severe enough to need hospital admission, two of them resulting in death. Their autopsy reports indicated neither death was related to the use of a Taser.</p>
