    <title>Why did they shut down rs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-did-they-shut-down-rs/5176</link>
    <description>ok i ask this because the day befor it was shut down me and my cousin had about 30 bots at bank doors closing them so people could not get in and claiming that it would shut down at midnight(as a prank). midnight came and we had another script just to go to popular areas and say we were joking. the next day i heard that it was shut down, me and my cuzin were just like ho-ly-shit.

the reason i dont know why it did was because they day after it shut down i stopped playing, deleted my cookies and didnt return for a long time.  i know it is not shut down but if this site starts charging money to go to, its shut down end of story.

edit, changed title i refuse to call it rsc, becuase rs should be called new runesacape.</description>
