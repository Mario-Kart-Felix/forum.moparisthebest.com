    <title>Custom Item ID/Pickup/In-server Problem?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-item-id-pickup-in-server-problem/341728</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;KingKj52, post:10, topic:341714&quot;]Hmm, it didn&#39;t work. Now, there was improvement, it didn&#39;t say &quot;No item found.&quot;, but it didn&#39;t have any effect. I checked the log, and it showed the command entering, but there was no item added. I then checked if the code became faulty by some idiot mistake I would have probably made, so I &quot;::pickup 995 1&quot;&#39;d and it worked fine. Is there something I&#39;m missing?

Edit: The pickup code is as follows:

[code]	    if (command.startsWith(&quot;pickup&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) {
		        String[] args = command.split(&quot; &quot;);
	         if(args.length == 3) {
			int newItemID = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
			int newItemAmount = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);
			if (newItemID &lt;= 160000 &amp;&amp; newItemID &gt;= 0) {
				addItem(newItemID, newItemAmount);
			} else {
				sM(&quot;No such item.&quot;);
			}
		} else {
			sM(&quot;Oops! Use as ::pickup 995 100&quot;);
		}
	    }
}[/code]

I noticed what message it should send in the &quot;else&quot; statements, but, neither of those messages where sent, implying it worked, the item just isn&#39;t there. I ran my mouse through each posistion of the inventory, and no name showed up [as in checking for a faulty model].

Edit2: I added the item manually to my bank, and when I opened the bank, it showed itself as dwarf remains, and then crashed me. Every time I opened the bank, I got the same result until, after 3 times, it did not automatically re-connect. Any help?

Server bat said this:

[code]Exception encountered while parsing incoming packets from Kingkj52.
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 19999
        at client.fromBank(client.java:9972)

        at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)
ClientHandler: Client Kingkj52 disconnected (127.0.0.1)[/code]

I&#39;m guessing there is some sort of limit on how high the id goes all around. How or where can I change that?[/quote]

I made a custom item and all the id&#39;s and what not and the client-sided stuff is ok, but that is the problem now. Can anyone help?

[sorry for re-post, I just figured this specific problem is now server-sided]</description>

              <p>Its alright, I got it! It was 50000 [yeah, big, I know] because the base had many customs built in, so I made a copy of all the server+client files and set it to 15000 and worked like a charm. I simply assumed from the “Bank.ID &lt;19999” that it had to be less than that.  Thanks to everyone, you guys are a lot more helpful now adays ^_^.</p>
