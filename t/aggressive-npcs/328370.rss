    <title>Aggressive NPC&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/aggressive-npcs/328370</link>
    <description>Well currently I am creating a new type of mini-game.
Well The NPC&#39;s will spawn as in SummonNewNPC, but the only problem there is.. is that they are not aggressive to the player.
Keep in mind, that this is a multi zone so that an NPC could lets say attack a player then after the player dies the NPC will switch over and attack a different player..

thanks,
Lkc</description>
