    <description>[size=14pt]YES, I AM PRESS X FOR SEX, OFF OF R00N-SERBA...[/size]

Welcome, to Superiority #474.

First off, allow me to get correct credits:
Gharam&lt;3
Vigan&lt;3
Arthion&lt;3 (server)
Me&lt;3
--------------------------------------------------
First off, allow me to post, how the server is packaged.
Bin-Com-Superiority-[Event, io, Model, Net, Util, World] - Basic class files.
      Data-[Banned, Characters, Connections, Items, Logs, Mapdata, NPC]
Lib-[mina-core-2.0.0-M6]
Org-apache-mina-[core, filter, handler, proxy, transport, util]
Src-Com-Superiority-[Event, io, Model, Net, Util, World] - Basic Java files.

Just wanted to clear that up :).

The story..
This all started, due to Vigans release of MANY, 474&#39;s. Many all posted on them saying how they would start a server, yet i have yet to see one in the development section, on something being worked on that looks decent. So i figured, meh, i&#39;ll give it a shot. It isn&#39;t as hard as it looks. Everything seems too come to you, and thinks to Vigan, clearing things up and making things workable, this project was a VERY, easy start.

~The Base~
Vigans base, is EXTREMLEY stable. I have flooded 500 players on, (keep in mind, the players were not doing anything) and the lag was, not there! If i ever get around to hosting this, expect no lagg.

~Maps~
In a #474, maps are everything. Everyone wants to see; Godwars, Castlewars, Grandexchange, and all that good stuff. Of course, i loaded it in. The cache it was ripper from, left many wholes in large objects, such as buildings, houses [etc..], but will be fixed soon. The most recent map to add, was grandexchange. However, i could not find the objects.. So as of now, it is just a location on the map. Godwars was loaded in, along with clan wars, and bounty hunter. I also, added in new objects, in major cities.. [varrok, falador, etc..]

~Skills~
I have currently started on 4 skills;
Prayer - [COLOR=&quot;Lime&quot;]COMPLETE[/COLOR] - Full prayer draining, bone burying, all prayer bonuses are working, as well as prayer pot. and prayer restortion at altar.
Thieving - [COLOR=&quot;LIME&quot;]COMPLETE[/COLOR] - Full pickpocketing, with failure animation/gfx. Thieving from stalls, was recently added, though i forgot pictures..
Firemaking - [COLOR=&quot;Yellow&quot;]STARTED..[/COLOR] - Not yet complete, so far it&#39;s a basic usage of item-on-item (tinderbox on logs). Once i get around too it, i will write the corresponding file, so that it may add experince, and what not.
Cooking - [COLOR=&quot;Yellow&quot;]STARTED..[/COLOR] - Not yet complete; again, utilized the usage of item-on-object; any raw item use it on a stove, range, or any fire, and you shall cook an item!

~Trading~
A little buggy, on the second trading screen, when it shows what you are trading, the players name is displayed twice, and on the first screen, it dosen&#39;t say &quot;the other player has accepted&quot; or &quot;waiting for other player&quot;

[spoiler=click here, for trading screenshots!][IMG]http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/TRADING1.jpg[/img] [IMG]http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/TRADING2.jpg[/img] [IMG]http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/TRADING3.jpg[/img][/spoiler]

~Shops~
As of now, the shops were ripped from Arthion :s.. Although, i do understand the coding now, and will get tons more added. I don&#39;t want this too be an old school re-make, and all of the boring shit.. I want it too be a decent, good pking/skilling server. Anyways,  the shops are pretty basic. As of now, only have four. I only took one screenshot, to show how it&#39;s set up, but here ya go:

[IMG]http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/SHOPS2-1.png[/img]

~Item on ground handle~
This, upset me. In order to get NPC drops working, i ad to write up a file, that handles item on ground. This is 100%, it&#39;s not much, it&#39;s little, but it&#39;s the little things that make a server stand out, and look well. In this picture, i dropped 2 coins, from my inventory. It shows the 2 coins ON the ground stacked, the red dot on the mini-map, showing there is an item on the ground, and right click &quot;Pick up-walk here-examine&quot;. Simple, but i like it (:.

[spoiler=item on ground, for teh lulZ][IMG]http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/ITEMONGROUND.jpg[/img][/spoiler]

~PVP/PVNPC~
Before anything, i wanted to get player-vs-npc working, and decent. It&#39;s pretty good, and handled by a few diffrent packets. I like (:. Player-vs-player, is exceptional. Combat is, &#39;shitty&#39; but it will be up to you guys, to work on that. I just basically, threw it all together, and what is done is done. PVNPC, had to be done. I feel like, all anyone cares about in a server is &quot;GAWDWARZ&quot;. So, i threw it in here. Mapdata+NPCS.

[spoiler=Bandos+GodWars Mapdata][IMG]http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/GODWARS.jpg[/img][/spoiler]

No, back on PVNPC. Here is another quick screenshot, of me killing a man :D!

[spoiler=Me killing a MaN][IMG]http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/PVNPC.jpg[/img][/spoiler]

Alright guys, that about closes&#39;s it all up! I don&#39;t want any help on this server, so i&#39;m not asking anyone to helpe me out. Just support me :}. Post on the thread, rep if you would like, it dosen&#39;t really bother me.</description>

<p>Welcome, to Superiority <span class="hashtag">#474</span>.</p>
<h2>First off, allow me to get correct credits:<br>
Gharam&lt;3<br>
Vigan&lt;3<br>
Arthion&lt;3 (server)<br>
Me&lt;3</h2>
<p>First off, allow me to post, how the server is packaged.<br>
Bin-Com-Superiority-[Event, io, Model, Net, Util, World] - Basic class files.<br>
Data-[Banned, Characters, Connections, Items, Logs, Mapdata, NPC]<br>
Lib-[mina-core-2.0.0-M6]<br>
Org-apache-mina-[core, filter, handler, proxy, transport, util]<br>
Src-Com-Superiority-[Event, io, Model, Net, Util, World] - Basic Java files.</p>
<p>Just wanted to clear that up :).</p>
<p>The story…<br>
This all started, due to Vigans release of MANY, 474’s. Many all posted on them saying how they would start a server, yet i have yet to see one in the development section, on something being worked on that looks decent. So i figured, meh, i’ll give it a shot. It isn’t as hard as it looks. Everything seems too come to you, and thinks to Vigan, clearing things up and making things workable, this project was a VERY, easy start.</p>
<p>~The Base~<br>
Vigans base, is EXTREMLEY stable. I have flooded 500 players on, (keep in mind, the players were not doing anything) and the lag was, not there! If i ever get around to hosting this, expect no lagg.</p>
<p>~Maps~<br>
In a <span class="hashtag">#474</span>, maps are everything. Everyone wants to see; Godwars, Castlewars, Grandexchange, and all that good stuff. Of course, i loaded it in. The cache it was ripper from, left many wholes in large objects, such as buildings, houses [etc…], but will be fixed soon. The most recent map to add, was grandexchange. However, i could not find the objects… So as of now, it is just a location on the map. Godwars was loaded in, along with clan wars, and bounty hunter. I also, added in new objects, in major cities… [varrok, falador, etc…]</p>
<p>[spoiler=Click here, to view the new city areas]<img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/Capture_023.jpg" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/Capture_022.jpg" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/Capture_021.jpg" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/Capture_020.jpg" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/Capture_018.jpg" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/Capture_017.jpg" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/Capture_015.jpg" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/Capture_014.jpg" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/Capture_013.jpg" alt width="" height="">[/spoiler]</p>
<p>~Skills~<br>
I have currently started on 4 skills;<br>
Prayer - [COLOR=“Lime”]COMPLETE[/COLOR] - Full prayer draining, bone burying, all prayer bonuses are working, as well as prayer pot. and prayer restortion at altar.<br>
Thieving - [COLOR=“LIME”]COMPLETE[/COLOR] - Full pickpocketing, with failure animation/gfx. Thieving from stalls, was recently added, though i forgot pictures…<br>
Firemaking - [COLOR=“Yellow”]STARTED…[/COLOR] - Not yet complete, so far it’s a basic usage of item-on-item (tinderbox on logs). Once i get around too it, i will write the corresponding file, so that it may add experince, and what not.<br>
Cooking - [COLOR=“Yellow”]STARTED…[/COLOR] - Not yet complete; again, utilized the usage of item-on-object; any raw item use it on a stove, range, or any fire, and you shall cook an item!</p>

<p>~Trading~<br>
A little buggy, on the second trading screen, when it shows what you are trading, the players name is displayed twice, and on the first screen, it dosen’t say “the other player has accepted” or “waiting for other player”</p>
<p>[spoiler=click here, for trading screenshots!]<img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/TRADING1.jpg" alt width="" height=""> <img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/TRADING2.jpg" alt width="" height=""> <img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/TRADING3.jpg" alt width="" height="">[/spoiler]</p>
<p>~Shops~<br>
As of now, the shops were ripped from Arthion :s… Although, i do understand the coding now, and will get tons more added. I don’t want this too be an old school re-make, and all of the boring shit… I want it too be a decent, good pking/skilling server. Anyways,  the shops are pretty basic. As of now, only have four. I only took one screenshot, to show how it’s set up, but here ya go:</p>
<p><img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/SHOPS2-1.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>~Item on ground handle~<br>
This, upset me. In order to get NPC drops working, i ad to write up a file, that handles item on ground. This is 100%, it’s not much, it’s little, but it’s the little things that make a server stand out, and look well. In this picture, i dropped 2 coins, from my inventory. It shows the 2 coins ON the ground stacked, the red dot on the mini-map, showing there is an item on the ground, and right click “Pick up-walk here-examine”. Simple, but i like it (:.</p>
<p>[spoiler=item on ground, for teh lulZ]<img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/ITEMONGROUND.jpg" alt width="" height="">[/spoiler]</p>
<p>~PVP/PVNPC~<br>
Before anything, i wanted to get player-vs-npc working, and decent. It’s pretty good, and handled by a few diffrent packets. I like (:. Player-vs-player, is exceptional. Combat is, ‘shitty’ but it will be up to you guys, to work on that. I just basically, threw it all together, and what is done is done. PVNPC, had to be done. I feel like, all anyone cares about in a server is “GAWDWARZ”. So, i threw it in here. Mapdata+NPCS.</p>
<p>[spoiler=Bandos+GodWars Mapdata]<img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/GODWARS.jpg" alt width="" height="">[/spoiler]</p>
<p>No, back on PVNPC. Here is another quick screenshot, of me killing a man :D!</p>
<p>[spoiler=Me killing a MaN]<img src="http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu331/deathlyags/PVNPC.jpg" alt width="" height="">[/spoiler]</p>
<p>Alright guys, that about closes’s it all up! I don’t want any help on this server, so i’m not asking anyone to helpe me out. Just support me :}. Post on the thread, rep if you would like, it dosen’t really bother me.</p>
