    <title>MC login script -testers needed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mc-login-script-testers-needed/416259</link>
    <description>I know this sounds much simpler than it really, but think of cracking purposes. Notch has updated away from using his javascript pages into https so I am looking into updating my launcher to get everything correctly, meaning if there is a needed update, etc. This script is as is, and my code is 100% open source. This is not to steal your password as I know someone will think. You can decompile this using JAD or any other popular reverse engineering program for java if you wish. I know I made this sound hard, but I just needed to re-create the login method Notch uses. I am now trying to update my launcher with the new login shit. Hopefully, after I figure out a valid way to keep my password safe, I will release a new launcher that can auto update, even with a valid or bad login. I may endup just making a PHP page though with falsified information, but to keep up to date with the &quot;latestVersion&quot; crap.

Info I got:
[code]
Username: Soharuda
latestVersion: 1316075312000
downloadTicket: ecc4203fc2c7718eec5e399344f8d7d0
sessionId: 1562770079991997932
[/code]

Download:

NOTE: After you unzip to files, edit Run.bat and replace USERNAME and PASSWORD with legit information please. I just want a post or two saying yes this worked for them.</description>
