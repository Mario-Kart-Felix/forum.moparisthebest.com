I am always taking an extra set of hands to help with this project no matter what type of experience you have!

Looking For:

[b]Web Developer[/b]: Looking for a great web developer who can make something very nice that will Right Off make a great first impression for players who stumble across WarTusk! First impressions really do matter! I want the player to be hooked right when he gets on the website and have just a huge desire to download and start playing!

[b]Artists[/b] I am looking for those who are great at making great images! [EX: Banners,Splash Screens, Pictures, Signatures, Icons, E.T.C] If you have the talent at designing these types of things then please share some of your previous work.

[b]Advertisers[/b] I am looking for advertisers to go around bumping posts/creating posts for WarTusk! This also applies to Video editors! WarTusk really needs some advertising videos for players to watch and see! Now this will be a pretty big task. What type of videos I am looking for?

-First Look Videos

-Unique Content

-How To Play

-Classes (How each class works. EX: Mage,Ranger,Warrior) &quot;Spells,Abilities,Skills&quot; 

-Future Update Videos 

-Weekly Videos

-Commentary Videos

I am just wanting tons of videos to go out for new players to watch so they can learn how to play but what to expect from WarTusk so they do not get so overwhelmed when they first login.


[b]Beta Testers[/b] Need some members to help during the Beta! Focusing on what should be Changed/Added to WarTusk to make the game experience more fun!


[b]Source &amp; Client Developers[/b] 

Not looking for any at the moment until after Beta. But please feel free to leave your information for the future!

<p>Position Applying For: Betatester.</p>
<p>Work Experience: I’ve played Runescape since I 2006-2007ish and have been enjoying it since. I’ve played on and off and have regularly been playing RSPS. I’ve tons of experience from playing Runescape and I think I could contribute with ideas and feedback to help develop the server.</p>
<p>Why you should be part of the WarTusk Team?: As I stated in my last sentence. I’ve feel like I can contribute to this server in a positive way. ’</p>
<p>How much time can you put into this project?: Atleast 1 hour every day, but in the weekend I can play up to 6 hrs in total or even more.</p>
<p>What are some positives and negatives we should know that will effect your position on the team: Negatives would be my timezone. If for example I’m sleeping when you are awake and online and the other way around it could be hard to communicate in a good way, but I still believe I can betatest in a proper way and give a decent feedback on what I like and what I don’t like. An other negative would be exam coming around next week. That will take 2 days of my time, but after that I am good to go.</p>
