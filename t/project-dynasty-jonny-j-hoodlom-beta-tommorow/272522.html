<p>OFFICIAL SERVER LINK IS IN MY SIGNATURE.</p>
<p>Dynasty<br>
…The Next Level Of Revolution…</p>
<p>Please note the following are ACHEIVEMENTS not goals.<br>
Other thread is being deleted to clear clutter ignore it.</p>
<p>The Dynasty Project is a project owned, created and maintained by Jonny J and Hoodlom. Hoodlom, and I have merged the two great projects of: Project Dayz, and JSReborn to create the ultimate in private servers, The Next Level Of Revolution.<br>
Our Aims<br>
Here at Dynasty we will strive to create not only a ‘Revolutionary’ server like the others seen in the Project section, and ones proclaimed around the RuneScape Private Server communities.<br>
WHY?<br>
We are different. Not ‘Different’ like the other servers say they are, how they have new features, and updates people don’t have, and fun things, but think about it. How hard is that? Im gonna keep this short and sweet and let our features do the talking.</p>

</ul>
<p>Player Killing (Pking)</p>
<p>This is where things get serious and the term “The Next Level Of Revolution” shine most.<br>
Days on end of non stop programming, percision timing, and astounding attention to detail has been hauled into the main feature of this server which is our PKing.</p>
<p>Ok. So all servers say there Pking is the best right? How much its ‘Improved’ and how its ‘Perfect’<br>
Pssh, yeah just like ‘DeltaScape’. Its time we got serious on Pking, Alot of people think, Pking is Pking, you hit somebody they hit back, and repeat. but in Dynasty it will unleash an entire new experience for those who do pay attention to the little things. But you have heard this all before right? this bit of text means NOTHING to you. Well let me prove it.</p>
<p>PKing Features</p>
<p>Melee</p>
<ul>
<li>Perfect Special Attacks. - 100%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Every Special has been perfectly tuned EXACTLY like RuneScapes, (One thing they did right was their combat)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Max Hit Formula. - 100%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After searching and researching over 20 commonly uses max hit formulas and studying their minor variables we have found the median of them all to come together with what is thought to be the most accurate damage calculator known to RuneScape servers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Timing - 100%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An important key feature in all server is the timing, it can putting it simply “Make or break” a server. With much effort, we have timed every weapon individually to ensure perfect combat timing for all weapons, switching, specials, and combos.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bonus - 100%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Due to our ‘Perfect’ Formula and Timing, its obvious the only sensible thing to do was the make our Bonus’s as near RuneScape as possible, except we have tweaked a few for some added hits, defence, and risk when pking, for that adrenaline rush we all love.</li>
</ul>
<p>Range</p>
<ul>
<li>Projectiles - 100%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One of the most debated and criticized topics in Range is the projectiles, In Dynasty we have PERFECT projectile speed, slope, and hit ratio, if your further away the arrow will go faster, and slope at a different angle, and depending on your range level may just hit your opponent.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Speed &amp; Specials. - 100%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Range speed is a very dodgy issue, way off on most servers, but as Range is Dynasty’s creators favorite skill he has perfected each and every detail to the slightest.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Damage Ratio. - 100%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Much the same to our Melee ratio, after much research we have perfected a Range formula that is better then any known server currently running.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bonus, Defence, Armour. - 100%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Due to my Love of range, every item related to range, Attack and Defence wise, has been tweaked to give range the perfect ability, hits and speed all Rangers love. and with the right combos, armor, and skill, you may be able to bring down any meleer <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">
</li>
</ul>
<p>Magic</p>
<ul>
<li>Spells - 100%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Magic, what do you think? Spells. This is why we have Perfected each and every spell in all our 3 spellbooks, including Modern, Ancient, and Lunar magics (Magiks). All weaking spells, All effects, All graphics, you name it our magic has it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Projectiles - 100%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Graphics, what makes Magic so epic? The awesome graphics and flying colors that come with it! haha that’s why we have made sure all our graphics, like everything else, is better then any other server seen.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Requirements - 100%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As magic is seen as the weakest skill in the Combat triangle (Melee, Range, Magic) we have spiced it up a bit, Increasing Magic armor bonus’s to hit a little harder, and be a little more effective, only to even up the score for those who wish to be pure mages or use it as a more effective combat tactic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Teleports - 100%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Due to the large amount of new areas in Dynasty, ALL Teleports will not require runes or levels. just thought id let you know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Skills</p>
<p>Skills. One of the most important features in Dynasty, as it is the Base and heart of our ever growing economy.</p>
<p>In each server researched, the EXP rates for Non-Combat skills were not balanced. In other words, say combat exp was 100X RS speed, some skills were 300X RS speed.</p>
<p>Also, skills were done very poorly/rushed.</p>
<p>I have re-done every skill completely from scratch, all experience rates have been set specifically to 10x RS exp rates.</p>
<p>Fishing - 100%<br>
The fishing in Dynasty is probably the best fishing in any server. There ALL fish, catching multiple fish from one spot (etc. tuna/swordfish). Fishing speed is adjusted due to which fish you are fishing for, and your fishing level! I even took the time to add a monkfish fishing spot.</p>
<p>Cooking - 100%<br>
This skill (Unlike other servers) Has its burn rate formula more realistic to RS. If you are wearing a cooking cape (100 cooking) and cooking gauntlets, you will rarely burn Manta Rays. Burning is based on mostly cooking level. But we have also endured to make this our first ‘Full’ skill, no skill on ANY server has EVER had a full skill, with EVERY cookable food, with the exact ingrediants as RuneScape</p>
<p>Woodcutting - 100%<br>
The woodcutting in Dynasty is awesome, there are all types logs, you can cut trees from any angles, dragon axe works with the correct cut emote. The time it takes to cut a log is based off the tree you are cutting, the axe you are wielding, and your woodcutting level.</p>
<p>Thieving - 100%<br>
This skill can be a decent money-maker if your into clicking alot. Although there is only NPC pick-pocketing, you need thieving as a requirement for certain quests.</p>
<p>Fletching - 100%<br>
This skill is, in my opinion, the most helpful. It works exactly like Runescape, including dart fletching, all bows, bowstrings, arrow shafts, all arrows, Dragon Arrows, and Dragon Darts. It proves to be a great money maker.</p>
<p>Crafting - 100%<br>
This skill is mainly going to provide Dragonhide, but to keep the price of dragonhide from sky-rocketing a few changes have been made. This is the only way to get a fury amulet though and crafting can prove to be a real money maker.</p>
<p>RuneCrafting - 100%<br>
Runecrafting will be mainly completed through the abyss after the completion of the Rune-Mysteries quest. You still need the respective essence to craft, the rune multiplier table has been tweaked to mesh with the economy.</p>
<p>Herblore - 100%<br>
While I was developing this skill, I came to the conclusion that second ingredients were a waste of time. Instead of getting herbs on a vial of water to get an unfinished potion, you get “Unids” from npcs. Unidentified herbs are then Identified and can be used on a vial of water to produce a potion. This is to keep the supply of potions high.</p>
<p>Slayer - 100%<br>
This skill proves to be also a very good money maker while providing combat rate. I will soon be adding black masks (Affects both Melee AND range max hits) so that players can receive a nice boost in max hit while slaying. Tasks are given out by slayer master, and each task even gives “Slayer Points” which can be used to purchase a black mask OR skip the current task assigned. Monster assigned depends on your slayer level and your combat level. A level 70 with 52 slayer wont be assigned abbysal demons.</p>
<p>Combat In Detail</p>
<p>Here is all our combat in detail</p>
<p>Basic Combat System</p>
<p>The Basic Combat system has been worked on over a long period of time. Every week or so, we actually re-do our max hit formulas because they would be off by two or three. Things like that have been taken care of.</p>
<p>We also took a good long look at timers and delays for weapons. While watching many Runescape PK videos, we came to the conclusion that Runescape has messed up delays, as they are not constant. We have taken the time to develop a combat system that mimics Runescape’s combat system. We have also taken a good long look at combo-ing such as the infamous Blitz-DDS and Range-2h combo. Others such as MSB-Spec to obby maul, darts to dark bow, range - g maul have all been looked at and each work fantastically.</p>
<p>Spoiler for Range 2 Gmaul Combo:</p>
<p>Melee In Detail<br>
-Perfect Delays between animation playing and damage splat appearing - 100%<br>
-Perfected Timers for all weapons - 100%<br>

-Special Attacks (See Above) - 100%<br>
-Comboing works exceptionally well. - 100%<br>
-Prayer works exceptionally well. - 100%<br>
-Chasing in PvP - 100%<br>
-98% RS-Like max hits. - 100%</p>
<p>Range In Detail</p>
<p>-Perfected Delays between arrow pullback and the actual launch - 100%<br>
-Perfected Delay of arrow hitting and Damage splat appearing - 100%<br>
-Perfected timers for Rapid/Accurate/Longrange along with distance being able to shoot - 100%<br>
-Dark Bow perfected - 100%<br>
-Crystal bow perfected - 100%<br>
-Darts Perfected (Bronze-Dragon) - 100%<br>
-Perfected prayers that work exceptionally well - 100%<br>
-Chasing in PvP - 100%<br>
-99% maxhits for ALL weapons. - 100%<br>
-Others I can’t think of off the top of my head - 100%</p>
<p>Magic In Detail</p>
<p>-A highly-advanced splashing system very similar to runescapes. - 100%<br>
-Every spell works. - 100%<br>
-All spell effects work(i.e. smoke barrage poisoning opponents) - 100%<br>
-If you click a spell before you are able to cast it, the server waits until you can successfully cast the spell then casts it. - 100%<br>
-Many secrets that make the magic system VERY closely related to runescapes magic system - 100%<br>
-Autocasting - 100%<br>
-Modern, Ancients, And Lunar magic all fully functional - 100%</p>
<p>Monsters / Npcs.</p>
<p>Several factors make NPCs dull in many servers. As mentioned above, on Dynasty, npcs are clipped and do not twitch/all face south.</p>
<p>Another major problem with NPCs in servers is hitting an npc when it is too far from its original spawn. On OTHER servers, when it gets to the point where its way too far, it just stands there taking the hits.</p>
<p>We did it differently. If you are ranging an npc and you lure it too far away, the npc will retreat, actually walking backwards to try to get you inside its walking range.</p>
<p>We also possess a highly advanced NPCvNPC system. This allows Pest Control to provide the most realistic experience possible. This includes spinners healing portals (Not by attacking the portal <em>cough</em>)<br>
Also mentioned above, Large NPCs do not stand on top of eachother and do not have “Connected bodies” as I call them</p>
<p>NPCs also have a combat system very similar to the regular Player vs Player combat system. This makes high leveled NPCs very challenging and just makes fighting an NPC feel right.</p>
<p>Small tidbit of information, I became very bored while making rock-crabs and made them spawn like how they do in Runescape <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Boss Monsters</p>
<p>I decided to re-do all Boss NPCs because I deemed them too easy. It is almost impossible to solo some of these bosses and this is how I want it. The following NPCs are considered “Boss” NPCs and are recommended to be hunted with a team :</p>
<p>Chaos Element - 100%<br>
The Chaos Elemental has 4 different attacks, doesn’t hit 0 if you are using mage protect(halves the damage)<br>
Melee attack(1):<br>
1.The Chaos Elemental does one melee attack if you are close to him, a<br>
body ram.</p>
<p>Mage attack(3):</p>
<ol>
<li>A regular attack with a projectile.</li>
<li>An attack that removes a random piece of equipment.</li>
<li>An attack that eletricutes you, which makes you stop combat.(Instead of bullshit annoying teleporting)</li>
</ol>
<p>King Black Dragon - 100%<br>
The king black dragon has 6 different attacks.<br>
It is very highly advised to use an anti-dragon shield or dragon fire shield (Fully charged) along with magic protect and an anti-fire potion if your going to melee, an anti-fire potion, and constantly use magic protect if you choose to use a ranging weapon.</p>
<p>Melee attack(2):</p>
<ol>
<li>The king black dragon can attack you with his claws, hitting less than a headbutt.</li>
<li>The king black dragon can do a very powerful headbutt.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mage attack(4):</p>
<ol>
<li>The first attack, is his fire breath. This attack allows the king black to potentially deal extra damage.</li>
<li>The second attack of the king black dragon, is a poisonous breath.</li>
<li>The third attack of the king black dragon, It’s Ice breath, has the potential to deal moderate damage while freezing you in place</li>
<li>The fourth attack, is a stat-lowering breath.</li>
</ol>
<p>Kalphite Queen - 100%<br>
The kalphite queen is a special boss, as it has the potential to attack everybody around her at once. The Kalphite queen is the strongest boss, as it deals high amounts of damage to everybody close to her in one attack. The kalphite queen has 1 magic attack, 1 ranging attack, and 2 melee attacks.</p>
<p>Melee(2):</p>
<ol>
<li>The kalphite queen can bite a single person, with venomous teeth.</li>
<li>The kalphite queen can kick a single person, thus it’s weakest attack with no effects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Range(1);</p>
<ol>
<li>The kalphite queen ranging attack fling’s spike’s at everybody near the kalphite queen, causing massive damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Magic(1):</p>
<ol>
<li>The kalphite queen has a very unique magic spell, which hits one player, causing a chain reaction and forces the spell to hit the next player and so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Daggonath Kings - 100%<br>
The dagannoth king’s are fairly special, as there is three of them, and little bitches in the water. There is one king that uses range attacks, one king that uses magic attacks, and one king that melee attacks.</p>
<p>Magic attack(1):</p>
<ol>
<li>The dagannoth supreme uses a magic attack, that is very powerful.</li>
</ol>
<p>Range attack():</p>
<ol>
<li>The dagannoth prime uses a ranging attack, shooting a spike from its back at you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Melee attack(1):</p>
<ol>
<li>The dagannoth rex uses a poisonous claw to strike.</li>

<p>Our Veiw’s</p>
<p>First of all, as a Joined Project, Hoodlom and i have had to come together to create in what we think is the ultimate in RuneScape Private servers today, by Content, Strategy, Attention to detail, and appealing to what players want. we have written up some goals we want to acheive in creating this server for all not an Adventure Server for one half of RSPS or just a PK Server for one half, but a perfect mix for all.</p>
<p>Create A Stable Server<br>
This means to create a server that wont disconnect every Hour on an Auto Restarter. and Wont go down randomly for hours at a time. A server that Says “24/7” because it actually means it.</p>
<p>To create a game free for all<br>
No matter how big this game gets, or how popular it may grow, i will assure you all that Dynasty will always be a Fully free to play game, i am not in this for profit, i am in this to finally create a server real people want and real people want to play, and a price should not be put on that.</p>
<p>High Quality Gameplay<br>
This is another one, I HATE and i mean HATE seeing a server advertised with Teleports in the emote tabs, or ::help commands or even help guides in the Quest Tab. Servers with no creativity.<br>
I always strive to create High Quality Game Play and wouldnt release a server without it, im not going to rename a prayer, or a weapon or npc, make things look cheap by re coloring Items, I will have a Real new prayer, never seen before, a Sprite i made myself from nothing, or a Newly designed weapon (probably with the help of Galkon =]) that has never been seen before with its own special and ability, None of this may be special, but it is just another thing i strive to do, is not always focus on the big features, but make the little things nice as it holds a server together.</p>
<p>The Best. No Questions.<br>
Now when this is said, people assume that they mean “The best server ever seen” no. that’s not what i mean, this server is simply a type of server never been made in my opinion, but one that is always looked for. it is a High Quality Pk Server. Just like pures on RuneScape, main type of Pures, Strength pure, Range Pure, Barrows Pure, Zerker Pure, Main types of servers, Adventure Servers, Pk Servers, Now generally Adventure servers are very high quality, with alot of realistic features, and generally, Pk Servers are fast, buggy, glitched up and arn’t stable, the opposite of the Adventure Server, now i hope this server will be the middle. a Pk Server, but that isn’t terribly low quality, with realistic features, stability, isn’t instant levels. The perfect middle, between the two major types. That satisfy all needs.</p>
<p>Special Thanks</p>

        <p>No pictures as of yet to prove, but its Jonny J, with the succesful JSRevolution I &amp; II, this will be a huge threat to most if not ALL private servers. As soon AS or if I get to test ‘Dynasty’ I will bring many pictures and videos. As of now though you will have to rely on Jonny J &amp; Hoodlom.</p>

        <p>Lol, it was Jonny’s post to the blog, just wanted people to really know the effort put into this server, basically I just wanted you to read combat and duel arena updates, I tested the duel arena on JSReborn, and he made it from scratch no more copy and paste bs. Like when you duel you see the obstacles will appear every time… none of that mess in there. Thanks though!</p>

        <p>Thank You, I was able to test JSReborn BETA, with Jonny J. It was utterly amazing for a private server. This isnt a 508,525 its actually a 317, but the timing and dedication that he put into JSReborn alone was amazing. Now mixed together with Project Dayz. Ahh I cant wait to get some pictures ;D</p>
