    <description>Hey guys, im the owner of a new server called Reborn Reality, the server is good, but has some basic things i want to change/add to the server but i only know the basics of coding. I need someone good to take control and code in what he thinks is beset for server and also what i ask, i can already code in basic stuff like items stats, prices, shops ect... so i need someone who can make me a new dungeon with re-spawning monsters and more misc stuff.

The server is a 562 (i think) and it has working Soul Split, turmoil, Ovl, Spec Restore, and much, much more. I am also working on a VPS but not sure what to get. Thank you for ur time - Reborn Reality
