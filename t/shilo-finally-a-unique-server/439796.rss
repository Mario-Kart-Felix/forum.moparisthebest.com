    <title>SHILO - Finally, a unique server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shilo-finally-a-unique-server/439796</link>
    <description>[size=18pt][b]NOTE:[/b][/size] I&#39;m the guy behind this project, so if a mod could remove the other thread (which was made at my request, I just decided to make it myself now) that would be fantastico. :)

[B]Base:[/B] RuneFusion, but I can&#39;t remember the version... Oops. I haven&#39;t done any testing with a lot of people on this base so I&#39;m going by word of mouth that it&#39;ll work hahaha

[B][COLOR=red]PLEASE go register at the forums! It would mean the world to me if you joined, and even more if you were active &lt;3

[COLOR=YellowGreen][size=36pt][B]Shilo Development Thread[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
Hey there guys! This is the project thread for Shilo. I&#39;ve had one of these going before (over a year ago), but that died out. This one won&#39;t... And I&#39;m sure of that because THIS time I actually developed a lot of the server before I started going public about it ;)

Shilo is going to be a unique server. But I&#39;m actually being serious, I&#39;m not just saying that to gain supporters and members and then throwing up a leech of some source in the Downloads section with updated graphics and a bunch of buggy sh!t that just flat out sucks. This server is based in Shilo Village, and branches out into the rest of Karamja, as well as underground and over seas to other islands. Chances are you won&#39;t see a bit of the usual RuneScape world.

By spawning some NPCs and objects (nothing big or annoying), I&#39;ve managed to create a few custom areas/caves/etc., and by using items (that I&#39;ve made quest items) to access boss lairs and other awesome places. This is legit. Enough with the text, though.

[b]tl;dr[/b] - 317 source and very lightly edited client (no cache edits), based on Shilo Village with many unique and custom places. You won&#39;t be disappointed.

[SIZE=24pt]The Idea[/SIZE]
The idea behind this server is simple: to create a server with unique locations and solid gameplay, and to build a strong community. The vision I&#39;ve had with using Shilo Village as the home area is to keep everything relatively confined to just the areas that are developed in the game, so no matter where you are you&#39;re always interacting with a few people. I&#39;ve always felt that the more interaction there is amongst players, the stronger the community and the more successful the server is. Along with this, I&#39;ve envisioned the server to have an incredibly stable economy, where basically everything but basic tools are created by the players or, in uncommon circumstances, dropped by monsters. Also, I&#39;ve wanted the training to not be TOO difficult, but definitely a challenge when it comes to being the best.

[SIZE=24pt]Content[/SIZE]

I don&#39;t want to go through and put percentages for the completion for skills and stuff because half the time they aren&#39;t even updated and don&#39;t really reflect how finished things actually are. So, I&#39;ll just describe the stuff I&#39;ve added.


[ul][*][I]Mining / Smithing[/I]
I&#39;ve got a full mining system and a full smelting system. Smithing is being worked on and should be done soon.
[*][I]Woodcutting / Fletching[/I]
Both woodcutting and fletching are working really well. Trees and more bows need to be added - Very easy.
[*][I]Firemaking[/I]
Firemaking is completed, minus ashes dropping but I&#39;m still deciding on that.
[*][I]Fishing / Cooking[/I]
Fishing and cooking are both basically finished, just need to add a few more fishing spots and add burning.
[*][I]Runecrafting[/I]
Runecrafting is working swimmingly, a few more altars just need to be placed.
[*][I]Combat[/I]
[list]
[*]Player vs. NPC - Melee, range, and magic are all working well. A few small kinks to be worked out but overall pretty solid.
[*]Player vs. Player - Haven&#39;t done too much with this but as far as I can tell it&#39;s working pretty well. Still need to add a few things.
[/list]
[*][I]Prayer[/I]
Burying bones and prayer draining is working well, I just need to add a few more prayers in.[/ul]


Along with skills, custom areas and object/NPC spawns are being mapped and added currently. Quests are going to come a bit later.



Thanks for reading! Please post here to show your support, PLEASE go visit the forums and register, follow the Twitter, etc. It&#39;d mean the world to me &lt;3 Thank you guys! I can&#39;t wait for this to be finished and I hope you share the same feelings :)</description>

<p>[COLOR=YellowGreen][size=36pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Shilo Development Thread</span>[/SIZE][/COLOR]<br>
Hey there guys! This is the project thread for Shilo. I’ve had one of these going before (over a year ago), but that died out. This one won’t… And I’m sure of that because THIS time I actually developed a lot of the server before I started going public about it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Shilo is going to be a unique server. But I’m actually being serious, I’m not just saying that to gain supporters and members and then throwing up a leech of some source in the Downloads section with updated graphics and a bunch of buggy sh!t that just flat out sucks. This server is based in Shilo Village, and branches out into the rest of Karamja, as well as underground and over seas to other islands. Chances are you won’t see a bit of the usual RuneScape world.</p>
<p>By spawning some NPCs and objects (nothing big or annoying), I’ve managed to create a few custom areas/caves/etc., and by using items (that I’ve made quest items) to access boss lairs and other awesome places. This is legit. Enough with the text, though.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr</span> - 317 source and very lightly edited client (no cache edits), based on Shilo Village with many unique and custom places. You won’t be disappointed.</p>

<p>[SIZE=24pt]The Idea[/SIZE]<br>
The idea behind this server is simple: to create a server with unique locations and solid gameplay, and to build a strong community. The vision I’ve had with using Shilo Village as the home area is to keep everything relatively confined to just the areas that are developed in the game, so no matter where you are you’re always interacting with a few people. I’ve always felt that the more interaction there is amongst players, the stronger the community and the more successful the server is. Along with this, I’ve envisioned the server to have an incredibly stable economy, where basically everything but basic tools are created by the players or, in uncommon circumstances, dropped by monsters. Also, I’ve wanted the training to not be TOO difficult, but definitely a challenge when it comes to being the best.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">MORE MEDIA TO COME</span></p>
<p>[SIZE=24pt]Content[/SIZE]</p>
<p>I don’t want to go through and put percentages for the completion for skills and stuff because half the time they aren’t even updated and don’t really reflect how finished things actually are. So, I’ll just describe the stuff I’ve added.</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]<span class="bbcode-i">Mining / Smithing</span><br>
I’ve got a full mining system and a full smelting system. Smithing is being worked on and should be done soon.<br>
[</em>]<span class="bbcode-i">Woodcutting / Fletching</span><br>
Both woodcutting and fletching are working really well. Trees and more bows need to be added - Very easy.<br>
[<em>]<span class="bbcode-i">Firemaking</span><br>
Firemaking is completed, minus ashes dropping but I’m still deciding on that.<br>
[</em>]<span class="bbcode-i">Fishing / Cooking</span><br>
Fishing and cooking are both basically finished, just need to add a few more fishing spots and add burning.<br>
[<em>]<span class="bbcode-i">Runecrafting</span><br>
Runecrafting is working swimmingly, a few more altars just need to be placed.<br>
[</em>]<span class="bbcode-i">Combat</span><br>
[list]<br>
[<em>]Player vs. NPC - Melee, range, and magic are all working well. A few small kinks to be worked out but overall pretty solid.<br>
[</em>]Player vs. Player - Haven’t done too much with this but as far as I can tell it’s working pretty well. Still need to add a few things.<br>
[/list]<br>
[*]<span class="bbcode-i">Prayer</span><br>
Burying bones and prayer draining is working well, I just need to add a few more prayers in.[/ul]</p>
<p>Along with skills, custom areas and object/NPC spawns are being mapped and added currently. Quests are going to come a bit later.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! Please post here to show your support, PLEASE go visit the forums and register, follow the Twitter, etc. It’d mean the world to me &lt;3 Thank you guys! I can’t wait for this to be finished and I hope you share the same feelings <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
