    <description>Hi there,

[b]Please do not spam this topic, I would like this to remain mature and devoted to development. Thank you! :)[/b]

Similar to what Pesterd began, I am looking to work on a year 2002 RSC NPCLoc+NPCDef XML project. I do not expect contributions by Moparscapians to the project and fully expect 100% leeching to take place.

I am working on my next server which is titled Mendax (Latin for lier) which is going to be a clone of how Runescape Classic was in the year 2002. I will be painstakingly going through each entry, removing any and all NPCs/items which I do not remember existing in 2002. That includes things like scythes, king black dragons, members stuff, ect. This also will include drop tables with item drop weight. Most likely it will have to be an educated guess on what weights should be assigned, based on item value.

Many of you who are here are into this for nostalgia reasons and I&#39;m sure there are a few old school RSC players out there like myself who miss the way Runescape was before Jagex began largely changing the overall game dynamics.

I think a good idea would be to run a SourceForge SVN or CVS site for the hosting of this. As RSC development begins to stagnate, any development in the direction of the original game that is released for the good of all developers seems to me as positive direction which many can appreciate. One reason for this topic is also to provide a place for general questions I may have that others may be able to answer, such as &quot;KBD came after 2002, right?&quot;


I do indeed have two RSC accounts which I have maintained for all these years to investigate, however, I do not think they will be needed as I feel the RS wiki has all the needed information, and playing free RS2 is similar enough. My photographic memory can fill in the blanks hopefully. I want to avoid paying Jagex for members if at all possible. Once I have the SourceForge information, I will post it here.

[b]Anyone interested in joining this project, please add me to MSN messenger and we can discuss this in more detail. Webmaster@DARScape.org[/b]


I&#39;ve gone through ItemWieldable.xml and removed all items that came after 25 december 2002.

<p>With DARScape I focused on quality customer support (something I was forced to learn with a tech help desk job at my old college) and it really did pay off in making DARScape a fun and mature place to be. I don’t think players would have wanted to donate as much as they have if I had not taken that approach and coached the other staff members on acting the same way. Going on four months that I have been running on the dedicated server. Had I not had it, Mendax would never have been able to be produced and DARScape would have died after the first DDoS attack. (If I had still been hosting it off my residential connection)</p>

              <p>The problem here is that sleeping bags and fatigue did not exist in 2002. They came much later. While the goal is to try to stop bots, there must be other ways which are not as intrusive.</p>
<p>The way I have worked to reduce the number of autoers in DARScape has been to simply state this: if an admin or player mod approaches a player and after trying to talk to them and getting no responce, kicks them, and they log back in and resume without talking, then it is clear that they are autoing. In this case, we jail them and their player sits in jail for the rest of it’s existence. You can’t catch all of them, but by saying that if they do it and are caught, they will be punished. AFKing isn’t so useful if you come back and find your player disconnected. Because of this policy, I have yet to catch a single autoer. Employ enough responsible player mods, and autoers and AFKers find its not worth doing it. Try to put in new methods into the server to combat it and instead they will find new ways to defeat detection.</p>

<p>If you’re going to use the sleeping bag method, there’s nothing stopping people elaborating on the cases and introducing cases for other things too, not just matching the colours with the correct name.</p>

<p>Just run Some PERL scripts and have it check all Archived RSC Databases and have it dumped into a spread sheet.<br>
That is what was done for the RSC Development Project that I released late December. The link is in my Signature, you should check it out.</p>
<p>If there are any problems understanding what all of it is, then feel free to post in the topic or PM me.</p>

              <p>darscape, I remember I checked up on the item bonuses on that site before, and compared them with in-game of RSC. When I did that, they were not correct, since they never removed the default of 1 in all of the bonuses. I don’t think they cared to re-check them fully, since they were not going to use them for anything else than as a guide. That is what I remember, but I can aswell remember it all wrongly… You do better check against in-game of RSC aswell, or dump them from the client if possible?</p>
