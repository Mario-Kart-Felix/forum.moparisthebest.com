    <description>[b][i]Hi everyone, my name is Michael. I&#39;m from australia and have a full time job during week days, other then that i spend most of my time fiddling with source and clients but never actually host, but during my spare time i get abit bored with just doing that so im looking to join a dev team. the only potiential problem that i can see happening and may occur is timezones, ive been trying to teach myself how to code for about 2 months and really wanna learn more, im willing to put in as much effort as i possibly can. if you think you could help me out by letting me help you out as much as possible that would be great.
