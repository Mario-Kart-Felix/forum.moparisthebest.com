    <title>[637/639] Summoning invalid Familiar please report to admin</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/637-639-summoning-invalid-familiar-please-report-to-admin/525350</link>
    <description>I tried to follow this help thread: https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,595296.0/nowap.html
But the links mod zyle posted were invalid for npcdefinitions, and it seems that he ended up helping him through PM.

Basically the problem is when you try to summon a familiar it just says &quot;invalid Familiar please report to admin&quot;.
I used around 3 other sources to try and fix the problem but they all ended up having the same thing... So i&#39;m assuming it might be an issue with demethium. If anyone fixed this before can you post how you did it?</description>
