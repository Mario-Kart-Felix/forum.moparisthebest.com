    <description>Im starting over so im throwing away the source i was working on, I don&#39;t want to work off of someones already premade source but a nice clean one. I would used Cleaned v4, but the client.java is wierd looking. Any suggestions for a good source that would also give me a learning experience. I know the basics of coding.</description>
