    <description>Before you start embarrasing your self Frell oked for me to post it here.
What does this have to do with models? All of the added stuff in the project is made out of models. The trees.. the land.. the weapons and so on.
made a working client!

Right now the client only sends and receives text. but soon it will be able to do much more. also it saves acc&#39;s and loads them.

Well a couple months ago i was experimenting on the blender 3d model maker and discovered that there is a game engine on it. So i started a little project of my own. Cryptic reign. it is a 1st person action adventure game under development atm. but i will be displaying all of the progress i have made here.
[What i have so far]
A pritty flawless walking system
A almost perfect weapon switching action
A pickup system
A working door system that acually brings you inside of thee houses
[What i am working on]
a way to make mqo files to .blend files.
Npc&#39;s
attacking system
More playing area!
Armatures [bone structures for the npc&#39;s]
and alot more....

Here is a old video of the project.

And a newer video of the project.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5x5OQebNPA

The maps get loaded once you get to the end of the path.
One thing i do need is a pritty good story line.[but that can come later]
and if any one could help me with armatures that would be very help full to.
I am the only worker on this project atm.</description>

<p>its definately non-related to rs.</p>
<p>on topic: i like it. there are tutorials on water animation though, cuz the slightly rotated plane just isnt workin for me. OR you can always add a moving texture to the plane.</p>
<p>Armatures are fun to mess with. and about your converting mqo to blender format, its actually pretty easy, you save the .mqo as a .3DS(or LWO) and import it in blender. you’ll need to scale it up ofcourse. if you need help with anythin id be willing to help with modelling in this project.</p>
