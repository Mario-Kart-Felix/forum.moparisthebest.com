    <title>Too many players = disconnection for players?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/too-many-players-disconnection-for-players/190319</link>
    <description>Hello fellow moparscape users,

When my server gets more then say 15 people, it sometimes disconnects some players, and on the moparscape client, at the bottom it says &quot;error - (players name) too many players.

I think my server needs an update, which will handle more players.

Anyone got any tuts, or any spare coding lying around which will help me?
