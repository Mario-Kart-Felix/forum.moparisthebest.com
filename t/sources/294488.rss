<p>Or, in psychoshot case, he might no understand whats happening, but he understands how to follow it…</p>

<p>Man seriously… I say you shouldn’t code at all… Sorry but that’s the truth…  You say your good with computers and all but you can’t follow a simple guide… Your talk is like that you are frustrated to see all those folders. Now that you got a source and without even editing and you host it. It will be like you just leeched… SO NO POINT AT ALL. STOP CODING NOW. THE FURTHER YOU GET THE HARDER IT WILL BE!</p>

<p>I should suggest that you should give respect to other moparscape members, like he said, coding doesn’t comes to one over night… So try stepping of your high horse “Bud” and try helping for once… Im probably sure that your not a wiz at coding… If you where, you would be helpful.</p>

              <p>Ok, im not the best coder, bit shit compared to other people.</p>
<p>Ok, to answer your first question,</p>
<p>The code you see is written in Java, you can add anything and take away anything from it, just make sure you don’t screw up any of the main methods, like the run method (The run method is how a player connects to the server)</p>
<p>Second question,</p>
<p>Your server is already coded, thats how you are able to walk in-game, attack mobs, do quest, trade etc…</p>
<p>Also, what VERSION of the server are you using? 317 - easiest to code, it’s the old runescape with bad graphics (Not classic)</p>
<p>503+ New HD textures and graphics.</p>
<p>Try and tell me type of server your using (Or give me the server name and ill tell you) and ill help you to code it.</p>

              <p>See im really good with computers and stuff, but i wanna learn and to learn you gotta ask and i read some stuff but i just dont completely get the concept and all i want is someone to help me understand. I’m not asking someone to help me code or something just the idea.</p>
<p>We all started learning from scratch…You think programmers woke up one morning knowing how script, no not at all they all started researching and learning at one point. Which leads to my i think simple question but everyone is make it ten times harder.</p>
<p>I have a client downloaded and i have a source downloaded. I was told you have to code the source, but when you look at the files within folders of the source you can open it in notepad and it has code, Question 1 do i have to add code is just the begning basis/maybe the format its supposed to be.</p>
<p>Then i was told that i have to learn how to code which i understand it’d be helpful but if all the files in the source are already scripted what? do i have to learn to code so i end having to code the source into the client?</p>
<p>I think thats simple enough to answer.</p>

              <p>Ok, look… Go to the download’s section…</p>
<p>-Download a source you like.<br>
-When downloaded unrar (or whatever).<br>
-Get a client on wich you can change your ip.<br>
-Get your ip.</p>
<p>Now you want to do some editing.</p>
<p>-You can look at tutorial which are extremely easy.<br>
-Then by following the specs on tutorials you can make a npc, shop, etc…<br>
-You can google “Coding guide for beginners”<br>
-When your done editing. Compile.<br>
-If you compiler says you do not have JDK 5.0 or 6.0.<br>
-Edit your compiler and replace it by your version of JDK.<br>
-If you don’t have JDK properly installed it won’t work.<br>
-There are some tutorials on MoparScape that tell you how to make a server.</p>
<p>Hope I helped!</p>

              <p>Can you just clarify this for me, Is this is a server or a client and which version it is. I infer its a 508 but please confirm this.<br>
You cannot really mix and match files from one server/client to another.</p>
<p>This belongs in Server Help then.</p>
