    <description>Hey guys,

Lately theres been all sorts of sources released and i havn&#39;t been up to date with them all.

[Question] What is Winterlovers source and what are it&#39;s features.

I would just like to know what decent sources there are around now. That doesn&#39;t mean that guys source from over there. I would like names of some well-known source to start my new server.

All help is appreciated.

Thanx :)</description>

              <p>Winterlove is pretty basic and has barely any features. Really just walking, pickuping/dropping items (although this is easily hackable and only you can see them) and some basic equipping/inventory/banking.</p>
<p>If you were starting from scratch, I would choose Stork’s rs2d (<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,227037.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,227037.0.html</a>). It’s a better base than Winterlove and can handle many more players. However, none of the tutorials here will be able to help you use that source because it is so different to the others.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a source more like the ones used at the moment, I would probably choose WhiteScape. It’s nice and clean like Winterlove’s source, but has a few more features and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Many people here would probably recommend Devolution v7. Although it can handle a large amount of players (hundreds) I would not recommend it. If you use it you will have to get rid of many of the Dodian features not to be called a leecher. I think the combat in it isn’t great, although I haven’t tested it much.</p>
