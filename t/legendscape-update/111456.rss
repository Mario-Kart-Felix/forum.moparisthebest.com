    <description>	LegendScape as you know has been down due to incompatibility issues. We are happy to say that the Administration Team has sent the hard drive to the team at FireDogs to recover and work on backing up the systems. Yesterday the staff of LegendScape was informed that FireDog has repaired the incompatibility issue and has backed up the databases. This all means that the server may be back up and running by the end of today.
	In another update LegendScape Corporation is undergoing a business deal in which should bring in a minimum of $80,000. This profit will be used to increase business power as well as the systems.

              <p>[quote=“Frell, post:2, topic:111456”]why do you try to sound smart… we all know your a 8 year old behind a computer screen.[/quote] I don’t like proving people incompetent but damn you sure make it a hard thing not to do. For an 8 year old kid I could sure as hell show your fat ass off any time any place ever heard the expression “No haters here” well I have a saying of my very own when people like you start talking their ineffectual little words . . . <img src="http://img507.imageshack.us/img507/1397/ma8cbb5a081453e50d1224bve6.jpg" alt width="" height="">.[QUOTE] Dumb ass you’ve been owned.[/QUOTE] So sit your ass down Shut that sad excuse for a mouth up, stop hating and start working toward helping people instead of insulting them. Hey anyone can insult but it takes real skill and a real person to give helpful/wise feed back.</p>
<p>So think about that next time you insult others. Because hey someday you will be the one on the other end . . . and you aint going to like it very much an you’ll be wishing you had some helpful feed back rather then some low shit talk which does nothing but tear you down.</p>
