    <description>Hey guys, I recently downloaded a Delta cleaned client to learn a lot of the basics of Java and RSPS so alot of you may think that i&#39;m really stupid asking this.
The first thing i&#39;m trying to do is add the commands string so i put this

[code=java]	private void customCommand(String command) {

}[/code]

And added this command inside it

[code=java]if(command.startsWith(&quot;mypos&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 0){
sM(&quot;AbsX: &quot;+absX+&quot; AbsY: &quot;+absY+&quot;&quot;);
}[/code]

But when i do the command, nothing happens although it shows up in the server Cmd prompt that i typed it in as a command. I&#39;m pretty sure that i have to declare what customcommand does somewhere but i&#39;m not to sure where.</description>
