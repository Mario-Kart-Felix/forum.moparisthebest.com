    <title>Smart npc help? what is this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/smart-npc-help-what-is-this/349929</link>
    <description>alright, I have this file in my server, that I never messed with until day.. called smartNPC.cfg alright?
I was wondering what exactly it does, like, what the difference is between this, and regular NPCspawn.cfg
if you don&#39;t know what the file I will show mine and tell me i can help :)

[code][END]

[FORMAT EXAMPLE]
spawn(tab)=(tab)ID(tab)X(tab)Y(tab)H(tab)INTELLIGENCE(tab)HITPOINTS(tab)ATTACK(tab)STRENGTH(tab)DEFENCE(tab)RANGED(tab)MAGIC
[/code]

I followed the format, and when I started the source, it gave me this big long error about loadNPC.. I don&#39;t wanna post it because I have my server running right now and people will get mad &gt;.&lt;
I need help :)
this isn&#39;t a rush, I just wanna know what the whole INTELLIGENCE is about, and why there is the HIPPOINTS/ATTACK/STRENGTH/DEFENSE/RANGED/MAGIC thing in there when that is in the NPClist.cfg, and how to make it not give an error.</description>

              <p>In your case, the intelligence basically means that the NPC can either block your attacks, poison u, mage u, or drain stats, prayer stats ONLY, if its set to the server.</p>
<p>I had this b4. very easy. and the range, defence, etc. set that to 1 and his defence will either:<br>
Block very little<br>
drain your stat (defence)<br>
if he attacks u, ur defence level goes to 1</p>
<p>BUT!!<br>
these effects only happen if set in the server.</p>
