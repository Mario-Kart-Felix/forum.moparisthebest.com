    <title>Help with Java3D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-java3d/441857</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been given a coursework assignment that I&#39;ve left a little bit late, and I&#39;m wondering if I can get some help from here on a few, probably simple, problems. 

Firstly, I&#39;m having real problems trying to texture anything, even primitive shapes. I am not sure how to geometric texture map, and always seem to have trouble loading the texture jpg from the src directory. This is how I&#39;m trying to load and set the texture. 

[code]private Texture createTexture() {
		    String filename = &quot;\\src\\images\\wall.jpg&quot;;
		    
		    // Load the texture
		    TextureLoader loader = new TextureLoader(filename, null);
		    ImageComponent2D image = loader.getImage();
		    
		    Texture2D texture = new Texture2D(Texture.BASE_LEVEL, Texture.RGBA,
		    	    image.getWidth(), image.getHeight());
		    	    texture.setEnable(true);
		    	    texture.setImage(0, image);
		    	    texture.setMagFilter(Texture.BASE_LEVEL_LINEAR);
		    	    texture.setMinFilter(Texture.BASE_LEVEL_LINEAR);
					return texture;
		  }[/code]

Here&#39;s mostly a copy and pasta from a previous attempt to load a box with the texture:

[code]Appearance wallApp = new Appearance();
		wallApp.setTexture(createTexture());
		TextureAttributes texAttr = new TextureAttributes();
		texAttr.setTextureMode(TextureAttributes.MODULATE);
		wallApp.setTextureAttributes(texAttr);
		wallApp.setMaterial(new Material(white, black, white, black, 100.0f));

             Box wall = new Box(.4f, .4f, .4f, wallApp);
	
	    
	    // Map the texture coordinate
	    TexCoord2f[] texCoords = new TexCoord2f[24];
	    for (int i = 0; i &lt; texCoords.length; i += 4) {
	      texCoords[i] = new TexCoord2f(0.0f, 0.0f);
	      texCoords[i + 1] = new TexCoord2f(0.0f, 1.0f);
	      texCoords[i + 2] = new TexCoord2f(1.0f, 1.0f);
	      texCoords[i + 3] = new TexCoord2f(1.0f, 0.0f);
	    }

	    QuadArray quadArray=(QuadArray)wall.getGeometry();
	    quadArray.setTextureCoordinates(0, 0, texCoords);[/code]

So yeah, I&#39;m truly bad at Java3D and I&#39;m struggling with my assignment. Any chance of a few nudges in the right direction? 

Primitive.GENERATE_NORMALS + Primitive.GENERATE_TEXTURE_COORDS seem to help

Edit - When dealing with textures I am currently putting there completely path in &quot;C:\\Docs and Settingsz\\Chris...ect amd I can&#39;t seem to find a way so the textures will load just using &quot;wallTexture.jpg&quot;. All the images files are in the src folder. Any ideas?</description>

<p>Aha, I’m glad you found out your problem. That mapping issue is very strange. It’s almost as if TexCoord2f takes values relative to the dimension of the texture (which is wrong by the OpenGL standard, anyway). Very strange indeed.</p>

              <p>Sorry I’m a bit late, but are you getting any actual errors when trying to load the texture? Unless I’m mistaken, windows is going to have a trouble resolving your path, because it’s technically not relative (it needs a dot in the front of it). Otherwise, although your text coord generation seems a bit whacky (there’s no way to ensure you’re doing proper alignment), there’s nothing inherently wrong with the way you’re setting up the texture and primitives. If you are positive you’re drawing your scene properly, there’s no reason it shouldn’t show up. If you aren’t having a loading problem, what exactly is showing up in your scene? Could you maybe post some of your scene handling code?</p>
<p>Hope I’m not answering this too late.</p>
