    <description>I was looking through lists of npcs, and npcanimations.. and I found dragons..and dragon animations.. I noticed that my source does not have the correct animations for dragons, only the King Black Dragon.. I was wondering what file you edit, to set NPCanimations.. I looked in all the reasonable places for them to be, but I found nothing.. can someone please tell me?? is it in one of the CFG files, or a .java, and where?</description>
