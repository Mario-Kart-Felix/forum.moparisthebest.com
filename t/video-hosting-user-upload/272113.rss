    <title>Video Hosting (user upload)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/video-hosting-user-upload/272113</link>
    <description>I was wanting to make a small video hosting section on my site, but I&#39;m not entirely sure how to approach it. For one, i don&#39;t really know how the whole process goes other than after a user uploads a video file, the file goes through a server/converter and thereafter added to the site. Although I&#39;ve never done this before, it doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t figure it out. I&#39;ve come across a few things while looking all of it up, but I haven&#39;t gotten the idea of how to set it all up yet.

I&#39;m hoping someone will give me a little help and guide me in the right direction with this. So any information such as hosting sites, downloads, etc., would help a lot.

Edit:
Does anyone think this is a good way to go? - http://www.cirtexhosting.com/ffmpeg-hosting.shtml</description>
