        <p>FROM: Mrs Grace Owen</p>
<p>Dearest in Christ,</p>
<p>My name is Mrs Grace Owen a nationality of Kuwait. I am married to late MR. KYRIAN OWEN who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year October 2003. We were married for twenty years with a child. He died after illness that lasted for four days.</p>
<p>Before his death we were both born again Christians. When my late husband was alive we deposited the sum of $4.5 Million (Four Million five hundred Thousand U.S.Dollars) with one of good banks here in Cote d’Ivoire presently, this money is still with the bank.</p>
<p>Recently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to my cancer problem, though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a person or church that will use this fund to churches, orphanages, research centres and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.</p>
<p>The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I have a child that will inherit this money but my son can not carryout this work only because I and my late husband decide to use some of the money to work for God and live some for our son to have a better live. Our son is just 17yearold now and been grow up in Africa, he has low maturity and my husband’s relatives are not Christians and I don’t want my family hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers, I don’t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.</p>
<p>Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death Hence I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace.</p>
<p>I want your telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my family relatives around me always. I don’t want any of my husband family relatives to receive this money.</p>
<p>With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance house. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the new beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I live a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth, Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose.</p>
<p>Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated here and Please I will like you to contact me Immediately you receive this mail so that I will instruct the Bank to transfer this fund into your account for me and my Son to start coming over there because since two days now we are having a very big problem in Abidjan here the REBELS Went into the military camp and killed so many military so we need this transaction very urgent so that I and my Son KELVIN will joined you there after the bank transferred this fund into your account and I pray by the Grace of God I will not die and will see the end of this transaction.</p>
<p>Remain bless and I hope to hear from you soonest.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely.</p>

<pre><code>( "REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS
 CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE")
</code></pre>
<p>Compliment Of The Season,</p>
<p>On a very good day. I am (SOLOMON TOURE) a senior<br>
staff in file department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your<br>
contact from a Yahoo Tourist Search.</p>
<p>When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of<br>
your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when<br>
i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (friday december 26,2003  ) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death,</p>
<p>we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as<br>
indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the<br>
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.</p>
<p>The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be<br>
transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for<br>
;me and my woman colleague. There after I and my colleague will visit<br>
your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.</p>
<p>Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as<br>
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account<br>
number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt<br>
of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the<br>
application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.</p>
<p>You should contact me on my number 00226 78 82 97 88…immediately as soon<br>
as you receive this letter. reply me with this e mail address <a href="mailto:solomon_toure@latinmail.com">solomon_toure@latinmail.com</a>. immediately</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>SOLOMON TOURE</p>
<p>POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to<br>
enable the<br>
transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will<br>
prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me<br>
immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.Please call me and inform me that you received my mail, because i don’t go to net always.</p>
<p>Beloved In Christ,</p>
<p>I am Ms Sharma Taylor, Secret Wife and Personal Assistant to former<br>
Liberian Rebel Leader Charles Taylor now standing trial for war crime. In this capacity, we committed alot of crimes and atrocities against humanity and God.Although, am now a Christian convert in my new base in London, but diagnosed of terminal disease. I believe God and I know that I will not die, but will live to declare the glory of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ is my only comforter having lost the beauty of life through the death of my only daughter in the Liberian War.I diverted the sum of Eighteen million, five hundred thousand US Dollars ($18.5Mi). The fund is presently deposited in a finance company in Europe for security reasons and all the documents concerning the fund are in the custody of my<br>
lawyer.</p>
<p>I have prayed concerning this donation for God’s guidance and if in<br>
your heart you genuinely and faithfully desire to use this fund for the<br>
propagation of God’s work in any form whether for charity, ministry,<br>
evangelical mission or otherwise for the benefit of humanity and glory of God, do get in touch with me for possible communication with my lawyer on how you will receive my donation.note my alternetive email address please:(<a href="mailto:sharmataylor3@yahoo.fr">sharmataylor3@yahoo.fr</a>)</p>
<p>God bless you and as you receive give God the glory.</p>
<p>Ms Sharma Taylor.</p>
