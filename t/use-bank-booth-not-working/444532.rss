    <title>&quot;Use Bank Booth&quot; not working?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/use-bank-booth-not-working/444532</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

I searched around for a while and am still stuck.
I&#39;m back to 317 programming. More like back to Java programming in general... So please just go easy on me  ;)
It&#39;s a very very clean DeltaScape source by Tatemo.

Resolved!!!

I had to add this block of code under the Packet for Object First Click which was case 132:

[code]			if ((objectID == 2213)) {
				skillX = objectX;
				skillY = objectY;
				WanneBank = 1;
			}[/code]</description>
