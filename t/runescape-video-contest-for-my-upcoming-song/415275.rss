    <description>[center][b][size=24pt]RuneScape Video Competition: Featuring My New Song[/size][/b][/center]

Hello fellow moparscape users. It has come to my attention that runescape has quite a unique orchestration within their &quot;theme song&quot;. Realizing this, I decided to remake the song into something a little more electronic... And good...

So, I decided, considering I am a veteran of a Runescape based community, that I want to hold a competition for this song.

[b]I DON&#39;T KNOW THE REWARD YET[/b], but I&#39;ll make it up as I go.

The contest is as follows:

[center][b][size=18pt][u]Description[/u][/size][/b][/center]

[center]Moparscape members competing in the competition will be creating a fan made video of their main focuses on Runescape. Combat, Cash, and Monsters must be a [i]high[/i] on the priority checklist. The video will be made to fit with my new song (undetermined title). Yes, it will be an RS music video, and yes it will be extremely nerdy. However, I&#39;ve always wanted to see this community compete to show their personalities in their work.[/center]

[center][b][size=18pt]How To Enter?[/size][/b][/center]
Make a video coinciding with the following clip below. The contestant with the best made video clip to go along with my sound clip below will win.

Clip of the project:
http://soundcloud.com/cookiedoughcody/runescape-clip

very similar to the 2011 &quot;theme song&quot; of RS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5SVQo1RkFA

Have Fun! I&#39;ll be glad to answer any questions and concerns pertaining to the video.</description>

hahaha that shit made me laugh.</p>
<p>On a serious note knowing i love dubstep, it’s pretty good.<br>
DON’T INVOLVE RUNESCAPE WITH DUBSTEP.<br>
Please.</p>
