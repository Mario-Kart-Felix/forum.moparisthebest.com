    <title>Big problem that needs to be fixed quick (command) (bringing up a window in game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/big-problem-that-needs-to-be-fixed-quick-command-bringing-up-a-window-in-game/236371</link>
    <description>Ok people say it&#39;s my source it&#39;s not... I tried another source it doesn&#39;t work... So don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s my server unless you got proof and you can fix it...

Ok this is what&#39;s up.. Whenever I do the ::bank command OR open up a shop manually it will d/c and then log me back in... This needs to be fixed... Also as i&#39;ve seen in freescapepkz when you change you&#39;re character in the ::char command and log out and back in it would of saved you&#39;re character.. As of my server that does not happen.. So if someone could give me a solution to these.

If it&#39;s command issues and It&#39;s coded wrong please post below a little tut with you&#39;re code and how to add it and how many parts etc... Please help me quick with this I can&#39;t release my server possibly source (would be a great one) 

Thanks SO MUCH,

Check my sig :)</description>
