&lt;blockquote&gt;Fabrice Muamba &#39;critical&#39; after collapse in Spurs-Bolton match

Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba is critically ill after collapsing during an FA Cup quarter-final tie against Tottenham.

The 23-year-old is being treated in the intensive care unit of the heart attack centre at the London Chest Hospital.

Muamba is said to be showing &quot;real fight&quot; in his battle for life.

Medics spent six minutes trying to resuscitate him on the field after he fell to the ground with no other players around him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
