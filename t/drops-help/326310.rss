    <title>Drops help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/drops-help/326310</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, I&#39;m making a server and I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to make drops only need one click to pick them up. At the moment, it takes 2-4 clicks to pick up one thing and it&#39;s kind of annoying. ha ha

If there is already a tutorial on this or some place this is answered please link me to it, I tried searching for a tutorial, but couldn&#39;t seem to find one.

EDIT: The server is 317 based if that matters. I know there is a way to do it on 317, but like I said, I just can&#39;t seem to find out how.

Thank you ahead of time!!</description>
