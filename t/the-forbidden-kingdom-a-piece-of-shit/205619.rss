    <title>The Forbidden Kingdom. A piece of shit</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-forbidden-kingdom-a-piece-of-shit/205619</link>
    <description>EDIT: WARNING! WHEN WATCHING THE MOVIE YOU MAY FEEL LIKE YOU GOT RICK ROLL&#39;D
I watched the movie, waiting to see and epic movie with Jackie Chan and Jet Li, but fuck, was I disappointed. Anyways, the commercials put it out to be a funny action movie. But no. The main character was a honkey. It wasn&#39;t funny (not just in my opinion, they didn&#39;t try to make it funny, many of the things advertised in commercials wasn&#39;t funny when you saw it.)
The action, was questionable, it was just simple attacks and blocks, and the occasional exxageration (like people jumping really high, or being thrown through rocks.

The plot, i would give it a 7/10 because it was a decent idea, but the solution to the problem was just 1 to 2. Nothing special inbetween.

SPOILER BELOW

[size=5pt]Baisically. There was a honkey, who loved watching chinks do karate. He gets thrown off a building and then he appears in the middle of Chinkmania. Where he meets Jackie Chan, an old, drunk poet who kicks ass. Jackie sees he has a staff (which a warlord wants, so he can rule Chinkmania) and they go to a restaurant, the honkey gives money, which happens to be fake and the guards, who were supposed to be looking for the staff were alerted. Jackie pwnt them, they meet a girl named sparrow who also pwns. They meet Jet Li along the way, who tried to assasinate them. They became niggas, I don&#39;t know, it just happened I didn&#39;t read the subtitles. They wanted want to pwn the warlord, but Jackie got shot by an arrow, who a bitch who wanted an elixer for immortality (which was in posesstion of the warlord, and offered it as a reward to whoever brings him the staff). The honkey, wanted to save Jackie so he gave the staff, but the warlord was gonna kill him, so Jet Li, and sparrow came to help him, the honkey took the elixer and gave it to Jackie. They pwnt everyone there. Then the Jade Emporer who was in power before, came back, cuz the honkey stabbed a statue or sumthing (again, subtitles).[/size]</description>
