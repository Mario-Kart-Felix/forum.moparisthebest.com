    <title>Quick post, Regarding (DeviousMUD)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quick-post-regarding-deviousmud/224945</link>
    <description>No really sure where to even post this, Since its pre-RSC development. Not sure if any of you guys will remember deviousMUD but was curious, if anybody has a working download for it maybe???? For those who dont know what deviousMUD is, It was what RSC was based off. Was released in 1998.
