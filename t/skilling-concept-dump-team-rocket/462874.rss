    <title>Skilling Concept Dump - Team_Rocket</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/skilling-concept-dump-team-rocket/462874</link>
    <description>We haven&#39;t done anything in a while for the community, so here&#39;s this. These are simply ideas which have been derived from the original content.


&lt;blockquote&gt;Skilling: Skilling is usually not a good way to become rich on a server.Skills will have their own Costumes! You will be able to wear to
gain more resources from the skill. They will also increase Experience gained and how quickly you are able to Skill. 
All Skills also have misc. items that increase Experience gained in the skill that can be purchased via Skill points
(based on the skill). For example, you can speak to the Mining Master with the Skillcape to bring up the Skill Exchange 
for mining. When you mine or perform ANY Skill, you gain Skill Points for that skill. This is the currency for the Skill
Exchanges. There will be 3 types of reward collums on the Exchange interface. The first will be 6 assorted costume, 
armor ranging from Iron to Dragon, and everything in between. The Costumes will make you a better Skiller of course.
The second collum will contain 6 high level skill items. The third will contain 6 random prizes such as a pet. ALL
of the Collum prizes refresh, meaning every hour, all of the current items in the collums will be replaced with
completely new items.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thieiving: Thieiving is usually the same boring thing, you get the level, and you move on to a new N.P.C. which gives
you a miniscule amount of Coins. You are now able to thieve from any N.P.C. at level 1, It&#39;s no longer based on level.
Instead, you are told the chance of success you have to pickpocket the N.P.C. based on several factors, including 
your Thieiving level, equipment worn (certain pieces of equipment such as Rogue sets increase success rates), and
more. The higher the level the N.P.C. is, the greater chance of higher loot rewards you recieve. You must be a certain
level to be able to have a chance to pickpocket certain things. For example, you must reach level 70 Thieiving before
you have a chance to be able to thieve Gilded armor. There will be perks and certain items that are very useful for this
skill, like there are and will be for all of the other skills. For instance, at level 55, you may obtain Flash Powder
via the Thieving Skill Exchange (accessed by speaking with the Skillcape Master of the Skill). This Flash Powder can
be bought with Thieiving Points, Coins, ect. The purpose of the Flash Powder, is, when you are caught pickpocketing
from a N.P.C. you are stunned for longer than usual, this is to help balance out the Time V.S. Reward factors. Flash
Powder can be used to escape the stun completely, and be ready to pickpocket again as soon as you use the Powder. 
However, you will soon run out of Flash Powder, as they are deleted upon use. Eventually all N.P.C. except for Bosses 
and Mini-Bosses will be able to be pickpocketed. Skillcape Masters will also have the Pickpocket option. When the
player is caught - the Skillcape Masters will retaliate with an attack according to their Skillcape mastery. 
For instance: a player caught pickpocketing the Attack Skillcape Master, he will launch
a boulder at the player, knocking the player back 5 spaces and doing damage. The Firemaking Skillcape Master will
use Firemaking against you. He lights a player where the player is standing when caught, if there is already an
existing fire where the player is standing, another one will not be lit. The lit fire does damage to the player until
it de-spawns to ashes. Rare items will also be able to be stolen. The level required is 95, and the Skill&#39;s Experience
rate is x2 RuneScape&#39;s rate. The chance of receiving a Rare item from Thieiving is equal to the chance of receiving 
a 3rd Age item on RuneScape. You can unlock the Rogue equipment set that increases your chance to thieve successfully 
with each piece unlocked by playing the Rogue Den Minigame.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mining: People think of the Mining skill on a R.S.P.S. as a useless Skill and feature. This will no longer be the case.
Players will be able to Mine Runite ore at level 1. At level 85, players will be able to mine &quot;Extreme Crafting Ore&quot;.
This Ore can be used in virtually all Skills that require materials to make items. It can be substituted once every
hour to replace ANY ingredient required to make something. For example, crafting a Robin Hood hat. If a player has
all of the materials to Craft one except they&#39;re missing an ingredient, they will be prompted with the substitution
option. The Ore does not require a Mining level to use, therefore it is invaluable to all players. This Ore will be
VERY hard to obtain, and will always be in demand. At level 99 Mining, a Player gains the &quot;Ore-Master&quot; perk. This
will enable players to open a new option with the Mining Skillcape Master. This new option will allow players with
99 Mining to change the way they Mine. With this option toggled, the player will no longer recieve Ore from Mining,
they will recieve Bars already smelted from the Mining rock. This option will cost noted Ore to be toggled on/off. The
amount of Ore required will be based on the player&#39;s total Mining experience. The more Mining experience they have
in the Skill, the less noted Ore is required to toggle the option. At over 75,000,000 Mining experiece, the toggle 
will be free. ALSO: Dragon Ore, Bars and Smithing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Farming Minigame: The Fairy Cure.  Players may speak with the &quot;Farming Fairy&quot; once they have completed the Quest, A Fairy Tale Pt. 1, they will have unlocked the magical
secataurs and be able to participate in the Fairy Cure Minigame. Once they speak with the fairy, players are qued for the Minigame. Whilst waiting, the player may do
any-other activity as long as it doesn&#39;t effect their que (such as joining another minigame or instancing). Once 10 players are qued, they are all sent the option to join
in the minigame. The 10 players are then assigned seeds and all the other materials they will need to begin, the basics are discussed, and then the game begins. The main
objective of the minigame is to excell in at least one department of Farming. If you farm the most trees, then you will be recognized as having done this and be rewarded
accordingly. The same goes for varying situational wins, such as the player who has the least amount of diseased crops. In this minigame there are no winners or losers, 
everyone is awarded based on how hard they work and what they accomplish at their own pace. 


Farming: The Royal Family of Cynosure thanks you for your
contribution to the land by sending you Coins via Mailbox each time you gain a level...
 10,000 for  levels 1-20, 20,000 for levels 20-40. 
25,000 for levels 40-60, 30,000 for levels 60-70. 
50,000 for levels 70-80. 75,000 for levels 80-90, 
and 1,000,000 coins for levels 90-99. 
The Gold will be in the player&#39;s mailbox. The Royal Family plays a key role
in the story. Which will be revealed in time. Mailboxes can be found outside of majorly
populated areas such as banks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Runecrafting: You can craft all runes at level 1. Lava Runes at level 25 which give a +5% Spell Accuracy effect. 
Steam Runes at level 40 - increases Spell Damage by 5 percent. Mud Runes at level 60 gives an extra 2 second freeze
when an Ancient Magick spell that has a freezing effect is cast. Ability to make Mud Staves at level 75.
Full Runecrafting outfit can be unlocked via Minigame.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fishing: Players start out fishing Lobsters at level 1 Fishing. At level 99 Fishing, the player&#39;s catches are noted in their inventory. If the player has both 99 Fishing and Cooking, then the fish are caught noted and cooked. Monkfish at level 40, Sharks at level 65, Manta Rays at 80, Sea Turtles at 90, and Golden Sharks at 99. Golden sharks 
heal 3 points more than Sea Turtles. The QUest &quot;Fishing Contest&quot; must be completed before you can enter the Fishing Guild. There is also a Minigame that is unlocked after
completing the Quest. Fishing spots will change based on how many fish are caught from them and how long they&#39;ve been in that spot. If a player is suspected of botting, 
a whirlpool will appear where they are fishing at and suck them in - forcing them to go through an underwater puzzle with factorization. Fishing Costume cannot
be equipped until level 85, and each piece gives you an additional catch each time something is caught. Meaning if you unlocked all 6 pieces from the Minigame, then you&#39;d 
instantly catch 7 fish everytime 1 is caught.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Slayer: Money mailed to the player once their Slayer task is completed, it takes into account how many enemies were slain, and the difficulty level of the Task you accepted.
Epic tasks are Bosses only.

Easy tasks - 1,000 Coins per enemy slain
Medium tasks - 2,000 Coins per enemy slain
Hard tasks - 3,000 Coins per enemy slain
Epic tasks - 50,000 Coins per enemy slain&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Archeology: Artifacts can be found and dug up throughout the Land of Cynosure. Equipment that falls under the Artifact Tier 
requires a level in Archeology to be worn. The dig spots respawn every 8 hours, and there will be many; randomly
generated each day. You can learn to identify statues and such and learn their value. This skill will earn players around
300m once they reach 99. They can also enter a minigame where they must survive for as long as they can whilst digging up 
treasures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Skinning: Some Monsters, Mini-Bosses, and Bosses will have the option to be skinned, if you have the level then you can skin
them. For example, you can skin a Rat, Giant Rat, and Kree - the Armadyl Godwars Dungeon Boss. The amount and quality of the
Skin recieved will depend on the statistics of the N.P.C. killed. The person who kills it will have the option to skin it. If 
they don&#39;t, then after 1 minute it becomes Skinnable by everyone. These skins can be used to craft any type of Dragonhide
by having thread in your inventory and using a Needle on the Skin. This includes Dragonhide (g) Trimmed if you have the appropriate
level.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>Sure, if that’s how you want it to be. You just have to factor in the pros and cons to doing it like this. Here’s a few:</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easier and more casual for players</li>
<li>No need for an object refresh on trees</li>
<li>No need for an object Health system for trees</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some players might see this as inferior</li>
<li>A lot of modern servers have this now</li>
<li>You won’t have a Health system for trees, which can be used for any other object</li>
<li>Easier for script writers to exploit</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you have to factor in how this affects the economy, if at all. How this has an effect on other Skills that are linked and merged with Woodcutting, etc.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>We haven’t done anything in a while for the community, so here’s this. These are simply ideas which have been derived from the original content.</p>
<blockquote>Skilling: Skilling is usually not a good way to become rich on a server.Skills will have their own Costumes! You will be able to wear to
gain more resources from the skill. They will also increase Experience gained and how quickly you are able to Skill. 
All Skills also have misc. items that increase Experience gained in the skill that can be purchased via Skill points
(based on the skill). For example, you can speak to the Mining Master with the Skillcape to bring up the Skill Exchange 
for mining. When you mine or perform ANY Skill, you gain Skill Points for that skill. This is the currency for the Skill
Exchanges. There will be 3 types of reward collums on the Exchange interface. The first will be 6 assorted costume, 
armor ranging from Iron to Dragon, and everything in between. The Costumes will make you a better Skiller of course.
The second collum will contain 6 high level skill items. The third will contain 6 random prizes such as a pet. ALL
of the Collum prizes refresh, meaning every hour, all of the current items in the collums will be replaced with
completely new items.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Thieiving: Thieiving is usually the same boring thing, you get the level, and you move on to a new N.P.C. which gives
you a miniscule amount of Coins. You are now able to thieve from any N.P.C. at level 1, It's no longer based on level.
Instead, you are told the chance of success you have to pickpocket the N.P.C. based on several factors, including 
your Thieiving level, equipment worn (certain pieces of equipment such as Rogue sets increase success rates), and
more. The higher the level the N.P.C. is, the greater chance of higher loot rewards you recieve. You must be a certain
level to be able to have a chance to pickpocket certain things. For example, you must reach level 70 Thieiving before
you have a chance to be able to thieve Gilded armor. There will be perks and certain items that are very useful for this
skill, like there are and will be for all of the other skills. For instance, at level 55, you may obtain Flash Powder
via the Thieving Skill Exchange (accessed by speaking with the Skillcape Master of the Skill). This Flash Powder can
be bought with Thieiving Points, Coins, ect. The purpose of the Flash Powder, is, when you are caught pickpocketing
from a N.P.C. you are stunned for longer than usual, this is to help balance out the Time V.S. Reward factors. Flash
Powder can be used to escape the stun completely, and be ready to pickpocket again as soon as you use the Powder. 
However, you will soon run out of Flash Powder, as they are deleted upon use. Eventually all N.P.C. except for Bosses 
and Mini-Bosses will be able to be pickpocketed. Skillcape Masters will also have the Pickpocket option. When the
player is caught - the Skillcape Masters will retaliate with an attack according to their Skillcape mastery. 
For instance: a player caught pickpocketing the Attack Skillcape Master, he will launch
a boulder at the player, knocking the player back 5 spaces and doing damage. The Firemaking Skillcape Master will
use Firemaking against you. He lights a player where the player is standing when caught, if there is already an
existing fire where the player is standing, another one will not be lit. The lit fire does damage to the player until
it de-spawns to ashes. Rare items will also be able to be stolen. The level required is 95, and the Skill's Experience
rate is x2 RuneScape's rate. The chance of receiving a Rare item from Thieiving is equal to the chance of receiving 
a 3rd Age item on RuneScape. You can unlock the Rogue equipment set that increases your chance to thieve successfully 
with each piece unlocked by playing the Rogue Den Minigame.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Mining: People think of the Mining skill on a R.S.P.S. as a useless Skill and feature. This will no longer be the case.
Players will be able to Mine Runite ore at level 1. At level 85, players will be able to mine "Extreme Crafting Ore".
This Ore can be used in virtually all Skills that require materials to make items. It can be substituted once every
hour to replace ANY ingredient required to make something. For example, crafting a Robin Hood hat. If a player has
all of the materials to Craft one except they're missing an ingredient, they will be prompted with the substitution
option. The Ore does not require a Mining level to use, therefore it is invaluable to all players. This Ore will be
VERY hard to obtain, and will always be in demand. At level 99 Mining, a Player gains the "Ore-Master" perk. This
will enable players to open a new option with the Mining Skillcape Master. This new option will allow players with
99 Mining to change the way they Mine. With this option toggled, the player will no longer recieve Ore from Mining,
they will recieve Bars already smelted from the Mining rock. This option will cost noted Ore to be toggled on/off. The
amount of Ore required will be based on the player's total Mining experience. The more Mining experience they have
in the Skill, the less noted Ore is required to toggle the option. At over 75,000,000 Mining experiece, the toggle 
will be free. ALSO: Dragon Ore, Bars and Smithing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Farming Minigame: The Fairy Cure.  Players may speak with the "Farming Fairy" once they have completed the Quest, A Fairy Tale Pt. 1, they will have unlocked the magical
secataurs and be able to participate in the Fairy Cure Minigame. Once they speak with the fairy, players are qued for the Minigame. Whilst waiting, the player may do
any-other activity as long as it doesn't effect their que (such as joining another minigame or instancing). Once 10 players are qued, they are all sent the option to join
in the minigame. The 10 players are then assigned seeds and all the other materials they will need to begin, the basics are discussed, and then the game begins. The main
objective of the minigame is to excell in at least one department of Farming. If you farm the most trees, then you will be recognized as having done this and be rewarded
accordingly. The same goes for varying situational wins, such as the player who has the least amount of diseased crops. In this minigame there are no winners or losers, 
everyone is awarded based on how hard they work and what they accomplish at their own pace. 
<p>Farming: The Royal Family of Cynosure thanks you for your<br>
contribution to the land by sending you Coins via Mailbox each time you gain a level…<br>
10,000 for  levels 1-20, 20,000 for levels 20-40.<br>
25,000 for levels 40-60, 30,000 for levels 60-70.<br>
50,000 for levels 70-80. 75,000 for levels 80-90,<br>
and 1,000,000 coins for levels 90-99.<br>
The Gold will be in the player’s mailbox. The Royal Family plays a key role<br>
in the story. Which will be revealed in time. Mailboxes can be found outside of majorly<br>
populated areas such as banks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Runecrafting: You can craft all runes at level 1. Lava Runes at level 25 which give a +5% Spell Accuracy effect. 
Steam Runes at level 40 - increases Spell Damage by 5 percent. Mud Runes at level 60 gives an extra 2 second freeze
when an Ancient Magick spell that has a freezing effect is cast. Ability to make Mud Staves at level 75.
Full Runecrafting outfit can be unlocked via Minigame.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Fishing: Players start out fishing Lobsters at level 1 Fishing. At level 99 Fishing, the player's catches are noted in their inventory. If the player has both 99 Fishing and Cooking, then the fish are caught noted and cooked. Monkfish at level 40, Sharks at level 65, Manta Rays at 80, Sea Turtles at 90, and Golden Sharks at 99. Golden sharks 
heal 3 points more than Sea Turtles. The QUest "Fishing Contest" must be completed before you can enter the Fishing Guild. There is also a Minigame that is unlocked after
completing the Quest. Fishing spots will change based on how many fish are caught from them and how long they've been in that spot. If a player is suspected of botting, 
a whirlpool will appear where they are fishing at and suck them in - forcing them to go through an underwater puzzle with factorization. Fishing Costume cannot
be equipped until level 85, and each piece gives you an additional catch each time something is caught. Meaning if you unlocked all 6 pieces from the Minigame, then you'd 
instantly catch 7 fish everytime 1 is caught.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Slayer: Money mailed to the player once their Slayer task is completed, it takes into account how many enemies were slain, and the difficulty level of the Task you accepted.
Epic tasks are Bosses only.
<p>Easy tasks - 1,000 Coins per enemy slain<br>
Medium tasks - 2,000 Coins per enemy slain<br>
Hard tasks - 3,000 Coins per enemy slain<br>
Epic tasks - 50,000 Coins per enemy slain</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Archeology: Artifacts can be found and dug up throughout the Land of Cynosure. Equipment that falls under the Artifact Tier 
requires a level in Archeology to be worn. The dig spots respawn every 8 hours, and there will be many; randomly
generated each day. You can learn to identify statues and such and learn their value. This skill will earn players around
300m once they reach 99. They can also enter a minigame where they must survive for as long as they can whilst digging up 
treasures.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Skinning: Some Monsters, Mini-Bosses, and Bosses will have the option to be skinned, if you have the level then you can skin
them. For example, you can skin a Rat, Giant Rat, and Kree - the Armadyl Godwars Dungeon Boss. The amount and quality of the
Skin recieved will depend on the statistics of the N.P.C. killed. The person who kills it will have the option to skin it. If 
they don't, then after 1 minute it becomes Skinnable by everyone. These skins can be used to craft any type of Dragonhide
by having thread in your inventory and using a Needle on the Skin. This includes Dragonhide (g) Trimmed if you have the appropriate
level.</blockquote>
