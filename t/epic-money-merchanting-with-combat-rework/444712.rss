    <description>[code]Changes to Special Attacks 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 
Special attacks are being removed from all weapons as part of the combat update. In their place we are introducing new abilities for you to unlock and use from your shiny new action-bar. 

Dragon Claws and the Armadyl Godsword 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 
No you cant use a AGS spec with claws. Claws are a pain currently, yes they are two-handed items, but in the new system we consider them &quot;small&quot; weapons so they cant use the AGS ability. 

The 4 Godswords will all be effectively the same in the new system, they will have the same stats as each other, so the only difference between them will be cosmetic. 


As part of the combat update, every piece of armor and weaponry in the game is having its stats re-worked, so that current powerful weapons like the Godswords make up for the loss of their special attack by having bad-ass stats. 

Also, two-handed weapons don&#39;t suck the big one in the new combat system. 

In regards to trying to bust out a dragon claws special with a maul, the new abilities have certain weapon requirements on them. For example, the dragon claws special is now known as the ability &quot;Flurry&quot;, and cannot be performed with two-handed swords/mauls etc. 

Big beefy 2h weapons get their own set of abilities to use, like the Armadyl Godsword special, which can&#39;t be performed with smaller weapons, like claws. 
[/code]


DO U REALISE YOU SHOULD GO AND BUY LIKE 50000 BGS and wait till they rework and sell them for like epic profit..
i just thought of that cuz all the godswords will haf the same stats and stuff btw this is not my quote it was written by sum1 else i read</description>

<p>Also, two-handed weapons don’t suck the big one in the new combat system.</p>
<p>In regards to trying to bust out a dragon claws special with a maul, the new abilities have certain weapon requirements on them. For example, the dragon claws special is now known as the ability “Flurry”, and cannot be performed with two-handed swords/mauls etc.</p>
<p>Big beefy 2h weapons get their own set of abilities to use, like the Armadyl Godsword special, which can’t be performed with smaller weapons, like claws.<br>
