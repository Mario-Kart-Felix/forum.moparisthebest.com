    <title>[PI] Player Timer persisting on logout?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-player-timer-persisting-on-logout/441643</link>
    <description>Ok for my vote4Cash System, after say the user claims their reward have this setup.

[code]						c.VoteTimer = System.currentTimeMillis() + 86400000;[/code]

What that does is it sets a timer before the user is able to use the command ::claim again, and it does work real well except for the fact the timer unfortunately still resets after they logout. I was thinking I could make it save a variable when they logout and have the timer continue on login, but that is not what I want. I want a 24 hour timer regardless if they are online or offline.

You may refer to my previous thread about what some of it looks like.

<p>Actually, woulden’t making a player token along the lines of “votetime” set to the long of the current system time, and when the player goes to claim again it checks if votetime + 86400000 then they can claim again (right here is where it’ll set the long Day-Waited to the current system time that they claimed again. And thus a much easier system.</p>
<p>If the above was not legible, it was because I was trying to get the idea down before I forgot it, but how it would work is. By default the player token Day-Waited would be 0 so I can properly check if they’ve voted before and properly allow you to claim the first time only. It then sets Day-Waited to the current system time. next time they claim, if it’s not 0 it checks if votetime + 86400000 then allowing the player to claim the reward and setting the current system time as the votetime token, and so on.</p>
<p>Please tell me if this idea sounds like it’d work, it sounds far more easier then the dates personally.</p>
