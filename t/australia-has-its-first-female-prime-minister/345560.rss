    <title>Australia has it&#39;s first female Prime Minister</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/australia-has-its-first-female-prime-minister/345560</link>
    <description>As of this morning, Julia Gillard is the Prime Minister of Australia. The Labor Party pretty much told Kevin Rudd to pack his bags and fuck off.
Noteworthy is that she wasn&#39;t actually elected by the Australian people, but she&#39;s technically the first none-the-less.

&lt;blockquote&gt;PRIME Minister-elect Julia Gillard has paid tribute to outgoing PM Kevin Rudd and spelled out plans for the immediate future in her first speech at the helm of Australia.

Ms Gillard, who came to office in 1998, started by saying she was “truly honoured to lead this country which I love”.

She said she believed a “good government” was losing its way, stating she took her fair share of responsibility for the Rudd government’s record ... “for its achievements and its errors”.

Ms Gillard said the government’s proposed super mining tax and the introduction of carbon prices would now be reviewed.

She said she would call an election “in the coming months” and between now and then would seek the support of Australian voters.

Ms Gillard also paid tribute to Mr Rudd, saying he was “a man of remarkable achievements and he made a wonderful history for this nation”.

She also praised the work of new deputy Wayne Swan, calling him an “outstanding treasurer (who) I know will become an outstanding deputy prime minister”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>The mining companies were paying less tax than other companies because of the massive deductions, combined with the fact that they’re coming to our country and taking our resources, it’s only fair really. We have a debt we need to pay off. The last budget was also done after taking into account the mining tax.</p>
<p>Also, speed cameras are state revenue not federal.</p>

<p>Senator Stephen Conroy was talking about a mandatory ‘code of conduct’ for the ISP industry after iiNet beat AFACT in court earlier in the year. That code of conduct was decidedly in favour of the music/movie industries. So it’s not like our government isn’t prepared to get down on its knees and swallow for at least one industry out there – even if doing so is not in the interest of this country’s citizens.</p>
<p>[quote=“Original Daniel, post:11, topic:345560”]Basically what happened was that the mining tax was a good idea, but rudd did it wrong. He kept changing his stance from ‘they come to our country and make money off our resources so lets take some’ to ‘well it will barely affect their bottom line’ and others. They are both true, but he didn’t sell it to the public very well.</p>
<p>The mining companies (who pay less tax than everyone else anyway because of mining deductions) had a massive ad campaign against it, and that combined with his terrible way of selling it lead to him losing in the polls. He then decided to launch his own ad campaign, which pissed off the public even more because of tax dollars used. His party then went behind his back and he stepped down before they took a vote because he knew he would lose.</p>
<p>They were also probably still pissed off about the printing allowance thing.[/quote]<br>
There’s no need to increase the taxes in my opinion. We already have things like speed cameras for revenue raising.</p>

No, we elected Kevin Rudd. They had a caucus meeting which was meant to have a vote for the new Labor leader, but Rudd stepped down knowing that he was going to get his arse kicked.</p>

<p>Is this because, like the UK, you don’t elect people but parties?</p>

              <p>As of this morning, Julia Gillard is the Prime Minister of Australia. The Labor Party pretty much told Kevin Rudd to pack his bags and fuck off.<br>
Noteworthy is that she wasn’t actually elected by the Australian people, but she’s technically the first none-the-less.</p>
<blockquote>PRIME Minister-elect Julia Gillard has paid tribute to outgoing PM Kevin Rudd and spelled out plans for the immediate future in her first speech at the helm of Australia.
<p>Ms Gillard, who came to office in 1998, started by saying she was “truly honoured to lead this country which I love”.</p>
<p>She said she believed a “good government” was losing its way, stating she took her fair share of responsibility for the Rudd government’s record … “for its achievements and its errors”.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard said the government’s proposed super mining tax and the introduction of carbon prices would now be reviewed.</p>
<p>She said she would call an election “in the coming months” and between now and then would seek the support of Australian voters.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard also paid tribute to Mr Rudd, saying he was “a man of remarkable achievements and he made a wonderful history for this nation”.</p>
<p>She also praised the work of new deputy Wayne Swan, calling him an “outstanding treasurer (who) I know will become an outstanding deputy prime minister”.</p>
