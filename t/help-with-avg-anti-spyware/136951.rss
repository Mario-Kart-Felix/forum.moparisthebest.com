    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-avg-anti-spyware/136951</link>
    <description>Well, I just got AVG Anti-Spyware today and I did a full scan on my computer. I got some trojans and viruses after the scan was complete, now... how do I delete or fix the problems?? What do I click on? Ignore once or Save Report?  

Please post ASAP!</description>
