    <description>Hello all! I first came about private servers only about a month ago, and ever since then i have been intruiged by them. The whole concept of running Runescape on MY Computer, wow. Bizzare. I would really like to learn how to code java, i have done Pascal and server scripting, very little vb, i know enough html to make a decent website, and some ccs! java seems to me like a whole new territory. so if anyone has msn would you please add and help me out, i need person to person in order to understand it lol, someone i can rely on when i have a question. My msn is Derickisbad123@msn.com Thanks all!</description>

              <p>It’s nice to see a new <span class="bbcode-b">DETERMINED</span> coder in this community, why not visit the java coding conventions? Or perhaps look at tutorials to learn. Tutorials are basicly what tought me how to code, of course I tought myself a lot. With practice and determinination anyone could be a good coder.</p>

              <p>Well, it would be best to find out things for yourself.<br>
There are many tutorials out there that help people learning Java.</p>
<p>And I know, you may not want to learn it that way.<br>
But there are other ways!</p>
<p>I never followed any real java tutorial.<br>
The downsides is that my vocabulary in Java is not at par with my coding.</p>
<p>I’ve downloaded sources and took in how everything works.<br>
My best bet to you is to perhaps look at sources.<br>
If you really are hoping to learn, you should be able to do some cool things in about a week.</p>
