<p>That’s a paradox ain’t it. People who know the truth are told the truth so that they know the truth. Obama kept exposing Romney about the misrepresentation of the polices that were set forth by himself and his administration? Common man. I’m not a cold hearted democrat but you could have presented a bit more juxtaposition to give some clarity and make me not think you’re purely bias.</p>

<p>Lol. No. You were listening to liberal media outlets and now that you’ve heard the unbiased direct plans of both presidents in the same room criticizing eachother you won’t admit that you only want Obama because he’s Obama.  Romney is playing up the campaign like its supposed to be, Obama has holes everywhere and is inexperienced.</p>
<p>No, sinisoul, when Obama was explaining his plan he also explained Romneys plan, but he constantly said something incorrect about it to make it sound more extreme than it was, for example, Romney said his tax plan would not add to the deficit, but even after Romney corrected Obama twice he once again called it a 5trillion dollar tax plan, and Romney had to correct him a 3rd time.</p>

<p>I’m heavily bias against both candidates, both are fucking retards.</p>
<p>You don’t repeat the exact same point 3 times without any more arguments, when your opponent have explained to you why you are wrong. It seems to be a consensus that Romney won this, so we would just  need to wait for the next debate.</p>

Romney is a flip flopper. He makes you think hes a good candidate. Wait until another debate/ speech from him on the social issues. He is going to lose it.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Lol. No. You were listening to liberal media outlets and now that you’ve heard the unbiased direct plans of both presidents in the same room criticizing eachother you won’t admit that you only want Obama because he’s Obama.  Romney is playing up the campaign like its supposed to be, Obama has holes everywhere and is inexperienced.</p>
<p>No, sinisoul, when Obama was explaining his plan he also explained Romneys plan, but he constantly said something incorrect about it to make it sound more extreme than it was, for example, Romney said his tax plan would not add to the deficit, but even after Romney corrected Obama twice he once again called it a 5trillion dollar tax plan, and Romney had to correct him a 3rd time.[/quote]<br>
It is a 5 trillion dollar plan over a cumulative period (8 - 10 years). Romney claimed his plan would not add to the deficit because he would cut spending elsewhere. What he didn’t say (but is proposed in his tax plan) is that the rate cuts would be paid for by the people in America making less than $200,000/yr (aka 95% of employed people in the US). People earning over a million dollars annually would see a net decrease of $80,000 to $125,000 while the other 95% would see a tax increase of $2,000. This is all summarized in a report by the Tax Policy Center.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/8/01 tax reform brown gale looney/01 tax reform brown gale looney.pdf" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/8/01%20tax%20reform%20brown%20gale%20looney/01%20tax%20reform%20brown%20gale%20looney.pdf</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">In this paper we examine the tradeoffs between rates, tax expenditures, and the progressivity of the tax schedules that are inherent in revenue-neutral tax returns. We show that plans that advance steeply lower marginal tax rate structures would require deep cuts in tax expenditures to offset the revenue losses arising from low rates. Because many of the largest tax expenditures benefit middle- and lower-income households, deep reductions tax expenditures can alter the distribution of the tax burden. To illustrate these tradeoffs, we examine as an example a set of tax rate reductions specified in Governor Romney’s tax plan. We show that given the proposed tax rates and proscription against reducing tax expenditures aimed at saving and investment, cutting tax expenditures will result in a net tax cut for high-income taxpayers and a net tax increase for lower- and/or middle-income taxpayers—even if individual income tax expenditures could be eliminated in a way designed to make the resulting tax system as progressive as possible.</span></p>
<p>This was only the first debate and obviously Obama’s hardest one because it concerns the US economy and job market. Neither Obama nor Romney respected the guidelines and protocols of the debate (ie - the first question was only supposed to be 15 minutes long, but ended up lasting 35 minutes long). Obama will have it a lot easier on the next debates because they will concern quite a lot of things Romney has absolutely no experience in. Foreign policy is a big part of US politics and Obama’s track record is pretty great so far (especially when compared to his predecessor). Romney will have a hard time discussing foreign policy without seeming like a complete novice. He will most likely play to the concerns of conservatives regarding Iranian nuclear ambitions. His only experience with the leadership in Israel is that he worked at the same company as Netanyahu, and the Jewish voters have consistently voted Democrats in the past few decades.</p>

What? Romney said his tax plan wont increase rates for everyone because it works with job growth. Cut taxes = more people working = more people spending = more revenue for the fed and lower tax rates for everyone.  Romney said countless times Obamas path is destroying the middle class, where Romney wants to solidify it and have it be the foundation, which I agree with. He also made alot of points that Obamas path will increase taxes for the middle class by $4k a year easily if it continues.  You don’t NEED to raise taxes for anyone so long as theres job growth. Obama wants to RAISE taxes for the rich to try and assist the lower class, which doesn’t fix the root of the problem that there needs to be MORE jobs. The goal is to have the least amount of people on government aid as possible (have them with jobs instead, not homeless lol), where Obama thinks being on government aid is completely normal and doesn’t want to try and help them out, only continue their benefit support.  I thought it was funny how Obama was bringing up extreme cases like “children with austism” and “elderly &amp; disabled” no fucking shit Romney is going to help them too, but Obama took it to himself to try and scare their vote from them. And again, Romney had to blatantly ask the announcer for more time to say “Look, there is NO risk to the current senior class or anyone near the senior class”</p>

… Really? Did you two even watch the debates?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Can you argue without invalidating someones opinion because you fail to analyze a deeper perspective of the argument you presented?[/quote]<br>
No, you’re still confused at what im saying. Im <em>not</em> talking about projections.  Obama was constantly making points that Romney only cared about the rich, and every time Romney had to go back and explain. He even said “No, im not going to cut taxes for the rich, im going to cut them for everyone. This isn’t some trickle down theory, no, im not going to do that.”</p>
<p>He quickly shot down the trickle down lie, and it got alot of attention everywhere: <a href="http://thehill.com/video/campaign/260147-aggressive-romney-blasts-obama-for-his-qtrickle-down-governmentq">http://thehill.com/video/campaign/260147-aggressive-romney-blasts-obama-for-his-qtrickle-down-governmentq</a>  you can tell by the comments on that article they watched the debate lol.</p>
<p>Obama started off pretty much every chance he got to speak by saying “Now, what I want to do is _____________. Governor Romneys plan is to [insert skewed bias here]”</p>
<p>And Romney kept having to ask the announcer if he can “Just comment on that real quick” so he could clear up the garbage Obama pushed towards him. Since Obama was getting the last word he was using it against Romney to try and reiterate what Romney said but overly skewed to sound like he doesn’t care.</p>
<p>My point is I had the same views as you because I tried to stay to stay away from listening to the news, but sadly sometimes at work CNN was playing. When im doing art I absorb every sound like a sponge.</p>
<p>I already knew I didn’t like Obama, but I was pretty sure I didn’t like Romney either. But he cleared up alot of the misconceptions I had.</p>
<p>I don’t care whatever else you heard anywhere else. They talked face to face last night and it was media-free and thats when I formed my opinion. You could tell a fuck load by the body language also. Romney became more and more confident while Obama started looking ‘lost’ without his teleprompter and then he crossed his legs.</p>
<p>You have to be blind to not see it. Romney overall is more fit to be a president. Even the liberal as hell Yahoo news says “Even on the most basic political points, Jeff Greenfield says, Obama seemed clueless.”</p>
<p>Sure, they both didn’t tell the whole truth the entire time, thats to be expected. Romney is still the lesser of the two evils.</p>

        <p>Tax cuts dont create jobs. They might some of the time, but demand is the real player. You need to fuel demand and what better way than having the entire population spending again.</p>
<p>We can’t trust corporations to use their savings on workers. Just look at the bail out, and how many bank ceo’s got a fat pay raise in the millions with tax payer money.</p>
<p>I watched the debate start to finish and it was pretty dissapointing. Romney was faker than ever, Obama didn’t have his pep and had poor responses. Both sides fail</p>

Cutting taxes does not equal more people working, I do not no where you got that idea.[/quote]<br>
When regulations and taxes are eased up on small businesses more jobs are created. When more jobs are created and taxes are cut for everyone people have more money. When people have more money they spend more. When people spend more theres higher consumer demand which fuels more jobs.</p>

He said it during the debate, and I don’t blame him. What Obama is doing right now to have that effect can only be temporary, it will crash and burn.  Obama is attempting to cut taxes and also bring in extra federal revenue, which isn’t going to happen in a nice way. Someone is going to pay and its going to come straight from the middle class.</p>
<ul>
<li>Im sorry Romney said their income has come down $4k a year, not taxes</li>
</ul>
<p>Hell, dumbo Biden is still ruining it for Obama. He admitted the middle class has been “buried” the past 4 years. I don’t care how many taxes you cut for them if their income is going down its null: <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57525057/biden-middle-class-buried-the-last-4-years/">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57525057/biden-middle-class-buried-the-last-4-years/</a></p>

Raising taxes is the worst thing you can do when theres no job growth.  So many businesses have settled into the bush tax cuts that if they end TONS of people will be laid off.  You’re right, there is no job growth when taxes are being raised on business, read my first reply.</p>

I know both of them didn’t tell the whole truth, thats to be expected. Here is where he replied to the 5T estimation: <a href="http://thehill.com/video/campaign/260147-aggressive-romney-blasts-obama-for-his-qtrickle-down-governmentq">http://thehill.com/video/campaign/260147-aggressive-romney-blasts-obama-for-his-qtrickle-down-governmentq</a></p>
<p>Yes, it is fiscally impossible because it relies on it spurring job growth. If job growth does not happen it will hit the deficit hard.  Obviously that is very blurry and theres only so much he can predict, the rest relies on us and businesses reacting to the cuts.</p>
<p>Though Romney is also planning to move alot of federal programs such as medicare and education BACK down to the state level where they can run more efficiently, which will free up alot of the federal budget to hold a tax cut.  Obama is pushing programs to the federal government that shouldn’t be there.</p>

That article was on Yahoo news also.  Im aware of Ryans fact issues, far worse than Romney or Obamas. Im interested to see how the debate goes down.</p>
<p>People don’t understand that hands-on government does not work as well as it does in theory. Clinton’s term was only successful because of the HUGE internet/cellphone boom that shook the world and created jobs EVERYWHERE. Not to mention he had a republican congress that pushed him to pass policies that freed up room for these new businesses to grow.  Bush’s policies were shadowed by the war, 9/11, war <span class="hashtag">#2</span>, Katrina, and the housing market collapse that leads back to Carter’s policies where the government intervened with people receiving loans. I can honestly say we wont ever know how the Bush terms would have went if it was uninterrupted.</p>
