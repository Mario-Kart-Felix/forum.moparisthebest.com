Still the unemployment rate is lower here than in United States (The same applies to Switzerland). The biggest issues for Norwegian companies is the falling value of the US dollar.</p>
<p>EDIT: The ratio between minimum wage and living costs are higher here than in US. So you get much more for a Norwegian minimum wage than an American minimum wage. However, the median wage in US gives more stuff than the Norwegian median wage.</p>
<p>So in America, the poor are poorer and the rich are richer.</p>

              <p>We’ve got decent wages. Minimum wage is $10.25 So in comparison, everything is more expensive than usa, but cheaper than norway and switzerland. Going shopping in the USA is awesome as a Canadian though.</p>
<p>Man I look back to being a kid, when gasoline was $0.50 a litre(now $1.30), all food was 2-4x cheaper. I remember my mom wouldnt buy lucky charms cereal because they cost $3, and when on sale she’d get some. Now cereal boxes are smaller and cost nearly $7. This is mostly normal since back than minimum wage was about 6$/hr, so low end wages have increased but it still doesnt match the price increases.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that $20/hr jobs remain $20/hr jobs - what used to be considered good is not good anymore, for the same job. (biased to my small town location where there is really only labour jobs)</p>

And this is why I think economics are flawed, it is more chaotic than a PRNG.</p>
<p>Norway and Switzerland has some of the highest wages in the world, but everything cost 1.6/1.7 times the cost in US (On average). So while the economy and wages increases, we doesn’t get anything back for it (Unless you buy stuff of the internet). Our government need to limit their spending to prevent the currency of getting too strong.</p>
<p>So the poor and the middle class in US are stuck in their situation, as their wages doesn’t increase compared to the price level.</p>

<p>Well,</p>
<p>Perhaps every penny must go towards job creation or wage increases (for lower wage workers but Im not going to say what is considered low)</p>
<p>Or, maybe investing in something else that would lead to job creation. For example my friends run a green energy company and they do geo thermal drilling and solar panels. They just purchased a new drill that is superior to the local competition. With this, they were able to hire 5 more of my friends. Although now looking at it, maybe that would cost 5 jobs from the competition <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> This is why im not into economics</p>
<p>Hate to keep bringing up Canada, but this is the problem with Harper. he is completely opposed to having terms with these tax cuts despite the fact that their sole intention is job creation. It just doesnt make sense unless he really is a puppet for the rich.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I watched this with my own country already. Harper put his faith in tax cuts, and over the last year the unemployment rate has not moved. The labour force increased by 185,000 people but only added 176,000 jobs. Population growth was 1.2%, but employment grew only 1%. There are 72,000 less youth employed than this time last year (and note that we are a small populated country). Investment in factories etc has decreased while stock piles of money have increased. Harper has admitted they aren’t working, he keeps “urging” businesses to start using the savings on their workers (since they haven’t been) and is complaining that they are stock piling money. Harpers solution? We need even more cuts next year! Fuck me.</p>
<p>Another problem that should be considered, is that a business can substantially reduce their employee’s and will still receive tax cuts.</p>
<p>Frell, if a small business needs more workers but can’t afford them, than absolutely this would help! I just think this needs to be regulated more. If you don’t use it on employees, you don’t get the savings. Issue fixed</p>
<p>edit: And on topic to the debate, Romney said he has no clue what tax break you get for shipping jobs overseas. I wished Obama would word this better. If you move your business overseas you can claim it as a business expense like any other business expense. This should honestly be stopped. As if the cheap labour wasn’t an incentive enough that they can practically move there for free! Romney plays stupid but knows exactly what Obama was saying.</p>

It would cost more in general to operate too. They pay the people in china what, .50 an hour? If they were forced to pay them $7 an hour and manufacture at the same rate here in America the price of an iphone would be $3000 lol</p>
