              <p>are you conneting to your no-ip address?</p>
<p>If so change it so you connect to 127.0.0.1<br>
But the other people who use your client should connect to you no-ip address.</p>
<p>Should work fine then <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If that don’t work then you should download port checker from <a href="http://www.portfoward.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.portfoward.com</a> to check if your port is opened correctly.</p>
