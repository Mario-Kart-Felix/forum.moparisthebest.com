    <description>Hey,

So I&#39;ve been trying to code some unique mining.

What I [u][b]want[/b][/u] to happen:

-I want the mining to be: when you click a rock, you go through a full mining animation, then receive an ore, and stop mining. You click the rock again, you receive another ore after the full animation, and repeat. I don&#39;t want the ore to run out at all, so you can continuously click the rock, do the mining animation, and receive an ore.

 
This is my code in mining.java :

[code]                Copper_Ore(1, 10, 436, 10, 10, 14906, 0, 1), 
		Tin_Ore(1, 10, 438, 10, 10, 14902, 0, 1), 
		Iron_Ore(15, 15, 440, 10, 10, 14856, 0, 1), 
		Coal_Ore(30, 25, 453, 10, 10, 14850, 0, 1), 
		Gold_Ore(40, 32, 444, 10, 10, 2098, 0, 1), 
		Mithril_Ore(55, 40, 447, 10, 10, 14853, 0, 1), 
		Adamant_Ore(70, 45, 449, 10, 10, 14862, 0, 1), 
		Runite_Ore(85, 50, 451, 10, 10, 14859, 0, 1);[/code]

When I mine one of the rocks, it entirely disappears after I receive an ore, and doesn&#39;t come back. It also does not take the full mining animation to receive an ore, the timer is completely random. 

Also, I can only mine the rocks when I&#39;m west of the rock, south of the rock, and north of the rock. Why not east?</description>
