[B][SIZE=5]FreedScape Introduction![/SIZE][/B]

Dear Moparscape Community, today I would like to excite you with our newest project release that is called FreedZone! FreedZone is based on TridiaxV3 source and our little team of developers who have worked on it for days to come up with the best results for our upcoming players. We decided to bring this game with the idea to full fill your dreams to come true. [/CENTER]

[I][CENTER]Freedzone is a project of dreams of our players. It is based on players and what they wish to add to the game. We hope this will be the first server that has so much freedom and so much choices for our players to make. This means, we will never ignore you with your suggestions and ideas, because every idea can make a change in our game whether it is a good idea or a bad idea. Because game is still in beta version, we don&#39;t have a lot added but thats why we want a quick release so you guys can suggest things to add. Our developers are keen to start coding, coding is their life and so they are waiting for you to speak. Every suggestion you make, will be considered and answered. Since our coders like to code, they can promise you that they will be adding more new commands for players, more minigames, more bosses, totally new quests and more! This project is concentrated on the players, maybe you want to add something you dreamed of in runescape or any rsps that they never added to the game, consider is to be done if your suggestion doesn;t ruin anyone&#39;s fun and as long as it doesn&#39;t ruin our economy.
