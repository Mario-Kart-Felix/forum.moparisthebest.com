    <title>Reseting environment variables</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reseting-environment-variables/218076</link>
    <description>Hi, i kind of messed up on the whole making my own private server thing and now i can&#39;t play any private servers i think it has something to do with my envrionment variables and when i changed them. Does anybody know how to reset the environment variables.
The message i get when trying to open a private server client is.. &#39;The system cannot find the path specified. &#39;JAVA&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

If anybody has any idea how to fix it i would be thankfull and love you forever  :D[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 07, 2008, 06:39:55 AM[/size][hr]Somebody HELP!</description>
