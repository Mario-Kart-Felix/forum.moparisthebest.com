    <title>This is how to fix your geothermal generator, said nobody</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-is-how-to-fix-your-geothermal-generator-said-nobody/513797</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve tried for a while to fix this, I&#39;ve had Fuscate, snuffly, and others try and help me but to no avail. This thing just wont work, Fuscate even compared his to mine and they were exactly the same, I may of edited it in an incorrect fashion since then but surely I&#39;m doing something wrong that Fuscate isn&#39;t. I&#39;d appreciate any help :)

The lava source is directly below the pump, and the pump does extend and reach into the lava source. The problem is it isn&#39;t transporting it into the generator, or the tank, or into the pipe at all for that matter. I&#39;ve tried many variations of pipes, heights and what not without success.

Any FTB experts among us? I&#39;m hoping this is a trivial mistake on my part, being somewhat of a FTB newcomer. My only thoughts are that I have the engines in the wrong spot, or the pipe? I watched a youtube video design it like mine, and it works.  :confused:</description>
