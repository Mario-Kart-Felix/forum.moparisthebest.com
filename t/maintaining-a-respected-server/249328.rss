Alright so, first thing&#39;s first. Creating and maintaining a respected good server! You may think it&#39;s not hard to make a server and through random crap into it and call it a server, well because it&#39;s not but see that&#39;s not a good server who want&#39;s to play a server that is just the same as the last 10 server&#39;s they played, if you know what i mean. So i&#39;m going to go over the main thing&#39;s that will get you and your server past success.

No one want&#39;s to play on a laggy, down-most-of-the-time server do they? No and to do this you don&#39;t need a dedicated server, nope. Just a well designed server, and a little bit of a computer. What i mean by that is, not your moms old Windows 98 beater. You going to need a somewhat decent PC. I&#39;ll make a list of the low requirements for a &quot;decent&quot; PC.


[ul][*]Atleast 1.50GB of RAM/Memory
[*]Intel® Pentium® dual-core processor or a AMD Athlon 64 Processor
[*]Some type of firewall. I would say ZoneAlarm.[/ul]


Alright now let&#39;s break down that list and explain why each one is important for running a server.

We need a decent amount of RAM because when running a server it&#39;s using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and that will use a lot of your RAM, and the more the computer can process that the faster and smoother it will run the JVM for the server. Therefore RAM is greatly important.

Having a Good processor is the most important thing you can have in hosting a server because if you have a old processor than the JVM will use all the CPU up and make your computer lag, when that happens if you try doing anything on the computer while your hosting a server, you will lag the server horribly. It&#39;s still not wise to do anything on the computer while hosting a server even if you do have a duel-core processor (a fast good processor) because it will still leave a tink of lag for the server to deal with.

Your going to need a firewall when having a open port for the public to access, with that open port hackers can plant virus and what not so easy. So to stay safe use a firewall i would perfer ZoneAlarm.

[IMG]http://s366.photobucket.com/albums/oo110/gnarlican/yourinternet.png[/img]
So, say you have this amazing fast computer right? 4GB of ram, Duel-Core processor, All that good stuff. But with bad internet connection that good computer is now trash when it come&#39;s to hosting a server. I bet you never would have thought about your internet provider having anything to do with hosting a a server, well sorry bud but it&#39;s very important.

Q: How do i know if my internet is is good?
A: Test your internet speed on [URL=http://&quot;http://speedtest.net/&quot;]http://speedtest.net/[/URL]

So now that you have tested your internet on the speedtest, it&#39;s time to tell if your results are good or bad. First we&#39;re going to take a look at the upload speed you got. If you got a upload speed around 100, sorry but it not going to do you any good in hosting a server, around 300 your going to have a stable server but it can be better, around 600 you will have a pretty fast server, anything higher than that is perfect. Okay now for download speed, with great upload comes better download, your download speed will never be lower than your upload speed. But when it comes to hosting a server download is not that important, because you&#39;re Hosting the server therefore your uploading it to the internet your not downloading it to the internet, see where i&#39;m getting with this? So upload speed is more important with hosting a server.

[B]Bandwidth[/B]
So well, you have a bandwidth on your internet and hosting a server will cause that bandwidth to be used up, and rather quickly. Although i never seen a person complain about their bandwidth be ran up from hosting a runescape private server. So i would not worry too much about this, i&#39;m just telling you it&#39;s possible if you have a fairly large server.

[B]Wireless vs. Direct Connect[/B]
Alright you guessed it, direct connect with a ethernet cable is better than using a wireless receiver, because the signal is not always full so in random times the server will lag terribly. Pretty basic stuff, ethernet is better than wireless. If you can, use a ethernet cord. If you cannot get access to using a ethernet cord than i guess you better find a way or try to make your signal for your wireless internet secure and in range. When i say secure i mean put a WEP password on it so other people by you cannot use your internet and run up the bandwidth on your internet. When i say in range i mean, close near your computer with the wireless receiver so that you get a some-what good connection.

[IMG]http://s366.photobucket.com/albums/oo110/gnarlican/serverdesign.png[/img]
Okay, now if we have a good computer and fast internet, there is still another thing that will cause lag and a unreliable server. The server&#39;s framework is a big part of hosting a reliable server. Say for example you have tons of junk being processed in the server&#39;s cycle (process boolean/void) will cause all kinds of lag. Say you have saveGame(); being called i the cycle. Are you joking me!? Go take a look at the saveGame() void and look at how huge it is, and it&#39;s being called every 500ms that&#39;s every half a second. You try to do the same thing every half a second for atleast 10 seconds. It&#39;s impossible. So you know how hard the JVM is working for that simple thing in the cycle. Keep your process clean, there are different ways than the process to do things. Try looking into Grahams event manager tutorial.

[B]Multi-Login[/B]
Having a stable server is easy, block multi-login. Your like wow, thanks for telling me but HOW!? Well hold on i was getting to that, Those of you who think putting a little script in the run() void in client.java is the right way. Well sorry to burst your bubble but all that does is make it worse. Why? Because your kicking the null/SYI whatever you want to call it, so once it&#39;s kicked it can login again and you may think, &quot;Well it can usually change it&#39;s name&quot; true, but if it&#39;s already been logged in once it has a character file and if it logs in for a second time it will load that file and cause more lag that it would if it couldn&#39;t login again. Get what i&#39;m saying? So the fix would be to check for multi-login before the socket for that connection is made. This would take place in the run() void in server.java. A good idea is to check for banned IP&#39;s/Names and multi-login in the run void in server.java because it&#39;s before the socket is made and it cause less lag.

[B]Thread-Per-Client[/B]
In all winterlove based server&#39;s (that&#39;s 90% of all servers) there is thread-per-client and it&#39;s horrible. Let me explain what it is, thread-per-client is when every time a player connects a new thread on the JVM is made, so what if you have 200 players online at once, than you have 200 threads running. Each thread run&#39;s up ram and CPU not much but when you have a lot of them running it makes a noticeable amount. So we need to remove it. The best thing to do is limit the number of threads to run, or just flat out remove it. Graham has made a great tutorial for removing thread-per-client and it&#39;s great i personally love it.

[IMG]http://s366.photobucket.com/albums/oo110/gnarlican/economy.png[/img]
The economy in a server has to be the most important thing you can possibly think of. If you can train to fast or get items to easy or make money to fast/easy than your economy will soon fall and people will get board of playing your server and quit. So you need a well thought of economy, not too hard like real runescape but not easy, try to make rare items RARE, no object training because you will get massive clicking making lag and that&#39;s noob to have object training NPC training is the best way. When trying to make a good economy you need money and prices on items to buy, try to use real runescape prices but even if you do that, you need a good way for people to earn money but not to fast.

Let&#39;s get into more detail about the training, and earning items. If you were to train fast say get a 99 skill in less than a week, it would be way to easy. Getting a 99 skill and earning a skillcape should be more rewarding and how would it be rewarding if it can be done in only 7 days? See what i mean? Now same goes for getting items, if you can make the money for a party hat in 4 days, that&#39;s extremely easy and the economy is horrible. party hats should take weeks, months to earn. The party hat is only one example this should go for all items.

[IMG]http://s366.photobucket.com/albums/oo110/gnarlican/commands.png[/img]
Commands should only be used for moderation and moderation only. Not for public use! When you have a command that teleports you, the new players might not know about it and people might forget about it, ect. And it makes the server too easy, they have feet they can walk. When you have a command that gives you a item, than you can just quit hosting a server, because your economy will fall don&#39;t matter what that command gives you. Because there should only be these commands in a server (only for staff);


[ul][*]::ipban {victim}
[*]::ban {victim}
[*]::unban {victim}
[*]::mute {victim}
[*]::unmute {victim}
[*]::teleport {xcoord} {ycoord}
[*]::xteletome {victim}
[*]::xteleto {victim}
[*]::yell {message}[/ul]


Use the teleport command to teleport to a set x and y coord on the map grid.
Use the xteletome command to teleport a person to you.
Use the xteleto command to teleport to a person.
Use the yell command to yell out a message to all players to announce somthing.
The other commands are self explain.

[IMG]http://s366.photobucket.com/albums/oo110/gnarlican/pickingstaff.png[/img]
When i see them servers that say &quot;First one in gets mod&quot; i think of them as a noob server. When picking staff you need to take time on it, and chose wisely. It should take a long time for someone to earn staff, they need to show that they are trustworthy for the job and they are active to moderate the server. Never let someone be a admin unless they are part in development in the website and or server.
Things to look for when you chose a moderator.


[ul][*]Follows all rules
[*]Tells other to follow rules
[*]Uses the report abuse when it&#39;s needed
[*]Helps out others when they need help
[*]Good grammar and english
[*]Active player so they can moderate actively[/ul]

Them are the things i would look for in picking staff, and i&#39;m sure it&#39;s what jagex would do also.

[IMG]http://s366.photobucket.com/albums/oo110/gnarlican/serverwebsite.png[/img]
Every server needs a website for a forum atleast and sometimes a webclient, ect. Not one of them smfforfree sites, because they are just plain out noob. I&#39;m talking about your own domain. The main point of having a website is for forums, so the players of your server can talk about the server rant, post suggestions, show off their character, report bugs, reportplayers, complement, ect. You need to have people discuss about the server. Else you will not know what the people want or whats wrong.

[IMG]http://s366.photobucket.com/albums/oo110/gnarlican/advertising.png[/img]
Without advertising your not going to get a big server, so that&#39;s thy you need to advertise your server all over, so than people will know about it and play it. That don&#39;t mean you should go off and spam forums and websites with your URL, because that will get you enemies and people that want to crash your server and or website. So advertise safely! Some ideas for safe advertising.


[ul][*]Post your server in all the serverstatus pages you know
[*]Post your server in all the forums that allow advertising
[*]Post your server on top list sites
[*]Tell your players to tell their friends and their friends and so on[/ul]

Them are only the basic things, i&#39;m sure you will think of more things that work.

and stopped, because thats the horrible thing about WL servers. My RS 2 Blitz server runs fine on a Windows 98 computer, with a 233 MHZ processor, and 32 MB of RAM. Now, this obviously wouldn’t hold the 2000 people my server supports, but its held my ~10 beta testers just fine, with no server-side lag.</p>
<p>Just mention all those computer requirements are one of the huge faults of WinterLove and I’ll be happy. ;)[/quote]<br>
hoooooooooooly shet!</p>
<p>my server is gonna be a pentium 2.4 ghz with 768 mb ram.<br>
can that hold 2000 people? lol</p>
