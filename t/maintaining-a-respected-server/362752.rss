    <title>Maintaining a Respected Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/maintaining-a-respected-server/362752</link>
    <description>Before beginning this tutorial, let me introduce myself. My name is QuestMaster 2K10, and i&#39;ve been with Java for four years, and with Private-Servers for three. I&#39;ve been playing RuneScape for six years. I use to be famous for 508 servers, that have exeeded over 20,000 accounts throughout my years of Private-Servers. 

[b]So what is this tutorial about?[/b]

Well i&#39;ve seen so many servers out there that have constantly failed and failed, with nothing more but the same stuff on every server you see out there. It&#39;s like one server is just the same as any other one because so many people don&#39;t have a single idea on what they should add or how to maintain it. I wanted to help those server makes by giving them an idea on how they should maintain their server so it can be respected by everyone, that anyone can enjoy.


[b]Step 1:[/b]

A server needs a steady Economy. This is amongst the most important step of all. Without a steady and balanced economy, just about everyone will be rich or everyone will be poor. To know that a server has a steady economy, there should be only some people that are poor, half the server should be Middle class (in between rich and poor), and then there should only be some people that are rich (As in 50-250m coins rich). Why? Because if everyone is absolutley rich, then they&#39;ve pretty much experienced everything that can be earned. They won&#39;t want to have to beat quests, because they figure that already all they want. Skills will be pretty much maxed out, like Firemaking, Smithing, Prayer, or skills like that because they can use so much coins on them that they&#39;ll barley need to train. [b]The most important step is maintaining a well-balanced Economy![/b]

[b]Step 2:[/b]

You&#39;ll also need to keep at a steady XP system. Don&#39;t give too much XP to someone, but also don&#39;t give only some. Give the players XP at a steady rate so everyone won&#39;t be the same levels. I once logged into a server and everyone was either level 3, or everyone was level 138, and this is like 20-30 DIFFERENT people i&#39;m talking about. That&#39;s lame as hell. That&#39;s why you should keep at a steady XP base system.

[b]Step 3:[/b]

Add daily content updates. This is important, because without daily content updates a player might get board of doing the same thing over and over. To keep players and to gain more, add daily content updates that will keep them occupied enough to not be board.

[b]Step 4:[/b]

Think of something, something that will really satisfy your players, like an update. But the update has to be something that no other server has, which will make it unique and will attract new players to your server. For example. A long time ago, when 525s were just being released, some Moparscapian made an all-new update that NO other server had before! It was the Grand Exchange. He earned over 2,000 players for this. Why? Because No other server had it, which made it unique!

[b]Step 5:[/b]

Make sure your server has rules and punishments. You&#39;ll need this if you want to keep gameplay fair, and to prevent Spammers, Botters, and Hackers from doing something they shouldn&#39;t by banning them or IP-Banning them. Write a consitution for your server, and swear to always follow it even in the roughest of times.

[b]Step 6:[/b]

Add skill features that you won&#39;t find on any other server, or at least hard to find on other servers. This also makes YOUR server unique from others. The most famous Skills are, Hunter, Agility, Summoning, and Construction. Those are probably the hardest skills to add, but they&#39;re also hard to find on other servers. Add these, and your server will be a hotspot for skilling!

[b]Step 7:[/b]

Instead of adding just one area to train a skill, add several. This makes your server more fascinating, and fun and realistic. This is very popular on [b]Bulby&#39;s[/b] server.

[b]Step 8:[/b]

Add Miscellaneous features to your server such as, Skillcapes, Music and Sound Effects, Timers, Specials on Weapons, and GFXs over certain types of actions. This makes the server look realist and show the players that you actually are trying to maintain the server respectfully.

[b]Step 9:[/b]

Quests, or Minigames is also an Attraction that players like. Usually people who are looking for skilling-type servers look forward to Quest-type activities. And usually players that like activities such as PKing, Dueling, and etc, look forward to Minigame-type features. So you should add both, so you can have both types of players on your server. Trust me, if you have really good Quests and Minigames (PKing being the most popular), you&#39;ll have a very attracted server.

[b]Step 10:[/b]

Commands should only be for moderation. Some commands however in my opinion, won&#39;t be problem to be allowed such as, &quot;::yell&quot;, and such. To many commands will make your server look like a lazy server, which is kind of gay.

[b]Step 11:[/b]

Make sure your server is a descent uptime. Don&#39;t keep your server offline too much, because then players will grow board and find a different server to play. And when it is online, try to keep it lag-free, if possible. The players want the best gameplay possible to enjoy a descent server.




[i]These are all of the steps I used to maintain my very server for three years straight. I STILL have players from two, or three years ago that still play my very same server and still enjoy it. Maybe this will help everyone in the future, when they think of building a server to the top. Please comment, saying what you think a well-respected server should be like.[/i]</description>

No, Java, and RuneScape Java are different (tequnically). And no, this is tequnically a tutorial for Private-Servers, so therefor it’s in the tutorial section. This is NOT in the wrong section.<br>

<p>What exactly is “Runescape Java”[/quote]</p>
<p>RuneScript.</p>
<p>Jagex uses their own coding language (In a sense) even though it’s heavily based off Java.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Before beginning this tutorial, let me introduce myself. My name is QuestMaster 2K10, and i’ve been with Java for four years, and with Private-Servers for three. I’ve been playing RuneScape for six years. I use to be famous for 508 servers, that have exeeded over 20,000 accounts throughout my years of Private-Servers.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">So what is this tutorial about?</span></p>
<p>Well i’ve seen so many servers out there that have constantly failed and failed, with nothing more but the same stuff on every server you see out there. It’s like one server is just the same as any other one because so many people don’t have a single idea on what they should add or how to maintain it. I wanted to help those server makes by giving them an idea on how they should maintain their server so it can be respected by everyone, that anyone can enjoy.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 1:</span></p>
<p>A server needs a steady Economy. This is amongst the most important step of all. Without a steady and balanced economy, just about everyone will be rich or everyone will be poor. To know that a server has a steady economy, there should be only some people that are poor, half the server should be Middle class (in between rich and poor), and then there should only be some people that are rich (As in 50-250m coins rich). Why? Because if everyone is absolutley rich, then they’ve pretty much experienced everything that can be earned. They won’t want to have to beat quests, because they figure that already all they want. Skills will be pretty much maxed out, like Firemaking, Smithing, Prayer, or skills like that because they can use so much coins on them that they’ll barley need to train. <span class="bbcode-b">The most important step is maintaining a well-balanced Economy!</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 2:</span></p>
<p>You’ll also need to keep at a steady XP system. Don’t give too much XP to someone, but also don’t give only some. Give the players XP at a steady rate so everyone won’t be the same levels. I once logged into a server and everyone was either level 3, or everyone was level 138, and this is like 20-30 DIFFERENT people i’m talking about. That’s lame as hell. That’s why you should keep at a steady XP base system.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 3:</span></p>
<p>Add daily content updates. This is important, because without daily content updates a player might get board of doing the same thing over and over. To keep players and to gain more, add daily content updates that will keep them occupied enough to not be board.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 4:</span></p>
<p>Think of something, something that will really satisfy your players, like an update. But the update has to be something that no other server has, which will make it unique and will attract new players to your server. For example. A long time ago, when 525s were just being released, some Moparscapian made an all-new update that NO other server had before! It was the Grand Exchange. He earned over 2,000 players for this. Why? Because No other server had it, which made it unique!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 5:</span></p>
<p>Make sure your server has rules and punishments. You’ll need this if you want to keep gameplay fair, and to prevent Spammers, Botters, and Hackers from doing something they shouldn’t by banning them or IP-Banning them. Write a consitution for your server, and swear to always follow it even in the roughest of times.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 6:</span></p>
<p>Add skill features that you won’t find on any other server, or at least hard to find on other servers. This also makes YOUR server unique from others. The most famous Skills are, Hunter, Agility, Summoning, and Construction. Those are probably the hardest skills to add, but they’re also hard to find on other servers. Add these, and your server will be a hotspot for skilling!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 7:</span></p>
<p>Instead of adding just one area to train a skill, add several. This makes your server more fascinating, and fun and realistic. This is very popular on <span class="bbcode-b">Bulby’s</span> server.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 8:</span></p>
<p>Add Miscellaneous features to your server such as, Skillcapes, Music and Sound Effects, Timers, Specials on Weapons, and GFXs over certain types of actions. This makes the server look realist and show the players that you actually are trying to maintain the server respectfully.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 9:</span></p>
<p>Quests, or Minigames is also an Attraction that players like. Usually people who are looking for skilling-type servers look forward to Quest-type activities. And usually players that like activities such as PKing, Dueling, and etc, look forward to Minigame-type features. So you should add both, so you can have both types of players on your server. Trust me, if you have really good Quests and Minigames (PKing being the most popular), you’ll have a very attracted server.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 10:</span></p>
<p>Commands should only be for moderation. Some commands however in my opinion, won’t be problem to be allowed such as, “::yell”, and such. To many commands will make your server look like a lazy server, which is kind of gay.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 11:</span></p>
<p>Make sure your server is a descent uptime. Don’t keep your server offline too much, because then players will grow board and find a different server to play. And when it is online, try to keep it lag-free, if possible. The players want the best gameplay possible to enjoy a descent server.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">These are all of the steps I used to maintain my very server for three years straight. I STILL have players from two, or three years ago that still play my very same server and still enjoy it. Maybe this will help everyone in the future, when they think of building a server to the top. Please comment, saying what you think a well-respected server should be like.</span></p>
