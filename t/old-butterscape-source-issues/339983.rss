    <description>haven&#39;t done a 317 in ages, need help....
The player savegames in the 317 butterscape source isn&#39;t saving the way i want it. It&#39;s saving in the .dat format (like in a 508) BUT you cannot see the ranking and the stats part of it. IMO 317 is dead, and i don&#39;t even thinks this is real butterscape either :P it looks more a like an old paladin source... Just... help...


for those of you who know me as a coding expert HOW MANY TIMES DO I SAY THIS! I work with 508&#39;s ONLY, and .dat has really nothing to do with Java except with some source coding.</description>
