<p>2-ok your a starter but il try to explain…</p>
<p>the emotes of the walk/stand etc are based on a person/player it is not possible to  walk like a real dragon if u do not have these emotes and u do not have the knowledgend of editing the emotes so u walk like a dragon when u are a dragon.</p>
<p>to change into a npc u type ::pnpc NPC ID here<br>
for example the kbd (king black dragon) ::pnpc 50</p>
<p>will make u change in a dragon and then u will see what i mean whit the rong emotes.</p>
