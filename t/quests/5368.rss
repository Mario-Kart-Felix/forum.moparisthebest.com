    <description>Hey,

I&#39;ve been thinking of an original way to have a server. As most are taken and have loyal players (PKing servers mainly), I&#39;ve thought of another one, Quests!

I&#39;m going to have my server be a Fully Fledged Quest server, with most, if not all, up to date quests and mini-games.

Now, my question is, does anyone know where the info for quests are? Also, does anyone also have the correct way to input quest related data and dialogue? I swear that I saw a tutorial on Kaitneiks, but as that&#39;s gone...well..you know.

Thank you for any help.</description>

              <p>Well, this may not help as much to you if your not a advanced coder but if you get the testscape sorce and have a look at it’s “Invisable armor” Quest you may be able to make your own…<br>
Hope this helps ;D</p>
