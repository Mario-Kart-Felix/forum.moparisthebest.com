    <title>Destroying item instead of dropping. Can anyone help!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/destroying-item-instead-of-dropping-can-anyone-help/262447</link>
    <description>How do I make it so when I player wants to drop an item it asks them to drop again if they wish to destroy it. And instead of the item ending up on the ground it just deletes that item. I seen it on dodian before the new update, I would very well much appreciate it since there is drop dupers. Can anyone help?</description>
