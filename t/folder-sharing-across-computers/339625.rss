    <description>I&#39;m just curious to know what you guys use for sharing folders across multiple computers and/or operating systems.  I was going to try ubuntu one, but then learned that there is no client for KDE and the gnome client won&#39;t even run in it in the current release (lucid).

So, here are the options I know about:
1. Ubuntu One, only works in gnome though.
2. Dropbox, requires nautilus (gnome).
3. rsync, requires me to write my own scripts, would need cygwin on windows. great across internet and LAN.
4. CIFS/SAMBA, works on all operating systems without additional software, but no compression, optimization, and is a network filesystem, which means nothing is local and is therefore slow.  Decent for LAN, but horrible for internet.
5. git, I only use this for programming, and love it, but keeping versions of a folder&#39;s contents seems redundant.

So, with those options, I&#39;m heavily leaning towards writing my own scripts and using rsync.

So what do you guys use?  And what would you suggest?</description>

<p>It works on windows, linux, and mac osx.  They are also very open about how it works, so you can be assured that your data is secure and safe.  Also they do release some code open source.  Win, win, win. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p>For free, which is more than enough for my needs.  You can get 100gb for $8/month though with a coupon code from <a href="http://retailmenot.com">retailmenot.com</a>, so that’s a pretty good deal for people who need more space too.</p>

              <p>I’m just curious to know what you guys use for sharing folders across multiple computers and/or operating systems.  I was going to try ubuntu one, but then learned that there is no client for KDE and the gnome client won’t even run in it in the current release (lucid).</p>
<p>So, here are the options I know about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ubuntu One, only works in gnome though.</li>
<li>Dropbox, requires nautilus (gnome).</li>
<li>rsync, requires me to write my own scripts, would need cygwin on windows. great across internet and LAN.</li>
<li>CIFS/SAMBA, works on all operating systems without additional software, but no compression, optimization, and is a network filesystem, which means nothing is local and is therefore slow.  Decent for LAN, but horrible for internet.</li>
<li>git, I only use this for programming, and love it, but keeping versions of a folder’s contents seems redundant.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, with those options, I’m heavily leaning towards writing my own scripts and using rsync.</p>
<p>So what do you guys use?  And what would you suggest?</p>
