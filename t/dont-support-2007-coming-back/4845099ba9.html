<p>Just more money whoring on their side, they are only allowing members to vote because free to play users just aren’t profitable, it’s funny how when they talk they seem to try to fool us to think otherwise. Jagex will reach 50,000 - 100,000 at the max, they will never reach 250,000, it’s kind of apparent they don’t even have 250,000 active members paying currently. RuneScape has become a ghost world that only those who have played to long to want to quit and the botters that sell those characters gold exist. They aren’t rejecting releasing the amount of subscribers they have because they are “a private company”, they are doing so because showing how many people really still subscribe to RuneScape pushes the fact that they have become a hollowed out shell even more and makes it apparent that these RS2007 severs will not come back for anything less than $15 in addition to your monthly subscription.  You heard me right, in addition, that means what ever you’re paying now, add $15 onto it.</p>
<p>In a world that really loves torrents, no one who actually understands what the internet is would pay for something that is free somewhere else, even if that means losing a little resolution on your video or in the case of private servers, waiting a little between updates. Private servers will not fall, infact, this will push even more users to realize what’s great about private servers after they get all hyped up and see that $22-$30 a month price tag for a game riddled with bots and a development team that could give to shits about your playing experience as long as they are getting paid.</p>

<p>Not really, I’ve never hosted a server that got it’s funding from anything other than pure donations, nor have i belonged to a team that did otherwise. I’m not talking about “Donate and get this item”, I’m talking about pure donations, no ingame ranks, no special items, just a thanks for supporting the communities server costs. Back when I use to host projects we’d just post a thread once a month that said what our next bill was and how much we needed to be sound for another month though when we did this we often got enough for 2-3 months in advance, kinda of like what Wiki does, they ask for donations and when they reach their goal they stop bothering you.</p>

Jagex would have to get 400k-350k brand new subscribers by the time the pole closes in two weeks, and that’s with every single person remembering to vote.</p>

<p>Do not support this, and let Jagex burn like its suppose to![/quote]<br>
Alright, your second paragraph that you stated is completely retarded. Everything is about money in this world today. You’re saying, you’d rather not make money for your business from a game that you made/constantly update than to not give the community everything they want? Life isn’t fair, you will not get everything you want. And with your last comment, Jagex isn’t going to ‘burn’ because something went wrong with an out of date server that isn’t the main game.</p>

Go look at WoW… They started off charging $15 a month <span class="bbcode-b">PLUS</span> buying a $60 disk. I’d say RuneScape is in demand since players are still playing it. I still play it, even after all of the changes since 2006 (when I started playing). I haven’t complained a whole lot about their updates because I’m susceptible to change, unlike majority of everyone in this community. Everyone complains that Jagex is shit and stuff, <span class="bbcode-b">RuneScape</span> private servers wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for <span class="bbcode-b">RuneScape</span>. Companies make things for profit and to please their customers. I’d say those two are about equal. Sometimes, you can’t always please everyone. But change is needed for a business and is needed to make profits.</p>

</aside>
<p>Stop reading my mind.<br>
Blizzards service overall unparalleled. Even before the EoC, their service wasn’t impressive at all. When I paid 15 a month for WoW I didn’t feel like I was wasting my money. By the time SoF was out I felt like the quality of updates was not worth paying for and by EoC I never wanted to play rs again. As a 10 year veteran, Jagex has alienated me to the point where all fun was sucked from the game.</p>
<p>Jagex isn’t the same and it never will be.</p>

also all the people ripping on jagex  for trying to make money off people, that is what a buisiness does and im sure you are trying to do the same thing with your private servers or else you wouldnt be selling phat sets for 20 bucks.<br>
[/quote]<br>
People shouldn’t be abandoning rsps, they should be protecting it and banding together now more than ever.[/quote]<br>
From all my past experiences and current thoughts, I have finally realized that anything that involves RS2 emulation is a complete waste of time and research, and should be completely abandoned. Not only do private servers pull customers (players) away from a business (Jagex), but it literally provides a false sense of accomplishment for whatever reason you are developing (or leeching) a private server, whether it is for monetary gain, knowledge, or just fun. People like you need to finally grow out of this era and realize that the only true reason this community was created was for knowledge and documentation on how we predicted this game we loved was created. It is quite contradictory of everyone to say how much they hate a game that was derived from an idea of something they work with every day.</p>
<p>I am not saying you should stop any research or anything related to knowledge of these emulations; however, people need to stop creating these hopeless ‘groups’ that protect the very thing that has caused such a huge loss in of players on RS, even before the EOC. In other words, if you are doing any emulation for fun, money, or even in revolt against Jagex, you should highly consider otherwise.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">In all honesty, I believe the very thing that every created this nostalgia for wanting the old RuneScape back was the creation of the very first RS2 emulation. If it weren’t for this, people would most likely have adapted to each new update, eventually realizing that most of the updates were for the GOOD of the game. The only people I ever catch complaining about the EOC (in most cases), are the ones that still support private servers. <span class="bbcode-i">You are the ones that ruined RuneScape.</span></span></p>
<p>Also, comparing these changes to other games is a terrible analogy. In my opinion, RS is one of the most revolutionary games of the decade. There have been so many changes that someone playing the very first version in comparison to another person playing the most recent one would most likely not be able to realize they were the same game. That statement was a little far fetched, since the maps and general idea is basically the same, but I’m sure anyone with half a brain will understand what I’m trying to point out.</p>

From all my past experiences and current thoughts, I have finally realized that anything that involves RS2 emulation is a complete waste of time and research, and should be completely abandoned. Not only do private servers pull customers (players) away from a business (Jagex), but it literally provides a false sense of accomplishment for whatever reason you are developing (or leeching) a private server, whether it is for monetary gain, knowledge, or just fun. People like you need to finally grow out of this era and realize that the only true reason this community was created was for knowledge and documentation on how we predicted this game we loved was created. It is quite contradictory of everyone to say how much they hate a game that was derived from an idea of something they work with every day.</p>
<p>I am not saying you should stop any research or anything related to knowledge of these emulations; however, people need to stop creating these hopeless ‘groups’ that protect the very thing that has caused such a huge loss in of players on RS, even before the EOC. In other words, if you are doing any emulation for fun, money, or even in revolt against Jagex, you should highly consider otherwise.<br>

<p>I am not saying you should stop any research or anything related to knowledge of these emulations; however, people need to stop creating these hopeless ‘groups’ that protect the very thing that has caused such a huge loss in of players on RS, even before the EOC.

<p><span class="bbcode-b">In all honesty, I believe the very thing that every created this nostalgia for wanting the old RuneScape back was the creation of the very first RS2 emulation. If it weren’t for this, people would most likely have adapted to each new update, eventually realizing that most of the updates were for the GOOD of the game. The only people I ever catch complaining about the EOC (in most cases), are the ones that still support private servers. <span class="bbcode-i">You are the ones that ruined RuneScape.</span></span></p>
<p>Also, comparing these changes to other games is a terrible analogy. In my opinion, RS is one of the most revolutionary games of the decade. There have been so many changes that someone playing the very first version in comparison to another person playing the most recent one would most likely not be able to realize they were the same game. That statement was a little far fetched, since the maps and general idea is basically the same, but I’m sure anyone with half a brain will understand what I’m trying to point out.[/quote]<br>
EoC fanboy lolz. If you don’t like anything that this entire community has to offer then I suggest you leave. About 95% of the updates Jagex offered its players after and including Dungeoneering was horribly useless and only affected themselves in a positive way. They alienated their playerbase and ruined the game for most. Obviously their stock holders had something to do with the changes, but Jagex is still the company to blame. In the last… 3 years or so, Jagex has given us, among ALL of their updates, these positive updates:</p>
<ol>
<li>Toolbelt<br>
2.Runespan (which wasn’t even properly made as it did basically nothing but make RC a really easy 99)</li>
<li>Bonfires (Which should have been added YEARS ago but Jagex was just too damn lazy and busy not paying attention to the hundreds of people, including myself, who suggested this for years)</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously there have been some minor updates that have made the game more enjoyable and interesting, but for the most part and especially 2011+, it became a game of pay to win and microtransactions to suck its playerbase for as much money as they were worth.</p>
<p>So go have fun playing Solomon’s World of Squealscape, the rest of us are going to continue to cling to the things that made RS enjoyable and attempt to continue what could have been a very long lasting and eventful game.</p>
