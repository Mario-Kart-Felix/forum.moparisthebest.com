    <title>Dont support 2007 coming back!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dont-support-2007-coming-back/484509</link>
    <description>This is quite bullshit, i rather go on and support a runescape private server then play that shitty 2007 scape that is coming back. Look at what Jagex is doing, they are simply saying &quot;Runescape is going to shit, we are not making enough money, we will charge you 15 dollars each to play this shitty 2007 scape, unless you can get enough people to make us a lot of money threw advertising, go do that guys!&quot; 

I think anyone who supports this is a complete idiot, they are not giving the Community what they want, they are giving themselves more fucking money, and i do not support this in any way, RSPS forever, fuck Jagex, fuck runescape

Do not support this, and let Jagex burn like its suppose to!</description>

Explain to me what hasn’t gone through your head to realize they stopped caring about players, and if they see an opportunity to make money, they will go for it.<br>
They stated (Not exact quote) “We do not support buying your skills. But we have the option to buy spins on the sof, and you can get sof lamps”<br>
They had a promotion where if you were a member for 3 months, you got over 1m in free xp. Nope, not in it for the money <span class="bbcode-b">YET</span><br>

It’s not that we don’t want the server, it’s that they are milking it for money (in a painfully obvious way) as much as they can. There’s so problem with them making money, but putting it to a vote for members basically guaranteed that they wont hit the 250,000 mark and we’ll all be paying $15 a month for something they promised no service what so ever on. Them acting like this is a “risk” is just crazy, they know they will make money, TONS of money, but they want as much as they can get so they’re whoring it out.</p>

It’s not what I want. I think Jagex has ruined enough and personally wouldn’t really care whether they shut down or not. I enjoy my RSPS corner here. The community wants a 2006/7 style server obviously, but I don’t trust Jagex and I refuse to pay anything higher than 5.00 for their terrible customer service, sure as hell not paying 15.</p>

From all my past experiences and current thoughts, I have finally realized that anything that involves RS2 emulation is a complete waste of time and research, and should be completely abandoned. Not only do private servers pull customers (players) away from a business (Jagex), but it literally provides a false sense of accomplishment for whatever reason you are developing (or leeching) a private server, whether it is for monetary gain, knowledge, or just fun. People like you need to finally grow out of this era and realize that the only true reason this community was created was for knowledge and documentation on how we predicted this game we loved was created. It is quite contradictory of everyone to say how much they hate a game that was derived from an idea of something they work with every day.</p>
<p>I am not saying you should stop any research or anything related to knowledge of these emulations; however, people need to stop creating these hopeless ‘groups’ that protect the very thing that has caused such a huge loss in of players on RS, even before the EOC. In other words, if you are doing any emulation for fun, money, or even in revolt against Jagex, you should highly consider otherwise.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">In all honesty, I believe the very thing that every created this nostalgia for wanting the old RuneScape back was the creation of the very first RS2 emulation.

EoC fanboy lolz. If you don’t like anything that this entire community has to offer then I suggest you leave. About 95% of the updates Jagex offered its players after and including Dungeoneering was horribly useless and only affected themselves in a positive way. They alienated their playerbase and ruined the game for most. Obviously their stock holders had something to do with the changes, but Jagex is still the company to blame. In the last… 3 years or so, Jagex has given us, among ALL of their updates, these positive updates:</p>
<ol>
<li>Toolbelt<br>
2.Runespan (which wasn’t even properly made as it did basically nothing but make RC a really easy 99)</li>
<li>Bonfires (Which should have been added YEARS ago but Jagex was just too damn lazy and busy not paying attention to the hundreds of people, including myself, who suggested this for years)</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously there have been some minor updates that have made the game more enjoyable and interesting, but for the most part and especially 2011+, it became a game of pay to win and microtransactions to suck its playerbase for as much money as they were worth.</p>
<p>So go have fun playing Solomon’s World of Squealscape, the rest of us are going to continue to cling to the things that made RS enjoyable and attempt to continue what could have been a very long lasting and eventful game.</p>

<p>Stop reading my mind.<br>
Blizzards service overall unparalleled. Even before the EoC, their service wasn’t impressive at all. When I paid 15 a month for WoW I didn’t feel like I was wasting my money. By the time SoF was out I felt like the quality of updates was not worth paying for and by EoC I never wanted to play rs again. As a 10 year veteran, Jagex has alienated me to the point where all fun was sucked from the game.</p>

Go look at WoW… They started off charging $15 a month <span class="bbcode-b">PLUS</span> buying a $60 disk. I’d say RuneScape is in demand since players are still playing it. I still play it, even after all of the changes since 2006 (when I started playing). I haven’t complained a whole lot about their updates because I’m susceptible to change, unlike majority of everyone in this community. Everyone complains that Jagex is shit and stuff, <span class="bbcode-b">RuneScape</span> private servers wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for <span class="bbcode-b">RuneScape</span>. Companies make things for profit and to please their customers. I’d say those two are about equal. Sometimes, you can’t always please everyone. But change is needed for a business and is needed to make profits.</p>
