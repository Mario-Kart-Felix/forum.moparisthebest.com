    <description>I am going to start and try to learn Java and was wondering if you guys can give me any tips when you first started Java that helped you. I downloaded eclipse is that&#39;s the best Java editor/coding program around?</description>

<p>There are mixed opinions about Eclipse. I personally don’t like it but that’s my view.

<p>Eclipse has a similar plugin called <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">WindowBuilder</a> which creates GUIs and generates the code for them.</p>

<p>You may pickup a lot of bad habits but the only way you’ll start producing quality code is when you start learning about whats good and bad. Try looking at work that has been acknowledged as good code such as looking at work produced by Graham or other smart people.</p>
<p>Talking to other people who know the subject well will also help you pick a few things.</p>
<p>That’s how it all started and worked with me anyway.</p>
<p>Just a note on using the Java docs. They are very useful but as a novice many people may not understand them. It’ll take you getting use to but once you get the hang of it you’ll be able to produce code quick and effectively.</p>
