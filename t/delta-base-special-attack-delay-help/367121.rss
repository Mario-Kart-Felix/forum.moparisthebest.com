    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-base-special-attack-delay-help/367121</link>
    <description>I am currently using a source with Delta base and I had noticed a delay that is set whenever I click for a special attack. I have been searching through several statements to find this declared delay, but I can&#39;t seem to find it :|. If anybody had encountered this problem before and found the solution, I&#39;d appreciate you sharing it with me, it will truly meen a lot to me :).</description>
