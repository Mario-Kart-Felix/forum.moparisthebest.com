              <p>Everything to do with a player first logging in is inside of player.java (well, atleast all the stuff that you’re interested in).</p>
<p>You can change the x and y coordinates of a first player’s login, and what they’re wearing inside of that. Just browse through the beginning of it (first few dozens of lines).</p>
