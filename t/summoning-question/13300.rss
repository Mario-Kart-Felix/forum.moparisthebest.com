    <title>Summoning Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/summoning-question/13300</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been testing out Summoning on the Cheezscape v. 80 release and I was wondering where to find the code for adding in things into the music tab. Such as the &quot;Green=Unlocked&quot;, where do I find the code so that I can edit it. Flame me if you want but I&#39;m in need of help.

thanks
