Mopar, do you know how much air resistance picks up after a certain speed? Do you know how hard it is to make a ROAD LEGAL car go 267MPH.</p>
<p>But wait, scientists for these MULTIBILLION £££ car manufacturers (Including Shelby supercars who briefly beat the bugatti till the SuperSport). STOP SPENDING MONEY, MOPARISTHEBEST HAS A SECRET YOU LOT CLEARLY DON’T KNOW ABOUT, YOU CAN BUILD A ROAD LEGAL CAR THAT BREAKS THE CURRENT WORLD RECORD FOR PRODUCTION CARS FOR ONLY $100k.</p>
<p>Volkswagen, koenigsegg, SSC, you and your scientists, billion £££ budgets are absolutely nothing. You need to contact <a href="mailto:mopar@moparisthebest.com">mopar@moparisthebest.com</a>, because he has a secret - he can build cars that are better than yours, that cost you millions each to make for only $100,000.</p>
<p>At the weight of the veyron, at the speeds it goes, at the fact it handles extremely well, there are no corners cut to make it go to 267MPH - it is a massive technical achievement. In comparison, it is easy to make a car go faster - but the aims of these cars are not just for speed, they’re for everything you’d find in a car within reason.</p>
<p>You’re deluded.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I think you misunderstood me, I didn’t say you could hire a team of engineers, buy all the hardware and test equipment, and design and build a car from scratch for under $100,000.  I said you could build one, using existing parts, for that or less.  All you need is a lot of torque, something that non-american cars don’t do very well.  For less than $15,000 I could build a carbureted, big-block american engine with somewhere around 1500 HP and more ft-lbs of torque.  (over 33% more than the veyron) That, mated to the right transmission, in any remotely aero-dynamic car could make 267mph as well.</p>
<p>Also, as I said before, a naturally aspirated american car running one carburetor on a small block (from wikipedia: 5.86 L (5,860 cc) (358 in³) Pushrod V8 engine) in the 80s did a lap at 218mph, obviously a little more work, newer technology, and more displacement on that car could easily do 267mph.[/quote]<br>
If that was the way to do it then companies would just do that. But the fact is they don’t because you cannot do it like that, and you cannot do it on the cheap along with it being road legal. You just can’t, sure you could just buy a car and stick a jets engine on it and im sure then you could break 267MPH but it wouldnt be road legal, or safe, or practical etc etc. You are extremely deluded if you think your american box shaped cars can go as fast as the veyron with a little tweaking. Like I said if they could then companies like bugatti would just do that instead and then their cars wouldnt cost exorbitent amounts.</p>

<p>They cost so much because people who buy them aren’t buying a car, they are buying a status symbol.  All a car like that tells you about a person is that they have more money than they know what to do with and are a giant asshole (because they could help people with that money, rather than burning it).</p>
<p>Also, I just showed you an american car that does 228 around a track with a meager, tiny engine that makes only about ~750hp.  It isn’t an F1 car or something, but a stock car that would only need lights to be street-legal.  Obviously it can be done easily in the price range I referred to, just because bugatti doesn’t want to do it that way doesn’t mean it can’t be done.</p>
<p>As an aside, Plymouth Roadrunners in the later part of the 60s were topping 200 on nascar tracks even back then, when they were actually road-legal stock cars.</p>

<p>I think you misunderstood me, I didn’t say you could hire a team of engineers, buy all the hardware and test equipment, and design and build a car from scratch for under $100,000.  I said you could build one, using existing parts, for that or less.  All you need is a lot of torque, something that non-american cars don’t do very well.  For less than $15,000 I could build a carbureted, big-block american engine with somewhere around 1500 HP and more ft-lbs of torque.  (over 33% more than the veyron) That, mated to the right transmission, in any remotely aero-dynamic car could make 267mph as well.</p>

<p>If that was the way to do it then companies would just do that. But the fact is they don’t because you cannot do it like that, and you cannot do it on the cheap along with it being road legal. You just can’t, sure you could just buy a car and stick a jets engine on it and im sure then you could break 267MPH but it wouldnt be road legal, or safe, or practical etc etc. You are extremely deluded if you think your american box shaped cars can go as fast as the veyron with a little tweaking. Like I said if they could then companies like bugatti would just do that instead and then their cars wouldnt cost exorbitent amounts.<br>

<p>They cost so much because people who buy them aren’t buying a car, they are buying a status symbol.

<p>Also, I just showed you an american car that does 228 around a track with a meager, tiny engine that makes only about ~750hp.  It isn’t an F1 car or something, but a stock car that would only need lights to be street-legal.

<p>If you actually watch the episodes with the standard veyron and the super sport… It would explain why its so hard to do 267mph in a road legal car… Its so do with the friction, they said for example… 40mph is like a knife through butter and then for 250mph its like going through a sponge cake. compare that with the knife through the butter and that is the simple way to explain that.</p>
<p>I thought a petrol head such as yourself you would of known that <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I understand the physics of it, and I’ve showed how you can do the same speed for far, far less money.  In an american car.[/quote]</p>

<p>No, an F1 car and a stock car are completely different things.  The F1 car’s wheels are all out in the open, and it has no bumpers for starters.  A stock car has both of those things.</p>

Well yeah, stick 10000000 feet of useless engine infront of any car and you’ll be fine, well - actually, that engine would probably come straight through your dash crushing you. Oh, and then you have the person you hit - the car or the pedestrian, they’d be worse off being hit by that large, heavy car.</p>
