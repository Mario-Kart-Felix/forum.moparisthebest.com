[size=12pt]&lt;blockquote&gt;-

24-01-12 - I have adding almost instant switching via ConnectionHandler and Packet.java
25-01-12 - Midterms..
26-01-12 - Perfect PvP Titles with Quest Tab Saving. PvP point system is complete!
27-01-12 - Made all shops created from scratch by me.
29-01-12 - Player updating is perfected! Tested with killstreak updating and players online updates with players logging in and out!
29-01-12 - Perfected PvP System so that it checks the ip, you cannot gain points using the same IP Adress
05-02-12 - 19-02-12 -
-- Updated Client
-- 474 data, with a 474 game frame. We wanted some items to be accessible in - game, but not all. Items such as godswords will not be in - game unless requested.



-- Updated context menus; they look much cleaner and organized.



-- Thanks to Aroused, we have finished Thieving.
-- Thieving area is at Ardougne, which is a nice, non-edited area for thieving. You can access it by thieving, and you get money depending on the level. 
-- Perfect animations, correct timers.



------
Combat Update:

Finished and perfected our PvP System Today!

This is how it works:

There are ranks that you show off, depending on how many kills you have. This rank is shown before your name to every player. Once you rank up, say at 25 kills, it will automatically update your rank, and it will tell you the new items you have unlocked. Items are unlocked from the PvP Store, not bought. Once you have the required amount of kills, you can obtain that item. PvP limits you from attacking the same IP. One small addition that I will make today is that you will not be allowed to trade or equip items that you do not have the required rank to equip!

Combat has been perfected!

Range max hit formula has been redone, and clipping is up and working. We have fixed up magic PvP, and melee has not been touched since it was already very good.

PvP Point Glitch - dying against npcs but gaining point has been fixed.

------
