    <title>Most effective fighting style?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/most-effective-fighting-style/226284</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve been thinking about this for the past few days. Which is the most effective fighting style, by fighting style I mean Karate, Muay Thai, Boxing, Judo, etc.

Well, I [b]PERSONALLY[/b] have come to the conclusion Muay Thai is, for anyone who doesn&#39;t know what that is it&#39;s an 8 point contact sport, involving knees, elbows, punches, fore-arms, kicks, clinches, shins, and take downs. I am not just saying this because I am a Thai boxer, but I have been doing a little bit of research and watching a few videos of where different fighting styles clash with each other and have it all out in a ring.

[b]Muay Thai vs Mixed Martial Arts -[/b]
     The Thai fighter would win because he has to be quick, and MMA fighters hold their gloves and hands so slow, and do not block. They                throw big arching punches, which is a big no. Now, you&#39;d probably think that the MMA fighter might take the Thai boxer down, and ground &amp; pound their way to victory. But, every Thai fighter is taught Brazilian Jui-Jitsu, and even a lot of MMA, as all Thai boxers are good in the clinch position. Every Thai fighter knows submission moves, and submission-defense. Overall the Thai fighter would be too quick for the MMA fighter.
[b]
Muay Thai vs Karate - [/b]
     Karate is a joke, and is not even considered a fighting style, rather a sport.

[b]Muay Thai vs Taek-won-do -[/b]
     Same as Karate, it is a sport. Too back my statement up, they put a Thai fighter against a Karate fighter. Here&#39;s the result: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbrYiy3Xe_A
[b]
Muay Thai vs Jui-Jitsu - [/b]
     Only way Jui-Jitsu would win in this situation would be if the Jui-Jitsu was able to put a submission move on the Thai fighter, seeing as Jui-Jitsu specializes in that. But, that goes without saying; Muay Thai fighters train for Jui-Jitsu too.

[b]Muay Thai vs Samba -[/b]
     Samba fighters do not have the fitness and endurance of a Thai fighter, due to their fights being so short. But, Samba is basically Muay Thai sped up 5 times.
[b]
Muay Thai vs Boxing -[/b]
     This would be the one that would be the fight to watch, due to the fighting styles being nearly identical. However, the Thai fighter would prevail just because boxers do not take hits on their legs/use their legs, which are definitly one of the most powerful things in a fighters arsenal. Also, elbows would be the decider in this fight.


Anyway, I can&#39;t be fucked to compare Thai to every fighting style, but those I have mentioned are definitely some of the most deadliest styles, other than Ninjitsu.

Also: watch this video, look at how many of the Knockouts are from Muay Thai, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0yuWhsCFWU.</description>

I probably would not hesitate to say it to their face, it’s true. Chuck Liddel is probably the only one that I know of in the UFC that actually has some decency about him, and is not a fucking idiot who walks around like he was born on the streets. As a result, he actually doesn’t have that bad of a striking game.</p>

MMA fighters are pathetic, well a lot of them. Their reflects are terrible, and have no “snap” about them. They’re not fluent with the punching. Only thing they know how to do is get punched in the face 50 times and some how still submit their opponent.</p>
