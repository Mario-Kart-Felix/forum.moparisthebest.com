    <description>I got 2problems.

problem 1: How can i make it when someone is fighting at edge someone else can&#39;t join in.
and when the person killed someone no one can attack him till 10seconds?

problem2: How can i make it like in rs  level 3 can only attack level 3.. and if they want to attack
example level 5 they need to go wildy 2.

if you help me with those 2 it will be so great.</description>
