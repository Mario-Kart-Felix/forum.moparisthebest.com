    <description>Does anyone know what the &#39;playerMaxHit&#39; is based on?..

Example:-

hitDiff = misc.random(playerMaxHit);

---

playerMaxHit.. Whats that calculated on, like what stat/bonus.. I found this..

[code]	
		int RangeBonus = playerBonus[5]; //Range Bonus
		int Range = playerLevel[4]; //Range		
MaxHit += (double)(1.05 + (double)((double)(RangeBonus * Range) * 0.00175));
		playerMaxHit = (int)Math.floor(MaxHit);
[/code]

Now that looks like its based on range.

-
I found this aswell..
[code]
		MaxHit += (getLevelForXP(playerXP[playerHitpoints]) - playerLevel[playerHitpoints])/2;
                }
		playerMaxHit = (int)Math.floor(MaxHit);
[/code]
 
Thats in the calculateMaxHit method. For str / atk / def types...

So exactly what am i basing the playerMaxHit on, when i use..
[code]

hitDiff = misc.random(playerMaxHit) + misc.random(2);
[/code]

I need something that actually bases it on the str level, str bonus, atk level + attacking bonuses..

If anyone would take up some of their time to help, you will be rewarded.

Thankz.</description>
