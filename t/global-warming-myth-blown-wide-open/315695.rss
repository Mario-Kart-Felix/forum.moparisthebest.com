<p>What you hear on TV, and read in magazines, are opinions based on data. Not facts based on data. Most theory’s can be proven, but something the size of global warming can’t because you can’t bring it back to ‘simple’ formulas. You end up with opinions being right or wrong, and those whose opinions were wrong will blame you because you misinterpreted them.</p>
<p>Whether global warming is real or not, it certainly would improve our air quality when we’d use resources such as the sun and wind instead of using oil. The problem is, <span class="bbcode-b">the US economy will collapse once we stop using oil</span>. The dollar is staying alive because it’s the currency oil is traded in. As long as there is oil trade, there will be a demand for dollars. As long as there is a demand for dollars, the US can print money to pay back it’s enormous debt. Once the dollar isn’t used for oil, or there is no oil trade, the US will have to buy foreign currency to pay it’s debt, which will increase prices in the US with all it’s consequences.</p>

Doesn’t necessarily indicate global warming/cooling, as most places rely on currents for their weather which could be affected by a variety of factors.</p>

<p>I don’t bother listening to anything I hear in the news about global warming anymore, they just keep changing their mind and contradicting each other. I can’t exactly make my own decision when I know nothing about the climate cycles of the earth, and have no reliable historical records of climate. It’s a problem for people in higher positions to sort out, not random people like us.</p>

 ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is an international nuclear fusion research and engineering megaproject, which will be the world's largest magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment. It is an experimental tokamak nuclear fusion reactor that is being built next to the Cadarache facility in Saint-Paul-lès-Durance, in Provence, southern France.
