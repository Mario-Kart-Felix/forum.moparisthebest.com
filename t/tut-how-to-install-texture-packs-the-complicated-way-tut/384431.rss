[code]http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?t=12352[/code]

::::NONE HD INSTRUCTIONS:::::

1 Next make a folder with a backup Minecraft.jar just incase you do it wrong or dislike the texture pack

2 name is BACKUPMINE

3 make another folder to contain the zip&#39;d files i dont care what you  name this one

4 Drag ONLY these listed files on to the Minecraft.jar in your roaming/.minecraft/bin folder (winrar may be needed to pack them into a jar file)
       - art
       - Gui (remove the arrow.png in it cuz it will f%%% up your game)
       - misc
       - terrain
       - Terrain.png
       - particles.png
if you dont have some of the files in the texture pack you downloaded then thats fine. means it does not require the extra files

5 once done Start the game and your done
