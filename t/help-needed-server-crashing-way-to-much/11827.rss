    <title>[Help Needed] Server crashing way to much</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-needed-server-crashing-way-to-much/11827</link>
    <description>hey guys. Im the owner of xlitescape. I need help because my server crashes wayto much and it pisses me off so bad lol :(. When i 1st opened the server.. it wouldnt crash unless someone did it on purpose. We only had about 15 members daily when the server opeend and no auto-save. Then server got bigger and had 30 members daily, so i added auto-save. Since i added auto-save server would crash more often then it used to.. Not alot.. but more often. Then server got really popular. About 50-60 members daily. Over the past couple days its been 50-60 members. Server has been crashing like every 10 min...7 min...8 min.. if i get lucky 20 min. 

A few reason why i think it might be crashing more often::
Computer old and slow
Auto-save
To many members

It really cant be my computer because when i 1st opened it, it was fast and no crashes.
Auto-save i think it is it and my coder does also, But i cant see how auto-save crashes it. And if i try to delet the autosave i get a few compile errors. And yes i tried multiple times to be careful to delet it but nothing
To many members, i think this is also the other reason, But i cant stop ppl from joining the server because if i set a low max members.. it will crash like every 3 min cuz everybody rushes on.

If anybody can help me figure out why or fix why or just sumthing. Because this isnt normal. Well thanks alot anyone who can help me and that contributes to my time. Thanks.. Danthemanx (Danny) =D</description>

              <p>danny does it have anything to do with T2 errors and your server being unable to find a player’s Vertex?</p>
<p>Becuase that happens to me A LOT now too. Maybe that’s the problem?</p>
