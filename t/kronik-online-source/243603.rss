    <description>RSCD based, I am the owner. I have decided to stop doing Servers officially now as I have more important things to do than sit a computer, no offense. But school and a social life is more important. My, This source, is incomplete unfortunately as i was almost finished for the release of the full server. So this is the release :D

[u]This server includes[/u]

[ul][li]The full source including client and source[/li]
[li]Various Tutorials on how to do some things to make your server up and running[/li]
[li]WWW files for your Wamp[/li]
[li]Lots of npcs, a bunch of commands and includes Godspells &amp; Theiving[/li]
[li]Custom made House on the top of Edgeville, Only for Staff![/li][/ul]


I would like to help all the people that helped me with my RSC problems and helped me with the server. Main shout outs;

Adu - Wouldn&#39;t be anywhere without you mate, you are the best guy ever and would like to thank you very much for all your help and all the time you spent helping me, I appreciate it.

Jammy - Thanks for spending your time and effort within the server and helping me with things aswell as Adu did. Keep up the good work mate!

Logan - Great guy always keen to get on the server to keep him un-bored, thanks for chillin with me bro. 

Note: I will [u]NOT[/u] be Helping anyone with this server and will not reply to questions regarding with things inside the server or anything to do with it.

Hope you enjoy the server and get further than I did!

<p>Reines - RSCD v2/v5/v25 - All if not most servers here are based on RSCD. Divine is pk edit of Demonik which is an edit of RSCD.<br>

<p>The reason why people like you fancy dummis for a god and kneel in front of him is that he was the only one who released his source, on the “moment”, aka this year’s march, when Mopar was running abit short of RSC server releases.[/quote]Where the fuck do you get your facts from? xEnt also made a vb6 server with hardly any features, and a c# server with lots of features. Also, bakatool made his own source way back when, and ephemeral made geminus, moonspell, glassdagger, rscdef and more. I’m pretty sure frank_ also made his own source too.</p>
