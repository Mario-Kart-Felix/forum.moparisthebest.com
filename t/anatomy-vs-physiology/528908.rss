    <title>Anatomy vs Physiology</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anatomy-vs-physiology/528908</link>
    <description>I have a test tomorrow in Anatomy, so I&#39;ve been studying over various different things. So far, the only thing that has caught my attention is function vs structure. Below is a list I have compiled together to label each phrase as either physiology or anatomy.

[b]Anatomy:[/b]

[ul][li]can be studied in dead specimen[/li]
	[li]principles of physics[/li]
	[li]observing a heart in action[/li]
	[li]dissection[/li]
	[li]directional terms[/li]
	[li]static[/li][/ul]

[b]Physiology:[/b]

[ul][li]dynamic[/li]
	[li]experimentation[/li]
	[li]observation[/li]
	[li]often studied in living subjects[/li]
	[li]chemistry principles[/li]
	[li]measuring the acid content of the stomach[/li][/ul]

If you have experience with Anatomy, please tell me if you think these terms fit in the right category.</description>

<p>isnt that physiology?</p>
<p>When I took A&amp;P they said anatomy was just about the layout of the body and where things were, whereas physiology was about how all of those things function[/quote]<br>
This is what we were taught, and I found a list on medial site to support the above categories. I do agree that the only thing that makes observing a heart physiology is the ‘action’ part. I’ll have to double check with my teacher tomorrow, because there are quite a few things that we have learned so far that seem contradictory. It’s amazing how one word can offset the entire phrase.</p>
<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
