    <title>Compile help/error with CheezScape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compile-help-error-with-cheezscape/25098</link>
    <description>Ok, so, I have CheezScape v80, and whenever I compile it, and runserver(I&#39;ve tried the file complie, then runserver, the file run&amp;compile), but any changes that I made NEVER happen ingame, it just stays the same as when i first extracted it from the zip.  I&#39;m thinking that maybe an error when it compiles causes it to do this, but I don&#39;t know.  Any help?

The error is:
[code]
client.java:5147: unreachable statement
if(item == 4708 &amp;&amp; playerLevel[13] &gt;= 85)
^
Note: stream.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:depracation for details.
1 error
Press any key to continue . . .
[/code]

If that has nothing to do with no changes ingame, can you tell me what I am doing wrong, and why my changes in client.java don&#39;t take effect after I compile and run the server?
I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s like this, This [i]is[/i] my first time with CheezScape though, and it is from Whitescape, I believe.  I always used Project16, so I&#39;m probobly doing something wrong when compiling.[br][size=1]Posted at: November 12, 2006, 03:20:31 PM[/size][hr]I&#39;m desperate here, Can someone help me?[br][size=1]Posted at: November 12, 2006, 08:32:03 PM[/size][hr]Does anyone out there know why my changes aren&#39;t going ingame after compiling?[br][size=1]Posted at: November 12, 2006, 10:43:10 PM[/size][hr]Sorry for being impatient, but the RS2 Server Development/Help page can&#39;t be found, So I&#39;m trying to have people read this as the latest topic.  So does anyone know how to help me?[br][size=1]Posted at: November 13, 2006, 12:15:43 AM[/size][hr]It&#39;s been a whole day...

Maybe someone will help me now since the forums were being retarded yesterday :D</description>

              <p>It has nothing to do with the compiler. Compiler is working fine but you have an error in client.java which needs to be fixed for the compiler to compile.</p>
