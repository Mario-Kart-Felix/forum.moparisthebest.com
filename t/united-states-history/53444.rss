          <blockquote>
              <p>Jefferson was a super liberal. He wrote the “Jefferson Bible” which replaced all mentions of “Man” with people etc… He also was a republican who was against strong federal power. He supported states rights. He believed the church and the government should be seperated.</p>
<p>Jefferson believed the federal government should handle foreign affairs, state governments domestic affairs.</p>
<blockquote>The Supreme Court in the case of Marbury v. Madison, which was decided during the first term of President Thomas Jefferson, determined that IT should make the final decision for all branches of government, and that opinion has remained in force ever since. Jefferson, however, strongly opposed Judicial Review because he thought it violated the principle of separation of powers. He proposed that each branch of government decide constitutional questions for itself, only being responsible for their decisions to the voters.</blockquote>
