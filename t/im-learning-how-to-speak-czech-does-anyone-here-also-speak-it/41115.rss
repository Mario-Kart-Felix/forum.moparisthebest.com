English isn’t a particularly easy language. In fact, I think it would be a bastard to learn.<br>
[/quote]<br>
So they say. Lucky me, I grew up in an all english speaking environment. And as far as I can tell going by posts on these boards, I’d say most other people here are from english speaking backgrounds… if anyone isn’t, they’re doing a good job so far. :P[/quote]<br>
Actually, English is a piece of cake compared to languages like Swedish (yuck!) and Finnish. For me it was no bitch to learn (well I’m still learning as you can see…). It’s pretty annoying to re-check from the dictionary the meaning of every tenth or so word though, only because every Finnish word has tens of different meanings in English and vice versa.</p>
<p>And on topic:<br>
If you are only going to visit Czech Republic, I could suggest only learning the very basic words like “thank you” and “hello” etc. Of course it’s up to you, if you want to learn a new language just because you’re visiting a new country, nothing stops you i suppose.</p>
