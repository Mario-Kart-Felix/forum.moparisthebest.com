Silab servers are based off of Czar, which is very poorly written. Czar sources are highly unstable at the moment.

Well when I used to host and that was last year back in summer I usually got 50 people plus on my server only hosting on moparscape and I had 1.5 gb of ram now I have 3gb of ram and btw I was using figment and it was 24/7 because I left my pc open then my pc broke because the motherboard burnt now i’ll try a more subtle approach[/quote]<br>
If I hosted, it would most likely be a VPS.</p>

what do you mean disrespectful would you rather join a server where you have to download the client or a silab srever which is safer I might throw in a trojan and some spyware to juice it up<br>
how would you know unless you scan it and mainly everyone on this fucktard forum thinks everyone is an angel looks like a good front page nice grammar pictures why not dl and the next day why the fuck is my internet going so slow?? quite weird eh and there’s nothing in y srever files except from run.bat lets see what happens if I click it you know I’m right</p>
