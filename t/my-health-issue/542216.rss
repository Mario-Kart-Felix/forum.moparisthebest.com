    <title>My health issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-health-issue/542216</link>
    <description>In order to get us on our own thread, and to stop derailing the &quot;IRL pictures of you&quot; thread, I&#39;ve taken most of the discussion and quoted it here.

[quote=&quot;sk8rdude461, post:8350, topic:277271&quot;]Edit: To make this post relevant.

Recently, idk why, I&#39;ve been losing weight. You may think it&#39;s a good thing, but it&#39;s not, at all. Not for my weight at least.
Here are some pics (no selfies tho)
My arm is at an odd angle because I wanted you all to see my entire side.
This is without my sucking my gut in.

This one is a bit nasty, just because of how deep it goes in. But here is what it looks like from the side when i suck my gut in.

The second picture of you sucking your gut in made me cringe, a little. :| Maybe it&#39;s time to go see a specialist. Not trying to be rude or anything.
[/quote]
The second pic is linked for that reason. I realized after uploading that it looks a bit gnarly.
But yeah, probably. I&#39;ve been to gastroenterologist (fudge that word) for it, and they made me drink that nasty ass barium shit.
[b]This is where they got ALL of their &#39;proof&#39; of what&#39;s wrong with me[/b]
So I went into the doctors the first time, and explained my situation about my stomach. My doctor said I should see a GI (gastroenterologist is some reason abbreviated to GI) specialist. So I made the appointment and all that. I wasn&#39;t allowed to eat/drink for 24 hours (so my stomach will be empty). I&#39;m in the room, they&#39;ve got the machine on my gut and all that jazz. I was given an option to make the liquid taste better by adding kool-aid (of fudgeing course i did). Make note that the kool-aid does not negate the taste much. It just adds a sweet flavor on top. I swallowed the first batch. The GI says &quot;Did you drink it?&quot; Me: &quot;Yeah.&quot; GI: &quot;We have to do it again because it went down too fast&quot; FML. After they make the second cup full, (with the kool aid) I drink it. I almost threw up that time, but I caught it.
However, on the xray shit, it showed the liquid go down into my stomach (There was a screen up in front of me to see it), and then come back up (the moment I regurgitated) a bit, then settle.
This is what made them think I have Acid Reflux, and that I need pills for that.
I told them that I almost threw up because that shit was nasty, but it was insisted that what they saw was acid reflux.

So yeah, that&#39;s the only specialist I&#39;ve seen for this so far.
I&#39;ve had 3 blood tests (for some reason they keep saying it&#39;s allergies), ^ that crap, and like I said before, the countless appointments with my doctor.[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Muroth, post:8355, topic:277271&quot;]Yeah, it tastes horrible I had to drink it. It&#39;s some sort of dye so they can see stuff better on the sceen. Did they see any problems health wise? If not I wouldn&#39;t worry about it too much. As long as you&#39;re healthy, that&#39;s all that really matters. 

To me it feels like they&#39;re on the right track but still haven&#39;t figured out exactly what&#39;s wrong.[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Newty, post:8360, topic:277271&quot;][quote author=Pwnd link=topic=365944.msg4419355#msg4419355 date=1397628837]
Tape worm
[/quote]

Seriously you need to push the doctor in that direction so he will check for it.[/quote]
*She
And like I said, the appetite/eating shit didn&#39;t start till after the pills.
The last time I went to the doctors, I tried to describe to her my most recent idea on what the problem could be. Basically, my grandpa and I were thinking there&#39;s something wrong with whatever prevents food from going into the lungs (or the tubes leading into them). It seemed reasonable, since when I smoke (pot, if you don&#39;t already know. This right here is one of my many reasons I smoke, as it helps me eat) there will be times that even though I didn&#39;t swallow (I don&#39;t know how many people here are smokers, but the ones that are will get this), I&#39;ll still get that nasty burning burp where you burp up smoke.

I think a lot of you are misguided as to what the issue may be because you see that I&#39;m skinny, and said that I&#39;m having trouble eating. I&#39;ve always been skinny, there was never a time where I was fat.

[b]The actual health issue[/b]
Basically - (what I believe is happening) There will be times (no, there are no specific times. I&#39;ve tried not eating specific foods, etc, it&#39;s rather sporadic and random) when I&#39;m eating that the food won&#39;t go down all the way and it just sort of gets stuck. Well then any food that I&#39;d eat after it needs to go somewhere, and if it can&#39;t go down, it goes up. No, it&#39;s not vomiting, nor is it projectile vomiting. I regurgitate the food, along with a lot of phlegm (a.k.a mucus). Sometimes, I&#39;ll be trying to cough or push the food up that&#39;s stuck, and it will cause me to spit up stomach acid, and I can feel the burn of that (This happens when I haven&#39;t ate recently and food gets stuck as I&#39;ve just started eating).

I&#39;ve tried:
Mucinex (to get rid of the mucus)
Allergy meds (again ^)
Acid reflux pills (as per my doctors orders)
Eating healthier (caused me to lose more weight. did nothing else.)
Probiotics (my doctor thought maybe my digestive system was bonkers)</description>

Sounds similar to a problem I am having concerning weight loss. I’ve had about 10 blood tests, at first the problem was that I was anemic (which was a result of low hemoglobin in my blood). I was in the hospital for a few days, and I have also been referred to a gastroenterologist (or GI, as you would put it) and I am still waiting on my appointment. I understand how difficult it is coping with this illness, I was constantly fatigued, making work very difficult. Anyway, best of luck getting better. I hope for your sake it’s nothing too serious <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p>I think I’m gonna try to continue to work out and waste energy, so that way hopefully my body is like “hey i need food for energy” lol.</p>
<p>Also, has anyone ever had it where you get real hungry, and then a few minutes later it go away? that always happens to me. I’ll be hungry for like 5 minutes and not be hungry anymore.</p>

Being skinny isn’t the full issue (totally okay with being skinny, always have been). It’s the issue that’s causing me to lose more weight, making it a heal risk. And the only thing I smoke is weed. I used to drink more casually, but recently my stomach has been reacting to it so I’ve had to stop.</p>

That hurt you’re feeling is probably the muscles you haven’t worked in a while. That’s a good sign, its not meant to tickle after a workout :P[/quote]<br>
Nah I was working out for like 3 weeks (every 2 days or so) before that, I think I just hurt myself like a dumbass.</p>

<p>Recently, idk why, I’ve been losing weight. You may think it’s a good thing, but it’s not, at all. Not for my weight at least.<br>
Here are some pics (no selfies tho)<br>
My arm is at an odd angle because I wanted you all to see my entire side.<br>
This is without my sucking my gut in.</p>

<p>This one is a bit nasty, just because of how deep it goes in. But here is what it looks like from the side when i suck my gut in.<br>

The second picture of you sucking your gut in made me cringe, a little. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> Maybe it’s time to go see a specialist. Not trying to be rude or anything.<br>
[/quote]<br>
The second pic is linked for that reason. I realized after uploading that it looks a bit gnarly.<br>
But yeah, probably. I’ve been to gastroenterologist (fudge that word) for it, and they made me drink that nasty ass barium shit.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">This is where they got ALL of their ‘proof’ of what’s wrong with me</span><br>
So I went into the doctors the first time, and explained my situation about my stomach. My doctor said I should see a GI (gastroenterologist is some reason abbreviated to GI) specialist. So I made the appointment and all that. I wasn’t allowed to eat/drink for 24 hours (so my stomach will be empty). I’m in the room, they’ve got the machine on my gut and all that jazz. I was given an option to make the liquid taste better by adding kool-aid (of fudgeing course i did). Make note that the kool-aid does not negate the taste much. It just adds a sweet flavor on top. I swallowed the first batch. The GI says “Did you drink it?” Me: “Yeah.” GI: “We have to do it again because it went down too fast” FML. After they make the second cup full, (with the kool aid) I drink it. I almost threw up that time, but I caught it.<br>
However, on the xray shit, it showed the liquid go down into my stomach (There was a screen up in front of me to see it), and then come back up (the moment I regurgitated) a bit, then settle.<br>
This is what made them think I have Acid Reflux, and that I need pills for that.<br>
I told them that I almost threw up because that shit was nasty, but it was insisted that what they saw was acid reflux.</p>
<p>So yeah, that’s the only specialist I’ve seen for this so far.<br>
I’ve had 3 blood tests (for some reason they keep saying it’s allergies), ^ that crap, and like I said before, the countless appointments with my doctor.[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote=“Muroth, post:8355, topic:277271”]Yeah, it tastes horrible I had to drink it. It’s some sort of dye so they can see stuff better on the sceen. Did they see any problems health wise? If not I wouldn’t worry about it too much. As long as you’re healthy, that’s all that really matters.</p>
<p>To me it feels like they’re on the right track but still haven’t figured out exactly what’s wrong.[/quote]</p>

Tape worm<br>

<p>Seriously you need to push the doctor in that direction so he will check for it.[/quote]<br>
*She<br>
And like I said, the appetite/eating shit didn’t start till after the pills.<br>
The last time I went to the doctors, I tried to describe to her my most recent idea on what the problem could be. Basically, my grandpa and I were thinking there’s something wrong with whatever prevents food from going into the lungs (or the tubes leading into them). It seemed reasonable, since when I smoke (pot, if you don’t already know. This right here is one of my many reasons I smoke, as it helps me eat) there will be times that even though I didn’t swallow (I don’t know how many people here are smokers, but the ones that are will get this), I’ll still get that nasty burning burp where you burp up smoke.</p>
<p>I think a lot of you are misguided as to what the issue may be because you see that I’m skinny, and said that I’m having trouble eating. I’ve always been skinny, there was never a time where I was fat.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The actual health issue</span><br>
Basically - (what I believe is happening) There will be times (no, there are no specific times. I’ve tried not eating specific foods, etc, it’s rather sporadic and random) when I’m eating that the food won’t go down all the way and it just sort of gets stuck. Well then any food that I’d eat after it needs to go somewhere, and if it can’t go down, it goes up. No, it’s not vomiting, nor is it projectile vomiting. I regurgitate the food, along with a lot of phlegm (a.k.a mucus). Sometimes, I’ll be trying to cough or push the food up that’s stuck, and it will cause me to spit up stomach acid, and I can feel the burn of that (This happens when I haven’t ate recently and food gets stuck as I’ve just started eating).</p>
<p>I’ve tried:<br>
Mucinex (to get rid of the mucus)<br>
Allergy meds (again ^)<br>
Acid reflux pills (as per my doctors orders)<br>
Eating healthier (caused me to lose more weight. did nothing else.)<br>
Probiotics (my doctor thought maybe my digestive system was bonkers)</p>
