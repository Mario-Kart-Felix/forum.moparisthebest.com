    <title>Need Help with Dupe [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-dupe-pi/543189</link>
    <description>Okay so I logged into my server today, and my players informed me that one of my staff members was duping. I&#39;m not sure how it was performed but they said he was just standing in edgeville and was continuosly re-logging. Some how he managed to get items that weren&#39;t even available to the server like a Christmas Cracker... and 2.1B of them... His accounts were banned aswell as his ip. Any idea how he was doing it? Or what duping method he was using?

EDIT: It was not the cheatengine + store dupe or cheatengine + duel arena dupe, i know they are fixed</description>

<p>You need better packet validation. Never trust anything that comes in from the client. For example global drops add them all into a list and make sure when that player picks it up it’s inside of that list. Another example would be with interfaces make sure every time someone opens an interface you have some sort of check like a Boolean or a listener to make sure that the player has actually opened an interface.[/quote]</p>
