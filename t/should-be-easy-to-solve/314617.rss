    <title>Should be easy to solve?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-be-easy-to-solve/314617</link>
    <description>[b]I have just 5 minutes ago got my server online. And now I am faced of the fact that new-members are upset because they have to be online for 60 minutes until they can drop or trade.

I am not happy about this either and am wondering, how can i lower this limit?, or even better, delete this rule altogeather?

Thanks. Dillon. :D[/b]</description>

<p>i had this in one of my sources.<br>
when you try to drop a item, it should send a message that you cant.<br>
in client class, search for part of the message and delete the thing, do it for trade as well.</p>
