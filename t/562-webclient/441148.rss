    <title>[562] Webclient?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-webclient/441148</link>
    <description>[center][b]~[562] WEBCLIENT~[/b]
 :wink: 
It would be amazing if someone could help me out:

[i]I am currently hosting a [562] RSPS, and I want to upload a webclient.

I have no idea how to make one and looked at many tutorials on how to and never could find out how. I&#39;m looking for someone that can make one for me?[/i]

[b]The download link to the [562] Client is here:[/b]
[url=http://up.ht/JnDO70]Client Download[/url]

[u]If you can manage to make me one in a .jar file, I&#39;m not asking you to upload it, I&#39;m asking you to make me a jar&#39;d file of the client that works with just the .jar file.[/u]

I&#39;ll give you Staff on the server and make signatures, avatars, or anything you want in return.

[i]I just need a webclient and fast. PM me if you want more info.[/i]
