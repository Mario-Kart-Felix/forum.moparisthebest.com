    <description>Hey guys,

Ive been watching heaps of vids on youtube but i just got a few questions before i start.

What is the best &quot;Game source&quot; to use.  Eg - allstar is something. And can you give me the download link to it.

I have downloaded WINRAR, but if i download the SOURCE, do i still need the moperscape client??

Because i want to change admin permissions are stuff, however i know how to do that?

So overall, whats all the stuff i need. And what the best server to use and to change. And download link.

Thanks.</description>

              <p>ok if i was you i wont use allstar’s base because that is just shit now same with delta but since u r a beginner i would use delta to start off and that so go to the download section and look for a 317 server that you like most likely it would be delta and then download the source and client that come’s with it that should help u out.</p>
