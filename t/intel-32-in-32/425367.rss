    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Make a video explaining in 32 seconds or less why you deserve your very own 32 nanometer, Intel unlocked processor-based PC. Upload your video to Vimeo or YouTube, then post the link below. Our judges will review entries and award the best video the grand prize in the 32 in 32 Challenge.

Videos will be judged based upon:

Creativity
Style
Audio and Video Quality (We want to be able to hear, and see you.)
Duration (Keep it close to 32 seconds)
You have until 11:59 PM PST on Thursday, December 15 to submit your video link.

WIN AN ULTIMATE UNLOCKED PACKAGE

Best video submission wins airfare for 2 to NewEgg&#39;s home offices to hand-select and build an unstoppable Intel 32nm Unlocked processor-based gaming rig.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

you enter thru facebook i believe. i got this info from there. I would record a video but i really don&#39;t know what i would say in it. but that would be so awesome to win, I dont think i would have fps lag again(or at least for a few years). that is if winning means you get to choose from any product newegg has available to use in building the gaming rig no matter the price.</description>
