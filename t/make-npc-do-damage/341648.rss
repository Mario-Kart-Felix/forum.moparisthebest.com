              <p>All is done in NPCHandler.java<br>
If you want to make ranged npc add case ID: after this code:<br>
[/code]	public int getDistanceForNpc(int Npc) {<br>
switch(npcs[Npc].npcType) {[/code]<br>
If you want to make aggressive npc add case ID: after this code:</p>
<p><code>	public boolean npcGetsAnnoyed(int Npc) {
		switch(npcs[Npc].npcType) {</code><br>
Set NPC defense in after this code:</p>
<p><code>		if (player != null) {
			int def = player.playerBonus[6] + player.playerLevel[1];
			int rand = misc.random(def);
			int rand_npc = misc.random(combatLevel[NPCID]);</code></p>
<p><code>			if (npcs[NPCID].npcType == 2) { // This sets which NPC for example Man
				rand_npc = misc.random(1);// this sets the amount of Def for example 1</code></p>
<p>Set NPC max hit/ratio after this code:</p>
<p><code>			// println("rand_npc=" + rand_npc + ", rand=" + rand);
			if (rand_npc &gt; rand) {</code></p>
<p><code>			if (npcs[NPCID].npcType == 87) { // this sets the NPC for example Rat.
				hitDiff = misc.random(2);//This sets the amount of damage it inflicts.
			}</code></p>
<p>Now for multiple attacks.<br>
Look for this code:</p>
<p><code>
		if ((GoodDistance(npcs[NPCID].absX, npcs[NPCID].absY, EnemyX, EnemyY, 1) == true) || (GoodDistance(npcs[NPCID].absX, npcs[NPCID].absY, EnemyX, EnemyY, 8) == true) &amp;&amp; (npcs[NPCID].npcType == 2743) ||  (GoodDistance(npcs[NPCID].absX, npcs[NPCID].absY, EnemyX, EnemyY, 8) == true) &amp;&amp; (npcs[NPCID].npcType == 2745) || (GoodDistance(npcs[NPCID].absX, npcs[NPCID].absY, EnemyX, EnemyY, 8) == true) &amp;&amp; (npcs[NPCID].npcType == 2631)) {
			if (npcs[NPCID].actionTimer == 0) {
				if (false &amp;&amp; (EnemyHP &lt;= (int) ((double) ((double) EnemyMaxHP / 10.0) + 0.5))) {
				} else {
					if (server.playerHandler.players[Player].deathStage &gt; 0) {
						ResetAttackPlayer(NPCID);
					} else {</code><br>
After it you should see a lot of If/else codes, in there NPCS are set to multiple attacks.</p>
<p><code>
/////////////						
} else if (npcs[NPCID].npcType == 3303 &amp;&amp; misc.random(2)== 1 &amp;&amp; !plr.ProtMage) {//this sets the npc if random between 2 is equal to 1 then and if it doesn't use magic prayer protection it will will hit the amount of damage is set.
npcs[NPCID].animNumber = 0000;// this is animation number that will be set when the attack is done.
hitDiff = 20 + misc.random(25); //this is the amount of damage it inflicts (min 20 + 1 to 25 damage)   
plr.specGFX(000);// GFX number that will be set when NPC attacks
                                    } else if(npcs[NPCID].npcType == 3303 &amp;&amp; plr.ProtMage) {If player is using magic prayer protection then it will inflict this damage that is set.
npcs[NPCID].animNumber = 3146;// this is animation number that will be set when the attack is done.
hitDiff = misc.random(20);  //this is the amount of damage it inflicts (from 0 to 20 damage) 
plr.specGFX(346);// GFX number that will be set when NPC attacks
                        } else if(npcs[NPCID].npcType == 3303 &amp;&amp; misc.random(2)==1 &amp;&amp; !plr.ProtMelee) {//this sets the npc if random between 2 is equal to 1 then and if it doesn't use melee prayer protection it will will hit the amount of damage is set.
                                             npcs[NPCID].animNumber = 3146;// this is animation number that will be set when the attack is done.
hitDiff = 20 + misc.random(55);  //this is the amount of damage it inflicts (min 20 + from 0 to 55 damage) 
                        } else if(npcs[NPCID].npcType == 3303 &amp;&amp; misc.random(2)==1 &amp;&amp; plr.ProtMelee) {If player is using melee prayer protection then it will inflict this damage that is set.
npcs[NPCID].animNumber = 3146;// this is animation number that will be set when the attack is done.
hitDiff = misc.random(20);   //this is the amount of damage it inflicts (from 0 to 20 damage)
/////////////</code><br>
