    <title>Scar and DirectX</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/scar-and-directx/3886</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sure many of you are aware of how scar does not work with directx games(colors change everytime you move), but I have a few questions about that:

- Would scar still work on a 2D directx game? Such as maple story? 

- Does it only account for 3D models? Or does it just not work on ANYTHING directx related? 

- Is it be possible to create scripts for maple story?

Thanks, and &lt;3 to anyone who replies :D

              <p>Alright, thats as good as an answer I needed.</p>
<p>There is a general game cheating forum that I hang around(and that I am a mod on) of 34k members, and the sad part is that I am one of their smartest members(I know, it’s shocking). There is only like 5-6 other members there with some decent brains, and they wanted my help to create a maple story script since macroing doesnt seem to be much of a problem(hacking is though) so you probably wouldn’t get banned easily. I told them scar doesn’t work with directx etc… But I thought I’d ask about it about it here.</p>
