Im nice so I have figured this out by playing around a bit so I will tell u guys idk if it will be taken down since its supposed to be me getting helped but ill tell u anyways

For brighter Inventory go to client folder and go to itemdef.java and search for model.method479(66 + anInt196, 450 + anInt184, -50, -10, -50, true); 
Yours wont be exactly like mine because i have changed it but I left mine like this because it was the brightness I liked but if you would like play around with it.

Now to make your character brighter go into client folder and find player.java remember this is not server sided and search model_1.method479 replace that line with this model_1.method479(frontLight, backLight, rightLight, middleLight, leftLight, true); and add these ints 
[code]public int frontLight = 90;
	public int backLight = 820;
	public int rightLight = 0;
	public int middleLight = -1; // Cannot be 0
	public int leftLight = 0;[/code]</description>
