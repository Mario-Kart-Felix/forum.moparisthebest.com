    <description>
[ul]Hey,

     I know I make great iced coffee. I&#39;ve had friends call at 6 in the morning because they needed a glass of it, and they even picked me up from 10 miles away lol. So, I share my secrets without my favorite community. Have fun =)

For this amazing drink you will need:
[list]
[li]About a half a pot of black coffee, try to make it a little warmer than lukewarm.[/li]
[li]6 or 7 Ice Cubes[/li]
[li]A Blender[/li]
[li]Milk/Creamer/Half and Half (Creamer is best, but half and half is ok)[/li]
[li]2-4 Sugar packets (optional if you used creamer or half and half)[/li]
[li]If you used milk, and have no sugar, honey is a must[/li]
[li]Vanilla Extract (optional)[/li]
[li]Coco or Chocolate powder(optional)[/li]
[li]Whipped Cream (optional)[/li][/list]

Ok, now let&#39;s get started. It&#39;s a pretty easy procedure to follow, so you shouldn&#39;t have any problems.

1. Put the coffee in to about 1/4 of the blender. Then add the sugar or honey and milk if your only using milk. If not using milk, add the creamer or half and half.The color after adding any type of liquid should be a light tan, about that color is perfect. Also, if using honey, add about a regular spoon full or two. At this point, also add as much vanilla extract as you see fit. I usually turn the bottle over for about a second and a half 2 times.

2. Once you have all that in, put the top back on the blender and blend it for about 5 seconds. After this add the ice cubes. You may want to more than 6 or 7, and thats ok. Experiment. Blend this for about 30 seconds or so on the highest setting. If you do any less than there will be chunks of ice, not very nice. Also, if you used honey then make sure theres not little specks of it.

3. Pour into a glass or mug. If you have the whipped cream, fill the top with it, and then put the put the cocoa or chocolate powder on the whipped cream.

4. Enjoy, this drink doesn&#39;t even taste like coffee and makes about 2-3 Glasses. For me. Also, when pouring a new glass, make sure to blend for 1-2 seconds to get everything mixed up again because the coffee tends to fall to the bottom of the blender while the ice and other ingredients stay on top.

I hope you like it. I made it at my friends house once when we all had to go to school in 3 hours and we&#39;d been at the graveyard all night. We stayed up and I even did my school work because my hands were shaking and I [i]had[/i] to do something. Please leave feedback.[/ul]</description>

              <p>Thanks, I’ll go with the Hazelnut then. Although, have you ever thought of using a different type of ice? It’s better to use the Bags of Ice you buy at a store, or Mini-Mart.</p>

              <p>I’ve been drinking Coffee since I was 10. And, I’ve had many types of Coffee, but, by far the Way I like my coffee the most is Black. Now sometimes I enjoy a mocha Latte here and there, but It’s always better when it’s the strong, and hot. I may try this right now it’s almost daylight, I might as well. Do you suggest using any specific blend of coffee? If you don’t have a specific one, I’ll just use some Hazelnut French roast or something.</p>

[li]Coco or Chocolate powder(optional)[/li]<br>
[li]Whipped Cream (optional)[/li][/list]</p>
<p>Ok, now let’s get started. It’s a pretty easy procedure to follow, so you shouldn’t have any problems.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Put the coffee in to about 1/4 of the blender. Then add the sugar or honey and milk if your only using milk. If not using milk, add the creamer or half and half.The color after adding any type of liquid should be a light tan, about that color is perfect. Also, if using honey, add about a regular spoon full or two. At this point, also add as much vanilla extract as you see fit. I usually turn the bottle over for about a second and a half 2 times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have all that in, put the top back on the blender and blend it for about 5 seconds. After this add the ice cubes. You may want to more than 6 or 7, and thats ok. Experiment. Blend this for about 30 seconds or so on the highest setting. If you do any less than there will be chunks of ice, not very nice. Also, if you used honey then make sure theres not little specks of it.</p>

<li>
<p>Pour into a glass or mug. If you have the whipped cream, fill the top with it, and then put the put the cocoa or chocolate powder on the whipped cream.</p>

<p>Enjoy, this drink doesn’t even taste like coffee and makes about 2-3 Glasses. For me. Also, when pouring a new glass, make sure to blend for 1-2 seconds to get everything mixed up again because the coffee tends to fall to the bottom of the blender while the ice and other ingredients stay on top.</p>

We stayed up and I even did my school work because my hands were shaking and I <span class="bbcode-i">had</span> to do something. Please leave feedback.[/ul]</p>
