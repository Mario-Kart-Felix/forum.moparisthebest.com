    <description>[code]Make sure your story deals with something that could happen in real life.  Your story may be completely fictional, or you may write a story about something that actually happened to you or to someone you know.   If you wish, you may use fake names even if the story is true.
Make sure your plot contains a series of events with a specific beginning, middle, and end.  
Make sure your story includes detailed description of the setting (where and when the story takes place), the characters (the people involved), and the plot (the events that happened). 
If your characters talk to teach other, include properly paragraphed and punctuated dialogue. 
Use a consistent point of view; either first person or third person. 
Use a literary device such as foreshadowing, flashback, symbolism, allusion, irony, or conceit.[/code]

              <p>For my english papers I found that reading short stories from specific authors really helped when writing a story 'cause I could kind of use their style and then change it a little bit depending on what the story was about.</p>
<p>Your task is pretty open and easy to do, seeing as you can write about almost anything. I’m not sure if you have read any of Edgar Allen Poe’s short stories. If you’re in to gothic/creepy stories with a very particular writing style, I’d reccomend trying to imitate him.</p>
<p>I assume you’re dead line’s probably been and gone by now, but if you need any particular help, just send me a PM because for me, creative writing is pretty enjoyable, so i’m more than happy to help.</p>

              <p>think about something significant that’s happened in your life, something you remember vividly that was either exciting/scary/sad. writing about personal things that have happened to you really help the emotion jump from the page, and help the words flow, especially if you remember how you were feeling at the time. - just close your eyes, and go back there.</p>
<p>just figure out a starting line in retrospect to the situation and go from there, eg;</p>
<p>“My heart was beating like a drum in my chest;”<br>
“I couldn’t believe what I was seeing;”<br>
“MY MUM’S A CUNT;”</p>
<p>just shit like that.</p>
