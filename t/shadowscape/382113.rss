    <description>[center][size=14pt]Shadowscape[/size][/center]

Yes Shadowscape my now in development RSC server. I Mason and a few close friends are working on it, probably as you read this.  We have on major goal,  we are in the process of coding our server to have 2 worlds a PKing world and a Normal world (which includes all quests etc).

The PKing world will not be set out like RSC at all but a few &quot;Arenas&quot; Just for fighting.  A training area to get your stats to what you want them to be (X10 xp).  And at each arena a few people to get resources from.

The normal world will be set out like RSC with all it&#39;s quests, NPCs and items (Including some stuff of our own).  So it will be like playing a new version of RSC that is hopefully better than the old.  Don&#39;t worry xp systems and major things will stay the same.

The catch is the PKing world and Normal world will be linked by your username and that is all.  With the one username you can log onto both worlds but the items, skills and experience are World based only.  So you can PK on one and enjoy the old style of RSC on the other.

Some additional features will be added to both worlds.

These include:

[ul][li]New Monsters[/li]
[li]New Items[/li]
[li]New Quests[/li]
[li]New Places[/li]
[li]New Spells[/li]
[li]New Prayer Items[/li]
[li]A revision of the combat system to make it look more fluid[/li][/ul]


Those are just some of the improvements that will be made.  Another one that I thought should be noted separately is gangs like the Phoenix gang in Varrock.  Except these gangs will let you do quests are climb ranks.  (Gang specific weapons and armour maybe?)


So what does everyone think.  This is just a rough idea of what is going to happen and will be changed often.  Any Ideas, thoughts, or suggestions?

And criticism and advice is welcomed.</description>

              <p>We were thinking about that but in the end decided it would be easier to use a pre made source.  It will save us time in the long run and already includes a few things that we will then not have to add ourselves.</p>

              <p>^Well we want this to feel like RSC but an updated version of it.  So to get rid of stuff that was already there would destroy the feel.  But for all we know we might change our minds and actually do that.  It is a good suggesting and we will have to think over it.  It does seem like a good idea.  But we really do want to keep the RSC feel.  RS2 quests will be added.  Not all just some, like sheep herder wont be added that is a terrible quest that has no real purpose in RS2.  The quests we are making from scratch actually tie into the whole runescape history very nicely.  Using current gods/NPCs (and new ones) and stories that are in place but going into the depth you can’t find in the real runescape.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion and we will seriously consider it.</p>

new ones, I think it’d be a best a better use of time. I wouldn’t wanna do the same quest all over again. I would prob just play to do a quest I haven’t done before on rsc. Also I know scripting a quest would be hard, but you could copy an rs2 quest that wasn’t on rsc and translate it to rsc.</p>

              <p>Well thanks for the support everyone.  We wont be able to upload screenshots for a while unfortunately as we are still just coding some new features in. Yes we are keeping to all the quests as accurately as possible.  All added areas will either be underground or in new places.  Also we have taken into consideration weapon balancing.  We haven’t decided what they will be called yet but we made the decision that the new items will be based for all different levels and player types.  So there will be low level weapons and high level weapons.  But the new high level weapons will be associated with a new quest or two.</p>
<p>For the work side we have 5 people on our team at the moment and a few more friends are interested.  Trevor is currently working on a 3D area editor to help us in our efforts and making new areas alot quicker and easier.  We are working on it for at least an hour or two a day each and when we can much longer.</p>
<p>For a bit of fun we decided that it would bee okay to tell you of some new monsters we are planning on adding.</p>
<p>[ul][li]Wyverns (lvl 12,35,50,78,90)[/li]<br>
[li]Golems (lvl 40,62,66,72) Made from a sorcerer made from human corpses[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Also the gang system is under work now.  All major cities will have a “Hidden” base of operations.  Missions will include recovering items to helping out higher ranked members (NPCs).  We are also adding player made gangs given to the top 3 players in the game or admin.</p>
<p>A GUI for mods and admin is being added so they can change players (ban,mute,increase/decrease levels,kick,teleport,add/remove items (to bank or inventory).  Mods wont have all those controls but they will have some.</p>
<p>In Progress:<br>
GUI for Mods/Admin<br>
Quests<br>
3D area editor<br>
World System<br>
Gangs</p>
<p>To be done:<br>
Additional Weapons<br>
Additional Quests<br>
Additional Areas<br>
Additional NPCs</p>
<p>Our blogspot might be up soon for updates on our progress we wont be making the website until it is in beta.</p>

              <p>First of all, i’d like to say good luck. Nice to see new people around here and developing new things before releasing unedited sources.</p>
<p>It sounds like a big project, and will be time consuming. There’s a lot of quests alone, which will be very time consuming, especially if you are looking to replicate them as near to the real RSC as possible?</p>
<p>Also, make sure if you’re adding in new items (weapons and armour), that you do a lot of combat testing against players and NPCs to balance out attributes accordingly. Having overpowered items will ruin things, as seen in DARscape with the hideous Diamond Dragon items, or whatever they were called.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how many people, or how much free time you actually have to spend on this project, but if you have any questions, give me a shout and I will try provide help wherever I can. My time is quite limited, but I will answer any questions ASAP, and will check my inbox at least once each day.</p>
<p>Good luck, and don’t forget to keep people informed of the progress.</p>

<p>Yes Shadowscape my now in development RSC server. I Mason and a few close friends are working on it, probably as you read this.  We have on major goal,  we are in the process of coding our server to have 2 worlds a PKing world and a Normal world (which includes all quests etc).</p>
<p>The PKing world will not be set out like RSC at all but a few “Arenas” Just for fighting.  A training area to get your stats to what you want them to be (X10 xp).  And at each arena a few people to get resources from.</p>
<p>The normal world will be set out like RSC with all it’s quests, NPCs and items (Including some stuff of our own).  So it will be like playing a new version of RSC that is hopefully better than the old.  Don’t worry xp systems and major things will stay the same.</p>
<p>The catch is the PKing world and Normal world will be linked by your username and that is all.  With the one username you can log onto both worlds but the items, skills and experience are World based only.  So you can PK on one and enjoy the old style of RSC on the other.</p>
<p>Some additional features will be added to both worlds.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<p>[ul][li]New Monsters[/li]<br>
[li]New Items[/li]<br>
[li]New Quests[/li]<br>
[li]New Places[/li]<br>
[li]New Spells[/li]<br>
[li]New Prayer Items[/li]<br>
[li]A revision of the combat system to make it look more fluid[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Those are just some of the improvements that will be made.  Another one that I thought should be noted separately is gangs like the Phoenix gang in Varrock.  Except these gangs will let you do quests are climb ranks.  (Gang specific weapons and armour maybe?)</p>
<p>So what does everyone think.  This is just a rough idea of what is going to happen and will be changed often.  Any Ideas, thoughts, or suggestions?</p>
<p>And criticism and advice is welcomed.</p>
