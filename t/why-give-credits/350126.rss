    <description>Ok, i see people releasing there client/source things. And then there always a smart ass who says.

&quot;Oh, I think deltascape deserves more credit&quot;

Well honestly, all the credit should really go to Jagex retard....

Next time you think of comment on someones &quot;Credits&quot;

Remember who really gave birth to this game...

Jagex does not deserve credits for anything server sided. The client is theres and the server is ours. The <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">only</span></span> thing you can possibly give credits for server side is the Stream class because it was ripped directly out of the client.[/quote]<br>

<p>Nope, it’s still possible to write your own.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>And no point in giving Jagex credits. First off, other than the Stream and Cryption classes, they did nothing server-sided. Second, everybody already knows Jagex made the client and it’s just something that serves no purpose to be pointed out.</p>

<p>As for the credits issue. Credits should only be issued to people who have made a major impact on the source you’re using. Know your source and know its history or you might be flamed.</p>
<p>Also, please refrain from posting percentages in your credits. All those statistics are inaccurate, simply add their names and possibly a small comment.</p>
