    <title>Need a RSPS developer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-rsps-developer/441291</link>
    <description>To whom is reading , Myself and a friend are looking into starting up a Runescape Private Server ( RSPS ) one of which we hope will become a great success.
 
We are looking at hiring a highly experienced coder ( Java ) someone who can provide proof of previous projects , We fully understand that this could be a very time consuming project.
 
We will be offering a substantial payment as well as a percentage of all future profits ( assuming that you stay around to add - fix stuff when deemed necessary)
 
We are intent on gaining a substantial financial income as well as creating a large friendly player community.
 
We will discuss source etc when we are at that stage.
 
We are only looking at hiring the utmost experienced and determined coder(s).
 
Thank you.
