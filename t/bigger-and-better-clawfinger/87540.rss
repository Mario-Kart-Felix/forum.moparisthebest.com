Nobody is perfect but I&#39;m pretty fucking close
and I&#39;m here to give you all a heavy heavenly dose
I think you&#39;d better listen &#39;cos I know who you are
and I think that you should treat me like a superstar
because I&#39;m more than just a human I&#39;m a gift to all of you
and I&#39;m here to make sure that my message gets through
I wonder if you&#39;re really all as dumb as you look
or are you smart enough to learn the rules in my book
I hope you understand that the knowledge I bring
puts me in the position of a god or a king
&#39;cos I&#39;m blessed with the gift of the magic touch
and I wouldn&#39;t say that I&#39;m asking for to much
all you have to do is get down on your knees and pray
and I promise you the remedy is on its way
but you can never be like me so don&#39;t waste your time
because I reign supreme and my position is divine
What&#39;s wrong with being self possessed?
Nobody&#39;s satisfied with being second best
I&#39;ve got the gift and I know that I&#39;m blessed
and I&#39;ve got to get it off my chest
I&#39;m the biggest the best better than the rest, better than the rest X
4
I&#39;m not afraid of competition &#39;cos I know that I&#39;m the best
and you haven&#39;t got a chance to even pass my little test
Even if you wanted to you couldn&#39;t pay the price
there ain&#39;t no room for losers in my perfect paradise
&#39;cos life is always based upon the weight of your success
so I&#39;ll make sure that I get the most and nothing less
If I love myself then everyone will love me to
and there&#39;s nothing you can do for me that I can&#39;t do
Chorus
So welcome to my kingdom and enjoy your little stay
Even if you can&#39;t afford it I&#39;ll still make you pay
so you&#39;d better come and get it and enjoy it while you can
don&#39;t tell me that you&#39;re dumb enough to think I give a damn
I couldn&#39;t care less about what you achieve
and there&#39;s only one thing that you have to believe
the only thing important that you have to understand
is that no matter what you say it&#39;s still a god I really am
Chorus</description>
