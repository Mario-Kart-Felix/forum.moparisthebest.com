          <blockquote>
              <p>A client is an application or system that accesses a remote service on another computer system, known as a server, by way of a network. The term was first applied to devices that were not capable of running their own stand-alone programs, but could interact with remote computers via a network. These dumb terminals were clients of the time-sharing mainframe computer.</p>
<p>Basically it runs the game, Most Clients should work with any Source but you can be sure there will be Nulls</p>
<p>People do make clients and Sources but lots of people Leech.</p>
