    <description>Well , i&#39;m sure the lot of you have faced this problem ;
you want to make it so that a staircase takes you up / down , but then you realize that you have to stand adjacent to the coordinate where the object is placed , and not all around the object.

now , how would i handle this problem?
i tried the inArea method , didn&#39;t work...</description>
