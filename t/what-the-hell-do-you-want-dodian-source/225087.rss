    <title>What The Hell Do You Want? [Dodian Source]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-the-hell-do-you-want-dodian-source/225087</link>
    <description>Hey Mopar Members.

I recently released a dodian source, which i cleaned out a bit for the people who wanted to start clean and didn&#39;t know certain packet numbers.

Now, since most of the people didn&#39;t appreciate that, I&#39;m gonna ask you. What do you want me to do?

I have a dodian source, and i&#39;m gonna do my work on that. So tell me, with my dodian source what do u want me to do. Whether it be a skill or soemthing else. tell me what you want me to code, i&#39;ll code it on dodian/devo 7 and release it in this section as a dodian/devolution 7.0 function/piece of work.

So just leave a msg with what you would like to see here, then i&#39;ll take some into conisderation.
[b]Thanks.[/b]</description>

<p>There are different opinions on good economy. Shop prices, and also player trade prices, it depends on who is playing for the economy tbh.</p>
<p>Also, I’m asking what skill people want done.</p>
<p>I’ll do the skill, and release it in the development section.</p>
