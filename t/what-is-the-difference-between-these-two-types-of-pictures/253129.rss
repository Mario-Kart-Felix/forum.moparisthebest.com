    <description>Ok first off i would just like to thank you for taking the time to help, it means a lot to me!

I am not new to private servers (ive been playing them for like a year) but i have decided to try to start my own private server. I have downloaded several sources but am still unsure as to which one i should use.

What is the difference between these two types of sources?

IS one a 317 and the other a 377 or what?

If these both are bad please tell me of one that you would suggest using, thanks in advance,

Sincerely,
Adin</description>

<p>On-topic: The top is the server, the bottom is a client. you run the top one, start the bottom one, type 127.0.0.1 into the server ip, and connect.</p>
