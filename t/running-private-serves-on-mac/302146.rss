    <title>Running private serves on mac?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/running-private-serves-on-mac/302146</link>
    <description>i have bee able to run 317&#39;s on mac&#39;s without having to use a .jar or another mac compatible file. by using commands in terminal i found online. but does anyone know how to run a 525 one? 

to run a  317 on a mac all you would do is type in terminal &quot;cd (file name here) press enter than copy and paste this &quot;/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home/bin/java -Xmx500m client 66 live live software members english game0&quot;

and it would run. but it does not work with 508+ any help appreciated, thank you!</description>
