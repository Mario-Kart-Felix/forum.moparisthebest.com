    <description>Ok i am trying to make a command to change your username....
This is what i got:

[code]	if(cmd[0].equals(&quot;changeuser&quot;)) {
	        String user = command.substring((command.indexOf(&quot; &quot;) + 1));
		XStreamPlayerLoader.punish.writeTo(user, &quot;./data/text/UserNameChanges&quot;);
			player.getPlayerDetails().username = Misc.formatPlayerNameForDisplay(user);
			player.getPlayerDetails().displayName = Misc.formatPlayerNameForDisplay(user);
			player.sm(&quot;your new username is &quot;+user+&quot; please note: LOG IN WITH YOUR FIRST USERNAME&quot;);
			player.sm(&quot;YOUR OLD USERNAME (FIRST USER) YOU WILL NEED TO LOG IN WITH&quot;);
World.getInstance().engine().getWorkerThread().savePlayer(player);
	}[/code]


But all it does is make a  new character file, how do i fix? help plox , it does change my name in game, but when i log in and out, boom back to my old one, also i can log into my username that i changed to, so it makes 2 char files... But can there be a way to delete the one? Also if i change my username, i can&#39;t yell..... please help</description>
