Hello this is the creation of a new beginning .
 What this new creation will be is a mixture of runescape and league of legends to create something amazing new and unique for a great experence to gamers.  

You must know Java extensively, and have a relatively good understanding . It would be beneficial if you had an understanding of any scripting languages, especially Ruby and/or Python as these languages may come into use later down the line of development. Of course content building and upgrading will be required and general debugging in the hosting stages.

All work is to be kept clean an noted to make thing&#39;s easier to find and to be organized.

Developer&#39;s are not to argue with one another.

Note we will not be using Runescapes client everything will be written from scratch to keep clear of any type of copyright
