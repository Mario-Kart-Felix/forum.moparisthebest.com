XHTML is a cleaned up version of HTML. What HTML was supposed to be. You’ll notice some tags and attributes won’t work using XHTML. If you’re making a professional site, XHTML is a must.<br>

<p>EDIT: Im gunna completely re-make TheCowScape site as i do believe it has too many images!</p>
<p>-EDIT: XHTML is much like HTML isnt it? Just more proper, i think its a better language. And CSS seems pretty simply, lol should be starting the new site soon</p>

<p>Thanks lots!!<br>

<p>Let me get this out in the beginning.  I think both are bad.</p>
<p>With that aside, learn XHTML and CSS.  Being image-based and taking a long time to load is never excusable.  For your personal site, work on a color scheme.  Deep green, white, and black do not constitue a color scheme.  The green/black background is rather annoying.  The ‘Create new account’ and ‘Play Cowscape’ buttons are rather obnoxious, try a better font or something that’s not pure white.  Your mouseovers could be replaced with a simple CSS hover function and color swap instead of images.  Finally, the gradient bars look bad.  To improve on that, you should just remake it from scratch.</p>
<p>About your dad’s site, I think he’s humoring you by telling you it will replace his current site.  His current site looks perfectly professional (though a hover effect would do wonders with the menu and slowing down the flash animation would be an improvement), and your remake is comparatively bad.  You sextupled the size of the index file, and you probably at least doubled the download size of the other parts of the index.  It is again, image-based, which is a big no-no, and is a sign of laziness to learn real web design, not to mention web development.[/quote]</p>
<p>Okay, thank you very much for your comment!</p>
<p>I am not in any way saying what you said is wrong, however ive seen many many popular websites that are image based, but they do seem to load faster than mine, however my file sizes are larger than usual, i will be able to speed up the load time a bit, but not completely. As with the gradient and color, i was expecting a few comments on that as i did the gradient using Paint and to be honest i am no good with colors!</p>
<p>First my dads current site is image based , however, like mentioned before he has GIF and i have 100% JPG , but i wil change to GIF soon. My dad doesen’t ‘humor’ however he would take every possible opportunity to embarrass me lol, if he didnt like it, he would tell me. However you might be right.</p>
<p>I do have some basic knowledge of CSS, however ive never been able to do anything good with what i know and all good, interesting sites ive seen have been at least part image based. And as for XHTML i know nothing! So yes i should learn!</p>
<p>Thanks for the comment</p>

              <p>[quote=“the cow slay, post:1, topic:132803”]Okay ive been making websites for aaaaagggessss now! Can you please tell me what you think about a couple of them? Thanks!</p>
<p><a href="http://thecowscape.freehostia.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://thecowscape.freehostia.com</a> Ive spent aaagess on this! It is image bassed not css (well there is a bit of css! lol ) so consiquently it takes agges to load! I made the images in paint (.bmp) because my photoshop stopped working but i changed them into (.jpg) after i got my photoshop back, allthough it hasnt seemed to make much of a difference! If you could tell me what you think that would be great!</p>
<p><a href="http://bishopandsmith.freehostia.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://bishopandsmith.freehostia.com</a> This one didnt take as long. I made it for my dad, (for his bussiness Bishop &amp; Smith Stainless Fabrication Ltd) and its going to be replacing his current website once completely finnished (his current website is <a href="http://www.bishopandsmith.co.uk" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bishopandsmith.co.uk</a>) Could you please tell me which site you prefer, his current website or mine.</p>
<p>Thanks lots!![/quote]</p>
<p>Let me get this out in the beginning.  I think both are bad.</p>
<p>With that aside, learn XHTML and CSS.  Being image-based and taking a long time to load is never excusable.  For your personal site, work on a color scheme.  Deep green, white, and black do not constitue a color scheme.  The green/black background is rather annoying.  The ‘Create new account’ and ‘Play Cowscape’ buttons are rather obnoxious, try a better font or something that’s not pure white.  Your mouseovers could be replaced with a simple CSS hover function and color swap instead of images.  Finally, the gradient bars look bad.  To improve on that, you should just remake it from scratch.</p>
<p>About your dad’s site, I think he’s humoring you by telling you it will replace his current site.  His current site looks perfectly professional (though a hover effect would do wonders with the menu and slowing down the flash animation would be an improvement), and your remake is comparatively bad.  You sextupled the size of the index file, and you probably at least doubled the download size of the other parts of the index.  It is again, image-based, which is a big no-no, and is a sign of laziness to learn real web design, not to mention web development.</p>
