    <title>718 - unpack npcspawns</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-unpack-npcspawns/465739</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m having trouble with adding a few npcs (that will actually respawn). I was just wondering if anyone has the code for a tool that will take all the packed npc spawns and place them into an unpacked format.

If I can&#39;t do this, I&#39;ll have to create my own and list all the current npc spawns, which will take forever. I&#39;ve tried the .java file, but they won&#39;t respawn. :/ 

Please help.

EDIT: Ignore this, please remove.</description>
