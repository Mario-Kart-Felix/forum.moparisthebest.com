    <title>Is there a better way to handle IP bans?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-a-better-way-to-handle-ip-bans/163612</link>
    <description>I remember a while ago there was a tut to fix IP banning so if someone is IP banned them can&#39;t make a new account at all. Does anyone know how to do it / have the code or something? I&#39;d really like to be able to get this. It&#39;s really annoying when you can&#39;t permaban someone.</description>

              <p>Why do you need handler for that?<br>
Here is how…<br>
Search for</p>
<p><code> if(checkbannedusers() == 5) {
  returnCode = 4;
  System.out.println(playerName+" failed to logon because they are banned.");
  appendToLR(playerName+" failed to logon because they are banned.");
  savefile = false;
  disconnected = true;
}</code></p>
<p>Find your ipban code and replace it with this</p>
<p><code>if(checkbannedips() == 5) { 
  destruct(); 
  returnCode = 4; 
  System.out.println(playerName+" failed to logon because their ip is banned."); 
  appendToLR(playerName+" failed to logon because their ip is banned."); 
}  
</code></p>
