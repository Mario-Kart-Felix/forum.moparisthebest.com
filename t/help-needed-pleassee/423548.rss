    <description>I posted this in client help section but everything I post there it always sinks to the bottom and I get no help :(

Hey, I just need help where to place [code=java]new CacheDownloader(this).downloadCache();[/code] In client.java

I used to know but I stopped with autocache downloaders and now I cant remember where to place this.

Please Help, I am begging you I bought a VPS and now I want to put my server on. But I can&#39;t as my autocache downloader won&#39;t work and these days players are to lazy to do it manually.

Thanks, Mr Rushed</description>
