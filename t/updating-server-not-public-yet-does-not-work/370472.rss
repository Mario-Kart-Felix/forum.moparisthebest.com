    <title>Updating Server (not public yet) does not work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/updating-server-not-public-yet-does-not-work/370472</link>
    <description>hey dere.

I got a question again:
I changed some things on my server they work without anything else. I just have to save the new textdocument.java . Like i was able to change the amount of items in any shop
with only clicking on save

But there are things like changing NPCHandlings (the text they talk, for example them at home)
How do i update that server a fter changing? I cant succesfully update and do i have to click on compile.bat? how does that work?</description>

<p>yes, after you change .java files you have to click the compiler, wait 5-15 seconds and it will do everything, then after it’s done compiling restart your server.</p>
