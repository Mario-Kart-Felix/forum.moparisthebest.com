    <description>Every once in a while i get a noob who decides to somehow make 15x of the same account and spamm the crap out of my server and when i try to ip mute or ip ban them it says player name does not exist what can i do about this? Heres my ipmute command

if (command.startsWith(&quot;ipmute&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 0) {
                try {
                    String otherPName = command.substring(7);
                    int otherPIndex = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(otherPName);

                    if (otherPIndex != -1) {
                        client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[otherPIndex];
                        writeLog(p.connectedFrom, &quot;mutes2&quot;);
         p.muted = true;
                        p.sM(
                                &quot;You have been ip muted by &quot; + playerName);
         sM(&quot;You have ip muted &quot;+p.playerName+&quot;&quot;);
                    } else { 
                       sM(&quot;The name doesnt exist.&quot;); 
                    }
                } catch (Exception e) { 
                    sM(&quot;Try entering a name you want to tele to ip mute..&quot;);
                }
            }</description>

</aside>
<p>would mean player rights have to be above 1 to use the command common player playerRights = 0 and i trust all my mods with the highest level of confidence, also the ip mute works i tested it but just not in this case altho i think i have found a solution to this could someone post so i can post again (cant double post)(gonna post the “possible” solution</p>

              <p>On the players name if they use the multi account span it would go like</p>
<p>Playername<br>
Playername1<br>
Playername2<br>
And so on ip the one without the number at the end and I’m sure ipmute is for staff so change<br>
&amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 1 or w.e</p>
