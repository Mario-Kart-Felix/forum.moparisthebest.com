    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/3rd-master-hard-disk-error/288384</link>
    <description>
Google has proved useless for me in this scenario.

So last night I was playing Plants Vs Zombies and the power went out. It wasn&#39;t storming or anything. The power just flickered, went out for about 10 seconds, and came back.

Well all my other PCs booted up fine. Except the one I was on. It said:

3rd Master Hard Disk Error
Press F1 to resume.

After pressing F1, it brought me to a screen saying something about nothing to boot from, either change BIOS or insert boot media and press any key.

Same thing every time I restarted. I finally got into the BIOS, and it said I had two DVD drives (correct), a floppy (correct), and nothing else (not correct). My HD is plugged into the first SATA port. Boot order is floppy, CD, then nothing cause the HD wasn&#39;t there.

So it&#39;s not like the HD was empty or anything, it just wasn&#39;t recognizing it. So maybe it&#39;s the motherboard?

Booted up with Hiren bootcd, ran some tests. Motherboard tests all passed. Ran some HD tests. All the tests only had the option to test my two DVD drives, not the HD.

So I ran some different HD tests, partitioning and stuff. All of them said no HD to partition or test.

So I ran a miniature Windows 98 from the RAM. My Computer stated two DVD drives, the RAM drive, and no HD.

So I&#39;m like fuck, it&#39;s not recognizing it. I plug the HD into the other three SATA ports and each time a different error.

4th Master Hard Disk Error.
3rd Slave Hard Disk Error.
4th Slave Hard Disk Error.

All the while nothing is recognizing the drive.

So I&#39;m like shit time to buy a new HD. However I take out the bootcd and reboot again and what the fuck?

No I.D.E. Master HD (or something).
Press F1 to resume.

So I notice in the list that there is a HD recognized at SATA4. I press F1 and WOW. It boots! Everything&#39;s normal.

Holy shit. It works. No need to buy another HD, it was just being stupid.

So all was fine, except I turned it off, put the cover back on, and booted again.

4th Slave Hard Disk Error.

Fuck not again. Well kinda, I rebooted 5 more times and on the 5th time I got

No I.D.E. Master HD

Again, and I pressed F1 and it booted fine.

So now if I ever have to reboot I probably have to do it a lot to get it to work.

Any idea what&#39;s going on?</description>

It should say something like surge/spike protector, cause some just have the reset for a different reason.</p>
