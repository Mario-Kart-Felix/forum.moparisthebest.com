[size=14pt]Introduction[/size]     

     Galaxy is a #317 RuneScape emulator based off the concept of asynchronous programming. It&#39;s main design is modeled off the NIO reactor pattern and you can see more information on what each specific class does in the description below. It currently only supports connection accepting but the login procedure is already set up and has been completed to the point of the session key exchanges. Any constructive criticism can be left below and I assume there will be some since this is my first attempt at asynchronous programming. (The original name of the project was Styx)


[size=14pt]Description[/size]   

Constants.java
Holds all the constant variables utilized throughout the server.

Galaxy.java
The main class, as of right now it only initializes the login server.

RuneScapeEvent.java
An interface for the three possible events triggered by the Selector.

RuneScapeEventHandler.java
An implementation of &#39;RuneScapeEvent&#39;. This is where the events are dealt with.

RuneScapeServer.java
An interface to handle the listening and binding of a RuneScape style server.
It was written as an interface in hopes that at some point a JAGGRAB server could also 
be derived from it, but as of right now only the login server is written.

RuneScapeProtocolDecoder.java
An interface to handle protocol decoding, such as packets and login.

RuneScapeLoginProtocolDecoder.java
This class is infered whenever a message is read from the &#39;RuneScapeEventHandler&#39; and
the connection is not considered to be logger in. No protocol is actually decoded here it instead checks the state and moves onto another class for the actual decoding.

RuneScapeLoginProtocolDecoderActor.java
Performs the action of login protocol decoding. This class is an implementation of
&#39;RuneScapeLoginState&#39; where the login stages are broken down in an interface and
triggered based on the connection&#39;s current state. They are triggered in the &#39;RuneScapeLoginProtocolDecoder&#39; class.

RuneScapeLoginServer
This is where the address is bound and the selector is initialized. Once the binding has
been completed it moves on to the listening where a single thread executed with
the &#39;ScheduledExecutorService&#39; processes the selector and it&#39;s keys. Once a key has been
deemed proper it is then dispensed to the &#39;RuneScapeEventHandler&#39; to be dealt with.

RuneScapeLoginState.java
This is where the login stages are broken down into an interface.

ServerConnection.java
Represents a connection. This class is inferred after a connection has been accepted in
the &#39;RuneScapeEventHandler&#39; class. This class holds our buffer, channel, and selection key.
Once the entity system was done it was going to be linked with the player to hold the network
variables.

ServerConnectionMap.java
A Map to HashMap to hold the active connections in the server.

[size=14pt]Conclusion[/size]
    This is not nearly a complete server and has only been a learning experience for me. I am aware that some of the content is not as good as can be or a little over written but thats all part of the learning experience. I hope to take what i&#39;ve learned from this and succeed with my next framework.

[size=14pt]Credits[/size]
Taharok: Urged me to look into asynchronous programming.
AtomicInt: Offered constructive criticism and advice on my project thread.
Blakeman8192: I used a design similar to yours for the connection map.
Sinisoul: Some of the advice that ryley gave me he learned from you.

<p>Meh, I’ll take a look. :)[/quote]</p>
<p>I didn’t fully understand the concept of implementing asynchronous programming into a RuneScape emulator and I decided to return to this approach at a later time. I learned a lot from this project but in the end I didn’t have the required knowledge to continue it, that being said; I couldn’t hope to implement systems I didn’t fully understand correctly without copying and pasting somebody else s code. Im currently sketching designs in my notebook for a Netty implementation, even though I dislike bulky libraries i’m going to give it a chance.</p>

<p>Thank you for the support, I plan to begin on a new framework making use of the Netty API very soon. The concept of asynchronous programming is still a bit complex for me and i’ve only just cracked the surface with it. I hope that i’ll be able to take this Netty framework much further and really develop something special.</p>

This is where the login stages are broken down into an interface.</p>
<p>ServerConnection.java<br>
Represents a connection. This class is inferred after a connection has been accepted in<br>
the ‘RuneScapeEventHandler’ class. This class holds our buffer, channel, and selection key.<br>
Once the entity system was done it was going to be linked with the player to hold the network<br>
variables.</p>
<p>ServerConnectionMap.java<br>
A Map to HashMap to hold the active connections in the server.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]Conclusion[/size]<br>
This is not nearly a complete server and has only been a learning experience for me. I am aware that some of the content is not as good as can be or a little over written but thats all part of the learning experience. I hope to take what i’ve learned from this and succeed with my next framework.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]Credits[/size]<br>

Blakeman8192: I used a design similar to yours for the connection map.<br>
