    <description>Hello Moparscape Community,

Just for fun in my spare time when I&#39;m not developing for a HTML5 chat site a couple friends are making, I am going to be working on a web version of iTunes. It will have a similar layout, and effect, but I&#39;ll try my best to customize it more to the user&#39;s liking and depending on certain things, allow users to toggle it on or off, and not have stupid things iTunes has that no one likes.

I realize this will take time to do but as I am doing this in my spare time and something that may be fun. Do you guys think this would be cool, or may not be able to work because of certain criteria&#39;s? Let me know :)

- Tea

PS: For anyone that may ask why my name is &quot;Tea&quot;, it&#39;s because in real life, I make my own tea on the stove and I drink a lot of it (I&#39;m not fat :P) and always have a mason jar full of it with me wherever I go. So, there is a little story on why my name is &quot;Tea&quot;.</description>

<p>Nice to meet you, Tea.  I am an unsweetened fan myself.  I normally will drink that or water. [/quote]</p>
<p>I do plan on completing it even if it does take awhile. Certain programs or website’s that may be like this don’t exactly meet the user’s standard 100% and that is what I will strive the most for.</p>

<p>Also, Pwnd, I like to drink sweet Tea <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
