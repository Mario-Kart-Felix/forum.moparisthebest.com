    <title>Help! Tried everything!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-tried-everything/362143</link>
    <description>I have the source Noobscape, (http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,372737.0.html) and I cannot find a webclient! I have tried Tobex, that doesn&#39;t work. My character looks all messed up and has a weird name. Also the Bluurrs based client won&#39;t work on Tobex. It says the client is Bluurrs based, I tried using Ric&#39;s Webclient Tutorial and that didn&#39;t work. Please do not tell me to search or use google. I already HAVE! Please tell me how  I can get a webclient, or if you can make one for me. If you make one for me, I will give you Moderator on the server when I release it. Thanks in advance- Josdog</description>

              <p>nnobscape eh? if it’s as old as the version i’m thinking of, then just use <a href="http://www.silabsoft.org" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.silabsoft.org</a>  or <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> webclient just make sure when u go to log in u use 127.0.0.1 and everyone else uses the IP address u have made for server. if it’s an more updated version than what i’m thinking of. gimme the link as to where u downloaded it from, so i could further assist you. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
