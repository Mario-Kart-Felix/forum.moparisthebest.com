    <description>[center][b]Base [/b]: [b]Paragon 464[/b]/[b]Hyperion[/b]
[/center]
Hey well im about to start a new project but this time instead of working alone i&#39;d rather like to work with a group of 3-4 people on this.

Basically we&#39;ll be starting from near-scratch,We are using Paragon 464 (updated by ub3r@r-s) which contains these updated features.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cool GUI (not close to finished).
Added item wielding.
Added running.
Added most of the emotes.
Added teleporting functionality.
Added Scu&#39;s tickable system.
Added functionality for removing equipment.
Better command system.
Loaded new item def through JSON serialization.
Regional ground item support.
Loaded new NPC def through JSON serialization.
NPC rendering. 
NPC interact packet handling.
NPC spawns through JSON.
Started shops.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Im hoping for this to be a big project and for that I will be investing quite a bit of money on this project but that will be in time when we&#39;ll start beta testing and such.

Currently I need;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[ul][li]Server Developer - 1-2[/li]
[li]Client Developer - 1[/li]
[li]Events Manager - 1[/li]
[li]Advertisement Manager - 2[/li][/ul]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b]Server Developers[/b], would basically be developing the server.
[b]Client Developers[/b], would basically be developing the client.
[b]Events Manager[/b], would basically be working on community interaction and ways on making the community a lot more fun.
[b]Advertisement Managers[/b], would basically be making sure that we&#39;re pretty much on every top list and are trying to get pretty much everyone voting and getting the word for the server out.

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">Position Applying For:</span> Server Developer, Client Developer, Events Manager, Advertisement Manager<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Experience in the Position:</span><br>
Server: I’m studying IT at highschool now in Belgium. I’m at the end of my first year so… We got the basics from java and I’ve been messing arround with servers since 6 years ago.<br>
Client Developer: Same as above…<br>
Events Manager: I would like to host my owner server because I love to do it but I can’t realy affort it and do it on my own so… I’m creative in this sort of things.<br>
Advertisement Manager: Advertisement is first of all something you’ve to pay for… second, it has to look good. If I see a server and the media is crappy or the site is ugly. I won’t join. I can do photoshop and webdesign and stuff. Advertisement is also having a good image… If your server is different. Not like 70% of all servers then you’ll get members I think.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Why you should be chosen:</span><br>
Euhm… It’s hard to tell but I’m actually looking for a “project” or something to do… I just love helping people and working on a project like this in a team. The feeling when your server is running well and you’ve put so much energy in it is a great feeling so. You can trust me, I’ll do my best to fit your team but I need respect and dedication also. Team work is very important for me. If I see servers where the owner is online and there are like 5 mods and 20 members… that’s not dedication.<br>
Do you have Skype?: Yes. Contact me by email and I’ll add you if you like…</p>
<p>P.S as you can see I haven’t been that active on this forum but that’s because it’s the first time I want to co-operate with people. Before, all I did was downloading sources and coding on my own because I couldn’t host anyway…<br>
And I’m sorry for my language, as I said I’m from Belgium so.<br>
If you have any questions, hit me up!</p>
<p>Goodluck,<br>
Denny</p>
