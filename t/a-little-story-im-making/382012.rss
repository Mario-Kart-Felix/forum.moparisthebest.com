    <title>A little story I&#39;m making</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-little-story-im-making/382012</link>
    <description>FOR TRENTON AKA TRENT K. (LEVEL
 8 hybrid) and his friend Pavall (level 15 hybrid),
 life&#39;s a battle and then you die. And
then you rez. And then you battle again. At
least, that&#39;s how it is in Project Catastrophe, the addictive
online game that makes real life seem dreary
by comparison.
At his new school, Trenton feels weird and
out of place, but in beautiful and complex
Project Catastrophe, his hybrid character is doing
great: leveling fast, learning new skills, and
making friends. He&#39;s even met a level 138 character,
UndeadSnipe, who has recruited him and 
Pavall into his clan: Myths Awoken.
Trenton wishes he could spend all his time
in the game-until UndeadSnipe transprots him
and Paval to the real Project Catastrophe, the
perilous world in the eleventh deminsion!
Before they are allowed to leave, they
 must complete a high-level quest that
may determine Project Catastrophe&#39;s survival-and
Trenton&#39;s, too. If they don&#39;t get out soon, Trenton
could be stuck as the character he plays,
Trent K. the hybrid.
The two friends accept UndeadSnipe&#39;s quest and meet
Layva, a runaway who was lured into Project Catastrophe
against his will. The three make their way through
a country on the brink of war, fighting monsters,
traitors, and spies-yet their greatest danger may be
Trenton himself.....


[b][center]Chapter One[/center][/b]
	The problem with killing Hill Giants was that, aside from their massive size, they were completely human. Their battle cries could only be made by human throats, and they gasped the same way anyone would when Paval&#39;s dagger pierced their torsos. The death blow itself sounded with a juicy thump, like a dowel going through a watermelon. Trent K. had an uncomfortable feeling that the sound effect was based on actual research.
	Altogether they had bagged fifteen. The last one was a female, she had collapsed at their feet, blood pulsing from her wounds. Trent K. hated killing the females. Even while dying, the gigantic girl looked really good in her buckskin leggings, and vests, and he felt like the lowest of the low as he looted their glittering corpses.
He said as much to Paval before the ambush, but he just laughed at him. A Hill Giant was a NPC: a Non-playable Character. What&#39;s more, it was a hostile NPC: born to be killed, or to kill other characters.
	According to the quest&#39;s narrative, Hill Giants were infesting the hill towns of Galthra and terrorizing the farmers and shepherds. The Galthra Guards had put a bounty on their heads. Anyone who turned in twelve big bones dropped by the Hill Giants would get a reward from the Duke: 5k(5,000gp), and their choice of either a rare weapon or armor piece. It all depended on their level of course. With a reward like that, how could killing them be wrong?
	Paval had been harping about the rare weapons for the past forty-five minutes, and when he realized they had finally killed (and even exceeded) their quota, he cheered once then took off. Trent K. tried to follow him, but the hills were steep, and after three weeks of playing, he still wasn&#39;t great at maneuvering. Paval had no problem zigzagging up the slopes, but Trent K. always managed to choose routes that were impossible to scale, and all he did was run in place like an idiot.
	Within thirty seconds Paval was completely out of sight. Trent K. typed a message, fingers flying over the keyboard. It appeared as blue-letter clan chat in the lower left corner of his screen.

Trent K. Says: Lost! Where are you?
Pavall Says: Stay put. Be there in a sec.

	A lone low level hybrid wouldn&#39;t survive long in such a heavily patrolled area. He was sure to be attacked, and his bronze armor couldn&#39;t deflect many direct strikes. Paval, a higher level hybrid, wore full mithril armor that could take a lot of pounding. Ideally if a high level monster attacked, he&#39;d make himself the monster&#39;s primary target, and Trent K. would cast spells or shoot arrows, out of harms way. If Paval couldn&#39;t hold the aggro, they&#39;d die pretty quickly; but that was happening less often now. Their skills were improving and their teamwork was good. This evening was a record: they had completed three quests and hadn&#39;t died once-yet.
	Trent K. panned over the alpine landscape. The winter light was dazzling, magnified by snow banks and a frost-covered path. Somber oak trees cast crisp, dark shadows on the white world, and a single flute played in the distance. The melody ascended to a sustained high note, descended, then ascended again. The pattern repeated many times, yet the flute player was nowhere to be seen. Nothing stirred but three white unicorns a little off in the distance. The unicorns didn&#39;t look threatening, but Trent K. moved his mouse over one of them to check its stats. The npc was a level 12. He could handle one of them, but not three. He took cover beneath a large yew tree. Could the see him beneath the branches? It seemed likely. Their walking path was widening and closing in, soon he would be within their striking range. He began to type.

Trent K. Says: Come on, Paval. Some unicorns are going to chew me up and spit me out.
Paval Says: Fighting.

	Trent K. glanced up at the green line that indicated Paval&#39;s constitution (health). He was losing health rapidly. He knew it was wrong to sit there while Paval was being attacked, but he was hemmed in on all sides. How could he find him without getting killed himself?
	The green line was falling very quickly, 

Trent K. Says: Oh, nooo. Hang in there Paval. I&#39;m on my way.

	Cautiously he stepped away from the tree. The Unicorns were walking away. He was no longer a target. Perhaps he had never been one.
	He ran to the top of a hill and surveyed the countryside. To the west he could see smoke curling from the Galthra Village chimneys, where he had to go to complete the quest. Beyond the village, newbie players were killing their first beasts, Level 2 Men and Goblins. Paval wouldn&#39;t be there: beginner-area monsters were too weak to challenge him.
	Perhaps he should retrace his steps, but where had they even come from? It had started to snow, and their footprints were disappearing fast. He fixed his eyes on the faint depressions, too absorbed in finding his way to be properly vigilant.
	A level 22 Hobgoblin opened up a trapdoor to the left which Trent K. hadn’t seen because of the snow, and planted itself directly in his path. The creature resembled a normal goblin that had been skinned. Blood pulsed through its body, and a cloud of purple vapor surrounded its head. Trent K. knew that the vapor was a potent weapon: poisonous breath. When the beast was within striking range, it exhaled a lethal purple plume that weakened a player&#39;s defenses over time as well as lowering ones health.
	Trent K. knew he couldn&#39;t take it alone. He started to run, and the beast charged after him. The world around him blurred. The beast&#39;s breath was diminishing his health, but if he could just get to the border of its territory, he might survive.
	 He ran across the frozen land, its surface crosshatched by a group of players who where having a snow ball fight. They didn&#39;t appear to notice him pass by, though he was close enough to distinguish the light brown spots on their fur hats.
	In the distance he glimpsed a road curving around the shoreline south of Wizend Manor. He&#39;d probably be safe if he could reach it. Beasts rarely attacked on major thoroughfares. Those that did were often put to death by the prison guards.
	Trent K. reached the road. The beast wheeled around and ran off as soon as his hard leather boots touched the frost-dusted cobblestones.
	Trenton pounded his fist on the desk. Yes! He was safe. What about Paval?
	He checked on Paval&#39;s icon. When players form a clan, each group mate was identified by an icon, in the from of a tiny portrait of their individual character. Beneath the portrait was the character&#39;s name and level, as well as a constitution bar that showed their degree of health. When the group disbanded, the portraits disappeared.
	Paval&#39;s constitution was plunging, and his icon had started to fade. Death was inevitable. Trent K. watched the constitution anxiously, but to his surprise, it stabilized and began to creep back to normal. He heard the clink of coins going into his bag and heaved a sigh of relief. Not only was Paval alive, he was looting his attacker-and he had to be nearby or he wouldn&#39;t be able to share the spoils.

Trent K. Says: What happened?
Paval Says: I soloed Dracula in Wizend Manor!
Trent K. Says: You killed a vampire?? What next? The wolfman?
Paval Says: L0L0L. It wasn&#39;t just a vampire. It was Dracula! He is level 20! YAH!!! Hybrid power ftw.
Trent K. Says: Ftw?
Paval Says: You=tragic n00b. Ftw=For the win, as in the awesomeness of Paval that made it possible to kill Dracula all by his self.
Trent K. Says: Wow. Grats.
Paval Says: Actually, I tell a lie. A level 58 mage did it. She was running through and stopped to help me.
Trent K. Says: Thts kool that he didn&#39;t steal your loot.	 


Well thats all I got so far. Tell me what you think.</description>

However, the story merged between real life and an internet game at some points. I don't know if this was intended or not, but I think it would be better if you chose one of them.

              <p>FOR TRENTON AKA TRENT K. (LEVEL<br>
8 hybrid) and his friend Pavall (level 15 hybrid),<br>
life’s a battle and then you die. And<br>
then you rez. And then you battle again. At<br>
least, that’s how it is in Project Catastrophe, the addictive<br>
online game that makes real life seem dreary<br>
by comparison.<br>
At his new school, Trenton feels weird and<br>
out of place, but in beautiful and complex<br>
Project Catastrophe, his hybrid character is doing<br>
great: leveling fast, learning new skills, and<br>
making friends. He’s even met a level 138 character,<br>
UndeadSnipe, who has recruited him and<br>
Pavall into his clan: Myths Awoken.<br>
Trenton wishes he could spend all his time<br>
in the game-until UndeadSnipe transprots him<br>
and Paval to the real Project Catastrophe, the<br>
perilous world in the eleventh deminsion!<br>
Before they are allowed to leave, they<br>
must complete a high-level quest that<br>
may determine Project Catastrophe’s survival-and<br>
Trenton’s, too. If they don’t get out soon, Trenton<br>
could be stuck as the character he plays,<br>
Trent K. the hybrid.<br>
The two friends accept UndeadSnipe’s quest and meet<br>
Layva, a runaway who was lured into Project Catastrophe<br>
against his will. The three make their way through<br>
a country on the brink of war, fighting monsters,<br>
traitors, and spies-yet their greatest danger may be<br>
Trenton himself…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[center]Chapter One[/center]</span><br>
The problem with killing Hill Giants was that, aside from their massive size, they were completely human. Their battle cries could only be made by human throats, and they gasped the same way anyone would when Paval’s dagger pierced their torsos. The death blow itself sounded with a juicy thump, like a dowel going through a watermelon. Trent K. had an uncomfortable feeling that the sound effect was based on actual research.<br>
Altogether they had bagged fifteen. The last one was a female, she had collapsed at their feet, blood pulsing from her wounds. Trent K. hated killing the females. Even while dying, the gigantic girl looked really good in her buckskin leggings, and vests, and he felt like the lowest of the low as he looted their glittering corpses.<br>
He said as much to Paval before the ambush, but he just laughed at him. A Hill Giant was a NPC: a Non-playable Character. What’s more, it was a hostile NPC: born to be killed, or to kill other characters.<br>
According to the quest’s narrative, Hill Giants were infesting the hill towns of Galthra and terrorizing the farmers and shepherds. The Galthra Guards had put a bounty on their heads. Anyone who turned in twelve big bones dropped by the Hill Giants would get a reward from the Duke: 5k(5,000gp), and their choice of either a rare weapon or armor piece. It all depended on their level of course. With a reward like that, how could killing them be wrong?<br>
Paval had been harping about the rare weapons for the past forty-five minutes, and when he realized they had finally killed (and even exceeded) their quota, he cheered once then took off. Trent K. tried to follow him, but the hills were steep, and after three weeks of playing, he still wasn’t great at maneuvering. Paval had no problem zigzagging up the slopes, but Trent K. always managed to choose routes that were impossible to scale, and all he did was run in place like an idiot.<br>
Within thirty seconds Paval was completely out of sight. Trent K. typed a message, fingers flying over the keyboard. It appeared as blue-letter clan chat in the lower left corner of his screen.</p>
<p>Trent K. Says: Lost! Where are you?<br>
Pavall Says: Stay put. Be there in a sec.</p>
<pre><code>A lone low level hybrid wouldn't survive long in such a heavily patrolled area. He was sure to be attacked, and his bronze armor couldn't deflect many direct strikes. Paval, a higher level hybrid, wore full mithril armor that could take a lot of pounding. Ideally if a high level monster attacked, he'd make himself the monster's primary target, and Trent K. would cast spells or shoot arrows, out of harms way. If Paval couldn't hold the aggro, they'd die pretty quickly; but that was happening less often now. Their skills were improving and their teamwork was good. This evening was a record: they had completed three quests and hadn't died once-yet.
Trent K. panned over the alpine landscape. The winter light was dazzling, magnified by snow banks and a frost-covered path. Somber oak trees cast crisp, dark shadows on the white world, and a single flute played in the distance. The melody ascended to a sustained high note, descended, then ascended again. The pattern repeated many times, yet the flute player was nowhere to be seen. Nothing stirred but three white unicorns a little off in the distance. The unicorns didn't look threatening, but Trent K. moved his mouse over one of them to check its stats. The npc was a level 12. He could handle one of them, but not three. He took cover beneath a large yew tree. Could the see him beneath the branches? It seemed likely. Their walking path was widening and closing in, soon he would be within their striking range. He began to type.
</code></pre>
<p>Trent K. Says: Come on, Paval. Some unicorns are going to chew me up and spit me out.<br>
Paval Says: Fighting.</p>
<pre><code>Trent K. glanced up at the green line that indicated Paval's constitution (health). He was losing health rapidly. He knew it was wrong to sit there while Paval was being attacked, but he was hemmed in on all sides. How could he find him without getting killed himself?
The green line was falling very quickly, 
</code></pre>
<p>Trent K. Says: Oh, nooo. Hang in there Paval. I’m on my way.</p>
<pre><code>Cautiously he stepped away from the tree. The Unicorns were walking away. He was no longer a target. Perhaps he had never been one.
He ran to the top of a hill and surveyed the countryside. To the west he could see smoke curling from the Galthra Village chimneys, where he had to go to complete the quest. Beyond the village, newbie players were killing their first beasts, Level 2 Men and Goblins. Paval wouldn't be there: beginner-area monsters were too weak to challenge him.
Perhaps he should retrace his steps, but where had they even come from? It had started to snow, and their footprints were disappearing fast. He fixed his eyes on the faint depressions, too absorbed in finding his way to be properly vigilant.
A level 22 Hobgoblin opened up a trapdoor to the left which Trent K. hadn’t seen because of the snow, and planted itself directly in his path. The creature resembled a normal goblin that had been skinned. Blood pulsed through its body, and a cloud of purple vapor surrounded its head. Trent K. knew that the vapor was a potent weapon: poisonous breath. When the beast was within striking range, it exhaled a lethal purple plume that weakened a player's defenses over time as well as lowering ones health.
Trent K. knew he couldn't take it alone. He started to run, and the beast charged after him. The world around him blurred. The beast's breath was diminishing his health, but if he could just get to the border of its territory, he might survive.
 He ran across the frozen land, its surface crosshatched by a group of players who where having a snow ball fight. They didn't appear to notice him pass by, though he was close enough to distinguish the light brown spots on their fur hats.
In the distance he glimpsed a road curving around the shoreline south of Wizend Manor. He'd probably be safe if he could reach it. Beasts rarely attacked on major thoroughfares. Those that did were often put to death by the prison guards.
Trent K. reached the road. The beast wheeled around and ran off as soon as his hard leather boots touched the frost-dusted cobblestones.
Trenton pounded his fist on the desk. Yes! He was safe. What about Paval?
He checked on Paval's icon. When players form a clan, each group mate was identified by an icon, in the from of a tiny portrait of their individual character. Beneath the portrait was the character's name and level, as well as a constitution bar that showed their degree of health. When the group disbanded, the portraits disappeared.
Paval's constitution was plunging, and his icon had started to fade. Death was inevitable. Trent K. watched the constitution anxiously, but to his surprise, it stabilized and began to creep back to normal. He heard the clink of coins going into his bag and heaved a sigh of relief. Not only was Paval alive, he was looting his attacker-and he had to be nearby or he wouldn't be able to share the spoils.
</code></pre>
<p>Trent K. Says: What happened?<br>
Paval Says: I soloed Dracula in Wizend Manor!<br>
Trent K. Says: You killed a vampire?? What next? The wolfman?<br>
Paval Says: L0L0L. It wasn’t just a vampire. It was Dracula! He is level 20! YAH!!! Hybrid power ftw.<br>
Trent K. Says: Ftw?<br>
Paval Says: You=tragic n00b. Ftw=For the win, as in the awesomeness of Paval that made it possible to kill Dracula all by his self.<br>
Trent K. Says: Wow. Grats.<br>
Paval Says: Actually, I tell a lie. A level 58 mage did it. She was running through and stopped to help me.<br>
Trent K. Says: Thts kool that he didn’t steal your loot.</p>
<p>Well thats all I got so far. Tell me what you think.</p>
