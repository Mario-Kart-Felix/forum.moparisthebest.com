    <description>Hello Moparscape

Ive started hosting a server, I ordered a vps at : http://www.virpus.com/
Now my VPS is done, And ive never worked with an VPS before.
Is there maybe someone who can help me putting my server up on the VPS?
Ive been searching four hours on Google etc.   To find information about how to set it up.
The files are allready uploaded i just need to figure out how to get the Runescape server started (The VPS is allready running)i 
All i could find is a Console, Ive tried to run exec commands etc (Its just like MS-DOS)
Can someone please help me?</description>

              <p>You upload the files to the VPS like using <a href="http://uppit.com" rel="nofollow noopener">uppit.com</a>, and open that download link onto the VPS, I recommend downloading Firefox on the VPS.</p>
<p>You will have to edit the paths on the run.bat (maybe), and the compiler.</p>
