              <p>Sorry but: <a href="http://i.gyazo.com/9923d0aca148db5132633f2019ede7a1.png" rel="nofollow noopener">http://i.gyazo.com/9923d0aca148db5132633f2019ede7a1.png</a> isn’t 100%.<br>
RuneScape added more area’s you can port to. Some of which you don’t have maps for <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
You won’t be having 100% for a while, mate.<br>
See: <a href="http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Lodestone_Network" rel="nofollow noopener">http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Lodestone_Network</a> &amp;&amp;<br>

<p>Also note: Saying you need a community is a really bad idea… The point of advertising is to get players… If they see you have little to none, by you blatantly advertising it, most won’t want to join.</p>
<p>One more thing. Post what makes your server different. Not what every other server has. I highly doubt you have “perfect combat and 100% skilling” too. Not even going to waste my time dl’ing to prove that.</p>
