    <title>How to make a NPC who does not fight, attack and not move</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-npc-who-does-not-fight-attack-and-not-move/438772</link>
    <description>I guess to make the topic easier to understand, I am asking about Lord Iban for the Underground Pass. 
He is a NPC who does not have an attack click, yet he is supposed to attack you with spells when you enter his throne room (Well of Voyage when it is done)
How do I make it to where he does in fact cast spells, and yet does not leave his seated position in his chair?
Or...is he himself even attacking at all?
I am pretty certain it is inside NPC Handler, but I am not quite certain where to place his ID.</description>

              <p>It is what I went for. I almost thought that since he is NOT a attacking NPC by any means that perhaps it was done in the client when you pass a certain coord grid. But I have yet to figure out how I would make the spells cast at me, rather than me casting them when crossing over myself <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> It was the only conventional means I saw after checking out the NPC agression, on how he would remain in his throne and still attack me. Lol</p>
<p>Edit: Actually setting him up in a test, I copied on of the mages from the mage arena, and pasted his number in. Fights quite nicely lol. Now all I have to do is get him to stop moving lol.</p>

              <p>Yes it’s npchandler, you have to scroll a bit and you’ll see a bunch of methods like,</p>
<p>if (npcid == # &amp;&amp; protMage) {<br>
hitDiff;<br>
}</p>
<p>There should be some examples with gfx (we don’t let npcs cast spells but only the gfx looks like it)</p>
<p>Though to make him not move, and still be aggressive I have no clue honestly.<br>
I suppose you should take a look to how npc aggression is handled, and find out where it makes the npc go attack the player,<br>
and put something like<br>
(if npcid != #)  //if npcid is not that id<br>
walktoplayer_toattack();</p>
