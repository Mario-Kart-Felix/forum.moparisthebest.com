    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/killing-people-who-arent-in-jail-and-are-not-staff/277583</link>
    <description>Id like to apply a deathstage to people who are not jailed, but in they jail area and that are not staff. id understand how to set up the coords, just not applying it to people who are jailed as it doe not change their char settings?

<p>Wow thanks, will that not kill everyone who is in the jail coordinates though? i need the people who have actually been jailed to stay alive 0.0</p>
