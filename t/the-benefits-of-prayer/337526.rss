    <title>The benefits of prayer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-benefits-of-prayer/337526</link>
    <description>Since MITB&#39;s topic got inundated with off topic comments I have decided to make a new thread to discuss the benefits of prayer. Myself, and I&#39;m sure everyone else in this community, wish MITB&#39;s Dad good health.

This thread is about religion and its benefit with regards to ill health. Please do not criticize, mention or imply anything with regards to MITB&#39;s Dad. His family is in a difficult time at the moment and they deserve respect.

So begin the religious flame war.
I&#39;ll kick off:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An 11-year-old girl died after her parents prayed for healing rather than seek medical help for a treatable form of diabetes, police said Tuesday.
....
The girl has three siblings, ranging in age from 13 to 16, the police chief said.

&quot;They are still in the home,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no reason to remove them. There is no abuse or signs of abuse that we can see.&quot;
....&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These people are not fit to be parents.</description>

              <p>It’s kinda like a story I was told a while back when I went to church with mom and dad.</p>
<p>"A man was at his house and a flash flood hit.  His neighbor stops by and says “Do you need a ride?” the man replies “No, god will save me.”.  The water got up to the mans second story, he’s hanging out the upstairs-window, a boat arrives “Sir, come with us, we’ll take you to safety” the man replies “No, god will save me.”.  The man is sitting on his roof and a boat comes up and says “Sir, get on we’ll take you to safety” he replies “No, god will save me.” The man drowns and is getting his final judgment.  He asks god “God, why did you not save me?” God replied: “I sent your neighbor to help you out and two more boats, you wouldn’t accept my help”</p>
<p>I think it means a lot.</p>

              <p>According to most Christians, “God has a plan for everyone”. If it is his plan for a person to die at a certain time, why the fuck would praying to this almighty god make him change his mind?</p>
<p>If you say you are not praying for a person to get better, but rather for a person to go to heaven, it’s not like anything you could say would suddenly make god decide not to send them to hell. Since god is apparently omniscient, and going to heaven or hell is based on what you did in your lifetime, surely god would know a lot more about what the person did than you ever could.</p>
<p>I can understand it makes people feel better inside and come to terms with someone dying, but surely there are better and more constructive ways of doing that?</p>

He is obviously smarter than you, and whatever you think is wrong could actually be a key piece to his plan for Humanity, so theres no point.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if he is all knowing, and has everything planned out, every last detail, then why bother creating anything. He obviously knows whats going to happen.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">OR</span> we could think like non-retards, and realise that scientific evidence, and logic pretty much prove that there is no omniscient being watching over us and controlling everything. I don’t know about you guys, but when was the last time you heard of ANY prayer that came true that wasn’t just a coincidence? Praying for someones health will do shit all, medicine and science is what heals them, if it is possible.</p>

I have lot Christian friends and one of them explained Deuteronomy 6:16 for me.<br>
To pray for help is not to put God to the test, but I think trying to prove by science is, since you except an answer.</p>
<p>I have my doubt, but so long you not replace medical help with prayer it do no harm.</p>

Some prayed-for patients fared worse than those who did not receive prayers.<br>

“It seems more probable that those patients who knew they were being prayed for suffered additional stress in consequence: ‘performance anxiety’, as the experimenters put it.

              <p>Since MITB’s topic got inundated with off topic comments I have decided to make a new thread to discuss the benefits of prayer. Myself, and I’m sure everyone else in this community, wish MITB’s Dad good health.</p>
<p>This thread is about religion and its benefit with regards to ill health. Please do not criticize, mention or imply anything with regards to MITB’s Dad. His family is in a difficult time at the moment and they deserve respect.</p>

....
The girl has three siblings, ranging in age from 13 to 16, the police chief said.
<p>“They are still in the home,” he said. “There is no reason to remove them. There is no abuse or signs of abuse that we can see.”<br>

These people are not fit to be parents.
