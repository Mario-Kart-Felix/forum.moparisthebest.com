    <title>Guide to a Pure (1defence) (Using Rsbots)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/guide-to-a-pure-1defence-using-rsbots/360851</link>
    <description>Getting Started.

Training a pure can be difficult and Rewarding. The best things to do before you quest is to head on up to Clay and mine till about 20 mining, You&#39;ll Make 100k. Buy iron armour set, Mithril, Adamant, Rune Scimitar. (reason no bronze/iron is because you should do Vampire slayer witch will give you 20 Attack) and some Bronze arrows. Now head on up to Seagulls

Seagulls are located at the Portsarim Docks. They Have a max hit of 1 and will never hit you in iron. They are 8Hp each and drop nothing of value but will get you 40 Attack and Strength in notime.

Once you get 40 Attack And Strength Sell your Scimitars and buy All bows, Full leather, and as many Bronze arrows as you can. (if they don&#39;t sell buy some from the varrock store and wait for yours to come).
Use your arrows at Seagulls, 1k should get you roughly 30-35 Ranged.
Now Mine Some Iron untill 50 Mining. You&#39;ll make roughly 200k-300k.
Do Imp Catcher, Witch&#39;s potion and the Stronghold of Safety and you&#39;ll get about 14 Mage.
Buy 5k Mind runes, 1 Air Staff and head to the Lesser Demon at the Wizards Tower.
AutoFighter Pro or Afk it legitly You Decide. You should end up with 30 Magic, 35 Ranged, 40 Attack, 40 Strength.

[center][size=36pt][glow=red,2,300]Pay to Play training.[/glow][/size][/center]
Loads of money making ways to do this here are alot of commonly done ones:
Desert Goats 30k Xp 150k cash ph
Al-karid Warriors 100k-300k cash Ph 20k xp
Chaos druids (edgevile) 250k 20k xp ph
Chaos Druids (Yanile) 400k - 25k 
Aviansie (Prayer)30k 200k-300k
Flesh Crawlers 30k 200k-400k
Soulwars 50k 0gp

I did goats from, 40 attack, 40 strength 35 range to all  70&#39;s at goats (exept for attack witch i quested). I made alot of money, about 5m-8m
Once you have 70 range, do some Prayer Aviansie till 75 (if you don&#39;t have prayer, killing chaos druids will do)
60 attack and Strength You have your Dragon Scimitar God book, Black d&#39;hide chaps. Train at these spots. With trout, Lobster, Aviansie with prayer. 
If you have a Verry low budget i&#39;d do SoulWars for 100 Zeal, getting you about 50-55 Magic from 35. Once you have 40+ Do Mage Training Arena for mage exp and cash. (See bottom of this page for my Mage Training Guide).

Getting Money on a pure can be quite tough, especially if you have no items.
Go to bob&#39;s axes in Lumbridge, turn pikey mode on and take the free Bronze pickaxe and Bronze hatchet.

Woodcut to about 20 on Normal logs and sell to buy mithril and adamant.
[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/6153/100506233012.png[/img]


Mine to about 20 on Clay and buy mithril, adamant and rune pickaxe.
I&#39;d suggest getting 60-70 in both of these skills, they are great money makers.
[img]http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/3458/100524010010.png[/img]

Tanning Hides can be anything from 100k f2p to 500k P2P per hour. You just need 2 know what one is best.
Tanning 1 hide costs 20Gp. Add 20gp to the cost of the Untanned hide and then check the price of the Tanned hide. If you profit, do it.
[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/4906/100405155236.png[/img]

70 Thieving is a great source of money. You can rake in 5m and get a nice stat to 70. 1-25 Women at varrock 25-38 Ardy Warriors 38-99 Master farmers at Draynor.


Flax spinning is Great. 19k Xp ph with 230k Cash ph. Brilliant way to make cash. Do this in a PvP world Lumbridge. It&#39;s a safe zone and nobody will think to find you there.
[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/6234/100611230425.png[/img]

Smithing Cannon balls is about 10k exp Ph with 100k Cash ph!
No pic for this :(

Sorceress Guarden is a Great way to make cash. Its the Non-cb GDK Imo. 3k Farm xp ph and 300k cash ph, Epic or what?!^_^

[b]Thanks to mining bot for letting me use this pic. Yes that is 55M gained![/b]
Picking Flax is a nice way to make money if you don&#39;t have SwampToads (witch is a waste of cash atm)

[center][size=36pt][shadow=red,left]To Pray or not to Pray[/shadow][/size][/center]
Getting Prayer on a pure Mainly is down to 2 things,
If your going to do bosses such as Godwars, Fire cape or
If you are going to Nh pk or if you dont want to be rushed in PvP/BH.

Imo, prayer is worth it. Godwars, Fire Cape are just to good 2 miss out on. Barrows is even easily done on a 1 defence pure. Aviansies are good 2 do to.

Prayer is a downside on one thing imo. Combat level. A pures aim IMO is to stay the lowest combat with nice Pking stats. Praying will not help this. Although you do need 13 Prayer to do Desert Treasure.

[center][size=24pt][glow=cyan,2,300]Defence?!?![/glow][/size][/center]
Getting 2 Defence will not make you &quot;ruined&quot;  infact most sucsessful pures have had some slips. Dutch Lmfao got 3 defence, Bonesaw Pk is 21, Wtf_elvemage gotten 46 Before Turmoil. Just don&#39;t let the Fact of a defence level change your mind about staying a pure. Being a pure is Great. Only get 45 Defence when you feel you are ready. Basicly when you have time to do quests, Torso and if you don&#39;t have AutoPestcontrol Pro time to get void. Barrows gloves are not 100% needed but they make you look better than some faggy little bracelet. Rune Gloves arn&#39;t the best for a rune pure but are a pritty decent glove to wear. 20 Defence pures can also wear rune gloves.

Berserker pures also have enough Defence to Abyssal Runecraft. Also GDK and tank Aviansie. And do much better GWD. But take it from me. We get Faggy targets that think they are pro because they pray your dds spec, ROL, Farcast and cry about venge. Pures imo have alot of Honour. When i was a pure people ate, never prayed. People Didn&#39;t safe much. 90% of people were willing to DM.</description>

<p>I suggest getting ranged/magic, as both are fairly easy to train and magic you won’t get too much exp.

<p>Trust me I have been through like 4 pures.[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree but the quests are designed for people who want to do dt and such and most people want 50-60 attack so thats why</p>

Loads of money making ways to do this here are alot of commonly done ones:<br>
Desert Goats 30k Xp 150k cash ph<br>
Al-karid Warriors 100k-300k cash Ph 20k xp<br>
Chaos druids (edgevile) 250k 20k xp ph<br>
Chaos Druids (Yanile) 400k - 25k<br>
Aviansie (Prayer)30k 200k-300k<br>
Flesh Crawlers 30k 200k-400k<br>
Soulwars 50k 0gp</p>
<p>I did goats from, 40 attack, 40 strength 35 range to all  70’s at goats (exept for attack witch i quested). I made alot of money, about 5m-8m<br>
Once you have 70 range, do some Prayer Aviansie till 75 (if you don’t have prayer, killing chaos druids will do)<br>
60 attack and Strength You have your Dragon Scimitar God book, Black d’hide chaps. Train at these spots. With trout, Lobster, Aviansie with prayer.<br>
If you have a Verry low budget i’d do SoulWars for 100 Zeal, getting you about 50-55 Magic from 35. Once you have 40+ Do Mage Training Arena for mage exp and cash. (See bottom of this page for my Mage Training Guide).<br>

Getting Money on a pure can be quite tough, especially if you have no items.<br>
Go to bob’s axes in Lumbridge, turn pikey mode on and take the free Bronze pickaxe and Bronze hatchet.</p>
<p>Woodcut to about 20 on Normal logs and sell to buy mithril and adamant.<br>
<img src="http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/6153/100506233012.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Mine to about 20 on Clay and buy mithril, adamant and rune pickaxe.<br>
I’d suggest getting 60-70 in both of these skills, they are great money makers.<br>
<img src="http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/3458/100524010010.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Tanning Hides can be anything from 100k f2p to 500k P2P per hour. You just need 2 know what one is best.<br>
Tanning 1 hide costs 20Gp. Add 20gp to the cost of the Untanned hide and then check the price of the Tanned hide. If you profit, do it.<br>
<img src="http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/4906/100405155236.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>70 Thieving is a great source of money. You can rake in 5m and get a nice stat to 70. 1-25 Women at varrock 25-38 Ardy Warriors 38-99 Master farmers at Draynor.</p>
<p>Flax spinning is Great. 19k Xp ph with 230k Cash ph. Brilliant way to make cash. Do this in a PvP world Lumbridge. It’s a safe zone and nobody will think to find you there.<br>
<img src="http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/6234/100611230425.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Smithing Cannon balls is about 10k exp Ph with 100k Cash ph!<br>
No pic for this <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Sorceress Guarden is a Great way to make cash. Its the Non-cb GDK Imo. 3k Farm xp ph and 300k cash ph, Epic or what?!<img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

Picking Flax is a nice way to make money if you don’t have SwampToads (witch is a waste of cash atm)<br>

[center][size=36pt][shadow=red,left]To Pray or not to Pray[/shadow][/size][/center]<br>
Getting Prayer on a pure Mainly is down to 2 things,<br>
If your going to do bosses such as Godwars, Fire cape or<br>
If you are going to Nh pk or if you dont want to be rushed in PvP/BH.</p>
<p>Imo, prayer is worth it. Godwars, Fire Cape are just to good 2 miss out on. Barrows is even easily done on a 1 defence pure. Aviansies are good 2 do to.</p>
<p>Prayer is a downside on one thing imo. Combat level. A pures aim IMO is to stay the lowest combat with nice Pking stats. Praying will not help this. Although you do need 13 Prayer to do Desert Treasure.</p>
<p>[center][size=24pt][glow=cyan,2,300]Defence?!?![/glow][/size][/center]<br>
Getting 2 Defence will not make you “ruined”  infact most sucsessful pures have had some slips. Dutch Lmfao got 3 defence, Bonesaw Pk is 21, Wtf_elvemage gotten 46 Before Turmoil. Just don’t let the Fact of a defence level change your mind about staying a pure. Being a pure is Great. Only get 45 Defence when you feel you are ready. Basicly when you have time to do quests, Torso and if you don’t have AutoPestcontrol Pro time to get void. Barrows gloves are not 100% needed but they make you look better than some faggy little bracelet. Rune Gloves arn’t the best for a rune pure but are a pritty decent glove to wear. 20 Defence pures can also wear rune gloves.</p>
<p>Berserker pures also have enough Defence to Abyssal Runecraft. Also GDK and tank Aviansie. And do much better GWD. But take it from me. We get Faggy targets that think they are pro because they pray your dds spec, ROL, Farcast and cry about venge. Pures imo have alot of Honour. When i was a pure people ate, never prayed. People Didn’t safe much. 90% of people were willing to DM.</p>
