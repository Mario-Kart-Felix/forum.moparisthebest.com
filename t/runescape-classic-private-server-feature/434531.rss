              <p>takes the fun away from pking. pjing was ment to give the guy with the lower stats a chance (like 99 1 99 vs 2 people with 40 1 70) the 99 1 99 would prolly 3 hit both of them but with pjing gives them a chance</p>

              <p>Very interesting idea. I wouldn’t smash it instantly, rather give it a beta test.<br>
If this was to be tested lets say in rsce I wouldn’t agree with the prayer recharge since all the altars are one teleport away. In rsc tho I’d love it. It would feel so rewarding to get full prayer after a kill because you wouldn’t have to walk to monks.</p>
<p>Hp recharge would change pking quite a lot so I’d have that tested. This CANNOT!!! be done in a server with portals in wild. I can see the bastards in rsce bring low hp accounts to castle so they would get full hp in a tense situation. ~20% Regeneration could work. Can’t see anyone bothering to abuse it for such a small advantage.</p>

<p>But i think it should be related to the opponent cb level. I mean if i pk spmeone with 10 lvls lower i should not be getting a full hp restore. Maybe 50% if cb level is the same between both? if the kill is lower then decrease and if higher then increase the %.</p>

</aside>
<p>This. Or only hp regenned if there is a character within 5 sqs of your character once a kill is made. (if main objective is to curb pjing)</p>
