[url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,658220.0.html]We&#39;ve gone public![/url]

Ambience is a Runescape Private Server that originally began development around two years ago as of August.
We were originally named [URL=http://&quot;www.google.com/forums/showthread.php?83681-Evolution-X&quot;]Evolution-X[/URL] and we&#39;re simply picking up where we left off on Evolution-X, 
with much more in mind. The project began using a Dementhium base with as little added as possible
to leave a lot of space for innovation.The server was never completed to the standards we wanted due
to new responsibilities the team members had to take care of, however we did go public at one point. 
Around December of last year the team found a lack of time to get on the computer, as a result we had 
to shutdown and the entire team left the private server community. Around June, I got in touch with as 
many of the old team members as possible and notified them that I&#39;d be starting up the old project again
around the start of the new school year. Due to the excitement of many of the team members and players,
and the new development capabilities of our team after their time independently studying, as well as the 
incredible amount of suggestions being sent in, we got a jump start on production around the beginning of 
August. Since the project resumed production we&#39;ve programmed tons of neat features, with plenty more in 
store. We&#39;ve also rewritten a lot of the server&#39;s code, creating a lot of new security protocols, for the server 
itself as well as players accounts. 

You may be thinking to yourself, hmm I see a lot of RS2011 Remakes, what makes this different? The difference is, this server is not based off of that RS2011 Remake release, and we do not intend to remake runescape 2011. I&#39;m here for a private server, [B][U]NOT RUNESCAPE.[/U] This is [color=navy][U]Ambience 639.[/U][/color][/B]

[U]GUI Panel[/U]
The GUI panel was created entirely by me, it was originally developed a year ago when we first opened Evolution-X, it originally had a terrible frame that looked like it belonged on Windows XP, once we shut down Evolution-X I took a new direction with java, gaining a great understanding of the logic behind it, a newfound skill for developing Swing Applications, and increased my knowledge of the resources available to me through the standard Java libraries, as well as many external libraries offered across the web.
[IMG]http://i977.photobucket.com/albums/ae252/roflmaodude1/Ambience639/GUIPanel_zpsa84fec6e.png[/img]



[U]Website Launcher[/U]
The website launcher was originally an idea offered to me by my site developer Mike during development of Evolution-X, he thought it would be a unique addition, however; at the time I didn&#39;t understand external libraries very well so a lot of the features of standard Web Browsers wouldn&#39;t work, after doing some research in my off time developing Java swing applications I came across a library that would offer the resources I needed to create a top of the line website application as an executable Jar file, the only issue I came across was integrating it to the client in a way that would support the use of both a 64-bit Virtual Machine as well as a 32-bit Virtual Machine, there was a simple solution to this problem with the standard java library, as you can see the program is functional, however the client with the integration has not yet been released for use by BetaTesters.

[U]Warrior&#39;s Dungeon[/U]
To kick off the new project, the team decided they wanted to do something entirely custom for the server, which brought forth the Warrior&#39;s Dungeon, initially intended to be a little area holding some NPCs for training, ultimately leading to the creation of our custom quest Exorcising Revenants; a quest to a great plot to gain access to the Forinthry Dungeon, the Boxing Ring, and 2 PVP Zones within the dungeon.
[IMG]http://i977.photobucket.com/albums/ae252/roflmaodude1/Ambience639/warriors_zps6e02dc4e.png[/img]



[U]Boxing Ring[/U]
The boxing ring is a simple addition, to be followed by the combat and fencing ring in the future. Meant purely for entertainment.
[IMG]http://i977.photobucket.com/albums/ae252/roflmaodude1/Ambience639/boxing_zpsb79eef06.png[/img]



[U]Exorcising Revenants[/U]
When we were almost finished creating the Warriors Dungeon, we had a section that was entirely empty, we were thinking of  adding Revenants in this section but I figured, why put something like that in a little custom dungeon, this being said Jordan immediately had the idea to create a custom quest, more of a Master quest. The Exorcising Revenants quest has features of modified versions of Runescape quests, just because they fit into the plot as we were going, originally the quest could be done in 15 minutes with one boss fight, seeing this being such a short quest we started spewing out ideas leading to several weeks of developing this quest, the initial boss was reprogrammed, making it a much harder battle, skin of the teeth win for even a maxed player, with several other boss fights increasing in difficulty through the progression of the quest. I tried to give Web-Developer Mike a quick walkthrough of this quest in an hour and a half before he had to go, we used Perfect rings and teleported to the key areas of the quest. [U]In the end we ran out of time and had to skip more than half the quest.[/U] There is a lot of plot behind it, a lot of coding went into it, completing it was a very satisfying success and it has been considered the official kickstarter of the project.

[U]Bones On Altar[/U]
Bones on Altar is fully functional, proper player animation and Graphics on Object. We won&#39;t be using Guilded altars as we have not yet programmed Construction and I find it pointless to have a random Guilded Altar spawned when there&#39;s plenty of standard altars.
[IMG]http://i977.photobucket.com/albums/ae252/roflmaodude1/Ambience639/bonesonaltar_zpsf3eca528.png[/img]



[U]Quick Prayers[/U]
Quick Prayers are fully functional, the glitch with cross-prayerbook quick prayers has been fixed, as well as the proper disabling of Quick Prayers when out of prayer points.
[IMG]http://i977.photobucket.com/albums/ae252/roflmaodude1/Ambience639/quickprayers_zps54cfa839.png[/img]


[U]Rune Crafting[/U]
Rune Crafting altars are accessible using the Tunnels in the Abyss, all Altars are fully functional granting the proper rune bonus as you increase levels.
[IMG]http://i977.photobucket.com/albums/ae252/roflmaodude1/Ambience639/Runecrafting_zps1c7f072f.png[/img]



[U]Cooking[/U]
There are multiple methods of cooking throughout the server, you can chop down a tree and light a fire, or access one of the many ranges throughout the server, nearly all ranges are working.

[U]Equipment Screen[/U]
When we got the server, there were many dupes and item loss glitches throughout the server. The Equipment screen didn&#39;t display the proper render animation, there was a lot of bugs through our interfaces. Price checker had dupes, the Duel arena interfaces were beyond buggy, there were loading errors with client frame sizes that would end up forcing the players to reload their clients, trading was pretty buggy. We have spent a great deal of time fixing bugs throughout the server, so I&#39;ll show you guys some of our interfaces properly written, more to come.

<p>Ambience is a Runescape Private Server that originally began development around two years ago as of August.<br>
We were originally named <a data-bbcode="true">Evolution-X</a> and we’re simply picking up where we left off on Evolution-X,<br>
with much more in mind. The project began using a Dementhium base with as little added as possible<br>
to leave a lot of space for innovation.The server was never completed to the standards we wanted due<br>
to new responsibilities the team members had to take care of, however we did go public at one point.<br>
Around December of last year the team found a lack of time to get on the computer, as a result we had<br>
to shutdown and the entire team left the private server community. Around June, I got in touch with as<br>
many of the old team members as possible and notified them that I’d be starting up the old project again<br>
around the start of the new school year. Due to the excitement of many of the team members and players,<br>
and the new development capabilities of our team after their time independently studying, as well as the<br>
incredible amount of suggestions being sent in, we got a jump start on production around the beginning of<br>
August. Since the project resumed production we’ve programmed tons of neat features, with plenty more in<br>
store. We’ve also rewritten a lot of the server’s code, creating a lot of new security protocols, for the server<br>
itself as well as players accounts.</p>
<p>You may be thinking to yourself, hmm I see a lot of RS2011 Remakes, what makes this different? The difference is, this server is not based off of that RS2011 Remake release, and we do not intend to remake runescape 2011. I’m here for a private server, <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">NOT RUNESCAPE.</span> This is [color=navy]<span class="bbcode-u">Ambience 639.</span>[/color]</span></p>

<p><span class="bbcode-u">GUI Panel</span><br>
The GUI panel was created entirely by me, it was originally developed a year ago when we first opened Evolution-X, it originally had a terrible frame that looked like it belonged on Windows XP, once we shut down Evolution-X I took a new direction with java, gaining a great understanding of the logic behind it, a newfound skill for developing Swing Applications, and increased my knowledge of the resources available to me through the standard Java libraries, as well as many external libraries offered across the web.<br>
<img src="http://i977.photobucket.com/albums/ae252/roflmaodude1/Ambience639/GUIPanel_zpsa84fec6e.png" alt width="320" height="320"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Website Launcher</span><br>
The website launcher was originally an idea offered to me by my site developer Mike during development of Evolution-X, he thought it would be a unique addition, however; at the time I didn’t understand external libraries very well so a lot of the features of standard Web Browsers wouldn’t work, after doing some research in my off time developing Java swing applications I came across a library that would offer the resources I needed to create a top of the line website application as an executable Jar file, the only issue I came across was integrating it to the client in a way that would support the use of both a 64-bit Virtual Machine as well as a 32-bit Virtual Machine, there was a simple solution to this problem with the standard java library, as you can see the program is functional, however the client with the integration has not yet been released for use by BetaTesters.<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-u">Warrior’s Dungeon</span><br>
To kick off the new project, the team decided they wanted to do something entirely custom for the server, which brought forth the Warrior’s Dungeon, initially intended to be a little area holding some NPCs for training, ultimately leading to the creation of our custom quest Exorcising Revenants; a quest to a great plot to gain access to the Forinthry Dungeon, the Boxing Ring, and 2 PVP Zones within the dungeon.<br>
<img src="http://i977.photobucket.com/albums/ae252/roflmaodude1/Ambience639/warriors_zps6e02dc4e.png" alt width="320" height="320"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Boxing Ring</span><br>
The boxing ring is a simple addition, to be followed by the combat and fencing ring in the future. Meant purely for entertainment.<br>
<img src="http://i977.photobucket.com/albums/ae252/roflmaodude1/Ambience639/boxing_zpsb79eef06.png" alt width="320" height="320"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Exorcising Revenants</span><br>
When we were almost finished creating the Warriors Dungeon, we had a section that was entirely empty, we were thinking of  adding Revenants in this section but I figured, why put something like that in a little custom dungeon, this being said Jordan immediately had the idea to create a custom quest, more of a Master quest. The Exorcising Revenants quest has features of modified versions of Runescape quests, just because they fit into the plot as we were going, originally the quest could be done in 15 minutes with one boss fight, seeing this being such a short quest we started spewing out ideas leading to several weeks of developing this quest, the initial boss was reprogrammed, making it a much harder battle, skin of the teeth win for even a maxed player, with several other boss fights increasing in difficulty through the progression of the quest. I tried to give Web-Developer Mike a quick walkthrough of this quest in an hour and a half before he had to go, we used Perfect rings and teleported to the key areas of the quest. <span class="bbcode-u">In the end we ran out of time and had to skip more than half the quest.</span> There is a lot of plot behind it, a lot of coding went into it, completing it was a very satisfying success and it has been considered the official kickstarter of the project.<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-u">Bones On Altar</span><br>
Bones on Altar is fully functional, proper player animation and Graphics on Object. We won’t be using Guilded altars as we have not yet programmed Construction and I find it pointless to have a random Guilded Altar spawned when there’s plenty of standard altars.<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-u">Quick Prayers</span><br>
Quick Prayers are fully functional, the glitch with cross-prayerbook quick prayers has been fixed, as well as the proper disabling of Quick Prayers when out of prayer points.<br>

Rune Crafting altars are accessible using the Tunnels in the Abyss, all Altars are fully functional granting the proper rune bonus as you increase levels.<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-u">Cooking</span><br>
There are multiple methods of cooking throughout the server, you can chop down a tree and light a fire, or access one of the many ranges throughout the server, nearly all ranges are working.<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-u">Equipment Screen</span><br>
When we got the server, there were many dupes and item loss glitches throughout the server. The Equipment screen didn’t display the proper render animation, there was a lot of bugs through our interfaces. Price checker had dupes, the Duel arena interfaces were beyond buggy, there were loading errors with client frame sizes that would end up forcing the players to reload their clients, trading was pretty buggy. We have spent a great deal of time fixing bugs throughout the server, so I’ll show you guys some of our interfaces properly written, more to come.<br>
