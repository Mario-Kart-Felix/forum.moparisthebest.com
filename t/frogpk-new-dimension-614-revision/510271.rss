    <title>FrogPk | New Dimension | 614 Revision</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/frogpk-new-dimension-614-revision/510271</link>
    <description>Welcome MoparScape. You may know me on my other two accounts &quot;BentonScape&quot; and &quot;JoesServers&quot; But please no longer message me on those as this is my new main account.

Today i just wanted to show you my new development that im taking out again. I used to host an awesome server called FrogPk but sadly it didnt reach the number 100-1 page on mmorpgtoplist so i got rid of the server. I had about 30 players with me then and i loved them all for playing and helping me out by voting.

Hamachi Chat: FrogPk
Password: 123

Please join that for all new server updates and to ask me anything about the server like how to play and become staff and stuff. Im trying to keep the server advertisement to a minimum here so im going to say no more about it.

[hr]

Development Team:

Owner, Coder, Web Designer, Developer and Hoster:
Joe
Co-Owner and Server Helper:
Blake

All other staff spots and dev spots are open.

[hr]

Server Information and Features:

_Skills:
All standard skills are 80-100% working, with no bugs or glitches to there name.
Extra skills that have been added: Pking, Dungeoneering, Hunting and Summoning are also 80-100% completed.

So most of the skills are working fine.

_Items:
All the new 614-688 Have been added including Dragon (sp) and (or).

_Intetfaces:
All of the new interfaces are done including new teleport tabs, A new banking system with tabs and search bar. The equiptment stats and the items kept on death interfaces have also been updates.
The gameframe is 652 i think, and the tab area is the new blue colored 714+ one. The new Alert system has also been added, featuring the new box that actuly comes up and down.

_Emotes:
All the new combat emotes have been added and all the new special attack emotes have been added. The emote icons have been updated through my cache, And the emotions have also been updated.

Thats all for now, Any questions or if you want to help out in the dev team just chat me on the hamachi above...

Please dont hate or nothing and keep the discussing friendly. Please post some new ideas below and ill take some photos of the server now. Thanks for viewing.</description>
