    <title>Switch to drop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/switch-to-drop/462465</link>
    <description>i&#39;m using insidiaxv2 and when you are randomly click an item, it has a chance to randomly drop..

other explanations: Sometimes when I try to equip a item it just randomly drops it..?
I&#39;ve looked through the wearitem code but I can&#39;t find anything that would cause this complication.
Does anyone know where I need to look for this?

other: Hey guys , I&#39;am using InsidiaX v2 sometimes when u equip items they drop on the ground lets say we are trying to wield rune 2h And instead option Wield it shows option drop for some reason don&#39;t know how to explain it better ;/ Does any1 haz fix for this badly need this

and last one: Okay say you&#39;re pking, you switch to a different armor set or maybe even eat food, randomly it drops the item you click. Anyone know a fix? Please reply, much appreciated.</description>
