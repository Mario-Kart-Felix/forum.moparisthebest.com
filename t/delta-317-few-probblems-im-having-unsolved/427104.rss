    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-317-few-probblems-im-having-unsolved/427104</link>
    <description>ive made a 317 rsps using the dragon-history base and im having a few problems.

1.ive added a custom shield but when i try to spawn ingame it appears in the weapon slot i&#39;ve tried adding it to the item.java but it still doesnt work properly.

2. npc&#39;s hit to high: when im fighting a npc say a level 43 (i&#39;m at level 126) they still manage to kill/nearly kill me. anybody know how to solve this problem 

3. disconnecting when in combat: when i try to attack a npc the game freezes and disconnects i thought it was just cus i was spawning npc&#39;s but even if i try to attack a normal npc it freezes. any ideas??

4.errors when compiling: i&#39;ve added a &quot;donator&quot; command to the client.java that teleports you to the donator zone and if you&#39;re not at donator status it sends the message &quot;you need to donate to teleport here&quot; when i compiled it said 1 error &quot;;&quot; expected so i went back added the &quot;;&quot; complied and i get 100 errors. anybody know how to solve this.


Sorry for any spelling mistakes so don&#39;t try to flame me by saying &quot;you misspelled .....&quot;
Appreciate any help on any of my questions.

Edit: if any of these problems are unsolvable then i can start again it isn&#39;t a major problem.</description>
