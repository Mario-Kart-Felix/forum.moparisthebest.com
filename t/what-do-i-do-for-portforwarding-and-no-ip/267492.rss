    <title>What do I do for portforwarding and no-ip?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-i-do-for-portforwarding-and-no-ip/267492</link>
    <description>Ok, i downloaded no-ip duc v 2.2.1 and it&#39;s updating my host thing. But what does that stuff have to do with my server? How do they connect so you can use my server ip (flamedfury.no-ip.biz) and play on my server? I don&#39;t get it. And if I don&#39;t have a router then how do I portforward to let people play on my server?</description>

              <p>Right, There is something called “Port forwarding” this means other people can access your router enabling them to connect to your server, what you need to do is “Open” it, first look at what kind of router you’ve got, if your wondering what one of those is it’s where your internet is coming from in your house, for example if it’s “Netgear” as what mine is go onto the search bar on this forum and type in “Netgear port forwarding” and somewhere there will be a tutorial explaining everything you need to know as of how i did it.</p>
