    <title>Disscussion On Nulls</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/disscussion-on-nulls/111952</link>
    <description>I know you might have problems with nulls on your server, as so am i, but only a few thankfully. so i found a way to get rid of them! or so i think... if you ever looked at your players online list, it says:

The Name:

&quot;Null&quot;

and the coordinates of:
-1, -1.

well the coords you might not see, but for me you do because its a custom menu...Anyways!

i made this! Which would indefinitely stop the nulls from being &quot;registered as online&quot; but it won&#39;t stop them from logging in..

[code]if(absX == -1 || absY == -1) {
disconnected = true;
}[/code]

That should stop the nulls! but as you might know or not, that when you log onto the server your registered as the coordinates -1, -1. you know, when you have that black screen? yeah you have those coordinates..Anyways the peice of code i put above would disconnect you!! so we have to put it in a place where it is delayed about 5 or 7 seconds, which I dont know! i tried to use my no lag timer, but its only 1.5 secs. which isn&#39;t enough i tried changing up the numbers but not luck, dunno why. 

Now another part:

to differentiate the Nulls From the Actual Players:

[code]if(absX == -1 || absY == -1) {
heightLevel = 0;
teleportToX = xcoord;
teleportToY = ycoord;
}[/code]

it would get rid of that black screen that you might get when logging onto a server. and of course it won&#39;t teleport nulls there -.-. i&#39;ve tried doesn&#39;t work lol..but i did get a rather unusual null, by the name of &quot;JJ&quot;, i checked the ip it was Local Host...and the password was the same as my password, so i really think nulls come from peoples computer, i mean the actual server owners! even saw the coords: -1, -1.

So please post suggestions on how to put in a place where its called, void perphaps? but i doubt it, anyways i&#39;m open to suggestions!</description>
