    <description>Need Beta Testers

Hi, I am building a web based application in PHP.

PhToRRent.

This application allows users to break files into parts and send them to other computers, or keep them and rebuild them later (sort of like a locked folder, but not).

It is currently in it&#39;s Beta 0.2.* Stage.

http://doognotna.co.nz/?page=phtorrent

[size=15pt]How to set up:[/size] - This part of the guide is only for Windows. I will post for other OS&#39;s later.
1. Go to http://doognotna.co.nz/?page=phtorrent and download the latest version of PhToRRent.
2. Go to http://www.wampserver.com/en/ and download/install the latest verion of WAMP.
3. Once WAMP is installed, click the icon in the taskbar, then click PHP, now click php.ini
4. Once php.ini is opened in notepad, search for 30. Replace that with something like 9000. Now search for [code]allow_url_fopen = Off[/code] and change that to:
[code]allow_url_fopen = On[/code]
Now save and close that file.
5. Click the WAMP icon in the taskbar and select restart all services.
6. Open port 80, or whatever port you installed wamp to work with.
7. Copy the PhToRRent files to C:\wamp\www or where ever you installed wamp.
8. Go to http://localhost/phtorrent If it shows up, you did something right.

[size=15pt]To split a file:[/size]
1. Put the file into C:\wamp\www\phtorrent
2. Go to http://localhost/phtorrent/split.html
3. Type in the files name, and how big each part is (Bytes).
4. Click enter
5. Wait for the page to load. It will display how many parts were created.

[size=15pt]How to rebuild a file:[/size]
1. Go to http://localhost/phtorrent/build.html
2. Enter the file&#39;s original name, then the new name of the file. Then how many parts.
3. Press enter.
4. Wait for the page to load.
5. Go to http://localhost/phtorrent/builds and download your built file.

[size=15pt]How to get a file:[/size]
1. Go to http://localhost/phtorrent/get.html
2. Enter the amount of parts the file has.
3. Enter the file&#39;s original name.
4. Enter the IP:PORT which the files are located
5. Press enter.
6. Wait for the page to load, once it has loaded, click the link it provides to download the file.

[size=15pt]To test if getting works:[/size]
1. Go to http://localhost/phtorrent/get/get.php?parts=500&amp;file=test.file&amp;domain=doognotna.co.nz
2. If that loads and says it is downloaded, you set it up right.
If you have any questions, ask.</description>

I dunno… Cutting private files into small bits so that people can’t see them, maybe…</p>
