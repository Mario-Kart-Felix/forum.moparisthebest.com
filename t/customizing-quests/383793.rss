    <title>Customizing quests</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/customizing-quests/383793</link>
    <description>hi... i need help with adding quests to my server and was wondering if someone could give me a step by step tutorial/guide that could tell me how to do so(or at least tell me where i can find one, and please dont say google it because i have already tried and i&#39;ve found no results whatsoever and if you dont believe me you can try it your self) i think it has some thing to do with quest.java and dialogues.cfg but i&#39;m not certain.

much appreciated.</description>
