    <title>Windows 7 OS I converted to Exe. Still wont work!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/windows-7-os-i-converted-to-exe-still-wont-work/379682</link>
    <description>Hello, I have converted my RUN.BAT to a RUN.EXE for my client, I run the source and my server members can connect, the only issue is that I cannot, when I run the client it opens up I get to log in, but once I click somewhere it closes out.

This is getting very frustrating.  This is what my RUN.BAT looks like: 
@ECHO OFF
color 81
title Dragon-History Client
echo Dragon-History Client
echo Made by Aintaro
JAVA -Xmx500m EGUI</description>

I’m assuming that your windows 7 computer is 64 bit right? You click anywhere and it disconnects on you? The problem doesn’t have to deal with your run.bat file. It deals with the JDK version you have. For some reason, when you download JDK, the 64 bit version doesn’t work with private servers…</p>
<p>With that said, uninstall your JDK. Reinstall it, but download the 32 bit version(It might just say windows).<br>

Wrong. I already told him &amp; fixed it for him. He couldn’t start up the client, he needs to set environmental variables in the future.[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh, he phrased the question wrong then.</p>
