              <p>Enji, if you want 753, go to: <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=657559.0" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=657559.0</a>   If you want 803, go to: <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=662768.0" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=662768.0</a>  If you need help with putting that together then reply. They both work, but the 803 is new and doesn’t have many features yet.</p>
<p>Turk, download Eclipse here <a href="https://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-standard-44/lunar" rel="nofollow noopener">https://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-standard-44/lunar</a> and select your OS on the right to download. Then, extract it wherever, open it, and where it says workspace select C:\WhereverYouSavedIt\FolderWithClientAndSource in there. So the folder that contains everything has 3 folders now, Source, Client, and something else. Click X on the tutorial/welcome tab, and right click under the left box and press New… Java Project, type the name EXACTLY!!! in the way you see on your client, press OK, then do it for your source/server. Now go in the folders manually wherever you saved them and edit the settings so the client goes on to the server, if it works, head back to Eclipse. Now right click the server, Run As Java Application, then select/search for Launcher. Now Press OK and it will run it (but you won’t see it, the log is at the bottom, under Console), now do the same for client, but instead of Launcher, you do Loader. Click OK/Next and it will launch up. Now at the login screen, X out of the client. Now right click the client, press Export, Java &gt; Runnable JAR File, press Next, make sure the top says Loader and NOT ANYTHING ELSE, if it does, click Loader. Select wherever you want to save the .JAR file, and select 'Package required libraries into generated .JAR (2nd option). Press Finish. If there are any errors let me know. If there are WARNINGS (NOT ERRORS) you are FINE. Close Eclipse out now, run the server bat file, and run the .jar. Success? You can redistribute it now. Anytime you update client, you have compile it and redo the Export part.</p>
