    <description>I need some help on coding the source called &#39;&#39;torvapkz v2&#39;&#39;, I want to know how to change the notification box that you get when you log in; for example, Welcome to torvapkz v2! I went to the file config.java and it&#39;s not there, I change every thing in there that involves torvapkz. Also my restart command does not work if you guys know a command to restart let me know, but for now I have been using my compiler to restart it every now and then. Also what&#39;s the file called to change the text in the quest tab sorry for not being specific I am a new coder. Please and thanks.
