    <title>Paypal for RSPS donations = bad idea</title>

    <description>http://blog.apparentsoft.com/business/124/is-paypal-good-for-your-microisv-business-a-short-paypal-horror-story/

After reading that blog post, it reminds me of the same sort of crap Paypal put me through. In my case it was mostly through charge backs from donators who had decided to quit/banned.

After spending several months having switched to Google Checkout to receive payments, they suspended my account too. (Long after I had stopped accepting donations) I suppose Google&#39;s excuse was that I needed to prove with documentation that I was a non-profit. Whatever. For those who deal with this, avoid both Paypal and Google Checkout. Paypal will freeze your account and keep the money if Jagex complains of copyright infringement (happened to servers here before) and Google Checkout likes to place every single incoming payment on hold while they verify it against fraud detection which takes between 10 minutes to several hours for each transaction. It also takes Google Checkout weeks to disburse the money sometimes.

http://www.authorize.net/advantage/ looks kind of good compared to the other two. I&#39;m not so much into the RSC server donation area anymore but I am still interested in indie game development.

What are some of the more popular ways of accepting payments that have worked well for you guys? (big RSC server owners)</description>
