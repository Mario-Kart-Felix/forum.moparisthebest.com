    <title>Need help with cleaning/old bugs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-cleaning-old-bugs/148728</link>
    <description>This looks like the best place to post it, so,

I&#39;m sure there are some people here who are familiar with old bugs that were around before all the children came to this site.
I&#39;ve made a pretty good scripting system for an old version of winterlove&#39;s server, but I need help from someone who knows the structure of the server, because I&#39;m not familiar with it and I was hoping someone who is wouldn&#39;t mind cleaning up any obvious dirty stuff, and fixing any old bugs.

I&#39;d do it myself, and I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s how it will end up happening.

I&#39;ll attach what I have so far, any optimizations/contributions would be rovery.

PS: dont give this to moparscapers

tl;dr: help me clean this thing</description>
