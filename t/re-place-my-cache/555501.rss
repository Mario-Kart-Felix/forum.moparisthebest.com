    <title>Re-place my cache?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/re-place-my-cache/555501</link>
    <description>So I have a cache that I&#39;m not happy about so I&#39;ve tried to find how to replace it but I&#39;ve had no luck. Can someone redirect me to a snippet or help me at all?</description>

              <p>There’s no in depth tutorial because it takes a lot of work to move one cache over to another client, unless they’re both parsing the cache values the exact same.</p>
<p>And speaking of that, that’s what you’ll have to do for it to work.</p>
<p>You’ll have to change all the “readValue” methods (At least, that’s what most are named) to that of the new cache.<br>
You’ll have to change all the code that reads any data from the cache, unless it’s the same - to put it simply.</p>
<p>If your client is reading anInt1047 as a byte but the new client is reading it as a short, you’ll have to change it.</p>
<p>It’s typically easier to just dump the data you want from the cache and put it into your existing client.</p>
<p>This also doesn’t account for making sure your client and server are both using the same protocol and packet structure. Some clients set the NPC update bits to 10 some set it to 14, etc…</p>
<p>TL;DR: This isn’t for people new to the RSPS scene.</p>
