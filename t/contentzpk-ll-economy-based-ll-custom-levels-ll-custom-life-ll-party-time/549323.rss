    <description>If your looking a server that has custom work, then your looking at the right post.  If your looking for a server with dedicated staff your looking at the right post.  If your looking for a server that mimics runescape your not looking in the right place.  There are several different ways that we differ from regular runescape.  We have custom max combat, custom potions, custom herb to make those potions, custom fishing, custom pking areas, custom mining, custom smithing, and we will always be adding more.  Here are a few pictures of our custom lifestyle at contentzpk.
