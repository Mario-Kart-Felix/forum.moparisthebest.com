        <p>Andrews response to my article in the <a href="http://tip.it/runescape/?times=77" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Tip.It times</a> was grouchyish:</p>
<blockquote>I feel this a little one-sided. To say we try to stop all emergent gameplay isn't true. We love emergent gameplay; there's emergent gameplay all over the place in RuneScape. In fact (unlikely many other developers) when we see players doing something cool we hadn't thought of, not only do we think "cool!", we also often go out of our way to make that cool thing work even better or build it in as an intended part of the game. How many developers do that?
<p>Examples of emergent gameplay: Law running on world 66. Players using shops as temporary banks when nature running (risk of losing your runes, vs slight speed boost! cool trade off!). The bizarrely high value of party hats. The huge player ‘market place’ which has emerged on worlds 1 and 2 in varrock.</p>
<p>Examples of emergent gameplay, where we’ve even tried to support it further. Players having drop parties, something we never originally thought of, but we added the drop party room to support it further. Of course you can still have a drop party the old way too. Clan wars in the wilderness - never a designed part of the game but we added in (optional) multi-way combat wilderness areas, and (optional) clan capes to try and make them more fun and are currently working on further clan related stuff to support this emergent gameplay further.</p>
<p>There are countless examples once you sit down and think about it. There are also lots (and lots) of small ones you wouldn’t even realize are there because they emerged so quickly and so widespread they have just become part of the game and everyone (including many of our own staff) just assumes we intended it to work that way. I haven’t been keeping a list of all the emergent things that have happened but if I had I’m pretty sure it would be truly enormous.</p>
<p>I actually find these “accidental features” one of the coolest things about developing a game like RuneScape, it’s always great to see players making their own fun.</p>
<p>Also don’t confuse balancing the game with trying to kill emergent gameplay. They aren’t the same thing. All decent MMORPGS try to ensure their game is balanced and for example if one weapon/character-class turns out to be totally overpowered compared to all others they will rebalance it to stop the game being ruined. There’s a subtle difference between “emergent gameplay” and “finding the fastest way of levelling at any one moment in time”. If the fastest way of levelling changes nothing has been spoilt, you just have to find the new fastest way!</p>
<p>I think you also need to make the distinction between emergent gameplay that improves the game (cool - leave it in, even support it in some cases), and emergent gameplay that actually totally spoils/unbalances it (best to be fixed). I would have thought this distinction a key part of any article on the subject.</p>
<p>And as for the “banning” accusation. I would like to point out that we didn’t ban people who made pure characters in rs-classic (your own example of emergent gameplay!), we don’t ban all the people law running on world 66. Neither of these is against the rules. Lets not start with the banning accusations all over again. Our policy is “if in doubt DONT ban”.</p>
<p>It’s a great topic for an article, but it’s a shame you didn’t also think about all the cool emergent things in the game, and try to consider both sides of the topic. More research next time please! Wink</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I just saw (tonight) that my article was even made into a tip.it times article or whatever, and that Andrew responded. So I quickly wrote this:</p>
<blockquote>There are a plethora of player created dynamics within Runescape that are well supported or at least tolerated by Jagex and it's right to say that Jagex does much to accommodate its players and embrace their style of play. However, some emergent gameplay opportunities have been abandoned and others only exist for lack of Jagex fleshing out the world appropriately.
<p>The switch from crisp 2D sprites to blocky 3D models in Runescape 3D never bothered me as much as the imprecise implentation of the combat system, which feels alot like the girl next door wearing fishnets; unnatural and forced. The ‘by the numbers’ ‘click and watch’ combat system that worked so well in Runescape simply wasn’t made for a real time 3D world, and though the dynamics have been severely altered, the gameplay experience and controls were not changed, resulting in a kind of Frankenstein monster. Help! I’m an awesome classic MUD stuck inside a harsh 3D world! Combined with the super-effectiveness of armour and the strategy-free multi-combat zones, the Runescape3D wilderness is tame and unable to support compelling new playerkilling strategies, not because the opportunity for innovation isn’t there, but the reward for innovation is sapped by lack of solid design.</p>
<p>There are many examples of player created gameplay emerging only because there is no real way to get things done otherwise. Gameplay that is not particularly creative, but simply aggravating. For example, training the ranged skill involves trapping enemies behind objects, where you slowly shoot them to death while they stand there emotionless (in Runescape 3D, the monsters flinch), and the marketplace in varrok is a nest for scammers and spammers, but there’s nowhere else to go. However, like the rarity of party hats, it’s doubtful whether the range training dynamic was overseen by Jagex. The lack of any monster AI to faciliate archery is only admissable if the game doesn’t require us to care about NPCs. This worked great in Runescape Classic where all the quests were frivolous or at least didn’t take themselves seriously.</p>
<p>I would be much more willing to believe that the RSC combat system was somehow “Fixed” and made more balanced, if it ever was. But the truth is that all classes had a chance to suceed in Runescape classic, mages, strength pures, well-rounded melee, rangers, all suceeeded at different levels, and the combat system was never significantly changed. And though pure melee characters were the best overall, the scimitar is the overall best weapon in Runescape 3D, and I hope that doesn’t mean it’s going to be crippled in the next version of Runescape?</p>
<p>There should be a strong distinction between emergent gameplay that helps the game become a more interesting and fun place to be, and emergent gameplay that leeches that fun away. Jagex is of course the ultimate arbiter of what hijinks us mortals are allowed once we pass through the sacred gates of Lloigh-enn, though we are allowed to yodel and bring our cell phones, as well as firearms if necessary. Everyone likes to have fun, but there is a fine line between baiting people to do the wrong thing and giving them a free world to explore.</p>
<p>Pure characters weren’t banned in RSC, but now everyone (ok, almost everyone) is banned from Runescape Classic, as you call it. Why? Too many cheaters. Also, players like me missed the boat to pay 5$, and got no second chance. Yet why doesn’t Jagex release the Runescape classic source? The players who want the sourcecode (and already have a slightly obfuscated version) are more than capable of setting up their own server with adequate cheating protection and running the game as it was intended, and they want to. The worst possible thing that could happen, random private servers with no relation to the original game spawning up, has already happened with minimal impact to Runescape3D. Wouldn’t it be better to release the official source of Runescape Classic and let it flourish in its old age?</p>
<p>Is it too much to ask for release of the Runescape sourcecode to the community that has loved and supported it for so many years? It’s an extremely old game, which could be revived by modifications and community support.</p>
<p>Edit: Some people have posted about a PaulT who posts on sketchy sites. I am not that PaulT. I do not post on sites that promote illegal activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope he decides to respond, and that idiots from moparisthebest don’t spam up that thread. Anyway, I hope you got a kick out of Andrew Gower trying to match wits with your own PaulT, you know that’s no real contest anyway.</p>
