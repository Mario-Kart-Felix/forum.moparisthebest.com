    <title>Server Console?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-console/280913</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to find something like a console where i can run the server and have a console that i can use to restart server, talk to people, kick people?

Like a call of duty Rcon but just with talk kick restart

I saw it on some sources but didn&#39;t know how.

When you click run the console thing opens with the cmd prompt

can anyone help me with this?  :|[br][br][size=1]Posted on: May 28, 2009, 06:19:51 pm[/size][hr]If you could instead of posting here could you PM it to me? this topic might get lost by the time i get back on in 2 hours :D</description>
