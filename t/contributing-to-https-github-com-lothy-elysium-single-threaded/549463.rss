    <description>I&#39;m told that at least one person has expressed interest in contributing to this project. That&#39;s fine.

Feel free to fork the project and contribute changes via the pull request mechanism. Keep each pull request&#39;s changes concise and related to one thing. If they&#39;re reasonable then I&#39;ll review them and include them in the main branch.

I&#39;m developing this in my own time, at my own leisure, so no rushing or hassling me.

<p>Not everyone can be bothered to write thousands of lines when you can write hundred.</p>
<p>EDIT: And this thread is not about RSCD, so if you want to talk about making script system for RSCD make another topic. Elysium is in early stages and anything can be done.</p>
<p>EDIT2: There’s not many things that the ‘script’ threads needs to be using concurrently with the main thread. It is mainly just setting off client updates and modifying inventory.</p>

Example? Using anything like what RSCD currently has needs to be ditched. You should be able to delay the script by 1 line and so far the best solution for that has been short lived threads per script which get killed after script is done.</p>

<p>I’ll add a licence file this afternoon. It’ll probably be GPLv3 or the BSD/MIT licence.<br>
What it won’t be is AGPL or similar where someone is compelled under licence to provide the source of any changes they make if they host those changes. It’s not like I have the financial capacity to enforce an AGPL licence anyway.</p>
<p>I’ll also add a readme.</p>
<p>And I use XML because it was there ready to copy and paste from the RSCD project. In my opinion there’s no reason to get caught up on how the entity data is stored at this point. In the future items and npcs will come from the database though, not from file.</p>

<p>The idiom for writing a script is quite simple:</p>

ScriptManager.registerItemOnItemScript(1, 1, ScriptManager.PRIORITY_DEFAULT,<br>

How are you going to do delays on scripts, e.g dialogues?</p>

              <p>I think you’re missing the point. The reason for a scripting system like this is so you don’t feel the need to wind up with one massive file that contains everything.<br>
Additionally, when implementing something such as a quest, all of the scripts for that particular quest can go in one file (or package, if the quest is substantial enough).</p>

It would be really interesting to modularize the project, with such things as a log in server, data server (for, example, loading npc/object/etc locations), friend server (might be redundant, as this could be implemented into a log in server).

Spoon feeding isn’t just about straight up giving the code, i it can also be giving step by step instructions(the solution) on doing something and giving the opponent no room to think for themselves.</p>
<p>The list would be fairly long but I can tell you that even the basic game mechanics of RSCD are wrong, things are handled at random times and sometimes that causes bugs, delay, and threading issues if you were to make it multi-threaded. The networking should be rewritten to like what Lothy has done on Elysium, but I would do things bit differently.  The walk to actions are using timed events to check if player is on the destination(it never crossed anybodys mind to check for that after moving the player?) :palm:. I don’t have enough time right now to list up more.</p>

              <p>It would be really interesting to modularize the project, with such things as a log in server, data server (for, example, loading npc/object/etc locations), friend server (might be redundant, as this could be implemented into a log in server). Of course, all of this should be completely optional to the people using the software.</p>

<p>Nobody forced you to post your elite code mang. I suggest you read up on spoon feeding, or by suggesting that… I am spoon feeding? Anyways, you going to post those upgrades (you don’t have to go into any detail, just a general list, you can even pm this to lothy)</p>

<p>Well go ahead and list the “upgrades”</p>

<p>Or maybe the community is so shitty that nobody wants to contribute to it including me. I want you people to think yourself instead of being spoon fed like I did on your NPC AI thread.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh no, your 1 person out of the 7 here. Your comments on the AI thread did not spoon feed in anyway, as nothing you provided I used. As this section is for discussion, I posted it, if I were to post in the help section, then that might be a different story. Anyhow, are you going to list the “few upgrades” that would make rscd comparable? Or do you consider that list a spoon feed.[/quote]<br>
Yes I consider it spoon feeding.</p>
