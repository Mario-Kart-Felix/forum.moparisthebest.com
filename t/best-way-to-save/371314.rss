    <title>Best way to save?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-way-to-save/371314</link>
    <description>So I am currently coming up with some ideas on what would be the best to approach my problem.

Lets just call it a quest.

Player needs to complete 3 objectives. A, B and C 
He must do A first B second and C third in that order.

A simple shit way to do it is to give the player a item that he must use for the next step but I am not looking for that.

So the current idea is to setup a table in the DB which will store players information.

Thoughts or ideas?</description>
