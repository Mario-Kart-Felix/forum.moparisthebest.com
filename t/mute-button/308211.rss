    <title>Mute button?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mute-button/308211</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to make it so that when you click the &quot;yes&quot; emote it allows u to enter a players name and then that player will become muted.  So far i&#39;ve got it where it makes players with rights &lt;=0 do the emote and players &gt;=1 say &quot;this will become the mute button&quot; 

im looking for suggestions on how i can make this pop up something like.... the join chat button and when they hit enter it will make the player get muted. Any help would be awesome thanks!

btw im using 508 tokkulscape source and client</description>
