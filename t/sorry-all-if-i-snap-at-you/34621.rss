    <title>Sorry All If I Snap At You</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sorry-all-if-i-snap-at-you/34621</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;m not looking for sympathy or emotions or something against me. But at the moment I am really annoyed. It all started....

I was playing red-rover with my mates, when this person who I hate tripped me over causing me to loose all the scab I had on my knees. Blood was pissing out. I was about to get up and punch his back teeth out but then all my mates crowded around me when the saw the blood on the courts. Lucky I had all the first-aid in y bad, because I keep that in my bag because when I go riding I take that bag. So I re-bandaged it, put a protective slip over it and everything. Then I went in class and walked passed the kid that did it too me and dropped my elbow into his face. He irrupted and had like an explosion and through crap at me. I picked the rubber up and pelted it at him. I got him in the face. Then the teacher was coming back so we quickly fixed it up. Then this girl who I sit behind said that i was saying crap about him. He throw his notepad at me and it hit me in the eye. I turned around had it in the peg position. About to absolutely pelt it at him. Then I said what the hell? What the hell was that for? Then he said &quot;Oh, &quot;Anonymous&quot; said you were saying crap about me. I turned to her and said What the hell? She said &quot;Oh I&#39;m  so sorry I don&#39;t know why I did it&quot; And I said &quot;Bullshit&quot; and throw it at her, hitting her in the arm. Then she tipped my desk over and honestly, I was about to go mental on her. But then we saw the teacher coming. So I fixed my area up. She told on me and I got in trouble. The teacher said &quot;Is this true and go to the principals office&quot; I explained the story and she said &quot;Ok, well you still did break the rules.&quot; I said &quot;Yes, I&#39;m sorry Mrs&quot; I got excused and was aloud to go get a drink and come back.

Sorry If I snap at you. I&#39;m still very angry.</description>

<p>Who do you hate more, the boy, or the girl. I personally hate the girls thousands upon thousands of times more. It’s whores like that who try to start conflicts, not resolve them. It’s people like that who’s goal in life is to make as many enemies as possible, so long as it gets them some cheap thrill for a few seconds, at the expense of others. These are the ones holding back all of mankind. When karma strikes them, (and believe me, it does, I’ve seen it happen in many forms, some of them ironic, and some of them quite hilarious) pray that it is slow, agonizing, and funny to everyone but the person having to go through it.</p>

              <p>When i was in first grade there was this kid and he was fucking annoying. so i tell the teacher on him and she tells me a story of how she had the same problem in 5th grade but then when she got to 6th grade they became really good friends. so then later we started to become friends(he lives like 2 houses away from me) and we would go to these new appartments and fuck around. I remember we saw this car with a window open (in the garage) and so i just reach from the handle(not from the inside , from the outside) and i open the door and all of a sudden there is this huge fucking alarm and we both run our asses off. but we come back to the car and i forgot to close the door and the alarm already stopped. so we just look through it. he saw a walet. but we only found a dollor in it. oh well. yea funny times. there also these new appartments like across the street from the other ones except these have carpets in their hall ways. So we get on our bikes and ride through cursing as loud as we can. it was so halarious. one time we were just passing through and we would have a soccer ball and he would just randomly kick it as hard as he could and it would hit a door and we would run again. good times. These appartments were like 5 stories high so we’d steal some pumpkins after haloween from people accross the street and drop them. oh yea they built even more appartments at the end of the street and in the garage there there was an elevator. there were probably more then 200 people going on that everyday so we’d ride the elevator to the top and block it. and ride our bikes down. and when we reached to bottom there would be people waiting ask eachother wheres the elevator. and we just tried to keep a straight face.<br>
but he moved away when i was like in 7th grade.</p>
<p>just thought id like to say that.</p>

<p>Huh? Girls don’t usually like it when guys fight.</p>
<p>Yz85, I know how you feel. For some reason everyone in my school tries to pick a fight with me, and i get pretty pissed.</p>
<p>And for a future reference, don’t throw something at, or hit a girl, no matter how mad you are at her. If you do then get ready to get your ass jumped.</p>
