    <title>Webclient Porblems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-porblems/408613</link>
    <description>Well i have made many webclients in the past, but most of these were 562+, now i am currently
working on a project with a Development team and cant seem to make a proper webclient.
Our server is a 474 blank hyperion base, i have followed 317 TuTs and they haven&#39;t worked because
of the difference in coding, i can get everything else myself if someone will just tell me what to edit,
and how to jar it because when i try jarring i will click the finished jar and it will say invalid or corrupt JAR
we release in about a week and i am very tight on time seeing as how i have a whole website to code,
someone please help me out.

Best thanks
