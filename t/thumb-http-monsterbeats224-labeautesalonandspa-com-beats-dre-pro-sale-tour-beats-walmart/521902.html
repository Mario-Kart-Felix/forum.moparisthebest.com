        <p>The CBS News Governmental Unit is checking the latest  campaign commercials. Francesca Gessner discusses ‘Six R’s,’ the newest ad from Hillary Clinton. The Ad: New York Democratic Senate prospect Hillary Clinton has released a fresh TV ad upon education. The 30-second ad titled Six R’s shows Clinton’s commitment to the traditional “Three R’s” * reading, writing math - plus her very own additional three: "responsibility, value and results.In . The ad is actually running statewide in New York.Audio: Announcer: "What in case along with reading, writing and arithmetic, we all added three more R’s: responsibility, respect and results? That’s what Hillary is convinced in - returning to values and also discipline. She’s battling for high standards for students and teachers, far more parental involvement, scaled-down classes, safer colleges, and a $10,000 college tuition tax deduction so a lot more children can pursue their dreams. Who’ll be a strong tone of voice for our children’s education? Hillary. Always has been, often will be."Visual: The advert features various shots of Clinton interacting with parents and children.Fact check: Zero inaccuracies.The Strategy: Six to eight R’s signals a temporary truce from the recent negative advert war between Clinton and also her GOP rival, Congressman Rick Lazio. Together with Six R’s, Clinton’s campaign makes a return to the issues, emphasizing education, an issue specifically appealing to moderate and also swing voters. The ad’s concentrate on “a return to values along with discipline” echoes Republican themes, and suggests Clinton is distancing their self from the traditional Democratic system that tends to steer clear of issues of character and also values in the class. With recent surveys showing Lazio holding a great unusually weak lead in the traditionally Republican upstate area, Clinton is making a serious bid for upstate and suburban voters. Finally, your ad’s tag-line “Always has been, always will be” seeks to advise voters of Clinton’s past be a child advocate as well as reinforce her believability on children’s concerns.  <a href="http://www.prevoir-labelvie.com/michaelkors.com.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">michaelkors.com</a><br>
