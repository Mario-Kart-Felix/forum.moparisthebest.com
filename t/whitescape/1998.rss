    <title>WhiteScape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whitescape/1998</link>
    <description>Most of you probably know i&#39;ve left the community for couple of weeks to decide what i actually wanted to do with WhiteScape, and after many requests of many people i&#39;ve chosen to return.

I arrived back in my forum, and tried to go to my forum with www.whitescape.net, now it seems to be Tasty Noob bought the domain from Kevin (who did leak my sources some time ago !) for a stupid level 100 runescape account... so i have no more domain left, and Kevin is not taking action against Tasty Noob, so there is no other choice then banning both, also XerozCheez is banned from my forum for leaking magic to code Phate.

also Tasty Noob is claiming he made WhiteScape, and just stolen it or something like that, but this is one big lie... like other pople already told: he&#39;s name tells alot about him (mostly the last part)

you cna always reach my development forum at: [url=http://whitefang-wf.no-ip.org/whitescape/forum/index.php]http://whitefang-wf.no-ip.org/whitescape/forum/index.php[/url]

Greets,

<p>Phate = umm well a decent coder. he did make his magic fair and square but he got the frame id from Xero</p>
<p>Me = umm a noob at java (but learning lolol)</p>
<p>thats what i think thats gone on and i think thats how i see lolol</p>

Lol BS I did not leak the magic code dumbass, I told Phate which method was speed, you’re so pissed over the fact that Phate released before you and you needed someone to blame your own mistakes on, in this case it was me. And Tasty Noob leaked your source awhile ago but he never claimed it was yours, and if you banned Kevin for not doing anything about Tasty Noob (I might of misunderstood what you posted there btw) then that’s fucking ridiculous, I dunno why I ever helped you with Whitescape, in fact you had alot of help with graphics from Swift…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Normally when things are told in a development team, those things don’t get out of the team… i told you about the magic stuff, but you did tell it to other people who ARE NOT in the development team, so you LEAKED the code in this case.</p>
<p>Tasty told me on MSN he would claim whitescape as his because he has stolen my domain.<br>
And Kevin is banned because he wouldn’t take back the domain from Tasty, kevin has the domain registered on his name, and he controlls it, so he should take it back and return it to it’s true owner (me), but kevin ain’t doing this, so he’s banned.</p>
<p>And Swift did help me with some things, and he will get his credits for it when WS 3.3 is released… but Swift is a good guy who knows alot, but doesn’t leak it like you.[/quote]</p>
<p>Omfg you didn’t tell me shit about the graphics apart from it was frame 117, I worked out everything else that I knew myself and told Phate what I knew, but he was the one that told me frame 117 was graphics (although I already knew) so I didn’t leak a thing lol, and if I leaked off you then that means you leaked off me.</p>

              <p>Lol BS I did not leak the magic code dumbass, I told Phate which method was speed, you’re so pissed over the fact that Phate released before you and you needed someone to blame your own mistakes on, in this case it was me. And Tasty Noob leaked your source awhile ago but he never claimed it was yours, and if you banned Kevin for not doing anything about Tasty Noob (I might of misunderstood what you posted there btw) then that’s fucking ridiculous, I dunno why I ever helped you with Whitescape, in fact you had alot of help with graphics from Swift…</p>

              <p>Most of you probably know i’ve left the community for couple of weeks to decide what i actually wanted to do with WhiteScape, and after many requests of many people i’ve chosen to return.</p>
<p>I arrived back in my forum, and tried to go to my forum with <a href="http://www.whitescape.net" rel="nofollow noopener">www.whitescape.net</a>, now it seems to be Tasty Noob bought the domain from Kevin (who did leak my sources some time ago !) for a stupid level 100 runescape account… so i have no more domain left, and Kevin is not taking action against Tasty Noob, so there is no other choice then banning both, also XerozCheez is banned from my forum for leaking magic to code Phate.</p>
<p>also Tasty Noob is claiming he made WhiteScape, and just stolen it or something like that, but this is one big lie… like other pople already told: he’s name tells alot about him (mostly the last part)</p>
<p>you cna always reach my development forum at: <a href="http://whitefang-wf.no-ip.org/whitescape/forum/index.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://whitefang-wf.no-ip.org/whitescape/forum/index.php</a></p>
