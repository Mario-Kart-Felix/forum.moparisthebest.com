    <description>ill try to explain this best i can

hi i have been making a webclient for my forums.

i have jarred my client and made it client.jar that works, i can play on the jarred client and downloads my cache. i had uploaded it to dropbox / public and i have used a correct html code but the problem im having is when i go to the webclient it asks me if to run java and i click yes then it just goes white and doesnt load then a little error comes up at the top.

any help please this is [pi] 317


ive followed 3 tutorials in creating the webclient and searched for errors and i cant seem to fix this.
thanks
