    <title>[PI/Any] How to use System.out.println in your favor!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-any-how-to-use-system-out-println-in-your-favor/546279</link>
    <description>Okay. I&#39;m mostly making this because I&#39;m bored.
Yes, anyone with basic understanding of Java should already know, know how to do this. But remember all you Java &quot;guru&#39;s&quot; and &quot;experts&quot; that some people are just starting, and this is a tip that&#39;s best taught sooner rather than later.

[b]Note: In this example I&#39;m using a PI server. You can do this on literally any server, with any code.[/b]

I&#39;m going to bring a user&#39;s post to light, as I can tell he hasn&#39;t exactly gotten far into the Java language. No, I&#39;m not making fun of him, it&#39;s supposed to be a learning experience.
[quote=&quot;levyys, post:1, topic:546267&quot;]When i try to run the server this error shows, [img]http://i.gyazo.com/d77c049245a14892fa704846e89ebb3a.png[/img]
comment if you know whats wrong![/quote]

The answer to his issue is that he edited an item and added an extra tab or space to an item, and the code reading the file doesn&#39;t understand to ignore the extra.
But he already figured that out on his own.
[quote=&quot;levyys, post:2, topic:546267&quot;]i think when i get the error i was changing stats on a couple items or something like that[/quote]

But wait, what if he doesn&#39;t remember what one(s) he edited. If he doesn&#39;t, he could be going through 20k lines of numbers to find the one issue.

Lets not do that, that&#39;s too tedious and not to mention such a waste of time.

Instead, we&#39;re going to make the server print out all the items its reading, that way when it throws that error, you will know the item [u]before[/u] the issue. So all you have to do is find that one, go one line down, and boom. Solved.

In this example, we&#39;re going to be editing the code related to loading the items from the item.cfg. This will be found in ItemHandler.java

Find:
[code=java]
loadItemList(String FileName)[/code]

Under:
[code=java]newItemList(Integer.parseInt(token3[0]), token3[1].replaceAll(&quot;_&quot;, &quot; &quot;), token3[2].replaceAll(&quot;_&quot;, &quot; &quot;), Double.parseDouble(token3[4]), Double.parseDouble(token3[4]), Double.parseDouble(token3[6]), Bonuses);[/code]
Add:
[code=java]
System.out.println(&quot;Item: &quot; + token3[0]);
[/code]

[b]Save &amp; Compile[/b]

Now when you run your server, your console will be flodded with &quot;Item: XXXX&quot;. But when it gets to your error. It&#39;ll look like this:
[IMG]http://puu.sh/baIrF/b2e2d6f267.png[/img]
If I go to item 78 (1 above the last item seen, 77..) I notice:
[code]item = 78	Ice_arrows	Can_only_be_fired_from_yew,_magic,_or_dark_bows.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0[/code]
Oops. It looks like I forgot to add some numbers.

Here&#39;s it fixed:
[code]item = 78	Ice_arrows	Can_only_be_fired_from_yew,_magic,_or_dark_bows.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0[/code]
Now I can go ahead and remove that print line from the code, because my server now fires up without an issue.
[img]http://puu.sh/baIGb/25b6d11bff.png[/img]

All done.

Now you know how to debug the simplest of issues, just by using a feature built into Java (and every other language has it&#39;s own version).</description>

<p>Exactly, this is more of a noobish snippet. (in the 1-3 range) I used the current example I did since PI is still majorly used over other 317 servers. I didn’t want to make a base specific example, though I kind of did. I believe the same item system is in the default delta server.[/quote]</p>
<p>None the less, this kind of debugging skill is useless regardless of experience background (: I have been working with java since i was around 12yo i think. I am 22 now, and still run into those moments where WhyTF doesn’t this work!!?  :mad: is always the first thing i think of. Typically it comes from your mind getting ahead of your fingers.</p>

              <p>Okay. I’m mostly making this because I’m bored.<br>
Yes, anyone with basic understanding of Java should already know, know how to do this. But remember all you Java “guru’s” and “experts” that some people are just starting, and this is a tip that’s best taught sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note: In this example I’m using a PI server. You can do this on literally any server, with any code.</span></p>
<p>I’m going to bring a user’s post to light, as I can tell he hasn’t exactly gotten far into the Java language. No, I’m not making fun of him, it’s supposed to be a learning experience.</p>
<p>[quote=“levyys, post:1, topic:546267”]When i try to run the server this error shows, <img src="http://i.gyazo.com/d77c049245a14892fa704846e89ebb3a.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
comment if you know whats wrong![/quote]</p>
<p>The answer to his issue is that he edited an item and added an extra tab or space to an item, and the code reading the file doesn’t understand to ignore the extra.<br>
But he already figured that out on his own.</p>

</div>
<blockquote>
<p>i think when i get the error i was changing stats on a couple items or something like that</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But wait, what if he doesn’t remember what one(s) he edited. If he doesn’t, he could be going through 20k lines of numbers to find the one issue.</p>
<p>Lets not do that, that’s too tedious and not to mention such a waste of time.</p>
<p>Instead, we’re going to make the server print out all the items its reading, that way when it throws that error, you will know the item <span class="bbcode-u">before</span> the issue. So all you have to do is find that one, go one line down, and boom. Solved.</p>
<p>In this example, we’re going to be editing the code related to loading the items from the item.cfg. This will be found in ItemHandler.java</p>
<p>Find:</p>
<p><code>
loadItemList(String FileName)</code></p>
<p>Under:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Add:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">System.out.println("Item: " + token3[0]);</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Save &amp; Compile</span></p>
<p>Now when you run your server, your console will be flodded with “Item: XXXX”. But when it gets to your error. It’ll look like this:<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/baIrF/b2e2d6f267.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
If I go to item 78 (1 above the last item seen, 77…) I notice:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Oops. It looks like I forgot to add some numbers.</p>
<p>Here’s it fixed:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Now I can go ahead and remove that print line from the code, because my server now fires up without an issue.<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/baIGb/25b6d11bff.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>All done.</p>
<p>Now you know how to debug the simplest of issues, just by using a feature built into Java (and every other language has it’s own version).</p>
