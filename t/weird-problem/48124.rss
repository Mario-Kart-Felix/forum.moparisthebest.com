    <title>Weird Problem!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weird-problem/48124</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having a problem with the server I always use. The IP is highscape.tar.cc and it&#39;s supposed to be up for 15 minutes and go down for 2 minutes. Anyway, when I try to log on, it logs me right back out. Is it possible I could be banned? The owner never told me I was banned and I don&#39;t remember doing anything wrong. Someone please help!</description>
