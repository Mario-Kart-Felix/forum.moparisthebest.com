    <description>Ok so this person wrote me a messege saying how to create a server and need help, etc. Here Is My Messege and i hope it helps all those people that need help.. Ok:

              HiS Question: 

Yo R2j3cktz ive been seen your postings around and i needed some help no one has ever like completley told me how to work sources &amp; clients and how i make my own and all that ive got the variables,java,no-ip account and postfoworeded and ive had no luck :/.hopefully you can help?Thanks man :]

         He Spelled My Name Wrong, Grr :D








                  My Answer:


 Totally, So, First, For Enviromental Vertebraes Go To Control Panel, Find &quot;System&quot; And Open that up, look on &quot;Advanced&quot; then at the bottom left hand, you&#39;ll see Enviromental Variables. Click On That, at the topish , look for &quot;new&quot; then in that put in CLASSPATH then Copy &amp; Paste This is In: CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin;%CLASSPATH%;
But When you see jdk1.6.0_11 put in your java , if it was 17 you&#39;d put it in as, jdk1.6.0_17 , and so on. Put that in both of the system things, top and bottom. Then, On &quot;System Variables&quot; Scroll down until you find &quot;Path&quot;, From there click on it and click edit at the bottom. In that box erase the variable value and put in this: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin;
Then change your Java again like classpath to yours.
Now, your done with enviromental vertebraes.

For Java, I Use Jdk6u14-Jdk6u16- &amp; Jdk6u17. Thats What I Recommend.

 For No-Ip, Just Sign up/Log In. Click &quot; Add A Host &quot; The 4th Box Out Of 5. For your hostname, make it your host name. For Example: sunnydeescape.no-ip.biz or whatever. Now Click &quot;Create Host&quot;. Now go to the main page on no-ip.com~
Find &quot;DownLoads&quot;. Then Select your opterating System, 3 Choices. Mine Is Windows. Click it again, then again, until you can download No-ip. Duc. Dl it then log in with your no-ip.com account user &amp; pass (not ur msn pass). When you see a box then your server name beside it. Click it until it is blushing -2 red circles on the face- that means others can connect.

Now your done with that.

For Portforwarding Go to &quot;Run&quot; at the start button, then Type in &quot;CMD&quot; in the box. Which stands for command promt(i think) on the black box put in where its blinking &quot;ipconfig&quot; when it loads find your default gateway. Write it down or whatever and type it in your browser/Internet Bar. your router will pop up, it might have a pass thing on it, just put in &quot;admin&quot; for the pass. Now from here i really dont know because it depends on what kind a router..Mines Bell Sympatico and its easy. I go to home Networking - then add the thing as RSPS port 43594 and then TCP. So Watch some videos for help or just try to find it yourself. Srry :(

Now For Firewall, Go to control panel, find/click on Windows Firewall or whatever.  click the off button (circle) even tho its not recommended it allows other to connect to your internet to join your server. Once you&#39;ve done that.go to Exceptions and Click &quot;Add Port...&quot; Put the Name As: RSPS, for the port number put: 43594 or whatever u set it too. then Click TCP for the last step. then click ok, ok , so on.

Once you&#39;ve downloaded your source extract it. If you cant compile or it wont allow you. Right Click It And Click &quot;edit&quot; then once you&#39;ve done that change the jdk1.6.0_(number) to your java. but i recommend jdk1.6.0_14.
Then run your server , And Gl :D But make sure, your no-ip.duc is on the blush face. b4 you run it. Then have fun.


For Clients, Idk really know how But i think its Like EUI orr something. or close to it. if you find it click edit. then change all the ips to your thing. Oh and i have no clue how to make a client..i just LEECH clients &gt;.&gt; Sorry but i only leech it for me...And Yah, So thats how Lolz. It may look long with all the writing but its easy when ur actually doing it... If i made a problem or something tell me or post/messege me.

              My Answer:
</code></pre>
<p>Totally, So, First, For Enviromental Vertebraes Go To Control Panel, Find “System” And Open that up, look on “Advanced” then at the bottom left hand, you’ll see Enviromental Variables. Click On That, at the topish , look for “new” then in that put in CLASSPATH then Copy &amp; Paste This is In: CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin;%CLASSPATH%;<br>
But When you see jdk1.6.0_11 put in your java , if it was 17 you’d put it in as, jdk1.6.0_17 , and so on. Put that in both of the system things, top and bottom. Then, On “System Variables” Scroll down until you find “Path”, From there click on it and click edit at the bottom. In that box erase the variable value and put in this: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin;<br>
Then change your Java again like classpath to yours.<br>
Now, your done with enviromental vertebraes.</p>
<p>For Java, I Use Jdk6u14-Jdk6u16- &amp; Jdk6u17. Thats What I Recommend.</p>
<p>For No-Ip, Just Sign up/Log In. Click " Add A Host " The 4th Box Out Of 5. For your hostname, make it your host name. For Example: sunnydeescape.no-ip.biz or whatever. Now Click “Create Host”. Now go to the main page on no-ip.com~<br>
Find “DownLoads”. Then Select your opterating System, 3 Choices. Mine Is Windows. Click it again, then again, until you can download No-ip. Duc. Dl it then log in with your <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> account user &amp; pass (not ur msn pass). When you see a box then your server name beside it. Click it until it is blushing -2 red circles on the face- that means others can connect.</p>
<p>Now your done with that.</p>
<p>For Portforwarding Go to “Run” at the start button, then Type in “CMD” in the box. Which stands for command promt(i think) on the black box put in where its blinking “ipconfig” when it loads find your default gateway. Write it down or whatever and type it in your browser/Internet Bar. your router will pop up, it might have a pass thing on it, just put in “admin” for the pass. Now from here i really dont know because it depends on what kind a router…Mines Bell Sympatico and its easy. I go to home Networking - then add the thing as RSPS port 43594 and then TCP. So Watch some videos for help or just try to find it yourself. Srry <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Now For Firewall, Go to control panel, find/click on Windows Firewall or whatever.  click the off button (circle) even tho its not recommended it allows other to connect to your internet to join your server. Once you’ve done that.go to Exceptions and Click “Add Port…” Put the Name As: RSPS, for the port number put: 43594 or whatever u set it too. then Click TCP for the last step. then click ok, ok , so on.</p>
<p>Once you’ve downloaded your source extract it. If you cant compile or it wont allow you. Right Click It And Click “edit” then once you’ve done that change the jdk1.6.0_(number) to your java. but i recommend jdk1.6.0_14.<br>
