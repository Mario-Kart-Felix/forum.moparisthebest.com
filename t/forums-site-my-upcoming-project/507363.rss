    <description>I&#39;m planning a new project.

It&#39;s going to be a community for RSPS, much like moparscape, but it&#39;s going to be a bit different.

My primary goal is to help people start coding. Firstly, I&#39;ll perfect and re-write a PI base for the community to revolve around. (Kind of like silabscape and moparscape has done..) But what I&#39;ll do is leave it almost completely blank, but with all of the skills and basic minigames added. I&#39;m going to make sure it&#39;s properly formatted and netbeans compatible(so that the right coding ethics are taught) I will add tons of tutorials on adding big features and stuff to this base, but I won&#39;t do it all for them. This way it gives them a good base to start from that has all the basic skills(all skills except for the newest ones, dung summon constr, etc...), all of the basic minigames, no bugs, great methods, cleaned up really well, organized, etc. I won&#39;t add a bunch of npcs everywhere, I wont add a bunch of shops, I&#39;ll leave that to the coder to do, that way the hundreds of leeched rs servers will die out a bit. This will make them have to learn to code in order to host a rsps, but make it so that they don&#39;t have a load of trouble getting started. This is the exact opposite of what it is now. It takes forever to get started unless you sit there for hours trying to find out how to make a rsps, then you have to learn to portforward, then u have to learn to code, and most beginners cant just jump right into this.

I will also make plenty of html, php, css, and js tutorials. This way people stretch their coding abilities to more than just RSPS/java. Most people start with RSPS around age 12-16, so by doing this, I&#39;m going to help tons of people advance their computer knowledge. If you can code html, css, and php alone, you can go reallyyy far because you can get a nice high paying job in no time if you&#39;re a pro. If you can also code java and c++, you&#39;ll end up rich xD. I know that if I would&#39;ve never started RSPS, I would know nothing about computers, and my future would be a lot more limited. My biggest skill is technology. And where did that start? RSPS.

My other goal is to stop RSPS from dying out..Because yes, it&#39;s happening. I remember when u could start a server, even a crap one, and 2 days later 10+ players, now it takes weeks to establish a steady 10+ players...

It will include a toplist, a base that the community revolves around, a forums, many tutorials, etc.

If you have any suggestions or ideas, please tell me. I can code so I won&#39;t need much help with that but I would like someone to help me with images. I have not come up with a name/date for this project but it will be done in about a year. Whoever wants to jump aboard, you wont regret it. Thanks for reading this post! (:</description>

              <p>Yeah, Good luck and stuff you have some good ideas! I would just like to point out you saying that “RSPS are dying out”… this is not true, they are only expanding more and more, the reason why its harder to get 10+ players is because there are so many more servers now a days. At least that’s what I think, I’ve been gone for a while.</p>
