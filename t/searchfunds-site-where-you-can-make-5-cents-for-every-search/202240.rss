    <description>Hey guys, I found this sweet website that pays you 5 cents every time you search
 
-

It just replaces your default search with ask.com/yahoo.com/msn.com and soon google.com

I’ve checked different sites and people have been paid! People also have been warned for using it too much so don’t spam and try to use it for real searches.  
 
Just check it out!  It’s free and takes less then 5 minutes to sign up.  

Plus for all your referrals you will earn for
1st level referrals, they make you 10% of what they earn 
2nd level 5%
3rd level 2.5%

So more referrals the better!

I have been searching through other forums and have found proof of payment!!!

The last one was an earlier payment so I believe they’re min payment was less then.

Any questions just post and I will get back to you as soon as I can!  :)
