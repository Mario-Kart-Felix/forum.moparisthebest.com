    <title>How to increase damage? 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-increase-damage-317/423820</link>
    <description>Alright ive been browing through forums for a few days now and I see ways to increase the damage for lets say Dragon claws, or anything really and ive seen its in the client.java but with searching and searching I have found nothing in where i could change with the attack damage and the spec damage. So if you could direct me to a post where it was said, or just quickly explain it on how to do it would be great! 

Thanks</description>

if (c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon] == 15027) {<br>
maxHit *= 2.00;<br>
}<br>
thats in combat assistant, that increases maxhit by double, (this is for pi btw)</p>
