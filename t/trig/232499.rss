    <description>Well when school started this year, I had originally planned to take Precalculus Honors at my school. It was too difficult for me since I only had math in 10th grade for only a semester because of the way my former school&#39;s block schedule was planned out. So I switched into trigonometry honors and it&#39;s still like a different language to me. The only other class I can switch into is Integrated Mathwhich is a step above Algebra2, so should I switch into it?</description>

              <p>If you switch into it. It will be fairly easy. I’m taking pre-calculus and i’m a freshman. If its to hard you should switch out</p>
