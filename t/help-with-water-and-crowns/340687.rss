    <title>Help with water and crowns</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-water-and-crowns/340687</link>
    <description>ok so all the water in my server is lava even the fountains i replaced the cache with a couple others but it didnt work. Some1 told me to use toms cache suite(which i have) to change it. the only problem is that i dont know wat to do once i load the cache in tomes cache suite. if some1 one could tell me how to fix this or tell me how to use toms cache suite that would be great.
Another problem i am having is adding the crowns to the game. i can make them and get them into toms cache suite but i dont know how to make them appear next to peoples name. i want to add a doner crown which it is not a player right it has its own thing. i would also like to add a owner crown which is player rights 3 for me. i have also looked at some guides other people post but for some reason they do not work for me.
any help is appreciated
by the way i am running a 317 delta if that helps</description>

              <p>For the lava/water problem:<br>
Open: Class30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub3.java<br>
You should search for something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (i == 1) { i = 40</code></pre>
<p>(It may not be exactly the same)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (i == 1) { i = 40</code></pre>
<p>This just changes texture 1 (water) to texture 40 (lava)</p>
<p>Textures:</p>
<p><code>	 *	50	suggests the end of the textures...
	 *	49	=	Something to do with 48, I assume
	 *	48	=	Hyroglyphs?
	 *	47	=	Extremely light wall colour...
	 *	46	=	Ground in varrock by the fountain
	 *	45	=	Door
	 *	44	=	Similar to 43; Darker
	 *	43	=	Buildings' stone wall
	 *	42	=	Sold blue, for those flowers in Varrock I believe
	 *	41	=	Bushes of some sort
	 *	40	=	lava	
	 *	39	=	Painting of an elf
	 *	38	=	One of the new Falador textures
	 *	37	=	Same as 38	
	 *	36	=	Door or floor texture?
	 *	35	=	New Falador walls
	 *	34	=	Magic tree stars	
	 *	33	=	Maple tree leaves
	 *	32	=	Sand maybe?
	 *	31	=	Another lava overlay
	 *	30	=	Yew tree overlays
	 *	29	=	Sort of like fern leaves :\
	 *	28	=	???????????????????????
	 *	27	=	Snake skin
	 *	26	=	Spider webs
	 *	25	=	Water of some sort, I think	
	 *	24	=	Flowing water	
	 *	23	=	Dark buidling siding (something near Lumbridge I think?)
	 *	22	=	Wooden floor
	 *	21	=	Roofing maybe?
	 *	20	=	Book case
	 *	19	=	Something with.. holes..
	 *	18	=	Sand..or..something?
	 *	17	=	Water found water
	 *	16	=	Wooden roof I think.
	 *	15	=	Looks like an overlay for water?
	 *	14	=	Portrait of a king
	 *	13	=	Landscape of mountains	
	 *	12	=	Bars on those jail doors, etc
	 *	11	=	Runecrafting altar \ mysterious rune texture
