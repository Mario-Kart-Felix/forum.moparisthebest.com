    <description>14 Year old Teen Questioned for Online Bush Threats
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061014/ap_on_hi_te/myspace_bush_threat

&lt;blockquote&gt;SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Upset by the war in
Iraq, Julia Wilson vented her frustrations with
President Bush last spring on her Web page on MySpace.com. She posted a picture of the president, scrawled &quot;Kill Bush&quot; across the top and drew a dagger stabbing his outstretched hand. She later replaced her page on the social-networking site after learning in her eighth-grade history class that such threats are a federal offense.

It was too late.

Federal authorities had found the page and placed Wilson on their checklist. They finally reached her this week in her molecular biology class.

The 14-year-old freshman was taken out of class Wednesday and questioned for about 15 minutes by two
Secret Service agents. The incident has upset her parents, who said the agents should have included them when they questioned their daughter.

On Friday, the teenager said the agents&#39; questioning led her to tears.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t dangerous. I mean, look at what&#39;s (stenciled) on my backpack — it&#39;s a heart. I&#39;m a very peace-loving person,&quot; said Wilson, an honor student who describes herself as politically passionate. &quot;I&#39;m against the war in Iraq. I&#39;m not going to kill the president.&quot;

Her mother, Kirstie Wilson, said two agents showed up at the family&#39;s home Wednesday afternoon, questioned her and promised to return once her daughter was home from school.

After they left, Kirstie Wilson sent a text message to her daughter&#39;s cell phone, telling her to come straight home: &quot;There are two men from the secret service that want to talk with you. Apparently you made some death threats against president bush.&quot;

&quot;Are you serious!?!? omg. Am I in a lot of trouble?&quot; her daughter responded.

Moments later, Kirstie Wilson received another text message from her daughter saying agents had pulled her out of class.

Julia Wilson said the agents threatened her by saying she could be sent to juvenile hall for making the threat.

&quot;They yelled at me a lot,&quot; she said. &quot;They were unnecessarily mean.&quot;

Spokesmen for the Secret Service in Sacramento and Washington, D.C., said they could not comment on the case.

Wilson and her parents said the agents were justified in questioning her over her MySpace.com posting. But they said they believe agents went too far by not waiting until she was out of school.

They also said the agents should have more quickly figured out they weren&#39;t dealing with a real danger. Ultimately, the agents told the teen they would delete her investigation file.

Assistant Principal Paul Belluomini said the agents gave him the impression the girl&#39;s mother knew they were planning to question her daughter at school. There is no legal requirement that parents be notified.

&quot;This has been an ongoing problem,&quot; said Ann Brick, an attorney with the
American Civil Liberties Union in San Francisco.

Former Govs. Pete Wilson and
Gray Davis vetoed bills that would have required that parents give consent or be present when their children are questioned at school by law enforcement officers. A similar bill this year cleared the state Senate but died in the Assembly.

Julia Wilson plans to post a new MySpace.com page, this one devoted to organizing other students to protest the Iraq war.

&quot;I decided today I think I will because it (the questioning) went too far,&quot; she said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

lol that&#39;s funny. She made Bush threats on her MySpace and feds questioned. 

&quot;Are you serious!?!? omg. Am I in a lot of trouble?&quot; her daughter responded.

Omg like omg! She sounds so threatening.</description>

<p>Ambushed literally, I got accepted into this specialized high school for gifted kids and I got my acceptance letter a week after the school started so joined and had to catch up on so much fucking homework its not even funny. And to make things worse I live on one end of NYC and my HS is at the other end all the way in Manhattan…JOLLY GOOD! :rolleyes: Anyway now the workload settled so I might be coming on a little more often.</p>
<p>Anyways how are things lately, Anything big going on? I heard Mopar is being Dos’d by the Palefaced Dick…</p>

I go to a selective school too, although probably different to yours. By gifted do you mean like a Maths school, or something? Mines Performing Arts (Drama, Singing, Dancing, Music). &lt;3</p>
<p>Yeh, Mopar’s being Ddos’d by RaW. But i think he has it under control now. Good ol’ Mopar. It’s good to see you partially back (Not sure if you’re staying for long?).[/quote]</p>
<p>Yea mine is called Stuyvesant, its an allround good school.</p>
<p>I’ll always stay, I just won’t make my presence widely known, I really don’t have time to go through every section, I’ll prolly zip through General Discussion, Debates, Site discussion community Section etc.</p>

I go to a selective school too, although probably different to yours. By gifted do you mean like a Maths school, or something? Mines Performing Arts (Drama, Singing, Dancing, Music). &lt;3</p>
<p>Yeh, Mopar’s being Ddos’d by RaW. But i think he has it under control now. Good ol’ Mopar. It’s good to see you partially back (Not sure if you’re staying for long?).</p>
