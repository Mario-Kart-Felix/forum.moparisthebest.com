    <description>Well as some of you will have seen i have posted a modified ROM in this board and it is GBA, i want to branch out into NDS roms which is no problem to do its just the actual emulator that is a problem. No one has succesfully made a good working NDS emulator they always have errors and major lag issues. I challenge some of the best and brightest people of MITB to make a working NDS emu. If you do decide to do keep things in mind: no NDS emu so far has a frame throttle which gba emus do. No NDS emu has the music working correctly it sort of comes out in a mish mash of the music. Also the emus have problems running the 3d graphics which causes glitches and such.</description>

Lol solve world hunger <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> i think its different to PSP because like i said there are attempts to make a good emu but the bugs are all in the way and the music and the lack of a throttle make them not very good :S</p>

              <p>I’d be interested in writing one, but I have very limited experience with virtualization and emulation. First off, I don’t even own a DS, nor know anything about the hardware (specifically the CPU). If it’s anything like how the PSP works, there’d be a hell of a lot of stuff to reimplement and reverse engineer.</p>
