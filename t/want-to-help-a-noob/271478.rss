Hi, I run an online gaming community, we currently have half-life2 &amp; tibia servers, but we just expanded the ram on our box and wanting to upgrade to a nice Prive-RS Server, so with that said, im rather new to this.. i spent most of yesterday looking for a good &quot;private&quot; build.. that has most of the functions that the real RuneScape has (castle wars/banks/trade/Pest control/ ect ect.. the full game) this seems to be the best? 

A.) does anyone know of one with more then this has to offer? im noticing a few people posting about some bugs.
B.) can anyone explain to me how to get the client to work? in my java-editor i went into client.java and changed the IP to our host IP, but then i hit the compile icon (in the folder).. and am i missing something? no client.. im sure its just because im new... im missing something here?

The Server Im Looking At:

if anyone wants to post a better working server that i didnt see, be my guest.. or if someone can atleast explain the client compiler.

thanks,
