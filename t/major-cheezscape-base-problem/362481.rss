    <description>ok, well i am currently using the cheezscape base. i have configured my shops perfectly right i am 100% sure there is nothing wrong in the shops.cfg and the client.java files dealing with the shops. but atm i can not sell anything to them. i mean nothing not even anything that is being sold in the shops. i have absoultly no idea why but i suspect that it is lacking a file that controls the shop sales.</description>
