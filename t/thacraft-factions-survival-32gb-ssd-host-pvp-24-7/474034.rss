[center][size=14pt]ThaCraft - Factions &amp; Survival[/size]


Our Minecraft was mainly based on Survival / Factions. We slowly moved the server towards becoming a unique RPG server which has become a success without using an economy system which most servers tend to use. Our economy is using Emerald to buy items from villagers. To get Emeralds you must convert 1 Diamond to 3 Emerald via the Bank at our main city which you can get to using the portal under spawn.
