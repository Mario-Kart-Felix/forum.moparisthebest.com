    <description>As its Christmas eve I am doing a free 10th lobby for xbox 360 cod WaW 

This is 100% safe and completely legit. 

If you would like a invite please send Zycel a message on xbox live it must say &quot;Mopar 10th&quot; and you may get a invite. 

Please check the status of the lobbys and I will kepp you updated.
