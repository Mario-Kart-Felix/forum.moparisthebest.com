    <title>Memory Card MicroSD problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/memory-card-microsd-problems/275283</link>
    <description>I bought one of these a few months ago for my phone. It&#39;s an 8gb MicroSDHD card, and was working fine up until today. I opened my phone on the PC and it said the &quot;memory card information was not found&quot; or something along those lines. So I try to open up a file from the memory card through my phone, but &quot;file does not exist&quot;. I take out the card and insert it again and get a message on my phone saying &quot;format unrecognizable - would you like to format the card now?&quot;. I go Yes but it just returns &quot;ERROR!&quot;, and that&#39;s it.

I plug it in to my computer through the phone and the memory card isn&#39;t even there. 

Any ideas? My phone is a samsung tocco. I will try it on my sisters phone when she is back and see what happens...</description>

              <p>That, or your phone specifically accepts microSD. Anything 4GB+ goes into SDHC territory. Some things don’t like that unless it specifically says so.</p>

<p>Thats your Problem!</p>
<p>I have a samsung and sometimes randomly my 1GB MicroSD card will say that it cannot find the ./root directory. I just took out the Card from the phone and waited about 10 minutes put it back in and it miraculously works!</p>
