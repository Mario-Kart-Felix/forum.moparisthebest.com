I was homeschooled for 2 months but decided on going back to school, i am so glad i went back to school.

Are all home schooled kids like him?

Oh also from the comments on this video (i couldnt have said it better myself):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dden5 | Posted at 08:30am Jul, 12 2007
THIS is exactly what homeschooling CAN do to
a kid... make him into a mindless learner
that has no life... Im not saying that all
homeschoolers are like this, but jesus, this
is a classic case of the kid who&#39;s never
going to get laid and turning into the 40
year old virgin. Here he is fucking telling
a HOT CNN reporter that she said his name
wrong, how he likes Subway tuna sandwiches
and how him and his MOM aren&#39;t surprised
that he won a spelling bee. If you ask me,
this kid hasn&#39;t been taught any life skills
whatsoever, and although he might end up
making serious cash, he probably has no
friends and no real fun. four words can
summarize what I&#39;ve just said... THIS KID IS
SAD&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
