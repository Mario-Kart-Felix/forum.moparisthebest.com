    <title>Thoughts and comments?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thoughts-and-comments/507711</link>
    <description>I found a template that I liked and change the colors and little things about it and wanted some feedback. 

It&#39;s for my boss&#39;s business so keep that in mind. Negative/positive feedback is appreciated.
From the humans eye I really haven&#39;t done a lot and I&#39;ve ran out of ideas on how to make it look better or how to make it more interactive so anything you have to say on that topic would be appreciated as well. Thanks.

Decided to try and piece things together again so I am starting over but with the same design.

I don’t like how the layout is…<br>
The top row of stuff has 4 items, and they’re smaller. Then the second row has 2 items, and they’re twice as big.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Right now my mind is going crazy trying to figure out how I went to display things so until I can figure that out or someone maybe throws me in  the right direction it’s gonna look crappy :p[/quote]<br>
Right now it’s a lot better <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
But you should have it like this:<br>
[image][main text]<br>
[content]<br>
In those 4 boxes.</p>
<p>Or at least center the white text in the tops of them <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Edit:<br>
You should also look into changing the color of those strokes in the logo… It’s funky looking having those being blue, when the site theme is more grey/black and white.</p>

The top rectangle, where the Contact Us and company name is located, I feel could be a bit smaller.<br>
The Weather Report widget seems sort of useless in my opinion, unless you are running a local news site.<br>
The “Who are you representing” and “Do you remember…?” boxes could be moved to a separate page listing regular products, with your promotional products being those that are on sale, new releases, etc.<br>
More emphasis should be put on the News column, as this should be one of the very first things a site visitor should see.[/quote]</p>
<p>wow, thanks!<br>
Ill move things around and see what I can come up with. Thanks again for the feedback.</p>

              <p>I’ve never been a fan of big pictures in slideshows. Do it proportionally, but size the picture down by a scale of, say, 20%.<br>
The top rectangle, where the Contact Us and company name is located, I feel could be a bit smaller.<br>
The Weather Report widget seems sort of useless in my opinion, unless you are running a local news site.<br>
The “Who are you representing” and “Do you remember…?” boxes could be moved to a separate page listing regular products, with your promotional products being those that are on sale, new releases, etc.<br>
More emphasis should be put on the News column, as this should be one of the very first things a site visitor should see.</p>

Either way, this looks nice so far. A little cluttered so far in my opinion, but nice nonetheless.[/quote]<br>

              <p>I found a template that I liked and change the colors and little things about it and wanted some feedback.</p>
<p>It’s for my boss’s business so keep that in mind. Negative/positive feedback is appreciated.<br>
From the humans eye I really haven’t done a lot and I’ve ran out of ideas on how to make it look better or how to make it more interactive so anything you have to say on that topic would be appreciated as well. Thanks.</p>
