    <description>hey guys brand new to this place and am a little confused as to what I need to do.

When i try to play one of the &#39;scapes&#39; I can&#39;t play any of them. The main one I am looking to play is ALLStarLegends-Oldschool.

I have a macbook pro and Java and i can&#39;t load anything via web client which i am trying to do!!

It then tells me to download which i am afraid of because I do not wait to download a virus on my mac and whatnot. Also, it is a process to enable the computer to download thins not from mac.

Also, when i try to fix it to be able to play via web client, it says to change security settings to medium which i don&#39;t have, so i put the client http: address in the EXCEPTION list and it still doesn&#39;t run?!?!?!

Some one please help me !

Thanks.</description>

              <p>He’s talking about the later mac os versions not allowing unsigned software by default. If it’s a jar and can run by double clicking, you can right click and click open, instead of double clicking, and this will bypass this restriction for just this jar. If it’s not, you will have to enable unsigned software.</p>

<p>Download the client and run it using the Terminal. that should hopefully print any errors that show up - tell those errors to the owner of the server you want to play.<br>
They need to fix it, not us here on mopar (sorry).</p>
