    <title>Strong VPS with Modsecurity/firewall rules</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/strong-vps-with-modsecurity-firewall-rules/485385</link>
    <description>So, my server has been attacked several times since our launch. Today we got kicked off our second VPS. We are not welcome back due to heavy DDoS. We use burst.net for our site, so our site rarely goes down. We purchased one for one of our worlds and it had a lot of &#39;hick-ups&#39;. Which was a huge inconvenience to our players. Any recommended VPS companies? We have roughly $100 to spend per month. If it can run both site/server it would be nice. But we need something that can withstand a DDoS attack, and we&#39;ve learned a little bit of modsecurity and firewall, so if we can find one that allows us to mess with that it would be perfect.</description>

<p>Firewalls won’t help against DDoS. DDoS works by clogging up your ports, before they ever even reach your software firewall. Can’t give you any VPS recommendation though as all my servers are on dedis.</p>

<p>We’ll even buy a dedicated. Which one do you use?</p>
