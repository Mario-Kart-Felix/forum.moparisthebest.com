    <description>Ok. This one is a question for someone with experience in IO java coding. 

508 Source - DavidScape 

Problem:       Peoples accounts get reset, so these commands: ( ::savebackup and ::loadbackup ) are used to save a backup and then load it again. It was coded by Bulby, and works. However, people figured out ways to dupe items using it. So I removed the item part of loadbackup. It works and no duping. However, now people complain about losing there items, which is understood. So I needed to find a way to load the backup without doing either of those, allow duping or lose items. I figured it out. Instead of it reading the backup and updating the player, it could log the player out then COPY the entire file over, instead of just reading it. So I added this void: [code=java]
public static void copyfile(String srFile, String dtFile){
    try{
      File f1 = new File(srFile);
      File f2 = new File(dtFile);
      InputStream in = new FileInputStream(f1);
      OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(f2);
      byte[] buf = new byte[1024];
      int len;
      while ((len = in.read(buf)) &gt; 0){
        out.write(buf, 0, len);
      }
      in.close();
      out.close();
      System.out.println(&quot;Loaded Backup.&quot;);
    }
    catch(FileNotFoundException ex){
      System.exit(0);
    }
    catch(IOException e){
      System.out.println(e.getMessage());      
    }
  }
[/code]
The in my commands section:

For loadbackup command: [code=java]
String temp1 = p.username;
 if (p != null) {
p.frames.logout(p);
}
Misc.copyfile(&quot;./data/characters/backup/&quot; + temp1 +&quot;.dat&quot;, &quot;./data/characters/mainsave/&quot; + temp1 +&quot;.dat&quot;);
}
[/code] 
The reason It saves their username is because their PlayerID becomes null when they log out. I log them out so that the player doesnt overwrite his backup by staying logged in(normally it saves every 10 sec, so unless they log out it would overwrite the backup.) So can anyone see anything wrong with this?  Please only post if you have a helpful comment.</description>
