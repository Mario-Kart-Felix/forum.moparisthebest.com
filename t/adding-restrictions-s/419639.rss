    <title>Adding restrictions :S</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-restrictions-s/419639</link>
    <description>So, i have a few items that i want to add restrictions on, so only people with playerRights, or donator status&#39;s can wear them.

Eg, a prayer cape. (i know its stupid, but just for example)

A normal player tries to put it on,
It won&#39;t equip, and sends a message;
Then get a message (&quot;Only Donators can wear this cape!&quot;)

Etc etc, how will i do that?
Cause i&#39;ve got a few items in mind, that i want only donators and admins/mods to be able to equip/wear :) 

Please help! :)</description>
