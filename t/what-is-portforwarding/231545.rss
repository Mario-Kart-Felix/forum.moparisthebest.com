    <title>What is portforwarding?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-portforwarding/231545</link>
    <description> :confused: I have no clue what it means, but someone said i had to portforwardd my files to get his server to work (but would not bother explaining what that ment). Would someone explain to me what exacly that means?

I have been trying to get moparscape to work for two days without success. The site has no tutorials which i could find that explained how to use the game. Furthermore, i cannot find any who either knows how or will bother telling me how to get moparscape working. Would someone mind helping me out by answering my question? :D</description>
