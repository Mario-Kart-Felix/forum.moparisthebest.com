[center][size=12pt][b]What Is Terminology Going To Be About?[/size][/center]

[b]Well terminology is a 483 looking server using emulous base i&#39;m trying to recreate as much as i can of runescape but I&#39;ll need help so this is why i am asking all you fellow moparscapians ive done quite a bit recreating some combat and skills also fixing bugs I&#39;m trying to achieve what no moparscapian has done kill delta,jonnys attempt was very good but sadly it was messed up but now I&#39;m going to try for jonnys sake and the sake of rsps I&#39;m tired of (coolscape - delta -) , (ownagescape - delta-) i hope you get the idea it&#39;s making this community very lazy and all servers now suck and are very predictable it was great in old fashion times when there was cheezescape and stuff they where great servers now they have died and delta has ended up being a leeched server and full of shit.So will you moparscapians dare to challenge the most leeched server in all rsps history? if you are ready for the challenge you will need to fill a application, The application is for good coders and who can proof them selves worthy of taking on one of the biggest challenges in rsps history. Yes i knbow this fucking sounds stupid but at least let&#39;s try.Hopefully this project will inspire other people to code and people to stop leeching delta and actual code.[/b]
