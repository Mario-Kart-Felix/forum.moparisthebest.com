    <title>What came first?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-came-first/8452</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sure many of you have heard this question before, but what came first? The chicken? Or the egg? Well, the question is pretty simple, due to the fact that chicken wasn&#39;t even a creature yet in that time so to be absolutley 100% correct, i have come up with an answer.

A pegion fucked a dove. Thus making a chicken. The tastefull meal that we eat today.[br][size=1]Posted at: August 07, 2006, 04:13:01 PM[/size][hr]But why can&#39;t the chicken fly? And why does it have that hangling doodle thing on its face? The answer is obviouse. 

It had cancer, thus when the chicken fucked another pegion giving that female baby chicken cancer also. 

So why are eggs good for you? But why does cancer kill humans? And creatures? That&#39;s because the chicken is an alien. Spys from russia maybe. Planning on destorying us all.</description>
