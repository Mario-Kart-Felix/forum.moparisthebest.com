    <title>Getting Models</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-models/449453</link>
    <description>Does anyone know how I can find models of items in a 317 PI server? I can get the custom items I have added to my server in itemdef.java but for example I want the models of bandos and a fury? Anyone know of a program that I can use to find these? or a link to a list or something? I&#39;ve searched google and have found nothing.
Thanks for the help people.</description>
