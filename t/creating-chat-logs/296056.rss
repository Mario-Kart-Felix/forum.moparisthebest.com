    <description>Hello everyone. I&#39;m the owner of a private server [obviously?], and I&#39;d like to know if anyone can help me out as to making chat logs. I&#39;d like it so every command, and everything that is typed, goes into a txt file, or something.. I&#39;m tired of logging in my server and hearing.. &quot;FURY FURY!?@@!? UR MODS ARE ABUSING?@!!!SHIFT+1!!&quot; .. So I&#39;d just like to see what they&#39;re doing when I&#39;m not playing..</description>
