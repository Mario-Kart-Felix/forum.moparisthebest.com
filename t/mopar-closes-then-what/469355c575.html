        <p>[quote=“halflive9, post:99, topic:469355”]I have read the first two pages or so and then stopped reading. So don’t kill me if I say something that has been said. I’ve seen multiple persons asking why the younger generation and other players go to r-s. Someone have suggested badges and I do think it has to do something with that. On r-s you have the thank system and you also have the how more you post the higher ‘rank’ you get. You get something for posting on the forums. Something like our old rep system and the moparian reward for the 2000 posts made. You get recognition for your posts and work. Isn’t that what we all want. Something in return for our effort and time. I think that is more appealing at r-s. Especially for the younger generations coming in. As a kid all I wanted was that 200 rep and that moparian rank. Now it really doesn’t bother me that much anymore. I’ve learned here that it’s better to make a good server or post and get no recognition at all than to re-release something bad or make some stupid posts and get thanked, repped and honored. The best thing is to give something back to the community as they helped me getting this ‘far’. As for the runescape cheating part? It never was a big deal on these forums. It always was about the private server creating. That’s what I know moparscape for.[/quote]Yeah, everybody pretended rep wasn’t a big deal but was probably a major driver in how much they contributed to the community.</p>

When the last divide happened, I was one of the people who went to sythe. I’m not even active there anymore, but I can say that site has no potential on changing the cheating scene. Years ago they had some great programmers who chose sythe over srl, mitb, etc but they are since gone. No cheating has happened on MITB in years, so whatever is around now will remain(RID, Villavu, etc)</p>
<p>Now I don’t think any member from this site has the capability to do that as well. IMO RL AND R-S are far more progressive than our site and will continue to be the top sites(server wise). All that will remain in terms of mopar is <span class="hashtag">#Mopar</span>(a testament to what happened with the death of MITB forums).</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>I just wonder where the member base will flock to. Sadly, I agree with you on the RL and R-S opinion. That would really spell the end to what you and I knew as ‘Runescape Cheating’.[/quote]<span class="hashtag">#mitb</span> would still be alive and well.</p>

I have read the first two pages or so and then stopped reading. So don’t kill me if I say something that has been said. I’ve seen multiple persons asking why the younger generation and other players go to r-s. Someone have suggested badges and I do think it has to do something with that. On r-s you have the thank system and you also have the how more you post the higher ‘rank’ you get. You get something for posting on the forums. Something like our old rep system and the moparian reward for the 2000 posts made. You get recognition for your posts and work. Isn’t that what we all want. Something in return for our effort and time. I think that is more appealing at r-s. Especially for the younger generations coming in. As a kid all I wanted was that 200 rep and that moparian rank. Now it really doesn’t bother me that much anymore. I’ve learned here that it’s better to make a good server or post and get no recognition at all than to re-release something bad or make some stupid posts and get thanked, repped and honored. The best thing is to give something back to the community as they helped me getting this ‘far’. As for the runescape cheating part? It never was a big deal on these forums. It always was about the private server creating. That’s what I know moparscape for.<br>
[/quote]Yeah, everybody pretended rep wasn’t a big deal but was probably a major driver in how much they contributed to the community.[/quote]<br>
I can definitely say in the past when I was younger, it was like that for me. As sad as that is but I do believe you’re right for about most of the people here, at least once in their past here.</p>

<p>Yeah when i was a bit younger and way more into rsps rep actually mattered a shit ton to me. Eventually you realized after being apart of the community for so long (and being at the cap of 200) that it was literally worthless. I was eventually rep locked for abuse, even though i don’t remember there being any guidelines for how to use it. Which now that I think about it was probably a huge problem. There were no guidelines and few rules to go along with it so basically you just did whatever you wanted. It became a ‘oh this post is funny here is some rep’ instead of ‘this is a good contribution to the community, here’s some rep’.</p>

No, I’m going to ask a global community who are collectively very knowledgable and actually give constructive answers.</p>
