        <p>As you all know, the scene of Runescape cheating has gone through many changes. Originally it started with a select few people who developed applications allowing for players to have an unfair advantage. ‘Auto-clickers’ and loads of other VB applications were released. Eventually, cheating progressed and the key individuals created their communities as well as their own little programs. The community before moparscape? Mitb. The community before Mitb? Kaitnieks. Follow the line back and it takes you back to a place called Bovine. Throw RSCN in there somewhere too. Even earlier? I believe it was the Free Games Forum but my memory is foggy. We’re talking a decade i think now.</p>
<p>Each time a community was shut down, another rose up. The new community was always filled with the older members. The soul of Runescape cheating was the experienced. The people carried on the information, community to community. It was common to see staff from a shut down place, create the next part of the story. Mopar himself was staff at Kaitnieks. As are many of the long-time staff here.</p>
<p>So what do you believe will happen once Mopar closes? Will a staff member here create the next watering hole for keen cheaters? Villavu has always remained strong, having it’s backbone as Simba. There’s always been the other side of the scene too. The ugly cousin i guess. Sythe. It too has it’s own timeline. RuneCMS. However, Sythe chose to dedicate most of his forums to marketplace.</p>
<p>I think the end of Mopar will spell the death for the scene. It’s too diluted with private servers, no important information is documented and a lot of the knowledgeable members have left a long time go. The landscape has changed.</p>
<p>Opinions?</p>

<p>I just wonder where the member base will flock to. Sadly, I agree with you on the RL and R-S opinion. That would really spell the end to what you and I knew as ‘Runescape Cheating’.</p>
<p>Ideally, Villavu would gain more popularity and prune out majority of the private server crowd. Leaving a fresh foundation to rebuild on.</p>

        <p>News flash: RL is dead. Ikiliki has recruited a handful of people to try and revive the site.</p>
<p>R-S on the other hand, not so dead. Mopar is not fairing as well as R-S, but is doing better than RL.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>The RL toplist isn’t dead though. I guess that’s a kinda +1 for them.</p>

        <p>My ~5,000 posts would go to waste.</p>
<p>In my opinion, some of the arrogant members would attempt to re-create it. We’ve seen it before, and it has always failed. If a staff member, or long-timer tried to bring it back, I don’t see it going all too well, I don’t believe that he or she could generate the necessary funds and support to keep it open. One of the crutches for this place is the Server Help section, which really doesn’t have a steady foundation, and alone couldn’t populate all the other boards that it would take to call this an “active” forum.</p>
<p>Enough rabbit trails though, bottom line, only people who could keep it alive if did fall, would be you (Tree), casey., and some of the other long-time members. If Mopar ever does fall, I’ll probably just drop Java and go onto learn other languages. Not too many strong communities for Java programming anymore. Especially not game development…</p>

Is it some sort of organizational problem we have here? I’ve noticed this for ages, aside from the random crosspost from R-S, it seems like those members don’t want to post here at all. What does Rune-Server have that we don’t? Is it really things like the badges and such that appeals to them?</p>
<p>But yea, I laugh at saying R-L is more progressive than us, that site has been completely dead for ages <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

        <p>I honestly believe someone will revive the whole mopar scene, personally if I was doing it I wouldn’t have split into several different forums boards; I’d keep it as one. If no-one else was going to re-launch it I’d happily do it myself, I wouldn’t want to see it all going to waste.</p>
<p>As to RL and R-S being more progressive than us, no. RL is fucked, completely and utterly fucked. R-S however seems to have some way of attracting new members that we don’t. I honestly think it has something to do with their forums themes appealing more to the younger generation. When a lot of people see the default SMF theme it often makes them “cringe” or whatever you’d like to call it, I don’t see what their problem is; I think it’s very visually appealing. I think R-S is very, very disorganized in their board structure as well, they just have a mind fuck of boards here there and everywhere.</p>
<p>TL;DR Someone will create somewhere for MITB/MSCP/MCFT members to go, they wouldn’t be left in the open. R-S is shit.</p>

        <p>Before I resigned as moderator I suggested that these forums all return into one, I think the split is one of the biggest issues you are facing when trying to get people to even consider Runescape cheating. I was one of the first to suggest moving everything private server related to a new site and really have regretted the decision for awhile now.</p>
<p>However, I am not really sure if anyone has an interest to actaully bot runescape anymore. It seems they are doing a great effort to remove the grind which was the main reason behind such popularity with botting.  Although I don’t personally play the game anymore I do read the updates from time to time and it seems thats the direction they are taking.</p>
<p>You also have to remember that Runescape has a significant flaw. it’s economy the game world generates massive amounts of wealth but does very little to remove any of it. dropping the gold prices and causing massive inflation for rares. This removes the desire for anyone looking to commercially bot.</p>
<p>Finally we can’t forget impsoft. All of our members with the vast runescape cheating knowledge are generally over the age of 18 and live in the united states or U.K. even Speljohan was served a cease and desist order. I don’t think any of us really want to do anything that could potentially risk our real lives just to cheat in some shitty mmorpg.</p>
<p>Finally to answer the question I assume if this site was to ever die you would see about 4 or 5 of our prominent members start forums and split the community further.</p>

        <p>Most of the good programmers who have gone to college don’t care about private servers.</p>
<p>Moparscape is where everyone comes first because of google, so there will be a high count of people who don’t get it and basically suck.

<p>If our vet system didn’t blow dick (bar is too high, too hard to deal with getting into so most cba) and we actually gave good up to experienced developers their own section we’d see alot more progression over here. R-S is just a hangout for the better than average programmers.</p>
<p>It’s an infinite loop here. The good developers won’t stay because they can’t get any help here, they pretty much top everyone who is into servers. They WOULD get help and progression if the same batch of developers before them hadnt ran off to R-S for the same reasons.</p>
<p>So everytime we get a good developer it splits. Almost everyone who is willing to help knows less than them. Everyone who knows more than them is at r-s.</p>

<p>I personally feel that most people over at R-S are actually fairly stupid, as I’m pretty active over there. Basically you have the really good people, and then the rest are just really stupid.</p>
<p>Most the good programmers over there are banned on mopar, or just roam these forums without posting.</p>

I couldn’t agree with this more, the “pioneers” (for want of a better word) of RS cheating and hacking have all outgrown their time causing havoc for a simple mmorpg. Not just because they’ve received legal threats but they’re just not interested anymore. However, if we move moparscape back to <a href="http://mitb.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">mitb.com</a> I do think it’ll directly benefit people getting interested in RS hacking and cheating.</p>

Now I don’t think any member from this site has the capability to do that as well. IMO RL AND R-S are far more progressive than our site and will continue to be the top sites(server wise). All that will remain in terms of mopar is <span class="hashtag">#Mopar</span>(a testament to what happened with the death of MITB forums).<br>
[/quote]I don’t really know any of them, but why do the new ‘progressive’ members go to R-S instead of here? Is it some sort of organizational problem we have here? I’ve noticed this for ages, aside from the random crosspost from R-S, it seems like those members don’t want to post here at all. What does Rune-Server have that we don’t? Is it really things like the badges and such that appeals to them?</p>
<p>But yea, I laugh at saying R-L is more progressive than us, that site has been completely dead for ages :P[/quote]<br>
It’s the place where you can be really, really stupid but still have people think you’re smart.</p>

</aside>
<p>The reason our sights are set so high is because of <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>, a lot of them are very good programmers and program for a living. That way for someone to receive recognition on this site they must be on par with them, while the average age of the user on this site is going up slowly but surely; they still don’t seem to have the motivation to properly learn a language. If they properly learned a language and didn’t post stupid remarks then we wouldn’t be fighting a losing battle.</p>
<p>You said about giving more advanced programmers their own categories and stuff, just send them to <a href="http://mitb.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">mitb.com</a>.</p>

<p>Well as far as I can see no-one actually suggests change much, if we do Taharok usually has a good reason for shooting it down. I think the best suggestion that was ever created in the short time the suggestions board was here was to merge the sites back to <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a></p>
