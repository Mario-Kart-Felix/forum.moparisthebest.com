    <description>Hmm yes. I don&#39;t see why moparclassic not running with NETTY?
The latency is so freaky slow.

Could someone explain why it has not been implemented in first place. I have always wondered why too use MINA instead of NETTY anyway.</description>

<p>StorkPK as far as i remember, is dual threaded and not dynamic, which isn’t that hard, however when you add the ability to do x amount of threads you need to do things differently. Writing a server from the ground up isn’t that hard to do with multi threading, but turning the current RSCD sources to having dynamic threading is a different story, not only do you need to change code in hundreds of areas, you need to find them as you play.</p>
<p>At projectrsc, someone else put the multi threading in, and whilst it might have worked well with 1 person online, it was a different story with lots of others, andi wasn’t going to run around patching up each part of code when the server went live, as it would have felt like a disgustingly unfinished server with bugs left right and center.</p>
<p>the performance gain wasn’t worth the amount of time, or crashes/bugs the server would face, not to mention people want the server out now, not next year.</p>

I do know the current version of prsc doesn’t use multi threading and does use netty and as CFF said, there is no reason netty would make the server feel lower latency than mina, the reason prsc feels lower latency is because a lot more data is sent instantly to the client instead of waiting for the server loop.</p>
