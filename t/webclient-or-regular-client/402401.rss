    <title>Webclient or Regular Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-or-regular-client/402401</link>
    <description>So I made this beatiful server with a client to go with it. I was also planning on putting my server on rsps-hq.com but they are down now. So I go to my client and it got corrupted somehow. So my base is Project Insanity. I need someone to direct me to a place to get a good client or help me in TV to get everything in the client to match my server. And if there are any Weblcient makers I would love to know because the one I wanted to use is now gone. Thanks, Tyler</description>

              <p>If you use the Tut i can make your own web client and host your self and if it’s a<br>
Pi client just go to server downloads and grab any pi client there all the same and work with all server unless they have been made not to but most off them aren’t.</p>
<p>as for the moparscape web host i have no idea how to use that it’s never worked for me.</p>
