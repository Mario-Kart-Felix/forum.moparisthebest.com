    <title>That player has been elimanated</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/that-player-has-been-elimanated/256797</link>
    <description>Hi guys. I need some help with dueling. Everytime I try and duel someone. I can attack him, but they can&#39;t attack me or vice versa. It says that player has been elimaneted. How can I fix that ? 

Thanks in advance.
