    <title>Booting to a partition as if it was a disk?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/booting-to-a-partition-as-if-it-was-a-disk/437057</link>
    <description>does anyone know how I would go about this? I reinstalled windows 7 but it was 32 bit instead of 64 bit. I dont have any dvds atm or i wouldnt bother. so i created a 4gb partition on my hdd formatted it like you would do to a usb to make it bootable to install 7, copied the data from the iso to the new partition. I am now stuck on booting to the partition. I believe i need to set it as active and primary but not certain how to do that(doesnt give me the option in disk management, i guess i could use command-line with diskpart but dont want to mess anything up). I think i would have to use bcdedit but no idea what arguments to pass to it. I was looking at this http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee829683(v=ws.10).aspx but i have no idea how an install disk boots. does it call boot/bcd, bootmgr(.efi) or none of those. It would just probably be easier to just shrink the partition on my 16gb flash drive and make a 4gb partition and make it boot, etc.</description>
