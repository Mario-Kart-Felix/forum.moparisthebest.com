    <title>Trugul - Social Random chat idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trugul-social-random-chat-idea/549315</link>
    <description>So i had a sudden idea and that is make a omegle like website but more secure using social networking API and user accounts you could search for people looking for help in math, gaming , web development, you could add tags to your account and get a list of random people with the same interest of course this is just a idea and i was wondering what you guys would think! also do you guys think this would be a good learning process for me to do</description>

              <p>Doesn’t omegle already let you type in your interests and it matches you with similar people? So just omegle + social media logins and the ability to search for users as oppose to getting a random connection? Do I still have to add them before I can just bust in on their webcams? Sounds like a fuckload of hassle for me to just get my cock out for some strangers</p>

<p>if you’re aiming towards educational tutoring and help, I’d say focus on a forum and integrate a peer-to-peer video/audio chat plugin/api etc.[/quote]<br>
how did you get from math to guys jerking off…</p>
<p>As for the idea itself I guess you would want to look at online courses they generally have session abilities where instructors can webcam. I’ve only had a few online courses in my lifetime and not a single instructor actually used that feature so it might be undesirable.</p>
