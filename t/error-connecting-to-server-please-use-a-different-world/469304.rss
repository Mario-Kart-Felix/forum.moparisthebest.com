    <title>&quot;Error connecting to server. Please use a different world&quot;?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server-please-use-a-different-world/469304</link>
    <description>Should be an easy fix, right? Well I believe I&#39;ve tried everything  . I can&#39;t log in to my server but I have already tried going into the client.java folder and switched the client IP to local (both 127.0.0.1 &amp; 0.0.0.0), neither have worked, and I tried putting my host name (infernopkz.no-ip.org) in the file and it also didnt work... Can someone please help me? I&#39;ve been trying to fix this for 2 days and I&#39;ve tried everything I googled but nothing will work. I&#39;ve even tried downloading different server/clients and get the same exact thing. I&#39;ve posted 2 threads on the forum and nobody will reply. Someone please help!  

EDIT:
Btw, I&#39;m almost positive I set the caches in the right spot.
I even went to the signlink.java and I have the cache where the directory leads to.
I&#39;m running on the InsidiaX v2 source/client if that helps too.
I tried other client/sources too and the same thing happens every time...
maybe it&#39;s something with my computer or maybe over the few months
I stopped coding I just forgot what I was doing?? :confused:</description>

<p>Yes, there are multiple things which can prevent you from Hosting your Server properly. Most of them are listed in the Tutorial you’ve been following. What type of Operating System are you running? The more information you supply in a Thread such as this; the better the chance of catching the solution.</p>
<p>P.S. Link me to what you’ve been following, please.[/quote]</p>
<p>Okay the problem was fixed after I set a static ip to my computer. It was letting me log in after that but that same day I unplugged my computer and brought it to my friends house and now it doesnt work again. I tried to set the static ip again but now it doesnt make a difference… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

<p>I have tried everything I’ve searched over the last few days. I’ve posted 3 threads on the forum and nobody has helped. I believe InsidiaX is a 317 server and I have tried exception in my firewall, I even turned it off at a point and it still didn’t work. It doesnt have any errors in the prompt although I do know for sure it’s a j5_connect error because the other server/clients I’ve downloaded have all had that error in the prompt when I tried logging in.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>It sounds like you haven’t done something properly such as Port-Forwarding. A [quote]j5_disconnect error[/quote] is usually caused by the Client not making a connection to the Server. This Error is usually only displayed in the Prompt in higher Revisions, as higher Revisions are usually the only ones who do this when they are unable to connect. The Error Return Message which your Title is based on is usually a 317 Based Client’s way of saying this as well.[/quote]</p>
<p>When I go to <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> it tells me they can see my port and that it’s open.</p>
<p>Directly from the site:</p>
<p>Success: I can see your service on <strong>.</strong>*.***.*** on port (43594)<br>
Your ISP is not blocking port 43594</p>
<p>And Idk if this helps or not but I was running another server on my old desktop and it worked fine. When I had to get rid of the desktop I transferred the files onto my laptop and it didn’t work anymore. All I did to the files was change to my laptops jdk version in the .bat files.</p>

I can’t log in to my server but I have already tried going into the client.java folder and switched the client IP to local (both 127.0.0.1 &amp; 0.0.0.0), neither have worked, and I tried putting my host name (<a href="http://infernopkz.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">infernopkz.no-ip.org</a>) in the file and it also didnt work… Can someone please help me? I’ve been trying to fix this for 2 days and I’ve tried everything I googled but nothing will work. I’ve even tried downloading different server/clients and get the same exact thing. I’ve posted 2 threads on the forum and nobody will reply. Someone please help!</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Btw, I’m almost positive I set the caches in the right spot.<br>
I even went to the signlink.java and I have the cache where the directory leads to.<br>
I’m running on the InsidiaX v2 source/client if that helps too.<br>
I tried other client/sources too and the same thing happens every time…<br>
maybe it’s something with my computer or maybe over the few months<br>
I stopped coding I just forgot what I was doing?? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
