    <title>[HELP]317 Delta Problem-Problem with Hosting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-317-delta-problem-problem-with-hosting/463715</link>
    <description>I used to run my server fine, then I got a new computer and am now running the server. When I connect, everything is OK. But when my friend tries to connect, via Hamachi, or my external IP, I get this error message:

[code]Connection from HEATHERBATCHELO:62505
Connection reset
java.net.SocketException: Connection reset
        at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(Unknown Source)
        at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(Unknown Source)
        at client.fillInStream(client.java:14554)
        at client.run(client.java:23815)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)
ClientHandler: Client null disconnected (HEATHERBATCHELO)[/code]

Can I get some help please? Recent changes to server include adding a new Donation Skill -- Levels up and adds an exp bonus. Levels up when you donate, $1-1level. Max level is 150 for all skills and has been even when the server was bigger with more people.

Please help me?

Daniel

PS Need anymore info, just ask.

Friend in same state as me(Nathan): Ran it, logged in well. -- Doesnt live WITH ME.
Friend in diff state(Billy): Ran it, had this problem. -- (obviously) Doesnt live WITH ME.

Nathan, Billy, and I, are on 3 different internet connections. However, Nathan and I have same ISP -- Time Warner Cable/Road Runner. Idk Billy&#39;s ISP.

Both have JRE7 in Program Files(x86)\Java

I dont understand why Billy cant connect. they both downloaded the new client.</description>

              <p>He tried using MoparScape client and still wouldnt let him. (Billy) but Nathan used the client I made, that wouldnt work for Billy and it worked for Nathan</p>
<p>Basically:</p>
<p>Billy used DeathScape Client<br>
Nathan used DeathScape Client</p>
<p>Billy’s wouldnt work<br>
Nathan’s would work</p>
<p>Billy used MoparScape client (on website)<br>
Billy’s wouldnt work</p>
<hr>
<p>Tried with Billy making NEW ACC and that caused the problem<br>
Tried with Billy using ALREADY MADE ACC and that caused the problem</p>
<p>Tried with Nathan making NEW ACC and it worked.</p>
