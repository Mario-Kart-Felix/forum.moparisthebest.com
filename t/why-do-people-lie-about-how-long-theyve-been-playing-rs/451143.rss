    <title>Why do people lie about how long they&#39;ve been playing RS?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-do-people-lie-about-how-long-theyve-been-playing-rs/451143</link>
    <description>I see this all the time on here. People trying to make it seem like they were around for the phat dupe. There&#39;s only so many RSC vets still around, and most of them are not hanging around on private servers.

It&#39;s so silly. Playing RS for 5 years does not make you better than someone who has played for 4 years or 3 years or 2 years or 1 year.</description>

Yes I do. It’s really obvious that who are in the RSC boards nowadays have been around since classic. But yes, I know that it’s common that newfags exaggerate how long have they played.</p>

lots of people in the rsc private server sections were part of the early rsc botting forums and played pretty soon after the game’s release. i think kossu was one of the first 2k people to register for rsc. i played a few months after the initial release. it was pvp +/- 4 levels everywhere except lumbridge and parts of varrock where there were guards who stopped you from attacking (they did the same thing with falador when they opened the city). addy armor was the best armor and a plate was 40k from the champs guild. they still had their original forums where clans were actually fun (sabre vs razor vs cwc). there were only 3 servers that could only hold 1500 players each.</p>
<p>it’s not impossible that there are people who played well over 10 years ago.</p>

              <p>I see this all the time on here. People trying to make it seem like they were around for the phat dupe. There’s only so many RSC vets still around, and most of them are not hanging around on private servers.</p>
<p>It’s so silly. Playing RS for 5 years does not make you better than someone who has played for 4 years or 3 years or 2 years or 1 year.</p>
