Nine hearing will be available to the public, a decision that could prompt Bryant’s defense group to waive the hearing and proceed straight to trial. Your judge said he’d meet with attorneys in the event that immediately before the hearing to determine whether aspects of it should be closed in order to preserve Bryant’s right to a fair trial. Gannett will make a decision during the preliminary experiencing whether there is sufficient evidence to hold Dez bryant for trial.Dez bryant, 25, is charged with sexually assaulting a girl who worked at the mountain resort within Edwards, Colo., where he remained June 30. The la Lakers’ star, who is no cost on $25,000 bond, has said the two got consensual sex.He faces four years to life imprisonment if convicted. Questioned how the trial may affect the Lakers forthcoming season, Bryant’s teammate Shaquille O’Neal told CBS News’ Early Show : “This is either making us stronger, or even make us sluggish, and I’m ready because of it, because I’ve been getting ready myself for it almost all summer.”“I have faith in the actual justice system, therefore I’m just likely to sit back and, you realize, see what happens much like everybody else,” O’Neal explained. "You know, I’m not planning to speculate about what transpired because I don’t know what went down."O’Neal said that upon initial hearing of the suggestions against Bryant, he or she wasn’t shocked, “because on the globe we live in, claims can always be made.”  <a href="http://monsterbeats243.labeautesalonandspa.com/2013/05/30/beats-by-dreputer/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">beats by dreputer</a><br>
