    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paragaming-dedicated-1-3-1-rpg-pvp-towny-mob-arena-server/454069</link>
    <description>The server is a PVP with towny and is fully deidcated! So you won&#39;t have to worry about it being down or waiting for the owner to get on to play! Soon we will be offering a massive and COMPLETELY optional Role Play Main Quest! Play Survival Minecraft with some of the best plugins around or save the world on this Amazing server! 

Paracraft is ran on 8GB of ram, 1TB Bandwith, 1gb/s speed.
We have many plugins from Mob Arena, to Towny for garunteed fun, and protection! We have an auto anti grief and anti cheat plugin so you won&#39;t have people spawning tons and tons of diamonds and not making it fun for anybody. 
We have a easy-to-work-with spawn so you don&#39;t have to claw and bite your way out of spawn.

The server holds a full time creative team for building huge constructs to the server! The staff has been hand picked from trusted and well known players from the original Paracraft and from when we switched To Eldercraft!
