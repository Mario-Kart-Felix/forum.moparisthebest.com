    <title>My C# Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-c-server/279506</link>
    <description>Yea. I got bored and made this. This time, being my 3rd, I tried to make it stable and not suck. This time, the server turned out multi-player and didn&#39;t use 1 thread per client. At most, it uses 3... Or 4... (Can be changed easily. I thought it&#39;d be better to handle connections and networking differently. The other thread was for handling the disconnecting stuff, because that&#39;s checked every second [uses Thread.Sleep]). Honestly, you only need two threads (Unless you want the console to lock up). I felt like adding 4. Flame me for it, I don&#39;t care. It can be changed to your liking.

This server is completely empty. It has packet handling, some server data sending examples, and some other server features. The server data example is the message sending method. I took it straight from a wL server.

The packet handling method I stole from wL, because I of course, don&#39;t know how they work myself. You&#39;ll see how they&#39;re handled in packetHandler.cs.

The server features include...
-Anti-nulls. Infact, it saves some memory if a null connects by not assigning the streams (except the input stream; needed at first). It&#39;d be pointless to assign an array with the length of about 5000 only to not use it.
-Anti DDoS/One connection per IP. This, however, causes a problem with disconnecting (&quot;Connection lost - please wait, etc...&quot;) as it does not log you back in. That&#39;s in the to-do list.
-Logs you out if packets aren&#39;t received within 4 seconds. On the server, packet 0/3 has been sent every second from what I looked at. I see no reason to keep the socket connected and what not if you&#39;re really disconnected.
-The no thread per client?

So yea. I have to look into some further stuff, because the server might lag trying to process all of the networking data for players on one thread.

Now... Actually getting to use the server.

First off, download and instal [url=http://www.microsoft.com/express/download]Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express[/url] (or 2005, or a different compiler). To get C# 2005, you&#39;ll have to Google it. The 2005 products are no longer displayed on the download page.

Next, download the source (at the button of the page) and open the solution or project file (It&#39;ll be the first file you see... Hopefully.) with MS VC#. If you can&#39;t find the file, open MS VC# and click Open Project... And just navigate to the folder. It should show the file. Open it.

You&#39;re good to go. The classes are shown in the right. The rest is self-explanatory.


Now here&#39;s some tutorials.

[b]Adding packet handlers[/b]
Open packetHandler.cs and scroll down to method handlePackets. Add the case of the packet id (For example, you&#39;d put case 103: for commands). Don&#39;t forget the break.

Create a new class (Project &gt; Add Class... &gt; Class name.cs) and make sure it&#39;s public. Create a method and use this for the arguments.
[code]client c[/code]The rest is up to you. To get the packet size and stuff, look at how I did it in the commands class (Which by the way is unfinished. I just felt like testing the packet handler).

Go back to packerHandler.cs and in the handlePackets method, add this code. Replace the stuff in the asterisks.
[code]*classname* *classvariable* = new *classname*();[/code]For an example, look at how I handled commands (A slightly different way, but oh well.)

In the case you added, call the method from the class&#39;s variable. Again, just look at how I did it for the commands.


[b]Allowing reconnect after &quot;Connection lost - please wait...&quot;[/b]
Change the packetTimer check in server.cs (In the checkConnected boolean. It should be something like &quot;Client[connectionID].packetTimer &gt; 3&quot;. Change the 3 to something like 8.

Next, open packetHandler.cs. After the first bracket for the handlePackets method, add this.
[code]            if (c.packetTimer &gt; 3)
            {
                c.outStream.writeByte(0);
                c.flushOutStream();
            }[/code]That writes that the reconnect was a successful login... That is, if the packets keep sending. If the client was trying to reconnect, they will.
EDIT: Apparently, this doesn&#39;t work all the time... I&#39;m not sure if I wrote it right.


That&#39;s all the tutorials.

Anyway, now the credits.
[b]winterLove[/b] - For creating the original winterLove. If I hadn&#39;t tried to recode that or build off of it, I wouldn&#39;t have created this base I&#39;ll probably get flamed for. Also for some stuff in the login method that I commented. Let&#39;s not forget the stream and Cryption classes. OH! And when I accidentally added an un-needed flush in the login (and didn&#39;t know about it), I started copy and pasting his stuff which is why the login might look somewhat like his.
[b]sspoke (bakatool)[/b] - For originally fixing up some stuff in C# wL.
[b]C.odeworkshop[/b] - Might be a bit unexplained, but for how the login works.
[b]Taharok[/b] - For pissing me off into making this go further.
[b]Me[/b] - Obviously, whatever wasn&#39;t credited above.

Hopefully I didn&#39;t forget anyone. I feel like I&#39;m missing something for winterLove though...

Now to all who use this -- I&#39;m not positive it&#39;s actually decent. I can already guess it&#39;s no RS2D, but I&#39;d atleast hope it would be a bit better than winterLove... From what I heard, I do hope.

You can download it as an attachment. Just promise not to be disappointed when it&#39;s got nothing but the basics down. Oh and you might see some unneeded stuff in there, as I was switching it around a lot.

[b]TO DO[/b]
-Make it not automatically disconnect the player after about 10 seconds.
-Player updating (Couldn&#39;t hear that enough)
-The server features, obviously.
[s]-Make it able to connect again after disconnect (I&#39;m guessing removing 1 connection per IP would make it work fine.)[/s]

Anyway, try not to flame too much if you don&#39;t like it. Also, the 2nd folder is named &quot;StableServer&quot; because that&#39;s what I had planned on making it, but I&#39;m not sure if it is or not. So just ignore it...?

Any bugs or something major, post here.

<p>Next step: Loading a map so I can get interfaces and buttons done. Then hopefully make it not autolog out.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Yea. I got bored and made this. This time, being my 3rd, I tried to make it stable and not suck. This time, the server turned out multi-player and didn’t use 1 thread per client. At most, it uses 3… Or 4… (Can be changed easily. I thought it’d be better to handle connections and networking differently. The other thread was for handling the disconnecting stuff, because that’s checked every second [uses Thread.Sleep]). Honestly, you only need two threads (Unless you want the console to lock up). I felt like adding 4. Flame me for it, I don’t care. It can be changed to your liking.</p>
<p>This server is completely empty. It has packet handling, some server data sending examples, and some other server features. The server data example is the message sending method. I took it straight from a wL server.</p>
<p>The packet handling method I stole from wL, because I of course, don’t know how they work myself. You’ll see how they’re handled in packetHandler.cs.</p>
<p>The server features include…<br>
-Anti-nulls. Infact, it saves some memory if a null connects by not assigning the streams (except the input stream; needed at first). It’d be pointless to assign an array with the length of about 5000 only to not use it.<br>
-Anti DDoS/One connection per IP. This, however, causes a problem with disconnecting (“Connection lost - please wait, etc…”) as it does not log you back in. That’s in the to-do list.<br>
-Logs you out if packets aren’t received within 4 seconds. On the server, packet 0/3 has been sent every second from what I looked at. I see no reason to keep the socket connected and what not if you’re really disconnected.<br>
-The no thread per client?</p>
<p>So yea. I have to look into some further stuff, because the server might lag trying to process all of the networking data for players on one thread.</p>
<p>Now… Actually getting to use the server.</p>
<p>First off, download and instal <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/download" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express</a> (or 2005, or a different compiler). To get C# 2005, you’ll have to Google it. The 2005 products are no longer displayed on the download page.</p>
<p>Next, download the source (at the button of the page) and open the solution or project file (It’ll be the first file you see… Hopefully.) with MS VC#. If you can’t find the file, open MS VC# and click Open Project… And just navigate to the folder. It should show the file. Open it.</p>
<p>You’re good to go. The classes are shown in the right. The rest is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Now here’s some tutorials.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Adding packet handlers</span><br>
Open packetHandler.cs and scroll down to method handlePackets. Add the case of the packet id (For example, you’d put case 103: for commands). Don’t forget the break.</p>
<p>Create a new class (Project &gt; Add Class… &gt; Class name.cs) and make sure it’s public. Create a method and use this for the arguments.</p>
<p><code>client c</code>The rest is up to you. To get the packet size and stuff, look at how I did it in the commands class (Which by the way is unfinished. I just felt like testing the packet handler).</p>
<p>Go back to packerHandler.cs and in the handlePackets method, add this code. Replace the stuff in the asterisks.</p>
<p><code>*classname* *classvariable* = new *classname*();</code>For an example, look at how I handled commands (A slightly different way, but oh well.)</p>
<p>In the case you added, call the method from the class’s variable. Again, just look at how I did it for the commands.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Allowing reconnect after “Connection lost - please wait…”</span><br>
Change the packetTimer check in server.cs (In the checkConnected boolean. It should be something like “Client[connectionID].packetTimer &gt; 3”. Change the 3 to something like 8.</p>
<p>Next, open packetHandler.cs. After the first bracket for the handlePackets method, add this.</p>
<p><code>            if (c.packetTimer &gt; 3)
            {
                c.outStream.writeByte(0);
                c.flushOutStream();
            }</code>That writes that the reconnect was a successful login… That is, if the packets keep sending. If the client was trying to reconnect, they will.<br>
EDIT: Apparently, this doesn’t work all the time… I’m not sure if I wrote it right.</p>
<p>That’s all the tutorials.</p>
<p>Anyway, now the credits.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">winterLove</span> - For creating the original winterLove. If I hadn’t tried to recode that or build off of it, I wouldn’t have created this base I’ll probably get flamed for. Also for some stuff in the login method that I commented. Let’s not forget the stream and Cryption classes. OH! And when I accidentally added an un-needed flush in the login (and didn’t know about it), I started copy and pasting his stuff which is why the login might look somewhat like his.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">sspoke (bakatool)</span> - For originally fixing up some stuff in C# wL.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">C.odeworkshop</span> - Might be a bit unexplained, but for how the login works.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Taharok</span> - For pissing me off into making this go further.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Me</span> - Obviously, whatever wasn’t credited above.</p>
<p>Hopefully I didn’t forget anyone. I feel like I’m missing something for winterLove though…</p>
<p>Now to all who use this – I’m not positive it’s actually decent. I can already guess it’s no RS2D, but I’d atleast hope it would be a bit better than winterLove… From what I heard, I do hope.</p>
<p>You can download it as an attachment. Just promise not to be disappointed when it’s got nothing but the basics down. Oh and you might see some unneeded stuff in there, as I was switching it around a lot.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">TO DO</span><br>
-Make it not automatically disconnect the player after about 10 seconds.<br>
-Player updating (Couldn’t hear that enough)<br>
-The server features, obviously.<br>
<span class="bbcode-s">-Make it able to connect again after disconnect (I’m guessing removing 1 connection per IP would make it work fine.)</span></p>
<p>Anyway, try not to flame too much if you don’t like it. Also, the 2nd folder is named “StableServer” because that’s what I had planned on making it, but I’m not sure if it is or not. So just ignore it…?</p>
<p>Any bugs or something major, post here.</p>
