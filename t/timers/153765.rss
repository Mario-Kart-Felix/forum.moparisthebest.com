    <title>Timers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/timers/153765</link>
    <description>I&#39;m making a type of c wars, it is coming along good, except one thing.  I have a timer set so every like 10 minutes the people are taken into the game, but everyone&#39;s timer is different.  The timer is in public boolean process so it is being called every 500 ms, but the timer doesn&#39;t start for each person until they log in.  If my timer is like at 500 and someone just logs in their&#39;s starts at 999 and we don&#39;t get into c wars at same time.  How do i make the timer&#39;s so it is just one timer, not everyone has their own timer.  All help is greatly appreciated.</description>
