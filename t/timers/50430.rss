    <description>Well, I have NEVER posted a thread here needing help because I try to learn on my own, BUT...
I just can&#39;t figure out how to get this done.

Currently I am working on my own little minigame, and it is gong along AWESOME. I am trying to add a timer(somewhat like cw in real runescape) that will tele you to the game once the time is up. Currently I am using process() and an int that goes down every minute, then says how many minutes are left. There&#39;s one problem with that. The timer is different for all people, because they log in at different times. =\

How do I get an int to be the same for all, and subtract at the same time as everyone else? If somebody could help me I would greatly appreciate it, because this is about all that&#39;s keeping me from releasing/putting up my server. ^_^
