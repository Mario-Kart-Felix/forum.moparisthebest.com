    <title>Byzantium - 2007 Content - Custom Content - 667 Items - Balanced Bug Abuse</title>

    <description>Byzantium is a new type of RSPS. Rather than attempting to stop bug abuse by banning abusers and patching all bugs, bugscape attempts to balance bug abuse by creating glitches that are fun to exploit and have a moderate reward for performing them. Dupes and pvp bugs are the only bugs which are actively patched. This means that the bugs which are intentionally left in serve to benefit bug abusers, but not to harm normal players in any way. Of course, we accept the fact that new exploits will be found and reward those who find dupes or pvp bugs accordingly. Our server is sponsored by the RSPS glitching forum Rspunit, and as such bug abusers are our primary player base.

[B]Bug Credits[/B]
Smuggling certain items or stances on the server will allow you to trade them in for bug credits. You can also rarely obtain bug credits from slayer. Bug credits are a newpoints integrated point shop system, which allows you to use both the bug credit shop on the server as well as the various gambling plugins found on the RSPUnit / bugscape forums located at [url=http://rspunit.pw/]RSPUnit[/url]

More coming soon...

[B]XP[/B]
Bugscape has a comfortable 20x xp rate for most stats, with combat stats buffed to 25x. There are also XP lamps which you can purchase for bug credits, that yield a significant amount of exp based on level. 

[B]Slayer[/B]
All slayer targets will ALWAYS drop gp, so if you&#39;re in need of cash you can just run some slayer. The minimum GP drop is 100gp, but it goes up to 3k at the upper limit of a rare GP drop. We feature the slayer tower, the fremmenik slayer dungeon, and all other major slayer locations with the exception of the gnome stronghold dungeon.

 
[B]But I can&#39;t bug abuse
[/B]While our server is primarily dedicated to glitches, there is also tons of content for regular players as well. If you just want a server with a relaxed XP rate, tons of fun content, and one of the most fun communities of people you&#39;ll find on an RSPS look no further. If your goal is to learn bug abuse, that&#39;s fine too. We&#39;re currently even developing a bug abuse quest to help beginners learn the ropes. No matter your experience level, you&#39;ll find your niche.
