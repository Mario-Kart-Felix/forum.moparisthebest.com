    <title>Public static void objectExists?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/public-static-void-objectexists/316974</link>
    <description>ok heres my problem. im trying to make mining where when a set number of ores run out the rock disappears. 

here is how it would be used
[code]
if(objectID == 2096) {
   mine(blah, blah, blah);
   miningId = objectID;
   miningX = objectX;
   miningY = objectY;
}

public void mine(int ore, int xp, int amount) {
  if(objectExists(miningId, miningX, miningY) {
     //do whatever;
  } 
  amount--;
  if(amount &lt;= 0) {
    deleteObject(miningX, miningY);
  }
}[/code]

i can make the other voids, i just need something that would work as objectExists to

i no in itemhandler there is a void called ItemExists for picking up items, but i tryed to modify it for objecthandler. it didnt work because everything in object handler at been scrapped and it really didnt change anything so i removed it

it doesnt matter what source im using, cause its pretty much custom, but the original was based on devo 6.0</description>
