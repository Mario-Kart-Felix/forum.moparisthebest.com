    <title>Approval of my sponsor?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/approval-of-my-sponsor/360210</link>
    <description>I find this very unreliable, as you correctly said that it will be approved by a moderator within 24-48 hours it has been well past that (4 days, and still not a reply) and i can guarantee i wait a week and its still not approved, also i have a question:

I am willing to pay the minimum $30 as it&#39;s all i can afford to give for a sponser, and will i go on the sponser list straight after, or next month?</description>

$30 will not get you at sponsor spot, you will need at least 300+ since most of the severs up there blow out 300-400 a month on status.<br>

Indeed, they just sneak into their mom’s room and take her purse looking for her credit card and she dont care, well I’m sorry, that kind of money could be used to rent a house, so I guess I was right he was gonna take my $30 and i won’t be on it, wanting me to spend more, money like that shouldn’t be wasted on a pixel game only if your an big ass company that doesn’t mess with other’s work Ah well I guess Mopar is making money a.ka. His irl job.<br>
A suggestion: why won’t you make it so you can delete your own server, only if it’s been up for 2 days and is offline?</p>

Well thanks i didn’t know it would take 2 weeks, and say if I were to sponsor $30 would you just take it and not put me on sponsor list because your way of biding sounds like that to me? or will I be put on but I’d be randomized every time the page is reloaded or something? idk, can you explain please.</p>
