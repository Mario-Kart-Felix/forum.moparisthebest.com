    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-zones-and-putting-objects-like-a-bank-booth/321893</link>
    <description>when you teleport to camelot it puts you in front of that mansion.
and theres that gate.
well what i want to do is make the outside of that gate safezone and then when you go in itll be pk, and how to make it non multi combat.
and then set a timer saying you must wait 10 seconds after combat before you can leave pk.
but if timer is unavailable its ok, i still want to know how to put a pk zone. [br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 25, 2009, 04:39:18 am[/size][hr]**************** ALSO VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!

and then make it say like d claws are 60 pk points.
you dont have enough points to buy this.

or something.
