It seems to me that rappers today, talk about killing people. People did that back in the day of pac too, but today there more 'open' about it.

<p>Even still, getting shot is nothing to be bragging about, yeah its fine if your using it to get back at the people who shot you ‘5 shots couldn’t drop me, i took it n smiled’.<br>
Rap started off as, a ‘who is better’ game, like in the rap battles, you would big yourself up, put on this big hard attitude to try and intimidate your opponent and was never meant to be anything more than just rapping against each other.</p>
<p>Oh and before ANY of you say ‘tupac was killed over some rap shit’, i can tell you now, THAT IS NOT THE REASON.<br>
Tupac was killed because, yeah he had a big mouth, someone trys to do something to him he will get up and make noise, someone got sick of him mouthing off to people and killed him, simple as that, or it could of just been a pay back from that night in vegas when he had that fight with that crip?.</p>
<p>In my opinion, from how i see it biggie was killed in revenge of tupac, because at the time there was loads of speculation going around that it was him who hired to have him shot, although i do not believe this one bit, biggie was not that type of guy.</p>
<p>A theory that i have believed in for quite a long while though is that suge knight had them both killed, because before tupac died, Suge knight owed tupac millions, in royalties and for loads more, and as tupac was in the planning stages of his new record label ‘makaveli records’ tupac would obviously be looking for his money when he left death row, Suge was not prepared to pay him back and killed him, and there is the fact that if tupac went independent, he would of been unstoppable, since he already was at the time at the top of the rap/hip-hop scene and had such a large influence on people, he would of been making millions more than Death row records, and be virtually unstoppable, since he could do what he wanted as he would not be under management.</p>
<p>Biggie was just a victim to all the aftermath of tupacs killing, thats what i believe in anyway.[/quote]</p>
<p>There was a series of killings (more than usual) between Bloods and Crips after Tupac and Notorious B.I.G. were killed. If their deaths can affect west coast gangsters why couldn’t it affect other people? I agree with you, Biggie was killed as a sort of “revenge” killing for Tupac. It’s sad and really doesn’t put a good light on rap as a music but it’s what <span class="bbcode-i">probably</span> happened.</p>

<p>Wow. Wake up and look at the world around you. Rap isn’t the only genre of music with sex and money in it. Although it does have generally more of it (at least the current rap songs do). Not saying I’m a fan of rap, because I’m not. At least not a fan of “today’s rap.”</p>
