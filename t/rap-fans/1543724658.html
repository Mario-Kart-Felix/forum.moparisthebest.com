<p>I agree with Mopman, it‚Äôs certainley not easy to be a good at rapping or to be a good at producing beats. Of course you could judge all rap on British Grime and you would think, this is some of the most pointless shit I have ever allowed to enter into my ears and give me a headache. But there is good rap out there, sometimes you have to look harder, but it is there.</p>
<p>It is the same with other genres. If I was to say something stupid such as, ‚ÄúAll metal sucks because Slipknot suck.‚Äù, many people would be up in arms because that is a blanket statement that judges a whole genre on one band within that genre. But people still manage to do it while describing rap music as a whole, substituting metal and Slipknot with rap and 50 Cent.</p>
<p>I think people should respect other music, and although you may absolutely hate it and it is hard to respect it when you think how shit it really sounds, you have to understand that something that sounds bad to you, sounds great to someone else.</p>
<p>Peace out.</p>

        <p>Oh and the fact that Death row records have many many instrumentalists, such as trumpet players, violin players, EVERYTHING.<br>
I‚Äôm not sure if alot of ‚Äòrappers/hip-hop artists‚Äô use them now but i know for a fact people like snoop Dogg, Tupac, Dr.Dre a lot of what you could call ‚Äòold school‚Äô rappers, although Tupac is fairly recent used them in their songs.</p>

        <p>50cent won‚Äôt say anything good about ANY other rapper, in some interview the interviewer asked ‚Äúwho could win in a rap battle, you or eminem?‚Äù 50 said him, and then said ‚Äúbut if eminem won, then i would go around to his house and shoot him‚Äù, and eminem is supposed to be his friend? he signed him to his fucking label.<br>
He has never actually said anything bad about tupac, but all he said was ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs, he‚Äôs the biggest selling rapper of all time, eveybody has taken something from his music‚Äù, but he is constantly talking about how good he is, about how he is the best.</p>
<p>That 50 cent, and justin timberlake ayo technology is probably the only song that i can stand listening to, because its not his usual shit, even still his voice and way of rapping is so fucking annoying.</p>

<p>You have a really good point there‚Ä¶ That made me think twice about rap music‚Ä¶ Heh.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, I guess the true reason I don‚Äôt like rap is because almost EVERYONE listens to it, it‚Äôs almost ALWAYS whats on the radio, and almost NONE of the music I like is played on the radio. Hell, what‚Äôs wrong with Scary Kids Scaring Kids, The Human Abstract, or Dragonforce? Why can‚Äôt they play them on the radio? It always has to be the crap that everyone else listens to. Rap, rap, and MORE rap. I hate it, it get so damn <span class="bbcode-i">annoying</span>! Everyone‚Äôs asking me ‚ÄúHave you ever heard this song before?‚Äù and then they have me listen to a rap song. Then I say ‚ÄúNo, because I don‚Äôt listen to rap.‚Äù Then I get that weird look like I‚Äôm a retard or something. It‚Äôs just the fact that rap is the majority of the music listened to where I live, and by majority, I mean by about 95% of the people here. So maybe you get a hint of how I feel about it.</p>

<p>Thats true, 50Cent thinks because he got shot 9 times with a pistol.<br>

        <p>Tupac was shot in 1994 5 times, once in the head twice in the ‚Äògroin‚Äô area and once through his hand that hit an artery in his waist and somewhere else that i can‚Äôt remember =, then again in 1996 that punctured his lung that was later removed.</p>
<p>Even still, getting shot is nothing to be bragging about, yeah its fine if your using it to get back at the people who shot you ‚Äò5 shots couldn‚Äôt drop me, i took it n smiled‚Äô.<br>
Rap started off as, a ‚Äòwho is better‚Äô game, like in the rap battles, you would big yourself up, put on this big hard attitude to try and intimidate your opponent and was never meant to be anything more than just rapping against each other.</p>
<p>Oh and before ANY of you say ‚Äòtupac was killed over some rap shit‚Äô, i can tell you now, THAT IS NOT THE REASON.<br>
Tupac was killed because, yeah he had a big mouth, someone trys to do something to him he will get up and make noise, someone got sick of him mouthing off to people and killed him, simple as that, or it could of just been a pay back from that night in vegas when he had that fight with that crip?.</p>
<p>In my opinion, from how i see it biggie was killed in revenge of tupac, because at the time there was loads of speculation going around that it was him who hired to have him shot, although i do not believe this one bit, biggie was not that type of guy.</p>
<p>A theory that i have believed in for quite a long while though is that suge knight had them both killed, because before tupac died, Suge knight owed tupac millions, in royalties and for loads more, and as tupac was in the planning stages of his new record label ‚Äòmakaveli records‚Äô tupac would obviously be looking for his money when he left death row, Suge was not prepared to pay him back and killed him, and there is the fact that if tupac went independent, he would of been unstoppable, since he already was at the time at the top of the rap/hip-hop scene and had such a large influence on people, he would of been making millions more than Death row records, and be virtually unstoppable, since he could do what he wanted as he would not be under management.</p>
<p>Biggie was just a victim to all the aftermath of tupacs killing, thats what i believe in anyway.</p>

<p>There was a series of killings (more than usual) between Bloods and Crips after Tupac and Notorious B.I.G. were killed. If their deaths can affect west coast gangsters why couldn‚Äôt it affect other people? I agree with you, Biggie was killed as a sort of ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù killing for Tupac. It‚Äôs sad and really doesn‚Äôt put a good light on rap as a music but it‚Äôs what <span class="bbcode-i">probably</span> happened.</p>

<blockquote>What else could i do, i had to feed my fuckin family,
what else could i do, but be a thug, out slangin with the hommies, fuck hangin with the fonnies in the club, got my mind on danger, never been a stranger to homicide, my cities full of gangbangers and drive by's, why do we die at such an early age, he was so young, but still a victim of the 12 guage</blockquote>
that is good stuff right there. now, compare that to this song by 50 cent, called heat
<blockquote>If there's beef, cock it and dump it, the drama really means nothin
To me I'll ride by and blow ya brains out</blockquote>
It seems to me that rappers today, talk about killing people. People did that back in the day of pac too, but today there more 'open' about it.
