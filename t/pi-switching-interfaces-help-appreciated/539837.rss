Ok, so i want to change this interface
I want to keep the text color, but the interface makes it kind of annoying to read.
So what i was thinking was that i could change the interface instead to perhaps a darker one, so it would be easier to read. But i havnt had any success yet, so any help will be appreciated! :)</description>

I told you on IRC. When you change the interface you will also need to update the lines on that interface, interfaces do not share the same text lines. I linked you to Lin’s interface editor on IRC, download that and use it to find your new interface and thus its text lines.<br>
[/quote]<br>
1st, the editor came up with an error it wouldnt even run.<br>
2nd, i have the text lines, but the interface i chose comes up blank anyways.[/quote]You clearly don’t have the right ones, by the way the editor requires the .NET 4.0 framework, try downloading that.</p>
