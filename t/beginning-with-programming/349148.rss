    <title>Beginning With Programming</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/beginning-with-programming/349148</link>
    <description>Ok well heres pretty much the story, if you don&#39;t have time to read it just ignore this topic.

Next semester (which is about 1 month away) I will be taking AP computer science. Course description at the bottom. It doesn&#39;t say it, but I will be programming in Java, which I have no experince (unless you are retarded and count private servers which was 3-5 years ago). Overall I don&#39;t really have much knowledge with programming in general....I took 2 classes in Visual Basic (which was called Programming 1 and Programming 2) but that was just mostly making useless applications, so I don&#39;t count that. I really need to know how an operating system works so I can better understand programming. I don&#39;t want to be completely fucked when I get into the class and I am probably going to be going to University in 2011-2015 for a BS in some computer field (computer science, computer engineering, etc...). All I am asking is where you would tell a person (assumming they had no knowledge of how a computer works or computer programming) to go to start with learning how a computer opearting system works, and where to get started with programming (java). I know someone of you will say the java docs website, but I prefer books and not internet resources (even though alot are good). So If any of you could tell me of any books to get started with (ebooks maybe) and if you must some websites. I would like to have the BASICS down in a week at most. I need to glance over my grammar book and calc book with the remaining time before school.

&lt;blockquote&gt;AP Computer Science A
Course Code: 25084
Course Level: Advanced Placement
Course Offering: Year-long for 1 credit
Course Description
This course differs from the A/B class in depth, scope, and pace. This
AP Computer Science course is an introductory course in computer
science. Because the development of computer programs to solve
problems is a skill fundamental to the study of computer science, a
large part of the course is built around the development of computer
programs or parts of programs that correctly solve a given problem.
The course also emphasizes the design issues that make programs
understandable, adaptable, and, when appropriate, reusable. At the
same time, the development of useful computer programs and classes
is used as a context for introducing other important concepts in
computer science, including the development and analysis of
algorithms, the development and use of fundamental data structures,
and the study of standard algorithms and typical applications.
Computer Science A emphasizes object-oriented programming
methodology with an emphasis on problem solving and algorithm
development and is meant to be the equivalent of a first-semester
course in computer science. It also includes the study of data
structures and abstraction, but these topics are not covered to the
extent that they are covered in Computer Science AB. For more
information on the content covered by the AP course and exam, please
visit:
http://www.collegeboard.org/ap/students/compsci/index.html
This class is available to any student who has completed Algebra I and
is interested in learning to program at the college level. This is a
college level class and will move at a considerably faster pace than the
typical high school class. Students should be prepared to complete
outside readings and spend many hours on the computer. You must be
willing to share and help classmates throughout this class with their
programming assignments. The instructor will monitor the support
given to students and will intervene only when necessary.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>Class was not hard overall, exam had some tough questions but not too bad. You have to solve all the problems in your head, no compiler allowed. The only one/two I think I missed were crazy recursion questions. There’s also a free response section where you have to write code from scratch. For example, one of the problems was to implement a “Line” class with a constructor and a few methods dealing with whether given points were on the line etc.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well that last thing you just said just took my hide on a ride. Then again I just started learning java and the class is 2 semesters long <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Thanks for the help though</p>

It doesn't mention that you need even basic programming knowledge. And the course description says the main part of your course is algorithms and basic data structures, which should be easy enough as long as you're actually taught it and given the relevant books+resources.

<blockquote>AP Computer Science A
Course Code: 25084
Course Level: Advanced Placement
Course Offering: Year-long for 1 credit
Course Description
This course differs from the A/B class in depth, scope, and pace. This
AP Computer Science course is an introductory course in computer
science. Because the development of computer programs to solve
problems is a skill fundamental to the study of computer science, a
large part of the course is built around the development of computer
programs or parts of programs that correctly solve a given problem.
The course also emphasizes the design issues that make programs
understandable, adaptable, and, when appropriate, reusable. At the
same time, the development of useful computer programs and classes
is used as a context for introducing other important concepts in
computer science, including the development and analysis of
algorithms, the development and use of fundamental data structures,
and the study of standard algorithms and typical applications.
Computer Science A emphasizes object-oriented programming
methodology with an emphasis on problem solving and algorithm
development and is meant to be the equivalent of a first-semester
course in computer science. It also includes the study of data
structures and abstraction, but these topics are not covered to the
extent that they are covered in Computer Science AB. For more
information on the content covered by the AP course and exam, please

http://www.collegeboard.org/ap/students/compsci/index.html
This class is available to any student who has completed Algebra I and
is interested in learning to program at the college level. This is a
college level class and will move at a considerably faster pace than the
typical high school class. Students should be prepared to complete
outside readings and spend many hours on the computer. You must be
willing to share and help classmates throughout this class with their
programming assignments. The instructor will monitor the support
given to students and will intervene only when necessary.</blockquote>
