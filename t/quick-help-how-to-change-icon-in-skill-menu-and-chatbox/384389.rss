    <title>[Quick Help?] How to change icon in skill menu and chatbox?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quick-help-how-to-change-icon-in-skill-menu-and-chatbox/384389</link>
    <description>Hello! Can anyone please tell me how can i change, for example, [u]Agility icon in skills menu to any other, using custom sprite[/u]? Maybe not to change, just to put any other icon on it... Well, basically I just need to repalce agility with another skill...

[b]This one:[/b]

[b]And also that one in chatbox, that appears on level up:[/b](ignore the hp icon, was too lazy to go to agility)

Where can i change these? Maybe you can tell me [b]where should i look for it?[/b] Also a tutorial link, how to insert custom sprite and place it somewhere, would be nice.

Also, [b]can I just open cache some how and replace aglity icon with the new one i want?[/b] If that, what cache editor should I use?

P.S. I have a Project-Insanity base.</description>

<p>Didn’t find any in sprites folder. Umm so I can do this with Tom’s Cache Suite? Can you tell me dl link or anything?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT:</span> Found a dl link, now i’m editing the cache. When i put a new icon it doesn’t appear in game! Anyone? Perhaps better would be if it reads from the custom sprite folder…</p>
