    <title>Autotyper request</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/autotyper-request/140156</link>
    <description>I was wondering if anybody had/would make an autotyper that uses hotkeys (f1, f2, etc) that doesn&#39;t use send keys but has human like typing. I&#39;m a really nooby SCAR scripter so idk how to make one...i have one that uses hotkeys but it uses send keys and everyone says that will get u banned really fast. plz help.






EDIT: I changed some things in the one i have it still needs a little work if you want to make it better plz do.

[code]{
 SimpleTalker Program.

 1) Change the sentences inside the &#39; &#39; on lines
 2) Start the script
 3) Press F1 for it to type Sentence 1.
    Press F2 for it to type Sentence 2.
    Press F3 for it to type Sentence 3.

 Made by IP-Drowner in addition to &#39;thenewguy&#39; and &#39;exps35&#39; script(s).
}

Program SimpleTalker;
{.include SRL/SRL.scar}

const
Chat1 = &#39;First sentence here.&#39;;  //Replace the sentence with your own.
Chat2 = &#39;Second sentence here.&#39;; //Replace the sentence with your own.
Chat3 = &#39;Third sentence here.&#39;;  //Replace the sentence with your own.

procedure Const2Text;
begin
   SetupSRL;
   if(IsFKeyDown(1)) then
   TypeSend(Chat1);
   Sleep(71)
   if(IsFKeyDown(2)) then
   TypeSend(Chat2);
   Sleep(69)
   if(IsFKeyDown(3)) then
   TypeSend(Chat3);
   Sleep(62)
end;

begin
 repeat
  Const2Text;
 Until(IsFKeyDown(9))
end.[/code]

I tested it a little and it works fine but it keeps saying SRL compiled in however much time im guessing that is because of this line:
[code]begin
 repeat
  Const2Text;
 Until(IsFKeyDown(9))
end.[/code]
is there any way to stop that? like i said im a nooby SCAR scripter so idk... can i just take that out? idk...






EDIT 2: well i got it working the way I wanted... Ty for all the help -.- oh well i learned some things about SCAR. Here is the finished script if anyone wants it.
