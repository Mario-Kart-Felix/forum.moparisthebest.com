    <title>How To Score Some Extra Minutes Before/During School</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-score-some-extra-minutes-before-during-school/14690</link>
    <description>This is my first tut so be nice  ;) i think some remade versions of this has been posted but who the heck cares eh?

Heres what you will require .. Just Some Magnets , preferably big ones (or alot of small ones)

This works on bells that have a hammer that hits the outer shell when it rings.

Throw a magnet or 2 depending on how big they are. When the magnets are stuck on the outside of the bell,
it will dull the sound of the bell so you can hear a slight clinging sound.

I have tried this several times and it worked. Me and some friends were experimenting with this and created this.
