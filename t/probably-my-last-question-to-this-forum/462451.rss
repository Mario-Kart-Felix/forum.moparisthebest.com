    <title>Probably my last question to this forum</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/probably-my-last-question-to-this-forum/462451</link>
    <description>In all my time here, i think i asked about 5 questions... however, none of them ever got answered (fixed all my problems myself)
but now i have 1 little little problem and if no-one answers this question... i might as well leave... i joined this forum to get help from people...

added jad... max hp is correct, combat is correct everything is correct except...

the attack and defence level, what levels should i give the JAD?

i mean c&#39;mon it doesn&#39;t even have to be 100% accurate... but i want the levels as balanced as possible to make the JAD tough, but not impossible...

CMON! please!!</description>

              <p>well i only tested the jad in the cave (scripted spawn)<br>
and command spawn (instanced, only i can see it)</p>
<p>i will put jad @ home for testing</p>
<p>JAD is the problem, sever crashes when players get near</p>

              <p>I’d say his attack level and defence level should be split into this:<br>
x = CB level<br>
y = Attack level<br>
z = Defence level<br>
y = (x/2) * (2/3)<br>
z = (x/2) * (1/3)</p>
<p>If this doesn’t work out, sorry, I’m only taking a guess. But it seems like a fair system.</p>
