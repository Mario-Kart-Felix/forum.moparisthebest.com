<p>Tired of the slander towards every RSC server (except Rscr, which you act like a total fanboy of in most of your posts)… By stable economy, we mean the items have VALUE.  For example, when players PK, they actually feel a sense of reward since hyperinflation hasn’t taken over this server, like it has others. (this is pretty refreshing, for an RSC server)</p>
<p>Also, we are able to cover the server costs and other expenses through our supporter passes, our donation items, and the infusion of funds from staff members. (which are ALL posted in their respective threads in the Announcements section)  Since we keep a transparent record of the rares that are implemented into the game through donations, there can’t be any confusion about how many rares are in-game, how many colors, and we also show the donator’s in-game name unless they request to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Every rare that is able to be donated for (masks and party hats) are priced identically.  Also, the fact that we stand firm on our donation price of $39.50 (instead of just taking as many lower offers as we can get) is a good indication that we aren’t simply trying to sell as many pixels as possible.</p>
<p>Countless players have asked to buy (for USD) blood runes, dragon meds n sqs, god staffs/capes, points, or just flats.  However, they have all been turned down.  To any reasonable/rational person, this shows we are running this server to make an enjoyable game/community and not for the $$$.  Enough thread derailing, iBoss.  However, I forgive you for being misinformed.  I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you weren’t intentionally trying to slander CirnoPK with a lot of your posts.</p>
<p>Feel free to hop on CirnoPK and you, too, can personally experience our stable economy (as opposed to the other ridiculously inflated servers)</p>
<p>This will be the last time I bother addressing baseless accusations in this official advertising thread for CirnoPK.  If you feel like making claims, fine, but if you expect a response or for anyone to take you seriously, post PROOF.  Oh wait, that’s impossible seeing as your accusations are frivolous.  It’s probably time you just deleted all of your posts and your account (if possible) on Moparscape in order to avoid further embarrassment/ridicule.</p>
<p>Now, lets get back to discussing the real issue here, CirnoPK.  We had <span class="bbcode-b">16 players</span>  online simultaneously earlier this morning.  Our player count, after dipping for a bit, is beginning to steadily climb back up over the last week or so, at least.  I’ve also got an advertising strategy mapped out.  Additionally, I’ve kick started CirnoPK’s advertising budget with $50 of my own personal money.  100% of the proceeds from the next donation item (mask or p hat) will be added to the advertising budget (currently at $50).  After we’ve raised at least $100 to spend on advertising, we will no longer put 100% of the money from a donation item into our advertising budget.  Instead, a fraction of the donation will go toward advertising while the rest sits in savings to ensure we always have enough cash on hand to pay for our (somewhat pricey) dedicated server, DDoS mitigation service, and any other unanticipated expenses.</p>

<p>16 players? This server peaked at a much higher player count months ago. What happened?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Our population dipped for a while, but the last month has seen a decent improvement as far as consistent player counts.  We’ve also begun to host more events in game.[/quote]I played this for a few days when it first came out.<br>
You might want to do something about asshole players, since that’s why I left.<br>

<p>16 players? This server peaked at a much higher player count months ago. What happened?[/quote]<br>
Our population dipped for a while, but the last month has seen a decent improvement as far as consistent player counts.  We’ve also begun to host more events in game.</p>

What do you mean by stable economy? Rares that you sold for cash and also every deals you did under the table = stable economy? Wow… OK<br>
[/quote]<br>
Tired of the slander towards every RSC server (except Rscr, which you act like a total fanboy of in most of your posts)… By stable economy, we mean the items have VALUE.  For example, when players PK, they actually feel a sense of reward since hyperinflation hasn’t taken over this server, like it has others. (this is pretty refreshing, for an RSC server)</p>
<p>Also, we are able to cover the server costs and other expenses through our supporter passes, our donation items, and the infusion of funds from staff members. (which are ALL posted in their respective threads in the Announcements section)  Since we keep a transparent record of the rares that are implemented into the game through donations, there can’t be any confusion about how many rares are in-game, how many colors, and we also show the donator’s in-game name unless they request to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Every rare that is able to be donated for (masks and party hats) are priced identically.  Also, the fact that we stand firm on our donation price of $39.50 (instead of just taking as many lower offers as we can get) is a good indication that we aren’t simply trying to sell as many pixels as possible.</p>
<p>Countless players have asked to buy (for USD) blood runes, dragon meds n sqs, god staffs/capes, points, or just flats.  However, they have all been turned down.  To any reasonable/rational person, this shows we are running this server to make an enjoyable game/community and not for the $$$.  Enough thread derailing, iBoss.  However, I forgive you for being misinformed.  I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you weren’t intentionally trying to slander CirnoPK with a lot of your posts.</p>
<p>Feel free to hop on CirnoPK and you, too, can personally experience our stable economy (as opposed to the other ridiculously inflated servers)</p>
<p>This will be the last time I bother addressing baseless accusations in this official advertising thread for CirnoPK.  If you feel like making claims, fine, but if you expect a response or for anyone to take you seriously, post PROOF.  Oh wait, that’s impossible seeing as your accusations are frivolous.  It’s probably time you just deleted all of your posts and your account (if possible) on Moparscape in order to avoid further embarrassment/ridicule.</p>
<p>Now, lets get back to discussing the real issue here, CirnoPK.  We had <span class="bbcode-b">16 players</span>  online simultaneously earlier this morning.  Our player count, after dipping for a bit, is beginning to steadily climb back up over the last week or so, at least.  I’ve also got an advertising strategy mapped out.  Additionally, I’ve kick started CirnoPK’s advertising budget with $50 of my own personal money.  100% of the proceeds from the next donation item (mask or p hat) will be added to the advertising budget (currently at $50).  After we’ve raised at least $100 to spend on advertising, we will no longer put 100% of the money from a donation item into our advertising budget.  Instead, a fraction of the donation will go toward advertising while the rest sits in savings to ensure we always have enough cash on hand to pay for our (somewhat pricey) dedicated server, DDoS mitigation service, and any other unanticipated expenses.[/quote]</p>

              <p>no lol ive played for like 14 years i think haha, and this server has a great community it really does pking and clan wars theres always great competition just lacks a big amount of player at the moment because of lack of advertising but not hopefully this is what is going to set it off, if you want a pking server this truly is a server to join</p>
