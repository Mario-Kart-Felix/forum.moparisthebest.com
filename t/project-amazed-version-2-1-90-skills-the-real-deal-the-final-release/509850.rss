It’s more of the fact that you have the mentality that people in the workforce can do whatever they want and that because they work for a Java gaming company (That, by the way, boasts 10x more failures in gaming than profits).  Chances are they’re under a strict contact (as most developers of big companies are) and if they did something like this (develop an illegal server), they would more than likely be fired and suing for half the shit they own, this is made even more prevalent in the fact that they’ve spend their time and money getting servers taken down.</p>
<p>And for your other cousin (who would actually work for Oracle, not Java), he would more than likely shriek at how shitty the code is.  We’re not talking of some big business, we’re talking some shitty servers made by teenagers and basically them copy+pasting servers and snippets.  Very few people in this community or in the other communities actually make a difference in servers today, witch is why you never see all these great frameworks being used, they’d rather download a PI server, slap a name on it, and put it up.[/quote]</p>
<p>True story.</p>
<p>@ Carlos- If you ask me, your life is a joke. I saw your ‘Project Amazed’ development threads. You called your cousin Carlos in the chat box. Let alone, you’re talking to yourself in the chat box. Here’s the images: <img src="http://i47.tinypic.com/2053ymb.jpg" alt width="639" height="429"></p>
<p><img src="http://i48.tinypic.com/2rgosgg.jpg" alt width="639" height="429"></p>
<p>The thread: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,628541.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,628541.0.html</a></p>
<p>And when you mentioned us about believing you about your life- it’s not that we don’t believe you. It’s just that we’re not gullible. At least I’m not.</p>
<p>Oh and one last thing- if you’re going to lie, at least do it right.</p>
