<p>I have a fiance</p>

<p>Good work. I don’t even have a girlfriend; the one girl that I did/still do kinda like has me in her friend zone… Why did I ever get to know her as a friend first - biggest mistake ever. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowning1bce.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
[/quote]<br>
I didn’t ask out any girls and I became to popular and everyone was my friend =/ I could get a Girl Friend but, its nice being single. Don’t waste 30mins of your life on the phone saying ‘I love you more…No I love you more…’ unless she makes out with you everyday I see why you would want too.</p>
<p>Tbh, I had thoughts of commiting suicide for a while because I realised were all going to die, so I set some goals and it became good. I try learning more program languages, not C++, python, java, etc,., but web languages like Php &amp; MySql. Next is javascript. After that Ajax. Then pearl. That will be good for college.</p>
<p>Also, try to calm down online racism…Black people ARE people, even though it may be funny, but most blacks have a tough childhood while us white guys have a rich life. I personally hate Mexicans because they cross OUR borders illegaly and expect us to pay for there child’s school, and other programs. When you don’t have a social security number, you get FREE healthcare, by law its illegal to kick someone out of a hospital that need medical help.[/quote]</p>

<p>Brilliant yes, but it’s pointless too! Do you think animals would be sad if humans didn’t exist? I doubt it. What has the human race done to the earth? I doubt anything positive.</p>
<p>For those who are Christian, I always wonder why ‘god’, if he really exists, made the earth in the first place. If we all go to heaven, why don’t we just start our lives there?</p>

<p>Why are you talking about animals being sad? and i don’t care if its pointless as long as its fun. Although i  do respect what your saying.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Just as an example.</p>
<p>Something pointless has no goal. So something pointless has no purpose. Say you have an ant farm. You decide to throw some ant poison into the ant farm. It’s pointless, but ‘fun’. So, having those ants in the first place was pointless. All you did was ruin the ants and their environment.</p>
<p>The same is with life. It’s fun, but there is no goal. You life until you die.</p>
<p>(My metaphor, if you want to call it one, isn’t great and too short. I’m busy with something for school that should’ve been finished 5 hours ago.)</p>
<p>Edit: To Ryequis_: I don’t think anyone here is thinking about killing himself. We are discussing the point of life.</p>

Like how not to be a bum.</p>
<p>When you get to 6th form…teachers no longer suck.<br>
They’re pure fun who get drunk and will have a fag with you at the Christmas ball! Lessons are a complete laugh and you respect the amount of work they actually put in for you.<br>
And if you go clubbing up town, you regularly see them in there having fun.</p>
<p>And i still learn loads from them.</p>
<p>Bare in mind(especially at my school) teachers are still quite young, they are doing their job by being strict stuck up ass holes…a lot of them aren’t actually like that.</p>

        <p>First of all, we live in a society that encourages this kind of living. We are trained since a young age to respect authority unquestioningly, get up in the morning to do work/school, spend your free time doing activities that require minimal use of the brain (Watching TV, playing games, other “passtimes”) at a certain point, our parents kick us out, we get a job, get married, have kids, and then live for another 40/50 years until death.</p>
<p>This is not a comforting thought.</p>
<p>Second, we have a great awareness problem. We are not aware of ourselves, the world around us, or many of the interactions between these. You (Squigglyo) are a great example of this. The world is such an unbelievably large place - it is quite stunning when you begin to realize how large it is - that the very concept of there existing nothing in the world that interests you is just absurd. However, society (And human nature, of which society is a larger manifestation) is at fault again here, too. We tend to look at what we want to see, and anything else falls by the wayside. After awhile, all you can see is a small set of things. If there is something wrong that you are trying to fix, and it is not one of the small set of things you know about, you will die before you ever fix it. (Have you ever had a problem you’ve been wrestling with for weeks, only to have someone come and fix it in 5 minutes by changing something that never came close to entering your mind?) You might think it’s impractical to pay attention to everything around us at once, and that we should focus on only that which is important. However, everything around us interacts in such magnificently complex ways, that if you miss just a single piece of the picture, you will miss the whole thing. Basically, keep an open mind.<br>
This awareness thing extends inward as well. By this, I mean that we do not have an awareness of our own body. Tell me, anyone, do you know what shape your spine is in right now? You should be able to tell without having to look or feel it, via kinesthesia - a sense that tells us the positions of our various parts relative to eachother. If you slouch back into your seat so that your spine forms nearly into the shape of a C, then you are preparing yourself for painful back problems in a few decades or so.<br>
But who, these days, pays attention to the shape of their spine ?! If you do that, you might miss what’s on television, or your MMORPG! Or you could look at your hands, which you no doubt use every day, and depend on more than you can imagine. Straighten out and then curl your fingers repeatedly. Are you aware of the muscles in your forearm, connected by tendons to your fingertips, that are working to move them? Would you notice this if you developed RSI from typing poorly? (Read some accounts from people who’ve gotten RSI from typing, it’s an amazing thought that they have it because they didn’t apply basic knowlege of their own hands/arms)</p>
<p>Life is only meaningless (And thus depressing) if you have nothing to do. So you should do something; you have to set a goal for yourself. There are a few crucial aspects to choosing a goal - for one, a goal has to be very precise - “I want to be the most awesome person alive” is not a precise goal. Depending on how you view “most awesome person alive”, you could work forever without knowing whether you are progressing. “I want to jog 2 miles” is better - either you’ve jogged 2 miles or not, and at any point, you know how many more miles you need to jog after you’ve started.<br>
Secondly, a goal must be within your reach. This is tough, because you never know what is and what is not within your reach. If you are a poor black kid, saying “I want to be the president of the US” may be aiming a tad too high. Then again, you never know, and if you’re feeling lucky, there is nothing you think you can’t do.<br>
Finally (For now), your goal must be something you want. The more you want it, the better. People (Including authorities, loved ones, and yourself) may tell you your goal is crazy, and you have no chance (See “Choosing a goal, above”). If you truly desire your goal, you will have the wisdom to ignore them (Prerequisite to this is knowing whether or not your goal actually IS achievable). However, after all of this, you never achieve your goal, then you’ll probably be more depressed than before. So I will outline the general plan I’ve discovered/read about/concocted for achieving this unspecified goal.</p>
<p>[ul][li]Have a plan of action. A plan is necessary before starting, thought you are free to alter it at any point.[/li]<br>
[li]Use the goal as your center and measuring point: If it is precise, you should be able to easily answer the question “Am I closer to the goal than I was yesterday?”[/li]<br>
[li]Be able to discern whether or not your plan is working - regardless of authority, loved ones, your own intuition, etc. If the whole universe is telling you that you must use plan X, and you are using it but not approaching the goal, you give it up in search for one that works. For example, the fatso who has decided he’s finally going on a diet (+exercise, other healthy stuff, the works). At first it’s hard work, but he’s losing weight. After a few years, however, he is barely losing anything. But since he is being told constantly by commercials, society, his own intuition, that dieting is the answer, he never thinks to try a different course of action. Eventually he gives up, goes back to his old habits, and regains all the lost weight (And then some). [Btw, some fat friends of mine have seen this happen to their fat friends, I’ve not made it up][/li]<br>
[li]Do not underthink things - if you do you’re a fool. Do not overthink to the point you cannot decide what to do anymore either.[/li]<br>
[li]Be willing to try a new plan if you think it will work better. But don’t give up something that’s working consistently just because there is something newer and more modern on the market.[/li]<br>
[li]Be open to incredibly radical stuff; everything is interrelated you know.[/li]<br>
[li]Pie is good[/li]<br>
[li]Keep a log of all your activities and results, all your epiphanies, etc. They might come in handy later (And we tend to forget this stuff)[/li][/ul]</p>
<pre><code>        And finally:
</code></pre>
<p>[ul][li]Never give up the curiosity we are born with, when you do, you might as well just return to living pointlessly until you die.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Hope this gets you back on the right track.</p>

This is because my life is boring and always the same routine.(go to school, go home, study, school,…)<br>

Other kids my age seem perfectly fine, they enjoy life and they’re usually happy.<br>

<p>Couldn’t agree more.<br>
People nowadays confuse intelligence with knowledge, wich are in my opinion 2 completely different things.</p>
<p>[quote=“exe626, post:45, topic:245089”]I’m have no future. I have a bad criminal record and I’m dropping out of high school. I’ve been living in poverty my entire life. I was going to go to an art school, but they called me today and told me, that with the amount of money I make, I wont be able to attend. I go on the computer to escape all of that. I have friends here, lots of them. They make life easier in this virtual world.</p>
<p>Someday, I hope to get married. Have a kid or 2. That’d make me the happiest man alive. Yet, here you are, downing the idea as if it’s something bad? I met the most perfect girl, and someday, things might happen. She’s turned my life around. A month ago, I was ready to drive off into a lake, but here I am today, all because of her.</p>
<p>Maybe you just need a woman?[/quote]<br>
You see,you’re already wrong on your first sentence.<br>
“I have no future.” Why? Because you dropped out of high school?<br>
Plenty of people made it big in their life without even getting education.<br>
When you say “i have no future” you are actualy limiting yourself.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>no, your problem is that the big picture you think you’re looking at is so pathetically small that you have this great new contorted way of looking at life. if you think you’re going to do something important enough to affect the entire universe, go ahead and get ready to be disappointed. even if anyone were important enough to have that effect, i doubt it would be you, seeing as you don’t even have enough motivation to follow through with some of your money-making ideas.</p>
<p>and i don’t really understand your thought process - you ask what the point is of living for 90 years if you’re just going to end up dying? what the hell do you want? do you want to live forever so you have more time to do something great? and how do you even define “great”? something people will remember you by? do you think albert einstein cares that people still study his work, or thomas edison cares that the entire world uses light bulbs because he invented them? obviously not, they’re dead. either you don’t understand this concept, or you want to be able to look back at something you did and take satisfaction in the fact that it affected a large number of people. i’m assuming you’re not an idiot, and that it’s the latter, which brings us back to the pursuit of happiness, what so many have already said. obviously you’re a bit questionable on what makes you happy, seeing as you have a fiance and still think your life seems pointless, which would imply that you should do some exploring. maybe you’ll find something that makes you happy, and maybe you won’t. but at the very least you’ll make your life less dull by stirring it up with new things.[/quote]<br>
Here it is, a perfect example of an ignorant person.(not trying to offend you or something <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )<br>
“…go ahead and get ready to be disappointed” Now thats the type of mentality most unsuccessful people have.<br>
If you don’t even bother trying something, then how will you know you would fail?<br>
Did Thomas Edison have the same mentality as you do?<br>
It’s like people are brainwashed into believing that they should live a meaningless life and earn 2000 a month while spending their free time in front of the television.</p>
<p>That’s the problem, most people quit before they even start, because they’re already thinking of a more “realistic” life.</p>
<p>Oh and, nice forum by the way  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

        <p>Well, for starters, I didn’t drop out of school. I was kicked out. I’ve been kicked out so many times that, this time, they made it forever. They weren’t going to do until I was 18, but my mom is a bitch and hates me anyways, so she signed the form for me to be kicked out. When I was younger, I damaged more than $150,000 in property. I have 30~ assault counts. I’ve been arrested 3 times for “gang-related activity”. Arrested multiple times for general fighting. I went to juvy when I was 13, got out when I was 14. I’ve stolen more property than most of you own, which I had to do community service to pay for, then give them the items and money back. I was just arrested recently while driving because, evidently, going 5 mph under the speed limit is against the law, which got my license taken away. Now I can’t drive. I didn’t have the money to, anyways.</p>
<p>There’s more, I can’t remember everything.</p>
