    <title>Life is depressingly pointless yes?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/life-is-depressingly-pointless-yes/245089</link>
    <description>Every now and then something cracks inside my brain and i get hit by the severe want to actually achieve something worthwhile in my life. Something out of the ordinary. 


Which is quickly followed by the crushing realization that life isnt fair, and I, along with virtually anyone else i can possibly know, is going to die without achieving anything other than getting a soul crushing job, marrying a no doubt soul crushing woman and raising several soul crushing kids so that they can grow up to lead boring soul crushing existences.


I would sooner shoot myself in the head than live a life that is the same every week, and mimics 99% of everyone elses life.




I used to play Runescape to idle my time away, since it made me feel like i was achieving something. After that started to suck, i moved onto World of Warcraft. 

Ive evolved beyond the want to play games to waste away my time, and now need to achieve something... or at least give my meaningless existence something thatl make it stand out against everyone else.

If i take a step back and look, i know for a fact i have several ideas that could catapult me into more money than i could possibly spend in 7 life times. But thats just it... im an ideas man. I couldnt possibly create any of the things i come up with, i either need programmers, money or people. All of which are always out of reach. 



So... what do you people do to take away the drudgery of your pointless lives? 
Also... any suggestions as to what i could possibly aim for that is worth while, dont hesitate to advise.</description>

<p>It’s quite obvious that fighting the failures in your life in way thats against the law will make your situation even worse.</p>
<p>Of course it sucks for you that you are in this situation, but it’s mainly your own fault.</p>

exe626, it may sound cliché , but if you really believe in yourself you can achieve something.<br>

<p>Forget about your failures. Let it go; it’s in the past and you can’t change it (Unless you hack into yuor cirminal reocrds and edit them ??? ) And I’m sure plenty of people will be there to remind you about it.</p>
<p>Consider the following: There are 2 kinds of people in this world, those who live just to get by, and those who live to do something. The ones who live just to get by spend alot of their free time doing nothing, and won’t act until their lifestyle is threatened. You can find them everywhere (Moparscape is a good place to look). The ones who live to do something are nearly always, well, doing something. Which are you ?</p>

<p>Well Ohio isn’t very far at all. It probably would cost less than $100 for a bus trip.<br>
Of course you would want to line up some employment and get an apartment. If you come to the Niagara region we could hang out.</p>

              <p>exe626, it may sound cliché , but if you really believe in yourself you can achieve something.</p>
<p>I think you should get an undeclared work(i dont know if thats the right word).<br>
Like those chinese restaurants, they hire people with a criminal past, immigrants,… you know what i mean.<br>
You could make some money without stealing and when you have enough, then go to canada just like you wanted.<br>
There’s always a way out, there are so many possibilities but you refuse to get ideas because you’re stuck with the thought that says you’re a failure.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>no, your problem is that the big picture you think you’re looking at is so pathetically small that you have this great new contorted way of looking at life. if you think you’re going to do something important enough to affect the entire universe, go ahead and get ready to be disappointed. even if anyone were important enough to have that effect, i doubt it would be you, seeing as you don’t even have enough motivation to follow through with some of your money-making ideas.</p>
<p>and i don’t really understand your thought process - you ask what the point is of living for 90 years if you’re just going to end up dying? what the hell do you want? do you want to live forever so you have more time to do something great? and how do you even define “great”? something people will remember you by? do you think albert einstein cares that people still study his work, or thomas edison cares that the entire world uses light bulbs because he invented them? obviously not, they’re dead. either you don’t understand this concept, or you want to be able to look back at something you did and take satisfaction in the fact that it affected a large number of people. i’m assuming you’re not an idiot, and that it’s the latter, which brings us back to the pursuit of happiness, what so many have already said. obviously you’re a bit questionable on what makes you happy, seeing as you have a fiance and still think your life seems pointless, which would imply that you should do some exploring. maybe you’ll find something that makes you happy, and maybe you won’t. but at the very least you’ll make your life less dull by stirring it up with new things.[/quote]<br>
Here it is, a perfect example of an ignorant person.(not trying to offend you or something <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )<br>
“…go ahead and get ready to be disappointed” Now thats the type of mentality most unsuccessful people have.<br>
If you don’t even bother trying something, then how will you know you would fail?<br>
Did Thomas Edison have the same mentality as you do?<br>
It’s like people are brainwashed into believing that they should live a meaningless life and earn 2000 a month while spending their free time in front of the television.</p>
<p>That’s the problem, most people quit before they even start, because they’re already thinking of a more “realistic” life.</p>
