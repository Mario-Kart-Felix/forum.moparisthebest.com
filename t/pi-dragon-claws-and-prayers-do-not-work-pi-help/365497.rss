    <title>[PI]Dragon claws and prayers do not work[PI][HELP]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-dragon-claws-and-prayers-do-not-work-pi-help/365497</link>
    <description>Since a week i&#39;ve been figuring out how PI works, I already figured out most things.

But there are a few things which I couldnt fix; Prayers and Dragon claws.

Prayers do not work, NONE! protect doesnt work, ancient curses do not work, protect item does WORK.
Any solution on this? I&#39;ve been checking out NPCHandler.java for a while, prayer.java etc. No succes.

And my other problem is; Dragon claws. The PI client doesnt seem to have the emote + GFX for the dragon claws, the model of the claws works.
I&#39;ve added special, I can see the bar but when I click on it while attacking a NPC it does nothing.

Help please?</description>
