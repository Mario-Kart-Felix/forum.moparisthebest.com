    <title>Screen Resolution not supported</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/screen-resolution-not-supported/342367</link>
    <description>So I bought a new video card for my desktop and it took me like 2 hours to setup the drivers on xp. Eventually I got it, I then start up ubuntu and install the driver which took ~ 1 minute. I had to restart for the changes to take effect, but when I restarted (I&#39;m guessing that installing the driver changed the resolution for me) the resolution/refresh rate was not supported by my monitor.

tltr: How can I change my resolution/refresh rate without actually being able to see anything on my monitor as the current resolution isn&#39;t supported by my monitor?

Edit: I just found out that it isn&#39;t a resolution/refresh rate problem. After installing the ati driver and restarting, the screen goes blank. It&#39;s not the resolution because I also tried a more capable monitor. I also searched around and found out that other people were having the same issue. There was some stuff about repairing xorg.config but it didn&#39;t work for me.</description>

              <p>I downloaded the catalyst driver but upon restarting the whole screen went purple. I think if I were to play with the driver in graphics failsafe mode I could have fixed it. But as for now I’m abandoning linux until after I finish my exams, it’s taking too much of my time.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help admins &amp; weible.</p>
<p>And btw, I did find a way to stretch my monitor using the monitor. I also found out that screen is also over-sized in windows when I play a certain game at 1280*1024, so I’m guessing the problem was indeed the graphics card rather than the Linux driver.</p>

I can adjust the position of the display using the monitor, but I can’t find anything to reduce it’s size. Even after adjusting the position, some of the desktop is still beyond what my monitor can display.</p>

<p>My attempt at repairing it was using a command (I can’t remember what it was exactly) I found on the ubuntu forums which I pasted into the terminal. Is there any other way I can go about ‘repairing’ xorg.conf?</p>
<p>A lot of people are having a similar problem. <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1307653" rel="nofollow noopener">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1307653</a></p>
<p>That particular one is for people with nVidia cards but I have come across many instances with the same problem on an ATi card.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
I rebooted, selected recovery option in the boot menu. I then when into low graphic mode failsafe. I got it to restore original generic settings and rebooted again. For some reason it worked and the proprietary driver is enabled. Don’t ask me why :S</p>
<p>New problem: the current resolution 1360*768 is too big for my screen which is funny because this resolution was fine on windows.</p>

              <p>The file you need to change is /etc/X11/xorg.conf, not xorg.config so that might be the problem right there?</p>

              <p>So I bought a new video card for my desktop and it took me like 2 hours to setup the drivers on xp. Eventually I got it, I then start up ubuntu and install the driver which took ~ 1 minute. I had to restart for the changes to take effect, but when I restarted (I’m guessing that installing the driver changed the resolution for me) the resolution/refresh rate was not supported by my monitor.</p>
<p>tltr: How can I change my resolution/refresh rate without actually being able to see anything on my monitor as the current resolution isn’t supported by my monitor?</p>
<p>Edit: I just found out that it isn’t a resolution/refresh rate problem. After installing the ati driver and restarting, the screen goes blank. It’s not the resolution because I also tried a more capable monitor. I also searched around and found out that other people were having the same issue. There was some stuff about repairing xorg.config but it didn’t work for me.</p>
