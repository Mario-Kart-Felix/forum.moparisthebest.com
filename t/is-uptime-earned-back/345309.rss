<p>no it will never go back to 100% but it will never go to 0% use some math… if its been off for 1 minute you cant have it on 100% right? so you answer is no, but you could always keep it at 99% or if your at 1% you can get it back to 99% but not 100%</p>

<p>That’s not what others seem to be saying when I do research.<br>
I understand your math but others aren’t saying that. Anyone else?</p>
