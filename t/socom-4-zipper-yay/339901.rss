    <description>So after the near complete failure of Confrontation, and now that MAG is done with whats next for Zipper? SOCOM roots mutha[bleep]er!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xffHGUIwL4 [Sony&#39;s &quot;stick&quot;]

SOCOM 4 at the moment didn&#39;t bring me any sudden &quot;OH MY GAWD&quot;  moment. (Watch Ubisoft&#39;s Ghost Recon Future Soldier Live Trailer for that omg moment.) But hey! Its SOCOM. I have MAG and Bad Company 2 to keep me occupied with shooters at the moment, but something feels missing inside of me. That Counter-Strike feel where you die and you wait till the round is over. Thats actually the best part in Confrontation imo. Since games like MAG and BC2 allow you to kinda run and gun with not as much consequences since you respawn in the same game oppose to a round respawn game. 

So what are your thoughts on this game?</description>
