    <title>Trouble with an integer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trouble-with-an-integer/288664</link>
    <description>I recently added a new integer on my server. 
[code]public int moneycape = 0;[/code]
Everything turned out find, there were no errors and when I opened my moreinfo file it said 
[code] character-moneycape = 0 [/code]
like it was supposed to.

However, when I went to make the command things didn&#39;t go so smooth.
Here&#39;s the command I used.

[code] 	if 

(command.startsWith(&quot;buymoneycape&quot;)) {
		if 

(!playerHasItemAmount(995, 2147000000)) {
			

sendMessage(&quot;You need 2147M to make a 

payment!&quot;);
			return;
		}
		deleteItem(995, 

getItemSlot(995), 2147000000);
		if (moneycape == 1)
			

sendMessage(&quot;You have paid your second 

payment!&quot;);

			moneycape = 2;
		if 

(!playerHasItemAmount(995, 2147000000)) {
			

sendMessage(&quot;You need 2147M to make a 

payment!&quot;);
			return;
		}
		deleteItem(995, 

getItemSlot(995), 2147000000);
		if (moneycape == 2)
			

sendMessage(&quot;You have paid your third 

payment!&quot;);

			moneycape = 3;
		if 

(!playerHasItemAmount(995, 2147000000)) {
			

sendMessage(&quot;You need 2147M to make a 

payment!&quot;);
			return;
		}
		deleteItem(995, 

getItemSlot(995), 2147000000);
		if (moneycape == 3)
			

sendMessage(&quot;You have paid your fourth payment! 

Only 1 left!&quot;);

			moneycape = 4;
		if 

(!playerHasItemAmount(995, 2147000000)) {
			

sendMessage(&quot;You need 2147M to make a 

payment!&quot;);
			return;
		}
		deleteItem(995, 

getItemSlot(995), 2147000000);
		if (moneycape == 4) {
			

sendMessage(&quot;You have paid your last payment! 

Enjoy your rare Money Cape!&quot;);
			addItem(15189, 

1);
			moneycape = 0;
		} else {
			

sendMessage(&quot;You have paid your first payment!&quot;);
			moneycape = 1;
		}
		savemoreinfo();
	} [/code]

I didn&#39;t get any errors or anything, but in game when I did ::buymoneycape WITH 2147M in my invintory, it sent the message &quot;You need 2147M to make a payment&quot; and took the money. Then I logged and looked to see if it had changed to 
[code] character-moneycape = 1 [/code]
but it didn&#39;t. It stayed at moneycape = 0, Did I do something wrong with my command?</description>

              <p>@'Rich your command looks good. It still doesn’t save though. It was kinda weird in-game. I did ::buymoneycape about 7 times. On like the fourth time it said “You’ve made your second payment”. (It skipped the first?) The rest of the time it said “You need 2147M to make a payment!” and just took the money. When I opened the file it still said character-moneycape = 0.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

Alright I’l try that in a sec, but do you think that would stop it from sending the wrong message?[/quote]<br>
What do you mean? All it does is increase the integer.</p>
<p>just add that under every 		deleteItem(995,</p>
