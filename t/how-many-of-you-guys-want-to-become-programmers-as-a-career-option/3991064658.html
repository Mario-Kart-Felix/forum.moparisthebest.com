<p>Uhh, that’s not entirely correct. Depends who you work for, your field and what you are doing exactly.</p>
<p>For example, if you consider creating your own indie video game company (I would consider it “professional” if it’s your main source of income) you can work where you want, when you want and on what you want. Although you do have to manage everything yourself which can take up lots of time.</p>
<p>Or as a freelancing Web Designer/Developer. You can work on your contracts at your house on the hours you want and you can make quite a lot.</p>
<p>Those are just a couple I can think of off the top of my head, but you were right about being unappreciated. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>C++ and Java are the 2 big languages right now, at least from what I’ve seen on job requirements. The more languages you know, the more they want you though.</p>

<p>Truth is programming is only really profitable if you do it illegally and hack creditcards (that’s a no no) or if you can get an army of people willing to blindly buy what ever you want for 3000% what you paid to make it (Mr Jobs you sneeky bastard) so for me its just something fun to do that makes a little money without too much work. Also I’m currently taking collage classes for a criminal justice degree (damn you criminal minds cast, you turned me into you) so its nice knowing how to take down your teachers computer system when you didn’t study. Along with that the voice in my head tells me to do it so yeah.</p>

<p>Not entirely. My friends dad does programming for the FAA, he builds/implants the OS that runs on the Air Traffic Control computers. He has a government contract and he makes big bucks plus the economy can’t destroy it because he has a contract.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Still, when that contact runs out in like 10 or 20 years it will be hard to get that much money again. Basic thing is the majority of coders don’t make that much.</p>

<p>He has his own company, and he’s been doing it for a while and the contract runs out in 30 years.<br>

He didn’t say everybody anyways. Programming an air-traffic control OS is like making a pinch-weld on a space-shuttle for NASA. One thing wrong and disaster happens. Your dad will make great money, yes, while he is on the job. Yet, when it finishes, he <span class="bbcode-b">may</span> not be able to get the same income.[/quote]<br>
Not my father, my close friends father.</p>

That’s a lot compared to any job… EVER; CS makes more starting than most engineering degrees. Only things that will make more are bio-engineering and petrol-engineering.</p>
