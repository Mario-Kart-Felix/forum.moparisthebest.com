    <description>I&#39;m assuming most of the people don&#39;t really have a apprenticeship in their main dream job in life, but if you do.. I suppose posting it will be okay, if it&#39;s slightly related to the title. As for me; I&#39;m currently doing tafe courses in programming, and would love a career one day in this field.</description>

I forget a lot of what I read in programming… Honestly… I read a whole 400 page book and will only remember like 50% of the book… but I won’t give up just because of that.<br>

Don’t worry about it, no programmer memorizes everything, that is what docs are for.  What you want to learn is how to program, some algorithms you need, how things work at high and low levels, and different types of programming languages (for different types, look at prolog, lisp, java, Haskell, C etc).  Actual languages and syntax doesn’t matter at all, once you learn to think like a programmer, you can learn about any new or different language in no time.</p>

Huge difference, one focuses on design structures and production whilst the other focuses on theory and efficiency.</p>

Still, when that contact runs out in like 10 or 20 years it will be hard to get that much money again. Basic thing is the majority of coders don’t make that much.[/quote]<br>
He has his own company, and he’s been doing it for a while and the contract runs out in 30 years.</p>

Truth is programming is only really profitable if you do it illegally and hack creditcards (that’s a no no) or if you can get an army of people willing to blindly buy what ever you want for 3000% what you paid to make it (Mr Jobs you sneeky bastard) so for me its just something fun to do that makes a little money without too much work. Also I’m currently taking collage classes for a criminal justice degree (damn you criminal minds cast, you turned me into you) so its nice knowing how to take down your teachers computer system when you didn’t study. Along with that the voice in my head tells me to do it so yeah.<br>

Not entirely. My friends dad does programming for the FAA, he builds/implants the OS that runs on the Air Traffic Control computers. He has a government contract and he makes big bucks plus the economy can’t destroy it because he has a contract.[/quote]<br>
