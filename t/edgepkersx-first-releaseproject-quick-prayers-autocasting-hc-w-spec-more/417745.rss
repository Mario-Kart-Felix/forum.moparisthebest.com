    <description>[center]EDIT : working on EdgePKersX V2, gonna make multi cannon,fix some bugs, make summoning 100% or close to it, add specs for more summonings like steel titan, etc.

Source download: 

Alright well ive had this server for a while (atleast the source) (tbh i switch clients every couple weeks xD) and i really havent done anything with it like putting it online or releasing, so just decided to release it &gt;.&gt;

The source is hybrid pvp v3 which is why i suggest you just take some features and put it on a stable source, but ive never had any memleak probs or anything but just to be safe

The client is insidiax so i give 99% credits to insidiaX for the client(which is why i havent deleted the names or anything from client) and 1% creds to me for adding some things to it

Some of the features are listed in a txt file that comes with the source along with some notes

for people who cba trying to find features ive added:
NOTE: THIS IS DSPK SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST TAKE SOME FEATURES AND PUT IT ON A STABLE SOURCE
but tbh ive never had a memleak problem or anything of that nature, but just better to be safe

- ring of kinship - id 15707
- quick prayers fully working server sided and working like 80% client sided, just need to fix
  checks when clicked and 2 augury pray orbs arent supposed to be there cause i dont have those prays
- right clicking autocast (autocasting without a staff)
- changed home to the dwarf place cause for some reason i lagged at edge with this client
- added korasi anims/gfx, and server sided spec hit withs mage (cba doing multi hit)
- added like 50 tuts/snippets, including sailing, achievement system, clue scrolls, gnome gliders, POS, etc.
- made 2 holliday quests, a christmas one and a hween one
- fixed some things with summoning, also made some specs for like 3-4 fams
- some custom interfaces
- hand cannon special
- got rid of some unneeded folders
- idk why but combat is kind of better than what i started out with even thou i barely touched cb class
- all emotes work with correct anims and no weapon when doing anim
- mage actually hits according to your lvl now
- all curses and prayers work (excluding summoning with other headprayers)
- was working on all lunar spells, but got bored and stopped after i finished heal other and energy transfer xD
- combat icons, critical hits, fading, etc, full credits to InsidiaX for client
- new friends tab
- source comes with a server manager (located in /Data/ folder), you can look for any items on the server, 
  check ranks, and theres an eco trimmer
- working deflects on players and npcs and working berserker effect ( like i said all curses work)
- bosses hit through prayer, but not as often/hard
- basic combat bugs fixed, pray being drained when no one used ss or smite, double range hit, etc
- drops are loaded through config class
- all stackables and notes - thanks k4rn4ge :DD
- made logs for pms, trade, suggestions, reports
- added a snippet for only 2 starters per ip
- added summon special amount
- average engine load / player = .17%

<p>If you ever used the actual source from R-S, you would know it’s far better than Insidiax.<br>
It’s a Hybrid PvP V3 source and InsidiaX client, since he decided he would never use it, he never edited the client.</p>

<p>Source download:</p>
<p>Alright well ive had this server for a while (atleast the source) (tbh i switch clients every couple weeks xD) and i really havent done anything with it like putting it online or releasing, so just decided to release it &gt;.&gt;</p>
<p>The source is hybrid pvp v3 which is why i suggest you just take some features and put it on a stable source, but ive never had any memleak probs or anything but just to be safe</p>
<p>The client is insidiax so i give 99% credits to insidiaX for the client(which is why i havent deleted the names or anything from client) and 1% creds to me for adding some things to it</p>
<p>Some of the features are listed in a txt file that comes with the source along with some notes</p>
<p>for people who cba trying to find features ive added:<br>
