    <description>It has come to my attention that when the admins are offline, PvP at the spawn city has become popular. This is a formal warning to everyone that PvP at the main spawn city (within the walls) is strictly prohibited. Lumbridge is to help new players get started, as well as support the current players if they are in need of assistance. 

Any PvP inside the walls will result in at least a one day ban.</description>

You can’t really “force” them out, you just don’t allow them to build their own house. So if they want to actually make their own place and play the game they have to be outside the safe zone.</p>

<p>I don’t understand why people would think killing at spawn would be acceptable anyway. Once a city formed, people probably thought it would be the same concept as raiding it.</p>

<p>And whoever suggested the VIP’s become mods - It’s probably not going to happen. The difference between VIP and Mod is similar to the difference between senior member and moderator on the forums: big.</p>
<p>But I do agree we need more staff. Strike (StrikeMC on the forums) has been made moderator. He’s been very helpful, trustworthy, and reports players to me often.  He’s also over 12 years old :rolleyes: (by 9 years, in fact :P)</p>
