              <p>[quote=“DarienM, post:4, topic:354538”]well try and get some of your friends on it, and vote everyday, if you can get like 2 votes in throughout a whole day, and you have like 6 friends on the server, who all vote, you can get like 100 votes throughout, a week, which will attract many people.</p>
<p>Also for when you do that, try and make an attractive banner, and try and say all the positive’s that other servers may not have, like ‘working godwars’, or something along those lines[/quote]<br>
My friends = too lazy to vote, I tried going on major chatboxes to tell ppl to vote for my server lol.</p>

<p>Well, I tried that, but I don’t have enough players voting for my server… And players complain that there aren’t more players on my server and they end up quitting because of the population… =/</p>
