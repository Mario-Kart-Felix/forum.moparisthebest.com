    <title>Advanced AutoTyper</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/advanced-autotyper/48668</link>
    <description>This is a sweet auto typer I wrote in C#. Anyone who has knowledge of SCAR and C# could easily convert this into SCAR. I created it for my RuneClickster program I was making. That eventually died out so I decided to release this almost finished code. As of now, the only mistake it correctly makes (haha) is pressing the wrong letter. Try to fix that up as I am much too lazy to do it myself.

FEATURES:
You can control the chance of it making mistake and you can also control whether it will notice / care about mistakes it has made
Mistakes are custom build for standard U.S. keyboards so the bot will accidentally press keys near the key it was supposed to press
Fine tuning of speed allows you to control exactly how fast you want it to go
It&#39;s open source! Fix any problems you find! Customize it any way you want!
Perfect for auto-sellers! Many humans makes mistakes and completly ignore them! Make you bot do the same!

WHAT THIS SHOULD&#39;NT BE USED FOR
Auto logging in!! (unless you change it to either make no mistakes or so it will correct every mistake it makes)
Autoing on mains (this is almost completely untested!!!)

Viruses? Keyloggers? Trojans!?!?
Nope. None. Don&#39;t believe me? Download the source and compile it yourself. Don&#39;t have a compiler? Have somebody else compile it for you. Paranoid and you don&#39;t trust them? THEN PRESS BACK!!!!!!

Well anyways, I am providing two attachments you can download. The binary DLL and the source code.

If you use my DLL file, PLEASE, give me credit. If you use my idea, PLEASE, give me credit.

Don&#39;t be a nub leecher. Comments (whether negative or positive) are always appreciated.

BUGS:
Not all mistakes work correctly as I said above


IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YOU NEED THE .NET FRAMEWORK 2.0 TO RUN THIS DLL!!! YOU NEED VISUAL STUDIO 2005 TO USE THE SOURCE!!!!!!!!


This a description of each of the arguments of the method:
text = The text to type
speed = How many milliseconds between each letter to wait? 120-125 works great
mistakes = Chances out of 30 that we will make a mistakes (for each letter)
mistakeType = Type of mistakes we will make. Check out the integers declared inside the Keyboard Class (they are static)
minRandomExclamtionMarks = The minimum amount of exclamation marks at the end of a sentence
maxRandomExclamationMarks = The maximum amount of exclamation marks at the end of a sentence
backspace = Chance out of 30 that we will catch our errors, backspace them and then retype them correctly</description>
