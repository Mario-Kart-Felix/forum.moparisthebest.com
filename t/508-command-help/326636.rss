    <title>[508+] Command Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-command-help/326636</link>
    <description>Well, my server has a pk system. it puts kills into ur character when you kill someone. so i want new normals to atleast kill 10 people before they can do ::food command. it has fishing so thats why i want this. will anyone help me.
i added the kills == 10 part and it works. but how can i add it so that it&#39;s 10 and higher not just equals 10.
and the bottom command how can i make it when player do ::food and they have less than 10 kills so they are the only ones get the message when they type ::food.
i need this because i put this for 6 or 7 other commands.
&lt;blockquote&gt;if(cmd[0].equals(&quot;food&quot;) &amp;&amp; p.kills == 10){
			Engine.playerItems.addItem(p, 386, 5000);
			Engine.playerItems.addItem(p, 3024, 1);
                                                p.getActionSender().sendMessage(p, &quot;To get food, You must go to ::fish and fish some food and kill atleast 10 people in PvP.&quot;);
		             }
                                                     if (cmd[0].equals(&quot;food&quot;)) {
p.getActionSender().sendMessage(p, &quot;You need 10 kills to fish some food.!&quot;);
}&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
