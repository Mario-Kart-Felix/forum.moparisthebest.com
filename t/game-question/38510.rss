    <title>Game question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/game-question/38510</link>
    <description>Well, a few years ago I saw this preview of a game. The question is, what game was it? Now you cant tell me  :rolleyes: so Ill describe the game a bit.

OK. The story begins with that the main characters dad got murdered, and the main character wants revenge. In the begining you start at a harbor. Its a chinese/japanese character by the way. What you have to do (from what I saw in the preview) is to fight other people for money. I havent seen the rest of it. 

This is all I can think of right now. Ask anything that you need to know and Ill try to answer.

Thanks in advance.</description>

              <p>Yea I know. I have some more info :P. When you begin, you come to the harbor from a big ship. Also, its not a game you can download like warrock or gunz, but you had to buy it on a cd.</p>
