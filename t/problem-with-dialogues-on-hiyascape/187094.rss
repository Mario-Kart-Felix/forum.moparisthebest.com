    <title>Problem with dialogues on hiyascape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-dialogues-on-hiyascape/187094</link>
    <description>Well if anyone has noticed on project czar, it has quite a few glitchs and hiyascape is czar based. Whenever I spawn an npc or put it in autospawn.cfg, following delta&#39;s &quot;adding npc dialogues&quot;, It fishes lob-manta&#39;s. Everytime I spawn a new npc it does same thing or nothing at all. I think it is the fishing that is blocking dialogues from working yet I deleted the fishing between case 155. It stopped the fishing when you click an npc but I put dialogues to see if the npc can talk. STILL DOESN&#39;T WORK...Anyone know what to do?</description>
