Really, what is happening to this world?

P.S. I actually liked commercials with Billy Mays in them.">

<p>That’s what this society has brought you up to <span class="bbcode-b">think</span>. From that comment, you have already showed your lack of intellect.

<p>Right, 4.0 student, going into junior year of HS at a tough school.  Right, lack of intellect.  And yes, I am crying because I lost someone, your right.  But also, I am Catholic, he is in a better place, so GTFO.<br>

<p>Again, you’ve proved you’re a dick.  No, while I understand he’s in a better place, he’s dead, he’s gone.  Honestly, do you even know how hard it was to get through that week?  Jc, just leave me alone.</p>

<p>I’m not directing this towards any of the posts here. I haven’t read the majority of the posts, and I haven’t read yours. I was only stating that crying is a form of selfishness. He’s dead.

This world is far from wonderful.  And I’m done with you, post what you want, I’m ignoring it.  And I cried for his dad; he lost his only child and wife to some moron who got drunk and decided to drive without a license.  His dad lost part of his life, not me.  Once again, I’m <span class="bbcode-b">done</span> with your damn posts about me being selfish because a friend died.[/quote]</p>
<pre><code> Jc as well as you are selfish. Humans are selfish by nature. It's just how we are programmed. He's not telling you that you're a horrible person for crying. He was simply stating that crying is simply a selfish act because it's not to benefit anyone; it's simply just because you've lost something. Also, he's not being a dick. He's being realistic. 

 A 4.0 in high school is not an achievement by the way. I'm not saying you're mentally retarded. I'm simply stating that High School isn't all that hard. I'm a Sophomore and I'm taking college classes so I can get my associates degree when I graduate. It doesn't mean I'm smart.</code></pre>

<p>Tons of people, including myself, take college courses in high school. It’s not even an achievement, and if you can’t take college courses becuase you’re not ready for them, try to take them… They’re so easy.</p>

        <p>Billy T James died <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Billy T James, (1948  August 07, 1991), born William James Taitoko, was a New Zealand entertainer, comedian and actor. He starred in numerous TV shows and variety programs, performed on stage and in motion pictures. He joined the Maori Volcanics Showband in the 1970s and performed around the world. Going solo in Australia and then New Zealand saw him in great demand for his skits and impressions and his cabaret singing.</p>
<p>He starred with Peter Rowley and Annie Whittle in a series of sketches, and starred in Radio Times, on TV in 1980 and the feature film Came a Hot Friday, directed by Ian Mune in 1985. He was New Zealand Entertainer of the Year in 1981 and Entertainer of the Decade in 1985. He and Chris Slane wrote a comic book in 1986 called Billy T James Real Hard Case, and a second comic book in 1987 called Real Hard Case 2. Billy also provided a voice for the 1986 animated film, Footrot Flats: The Dog’s Tail. He and Tom Parkinson, of Isambard Productions, devised a 1989 sitcom, The Billy T James Show. Starring effectively as himself, James’ co-stars were Ilona Rodgers and Mark Hadlow, with Tania Wehi and Willa O’Neill. The pilot for the series was not broadcast, but was included on Te Video Billy T James and Friends, a VHS compilation of classic James moments released by Isambard Productions. His last television performance was the hour long The Billy T James Show Christmas special in 1990(?).</p>
<p>After his heart transplant in 1988, Billy returned to the stage in 1990, in the variety special Billy T James, Alive and Giggling. Among the special guests was Howard Morrison, another famous Maori entertainer. James’ health deteriorated swiftly following the stage show, and he died from a heart attack on 7 August 1991. He was well known for his yellow towel, black singlet and black shorts seen in skits,Te News and Marae Witness News. He is also known for his famous ‘Maori chuckle’. He said: “If it wasn’t for the Poms you’d all be the same colour as me, mate!”, and “I’m half Scot, half Maori. One half wants to get pissed (drunk) and the other doesn’t want to pay for it”.</p>
