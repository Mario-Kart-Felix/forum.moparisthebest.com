    <title>How to post server on status with Vps</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-post-server-on-status-with-vps/314338</link>
    <description>Hello everybody,
I trying now 2 weeks long to post my server on the Moparscape Server status page.
But it says we need to aprove by login with a username and password to the server, to get it on status page.
I all did. But still not works. Or do we need to login on vps with anyone client with that username and password.

Please help my, Runescape private server coding is my hobby, and i want more then 20+ people that i have now.</description>

              <p>The username and password it gives you to approve your server is the account that will be logged in from the moparscape client to check if the server is online. For this to work, you must not be blocking the moparscape client from connecting to your server.</p>

              <p>I am not sure if this is allowed. But you need to allow the SS to login to your server so it can put you on the SS, if your the owner of the server you should be fine since it checks ip’s also. Well I am not sure what else to say now that I think of it  :P, I don’t use the SS any more.</p>
