    <description>This is being posted due to heavy confusion in the warning department.  Most of you seem to think that you can&#39;t go from a level without a warning, straight to a moderation or mute, but rather they must be warned first.  [b]This is not true.[/b]  We do not know how this thought came about, but the rants saying &quot;I should&#39;ve been warned, not muted, wtf?&quot; need to stop.  Punishments are at the moderator&#39;s discretion, [b]not yours.[/b]

Basically, we can give you whatever punishment we want if we feel its needed.</description>
