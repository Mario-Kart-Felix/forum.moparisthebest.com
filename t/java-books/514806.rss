    <title>Java Books</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-books/514806</link>
    <description>Recently I got more interested in reading the Java Documents and so on, which despise what a lot of people say they do actually hold a lot of information to learn from.

Any how I was wondering what kind of Java books people could recommend me buying and reading? 

Thanks.</description>

              <p>Yes, books are a great way to learn. I have bought around 70 books so far. Most are Java books, but many of them are for other languages aswell. But, in order to recommend any given book, it would be good to know what you wish to learn the most. Is it the basics, architecture and design, GUI development, J2EE, compiler design, program analysis or something completely different?</p>
<p>Edit: Although, one book I think you should read is Effective Java by Joshua Bloch. Another one is Practical API Design: Confessions of a Java Framework Architect by Jaroslav Tulach.</p>
