    <title>[TV Series] Firefly?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tv-series-firefly/541048</link>
    <description>Whose watched one of the best and most underrated TV shows called Firefly? Created by Joss Whedon, who also directed/created the Avengers movie. This was a one year stint for his series. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)


I&#39;m very biased towards the show, as you can see. It&#39;s a Sci-Fi that showed on fox a measly-one season showing, but picked up a huge cult following years after the show stopped. It gained popularity after the show was cancelled, which led to them creating the movie &quot;Serenity&quot; to close it out for fans. Each episode of Firefly costed over a million dollars to produce at the time. Even though it was created in 2002, the graphics and special effects for this TV show are awesome. 

Has anyone watched this show or heard of it? If you&#39;re looking for something to watch and you like really well written Sci-Fi&#39;s, this is for you.</description>

Unless you want a dozen topics in this board for the purpose of being a funny picture or video. Sharing funny pictures and videos is kind of a general discussion we all talk about, probably the reason why it hasn’t been moved to this board.</p>
<p>OT: I’ll try get around to watching an episode. It seems like a really underground series, haven’t seen or heard about it at all.</p>

<blockquote>Firefly premiered in the U.S. on the Fox network on September 20, 2002. By mid-December, Firefly had averaged 4.7 million viewers per episode and was 98th in Nielsen ratings.[3] It was canceled after eleven of the fourteen produced episodes were aired. Despite the series' relatively short life span, it received strong sales when it was released on DVD and has large fan support campaigns.[4][5] It won a Primetime Emmy Award in 2003 for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series. The post-airing success of the show led Whedon and Universal Pictures to produce Serenity, a film based on the series.[4] TV Guide ranked it #5 on their 2013 list of 60 shows that were "Cancelled Too Soon".</blockquote>
