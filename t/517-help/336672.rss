    <description>Hi,  i just have two simple questions --
1. Well, my server only has a &quot;set level&quot; command, and many people find it too confusing to use, so what i would like to ask is : how do i add a ::master command? this means that you add a command that automatically sets all 99s.

2. how do i make certain commands so players can use them? for example, ::food for an inventory of shark, but make it so normal players can use it, not just admins

THANKS</description>
