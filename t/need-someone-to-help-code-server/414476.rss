    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-someone-to-help-code-server/414476</link>
    <description>Im really looking for a good coder i have some what experience but not enough to do everything on my own. I do not have a source yet, but the source will most likely be a 317. This server will go far with the right help. I am 15 years old and majoring in computer programming. and thats really it. so thanks.</description>

<p>I don’t get it, you say your majoring in programming, but you can’t code on your own and need help.  Also how to you major in anything if your only 15?  I’m 15 and an ok programmer, but I highly doubt you will do anything to help on the coding side of things.[/quote]<br>
GOING INTO THE MAJOR it has been my first week. my high school offers majors…</p>
