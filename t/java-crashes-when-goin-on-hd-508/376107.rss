    <description>Hey,

English translation:
Java(TM) Platform SE binary has stopped working
(Rest isn&#39;t important)

Also normal Runescape is working fine (in hd)
My PC specs:Windows 7 home premium, 32bit,4gb ram, Nvidia 9500 GT

extra info: My java is up to date and so is my graphics card</description>
