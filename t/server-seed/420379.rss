    <title>Server Seed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-seed/420379</link>
    <description>I downloaded the Minecraft Server, so that I could test my custom framework against the official one. I noticed that there is a property for the world seed, and a question came to mind. If you start a server with one seed, and then shut down the server, change the seed, and start it again, would all future chunks be generated with the new server seed?

EDIT: I tested for myself, and yes, all futures chunks will be generated with the new seed.

A mod can lock this.</description>
