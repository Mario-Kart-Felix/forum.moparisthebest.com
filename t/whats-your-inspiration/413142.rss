    <title>What&#39;s Your Inspiration?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-your-inspiration/413142</link>
    <description>  You know I was thinking about this the other day. I&#39;m sure all of us, when working on that project that we&#39;ve been working on forever. We lose motivation every now and then (maybe even forever?). Or we&#39;re tired of reading that book, and we lose motivation. Call me weird, but this happens to me quite a bit.

  So I&#39;m curious, who/what&#39;s your inspiration, or what keeps you going?
  
  Personally, when I come across this, I tend to watch time-lapse videos of people just working on programming. It motivates me, because that&#39;s what I love to do. A person I also look up too a lot is Notch (Minecraft Founder/Creator).</description>

              <p>I think motivation and inspiration are completely different worlds. I’ve been inspired to do dozens of projects, but hardly motivated to finish any of them. I’ve personally reached a stage where I have realized motivation can be as simple as saying no when I get bored with a project, and just continue working on it. Just focus on finishing it, no matter how boring it gets. It’s fine to take breaks, but I would personally not advising taking a break longer than a few weeks or month, at max, because you will most likely turn months into years and end up never finishing it.</p>
<p>Another perspective is looking at it like a job. Jobs are easy to become motivated at because you are rendering services and receiving a tangible reward, in most cases, a monetary one. In hobbies (seems especially virtual hobbies), when there is no tangible reward then even after you spend hours and hours working on a project, it doesn’t seem like an accomplishment when you’re done. So maybe look at it like a job, and try to come up with things you will gain when you finish it, so you can feel accomplished and have a <span class="bbcode-i">purpose</span> for doing it in the first place.</p>
<p>Heh, that was kinda rambly, but I hope I got my point across. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
