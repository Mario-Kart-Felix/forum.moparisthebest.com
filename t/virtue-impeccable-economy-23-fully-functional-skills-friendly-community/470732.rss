[center][code]The server Virtue, is a server that outdoes any server that is currently online.
This server gives players of this community, the best gaming experience they can possibly have, on a private server. 
This server has so much to do, that even when maxed, they cannot get bored. 
Our XP rate on this server is 20X runescape, which is the perfect amount to level up faster than runescape, while feeling a very good sense of accomplishment. 
The XP rate is designed to give you a small challenge, when maxing out your levels, and gives you a much harder challenge to reach that 200M marker. 
In Virtue, we have something called universal skilling. Which basically means, instead of having a zone designed specifically for skilling, 
we will make it so you can skill anywhere on Virtue. That means you can roam to anywhere across Virtue, and chop down trees/ mine 
some rocks depending on the locations in RS. What this allows a player to do, is get a good feel of real skilling rather than easy skilling. 
This will add a level of difficulty when getting those 99&#39;s also! The economy of Virtue is very stable, and will involve alot of skilling/trading. 
Here is the basic format of what this is like. You can buy base supplies from a shop (seeds for example). With those base supplies, you will 
have to make the herbs, which will then make the potions. This way, you just can&#39;t buy potions, which there is no sense of accomplishment in. 
These qualities make the server not only unique, but it sets a new standard in the community. So join today![/code][/center]
