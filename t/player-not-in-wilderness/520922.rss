    <title>Player not in wilderness?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-not-in-wilderness/520922</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not sure what I did but I try to attack another staff member in the wild and it say&#39;s &quot;that player is not in the wilderness&quot;

and that&#39;s at level 14 wilderness, it doesnt even show the level wilderness on the other acc or the attack option.
