    <title>Cache Help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-help/395519</link>
    <description>I was wondering how come when I add the cache files into the client folder to compile it and stuff, When I do compile it says it has compiled, but when I run the client the stuff I changed hasnt been changed to the new version of it.

Example: I changed the look of admin crown, I compile and it&#39;s still the same crown</description>
