    <title>Cache Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-help/288853</link>
    <description>Hello everyone I use PwnScape client and source. Lately I&#39;ve worked on my game alot and got tired of the floating helmets. I used Aeolians tutorial and i got snow models for metal fences. There was a solution there  but it didn&#39;t work.
I now use his new replaced textures cache. Personally I don&#39;t like it. And I can&#39;t find a cache that can support my Vesta Long &amp; spear, d bow, statius warhammer etc.
If anyone could help. Please don&#39;t come with the search bar. I have billions and billions of times. Downloading client after client and trying to use the cache. Or if anybody has a cache that is undamaged and has normal textures if they could give me a link or soemthing.
Or even a way to change back the textures using Tom&#39;s Cache Suite. Idk how to change floors and etc.
Thanks</description>

              <p>Get a clean cache, and preload the models so they don’t damage anything.</p>
<p>Also, moving to client help.</p>

              <p>I didn’t explain it properly, I meant that I did fix the helmets but then some snow models from godwars popped up and took over varrock bank<br>
s fences and alkharid’s gate as well. I used those models in the tutorial and it shoud’ve fixed. But it didn’t. I just need a new cache if you have one that supports my items/</p>
