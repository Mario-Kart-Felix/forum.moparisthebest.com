I don&#39;t know how to get the download link from dropbox, or even get the Cache right. Can you please help me, I&#39;ll repp ++.

Can you take a look at my cache.zip please:

I&#39;ve jarred my client now I&#39;m getting the &quot;Connection Error - Retrying in 5&quot;. Help please.

<p>Make sure you ARCHIVE your files into a zip folder instead of compressing it into a zip folder. I made that mistake. Go to <a href="http://dropbox.com" rel="nofollow noopener">dropbox.com</a> and create an account if you haven’t. Once you do that, log in, click the “Upload” button, and locate your cache ZIP folder. When you do that, it should show “Start Upload”. Click it and it should upload the link. After it’s done uploading, drag the file to your “Public” folder in the dropbox. Then, go to your public dropbox folder and click on the little arrow at the right side of the file you uploaded and click “Copy Download Link” Paste that into your CacheDownloader.java and anywhere else you need to. e.g I had to change the link in client.java too. You may not have to, I’m not sure.</p>
