    <title>Which Ip do I use?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-ip-do-i-use/374211</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;ve been trying to play on a private server I downloaded for about 8 hours now. But I don&#39;t know what Ip Address I use to put into the client.java and loader.java files. Do I use my host address that I made on no-ip.com, or do I use the static ip address I made? Thanks for your help.</description>

[/quote]when editing the ip of your client first of make sure what port your server is listening on make sure it is the same as you client also no-ip’s are not required its just a way of protecting your ip pretty much and it does connect say if someone is connecting to you no-ip name it then forwards their connecting to your routers ip (which hopefully is the ip you use when setting up your no-ip) you DO NOT use your static ip or dynamic ip of your cpu for your no-ip<br>
so make sure you have it right and also make sure you have done everything correctly in your router<br>
and in another note if you are editing you clients ip correctly to 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 you most definatly should be able to connect to your server (you being the only one) but still you should be abe to log in and edit things and so on[/quote]</p>
<p>Everything seems to be fine and correct… I don’t know why I can not connect if what you said is right. And no I can not connect to 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0</p>
<p>The only files I need to edit are the two client.java files and the loader.java right? This is what is in my client.java code:</p>
<pre><code>    Class68_Sub9.aString2883 = "127.0.0.1";
</code></pre>
<p>and in my loader.java code there is this:</p>
<p>Class68_Sub20_Sub15.ip = “127.0.0.1”;</p>
<p>Please help, I’ve been trying to figure this out for around 8 hours now. Very frustrated.</p>
