    <description>His ruminations were interrupted by the poke of something sharp in his back.He leapt forward — away from the pressure — and spun, drawing his sword, Flashing.The gate slammed in his face.On the other side stood Nirai Sathil.Your father spoke to Sul yesterday, and he apparently didn&#39;t know who I was.

He&#39;s still protecting Elhul.After what he did!And he&#39;s determined not to let any servant of Clavicus Vile take the weapon.What Vile didn&#39;t tell my father was what would happen when someone picked the sword up.The rest I think you know. 
I want this to be over with, finally.If you can get the sword from Elhul, you can have it, for all I care.Why lock us in?Cursing under his breath, Attrebus turned away from her and, holding his lantern in one hand and Flashing in the other, made his way as quickly as he could over the rough floor in the direction Sul had gone.The howling continued, a nerve-shivering, inhuman rasp that sometimes broke into what might be words in a language he didn&#39;t know.

Another few moments of stumbling brought him to the source.Sul had dropped — or maybe thrown — his lantern; it had shattered and was now a brightly burning pool of oil.In the ruddy light, Elhul Sathil was hideously revealed.He had skin but no flesh, and the skin fit him so tightly his bones were all plainly revealed.As he continued his terrible shrieking, Attrebus could see the apple of his throat bobbing, reminding him of a lizard or a frog.</description>
