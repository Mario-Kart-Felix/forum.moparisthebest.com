    <title>Ssi2?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ssi2/224311</link>
    <description>Guys, every script I use I keep getting this message when I try to run/compile the script.
[code]Include file C:\Documents and Settings\Matthew\My Documents\Matt\Media Player\Green Day\Autofighter Cheat Package\Macros\SCAR 3.15\includes\ssi2.txt does not exist.
Failed when compiling[/code]

Don&#39;t worry about everything before the SCAR 3.15 file...I just put it there to hide it from my mom...along with the rest of my macros and such.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 07, 2008, 01:33:10 pm[/size][hr]Thanks to the all includes.zip I just downloaded, that&#39;s no longer a problem...the problem now is this:
[code]Line 54: [Error] (68:51): Duplicate identifier &#39;UpChars&#39; in script C:\Documents and Settings\Matthew\My Documents\Matt\Media Player\Green Day\Autofighter Cheat Package\Macros\SCAR 3.15\includes\ssi2.txt[/code] Same file...maybe my computer just doesn&#39;t like ssi2.txt</description>

              <p>Is the SRL include the latest?</p>
<p>EDIT: Read the sticky by IP-Drowner:<br>
"Is there something wrong with your script? Something as an Include file? Then GET A NEW SCRIPT, since they must be out-dated then. Best place to look for much more better and advanced scripts is the SRL-Forums, however, you must be registered there for 7 days and have posted 10 useful posts Wink So don’t go spamming!</p>
<p>Most of the scripts around here are OUT-DATED, so don’t bother posting if the first posts date (inc. Edit date) is more than ONE MONTH old!</p>
<p>The best include to get is SRL! Since it is the ONLY include updated for the NEW RuneScape."</p>
<p>So yeah, you probably need the latest SRL include.</p>
