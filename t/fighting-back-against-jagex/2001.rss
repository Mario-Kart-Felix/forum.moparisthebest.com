    <description>ok so my main got baned for trading stuff...3 middlemen down the line lol. the miners got banned and all the middlemen and everything and all i traded was about 100 coal from 4 accounts. anyways. one of my miners didnt get banned so i thought...why not get other unsuspecting people banned just cuz im pissed off now. so i went to fally bank and took out like 5k coal and 2k mith ores. then  saw some guy that was level 98 i think and i gave it all to him for free. i know, im a jerk because im going to get him banned now. but i dont really care. jagex wont even take away the stuff i traded to my main and roll back some levels to give me my char back. so, this is what i am going to be doing from now on. ive been banned for 3 days now and on my second appeal i told them i would do this and they sent me their automated message saying the ban was permanent. so yeah i guess im kinda starting a war because in a day ive gotten about 3 high level people banned. from now on every time one of my autoers gets banned i will get somene else banned too. so tell all your friends and such not to accept large amounts of free stuff from anyone unless they know them :D</description>

alright well, me and xplar have been discussing things. and since people actually seem to be in support of getting back at jagex, or fagex for some <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> we’ve come up with this…</p>
<p>if you have ever had your main account banned, send the name to xplar, hes gonna make a script with all the names we get and it will be put on his site. then, anyone who is willing (the more the better) can go to world one the middle of varrock and start spamming the list. (unban xplar! unban mugein! unban redline! etc etc) i have already started getting ready by making an account by the name of Ban Petition. if anyone could atleast spare 1 bot to join in i think we could wreak havoc for everyone.</p>
<p>ps. apparently some people have been banned by doing drop trading, or so ive heard<br>
[/quote]1 of the most stupid ideas ive ever heard<br>
they will see that account autospamming and say o all those account were auto’ing also and that wont help[/quote]</p>
<p>um…mine have been banned for months</p>
