    <title>[317] Run.bat problem, Wtf does this mean?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-run-bat-problem-wtf-does-this-mean/287430</link>
    <description>I was using kevenscapes source as a base and i was adding shops then i got this...

what do i do and what does it mean?

Kevescape server.
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.numberformatexxception: For input string: &quot;100&quot;
 at java.lang.numberformantexception.forinputstring&lt;unknown source&gt;
 at java.lang.integer.parseint(unknown source)
 at java.lang.integer.parseint(unknown source)
 at shophandler.loadshops(shophandler.java:88)
 at shophandler.&lt;init&gt;(shophandler.java:33)
 at server.main(server.java:132)

Ok, so yea i looked in my shophandler, looked in shops.cfg, looked in client.java... it seems to all be fine.
i compile and it says the normal -xlint thing so it has no errors.. but when i do run.bat it says that above.

The last thing i did was add the fishing equipment shop with the npc 308... but i dont think that helps...</description>

              <p>If this occurred after adding a shop in then that would mean you have done it wrong. you can either remove that shop or fix it.</p>
<p>chances are you have used the space bar instead of the tab button.</p>
<p>in between the item you want in the shop and the amount you want in the shop you must press tab instead of spacebar.</p>

              <p>This means you made an error in a .Cfg file. You need to find that error and fix it then that will go away… Or redo shops all over again.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 07, 2009, 04:36:41 am[/size][hr]Because its not the run.bat’s problem, its the cfg file.</p>
