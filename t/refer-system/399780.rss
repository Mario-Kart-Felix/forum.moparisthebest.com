    <title>Refer system?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/refer-system/399780</link>
    <description>I added the command, and it writes out who was referred by or whatever.

Alright, so here&#39;s what I want to get at. I want to make another command called ::rclaim, so they could claim 5m GP for being referred. So how do I add a line in Character Saving called referPoints? and make ::rclaim take 1 refer point off everytime they claim their GP?</description>
