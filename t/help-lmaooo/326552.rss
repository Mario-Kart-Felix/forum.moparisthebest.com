    <description>Ok what i did is i made all my client maps and files invisible,
and what i thought was that only I could see them, but i was wrong
they vanished lol and now idk how to get them back?

By invisible i mean like the other servers,
when you dl their client, you can&#39;t see the files they have (you know to avoid leeching)
all you see is the run.bat, like mine..but what i want to do now is WHAT CAN I DO TO BRING EM&#39; BACK?? :P</description>
