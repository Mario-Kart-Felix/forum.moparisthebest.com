    <title>Need help getting 317 pi to load 508 maps</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-getting-317-pi-to-load-508-maps/548520</link>
    <description>Source + Client im using: acheron 317 pi

The main thing i need help with is getting it to load 508 maps.
god wars bosses are at death platue, and when i tele to god wars dung that floor and map is all black and i cant move but monsters are there. After looking that problem up on google i found that getting client to load 508maps will fix it. then moving the teles and npc&#39;s would be simple after that. 

If anyone could maybe walk me through it or help me out please that would be great.
ps: i did try to follow a guide already that i found on google but either i messed it up or it didnt work, it gave me tons of errors.

edit: 
-also ive now tried to download the hybrid pvp client and run it with my source because it is already 317 loading 508maps and it would not let me log in, it says error loading, please try again in one minute. (so thats currently what im trying to do it fix problem)
-also if someone thinks im wrong and the 508maps is not what i nneed to fix my godwars please let me know.</description>
