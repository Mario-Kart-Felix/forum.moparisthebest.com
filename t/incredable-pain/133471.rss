    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/incredable-pain/133471</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, today when playing football with my friends at school, my head got landed on.. Very, very, very harshly.

Now, my head feels really heavy, and I&#39;m dizzy and have a splitting head ache. It didn&#39;t worry me until about an hour ago, my had started feeling really bad... Every time I jerk it a little bit it cains the top of my head.

What should I do?</description>

Maybe a concussion, is there any swelling and/or bumps on your head?<br>
[/quote]<br>
No, that’s what I’m trying to find now…<br>
My neck feels really, weird… Like my head tilts really easily.<br>
My visions a bit blurry too.[br][size=1]Posted on: August 14, 2007, 05:30:36[/quote]<br>
Well the last time that happened to me I was high but I don’t think that is whats wrong with you so i just think its a concussion.</p>
<p>EDIT: fixed your quotes for you lol xD - jdb[br][size=1]Posted on: August 14, 2007, 09:16:31 PM[/size][hr]Thanks, I owe you bro.</p>

You may have concussion so just make sure you have someone near like a parent because there is a chance you will start throwing up. Other wise just wait a few days and your head will be back to normal.</p>
<p>Just rest, dont go do something stupid like sports. And other people have suggested ice… I think you should try this, the only thing it would do is keep pain away. So if it isnt benefitting you at all then there is no point in using ice.</p>

<p>I’ve had a concussion before - even a delayed one. But never as delayed if this is one. Max it was maybe an hour?<br>
It’s been nearly, what, 10 hours now?</p>
<p>I’m starting to get a bit worried as I seem to be getting a bit dizzier by the minute, and the pain is growing.<br>
I’m starting to get a bit worried if it might be a little bit of bleeding? Nah, wouldn’t be that bad.<br>
