        <p>Hello!</p>
<p>My brand new PC finally arrived, I picked it up yesterday night and set it in the desk for today. So i noticed something this morning on the side panel as i was opening the case, yup, a warranty sticker i was staring at it tearing down as i was sliding the panel like a retard. I was seriosly pissed, Is this even allowed? I bought one PC in my lifetime before but there was never a sticker on the side panel? Just had stickers on the screws of the components, Even though i’m going to visit them today at the store i want to know if i just seriosly void my warranty on a brand new PC? I feel like i scammed my self…</p>
<p>What do i tell them when i am there? I don’t know if they would help me…  :palm:</p>

        <p>I thought you were buying the components separately and building it yourself? Anyway, read the actual warranty. Usually that sticker just says “Read the warranty information…”. Since you have to open the side panel to change hard drive, upgrade components, etc. it doesn’t usually void the warranty even on a prebuilt.</p>

<p>Well i bought the CPU and the case from another store separately and got separate warrany as-well, And now i actually read the warranty paper which made me really surprised… They cover the whole PC for only one fudging year… And i barely understood as if they were trying to avoid getting into point somehow, And about the sticker says that it voids the labor warranty? As in they won’t fix it they only replace the parts if it were voided, Is that even a thing?!</p>
<p>They can’t seriously give me only one year warranty for the whole PC ( yes all parts as it were described ), Can i get that warranty from the actual manufacturer? For example, they obviously wrote down " 5 YEARS WARRANTY " on the caviar black WD hard drive.</p>
<p>And also when i was at the store ordering the pieces they offered me to build it because if i don’t no warranty would be included, I was like wtf? but i gave them to build it anyway… And gave them the CPU and case to use them with other other parts i ordered from their store.</p>
<p>for the CPU i have the 3 year warranty from that other store, but which is kind of useless since i’m OC’ing it…</p>

        <p>Usually warranties for electronics only apply if you don’t tamper with what’s inside of them. So if your computer randomly stops working, they have proof that you didn’t just open up the inside and mess everything up yourself. That’s why the sticker was peeling off as you were opening the case, which means you voided whatever warranty you had. Since it sounds like you had your computer pre-built, that specific warranty was exclusive to the company that put it together. If something inside goes wrong, that company will take care of it - provided you didn’t mess up or try to fix anything yourself. But since you ignored their policy and opened up the case, they won’t cover anything for you now. However, that doesn’t mean your individual hardware warranties were voided.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that damaging your processor by over-clocking isn’t covered in the warranty anyways, and you’re usually given warnings before doing so. The warranty that automatically comes with your hardware is usually if it stops working, not if you messed something up on your own. The only kind of warranties that cover that are ones you purchase ahead of time, like with phone plans you’re given the option to buy “accidental” protection, which would include fixing your phone if you dropped it or spilled something on it. By default, the limited warranty does not cover this.</p>
<p>In conclusion - anything that goes wrong with your computer now, you’ll have to fix yourself. You should still have individual warranties for your processor, hard drive, etc but you’re on your own.</p>

<p>Ah, then that is totally fine with me. I just thought that the component’s warranties were completely void as if the PSU failed there is nothing i can do to replace it, But its kind of stupid to lock the warranty on the case, how am i supposed to add a new SSD for example? or more importantly clean the dust, it would be stupid to drive there just so i can do simple stuff like that… but oh well.</p>

<p>Well it still wouldn’t make sense to void a warranty THIS way, would be more reasonable if it was in any other way. Just like i bought the CPU from that other store, they gave me a 3 year warranty with no sticker bs.</p>
<p>But i will keep searching for a clear answer from the folks around me.</p>
