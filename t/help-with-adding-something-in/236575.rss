    <title>Help with adding something in?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-adding-something-in/236575</link>
    <description>Ok, well lets say I wanted to add Galkon&#39;s dual wieldable godswords. How would I go about doing this? I know basically about my own server, but I have never added items like this through the class8.java file, so I need a COMPLETE rundown of how to do it. Thanks in advance I guess. =]</description>
