    <title>Problem adding &quot;some&quot; NPC&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-adding-some-npcs/50033</link>
    <description>The NPC ID&#39;s that are already listed in the autospawn.cfg work fine, but if I go to npc.cfg and find an ID there, they won&#39;t work and I get an error in the Runserver.bat. (After I compile of course.)

I was wondering if there&#39;s something special I have to do, or if it can&#39;t be done... I was basically adding some stuff, messing around and I tried to add a Kalphite Queen. So I added it to the autospawn.cfg and put all the info needed, but, it didn&#39;t work.</description>
