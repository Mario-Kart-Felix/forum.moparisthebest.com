    <description>Let&#39;s put it this way, I&#39;m guessing your an adolescent thinking game development is pretty darn cool (which it is), however, coding in general is becoming ever so advanced, and the concepts of game development are being driven by world leading industries in game development (e.g. SONY) that strive for perfection, so it&#39;s unlikely that you will be making the new &quot;perfect&quot; Call Of Duty game any time soon.

Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, all game developers started from somewhere, but not without the fundamental basics that are needed to succeed in making a decent game. 

Perhaps your wondering what the hell I&#39;m talking about? Well, in order to make a successful game than you will need most of these things:

[b][u][size=14pt]Large Scale Development[/size][/u][/b]

[b][u]Knowledge:[/u] [/b]
- Intermediate knowledge of general coding; the most popular gaming code languages are C++, and JAVA, so I&#39;d start learning these thoroughly before attempting to draw guns on GIMP.

[b][u]Team&#39;s:[/u][/b]
Have you considered the effort needed to develop a game, no? A major company such as Infinity Ward usually takes 8-14 months to successfully develop a game (e.g. Modern Warfare 2). Now let me tell you, Infinity Ward is not run by one person, it is a [b]company[/b] of several teams working day-by-day consistently. Imagine trying to accomplish what 50 people can do by yourself. That would take you a [b]VERY[/b] long time. So you will need to come up with a team, which then brings me to my next topic.

[u][b]Cost:[/b][/u]
You will need to provide for your development team, this means an office, multiple computers; hundreds of thousands of dollars will be needed in the development stages of your game. The budget for large scale developments varies from at least $20,000 - several millions of dollars. 

[b][u][size=14pt]Small Scale Development[/size][/u][/b]

Small development team dairy log: (Very useful for individuals wanting to start understanding what a &quot;small&quot; scale development team attribute to)
[url=http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/reference/103/postmortems/small-scale-development-grand-scale-ideas-r2314]http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/reference/103/postmortems/small-scale-development-grand-scale-ideas-r2314[/url]



I hope I have enlightened your mind of what game development consists of; not just cool animations or graphics, but the determination to create something amazing. Please, i hope i haven&#39;t effected your dreams in the future, but keep in mind that game development is only attempted by the determined, not script kiddies who know how to make themselves spawn items on a Runescape private server.


Will be adding more game development related topics asap.

[NOTE] This Thread is introducing the concepts of the beginning stages of development for industry standard games, and i believe the Moparscape community will benefit from something like this as most code lovers want to begin developing something better than a RSPS after uni.</description>

              <p>I completely disagree with the point of this topic. You don’t need a big company to make a game. You can make a fun game that you and your friends can play together, coded by only you or maybe a few 2-3 other people.</p>
<p>Really, you are a hypocrite. I’m certain you didn’t throw away 20K to ONE MILLION dollars to make a game. If you did, no one else is going to spend that much, and that means, this topic is nothing but horse shit and no one will use as reference.</p>

<p>If you make a “good” game, it’s going to get good results, as long as you show it to someone.</p>
<p>One of my new favorite games of all time: Demon’s Souls. Originally, this game was expected to sell less than 75,000 copies, and that’s probably a bunch of the anime-freaks who followed the game developers’ other games (anime games, basically). Anyway, Demon’s Souls was ridiculously successful, moving from Japan and Asia, to North America, and eventually to Europe, where many people on <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> of these continents still play it. The thing is, this game was extremely budgeted, and probably lacked some planned content because they didn’t want to piss off their publisher any further (had been pushing back the dates).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr</span> money isn’t, and never will be, the only option to success. It’s just the lazy-way-out.</p>

explain how some of the best games of our time were developed by one person? Mortal Kombat only had like 6 people in the credits.<br>

<p>I’m going to assume that your illiterate question was criticism, but I do agree, and I believe the entire Moparscape community will also agree as Runescape Private Servers are pretty much developed from one or few people, however, I simply created this thread to introduce what it takes to create anything better than a private server of a popular game, which I believe ALL RSPS developers will benefit from.[/quote]<br>
Work on your grammar and syntax before criticizing others.</p>

<p>Yep, and even at the moment I think the only people who work on the Minecraft code are Notch and jeb_. The other people do things like customer support, the website, the other game (Scrolls) and business stuff.</p>

You lost me there…</p>
<p>Iirc, it took infinity ward a few years to develop the engine for cod4.  Now, it takes them and Treyarch 8-14 months to write a shitty storyline, tweak a few things (extreme emphasis on few), and create new models.</p>
<p>“You will need to provide for your development team, this means an office, multiple computers; hundreds of thousands of dollars will be needed in the development stages of your game. The budget for large scale developments varies from at least $20,000 - several millions of dollars.”<br>
I would love to know who’s ass you pulled those stats out of.</p>

Yes, as of last last year there was a <span class="bbcode-b">team</span>, but if you look into the history, its a game developed from the game mannic diggers, by Notch 90% himself. His team didn’t come about until around sep. or oct. when he started talking about forming one, and december when he found a office.</p>

              <p>There are actually many games out that were developed by a single or few people. Also, making a game does not require a team, office, budgets, or anything except time, knowledge, and a computer (of course an API or something for whatever you are developing it for, EX: Xbox, PS3, PSP, etc). The teams, money, and everything will only speed up the process majorly. I actually don’t feel you have covered anything in this topic, as the requirements are very minimal in reality. As '_s" said, games can be done in small forms, or even large forms. Please, do some research yourself, and cover the bare minimum it would actually take to create a game, instead of saying you need to have tons of cash ready to blow and hope it does good.</p>

<p>By the way, _S, I did mention that the entire Moparscape community will agree that this thread is disturbing the balance of RSPS development concepts, thus the reason why criticism is greatly appreciated. But I do agree with your intelligent remark, so included within this thread will be both large scale developments and small scale developments to even out the Menacescape communities thoughts on this.</p>
