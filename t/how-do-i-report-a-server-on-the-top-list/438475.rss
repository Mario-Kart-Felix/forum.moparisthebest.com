<p>He said he wouldn’t change their uptime. There are certain rules on Sponsored Servers and the Server Status Page, anything in breach of them can and will be edited by Moparisthebest.</p>

<p>You should probably contact an admin, and give them every piece of proof you can find. Although, you cant really do a whole lot about the money. If it was through paypal, you could open a dispute, but they dont like dealing in virtual items, because its not only hard to prove, but hard to handle ‘oh, i just forgot to give it to him’ type thing.</p>
