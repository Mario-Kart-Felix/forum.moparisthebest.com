    <description>I&#39;m sure this is a frequently asked question, especially by new guys here.  I&#39;ve actually been around for quite some time, since 2007, but I forgot [i]ALL[/i] the account details of my old account.  Back in the day I was up to date with all the best servers, but now I&#39;m completely lost.  A few guys around school here started getting nostalgic about the old runescape being re-released, but lets be real.. it&#39;s never going to be the same.. and none of us want to pay for memberships either right now.  So would anyone mind bring me up to speed on what all the new servers are like these days, and which are the best to get a start with?  I&#39;m seeing all these Delta servers and PI servers; I have no idea what it&#39;s all about.  I&#39;m really just looking for a basic 317, but I&#39;d like to know what benefits delta or pi or whatever has to offer for me.

Thanks in advance, and sorry for the noob question.</description>

              <p>I have a 317 PI currently minimal problems all the problems with it me and my co fixed. I had a delta Pk planet didn’t really like it it was a messy source in the rsinterface it had like maybe 4 codes in it making it difficult to put a donator tab in so then my friend quit and gave me his PI 317 server that i currently own and the codes are really clean easy to read, easy to put shit in and take shit out. No clue of what servers are out there either but my point in my post is just look for a 317 PI they are beautiful.</p>
