    <title>What would you prefer on a server?</title>

    <description>Yes this is helping me on developing my very own server which I have decided to create  :).

I have many questions for you to answer folks. Many that are very complex for myself though. What I would like to ask is:

[code][u][b]What kind of server do you prefer best for yourself?[/b][/u]
Player Killing
Peaceful world fill with multifarious activity&#39;s to attend to
or both

[u][b]Other comment:[/b][/u]
Specify this if you think there needs to be more added.[/code]</description>
