5. Dice Works but whenever i try and roll in the FC or Clan Chat , i wield the dice , or whenever i do private it works fine , Can someone teach me to get those dice that roll in a fc or the ones that say it outloud , and mithril seeds dont plant.

6. When your ingame you can do ::donate and ::website , etc , how do i change those? and make it my own donation site + website.
