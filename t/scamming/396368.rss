    <title>Scamming?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/scamming/396368</link>
    <description>So I was in Falador and this guy was asking who wants to see an armour trick, me being the smarty pants I am said I would. So he comes up to me and is like take off your armour, and then he trades me. He then goes to his bank and comes back in places 302 coins in the trade box, that being the amount that my armour was worth in a trade (less then the G.E prices). So anyways, he then tells me to accept it and click wealth 100 times really fast. I knew what he was getting at so I just sat there and waited for him to accept, once it got onto the second trade screen I closed off the trade and called him a noob. I proceeded to say that I knew what he was up to and he called me a noob. He then went to his bank and pulled out 1,000,000, then came back to me and showed me in a trade screen. I asked him if that was it and he said that he had a dragon axe on loan, me being the awesome pro I am (sarcasm if you didn&#39;t get that) went and pulled out an item worth 123,098,587. He then like rage quit while pretending he didn&#39;t care.  

And before anyone goes ahead and says &quot;pics or it didn&#39;t happen&quot; which you probably wouldn&#39;t anyways...  ;D

Its common sense to know that by saying that he means, hacked threads, scammed threads, and over all “I’m here to bitch about my runescape life threads”.[/quote]<br>
Well first of all, i wasn’t bitching. I was just telling a story, so that rule doesn’t apply to this thread. If it did a mod would of deleted it when they moved it don’t you think?</p>

              <p>So I was in Falador and this guy was asking who wants to see an armour trick, me being the smarty pants I am said I would. So he comes up to me and is like take off your armour, and then he trades me. He then goes to his bank and comes back in places 302 coins in the trade box, that being the amount that my armour was worth in a trade (less then the G.E prices). So anyways, he then tells me to accept it and click wealth 100 times really fast. I knew what he was getting at so I just sat there and waited for him to accept, once it got onto the second trade screen I closed off the trade and called him a noob. I proceeded to say that I knew what he was up to and he called me a noob. He then went to his bank and pulled out 1,000,000, then came back to me and showed me in a trade screen. I asked him if that was it and he said that he had a dragon axe on loan, me being the awesome pro I am (sarcasm if you didn’t get that) went and pulled out an item worth 123,098,587. He then like rage quit while pretending he didn’t care.</p>
<p>And before anyone goes ahead and says “pics or it didn’t happen” which you probably wouldn’t anyways…  ;D</p>
