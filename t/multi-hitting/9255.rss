    <description>Sup peoples,

I would like to know how do you do the double attack while fighting? By double attack I mean you like attacking with one weapon, then switching to magic or another weapon and being able to hit very fast. I&#39;ve heard of people doing it but never found out how.

Thanks.</description>

              <p>[quote=“PaulT, post:5, topic:9255”]On FTP, use scimitar, and when the person is to around 20 health, you switch to r2h, click on them quickly to attack, and switch back to scimmy.</p>
<p>No matter what you do after you hit with r2h, you have to wait for a second, so eat a lobster real quick while you wait. This trick is relatively effective, much more so if you have a high ranged level and switch from range to 2h, then to scimmy, because range is very fast you can whittle down their health, switch to R2h for k0, and if k0 fails use scimmy to drive their health back down.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks, so far your’s works the best PaulT.</p>

<p>Oh and what I mean by impossible is that the attack interval will still have effect even if you switch weapons. Of course, if you use a fast weapon then a slow weapon, you’ll do more damage.[/quote]</p>
<p>Nope the “switching” weapons doesn’t work, I think it reads it as eating food wait time.</p>
