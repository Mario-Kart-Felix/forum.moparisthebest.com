    <description>Hello there

There are a few functions that is not included in scar, but are found in the delphi language. Since I know how to make them in delphi, [u]and[/u] I read that the plugins in SCAR is made in delphi. I found hope that i &quot;could&quot; create a dll file including the new functions.

This is a bit farfetched. But it would help a great deal if atealst a few of my questions here could be answered.

1. How do you inlcude the dll&#39;s? (are they included automaticly if you add them in the plugins folder?)

2. whats the basics of making your fuctins into a dll?

Please be gentle.
