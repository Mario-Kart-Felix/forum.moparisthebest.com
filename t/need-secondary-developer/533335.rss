    <description>Hello there friends,

Today, obviously I&#39;m here because I&#39;m in need of ANOTHER developer. We&#39;re currently working on a very large project that&#39;s going to be like no other RSPS out there. We&#39;re needing somebody with a creative mind, and is just an overall nice person. If I, or our main Developer think that you&#39;re impossible to get along with, or just isn&#39;t friendly in any way, shape, or form, you will not get the position. The server has been on approximately 3-4 Months. It&#39;s been turned offline until the V2 is released because there&#39;s really no point in dealing with all of the drama for absolutely nothing, but anyways, back on the point. 

What I&#39;m looking for in this Secondary Developer:

[ul][li]You need to be able to add new content, and I don&#39;t just mean editing shops, or something like that.[/li]
[li]You CANNOT be power hungry like I expect most people will be if they put something on this post.[/li]
[li]You need to state your below in the response section below.[/li][/ul]


Thank you, please leave your Skype and Experience below.

EDIT: 
I literally put no information about the server, hmm...
The server is a 718/742 RSPS called Disturbed718. The server is obviously offline right now as I said above, but the forums link is: *
We have a great team overall, and just need 1 more to add on.</description>
