    <description>Ok so I have just finished making a server and I set my environment variables because before they were not correct which were causing some problems but now I made them and the compiler now works but my Run.bat still does not work. When I click on Run.bat here is what pops up: (WINDOWS XP)

And my environment variables are also set here is a pic of the &quot;path&quot; file:
