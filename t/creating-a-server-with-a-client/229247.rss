    <title>Creating a Server with a Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-server-with-a-client/229247</link>
    <description>Hey everyone. I want to make my own private server. I have NEVER done anything like it before and I am wondering if it would be hard for me to make a server with a client that people have to download in order to play. I wouldn&#39;t mind using the silab client if its the only way but I would much rather make my own. I would like to start off with a basic base and build up. The only problem is that I have no clue how to do it. Can anyone post links to guides or something?</description>

              <p>Basically</p>
<p>All the stuff in quote marks should be searched using Moparscapes search</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download “Galkons Base Client”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extract it and look for a file called client.java NOT client.class</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3.ON notepad go on Replace By pressing CNRL+H</p>
<p>4.Replace “Galkons Base” With what ever your client should be called and save the file</p>
<p>5.Then CLick On COMPILE and wait a couple of secs and then you CLick On RUN</p>
<p>6.Then GO onto the Board called “RS2 Server DOwnloads” and CLick on the word Views and the Views will order in accessending and then click it again the bring the most viewed Topics</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Choose a Source (THIS CANT BE A 474 503 OR 508) (Prefebly “Acid Blitz” :D)</li>
</ol>
<p>8.Extarct the Source and open client.java and DO replace Change %What Ever Server you downloaded% to your name and save the file</p>
