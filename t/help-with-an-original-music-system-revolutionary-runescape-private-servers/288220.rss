    <title>Help with an original Music System. Revolutionary Runescape Private Servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-an-original-music-system-revolutionary-runescape-private-servers/288220</link>
    <description>Hey guys, ive you&#39;ve ever played BlazeScape, then you would know that they have a original Music System, but ive just figured out the main concept, but i have no idea how to implement it in-game.

Well, is there anyway for specific places to play a specfic sound, or song from my music list? For example, when they log into the server, i want it to place a specific sound, i have it in my &quot;music&quot; Folder, but now what?

I know this is CLIENT+SERVER related, but seriously, just this once help a guy out who is trying to do something, which has only ever been done once (to my knowledge)

thanks a lot guys!!!
