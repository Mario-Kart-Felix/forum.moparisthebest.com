    <title>Logging Out Nulls</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/logging-out-nulls/277758</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just realized that sometimes when a player logs out, I guess it doesn&#39;t log them out completely or disconnect them fully and when they log out, they will leave a null in my player list. Now, I have added Coder Xynt&#39;s strong IP ban, which will stop people from intentionally nulling me if I IP ban them, but this is another thing when a player logs out. How can I fix this?</description>
