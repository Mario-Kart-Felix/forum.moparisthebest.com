    <title>Project Unknown - 317 - Soon to be Flawless</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-unknown-317-soon-to-be-flawless/526809</link>
    <description>Greetings mopar users, today I am going to be sharing some of the knowledge on my new upcoming server: Project Unknown. Now of course the name will not be called Project Unknown but that is just to protect the name that I have in mind. Either way here are some details about it. 

-Features-
98% Dueling - Needs a few small fixes.
Minigames - Barrows - Pest Control
All skills fully work, and I don&#39;t mean workarounds I mean the skills actually 100% work.
Amazing Graphics for what it loads.
A few custom items - for the people that love customs
Player Owned Shops - 80% Working - Pretty much like the Grand Exchange I understand this has been done before.


This project has been in my care for about 13 months, have not really discussed it and it was just a thing to take my mind off school and work. 

I will be posting photos in the near future you can expect a release date of around 8/15/2013 possibly sooner if you have any suggestions, questions, or thoughts feel free to send me a private message or post a comment.</description>
