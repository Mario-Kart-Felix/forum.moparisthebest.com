    <title>What language would you advise?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-language-would-you-advise/265001</link>
    <description>I have quite a large collection of e-books, and I want to organize them. First I tried to spread them over various folders, but I didn&#39;t like that &#39;system&#39; as it lacks quite a few features. So I came up with the following:

A program that lists all e-books, and allows you to sort all e-books by genre.
Apply a genre to a book.
Allows you to print a list of all books, or sorted by genre, on paper or in HTML format.
Search for a book.
Open a book by clicking on the title, with a e-book reader (like Foxit Reader).
etc..

Basically, a program you can find at your local library. 

But what is the best language for this? It doesn&#39;t have to bee low level, because all it has to do is load a .txt with info and save it back to that file. My idea was Delphi, as it&#39;s easy to program and even easier to design a GUI with. But what do you think?</description>

<p>As I’ve switched to Arch, I guess Delphi and C# are out of the question? I think I’ll just use Java and XML, and when I completed it and feel the need I might rewrite it either in C++ or C, so I can learn those languages a bit more too.</p>
