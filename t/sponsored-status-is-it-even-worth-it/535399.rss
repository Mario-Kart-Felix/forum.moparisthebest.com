    <title>Sponsored Status, is it even worth it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sponsored-status-is-it-even-worth-it/535399</link>
    <description>So I was rank 7 last month, according to my hit counter on it, i got 2k hits to the page (non-unique), if someone refreshed page or viewed multiple times, still went up, so not an accurate reading

So today I was looking at my analytics, and didn&#39;t even see mopar in top 10 traffic sources, 

114 went to site, then 45% of those left within 5 seconds

maybe they just don&#39;t like silabgarza, but i feel that that the status page doesn&#39;t get as much traffic as it use to...

So I feel that the sponsored server section is no longer worth what it was in the beginning. And i&#39;m sure i&#39;m not the only one to notice, considering it seems like every month 10th place takes a while and goes for $25</description>

<p>Its probably because a lot of people know Silabgarza so they already checked your server page out or the server it self.</p>
<p>Would say its worth it if you have that extra money to spend  :P[/quote]</p>
<p>mine is the same. i done sponsored list once and reseved over 2x players than i had and alot more donations.</p>

              <p>I laughed at that one, hades, $17805 wow. Buy Moparisthebest a new car. I on the other hand forgot to update our bid, so we may be able to benefit from your outrageous bid.</p>
<p>OT:<br>
We got almost 7k hits from the 5th spot, I haven’t set up analytics yet so I don’t know the exact stats, with mopar being our only advertisement. Changing the logo to the varied events we were doing helped significantly, players seem to swarm to ‘Double XP’ and other event types.</p>

              <p>It’s not moparscape that’s the problem, it’s the scene in general. Everything is going down everywhere. Especially now that school has started. Regardless of what it’s worth the, the spots will go for what people are willing to pay, because it’s an auction. Just look at me, I put up nearly 18k for my spot, because I feel passionate about being number 1!</p>
