    <title>Cache extractor</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-extractor/228300</link>
    <description>All right so right now im currently running off a source, but i need to get into the cache and remove some stuff (such as unwanted buildings). I was told the cache was the only way to do that. Well, as you all already know, you cannot edit the cache without extracting it. Is there any way of extracting it and then packing it back up? Is there a program that will do this for me? Is there a way i can hack it?</description>
