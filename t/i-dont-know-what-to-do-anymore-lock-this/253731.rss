    <description>[b]I do not believe i put up with this bullshit for over a month, when the solution was that i just needed to clean out the inside of it... wow i&#39;m just a fucking moron... a moron who also could fuck up a ubuntu installation more than 5 times, yeah... five times.

This can be locked.[/b]

Re-formatting is not an option. My computer gets the blue screen of death like every ten minutes, and says it is doing a virtual memory dump. It has been doing this for at least a month. Before it shuts off, usually 2/3 programs just shutdown, without warning. I have done 2 different kinds of diagnostic checks, they all came back fine. I have updated my computer. I send in error reports, and i either get a corrupted error report or an error report that says that there is a device driver error. I really need help, because I&#39;m assfucked. I&#39;ve done virus scans and everything, no virus. The only explanation for this happening is that I&#39;ve been torrenting music, but I used an external disk to do it, all the music was on that disk. I seriously need help... or else I&#39;m going to have to spend like 50$ getting a diagnostic test from Staples or something.</description>

I had this problem before, done the above and it works perfectly now.</p>

<p>Please enable the computer to hang on BSoD’s rather than reboot and copy the error here. It will help a lot for diagnostic purposes.</p>

<p>Re-formatting is not an option. My computer gets the blue screen of death like every ten minutes, and says it is doing a virtual memory dump. It has been doing this for at least a month. Before it shuts off, usually 2/3 programs just shutdown, without warning. I have done 2 different kinds of diagnostic checks, they all came back fine. I have updated my computer. I send in error reports, and i either get a corrupted error report or an error report that says that there is a device driver error. I really need help, because I’m assfucked. I’ve done virus scans and everything, no virus. The only explanation for this happening is that I’ve been torrenting music, but I used an external disk to do it, all the music was on that disk. I seriously need help… or else I’m going to have to spend like 50$ getting a diagnostic test from Staples or something.</p>
