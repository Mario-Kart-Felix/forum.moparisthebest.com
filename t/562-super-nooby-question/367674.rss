    <description>Okay, now I have completely blanked out, and I forgot what to do to get it online.

Do i have to change the ip on the source side somewhere? If I do where.
And on the client where do I change the ip&#39;s, I already changed it in client.java but is that it? My client came already set on local host, so I&#39;m not sure what to change exactly :S

EDIT: okay so my server works fine on local host, but when I attempt to put my ip, it says &quot;connecting to update server&quot; and doesnt change -.- any ideas?</description>
