    <title>Absolute newbie needing help with Image matching script</title>

    <description>Hey (:

So I just learned about what SCAR is and what it can do, and I&#39;m looking to write my own script which matches images from Neopets for the Mystery Pic competition.
I would like to know a few things, if anyone could be kind enough to explain to me:

1) How does SCAR find an image? Like, do I select the browser where Neopets is loaded at to run the script or...?
2) What must I do to write a fully functional script like that? (eg. compile a database of Neopets images, etc.)

Much thanks in advance to those who help me out. (:</description>

              <p>No actually this is pretty easy just get maybe alot of bitmaps of the neopets and use the findbitmap function to find those bitmaps.</p>
