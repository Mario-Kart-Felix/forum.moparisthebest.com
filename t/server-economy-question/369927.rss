    <title>Server economy...question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-economy-question/369927</link>
    <description>okay, i remember 3 years ago when i was 13 years old, i began coding/hosting my own server... and it had over 138 players witin the first week or 2, but now i host my server 24-7 no downtime, and i have less then 10 active players, was it because i was immature and came up with gay ideas? or what was it, nowadays people make it so you have to train hard of some sort for your stats, and im guessing thats not what players want, so im asking for your guys&#39;s opinions... HOW DO YOU GET AND KEEP YOUR PLAYERS, and Dont post a link to some economy tutorial, because those are usless in my book, but yea, im just sick of how my co owner keeps nagging me about he&#39;s bored, and &#39;we need players&#39;

So, what should i do guys,

change server to pk/spawn? or what do you reccomend me adding.

appreciated...

              <p>Actually back in the old days there was only like 24 servers and they weren’t in order from 100%-40% they were just scattered. Good ol’ days…  Now a days you pretty much have to get a sponsored spot to get 30+ players… We made the sponsored page too commercial, and the setting up of servers too easy. (Which I’m not saying is necessarily a bad thing, but it does really kind of force you to buy a VPS and a sponsored spot to even compete.)</p>

              <p>Depends on the player…<br>
I met a couple lazy ones that comes on and starts begging for staff or 1 hit k0 weapons<br>
i suggest adding some kind of mini-game with 508 customs to make them join<br>
Quests are a second thing, not just the old delta quests everyone that has probably been figured out by now</p>
