    <description>Well i recently downloaded Exion something server from server downloads, and I&#39;m new to PI so anyways i came across  a big i guess when i try to light a fire it says &quot;Firemaking is disabled&quot; any one know where i can go to enable it?

 and also i want a Gnome pilot at the servers home, so then when a person clicks him they would teleport to agility area, where would i go to make the game teleport you there by clicking him?

<p>the knome pilot is in is in the spawn list, search him up then put the coords u want in autospawn.cfg. rep plz</p>

<p>That’s not what he is wanting. He is wanting it so people will click on the NPC, and teleport to whatever area.</p>
<p>Anyway,</p>
<p>I would look in the Firemaking Handler for that, and then for the NPC, I would create a case for him in Client.Java I believe.</p>
