    <title>Keeping an item when you die/You can only see it on the floor</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/keeping-an-item-when-you-die-you-can-only-see-it-on-the-floor/394707</link>
    <description>Well I was playing this Rsps the over day to see what I could add to mine and I realised when I died I kept like barrows gloves. They just stayed on the floor and no one could keep them. I found a mate who was a donor and he could run back for his claws aswell, but on my rsps, when someone dies they can just see the drops. Can someone help me on how you can only see it on the floor?</description>
