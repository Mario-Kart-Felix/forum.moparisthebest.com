    <title>Client not connecting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-not-connecting/525634</link>
    <description>Okay guys, so after a few frustrating days i&#39;ve managed to put my server together. I got everything online and was waiting for players to finally arrive. But after seeing 10+ client downloads...i knew something was wrong. I change the IP to mine and my Port was still open but couldn&#39;t connect. I really need some kind of physical help or something. Id even give the client folder for you to look at.</description>

              <p>Have you portforwarded correctly? If not check out a tut on how to do so.<br>
Make sure your IP is set to the one you’re using in NO-IP, (which im assuming you’re using). It should be located under “server =” in your client.java file. If all of the above is done correctly maybe it’s your fire wall. I’ve had many instances where everything was set perfectly and my firewall wouldn’t allow inbound connections. Try resetting your firewall and try again.</p>
