    <title>Need some help here from someone from the rs-server dev team</title>

    <description>Everyone hates the dreaded &quot;failed to find connection vertex&quot; errors.  However, they are a special problem to me, because they crash my server.  Completely.  I have studied them a bit and the fatal ones only occur to a client with a playerID of 0.  Any freaking idea why this happens?  Has anyone figured out a better way of handling walking?  This is the one thing left messin up my server.  Thanks.</description>
