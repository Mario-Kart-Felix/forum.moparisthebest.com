    <description>I run a 562 rs2hd base server and the ::yell command is only for donator plus. i want for all players

same with the ::curses true its moderator plus but i need for all players.
or i need to have the altar but when i go to spawn it its just blank. And yes i know im doing everything right its just not there.

Im not going to bother posing the code for yell because i have litterally tried everything
from making it player.right == 0 and putting under that right category.

If you can fix ill love you forever. Please teamview meee &lt;3</description>
