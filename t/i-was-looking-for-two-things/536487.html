The second one, the only way i can try and describe what it is, is by this. The home was at clanwars, it was a PVP server, and you could spawn stuff in the quest tab i believe. And there was one quest, and you had to find titans around part of the map, then you had to fight the inadequacy to obtain a item i dont remember. If i remember right it was a 508 server…</p>
<p>If you can show me where i can download these servers ( with clients) i would be very greatful. Or if you know someone whos hosting these, it would be fun to play before my internet gets shut up in 10 days. Thanks in advance!</p>
