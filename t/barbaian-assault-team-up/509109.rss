    <title>Barbaian Assault - Team Up!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/barbaian-assault-team-up/509109</link>
    <description>So, since its so difficult to find a decent team in Barbarian Assault, I figured why don&#39;t we make up a community thread where people interested can post here and add other people. 

For those who aren&#39;t familiar with Barbarian Assault, its a super fun minigame where you get rewards that are completely worth it. Such as Penance Gloves which are similar to Boots of Lightness, but take off more than twice the weight that Boots of Lightness do. And also, the second reward that is worth it is the Fighter&#39;s Torso which gives you some pretty sick bonuses. It is probably the most fun minigame on this era of RuneScape.

The unofficial world for Barbarian Assault that everyone uses is 306. I am usually logged in for long increments of time and will usually be playing it constantly. For those who want to play, join the CC &quot;foz&quot; which is the MoparScape clan chat so we can further talk. :P

Happy Barbarian Assaulting! :D</description>
