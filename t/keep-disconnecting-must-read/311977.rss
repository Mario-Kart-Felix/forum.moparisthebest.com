    <description>Hi guys... me firefoot here! Ive already sent a post about dis and other people have b4 too, but im seriously concerned. My server logs in once, but disconnects in a few seconds, and says &quot;Error connecting to server. Must be down. Click &#39;Cancel&#39; then &#39;start server&#39; to make your own. It always comes up with that, and i really wanna no how to fix it, and to stop it disconnecting. Also, i havent any files on the server, all i have is the game to double click and run it. I have NO files on it, and all i can do is run the game. So i cant do anything easy to change it.  :confused: Please help. Im really concerned, Please reply asap, need help. Thanks!!!  ;D</description>
