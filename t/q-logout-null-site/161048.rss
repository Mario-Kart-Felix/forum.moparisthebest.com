    <title>[Q] Logout + NULL +Site</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/q-logout-null-site/161048</link>
    <description>1) well most of the anti null scripts dont really work, can anyone show me a tutorial that work?

2) i have been looking for the logout system, i wanna make it so people dont auto logout every 5 seconds instead its like 60 minutes etc =)

3) does anyone have a good template to share? or if released give me a link? looking forward to try some of the nice work people do here.
