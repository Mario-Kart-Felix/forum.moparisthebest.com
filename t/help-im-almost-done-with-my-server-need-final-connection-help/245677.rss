    <description>Hello.

Thanks for reading this.

Ok so i have problems with connecting from another computer to my server. From the computer that is running the server, it runs fine. All i need to do is get it to be able to play from any1&#39;s computer.


I have it based off of Xscape....

It works fine on the computer with the server... like i changed my rights on my character and everything. How do i make it so other people can play on it. I tried to use Utorrent but that didnt work. Help please.


Its called *.no-ip.org

Thanks

<p>I have two desktop conputers in my house connected on the same router in the same room.</p>
<p>Would that matter if i am useing the newest computer, which would mean the older one is the main computer or something?</p>
<p>Would i need to  run the server on the other computer?</p>

<p>Advertisment. You have to run ur server (DUH?) and you must set up a no-ip. <a>url=http://no-ip.com</a>[/url] And you need to portforward. Start-&gt;Run…-&gt;Type <code>cmd</code>-&gt; then type <code>ipconfig</code>. Look at you IP address. Then type it at your address bar and login then portforward.</p>
