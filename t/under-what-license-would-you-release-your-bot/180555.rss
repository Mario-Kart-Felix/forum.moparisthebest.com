    <title>Under what license would you release your bot?</title>

    <description>I was a &quot;grassroots&quot; hippie - what ever that means - and believed everything worth being released is GPL&#39;d.

Well we&#39;ve seen places where that failed. Aryan being GPL&#39;d is a prime example. First they released and all of a sudden their users exploded in number. Releasing updates every week or so was fine for a while, but they pretty soon got pissed off with the influx of n00bs begging them for faster updates. Then just before the time that RS changed such that it wouldn&#39;t recompile people started releasing their &#39;own&#39; bots. Lukeidiot&#39;s was a prime example but I&#39;m not pointing fingers, there were just too many to count. I my self started &#39;improving&#39; aryan with small modifications. Understandably the Aryan team got pissed off.

So assuming we have a kick ass bot how do we release it allowing people to use it without any monetary costs and other such lock-ins?

Ideas? Suggestions? More examples? Yes. Bitching about how such and such stole code? Get stuffed.</description>

<p>Simple.</p>
<p>I typically release nothing. evo, psb, winterlove, and maybe one or two others have seen any of my systems. I don’t care about credit. I don’t have to prove anything.</p>
<p>Incidentally Mousepad, the developer of the original d2 maphack, had probably the most sophisticated protection system I had ever seen. Rule of thumb, if you want it protected, why the hell are you developing it in java? The only way you can write something that is safe is if it is truly service oriented. You give the user a thin client and your servers do the heavy lifting. If they do not have the code, they do not have anything to crack.</p>

<p>Nothing (Though I could prevent most noobs from being able to modify the program). Nothing. At least, for any program whose existance, development or usage involves breaking the law.</p>

              <p>On the original point, license dosent matter, we didnt mind people using our code, taking credit for our code with no work being put in was another thing. What really annoyed us was the idiots thinking we owed them anything, bitching and moaning as if they were paying customers. Why you even brought that up is beyond me, because that wasnt a licensing issue, if we were closed source yet free the same thing would of happened, especially when the updater wasnt released.</p>
<p>Sidenote: A class is always defined, dosent matter where it comes from or if your try to encrypt the classes etc etc so dont even bother trying unless you are adding another level of annoyance which some of the idiots in these communities might not be able to get around.</p>
<p>Speaking of idiots in these communities, claiming to be better than anyone else because you <em>CLAIM</em> to have a life is quite a strange thing to do. If you have a life would you be writing code and using mopar to inflate your own ego? All of the aryan devs have lives, some more productive than others, some more interesting than others and none of which effect their coding prowess.</p>

              <p>Mage bot. No idea what it does but last version it was colour based and did some training arena. I don’t use it I just crack it so people don’t have to pay for it. Don’t worry its not cracked yet, looks like they’ve reversed every if statement there is. I’ll have to run it through my deober and make a if statement reverser now :(.

<p>The deob feature of ZKM can’t handle it when the return types of the methods are the only things that are different. This bot is a violation of the java specification but i doubt they care. I ran it through my own version which attempts to rename them the same way. ie. a.class is called Class1.class etc…</p>

              <p>Instrumentation is an interface to get the byte code and OPTIONALLY modify it. Everything comes through there. If I use pure byte code editing I have to edit everywhere and go out of my way to hook to get all the bytes I need. Optionally I can simply hook the methods of define class in ClassLoader through re transformation. But that requires effort so in order to use a little brain power, less hard yakka and get more reliability (perhaps I missed a class definiton/boloxed a edit?), I simply use the interface and with maybe 10-15 lines of code including headers/definitions/file writing and the manifest I can get everything on a silver platter.</p>

<p>Nobody should release source code that works here as there is a high probability that you’ll regret it when that same n00b ‘cracks’ your or somebody else’s auth system.</p>

<p>Now that I have instrumentation in my toolkit I don’t even need bytecode editing to hook the class definitions. Once on disk I can try and decompile and if that isn’t clean enough for me to waste my time fixing up I’ll simply use a basic bytecode editor.</p>
<p>HELL thats an idea: load the byte code in ASM (that is key - no indexes means simplicity) and put them into an array of AbstractInstNodes. Then put a debugger break point. Use your standard eclipse debugger to edit variables and text (remember the indexes have been expanded since we use ASM). Then in the program you roll them up from the array, skipping nulls since we could delete stuff, then dumping them to file. Poor man’s bytecode editor.</p>

<p>That is why it is also based upon the person’s ip address, hostname, and their copy of the bot would be slightly different for them compared to others. That way the checksum will be different and cannot be leaked.</p>

              <p>There is one inevitable thing that occurs no matter what type of protection you implement.  The bot code eventually is loaded into memory and runs, at that point you can dump it back to a file, and you have your stolen bot code.  Sure there may be protection in that as well, but thats just a matter of bytecode editing until you bypass everything you need.</p>
<p>If I can dig up my best Java protection, which I made a few years ago for BobDole’s RSC private server client, I’ll post it up to see how long it takes one of you to break it.  I already ran this test when I made it, and I think Bash and ruler (out of maybe 8 people) eventually defeated it.</p>
