    <description>Ok only Jad and the Kalphite Queen attack back on my server. I have Allstarscape source. Here is the code That I think makes it attack back:

[code]                                    if (npcs[i].npcType == 1158
                                            || npcs[i].npcType == 2745) {
                                        npcs[i].StartKilling = person.playerId;
                                        npcs[i].RandomWalk = false;
                                        npcs[i].IsUnderAttack = true;
                                    } else if (person.distanceToPoint(
                                            npcs[i].absX, npcs[i].absY)
                                                    &gt;= 21
                                                            || person.heightLevel
                                                                    != npcs[i].heightLevel) {
                                        if (npcs[i].npcType == 1158
                                                || npcs[i].npcType == 2745) {
                                            npcs[i].RandomWalk = true;
                                        }
                                    }
                                } 
                            }
                        }
                    }[/code]

1158 is Kalphite Queen and 2745 is Jad. I&#39;m guessing [code]npcs[i].StartKilling = person.playerId;[/code] makes it so it attacks you on its own and [code]pcs[i].IsUnderAttack = true;[/code] makes it so it attacks you back, but I don&#39;t know that for sure.

Now I added [code]|| npcs[i].npcType == 50[/code] to it because I wanted to test it out (50 is KBD). When I put it in there and updated it attacked back but it also would auto attack you, it would hit you without even being hit. And it would hit numbers like 50 and stuff..How do I make it so it doesn&#39;t automatically hit you on its own and how do I make it so it doesn&#39;t hit 50&#39;s on you? I think this is well-explained so someone please help me.</description>

<p>1158 is Kalphite Queen and 2745 is Jad. I’m guessing <code>npcs[i].StartKilling = person.playerId;</code> makes it so it attacks you on its own and <code>pcs[i].IsUnderAttack = true;</code> makes it so it attacks you back, but I don’t know that for sure.</p>

And it would hit numbers like 50 and stuff…How do I make it so it doesn’t automatically hit you on its own and how do I make it so it doesn’t hit 50’s on you?
