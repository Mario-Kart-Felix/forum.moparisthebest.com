    <title>Pk Point Exchange</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-point-exchange/294718</link>
    <description>Hi, I have the Pk system worked out. Like if you kill someone it will give you Pk Points.. But I wanna make a Pk shop.. For example, theres gonna be a AGS and lets say I wanna put it for exchange for 30k Pk Points. What will I do? Like I want it to be exchanged for 30k Pk Points.. Not 30k coins. Oh and I also want the Pk Points to be shown besides the combat level.

Oh and I&#39;m using Delta as a base. Thanks for you time. I appreciate it :)!</description>
