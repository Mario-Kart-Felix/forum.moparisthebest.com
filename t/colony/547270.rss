    <description>[b][size=14pt]Colony[/size][/b]
After a 2 year break from private servers, I thought I would start working on one again. My aim for the server is to follow after the current RuneScape Oldschool server, with other content that will make it unique at the same time. Development will be pretty slow for right now due to work, so I have no fixed date on when the server will be online.

              <p>Arham’s varrock was decently created. If the server had gained a bigger following then honestly it would have panned out well.</p>
<p>And I think tutorials about the server specifically are good, and if players are willing to take the time to learn about it then they should receive basically a reward for gaining knowledge about the server. The only reason I think something like the starter set should be awarded upon completion is that all too many times servers will begin to set up a good basis on what shops should be included and what tiers should be available, but then they offer a ridiculous start set with like 5 mill gp. That is the kind of stuff that destroys your economy from the beginning.</p>
<p>If you want to do a melee, ranger, magician starter pack thing then I really would suggest just giving them the basic gear to get started so they can do begin killing things for money, but none of that crap where people get iron, mithril, addy, runite gear off the get go. That’s just stupid.</p>

<p>Really bad. Results in a ton of quiting. We did this in Rome and made the home Taverley. Nearly nobody could find their way, even though the minimap had CLEAR ICONS of where everything was. Kiddies are clueless.</p>

If you wanted to go lore friendly or give a backstory, you could just do something like “You wake up from a night of heavy drinking in an unfamiliar tavern…” I think if you’re going to do a good starter kit then make the players at least go through some dialogue and maybe like a pseudo-quest. Make them learn the land.<br>

Yes, make tutorials not about basics but about the gameplay.</p>

</aside>
<p>It is arguable. I mean, if you make alot of the skills available in home, it does become a hub by itself. But then again, it probably IS too big. You COULD use the GE, but GE has like no support for skilling.</p>

<p>Nope, it looks organized. Just remember to utilize it more than often, because teleporting to a lot of areas to skill may seem like you’re utilizing the world but the players always seem to hate it.</p>

</aside>
<p>You need a central hub for players to be in, and that should typically be home. But, with the theme servers now-a-days go with, teleporting to every place in the map, there is no central hub at all…</p>
<p>[quote=“Ruby, post:50, topic:547270”]I mean, I used Edgeville until about 600 players then changed to Falador and quickly after to Al-Kharid.</p>
<p>A small home isn’t a bad thing to begin with, it keeps the community together. I just got lazy and didn’t change it. After about 200 online at one time Edge gets very busy and a pain in the ass so once you start hitting like a constant 100+ online I’d start looking for a new place if that’s what you’re finding.</p>
<p>It’s different to every server, it depends what the community looks for nowadays. For example, mines loved PvP. Edgeville was convenient for that and there was a bit of space to trade for those who liked to trade. It served me well. I wouldn’t go to something like Varrock or anything until a larger playerbase, like I said, usually 100-150 online at once is when I would start looking to transition.</p>
<p>Maybe make an attempt at using Seers or maybe even the Barbarian village?</p>
<p>Seers and the Barb would be nice for starting communities but will get very very crowded after about 50 people at once I reckon.[/quote]<br>

<p>Seers’ Village:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Support for 3 income-making skills (woodcutting, crafting, fishing)[/li]<br>

<p>Barbarian Village:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Support for like 3 skills (crafting, fishing, mining) (woodcutting too barely).[/li]<br>
[li]Cave entrance, perfect as a training area entrance.[/li]<br>
[li]Ongoing fire could be helpful[/li]<br>

<p>[hr]</p>
<p>To be honest, I love Varrock. It has everything you could possibly need and everybody knows their way around Varrock. Woodcutting, Fishing, Construction, Hunter, Mining, Prayer, all sorts of skills! Also, the center of Varrock is a perfect hub. There are shops everywhere. Varrock is also near Barbarian Village and the Wildy.</p>

Its an added benefit for having 99 in that skill. Now you can earn faster money.</p>
<p>For example, fishing. Now you can teleport to the fishing guild and start, instead of doing a big walk.</p>
