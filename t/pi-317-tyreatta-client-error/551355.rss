    <description>Hello there, I use eclipse and I just recently started working a little on tyreatta and I can&#39;t really run the client.
Running into an issue here... I saw at first that the cachedownloader isn&#39;t really working, so I fixed it. Now it&#39;s working fine but not unpacking, I also fixed it. Then, I just decided to unpack the Cache manually and place it in (users.home) where it&#39;s supposed to be...

Here&#39;s the error eclipse is giving me;
[CODE]
Error: loaderror Starting up 20
Exception in thread &quot;Thread-3&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException
	at client.cleanUpForQuit(client.java:5064)
	at RSApplet.exit(RSApplet.java:132)
	at RSApplet.run(RSApplet.java:126)
	at client.run(client.java:4846)
[/CODE]
Here&#39;s a picture of what the client shows up as.....
http://prntscr.com/71olq9

If anyone knows what&#39;s going on, please let me know... Thanks..</description>

<p>Looks like its having trouble unpacking/loading the cache. I never should have released it, its terrible and to be honest has a lot of bugs I never got around to fixing. Like this one, after a few times of manually downloading the cache (link in CacheDownloader.java) and unpacking to the correct location, it randomly worked. Honestly I wouldn’t bother with it. If you plan to start a project this release will give you a lot of trouble. Its also not fully protected against the Reflection cheat client.<br>
