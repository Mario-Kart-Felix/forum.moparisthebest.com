    <title>Changed Names of Client, now can&#39;t connect to server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changed-names-of-client-now-cant-connect-to-server/401472</link>
    <description>Alright, so i&#39;ve changed some names in the client.java of this client to my server name.
But after i had changed them all, it still won&#39;t let me connect to my server.
But before i changed them, it let me.

Does anybody know why?

I&#39;m getting a error connection to server, and even when i compile it, it says no errors..

Im using Int Dub Pk Client also.</description>
