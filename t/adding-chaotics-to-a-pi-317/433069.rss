    <title>Adding chaotics to a PI 317?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-chaotics-to-a-pi-317/433069</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m trying to add chaotics to my 317 project insanity, but I don&#39;t quite know how. I&#39;ve tried ripping some files from another PI just to test if that would work but that didn&#39;t..
I appreciate if someone could explain me how to do this. I heard you need to do stuff with .dat&#39;s and Ints, but that doesn&#39;t say alot to me.

Cheers</description>

<p>Also, as long as you use the correct coding and models it SHOULD WORK. Depending on what you are adding you might need to add a new model header for your client, which can be found in the tutorial section I’m sure.</p>
