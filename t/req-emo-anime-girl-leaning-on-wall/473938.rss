    <title>[REQ] Emo/Anime girl leaning on wall</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-emo-anime-girl-leaning-on-wall/473938</link>
    <description>So, apparently google/bing image search hates me. I&#39;m trying to find, or have someone make, a anime emo girl, that&#39;s leaning on what would appear to be a wall. I&#39;d rather the wall not be there, as I want to use it for my tumblr background. She&#39;d be leaning on the left hand side of the computer screen\browser. Thanks.

Colors: Dark, but aside from that, it doesn&#39;t matter. The background of my tumblr is black.
Other: cute please.</description>

So, apparently google/bing image search hates me. I’m trying to find, or have someone make, a anime emo girl, that’s leaning on what would appear to be a wall. I’d rather the wall not be there, as I want to use it for my tumblr background. She’d be leaning on the left hand side of the computer screen\browser. Thanks.<br>

Google ‘anime girl’.</p>
<p>I tried and my computer BSOD’d, maybe you’ll have better luck.[/quote]<br>
My god. Did you even care to read a god damn word I said?<br>
when I said “apparently google/bing image search hates me” That obviously meant I have looked around…</p>
