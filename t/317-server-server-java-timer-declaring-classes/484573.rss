    <title>317 Server: (server.java) - &quot;Timer&quot;/declaring classes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-server-server-java-timer-declaring-classes/484573</link>
    <description>Hello.

Before I go on to my questions/problems, I want you to bear in mind that this is my [b]very first topic[/b]!
It&#39;s also about a [b]317 server[/b].

Answers I am looking for:

[b]1: Cycle timer[/b]
[b]2: Defineing classes(?)[/b]

[b]Cycle timer:[/b]
As I am browsing my [b]server/source&#39;s[/b] &quot;server.java&quot;-file, some of the very first commands below all
the imports that I can&#39;t understand are about some sort of timeing...?
I have been taking a &quot;peek under the hood&quot; of some other servers, and some of them are using
&quot;Bluurr&#39;s sexy timer&quot; (or something like that).
If I&#39;m not [i]completely[/i] wrong, it has to do with determing how long the client listener&#39;s threads are
going to &quot;sleep&quot;, I take it?
What I want to know here is why these timers are here, and why I can&#39;t simply delete them...

[b]Defineing classes(?):[/b]
[i]This may be more of a question for Java than RSPS-related, but here I go[/i]:
Also in the [b]server/source&#39;s[/b] &quot;server.java&quot;-file, there are some other commands that catches my eyes.
Let me take an example... &quot;[b]GraphicsHandler = new GraphicsHandler();[/b]&quot;.
Yet again, if I&#39;m not wrong, it defines ([i]in this case[/i]) the &quot;GraphicsHandler.java&quot;-file to &quot;server.java&quot;.
But I am used to define classes in a little bit different way, like this:
&quot;[b]GraphicsHandler &lt;nickname&gt; = new GraphicsHandler();[/b]&quot;.
You then have to call the class by it&#39;s &quot;nickname&quot; when ever you are refering to it.

That&#39;s it.
[b]I do NOT claim to be a professor in english[/b].
[b]I do NOT claim to be a professor in Java[/b].
[b]I do NOT claim to be the most experienced RS/RSPS player/coder among us all[/b]...

Looking forward for feedback.</description>

<p>Ok, the usual RS cycle time is 600ms. Every 600ms the server and players are updated. However if you want to perform actions out-of-time (like you want to make a player do an emote once every 3000ms) we can use an event.</p>
<p>Yeah you should probably go read up on some java docs and begin to learn programming for yourself before approaching RSPS. Gl buddy</p>

              <p>I believe bluurs timer is just his version of cycles, events etc, and it depends what they are used for to whether you can delete them.</p>
<p>GraphicsHandler = new GraphicsHandler(); is used to define the class to server.java, there is no need to nickname it.</p>
