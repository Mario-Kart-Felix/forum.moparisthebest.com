    <title>Adding new Ranks to my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-new-ranks-to-my-server/455178</link>
    <description>I am trying to add some new ranks to my server, some examples would be:
Help mod
Trial Mod
Trial Admin

I have tried to google how to do it but nothing has came up, I am using a dspk based server.

Lets say that I wanted help mod to be Playerrights == 7 then trial mod == 8 then admin == 9 you get the point I am assuming,
How would I add special commands for those players? and make the custom yell?

I know how to make their own commands, and yell, but how do I add a mod sign next to their name while they talk regular? what file would that be in?
Thanks,
Jack</description>
