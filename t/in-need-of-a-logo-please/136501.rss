    <title>In need of a logo please =)</title>

    <description>Ok, I am in need of a new logo to go with my site lol

The name is SAMMS (Ski Area Maininance Managment Services) Its a registered buisness

Ok it needs to do with ski area&#39;s or mountains in someway, cant look really childish, or be too uber (has to look somewhat corperate)

The color scheme needs to follow the folowing colors:

Blue,Red,Black, and White

If anyone has free time and could possibly do this I WOULD LOVE U! You would probably save me anywhere from 100-400$ to get a professional to do it :/

Here is something i came up with just for insperation lol</description>
