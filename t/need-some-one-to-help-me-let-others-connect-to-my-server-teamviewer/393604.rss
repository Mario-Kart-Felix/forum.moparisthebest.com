even though you changed stuff for me i uploaded it to megaupload n downloaded it on brothers computer and it still wont let me conect to server on it. mabey you should go to <a href="http://kruntscape.ucoz.com" rel="nofollow noopener">kruntscape.ucoz.com</a>, forums, dl client, then if you can make it log into my server then you can help me fix.</p>
