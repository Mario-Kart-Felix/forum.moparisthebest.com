    <title>Client to Server help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-to-server-help/292763</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
I made a server and everything is fine and working, i can access it through moparscape client download and online, so can a friend on another computer.
My problem is that before I am going to post the server, i need a client for it.
I have many clients that I play, and i edited one of them, replacing the server IP with my server IP, but when I try and connect using the newly edited client, it logs in, but the playing screen is black, and then quickly logs me out again. Then when I try back on Mopar it works.... so it is not the server being nulled, it is something to do with the client or the client to server connection....
BTW: I have tried editing 2 clients and they both did not work :(
Please help :D

What am i doing wrong/need to change to be able to play through my new client???

Thanks.. :D</description>

              <p>Thanks for the suggestions, but I have tried the server on mopar and it worked fine, and this client is alot better then mopar <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
I have also tried another client…<br>
Anyone else got any ideas? Could it possibly be because I am the one hosting the server??<br>
BTW: The error message on the client cmd says:<br>
Error: Packet lost type 2, refreshing connection<br>
On the server cmd it says:<br>
(Player name) is signing onto the server.<br>
Loaded: 3<br>
Game saved for (Player name)<br>
ClientHandler: Client (Player name) disconnected[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 05, 2009, 02:26:46 pm[/size][hr]Found a way… mod please remove</p>

              <p>I know that my cousins would use the silab client to play…<br>
but when they go to certain areas of the map, they would lagg out.<br>
When they would log back in it would show the game frame but the screen would be black and it would say “loading please wait” until you restart the client.</p>
<p>This would probably happen if certain parts of the map were not supported by the client (highly doubt that).<br>
OR… If there was too much activity goin on in that certain area…<br>
(ex… Too many objects, too many people, or too many NPC’s… in that area)</p>
<p>What ever area you are in, try to clear it out some.<br>
If that doesnt work i would suggest using another client.</p>
