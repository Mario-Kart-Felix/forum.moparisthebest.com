    <title>Problem with coverting Mopar to Silab</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-coverting-mopar-to-silab/217317</link>
    <description>I have a Battlescape Blitz source, that I just downloaded. The problem, is that my server doesn&#39;t pick up the silab client items (Like the darkbow). Each tutorial I&#39;ve found hasn&#39;t worked for converting the server to read the models on the silab client, and after one of the few tutorials, I was unable to log in on my server. Does anyone know a way to enable reading of the silab models for my source? I would be greatful for any help I can get!</description>
