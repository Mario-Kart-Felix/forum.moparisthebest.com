    <description>I&#39;m planning to try to create a rsps so I searched around for sources and found runesource, pi and asteria. The source I&#39;m looking for should be stable and if possible have no skills as I&#39;m only making a server in order to learn so having as little as possible is nice. (sadly I lack the knowledge to start a server from scratch) Anyhow I&#39;m wondering what sources other people prefer.

Die please.<br>
Anything Trisidia or deathly pvpz you should <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> start with. Why? They’re terrible. All they will teach is poor programming habits.</p>
<p>PI is a really common one to start with, yes, but it’s arguably one of the worse servers because of how it was wrote.<br>
Apollo or Hyperion are better.</p>
<p>317 is one of the most documented revisions we have.</p>

              <p>Yes but imo 317 is too old, I’d go for 498 or something then. Ofcourse there’s alot more documentation for 317.</p>

<p>If I were you I would go for 508+ just because there’s more stuff to do and it’s a little better established. Also a little harder. So it’s all up to you.</p>
