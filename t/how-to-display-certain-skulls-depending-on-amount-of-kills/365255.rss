    <title>How to display certain skulls depending on amount of kills</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-display-certain-skulls-depending-on-amount-of-kills/365255</link>
    <description>Since I am not adding Bounty Hunter to my server, I would like to use the bounty hunter skulls to show how many kills a player has had. For instance

The Bronze Skull- Less than 10 kills
The Gray Skull- Between 10-50 kills
The Green Skull- Between 50-100 kills
The Blue Skull- Between 100-500 kills
The Red Skull- Above 500 kills

I&#39;m guessing I would have to do something similar to this:?

(Declare public int killskull)
[code]
if killskull &lt;10 (C:\Documents and Settings\Devon\Desktop\Bluescap3 Client Version 1\Files\Spirts\skull_brown.png)[/code]</description>
