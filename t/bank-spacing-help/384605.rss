    <title>Bank Spacing Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bank-spacing-help/384605</link>
    <description>I am new to RSPS coding and I am having a slight problem. I&#39;m not sure if this is my fault or its in the 317 itself. I can put items into my bank fine but when I close and come back it dosent move any items up the grid. The grid is just locked. If there is any solution please tell me what to do, the code, and where to put it! This would be gladly appreciated.
