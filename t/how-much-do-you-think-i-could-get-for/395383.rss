Just sold an Xbox 360 Elite with a 250 gb hard drive, 2 controllers, Red Dead Redemption, Beatles Rockband with the guitar &amp; drums, and a wireless adapter for $250.  So base your prices off that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  Honestly, I’d say about $300, $350 max.<br>
[/quote]you sold it on ebay/craigslist or to a store?[/quote]<br>
To a friend, and he was being generous :\  I wasn’t getting near $200 on craigslist, and the stores were giving me less than that.  So it all depends on who you sell it to.</p>

<p>Don’t rag on them too much. I brought in a shitload (like 10-15, so not really alot) of PSP games I had (made a ISO backup for each one on comp before doing this) and (if i wanted one) could have gotten a PS3, but instead I cashed in for a few pre-orders.

I have a 120GB in my Arcade (don’t rag, i got it for $150 as well as a few thrown-in games/such) and bought the elite HDD for $40 on Ebay. Anyways, back on topic, what size is your HDD? Most people won’t even want a 20GB, and some push away the 60GB (like me) even. My guess is, if you have a 20GB, around $200 max, with the 60GB, My guess is between 200-260. With the 120, prolly somewhere between $260-300. Of course, (like im doing atm) if you were to mod the HDD and install a 750GB, it would majorly increase all of that lmfao.<br>

<p>Don’t rag on them too much. I brought in a shitload (like 10-15, so not really alot) of PSP games I had (made a ISO backup for each one on comp before doing this) and (if i wanted one) could have gotten a PS3, but instead I cashed in for a few pre-orders. It really depends on the games though, I have brought in 5 games and only gotten $20 for them. As long as it wasn’t complete shit, you will get a decent enough sale, more than what you would get as a garage sale at least.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span> - The biggest price range is going to revolve around the size of the HDD. I have a 120GB in my Arcade (don’t rag, i got it for $150 as well as a few thrown-in games/such) and bought the elite HDD for $40 on Ebay. Anyways, back on topic, what size is your HDD? Most people won’t even want a 20GB, and some push away the 60GB (like me) even. My guess is, if you have a 20GB, around $200 max, with the 60GB, My guess is between 200-260. With the 120, prolly somewhere between $260-300. Of course, (like im doing atm) if you were to mod the HDD and install a 750GB, it would majorly increase all of that lmfao.<br>

PM me story?  Also, until it’s sold, we should play RDR together <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
