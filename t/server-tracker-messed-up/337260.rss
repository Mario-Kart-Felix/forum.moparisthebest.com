    <title>Server tracker messed up?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-tracker-messed-up/337260</link>
    <description>Wow, fuck sake. I was up since 4/09/2010 at 100 percent uptime, now I dropped to 99. It says server is currently offline, yet I&#39;m on server with 20 other people as we speak. Checked on Canyouseeme.org and port is open and accepting connections. What&#39;s up?</description>
