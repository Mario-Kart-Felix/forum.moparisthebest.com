    <description>I would like to know why Melissa locked this thread.  I see no point, I was having a discussion with Un-Named, I wasn&#39;t spamming.  It just leaves another unanswered question, thanks Melissa.  Just to make it clear btw, I had several posts on that thread and he also had some, replying to the people who needed help and answers.  Now they&#39;re deleted, which was even worse than locking it.</description>

<p>I mean, wtf?  What right does she have to lock it, just because she can doesn’t mean she can do it whenever she want’s.  She also deleted a thread I made a while ago arguing why the RS2 Server Advertisement Discussion thread was deleted.  Why would you do that?  Anyway, Un-Named left it open for a reason.  For discussion, which is now unavailable.  And the Moderators/Administrators wonder why there’s so much spam, people asking questions in the wrong section, because there is nowhere to ask them…</p>
