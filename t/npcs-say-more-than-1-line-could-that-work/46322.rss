    <description>Okay what I want to say is pretty long so I wanted to break it up into multiple text updates. For some reason he only says the second line....

else if (npcs[i].npcType == 1044)
{
if (misc.random2(20) &lt;= 3) //this is the time delay
{
npcs[i].updateRequired = true;
npcs[i].textUpdateRequired = true;
npcs[i].textUpdate = &quot;Go far north into the wilderness.&quot;;
npcs[i].textUpdate = &quot;There you will find a hollow tree..&quot;;
							}
						}

</aside>
<p>Oh,so since your saying I’m a retard,your saying my analysis is wrong.( well,basically ).So,if if you say my analysis is wrong,then whats moparscape?It is a private server,everyone knows that.If your saying moparscape isn’t based on a cache from runescape,WITCH IT IS,then what is it?</p>
<p>I was saying if moparscape is based on a cache on runescape and RS hasn’t developed the ability to talk in one then more line at a time.Itt doesn’t do that.I said it WAS possible to code it in.<br>
So,you’r saying I’m retarted because I’m wrong,well,frankly I’m not wrong.BECAUSE MOPARSCAPE IS A PRIVATE SERVER BASED OFF THE CACHE OF RUNESCAPE,BECAUSE,YOU SEE,IN ANY SERVER,IT CAN’T TALK IN MORE THEN 1 LINE @ A TIME.I SAID YOU COULD CODE IT IN.Everybodys saying to code it in on the good time or whatever.Also,you said it isn’t possible.It is possible,do what superbum1 said.BTW look at your signature,it says "</p><blockquote>DNT TLK LKE A RTRD CUZ TI MKES U LOK LKE ONE. "</blockquote>
<p>translation: Don’t talk like a retard because it makes you look like one.<br>
Im not talking like that.BAM.</p>
<p>I don’t know alot about coding.Im learning it. FFS<br>
CHEW ON THAT.</p>

<p>This is only a calculation I just done.If you go do alexia’s FAQ,it will say " What Is Moparscape"?<br>
It says “moparscape is a private server client that allows you to edit,share,and do whatever you want with a runescape server.Not everything works though,it is only a <span class="bbcode-b"> cache </span> based on Runescape,edited.”</p>
<p>So,they took the main chunk of rs,and made it editable etc.<br>
Since it’s based from the actuall Runescape client,and Runescape can’t like in more then 1 line in a time,I guess not.</p>
<p>But,since we can edit it,someone can find a code and make it that way.</p>
<p>EDIT: HOLY! I ACUALLY DID AN ANALYSIS! W000T! GO ME,IT’S MY B-DAY,OH YEA,OH YEA,UH-HUH.LOL.</p>

<p>^^ Why does that matter.</p>
<p>Also it’s possible, just copy the code. But you have to get timers spot on for it to work.</p>
<p><code>else if (npcs.npcType == 1044)
{
if (misc.random2(20) &lt;= 0) 
{
npcs.updateRequired = true;
npcs.textUpdateRequired = true;
npcs.textUpdate = "Go far north into the wilderness.";
                     }
                  }</code></p>
<p><code>else if (npcs.npcType == 1044)

npcs.textUpdate = "There you will find a hollow tree..";
                     }
                  }</code></p>
<p>I have no clue what the timers wluld be :s</p>
