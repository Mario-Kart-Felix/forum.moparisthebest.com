    <description>I just downloaded a torrent for LOTR:BFME, mounted it with Daemon tools, but it says to insert the correct CD. I went online and got sd4hider, didn&#39;t work. Tried CureROM, didn&#39;t work. Is there a place I can just get a simple no-cd patch/crack? I have spent hours on google with no luck. I would be VERY greatful if someone could help.</description>

              <p>Hmm, it turns out not to be a very fun game. I got the second one (damn thing is 5.44 GB), and it was better, but still not too great. Is there a castle games like that where you command troops, but you have to work on your castle, gathering resources for a few weeks instead of like 30 minutes? Like those old fish tank games where you raise fish, but for a castle + army + battles etc.?</p>

              <p>Go to <a href="http://gamecopyworld.com" rel="nofollow noopener">gamecopyworld.com</a> and get the mini image (or whatever its called)…its about 5mb and you mount it with daemon tools.  Worked fine for me when I tried it out (although I borrowed it from a friend…shouldn’t make a difference though.) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Computer games are often not even locked up(Although console games are). At walmart/other department stores it is harder to run away because the exit is much futhur. But at Staples they have lots of comuter games/accessories… Grab them and run, its very easy. That being said, I would never do it to a local shop, or a small business(they struggle to survive).</p>

<p>I’ve stolen from Staples countless times. You can either open the box very carefully, or if your in a different town(or in a huge city) take it and run. If you think a 16 year old girl at the countr is going to chase after you then…</p>
