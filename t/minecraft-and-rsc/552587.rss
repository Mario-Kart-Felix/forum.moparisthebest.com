    <title>Minecraft and rsc?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/minecraft-and-rsc/552587</link>
    <description>ok, i had an idea about a randomly generated landscaoe for rsc. the game would be single player, and would be randmly generated. you would get rid of all skills but attack, hp, and defense, ect. and remove requirnments to use items. you would obtain items from drops, crafting, mining, ect. single player for pc/ios/android.

new monsters, items, rares and such.

total awsomeness.</description>

              <p>Procedural generation is just fine. I just don’t see why he bothered to mention ios/android. Only 1 server has bothered to attempt at it and we have known all along that rsc does not go well with it. It’s like playing pac man or galaga on your pc, just go to the arcade. Then he mentioned new monsters… there are only a handful of servers have ever bothered to implement new sprites and that’s a bitch to get correct.</p>

              <p>sounds interesting, but imo the mechanics of runescape are too intricate and scripted for procedural generation to work well</p>
