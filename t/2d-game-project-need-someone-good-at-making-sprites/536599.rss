    <title>2D Game Project Need Someone good at making Sprites</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2d-game-project-need-someone-good-at-making-sprites/536599</link>
    <description>Hello I&#39;m working on making a 2D runescape based game sorta like how minicraft is to minecraft but instead like miniscape or something. I&#39;m not the best at making sprites, and i really need some good quality sprites. I&#39;m looking for someone who i can give a design of a npc or background or anything and they can make a 2D pixelated version.</description>

Ooo thank you I just looked up spine i think it will help a lot. Of course gots to pay for it ;] but if i just use snap shots then maybe i can just use the trial version? not sure but do you know of any free software like spine? and also you think the whole snap shots of 3D models instead of drawing pixels out is a good idea?</p>

<p>Well with limited resources, it’s really effective. I don’t know any freeware version of spine, in fact spine is pretty exclusive by itself. I know of games that use similar technology, but that’s going to be proprietary. I would love to write something like spine myself, but I doubt I’d have time for that. Tis a shame.</p>

<p>MoparScape Modeling Contest Winner 3D modeling section I won last year.</p>
<p>And actually ive been thinking up a new way to do this, i’m going to take 3d models because thats what im good at and separate each piece of the character as in arms, legs, head etc. and im going to screen shot them from the angle i need and move them accordingly to what i want and make different frames for the animations of characters. then for the background i’ll probably do the same thing a 3D background but its a picture rather then actually being there? whats yalls thoughts and opinions of this?</p>

<p>thanks for the link, but yea i want to make my own sprites though so that im not copying other peoples work ya know? do you know anyone who might be willing to help me?[/quote]The link I gave you has a large amount of free game sprites. The arists have put up their work under free licenses, allowing people to use them without paying them or infrigning copyrights. It’s going to be rather difficult to find talented artists willing to make specific sprites for your game when aren’t going to pay them.</p>

              <p>Hello I’m working on making a 2D runescape based game sorta like how minicraft is to minecraft but instead like miniscape or something. I’m not the best at making sprites, and i really need some good quality sprites. I’m looking for someone who i can give a design of a npc or background or anything and they can make a 2D pixelated version.</p>
