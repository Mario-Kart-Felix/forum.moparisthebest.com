    <description>[b]So i got an SYI bot on my server, i cant edit anything till it goes away. hopefully soon, because V2 isn&#39;t going to come by itself. The stupid thing has been going on for like 15 minutes now.. =.=

Anyways... Ill just tell you guys through here what I did so far, related to V2. along with posting the pictures through replies on the V1 page in the Downloads section.[/b]

[b]I can&#39;t get any pictures yet of the latest updates I&#39;m completing, the Agility area and the New mining area, because of the SYI bots on the server... Sooo here&#39;s what&#39;s up.[/b]

[size=14pt][b]&lt;==MINING==&gt;[/b][/size]
[b]
So I made the new skills area last week, and its working out as good as i thought. But one of the few things i didnt like about the way some skills were performed was mining. AllstarScape V2 used Gem rocks (the purple ones) and i decided to make mining with more variation. I put the original rocks in there. tin, copper, iron, etc. And  once you are a high enough level to mine coal, you have access the Reapagescape Miners guild. I guess thats a good name to call it. You go down through a trapdoor in the skills area to get there. You need the required mining level. When you have the ability to get into the mining guild you have access to more rocks, like coal, mithril, addy, and runite. I&#39;m also putting NPCs down there, that drop more new items.[/b]

[size=14pt][b]&lt;==AGILITY==&gt;[/b][/size]

[b]The agility i had on V1 wasn&#39;t very... well, it was boring.. So I brought back the wilderness agility, I have a portal in the skills area that takes you there. Its safe, so no PKing there. really nothing much to explain about it.

Heres the links to view the pictures of the updates i made so far. REMEMBER YOU CAN&#39;T DOWNLOAD THE UPDATES, these are just preview pictures of what V2 will feature.[/b]

              <p>Erm, sorry i didn’t think of that soon enough. maybe i should go back, change the portal to an NPC, and when i give credits out ill be sure to put you down, mega kudos for you. It just sort of funny, how something that small can give you the right to criticize me with a “fail”.</p>
<p>does it bother you that much that i have a portal instead of an npc?..</p>

              <p>nice i used v1 and edited a little like pk areas such as ::mpk which is alot of peoples favorite pk area, i have never seen it in any other server. the only same pk area on tabs is pk box. your first source was great this one looks even better. mabey you remember it?? you were on it once.</p>
<p>if you want to see what i have edited go to mclovinscape.tk and go to updates section its kind of empty now, becuase i cant play my own server so i dont turn on, becuase someone wont tell me whats with my silab client, if you know alot about silabs go to “PLEASE READ NOW ITS AN EASY QUESTION!” its on first page at the moment</p>
