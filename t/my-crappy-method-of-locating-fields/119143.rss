    <title>My crappy method of locating fields</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-crappy-method-of-locating-fields/119143</link>
    <description>I know my method sucks, but it works for some fields. This is how i found player energy.

1. You will need the following:

[ul][li]The latest runescape deob with batch files and vars.txt ([url=http://www.speljohan.net/downloads/Deob Related/ChangeLog.txt]Download Here[/url])[/li]
[li]My Printer class ([url=http://www.speljohan.net/downloads/Deob Related/Printer.java]Download Here[/url])[/li]
[li]My variable lister ([url=http://www.speljohan.net/downloads/DeobRelated/VarLister.rar]Download Here[/url])[/li]
[li]A changelog ([url=http://www.speljohan.net/downloads/Deob%20Related/ChangeLog.txt]Download Here[/url])[/li][/ul]


Now, before you start flaming me for using vb.net as the language for the variable lister, i want you to know i did it out of sheer laziness.

2. Open the variable lister, select the path where you extracted the deob, press &quot;Get Variables&quot;.

3. Press &quot;Copy to Clipboard&quot; and put all these lines in the commented section of Printer.java.

4. If you haven&#39;t already, put the Printer.java file where your deob is.

5. Now, let&#39;s set up a key event in the rs deob (note, this is already done in the included deob. At the current deob (461), open up Class60.java and locate the method &quot;keyPressed&quot;.  Under the following line:
[code]	    int i = keyevent.getKeyCode();[/code]
input the following:
[code]	    if(i == 112) {
	    Printer print = new Printer();
	    print.outputVariables();
	    }[/code]

Now compile and run the deob with the batch files. Whenever you feel like it, press F1 to output a list of all the client integer variables into the vars.txt file.

So, how could you use this? Well, you could identify fields using this if you think logically. Say, we want the player energy. The player energy is an integer, so first be sure what your energy is. In this case, let&#39;s say it&#39;s 100%. So, output the file with F1 and search for &quot;:100&quot; (without quotes) to find any variable with the value 100. When you find one, write the name of it down. Now, go back in game and run a bit. Let&#39;s say your energy is now 83%, so now dump another file with F1. Check the variable you wrote down and see if it&#39;s value has changed from 100 to 83. It changed? Great, you have identified a field.
Now all you gotta do is use the ChangeLog to change the deobfuscated name to the obfuscated name.
By using this method you could identify some variables in the game with ease. But then, it not a good way of doing it. Still better than doing nothing at all.</description>
