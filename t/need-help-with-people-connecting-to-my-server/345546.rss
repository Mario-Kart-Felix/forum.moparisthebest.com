    <title>Need help with people connecting to my server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-people-connecting-to-my-server/345546</link>
    <description>For some reason people can&#39;t connect to my server.  I edited the client files and changed the IP to my no-ip address (I also tried a static IP that I port forwarded to) and they still can&#39;t connect.  I also compiled and sent them the new client, but no luck.  Am I doing this right?  Can someone add me on MSN and help me using Team viewer???</description>
