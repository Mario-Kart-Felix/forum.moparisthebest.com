<p>Do you just have a problem getting comfortable talking to her? Like making it so it isn’t awkward?</p>

</aside>
<p>I can make a comment and she can reply, but I prefer it when the girl does all of the talking :p. I just can’t find anything to say in the right scenario to get to know more about her and not sound like I’m being a super try hard flirt all in the same moment.</p>

<p>next to her for 45 mins at varsity football game<br>
make some small talk<br>
still suck at conversation<br>
waste of opportunity<br>
she leaves, comes back<br>
her friend (and mine since 6th grade) standing next to me, we joke around like normal<br>
convinced girl I like is only person I can’t talk to</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I got like 4 tiny conversations in with her. I started 3 of them, and 1 of them was because I almost fell off the bleachers.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well these moments happen more then once so next time it happens take advantage of it by talking about something simple like wherethe next XC meet is, or her plans for the weekend. Things like those are good conversation starters unless she replies with one or two words. That probably won’t happen though because by the looks of things he has atleast a small interest in you.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m trying to not talk about school related / XC related things, and if I ask about the weekend she’ll probably think I’m about to ask her on a date…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well not necessarily, she would probably think that if she knew that you like her. You said she probably did so there is still a chance that she doesn’t know yet. You could also try asking her stuff like if she has any pets or sibilings if you don’t already know that.<br>
[/quote]<br>
She has a sister on the XC team and her parents had their dog @ practice when picking her up one day. :p[/quote]<br>
Any other sisters/brothers, what kind of dog. Or you could ask her if she read a good book recently, or if she draws outside of math class like you said earlier.</p>

I mean sure he could ask her out on Monday and she could say yes, but the relationship could be really awkward and it could not last long. Doing it the way he is takes away the awkward part of the relationship and could make it last longer because he would know more about her.</p>

<p>No, but I’m gonna see if I can get my friend Nick or Garrett to ride me around. Before Nick could drive he gave Garrett a ride to pick up his GF, so I can probably get one of them to do it for me.</p>
