<p>Also, since this is all about advice, I need some as well. Currently me and my girlfriend are taking a break from our 3 year+ relationship. She says she doesn’t want to be so serious so young in life and she wants to see who else is out there while she can. She says she will most likely come back to me but frankly this scenario has occurred more than once. I’m actually quite fed up with it. She set the facebook relationship to “it’s complicated” and I thought that was completely retarded after I confirmed that we were actually officially broken up. So… what should I do? I’ve already got my mind set on leaving her as she is without giving her another chance because after everything I do for her and to keep her happy (and trust me, this is a lot!) she still is insecure about our relationship and where it would go in the future. Should I completely break it off or just wait til she wants to get back with me? It really sounds to me like this would occur frequently even after High School.[/quote]</p>
<p>She’s deciding this after 3 years? It sounds odd to me, breaking up with you to date other guys, and if she doesn’t like them, she’ll come back to you. I wouldn’t accept her back if that’s what she’s trying to do.</p>

Well, let’s say she does know you like her.  If she hasn’t been pushing you away, or trying to avoid you, then that may mean she likes you back and is waiting for you to bust a move.</p>

I can make a comment and she can reply, but I prefer it when the girl does all of the talking :p. I just can’t find anything to say in the right scenario to get to know more about her and not sound like I’m being a super try hard flirt all in the same moment.</p>

That was pretty much the point of this topic. I had a HUGE chance here and failed epically:</p>
<p>[quote=“reyx7, post:442, topic:414624”]&gt;next to her for 45 mins at varsity football game</p>
<blockquote>
<p>make some small talk<br>
still suck at conversation<br>
waste of opportunity<br>
she leaves, comes back<br>
her friend (and mine since 6th grade) standing next to me, we joke around like normal<br>
convinced girl I like is only person I can’t talk to[/quote]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got like 4 tiny conversations in with her. I started 3 of them, and 1 of them was because I almost fell off the bleachers.</p>

<p>I can make a comment and she can reply, but I prefer it when the girl does all of the talking :p. I just can’t find anything to say in the right scenario to get to know more about her and not sound like I’m being a super try hard flirt all in the same moment.</p>

Well these moments happen more then once so next time it happens take advantage of it by talking about something simple like wherethe next XC meet is, or her plans for the weekend. Things like those are good conversation starters unless she replies with one or two words. That probably won’t happen though because by the looks of things he has atleast a small interest in you.</p>

Well not necessarily, she would probably think that if she knew that you like her. You said she probably did so there is still a chance that she doesn’t know yet. You could also try asking her stuff like if she has any pets or sibilings if you don’t already know that.</p>
