<p>Every havok server dies. Can’t really say much about that. It is how its designed. RoA was not a fail, as I was not part of the project looking on it, they did something the scene has never done before and they actually did what they wanted to do. You have about 20 threads in this section about “Server ideas” yet nobody takes them up and actually follows up on them. RoA actually did it. It was something different and unique. I would not call it a fail. Last Stand was not ran my mapu. I guess you can say me. Your point is invalid. Buggy != lack of players as many of the early servers would have a few to nearly 0 players. In all, all 3-4 projects have been for fun. Everything that they/we/I wanted to accomplish we accomplished. Lets see what you can do?[/quote]</p>
<p>Havok was designed to fail… Alright. Lmfao.</p>
<p>Twist it however you want in your mind lol. Facts are facts; Those projects were fail.<br>
ROA had nothing significant lol. Why are you trying to act like it was so great? Name some stuff that stuck out that no one has done before.</p>

That has to be some of the most ass backwards logic I have ever seen. I don’t think anyone will agree with the sentiment that RSCDaemon or the original Stork were fail servers.</p>
<p>The only fail here is the incessant bitch fits you (and people like Intoxication) engage in constantly. It’s like you guys are always on your menstrual period or are just consistently angry at life because your mom didn’t get you hot pockets from the grocery to satisfy your overweight hungers.</p>

<p>Every havok server dies. Can’t really say much about that. It is how its designed.

I would not call it a fail. Last Stand was not ran my mapu. I guess you can say me. Your point is invalid. Buggy != lack of players as many of the early servers would have a few to nearly 0 players.

<p>Even if I go with those false pretenses, anything that Intoxication or myself has done doesn’t change that the projects failed; they are mutually exclusive.  So, saying, “Lets see what you can do?” is completely irrelevant, and just a tactic to shift the attention away from your failures.</p>
<p>To claim servers that are no longer around didn’t fail is completely ridiculous.  By virtue of them not running to this date means they failed.<br>

That has to be some of the most ass backwards logic I have ever seen. I don’t think anyone will agree with the sentiment that RSCDaemon or the original Stork were fail servers.</p>
<p>The only fail here is the incessant bitch fits you (and people like Intoxication) engage in constantly. It’s like you guys are always on your menstrual period or are just consistently angry at life because your mom didn’t get you hot pockets from the grocery to satisfy your overweight hungers.[/quote]</p>
<p>Technically they did fail, hence they aren’t standing. The reasoning behind the failure of those servers are different than ROA.</p>
<p>I only read “the only fail here is the” and stopped. Blah blah blah, no one gives 2 shits bud.</p>

        <p>There is not going to be a private server that everybody likes, no matter how much people argues here.<br>
There is only going to be projects, and everyone of them is going to die in matter of time.</p>
<p>The fact is, you don’t have to create something amazing or complete different to make a “good” server.<br>
As been said many times before, people plays or played rsc because they liked it like it was.<br>
Every project (Including Havok, Last Stand and RoA) has teached us something.</p>
<p>I don’t post here much, because this community is the worst I’ve ever seen.<br>
People here should stop arguing and fighting against each others. If you don’t like somebody, you don’t have to show it to everybody, its annoying to read. Do some cooperation and make compromises or it will stay like this for ever.</p>
<p>Somebody should create an versatile poll with a lot of questions/answers about what do they want from a private RSC server.</p>

<p>It’s not backwards; it’s correct.  If you wish, put it into truth tables.  Also, just because idiots don’t want to face facts doesn’t make it any less of a failure.</p>
<p>BTW personal attacks do not get progress the argument, so I’m not going to respond to them from this point on (in this thread).</p>

<p>I’ve seen many of your posts and their just pointless.The paragraph which you wrote show’s that you aren’t good at programmming.</p>
<p>You should join a community instead of making one,or wait till you learnt how to develop.<br>
Impulse Revolution (My Server,which is STILL developing since 12/10) took ages before we were ready to start off with developing,I also took Computer Studies and learnt Java Scripts which helped me A LOT when developing IR.<br>
THEN,after having experience in programming I showed off my hard work and some developers liked it.They decided to join my Community and yet we made a great team out of IR.</p>
<p>This show’s that without experience your not good at ANYTHING when it comes to developing (unless you coded something small).</p>
<p>Face it,your just not good enough.You can keep denying,but sooner or later you will have to cut the line.</p>

<p>OH,OH HELL NO!</p>
<p>So you think…you think your bloody well special and better then the other developers!?<br>
Listen to yourself,you barely know what your saying!</p>
<p>Oh,just a small notice why you are a complete retard.</p>
<blockquote>Please find one comment on the entire internet that shows me stating that I program or code, I will give you a gold star and a pat on the back.</blockquote>
<p>I ment on your Thread you smart ass.</p>
<p>Most servers DON’T run poorly,the only way you describe poorly is a server which you find it as a showoff.</p>
<blockquote>Look at moparscape, it's a joke of a community. Maybe the admins can develop but in terms of running a community, well look at this section. It's sad really...</blockquote>
<p>After what I read what you typed in,I’m not surprised on how many people brag about Moparscape.If you think Moparscape is a joke for a community,find one which you think of it as “A Successful Community”</p>

You’re an idiot. “learnt Java Script” do you use that to program your servers?<br>
