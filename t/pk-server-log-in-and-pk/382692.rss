    <title>Pk server (log in and pk)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-server-log-in-and-pk/382692</link>
    <description>Hey.

Whilst we were still under development for our main server I thought I would host the old Havok server we ran a while ago. The general idea is you log in, can set your stats to whatever you want and can change them at any time (outside of the wild). When you pk somebody you get 2 points. When you die you lose 1 point. Use points to buy items from the shop.

I&#39;d like to survey a few of you so we can adjust it to suit the majority.

P2P/F2P:
Area&#39;s of wild you prefer pking:
Do you prefer special (custom) items/pots/food, Y/N:
Is there anything you could add to the server outlay that you think would improve it?

This server will be purely recreational, meaning our development will be limited and attention to detail will be minimal. If you get bored, don&#39;t whinge to us about it. This is for those who want to take a load of and get pking without the time investment.</description>

You’re an idiot. “learnt Java Script” do you use that to program your servers?<br>

<p>I ment on your Thread you smart ass.</p>
<p>Most servers DON’T run poorly,the only way you describe poorly is a server which you find it as a showoff.</p>

<p>After what I read what you typed in,I’m not surprised on how many people brag about Moparscape.If you think Moparscape is a joke for a community,find one which you think of it as “A Successful Community”</p>

<p>Every havok server dies. Can’t really say much about that. It is how its designed. RoA was not a fail, as I was not part of the project looking on it, they did something the scene has never done before and they actually did what they wanted to do. You have about 20 threads in this section about “Server ideas” yet nobody takes them up and actually follows up on them. RoA actually did it. It was something different and unique. I would not call it a fail. Last Stand was not ran my mapu. I guess you can say me. Your point is invalid. Buggy != lack of players as many of the early servers would have a few to nearly 0 players. In all, all 3-4 projects have been for fun. Everything that they/we/I wanted to accomplish we accomplished. Lets see what you can do?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Even if I go with those false pretenses, anything that Intoxication or myself has done doesn’t change that the projects failed; they are mutually exclusive.  So, saying, “Lets see what you can do?” is completely irrelevant, and just a tactic to shift the attention away from your failures.</p>
<p>To claim servers that are no longer around didn’t fail is completely ridiculous.  By virtue of them not running to this date means they failed.<br>
[/quote]<br>
That has to be some of the most ass backwards logic I have ever seen. I don’t think anyone will agree with the sentiment that RSCDaemon or the original Stork were fail servers.</p>
<p>The only fail here is the incessant bitch fits you (and people like Intoxication) engage in constantly. It’s like you guys are always on your menstrual period or are just consistently angry at life because your mom didn’t get you hot pockets from the grocery to satisfy your overweight hungers.[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s not backwards; it’s correct.  If you wish, put it into truth tables.  Also, just because idiots don’t want to face facts doesn’t make it any less of a failure.</p>
<p>BTW personal attacks do not get progress the argument, so I’m not going to respond to them from this point on (in this thread).</p>

<p>I don’t post here much, because this community is the worst I’ve ever seen.<br>
People here should stop arguing and fighting against each others. If you don’t like somebody, you don’t have to show it to everybody, its annoying to read. Do some cooperation and make compromises or it will stay like this for ever.</p>
<p>Somebody should create an versatile poll with a lot of questions/answers about what do they want from a private RSC server.</p>
<p>Sorry for my bad grammar and stuff, english is not my native language.</p>

<p>Technically they did fail, hence they aren’t standing. The reasoning behind the failure of those servers are different than ROA.</p>

<p>A long, long time ago…<br>
I can still remember<br>
How that music used to make me smile.<br>
And I knew if I had my chance<br>
That I could make those people dance<br>
And, maybe, they’d be happy for a while.</p>
<p>But february made me shiver<br>
With every paper I’d deliver.<br>
Bad news on the doorstep;<br>
I couldn’t take one more step.</p>
<p>I can’t remember if I cried<br>
When I read about his widowed bride,<br>
But something touched me deep inside<br>
The day the music died.</p>
<p>So bye-bye, miss american pie.<br>
Drove my chevy to the levee,<br>
But the levee was dry.<br>
And them good old boys were drinkin’ whiskey and rye<br>
Singin’, "this’ll be the day that I die.<br>
“this’ll be the day that I die.”</p>
<p>Did you write the book of love,<br>
And do you have faith in God above,<br>
If the Bible tells you so?<br>
Do you believe in rock ’n roll,<br>
Can music save your mortal soul,<br>
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?</p>
<p>Well, I know that you’re in love with him<br>
`cause I saw you dancin’ in the gym.<br>
You both kicked off your shoes.<br>
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues.</p>
<p>I was a lonely teenage broncin’ buck<br>
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck,<br>
But I knew I was out of luck<br>
The day the music died.</p>
<p>I started singin’,<br>
“bye-bye, miss american pie.”<br>
Drove my chevy to the levee,<br>
But the levee was dry.<br>
Them good old boys were drinkin’ whiskey and rye<br>
And singin’, "this’ll be the day that I die.<br>
“this’ll be the day that I die.”</p>
<p>Now for ten years we’ve been on our own<br>
And moss grows fat on a rollin’ stone,<br>
But that’s not how it used to be.<br>
When the jester sang for the king and queen,<br>
In a coat he borrowed from james dean<br>
And a voice that came from you and me,</p>
<p>Oh, and while the king was looking down,<br>
The jester stole his thorny crown.<br>
The courtroom was adjourned;<br>
No verdict was returned.<br>
And while lennon read a book of marx,<br>
The quartet practiced in the park,<br>
And we sang dirges in the dark<br>
The day the music died.</p>
<p>We were singing,<br>
“bye-bye, miss american pie.”<br>
Drove my chevy to the levee,<br>
But the levee was dry.<br>
Them good old boys were drinkin’ whiskey and rye<br>
And singin’, "this’ll be the day that I die.<br>
“this’ll be the day that I die.”</p>
<p>Helter skelter in a summer swelter.<br>
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter,<br>
Eight miles high and falling fast.<br>
It landed foul on the grass.<br>
The players tried for a forward pass,<br>
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast.</p>
<p>Now the half-time air was sweet perfume<br>
While the sergeants played a marching tune.<br>
We all got up to dance,<br>
Oh, but we never got the chance!<br>
`cause the players tried to take the field;<br>
The marching band refused to yield.<br>
Do you recall what was revealed<br>
The day the music died?</p>
<p>We started singing,<br>
“bye-bye, miss american pie.”<br>
Drove my chevy to the levee,<br>
But the levee was dry.<br>
Them good old boys were drinkin’ whiskey and rye<br>
And singin’, "this’ll be the day that I die.<br>
“this’ll be the day that I die.”</p>
<p>Oh, and there we were all in one place,<br>
A generation lost in space<br>
With no time left to start again.<br>
So come on: jack be nimble, jack be quick!<br>
Jack flash sat on a candlestick<br>
Cause fire is the devil’s only friend.</p>
<p>Oh, and as I watched him on the stage<br>
My hands were clenched in fists of rage.<br>
No angel born in hell<br>
Could break that satan’s spell.<br>
And as the flames climbed high into the night<br>
To light the sacrificial rite,<br>
I saw satan laughing with delight<br>
The day the music died</p>
<p>He was singing,<br>
“bye-bye, miss american pie.”<br>
Drove my chevy to the levee,<br>
But the levee was dry.<br>
Them good old boys were drinkin’ whiskey and rye<br>
And singin’, "this’ll be the day that I die.<br>
“this’ll be the day that I die.”</p>
<p>I met a girl who sang the blues<br>
And I asked her for some happy news,<br>
But she just smiled and turned away.<br>
I went down to the sacred store<br>
Where I’d heard the music years before,<br>
But the man there said the music wouldn’t play.</p>
<p>And in the streets: the children screamed,<br>
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed.<br>
But not a word was spoken;<br>
The church bells all were broken.<br>
And the three men I admire most:<br>
The father, son, and the holy ghost,<br>
They caught the last train for the coast<br>
The day the music died.</p>
<p>And they were singing,<br>
“bye-bye, miss american pie.”<br>
Drove my chevy to the levee,<br>
But the levee was dry.<br>
And them good old boys were drinkin’ whiskey and rye<br>
Singin’, "this’ll be the day that I die.<br>
“this’ll be the day that I die.”</p>
<p>They were singing,<br>
“bye-bye, miss american pie.”<br>
Drove my chevy to the levee,<br>
But the levee was dry.<br>
Them good old boys were drinkin’ whiskey and rye<br>
Singin’, “this’ll be the day that I die.”</p>
<p>Every havok server dies. Can’t really say much about that. It is how its designed. RoA was not a fail, as I was not part of the project looking on it, they did something the scene has never done before and they actually did what they wanted to do. You have about 20 threads in this section about “Server ideas” yet nobody takes them up and actually follows up on them. RoA actually did it. It was something different and unique. I would not call it a fail. Last Stand was not ran my mapu. I guess you can say me. Your point is invalid. Buggy != lack of players as many of the early servers would have a few to nearly 0 players. In all, all 3-4 projects have been for fun. Everything that they/we/I wanted to accomplish we accomplished. Lets see what you can do?</p>

<li>Havok died from lack of players – Failed.</li>
<li>ROA got destroyed – Failed.</li>
<li>Last Stand has a bad name and also is buggy which resulted in lack of players. – Failed.</li>

<p>Deny it all you want. Every project you’ve been on has failed.</p>

<p>I’ve ran two servers. What made them fail?</p>
<p>Oldschool (renamed to havok).  Had good popularity, once we put it up a week into things and somebody put up another server as an exact imitation. Half the players were between the two servers. From then onward people have been wanting/making copies of that server.</p>
<p>If people copy your server, i’m sure that means it’s not fail.</p>
<p>Second server was ROA. Tewl advised if we went over 15 players online he would ddos it, and he did. We ended up shutting it off as we couldn’t afford DDOS protection.</p>
