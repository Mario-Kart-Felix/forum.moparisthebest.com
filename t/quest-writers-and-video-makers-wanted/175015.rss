              <p>Name: Ashes<br>
Age: 16<br>
Job: Quest Writer/Video Maker (Doesn’t matter)<br>
Experience: When i was alittle younger, I was the ultimate nerd and wrote quests for a game i was wanting to make…=O but (obviously) I never made the game (didn’t really understand everything), and I just trashed the papers…plus I made a few Youtube vids of Runescape, mainly level 99’s for some of my friends.<br>
so i got a little bit of exp. for both.</p>
