    <description>This is the story.
I wanted to make a new teleport command and remove and add a few commands and I did and I noticed i have another client.java in the folder Data.
So I update both client.java&#39;s and i compile and then i log in and test out the new stuff and it dose not work!
It used to work so if i updated things and compiled but now it dose not :confused:!
So can you please tell me how to fix the problem i know its vague but i hope its enough info if it isn&#39;t replay back and ask for more info.</description>

<p>You only need 1. And you can also only use one.</p>
