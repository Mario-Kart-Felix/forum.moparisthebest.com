    <description>Remove all items from equipment then have them drop?

I was looking around and since I know players drop bones which is 526 I&quot;m just wondering is this the area where players are suppose to drop items?

[code]		if(playerItems[rr] &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; playerItems[rr] &lt; 11999) {
//createItem(currentX,currentY,playerItems[rr]-1);
			replaceBarrows();
			//server.checkPlayerCapes.checkDrop(this);
			ItemHandler.addItem(playerItems[rr]-1, absX, absY, playerItemsN[rr], KillerId, false);
                        //createGroundItem(playerItems[rr]-1, absX, absY, playerItemsN[i]);
			deleteItem(playerItems[rr]-1, getItemSlot(playerItems[rr]-1), playerItemsN[rr]); 
		}
	} catch(Exception e) {  }
}
		try {

		} catch(Exception e) {}
			ItemHandler.addItem(526, absX, absY, 1, KillerId, false);
		try {
		} catch(Exception e) {}
        if (itemKept1 &gt; 0)
            addItem(itemKept1, 1);
        if (itemKept2 &gt; 0)
            addItem(itemKept2, 1);
        if (itemKept3 &gt; 0)
            addItem(itemKept3, 1);
        if (itemKept4 &gt; 0)
            addItem(itemKept4, 1);
	if (keep6570) {
	    addItem(6570, 1);
	    keep6570 = false;
	}
	
			resetKeepItem();
			hitDiff = 0;	
			updateRequired = true; appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
		}[/code]

I looked up 526 which is bones and saw this
[code]ItemHandler.addItem(526, absX, absY, 1, KillerId, false);[/code]

and wondering how would i add all items to be drop?  the problem is with the newly added items, but after doing some work at lumbridge I notice not all items drop on death for example &quot;bronze armor and weapons.&quot;  Yet in the pvp place my fury was droping on death and on death by npc, so i looked up the fury and all i could find is that item.java where it goes into the necklace slot which didn&#39;t really help me at all.  Now I didn&#39;t place this in &quot;client help&quot; or &quot;server help&quot; because I have no clue what the problem is and really confused on whats going on here.  

Can someone please explain to me what is happening on my server/client?</description>

<p>lol but why would my amulet of fury drop, yet not the other items?</p>
<p>[quote=“Sup22211, post:3, topic:515892”]for(int i = 0; i &lt; playerItems.length; i++){<br>
ItemHandler.addItem(playerItems[i], absX, absY, playerItemsN[i], killerId, false);<br>
}<br>
If you only want the items to drop this should work[/quote]<br>
Where exactly would I put this?</p>
