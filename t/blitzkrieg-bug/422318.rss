    <title>Blitzkrieg bug</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/blitzkrieg-bug/422318</link>
    <description>I decided to download Blitzkrieg anthology, as it seemed a pretty cool game. And after playing a few missions, it is. A game I&#39;d love to play more often. But one thing that prevents me from advancing in any campaign: by the time I reach mission 2 or so of chapter 2, shit starts to happen. When in game, I can&#39;t use my mouse to scroll around the map (by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen), the indicators on the minimap, like the one that indicates the approximate location of enemy artillery, won&#39;t disappear from the map even when the artillery stops firing. But the most annoying thing is that the sounds get stuck. Once a tank or other unit fires, you constantly hear the explosions.

Is this a known bug? I&#39;m playing on Vista, so that probably is part of the problem.</description>
