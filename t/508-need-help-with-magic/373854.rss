    <title>[508] Need help with Magic</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-need-help-with-magic/373854</link>
    <description>Hey, so I am using a DavidScape source, and I&#39;m just wondering:

Whenever you use magic spells, it doesn&#39;t show them flying through the air. It just shows the gfx of the spell contact on whatever you cast it on. So like, if you cast fire wave, it only shows the monster or player getting hit with the spell.

Anyone know how to show it going through the air toward the target? Please help.</description>
