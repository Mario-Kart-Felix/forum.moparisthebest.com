    <description>Hi pal,
[center][size=15pt]If you can&#39;t decided which monster is best for you to train with. TRY MY method
This method will lead you to the best MONSTER is best fit for your level.[/size][/center]

The method:
&quot; YOUR COMBAT LEVEL (multiply) YOUR ATTACK STYLE LEVEL (devide) 10 (devide) MONSTER LEVEL = YOUR MOST CLOSE MAX HIT&quot;

Example:
I am going to train my Strength(level 63) with WhiteKnight(36) and my combat level is 71.
So the method will look like this &quot;71*63/10/36 = 12.425&quot;
My maxhit is 13 so 12.425 is ok (very near)

Remember:
YOUR MOST CLOSE MAX HIT is ok if it lower than your maxhit but shouldn&#39;t higher.
This method is working only with melee training.
This method is my own, if you think it is stupid or something please freely comment.
If you tell this method to the others please call this method as PcNy&#39;s Method.

[center]FEEL FREE TO USE MY METHOD[/center]</description>
