    <title>Need start up help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-start-up-help/362811</link>
    <description>Hey,
I&#39;m ready to publish my server. I need somebody to teamview me and help.
I know very little, but nevertheless have set up my No-IP Duc, my port 43594 is forwarded,
My server is on and client is open, etc. But the problem is, when I go to publish it on
the server status list, it says it is offline. Another bit of help I need is, I use a client
to open this, does everyone else need to, too? If so; what exactly do I upload so
everyone can download it? MY BASE SERVER IS PROJECT INSANITY.

HELPPPP?

Please (:
