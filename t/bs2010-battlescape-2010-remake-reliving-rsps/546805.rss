    <description>[center][b]BattleScape 2010/1 Remake[/b]



[b]Introduction:[/b]

we&#39;ve had this plan of making Battlescape 2010 Remake for awhile so we have finally considered starting this project now.
Battlescape had around 900-1000 active players back in 2010, but the players dropped slowly and slowly after newer versions of Battlescape which made some players quit/leave it for good. 
I&#39;ve seen so many people just wanting the Oldschool feeling back and the prime times of RSPS and Battlescape, we&#39;ve also had some famous youtubers wanting a Battlescape 2010 replica so here we are doing it.
We will create together with our very experienced developers a replica of Battlescape 1/2010, so don&#39;t lose your hopes yet!

[b]Information:[/b]

- When you first log in, you will be located in Netitiznot (Home).
- Change settings, such as HP bar, hitmarks, and fog from ingame.
- PK against other players in the Wilderness, and gain EP for extra rewards on top of the other player’s risked items.
-Stake other players, choosing what can and can&#39;t be used in the fight.
- Pest Control is a Zombie Survival minigame insipred from CoD instead.
Explore the God Wars Dungeon, and fight bosses such as General Graardor.
- The Kalphite Queen has both forms which work flawlessly.
- You can kill Barrelchest to acquire a Barrelchest Anchor.
- Unlock the Lunar Magic spellbook
- Play through a number of rounds to unlock different RFD gloves.
- Fight against Mithril Dragons, and possibly gain a Dragon Fullhelm.
