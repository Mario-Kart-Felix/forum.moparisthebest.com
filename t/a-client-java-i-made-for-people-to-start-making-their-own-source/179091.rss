    <title>A client.java I made for people to start making their own source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-client-java-i-made-for-people-to-start-making-their-own-source/179091</link>
    <description>Use this for a source start. I made it in about 2 hours from me to all of you. I hope this makes server building easier on some people.

{~~CREDITS~~}
gr1m r3ea4r (i think that&#39;s his name) 10% for client.java file
Me 89% for editing adding features and building most all of it and now releasing it to you all
neo765 1% for helping add a few litle tweaks (barley anything)
How do I make a client.java a virus I am saying that because I don&#39;t think you can.
Enjoy :D</description>
