    <description>Hello. I have wanted to make a house, actually, a mansion!!! Okay. Back to the point. I want to put together a team to help me make a list of null IDs. For example, I made a list of 83-205. I dont NEED help, but it&#39;ll take ages before I finish. I already one helper, and hasnt done much yet  :P. I also wanna help people by releasing this to help All people. What I mean by this is like this.

[b]97 = Beginning / End of a stair case[/b]

So far, I have this done. It took me about an hour to do, but the null IDs go up to 9999... 

[code]Null Object ID List
Made By: Lin
Numbers 83 - 205
R = ReplaceGlobalObject
A/M = Add / MakeGlobalObject
N/A = Niether
F = ReplaceFloor
U = Unknown

83 = Nothing = N/A
84 = Nothing = N/A
85 = Something Invisible = A/M
88 = Something Invisible = A/M
97 = Beginning / End of a stair case it looks like... = A/M
107 = Black square with what looks like the corner of a rug.. Almost like a kite... = F
108 = Black Rectangle = F
109 = Black Square = F
110 = A strange shaped brown thing... Almost shaped like a Manta Ray = F
111 = Brown/Black Arrow SE = F
112 = Brown/Black Arrow NW = F
113 = Brown/Black Arrow SW = F
137 = Gate Door with lock = A/M
138 = Gate Door with lock = A/M
139 = Gate Door with lock = A/M
140 = Gate Door with lock = A/M
141 = Gate Door with lock = A/M
142 = Gate Door with lock = A/M
143 = Gate Door with lock = A/M
144 = Gate Door with lock = A/M
145 = Gate Door with lock = A/M
146 = Invisible Wall W = A/M
147 = Invisible Wall W = A/M
148 = Invisible Wall W = A/M
149 = Invisible Corner S &amp; W = A/M
150 = Invisible Corner S &amp; W = A/M
151 = Invisible Corner S &amp; W = A/M
161 = Invisible Corner S &amp; W = A/M
168 = Short Wooden Gate = R
169 = Like... A floor thing... Like this: |=| Except with bigger = and more of them = F
174 = Litter... With a yellow piece and grey things... = F
175 = Litter... With 2 bottles and grey things... = F
176 = A bunch of brown triangles, small ones = F
177 = 4 Brown small triangles = F
178 = 5 Brown small triangles = F
179 = A bunch of grey triangles, small ones = F
180 = A lot more grey triangles, small ones = F
181 = 4 Grey small triangles = F
182 = 3 Grey small triangles = F
183 = Nothing
184 = A bunch of diamond/triangle brown things = F
185 = Normal Wall
186 = 5 Brown things; circles, diamonds, and triangles = F
191 = Left Half of a Big Door (cant open) with a green star on it = A/M
192 = Right Half of a Big Door (cant open) with a green star on it = A/M
193 = Part of a short wooden fence = R
196 = Weather Changer? Time Changer? Time Teller? Invisible/Non-Blocker = U
197 = Weather Changer? Time Changer? Time Teller? Invisible/Non-Blocker = U
198 = Weather Changer? Time Changer? Time Teller? Invisible/Non-Blocker = U
199 = REALLY strange wall... Almost looks like a sand wall... Has a ledge coming out of it... = A/M
205 = Left half of a big door it looks like... Almost like 191 but no ropes/fence and a different green symbol.[/code] Where it says Made By Lin will change and other people&#39;s names will go there.

In order to help me, post here or PM me. You must have done [b]Federexer&#39;s Adding Global Objects[/b] and [b]Federexer&#39;s Buildings[/b]. This is an example of finding out whether it is a ReplaceObject, Replacefloor, or Add/MakeGlobalObject.

[code]ReplaceObject(3226, 3429, 205, 0);//
makeGlobalObject(3226, 3428, 205, 0, 10);//
Replacefloor(3226, 3427, 205, 0);
[/code] This is making it so like if the item spawns on the coords 3226, 3429 itll be a ReplaceObject required. And you should get the rest. When you have a list of atleast a 100, PM me and I will add it to my list at my site.

Hope you will help!!!
