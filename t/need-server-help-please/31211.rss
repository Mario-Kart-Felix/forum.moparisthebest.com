    <description>hi. Im having trouble getting on private servers. Well yesterday I was getting on them perfect. But whan I got on today I logged on and the connection lost so I tried to log on again but it kept on saying error can&#39;t connect to server. When it said that yesterday all I did was wait 1 min. or 2, and I was able to log. But now it just won&#39;t log on. I&#39;ve been unable to log for around 1hr now.[br][size=1]Posted at: December 01, 2006, 04:56:08 PM[/size][hr]Anyone?</description>
