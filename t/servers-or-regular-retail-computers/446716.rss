    <title>Server&#39;s or Regular Retail Computers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/servers-or-regular-retail-computers/446716</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve been looking at new computers for awhile now, and I just recently started looking at used servers. I understand that if I buy one, that I need to install BIOS (I heard the free versions are shitty. I don&#39;t know), and then install Windows, or Linux. Along with getting a monitor, other accessories. Anyways, these servers seem like that there better than a retail PC, specification wise. What is the major difference that makes them so cheap?

I was looking at one that was HP DL580 G3/ 4x Intel Xeon 3.00GHz Dual Core/16GB RAM/3x18GB HDD RAID 5 (54 Gb) Which would retail if I&#39;m not wrong ~1200$? So, yeah my main question is what is the difference? How well would they work for a home computer? I don&#39;t plan on using it to rent out, or anything.

If this doesn&#39;t make sense, ask I&#39;ll try to explain more.</description>

install a bios? wtf… usually the only difference is more power (usage and output) and bigger space needed.</p>

              <p>Just build your own computer, get an i7 core processor, 6-8 gbs of ram is all you will need, i doubt you will be running probrams that will take 5-7 gbs or your ram anyways, then just buy an ssd and teh set up raid with a couple other hard drives for massive space or even set up your own nas. You should be able to run programs that dont need high graphics with little problem.</p>

<p>Usually they have lower resource speeds, but higher availability. As in your example, it has 16 GB of RAM. But that 16GB might be running at 800MHz, whereas most commercial RAM is running at 1066-1800 MHz. The same goes for the processor. It probably has more cores, but only running at 3.0 GHz. (which is still pretty good). Another thing is that the mounting and power supplies are different.</p>
