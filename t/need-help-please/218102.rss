    <description>Okay I worked on designing a whole server for a while. I had it done, but now I wanted bandos and the new items in. And my server basically cant handle it. I get them in with a new client and I added them to item.cfg and item.java and still they wont go to the right spot. They actuall items come up but it wont let me use them in the right way wtf.?</description>
