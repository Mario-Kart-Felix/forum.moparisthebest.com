    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;m using a DeltaScape source, and I need help with making range work properly. Range works great in every area of the source, except for FIGHT PITS. Whenever someone is attacked with range inside fight pits, no damage is done, except when the special attack is used.

Thanks in advance for helping!
