Hello, I am Josh I am currently wanting to work on a game I want to use a base off of moparscape, and get rid of all the models in game, and I would like to start from sratch.

I am hoping to make this like runescape, but has a comeplty different feel to it. I would like to try, and work towards making this like the following games. “world of warcraft”, “Runescape”, “Perfect world” and “combat arms” I know this will be a lot of work. many years will be have to put into it, but I feel That while I do this It will also teach me how to code, and I won’t feel ashamed of playing Runescape Private servers. I only acually played to learn how to do this. Now here is you’re chance to help. I require a:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Thank you all for your help.<br>
