              <p>Hi there, welcome to MoparScape. Before you get started I’d encourage you to read <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,354311.0.html" data-bbcode="true">The MoparScape Rules</a>. Additionally the General Discussion section isn’t intended for RuneScape Private Server help. The correct section is <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,48.0.html" data-bbcode="true">Server Help</a>. In that section you will also notice that there are additional rules (<a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,331370.0.html" data-bbcode="true">here</a>). These are rules that apply to the section you are posting in, please read through those rules as well before you post a thread asking for help.</p>
<p>We’re more than happy to help but you have to put fort some effort first. Some quick tips:</p>
<p>[ul][li]In the world of RSPS ambiguity is rarely anyone’s friend, so be very direct and descriptive when requesting help[/li]<br>
[li]Make use of topics that have already been created. We have wonderful tutorials and many resolved issues all of which can be found with a few keywords and the click of a button using our [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=search;advanced]<img src="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/Themes/core/images/filter.gif" alt width="" height="">Advanced Search<br>
[list][li]The Advanced Search allows you to to select which sections you want to search in, which is great for weeding out unwanted results.[/li][/list][/li]<br>
[li]A topics subject can get you fast help or no help, be as descriptive as you can when naming your topic.[/li]<br>
[li]Asking for “help” will rarely result in getting help; use your knowledge of the situation to describe it. Ex “Running a Private Server”[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Unfortunately this topic cannot be moved to Server Help because its far too ambiguous and just as it doesn’t follow the rules of this section it also doesn’t follow the rules of the help section. I will simply lock this thread for the time being. If you post an appropriate thread I will go ahead and delete this one, otherwise I will delete this topic in several days.</p>
