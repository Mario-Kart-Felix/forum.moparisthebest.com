              <p>someone elses tut, not mine</p>
<p>[code]Purpose: To learn how to force players to use your client.</p>
<p>Difficulty: 1/10</p>
<p>Assumed Knowledge: none… im here to teach you right?</p>
<p>Server Base: pimpscape</p>
<p>Classes Modified: client.java (server), signlink.java(client)</p>
<p>Procedure:</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>In your client’s signlink.java search for</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>public final void run()
</code></pre>
<p>under that you should see:</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>UID =</p>
<p>This tells the client what the user’s UID is when connecting to the server. Most clients just use a random number for this, but we are going to set an unchanging number. Make this as hard to guess as you can.</p>
<p>Step 2:<br>
In your server’s client.java find this:</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>int UID = inStream.readDWord();</p>
<p>or something of the sort and under that add this:</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>		if(UID != (your uid here)) {
			System.out.println("Player is not using the (your servername) Client!");
                   		returnCode = 7;
		}
</code></pre>
<p>This basically is the server asking the client what its UID is, and if it is not the UID you set in the if statement, it sends a packet back to the client, and prints a message in the DOS window telling you that they have connected with the wrong client.</p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p>Now search for:</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>if(PlayerHandler.playerCount &lt; PlayerHandler.maxPlayers</p>
<p>or something like that (it should be a little ways down just scroll).</p>
<p>It should look like this completely:</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>if(PlayerHandler.playerCount &lt; PlayerHandler.maxPlayers) {<br>
returnCode = 2;<br>
} else if(PlayerHandler.playerCount &gt;= PlayerHandler.maxPlayers) {<br>
returnCode = 7;<br>
savefile = false;<br>
disconnected = true;<br>
appendToLR(playerName+" failed to logon because there is too many players online.");<br>
}</p>
<p>now replace that whole thing with this:</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>if(PlayerHandler.playerCount &lt; PlayerHandler.maxPlayers &amp;&amp; UID == -44232342) {<br>
returnCode = 2;<br>
} else if(PlayerHandler.playerCount &gt;= PlayerHandler.maxPlayers || UID != -44232342) {<br>
returnCode = 7;<br>
savefile = false;<br>
disconnected = true;<br>
appendToLR(playerName+" failed to logon because there is too many players online.");<br>
}</p>
<p>I used this because it is the most useless out of the rest, and making a new one often caused a problem that would not disconnect the player correctly, so they would be stuck online. Feel free to make your own or just add:</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>disconnected = true;</p>
<p>into the code in step two, I am just pointing out that you may have a problem with this and might have to work out a fix for it.</p>
<p>Anyway this code basically does the same thing as the code in step 2, however it disconnects the player.</p>
<p>Conclusion:<br>
You now have put a requirement of your client to connect to the server. Using what i did on most clients will say something like “this world is full” or something like that, but you can change the:</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>returnCode =</p>
<p>to anything you want to change the message that the player will recieve but you will have to find those in your client’s client.java (im not gonna post a list sorry).[/code]</p>
