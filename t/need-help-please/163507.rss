    <description>Ok heres problem #1. I finally got my server up and working and i added it to server status. I went to open it up and i logged in and it was hybrid scape, and 2 or 3 people has logged in. How do i fix that?

Here&#39;s problem #2. after the server messed up i shut it down and tried to re-enter it on server status. It said something about &quot;You can only post 1 server at a time blah blah blah blah.&quot; So, I went to offline servers and look mine up. I tryed to erase it but i couldn&#39;t, how do I erase it from server status? If you can help me I&#39;d really appreciate it.

Thx,
Bman

Alright. Wait until your server goes under 40% (maybe 2 hours ). and if you wanta change the server name, go to client.java and do Ctrl- F and type up Hybridscape, and replace with your server name e.g. SnowycardsScape or ExampleScape or RunePkz… but you must edit your server a little or its leaching (taking someone elses server and calling it your own)</p>

<p>Go into client.java and search for “hybridscape”. Then replace with whatever your server name is. But don’t download a source without editing it first.</p>
