    <description>OH GOD NOT ANOTHER ONE.

But yea. I feel like talking about dreams again, but not the kinds, simply what happens to you in them. I, for example, can often feel pain in my dreams, and I can still feel it after waking up (I got cut in a dream once and got a bandage due to me still feeling it). Also, I can taste, smell, and even distinguish hot and cold things in my dreams. But the one thing that absolutely puzzles me in my dreams is why I can&#39;t scream.
       In every dream that I tried screaming in, I never could. I just don&#39;t understand why I can do just about anything else in my dreams except scream. Oh well, it&#39;s just one more mental problem with me :3.  
       Now discuss, because I know topics like these tend to interest many people :s</description>

<p>It seems to me that the dreams you have always are perfect timing. Like it’s hard to explain. For example, in your dream someone is about to wake you up, and in real life at that exact same time someone wakes you up. Or like this happened to me once. I had a dream I was being chased by someone and they were trying to kill me. The very second the person caught me and was about to stab me, my friend smacked me in the face and woke me up. It’s so weird how your dreams time up so perfectly with interactions in real life before they even happen. It’s almost like your mind is reading the future seconds before it happens.</p>

It’s so weird how your dreams time up so perfectly with interactions in real life before they even happen. It’s almost like your mind is reading the future seconds before it happens. I also find it funny how the dream you’re having could be scaring the shit out of you and you wake up. Then minutes later you fall back asleep right back into that dream but you could be having a dream where you’re fucking the hottest girl in the world and when you wake up and can’t go back to sleep. Then you sit there for like 20 minutes keeping your eyes shut tight knowing you’re not going to fall back asleep because you’re not tired at all but you kind of try to trick yourself into thinking you’re asleep lmfao. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve done that. I’ll tell you this though it’s bullshit. Also, this is weird as fuck. Sometimes right when I wake up from having a dream, I can actually guess the exact time it is before looking at the time.</p>
<p>The only times I jerk myself awake is when I’m sleeping in school, I fall asleep near a turned-on television, or I fall asleep with my head up right. And sometimes when I’m hearing somebody talking near me. (The teachers talking is probably why I jerk awake in school.) whenever I fall asleep with my head up right, I always have that “falling” dream where you feel like you’re falling from a very high distance (the feeling on a roller coaster) and I jerk awake. Also, for some odd reason, 99% of the time I have dreams is when I sleep during the day. I almost never have dreams at night. I also have a lot of random weird ass dreams that’d make you go wtf.</p>
<p>My favorite kind of dreams are the ones where someone is chasing you trying to kill you because I find those so exciting and it gets your adrenaline going. I actually go to bed hoping for those kinds of dreams. The guy who always chases me though is Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th movies. I don’t know why. I love those movies though.</p>

<p>I always work my way through them. I endure it I suppose for the experience. Plus, it never hurts when I get shot. Other times I’ve been bitten by dogs and i just fling them off and find something else to do in my dream. Whenever situations like that happen it seems to be an opportunity to open up lucid practice, allowing me to control my dreams.</p>

It happens when you sleep all the time so you don’t perform the actions in real life that you are doing in your dream. If you lay with your arms at your side, breathing like you would while asleep, and basically laying still (as you would while sleeping), you can trick your body into falling asleep while your mind I still awake. It can be hard to do at first ( I can barely get half way without interrupting myself on accident), but you can eventually do it whenever you want. I might try this again now lol.</p>

[/quote]I almost got eaten by a shark in my dream last night, but I woke up in time. It was funny though, because I freely thought that it was going to eat me, and then it turned around and chased after me. I then thought that I was gonna die, and just before it killed me I woke up. God, I have starnge things happen to me in my dreams o.o…[/quote]</p>
<p>Ah I think I had a dream similar to that once, except I escaped it I think… Once I had one where spiders were randomly coming at me, and trying to bite me. Strange enough that I did wake up after one bit me, with a sharp pain at my back. Doubt it was anything to do with the dream though.</p>

Hypnic jerks are one form of involuntary muscle twitches called myoclonus. Physically, hypnic jerks resemble the "jump" experienced by a person when startled, sometimes accompanied by a falling sensation.

<p>But yea. I feel like talking about dreams again, but not the kinds, simply what happens to you in them. I, for example, can often feel pain in my dreams, and I can still feel it after waking up (I got cut in a dream once and got a bandage due to me still feeling it). Also, I can taste, smell, and even distinguish hot and cold things in my dreams. But the one thing that absolutely puzzles me in my dreams is why I can’t scream.<br>
In every dream that I tried screaming in, I never could. I just don’t understand why I can do just about anything else in my dreams except scream. Oh well, it’s just one more mental problem with me :3.<br>
Now discuss, because I know topics like these tend to interest many people :s</p>
