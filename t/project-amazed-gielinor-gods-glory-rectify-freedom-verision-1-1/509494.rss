[size=24pt]SERVER SIDED:[/size]

[size=16pt]What has been Added?:[/size]

[size=12pt]Report System:[/size] Cleaner, now prints out the report a player option and takes approximately 5.03 seconds to print out the report.

[size=12pt]Player Saving:[/size] I fixed it to much more suitable prospective and it is much better as you don&#39;t have to be clicking much.

[size=12pt]Player:[/size] I fixed it too, i changed the ipban to the same way in the &quot;char&quot; folder in the server folder.


[size=24pt]CLIENT SIDED:[/size]

[size=12pt]Cache:[/size]  I completely changed the way it was. It has cachedownloader.java now, reason being is because i decided i was going to port-forward it. The customs look alright i guess. Though they look small i will fix this in the next version. Cache is much better looking, and cleaner.

[size=12pt]Downloading the Cache:[/size] Their can be problems with downloading because the dropbox has some issues downloading the small cache files i don&#39;t know why.

[size=12pt]New &quot;Twin Set&quot;:[/size] I had the chance to just simply add the new weapons, i decided to make &quot;Twin Whips&quot; which require attack 75, and strength 75, but i didn&#39;t have time to add it on the Source Sided.

[size=24pt]Tutorial for Downloading Cache:[/size]

The cache i gave you might or might not download right, if so, i gaved a backup in the Project folder.

[size=16pt]1):[/size] If it doesn&#39;t load and give errors, go to: c:/ProjectAmazed

Explanation: The files may have not extracted completly or dropbox didn&#39;t even download all. This happened to me.

[size=16pt]2):[/size] Open up the Project Folder and click on the: ProjectAmazed.zip file.

Explanation: This one is a backup for the cache so just simply click on it or download winrar. Go to google type: winrar and download it.

[size=16pt]3):[/size] Extract all the files to the: c:/ProjectAmazed and press [ Yes To All ]

Explanation: Click on the [ Extract to ] and extract the files [ Sprites, data, models, cache, etc. ] and it will put it the right files and where their suppose to be.

[size=16pt]4):[/size] Click on the C&amp;R or client on the web folder. It should work now.

Explanation: C&amp;R stands for: Compiler and Run. This is my custom made compiler you just clcik it and you need jdk1.7.0 or change it to jdk1.6.0 and it will start compiling. The client on: project/web/client. Is my download client in case you don&#39;t feel like compiling and running... You can just delete the: Web folder if you want.
_______________________________________________________________________

[size=26pt]THIS ISN&#39;T LEECHED OR HAS A ANTI-LEECH[/size]

Reason being: Why release something if you want to make people mad why they can&#39;t find errors or anything.
