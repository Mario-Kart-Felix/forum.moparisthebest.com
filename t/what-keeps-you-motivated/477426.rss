    <title>What keeps you motivated?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-keeps-you-motivated/477426</link>
    <description>This is something I&#39;ve always wanted to know. I like to develop servers and see where they take me, but I&#39;ve gotten bored of em. Everything I want to do, has been done, or is being done. I don&#39;t want to be a person that looks like they are copying another person. I understand that we&#39;re taking off RuneScape, which had seen its better years. But still, these servers are just getting worse because not all of us (me included) know how to program them correctly, and learn off already bad bases.

Anyways, I want to know, what keeps you all motivated to keep working on a private server?</description>
