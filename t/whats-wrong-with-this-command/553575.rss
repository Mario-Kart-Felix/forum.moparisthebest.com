    <title>What&#39;s wrong with this command?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-wrong-with-this-command/553575</link>
    <description>Hey guys,


I&#39;m new to Java coding but i enjoy it a lot so i decided to just try some stuff out.
I (obviously) started with the basics, and i can&#39;t seem to figure out why this command does not work:
[code]if((playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;removedonor&quot;)) &amp;&amp; c.playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Primed&quot;)) {
			try {
				String playerToDemote = playerCommand.substring(7);
				for(int i = 0; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++) {
					if(PlayerHandler.players[i] != null) {
						if(PlayerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToDemote)) {
							Client c2 = (Client)PlayerHandler.players[i];
							c2.sendMessage(&quot;Your donator status has been removed by a staff member.&quot;);
							c2.isDonator=0;
							c2.logout();
							break;
						}
					}
				}
			} catch(Exception e) {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;Player must be offline.&quot;);
			}
		}
[/code]

I coppied it from this command and changed it so that it doesn&#39;t remove the player&#39;s rights (mod/admin) but only his donator rights.

[code]
if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;demote&quot;)) {
			try {
				String playerToDemote = playerCommand.substring(7);
				for(int i = 0; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++) {
					if(PlayerHandler.players[i] != null) {
						if(PlayerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToDemote)) {
							Client c2 = (Client)PlayerHandler.players[i];
							c2.sendMessage(&quot;You have been demoted by &quot; + c.playerName);
							c2.playerRights = 0;
							c2.logout();
							break;
						}
					}
				}
			} catch(Exception e) {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;Player must be offline.&quot;);
			}
		}
[/code]

I don&#39;t get an error while compiling, the command itself just does not work.
So why does the demote command work but not the removedonor command?


Thanks in advance :)

EDIT: I&#39;m going to add sendmessage in there to see if it does execute that, will post results in a minute.

EDIT2:
Changed the code to this:
[code]
if((playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;removedonor&quot;)) &amp;&amp; c.playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Primed&quot;)) {
			c.sendMessage(&quot;Test 1&quot;);
			try {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;Test 2&quot;);
				String playerToDemote = playerCommand.substring(7);
				for(int i = 0; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++) {
					if(PlayerHandler.players[i] != null) {
						if(PlayerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToDemote)) {
							Client c2 = (Client)PlayerHandler.players[i];
							c2.sendMessage(&quot;Your donator status has been removed by a staff member.&quot;);
							c.sendMessage(&quot;Test 3&quot;);
							c2.isDonator=0;
							c2.logout();
							break;
						}
					}
				}
			} catch(Exception e) {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;Player must be offline.&quot;);
			}
			c.sendMessage(&quot;Test 4&quot;);
		}
[/code]

[spoiler=This is the result:][img]http://puu.sh/kLlZV/ab85ae7eb2.jpg[/img][/spoiler]
EDIT 3:
I commented out [code]if(PlayerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToDemote)) {[/code]. The code works now, but the demoted player still keeps his donator crown. How do i fix that?


So something is wrong around the Test 3 message, but i get no errors so i can&#39;t figure out why..</description>

              <p>That error means you have variable with the same name as it.</p>
<p>So basically this:</p>
<p><code>if ((playerCommand.startsWith("removedonor"))) {
     Client c2 = (Client) p;
     Client c2 = (Client) p;

<p>But it can include nested if statements. (Nested if statements are statements within each other).</p>

<p>As for the command, i tried your code, getting an error. I will try to solve it myself first before i ask you again though ^^</p>
<p>What does <code>src\server\model\players\packets\Commands.java:1825: error: variable c2 is already defined in method ownerCommands(Client,String)
                                                                Client c2 = (Client)PlayerHandler.players[i];
                                                                       </code><br>
mean? Because what i get from that is that it’s already declared a.k.a i can remove that line of code. However when i remove it it doesn’t give me an error but instead executes the code on the player who executes the command</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Let’s address this one thing at a time.</p>
<p>First:<br>
Writing commands is one of the more basic parts of RSPS. If you’re having trouble here, well, the rest of it is just going to be harder. You should look into reading some tutorials and documentation on Java. Again, <span class="bbcode-b">tutorials and documentation on java</span>. Tutorials about RSPS actually tend to teach very little, and most have poor code.<br>
Here are some links to help you:</p>

<p>Second:</p>
<p>The reason your command worked with you removed:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Is because it went through and demoted <span class="bbcode-b">every player that was online</span>.</p>
<p>A for loop loops until the increment makes the initialization variable reach the point where the termination value would return true. However, if you set up a loop incorrectly, it may go on forever.</p>
<p><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
     System.out.println("i equals: " + i);
}</code><br>
Would print:</p>
<p><code>i equals: 0
i equals: 1
i equals: 2
i equals: 3
i equals: 4
i equals: 5
i equals: 6
i equals: 7
i equals: 8
i equals: 9</code><br>
However, this loop:</p>
<p><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt;= 10; i++) {
     System.out.println("i equals: " + i);
}</code><br>
Would print:</p>
<p><code>i equals: 0
i equals: 1
i equals: 2
i equals: 3
i equals: 4
i equals: 5
i equals: 6
i equals: 7
i equals: 8
i equals: 9
i equals: 10</code><br>
All because you added an equals sign.</p>
<p>An example of an “infinite” for loop:</p>
<p><code>int p = 0;
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 9; p++) {
     System.out.println("i equals: " + i);
}</code><br>
This would print out:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Until you ran out of memory, or exited the program. This is because you are increasing the variable <span class="bbcode-b">p</span> instead of <span class="bbcode-b">i</span>.</p>
<p>To read more on for loops, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/for.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Click here</a>.</p>
<p>Third:<br>
The reason you got errors with your new command is because you didn’t add the code correctly. Due to this you caused a bracket error (You had too many), which shows in the compiler as 100 errors. Well, that’s the main reason at least. The other reasons were due to duplicate variable names, but they wouldn’t have been seen.</p>
<p>Fourth:<br>
I wanted you to replace the for loop with my loop. And then add onto the if statement I provided to check for a username along side the null check. Here’s the base command:</p>
<p>[code=java]if ((playerCommand.startsWith(“removedonor”)) &amp;&amp; c.playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(“Primed”)) {<br>
try {<br>
for (Player p: PlayerHandler.players) {<br>
Client c2 = (Client) p; // casts the Player object to a Client object.<br>
if (c2 != null) { // This is where you handle everything for the other client.</p>
<pre><code>		}
	}
} catch(Exception e) {
	
}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>Let’s see if you can get a bit further with that.</p>

              <p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:2, topic:553575”]Your issue is where you’re splitting the command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>If you count how many characters are in “removedonor”:</p>
<p><code>r e m o v e d o n o r

<p>There’s a size mismatch.</p>
<p>This is what happens when you A) Copy and paste a command without changing everything. and B) Could have wrote the command to split at the first space, instead of a “guesstimated” index.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>This will split the command from 1 index greater than the first index of a space. We do this as we want to ignore the space, not include it. This will throw an exception if there are no spaces found in the string, as it’d return -1.</p>
<p>Another tip:</p>
<p>While you’re just copying an existing command, you should try to write it as best as possible. One of these ways would be to loop the player list, instead of iterating through MAX_PLAYERS. You have no need for the index in the for loop, so you can use an Enhanced for loop:</p>
<p><code>for(Player p : PlayerHandler.players) {
     Client c2 = (Client)p;// casts the Player object to a Client object.
     if(c2 != null) {

     }
}</code><br>
You can check for a specific username along side the null check, but just make sure the null check is first.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for the tips, but i’m not good enough at java coding yet. There’s no way i can write my own commands/code.<br>
Also, i have no idea what the code you wrote does ^^<br>
I edited the first post, i commented out:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>because i felt like that isn’t a part of donator rights (turns out i was right, since the command works now). Problem is: The demoted donator still keeps his donator icon. He can’t use any donator commands though.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
So you’re saying this code is somehow better then the code i “made”?</p>
<p>[code]			if ((playerCommand.startsWith(“removedonor”)) &amp;&amp; c.playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(“Primed”)) {<br>
for(Player p : PlayerHandler.players) {<br>
Client c2 = (Client)p;// casts the Player object to a Client object.<br>
if(c2 != null) { // This is where you handle everything for the other client.<br>
if(PlayerHandler.players[i] != null) {<br>
//if(PlayerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToDemote)) {<br>
Client c2 = (Client)PlayerHandler.players[i];<br>
c2.sendMessage(“Your donator status has been removed by a staff member.”);<br>
c.sendMessage(“Test 3”);<br>
c2.isDonator=0;<br>
c2.logout();<br>
break;<br>
}<br>
} catch (Exception e) {<br>
c.sendMessage(“Player must be offline.”)<br>
}</p>
<p>}<br>
}<br>
[/code]</p>
<p>EDIT: I get the following errors when compiling:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">src\server\model\players\packets\Commands.java:1833: error: ';' expected
                        c.sendMessage("Player must be offline.")

<p>I coppied it from this command and changed it so that it doesn’t remove the player’s rights (mod/admin) but only his donator rights.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (playerCommand.startsWith("demote")) {
			try {
				String playerToDemote = playerCommand.substring(7);
				for(int i = 0; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++) {
					if(PlayerHandler.players[i] != null) {
						if(PlayerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToDemote)) {
							Client c2 = (Client)PlayerHandler.players[i];
							c2.sendMessage("You have been demoted by " + c.playerName);
							c2.playerRights = 0;
							c2.logout();
							break;
						}
					}
				}
			} catch(Exception e) {
				c.sendMessage("Player must be offline.");
			}
		}</code></pre>
<p>I don’t get an error while compiling, the command itself just does not work.<br>
So why does the demote command work but not the removedonor command?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: I’m going to add sendmessage in there to see if it does execute that, will post results in a minute.</p>
<p>EDIT2:<br>
Changed the code to this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if((playerCommand.startsWith("removedonor")) &amp;&amp; c.playerName.equalsIgnoreCase("Primed")) {
			c.sendMessage("Test 1");
			try {
				c.sendMessage("Test 2");
				String playerToDemote = playerCommand.substring(7);
				for(int i = 0; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++) {
					if(PlayerHandler.players[i] != null) {
						if(PlayerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToDemote)) {
							Client c2 = (Client)PlayerHandler.players[i];
							c2.sendMessage("Your donator status has been removed by a staff member.");
							c.sendMessage("Test 3");
							c2.isDonator=0;
							c2.logout();
							break;
						}
					}
				}
			} catch(Exception e) {
				c.sendMessage("Player must be offline.");
			}
			c.sendMessage("Test 4");
		}</code></pre>
<p>[spoiler=This is the result:]<img src="http://puu.sh/kLlZV/ab85ae7eb2.jpg" alt width="" height="">[/spoiler]<br>
EDIT 3:<br>
I commented out <code>if(PlayerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToDemote)) {</code>. The code works now, but the demoted player still keeps his donator crown. How do i fix that?</p>
<p>So something is wrong around the Test 3 message, but i get no errors so i can’t figure out why…</p>
