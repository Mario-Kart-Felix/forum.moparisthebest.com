    <description>[center][u][size=36pt]FlattenedCraft[/size][/u]
Flattened-craft was established 2 years ago as a friendly, free server for my friends it quickly grow and grow. Last year (2011) I decided that it was time to bring flattened-craft to the public but before it went online we had a huge server melt down and we have only just got the server back online a few months ago. This is why i ask if any one would like to be admin please comment. I hope to see you on Flattened-Craft very soon.
