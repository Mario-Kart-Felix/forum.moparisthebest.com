    <description>I&#39;ve gotten into the Mine Craft Coder Pack, and I think programming mods for Mine Craft is way more advanced and fun than any RSPS programming. The fact that it is nothing but advanced code makes it interesting, and noobie developers wouldn&#39;t be releasing thing we wouldn&#39;t want or think would be a waste of a post. Even though this is just an RSPS forum, having Mine Craft stuff would make it even better :)

Topics for the Mine Craft development could be

[ol][li]Mine Craft Downloads[/li]
[li]Mine Craft Sprites[/li]
[li]Mine Craft Server Development[/li]
[li]Mine Craft Servers[/li][/ol]</description>
