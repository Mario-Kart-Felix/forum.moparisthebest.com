    <description>I have not been allowed to play non-bloody fighting games and I find it really unfair. When I&#39;m board, I just play a pokemon game like unovarpg (no I&#39;m not a fan of pokemon), but even that isn&#39;t allowed.</description>

              <p>When I was young, I was exposed to a then new GTA 2. To me, this game was my life. I’d always had a dream of being a pixelated figure walking around and throwing bombs at random people in 2D worlds, then working for some gangs and exterminating their opponents. After a particularly long night of GTA, I crashed and when I woke up there was a fire outside and people were screaming. Turns out I took some bombs out of my father’s closet while he was asleep and started throwing them at random people while yelling “REMEMBER – RESPECT IS EVERYTHING!”</p>

Honestly there’s no problem with playing games like Black Op’s or the modern warefare series but games that swear and have excessive violence like GTA you should definitely not be allowed to play.</p>

The reasoning behind it is that it desensitizes you to whatever the content is. This is proven and not arguable.</p>
<p>The argument is that being desensitized means that you may change your morals or whatever. This changes from person to person, and your parents are just being protective. I wouldn’t say stupid or idiotic, as you are pretty young (no offense), but it’s the same sort of thing we have movie and game ratings for etc. Times have just changes. Would you expect your parents to let you watch porn? I’m sure there are some parents that wouldn’t mind, but the majority of parents would never let you do it willingly. It’s just a standard that’s slowly going in one direction.</p>
<p>PS - If it really is about the blood, most games have mods or options that allow you to turn blood off. This worked for my neighbor (3 years younger than me) whose parents don’t like him playing bloody games.<br>

I don’t think you understand 100%… I’m saying that even a game like dbz or pkmn isn’t allowed.[/quote]Hmm, I dunno. I admit that’s pretty overprotective… ask them specifically why pokemon isn’t allowed</p>
