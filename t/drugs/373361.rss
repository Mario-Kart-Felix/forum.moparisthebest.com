Yeah it’s prejudice because I can’t identify the sane people who have taken drugs, since well most people are sane. But the matter of the fact is I can spot those people for their use of drugs. Not sure what they’ve been taking but my guess is meth/crack cocaine.</p>

You should talk to a doctor about your friend. Not being funny, but there are procedures in place to handle these situations which a doctor will be able to initiate.</p>
<p>It’s incredibly incredibly rare, but psychosis after doing MDMA (pretty much any stimulant, afaik) does happen, and your friend definitely sounds at least borderline psychotic. If its any consolation, chances are it was gonna happen anyway and the MDMA was just a catalyst, if it was even related at all.</p>
<p>But you should help him get help, if he’s your buddy. He’s not really in the right frame of mind to understand the circumstances.<br>

<p>Rare in relation to the use of ecstasy I’m sure is what he meant, you can’t just generalize all illegal drugs into the word “drugs”.</p>
<p>The people who you see are probably meth heads or worse lol. Ecstasy has been found to be safer than alcohol by some studies, and there is an awful lot of research looking into its medical properties happening right now.</p>

<p>Subjective. You could also see all the “druggies” I know personally, who are fine. My subjective experience is just as valid as your subjective experience. And nevermind the fact I was referring to one specific problem, and you abstracted it into “PEOPLE R FUCKED FROM THE DURGZ!!!”.</p>
<p>Stimulant induced psychosis that persists for weeks/months after you stop taking the drug IS /incredibly/ rare. Like, barely even on the table rare.</p>

<p>I had a friend to took ecstasy nearly every night for 2 years, and he also frequently took speed and psychedelics too. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia when voices started talking to him. The doctor told him it was unevitable regardless of drugs.</p>

<p>For example;<br>
My very close friend that I’ve known for over 10 years took ecstacy 1½ years ago(diamond ecstacy or whatever), it fucked his mind up really bad. He thinks he’s being tracked/watched where ever he goes, and everyone mimics him, everybody knows ‘something’, and that people talk of him on the radio and television, and he kinda thinks he’s getting paid for that sometime in the future, he even makes up dates where hes supposed to get paid. I’ve tried to tell him over hundred times that that’s all false, your mind is fucking with you and you should go into mental hospital.</p>
<p>I don’t think he will never return back to normal, which is sad…The worst part is that I try to help him everyday I listen to what he’s talking about and it really fucks up my mind also.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Well I am too lazy to read through this discussion and respond to the current flow of conversation so I am just going to answer the original question with short story. About 3 years ago when I joined I would have never considered doing any drugs and probably criticized people who said they smoked weed telling them they are idiots and its bad for you, etc… So first I would like to apologize for that (though I am sure if I did criticize you its been so long ago that you don’t recollect it).</p>
<p>Now this year when I moved states and was under nobodies control but my own I just had to use my own judgement and what I did for my last year of high school. Basically I had learned over the three years i’ve been here and through my own research that there is basically no negative side effects to weed, maybe some negligible ones, but at the frequency at which I smoke there is none. It came into a conversation and basically everyone where I am smokes weed occasionally, maybe 65% of the teens, and I live in a largely conservative area/state so it came to me as a surprise as I thought that it was something associated with liberals yada yada sorry if my arrogance offended you but I am now aware that many people smoke weed regardless of political ideology.</p>
<p>To the point I heard a word in a song (doobie) thought it was a really cool word started saying it alot in random moments to be funny. Some people that are familiar for what it is asked if I had ever smoked one (I said no) then offered to let me smoke with them on a weekend (I said yes) so we smoked a doobie and went to a park and it was awesome.</p>
<p>I could probably go on and on about my encounters with the subject of weed and the kind of people I have smoked with (national merit scholars who get full rides to colleges that smoke with me like every other weekend) to (stoners who smoke every day before school who are still semi-successful that can hold a job and go onto local colleges).</p>
<p>I see nothing wrong with weed (maybe other drugs but I am not interested due to possible health concerns with others) as long as it doesn’t encapsulate your entire life. Nothing is wrong with smoking on the weekend with friends and just chilling an laughing.</p>
<p>To Radeon you will never understand drugs if you never try, you could at least try weed once or twice (I say twice because the first time doesn’t always work) to become enlightened on what drugs like weed exactally do etc… we dont use them to escape reality, just to make reality even better. My life is perfectly fine without weed its just something to do for fun with friends. Sometimes I will smoke every week in a month, other times I wont even smoke in that month and I will be perfectly happy.</p>
<p>Also to any people that say weed is bad or to any people who are like me 3 years ago and try to talk about drugs but don’t know shit…fuck off.</p>
