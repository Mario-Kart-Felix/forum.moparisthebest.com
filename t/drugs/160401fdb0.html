        <p>Well, I got 5x extracts today (the headshop was out of 10x). I tried to type my experience, however explaining things is very difficult when on/coming down from salvia. I typed this about 5 minutes after I took a hit, so I highly doubt any of this makes sense;</p>
<blockquote>all of existence was a large curve. I cannot describe this curve, launguage has eluded me. However because it was a curve, there was a "slope", and coming down from this slope was a sort of living/organic train car. It was an entity, and it seemed moronic. Honestly the image seemed idiotic. If you took the image, and made it into a cartoon (which would be easy, it had a very cartoonish and idiotic feel to it), you would swear the athor was on drugs. Anyways, everything in this trip had some sort of phrase that described it. All the other names were lost upon coming down, however the train car was called "nishgus". I do not know what this means or why it has this name, however I believe this name was assigned by my sub-conscious based on a general concept and qualities of this train car. The name almost seemed like it was said aloud. Not physically, like I'm hearing it with my ears, but more like the idea of sound was placed into my head. I have come down since I started typing, so I have basically forgotten what I meant by a train car, or what the hell a nishgus is.</blockquote>
It's now about 8 minutes after the hit, I still have a decent afterglow =D
<p>Btw, this was a fairly mild salvia experience.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Sorry if I sounded like an idiot in that post. It was hard to even type, let alone do so coherently.</p>

        <p>I sort of see what you mean, and am picturing it in my head. You say you cannot describe the curve, does that mean you cannot give any details such as color or location? Was this as in a full size train car, miniature, or bloated? Also, how long does one “hit” last? Would 10x be double of 5x, or are there other factors involved? Also, how old are you? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Sorry if I am bugging you as you already said you cannot give details, but I am just trying to get a better understanding on this subject. Also, it doesn’t sound idiotic at all, it seems to make perfect sense to me.</p>

<p>I enjoy it 100%, so do a few friends(the rest hate it entirely).<br>
I’ve only had one bad trip, which was enough to put me off from salvia for a few months.</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain. People always say it doesn’t exactly feel good, or that it’s easy to get bad trips, etc. When I’m on salvia, there is no such things as “feeling good.” No such things as bad trips, etc. Example, on one of my trips I became a boat ramp for launching boats into the river. I was just this massive concrete ramp. I didn’t know who I was(in reality) and had no past memories, I never existed. There was no such things as “feelings.” I was just this boat ramp, and that’s all I ever knew. My past memories were being a boat launch for eternity. I was just a simple ramp, nothing else to it. Since I was just a ramp, there was no such things as emotions such as fear, or even being happy. If that somehow made sense in anyway, theres just so much more to it then what I can explain.</p>
<p>A lot of my salvia trips are like that(although not as boring as it sounds). The part I enjoy is the “what the fuck just happened!?!” factor that you have at the end.</p>
<p>edit: Btw, just ordered 2 grams of 40x.</p>

        <p>Yeah I know exactly what you’re saying, salvia completely destroys the concept of time or emotion. The first few times I tried salvia (10x), it was horrible. One time I remember feeling like I was a book, on a bookshelf, wedged in amongst the other books. I felt entirely trapped, and I made the mistake of attempting to escape (at the time, I had no knowledge I was tripping or what was happening, but I was trying to resist the feeling). A paid commercial was on at the time (it seems TV is VERY bad for salvia), and the voice of the speaker on the paid commercial “bled” over into the salvia trip (similar to how noises “bleed” over into a dream), and he became the “host” of the experience. I had no idea what he was saying, but I recognized his presence. I gave up on salvia, and I am just now giving it another try.</p>
<p>I tried salvia again, however these last few times I was in a much more comfortable environment. I have been doing it an night, in my room with nothing but candle light, and sitting on a pile of blankets (to simulate a bean-bag chair). And now it seems the deeper I go into the experience, the happier I feel. I mean, they seem as if they are in direct proportion. Then at some point I lose touch with emotion, and then about 2 minutes later I begin to re-enter reality with that “what the fuck…?” feeling.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
And Jme, you should try 80x <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/wink1bce.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> if you can find it.

        <p>Shipping is not really an option, I would have nowhere to ship it to. So, I am forced to spend the outrageous price of $10-20 (it varies) a gram of 5x, or $15-40 for 10x at a headshop.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
I just smoked salvia, I will attempt to explain my experience the best I can. I got a large hit of 5x, and sat with my head between by knees (for some reason, this position is mentally comforting while on salvia). Then a figure greeted me. He was very colorful, and only the uper half of his body existed. His were arms were out, pointing to a building which at the time I recognised as the “entrance” to the experience. I can’t explain his arm position, but I could draw it in paint if need be. His upper arm stretched out over his head in, well…multiple arms, if that makes sense. So his upper arm extended over his head, and in the palm of his hand, there was the base of another arm, and that repeated about 5 times, so he had a 5 segment-long multi-arm. Anyways, he directed me into the building. Everything (including the previous character) had a string-like feel to it. What I would describe as the “hostess” of this building showed me a display of colorful strings, that danced and moved around playfully. While this was happening, all characters jumped up and down playfully, in a way I really cannot describe. While on the trip, the “sound” my mind assigned to describe the jumping was “womp”. Every time the characters jumped/hopped (they did so repeatedly), I sort of experienced the sound “womp”. This lasted about 10 more seconds, and the experience was starting to fade.</p>
<p>I don’t know if any of that made sense.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Here was my attempt to illustrate the trip:<br>

        <p>Well there’s no more mushrooms or acid in town, doesn’t sound like there will be for a while.</p>
<p>I’ve been wanting to have a powerful “weird” trip. Something like DXM. So I bought a bottle of syrup, with over 800 mg’s worth of DXM in it. I will either do a freebase extraction or an agent lemon extraction, and dose the entire yield.</p>
<p>I’m kind of tired of just giggling with friends and stuff, and would like to trip out alone. So I’m doing this tomorrow night. I’m going to smoke weed with it, hopefully it kills the nausea. I’ll probably have some ginger ale or ginger root as well. The nausea is hell for me, so I want to do everything I can to get rid of it. This will be my largest DXM dose yet. I pretty much forget the feeling, so it should be a pretty weird night lol.</p>

<p>800 mg’s is a pretty large amount, but it’s not exactly dangerous. The risk of death really only starts around 2,500 mg’s. Heh, the medical dose is like 15 mg’s <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>About salvia, salvia has different effects on everyone so it’s not the same for all, but you described it very well. That happens to me almost every time, you’re just lost in a different reality and the real one doesn’t exist, and never has. You have no idea who you are, and don’t have memories. Appearntly, according to <a href="http://erowid.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">erowid.org</a>, people have lived an entire lifetime as a different person while on salvia, all within 5-20 minutes. That must be really crazy.</p>
<p>The difference between a 10x and a 40x dose, is pretty much what bobby said. It’s 4 times more of a dose, so yes it is much stronger. My first few times, I had done 5x and 10x just a couple of times. When I moved up to 20x, it was entirely different and scared me away from it for many months.

<p>1x would basically be regular leaves from the salvia plant. Most people are unable to experience to effects from this, as a large amount would have to be smoked really quickly. Even with 5x and 10x, many people are unable to “break through” or trip out. However, there is a common way of doing it. You wrap the leaves into a quid, and chew on them for something like 20 minutes, I forget. The effects will last much longer, but probably won’t be as intense. This was a very common practice for thousands of years. I’m not sure if your weight has much influence, but to be honest I doubt it.</p>
<p>Salvia is a very strange drug and very little is known about it and how it works. It’s much different than other drugs. There’s some weird things about it too, for instance the reverse-tolerance phenomenon. Usually after a lot of usage of a drug, you will need to do a higher dose to achieve the effects you used to get. With salvia it’s the opposite, the more you do the less you will need.</p>

        <p>Oh okay, so it is somewhat like a completely lucidity free dream, except more intense and seems more believable while experiencing it? I must say the experiences I have read here of Salvia seem much more serious compared to a drug like LSD, but in a good way. Is it harmful to yourself in any way? I would love to understand more about this drug in particular, as it sticks out so much more from the others.</p>

The closest I’ve ever come to taking drugs is accidentally taking 200 mg of levothyroxine instead of 100 because I forgot I had already taken it <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> [it’s medical, of course]</p>

<p>As long as you’re in good mental health, there’s not really any problems it can cause. It’s not addictive and there’s no known health risks really. There hasn’t been a large amount of research, but nothing has proved it to be unhealthy.</p>
<p>I’ve only used it over 10 times, but definitely have not noticed any after effects from it. The only dangers from this drug that I see is the fact that you lose complete control. You may think your in your bedroom tripping out when in reality you’re dancing naked in the traffic. Thats why it’s good to have a sober trip sitter.</p>
