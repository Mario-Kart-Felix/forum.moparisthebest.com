<p>From what I’ve seen you get 1-10 year(s) for possession of weed, not a fine and community service.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example if it is your first offense (no prior convictions) and if less than 50 kilograms of marijuana are involved, then you are subject to imprisonment of not more than 5 years, a fine of $250,000, or both. If however, all other factors are the same as in the previous example, but 50-100 kilograms of marijuana are involved instead of 50, you are subject to imprisonment of not more than 20 years, unless death or serious injury results from the marijuana use, then you are subject to not less that 20 years or life, a fine of $1,000,000, or both. While the penalties for simple possession are less severe, the first conviction still carries a sentence of up to a year imprisonment, a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $100,000, or both. With regard to simple possession, the number of convictions makes both the minimum period of imprisonment and fines greater. Under special provisions for possession of crack, a person may be sentenced to a mandatory term of at least 5 years in prison and not more than 20 years, a fine of $250,000, or both.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Harsh mandatory minimum sentencing laws for drug offenses result in prisons overfilled with non-violent marijuana offenders serving long sentences, often disproportionate to their crime. Take, for example, the case of Joe Pinson, convicted in 1993 of marijuana cultivation and possession - his first offense - and sentenced to a mandatory five-year jail term, despite the fact that he grew the marijuana because it helped treat his debilitating asthma symptoms.</p>

Usually a fine, community service, or stuff like that. Of course, one of my friends is in jail right now (not juvy, hes 18) and is in for 10 years because he had 3 pounds on him and was going to sell it.</p>

^^^^^ right there is the truth.<br>
My moms ex boyfriend had cancer, and it made him not want to eat with the kilotherapy and all. But he did Marijuana while on it, and it got him to eat. Hes still alive today but his cancer is also gone( not thanks to the marijuana, to the doctors who found it early)<br>
Another bad drug is Asprin. I know guys who do it i dont udnerstand why. My mom tells me that it makes your stomach bleed and does other undesirible effects. So not all Medicinal medicines are good for you.</p>

Vancouver, or pretty much B.C, simply does not enforce it strictly.</p>
<p>There seems to be a lot of information on the net saying that several provinces have struck down on the possesion laws. I’m not sure where this is coming from, but feel free to check the criminal code. Possesion laws are a federal issue, not provincial.<br>

Smoking pot in public, and intent to sell is the only illegal part.<br>
You don’t get a criminal record for possession of mj anymore. You will just be watched more closely.</p>

<p>Hell, I know they are from 2003, but there is not update saying against. The law was reformed in 2003, and hasn’t changed since.</p>
<p>-Mh[/quote]</p>
<p>Those are the sites I found as well.</p>
<p>But, looking through the CDSA and The Criminal Code of Canada,</p>
<blockquote>SCHEDULE II
<p>(Sections 2, 3, 4 to 7, 10, 29, 55 and 60)</p>
<ol>
<li>Cannabis, its preparations, derivatives and similar synthetic preparations, including:</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) Cannabis resin</p>
<p>(2) Cannabis (marihuana)</p>
<p>(3) Cannabidiol (2–[3–methyl–6--(1–methylethenyl)–2--cyclohexen–1--yl]–5--pentyl–1,3–benzenediol)</p>
<p>(4) Cannabinol (3–n--amyl–6,6,9–trimethyl–6--diben- zopyran–1--ol)</p>
<p>(5) Nabilone ((±)–trans–3--(1,1–dimethylheptyl) --6,6a,7,8,10,10a–hexahydro–1--hydroxy–6,6–dime- thyl–9H–dibenzo[b,d]pyran–9--one)</p>
<p>(6) Pyrahexyl (3–n--hexyl–6,6,9–trimethyl–7,8,9,10–tetrahydro–6--dibenzopyran–1--ol)</p>
<p>(7) Tetrahydrocannabinol (tetrahydro–6,6,9–trimethyl–3--pentyl–6H–dibenzo[b,d]pyran–1--ol)</p>
<p>but not including</p>
<p>(8) Non-viable Cannabis seed, with the exception of its derivatives</p>
<p>(9) Mature Cannabis stalks that do not include leaves, flowers, seeds or branches; and fiber derived from such stalks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the penalities are up to a thousand dollar fine and/or 6 months in prison.<br>
There are many sites that even claim Ontario has made it legal for possession(I think even hightimes tried to say this). I’ve known several people who have gone to court and get fined/criminal records for possesion, none of them had anymore then an ounce. My friends brother got it pretty bad.</p>
<p>Anyways there seems to be a lot of gray areas. All I know is that possesion of marijuana is illegal according to the Criminal Code of Canada. The CCoC accounts federally, not provincially.</p>
<p>Ironically in 5 minutes I am leaving for law class. My teacher wouldn’t know crap though.</p>

Smoking pot in public, and intent to sell is the only illegal part.<br>
You don’t get a criminal record for possession of mj anymore. You will just be watched more closely.</p>

              <p>You do not need drugs to be happy, and you do not have to stop using them to become rich and successful.</p>
<p>I know several lawyers that smoke weed, I’ve almost smoked up with an OPP officer(highway cops in Ontario). I’ve had two teachers that I know for sure smoke weed, and many of my moms friends do it.</p>
<p>My friends dad used to be a very heavy mushroom user. He told us about when he used to work up north for 6 months at a time, he would do mushrooms and watch the northern lights <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> He is currently a real-estate agent who smokes over 2-3 grams a day(of weed). They practically live in a mansion, and are very successful.</p>
<p>For me, pot is much cheaper than alcohol. If I buy half an ounce for 80 dollars or so, I’m only spending less than 3 dollars everytime I want to get stoned. I usally sell half of it in dime bags and make my money back. Alcohol costs me over 20 dollars for 12 beer. And almost 40 dollars if I want a 26oz’er of something that doesn’t taste like crap.</p>
<p>If I drank anywhere as often as I smoke weed, I would be so completely fucked over. Alcohol is much worse for you. If I feel that the weed is not getting me as high, not lasting as long, or my lungs need a break, I will quit for a month. That is what I am currently doing, and usually by the end of the month you feel 100% normal, and you lose all your tolerance to the weed. I’ve been drug free for 9 days now. Usually I smoke weed anywhere from 1-5 times a day.</p>

<p>Wait what? Why the fuck would you rather succeed in a lifestyle something that you yourself wouldn’t feel happy with?</p>
<p>Is that how you define success? With money?</p>
<p>I define being successful with being happy happiness, granted you may need money to achieve some parts of being happy, but to devote your entire life simply to something simply because someone else said it would make you “successful”, well thats just retarded as hell.</p>
<p>Oh and Buzzy, I’m too lazy to pull quotes, but pault is right, mostly because he’s pault, but he’s still right.</p>
