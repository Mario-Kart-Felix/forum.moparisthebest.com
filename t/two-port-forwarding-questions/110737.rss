    <title>Two Port Forwarding Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/two-port-forwarding-questions/110737</link>
    <description>I have started a server, and i think i have edited it very well, and I&#39;m ready to let other people join. The only thing is, I have to port forward. Now I know what to do and stuff. Port forwarding is letting people into your computer. I am worried that if they can get in to my computer, they can screw things up. I know they can only get in through moparscape, but is it possible from there they can screw up things on my computer?

Second Question, Let&#39;s say they can&#39;t, but how much download/upload will having, say, 20 players on my server use?</description>
