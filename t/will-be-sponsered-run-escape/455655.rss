260GB Storage
3250GB Bandwidth
Company: Vpsland

Some Server features:
Revision:
317 Pi
Basics(Stand out):
Fire-making completely clipped, npcs completely clipped, Castle wars completely done, everything works skill wise, all minigames no dupes, modes when starting a character, depending on mode i.e. easy or hard is the skill xp and what you can get in shops; also the modes required one highscores per each mode, and i have already decided to have one world per mode each mode gets three worlds, in 2009 xurses was one of the first to connect two worlds together, and some of this team is from that group, achievements, GE maps where added and look/work perfect, made for a skilling/pk server, donator items are nontraditional or only they can wield and no rares will be seen ingame until this Halloween, which a few easter egg surprises will be added for each holiday only once though, by Halloween we expect to have at least 100 players online because of our sponsors. after the year 2013 is over people will only see regular holiday events (yes, i ripped the idea off from runescape). so this is the year to join.
