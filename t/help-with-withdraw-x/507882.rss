    <title>Help with withdraw X</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-withdraw-x/507882</link>
    <description>Hello reader

I&#39;m currently working with Sk8rdude on a bug which involves withdrawing items. Whenever you withdraw an item from your bank and the amount in your bag and the amount you want to withdraw is greater than the max value of an integer, it will remove the remainder between the sum and the max value of an int from your bank, without saying your inventory is full. Now I managed to fix this if you want to withdraw 1, 5, 10 or all, but not if you withdraw X.

I spoke with Arham about this, and he said there was a method to check the amount people give in and it returns an amount, but which method is this? If I would know it, I could solve this easily.

Thanks in advance

          <blockquote>
              <p>How is it horribly worded…? Take an example with it:</p>
<p>You have 100M in your inventory, you wish to withdraw 2.1B from your bank, which totals up to 2.2B. Now every item can have a maximum amount which is equal to the max value of an integer (like 2,147,###,###). So what would happen is, I’d get 2.147B in my inventory, but the other 53M will vanish.</p>
