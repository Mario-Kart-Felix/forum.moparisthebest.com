    <description>[b]Hello everyone you might not of heard of me before. But i am a new coder.
I hope all of you can get a chance to know a lil bit about me and what i do.
I am a java/html coder/programmer.
I am 16 almost 17 years young  ;) and i currently have a beautiful daughter and girlfriend i love and take care of. But i can still code and program =).
The reason i am posting here today is because i am currently working on a server that will be hopefully be playable here in a few days.

But right now. I need a few things for this to be complete.

1. A hoster.
If anyone would like to help me out with this server i am currently working on please ill post how to contact me on the bottom.
2. A backup coder/Co-Coder.
Just in case i aint there, there will be a coder to help out with problems.

The hoster will host the server for us and will get paid half of the donations that we get from players. And also will get admin.
The backup coder/Co-Coder will get admin of course and will help code things into the server and also fix bugs and glitches in the server that he/she finds and or other players and so will get paid off some of my cut from the donations and also will help with the website/programs.

Im sorry but right now there will be no down payment at the moment. But will surely get paid i promise you that.

Thats all i will be needing at the moment.

The server will be great.! And will be available for all of you to play here soon.

The server will have lots of features below is a few features off the top of my head.

The server is a 317.

Features:
Christmas Event from 2007.
Perfect Combat
Party room (Thanks [color=yellow]Canownueasy[/color])
PVP and NVP
Skillcapes (No emotes yet)
All runescape NPC&#39;s in correct spots some custom
Custom Home
All combat following
100% Pest Control
8-10 quests that take 3+ hours!
ALOT MORE.

Sorry for no pictures but i will post some when server comes out!.

Im hoping to finish this by tomarrow or the next day. If you are willing to help me in this project then contact me with the information below.
