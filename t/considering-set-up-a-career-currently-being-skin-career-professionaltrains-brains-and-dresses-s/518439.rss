Are boys born loving trains and guns while girls grab dolls and pretty pink dresses? Are boys born with various brains, enabling them while in the fields of math and science, while girls naturally score well in literature as well written word? 
 
You might consider remember, in 2005, at the time the president of Harvard regain, Lawrence Summers, created an uproar with disparaging comments about women&#39;s aptitude for science and math. Well, it is typically true you will dramatically more men than women in top levels of the science fields, they&#39;re the gender differences hard-wired? 
 
This debate has raged on for many years, the age-old nature versus nurture, science-brain versus art/literature-brain. Studies have produced a wealth of is caused by various studies, often conflicting, along with the matter remains removed from resolved. 
 
Studies show that American girls around between 9 and 17 consistently had fewer experiences the science realm than boys, and usually expressed negative perceptions and attitudes toward science and math classes. Lawrence H. Summers, then president of Harvard, made his notorious comments about women&#39;s aptitude - studies have been surfing for ways in other words why on the market more men than women through the top ranks of science. 
 
Explaining this gender gap away by using the cry: &quot;brain differences!&quot; just should not wash, however. Recent research on gender to have skills in math was completed in 86 countries. End result strongly suggest that culture certainly is the culprit, not brain differences, until finally this difference will not likely biological, but sociocultural. Some countries simply do not show this gap that is apparent in the states, plus it seems in countries where females are comfy and successful in the arena of math, you&#39;ll find greater degree of gender equality. For illustration, in Russia and Asia girls expenditure in technologies prone to pursue scientific careers when compared to american, Canada and England. 
 
But in america, the gap happens to be narrowing. Girls who ? re thought of as &quot;highly gifted mathematicians&quot; now number 3 one, huge improvement upon the 13 to one ratio the final in the 1970s.
