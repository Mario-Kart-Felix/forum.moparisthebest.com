    <title>[Delta] Help with combat + firecape [Delta]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-help-with-combat-firecape-delta/364030</link>
    <description>Hi guys, first post i was a member of google but theyre community sucks. Anyway onto the point i have a delta based source proper GS stances claw specs GS specs and everything REALLY great server. But theres three problems i have, 

1) It takes ages to attack someone/NPC once youve already clicked attack. Anyway to fix this?

[s]2) if you get a firecape and wear it, logout, then log back in, the firecape disappears?[/s]

3) I get alot of lag on my server, no players just me and a mate. Is this my computer and if i buy a vps will this be fixed? or is this the source. Because it does have customs (wouldnt know how to remove)

Any ideas?</description>

<p>Ive also forgot to add another problem, i get alot of lag on my server, no players just me and a mate. Is this my computer and if i buy a vps will this be fixed? or is this the source. Because it does have customs like bandos warspear but i wouldnt know how to remove them, only been coding for around a month  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
