    <title>Endacia Craft - The One Server You Can Keep &lt;3</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/endacia-craft-the-one-server-you-can-keep-3/395006</link>
    <description>[i]You remember that one server you just can&#39;t leave? You can&#39;t forget? That&#39;s us.
Welcome to Endacia Craft.[/i]

Endacia Craft is a building server. No monsters, no animals, you can build what you want, when you want without being bothered by a spider or a creeper, and with active people and friendly mods, how could you say no?

Don&#39;t worry about your house being destroyed, it can all be protected.
Want to make a town? Add more people to the protection!

Admin/Mod not online? We have LWC!

Tired of just plain redstone but don&#39;t like dozens of new features you can&#39;t keep up with? We&#39;ve covered that too ;)

Now, this is a new server on a fresh landscape, but I believe I finally found that ONE seed that has JUST the right amount of mountains, flatland, islands, and water.

Commands/Rules/Plugins all stated in spawn.

Hope to see you on online!
