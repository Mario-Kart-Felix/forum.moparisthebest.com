    <title>iPhone and iTunes - New computer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/iphone-and-itunes-new-computer/274732</link>
    <description>My mum just got a Mac for her bday and wants to transfer all the files (pics, songs) from her old library to her new one on the Mac. I figured the easiest way to do this was to just put all pics and songs on an external HD and transfer across. She also wants to transfer all of her e-mail contacts from her iPhone to the new iTunes and I was wondering whether this was possible? I think it&#39;s pretty stupid that Apple doesn&#39;t let you upload the songs on your iPod, but I wasn&#39;t sure whether you could or couldn&#39;t with e-mail addresses. 

Any help will be much appreciated :)

              <p>if you take all the files over via external then take the itunes extra files over like the itunes library and so on, and the backups for the ipod and if you set it up right on the mac it should recognize it like it did on the old PC. I’m not sure how macs do their local app file storage but that will be the key to getting the contacts and everything over because they will be stored as backups in case you want to restore your iphone</p>
