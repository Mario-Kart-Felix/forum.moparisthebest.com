    <title>NPC Combat 508</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-combat-508/301793</link>
    <description>okay, so i added npc combat (YAY) but its not working out so well, i cannot mage/range the npc&#39;s and prayer doesnt work. also special attacks dont work
and is there anyway i can down there defense level? because its almost impossible to hit on the npc&#39;s at the moment
you might want to see this, this is in my playercombat.java

[CODE]	public void attackNpc() {
	if (p.combatDelay == 0) {
			p.weapon = p.equipment[3];
			p.strengthBonus = p.equipmentBonus[10];
			p.oppIndex = p.enemyIndex;
		NPC n = Server.engine.npcs[p.attackNpc];
		if (p == null || n == null || n.isDead || n.currentHP &lt;= 0) {
			p.attackNpc = 0;
			p.requestFaceTo(65535);
			p.resetAttack();
			return;
		}
		}[/CODE]

i added that. would i do the same thing to playermagic.java?
if that has anything to do with it at all ^^

to put this more clearly. ill set it out.
1)no range on npc. the hits dont show
2)no mage on npc the hits dont show
3)The specials dont REALLY work on npc&#39;s somehow the ags special worked just before, but it never did before that.
4)The npc&#39;s defense levels; is there a way i can make there defense lower so people can actually hit them?
5)How do i change the drops and how often they appear?
6)How do i change the exp rate on them for training.

I am using a z508 source
and i think thats it thanks for looking.
please help.
thanks,
