Just because your strong doesn’t mean you can take a punch. Or land a punch for that matter. I hate when people see someone whos ripped, and instantly say "Damn he could kick anyones ass " etc</p>

Gymnastics doesn’t get you too ‘ripped’ really, by the time he is 16 he will probably just have an amazingly toned body.</p>
