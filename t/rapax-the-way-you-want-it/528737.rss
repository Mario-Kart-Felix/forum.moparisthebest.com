    <title>Rapax - The way you want it</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rapax-the-way-you-want-it/528737</link>
    <description>[i]I didn&#39;t know where to post this, so I dropped it here. 
I was thinking about posting this on Gamedev.Moparscape.org, but since there&#39;s nobody really active there, I dropped it here.[/i]

[b]Introduction[/b]
-Rapax is going to be a Modder&#39;s group.-
It&#39;s since a few months that I&#39;m modding games now. 
I&#39;m actually looking for a small modding team that mods games like:
-Mount and Blade: Warband
-Rome Total War
-maybe Private Servers

Now I&#39;m working on a mod called Rome Total War: Zombie Invasion. 

[b]applications[/b]
I&#39;m in need of a moddeler and a website developer.
If you&#39;re interested apply in one of the comments. 
Just tell me your age, experience, ...

[i]I typed this on my Ipod, sorryfor spelling mistakes. 
I&#39;ll include media of my -first- mod this or next week.[/i]</description>
