    <title>IP Connecting Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ip-connecting-problem/443692</link>
    <description>I have a problem connecting my client to the source. The client already works with 127.0.0.1, but when I change it to my IP or my no-ip it [b]DOESN&#39;T[/b] work. I have port forwarded and everything is fine. Canyouseeme.org tells me 43594 is online on my ip &amp; another website told me my no-ip is fine. 

There is no gui or egui or something on my client. The only way to change the ip in my client is by client.java and this is what is shows.

[code]        if(signlink.mainapp != null)
            return signlink.mainapp.getCodeBase();
        try
        {
            if(super.aFrame_Sub1_15 != null)
                return new URL(&quot;http://127.0.0.1:&quot; + (43594 + anInt958));
        }
        catch(Exception _ex) { }
        return super.getCodeBase();[/code]

I change the 127.0.0.1 to my ip and no-ip and it doesn&#39;t log me in, not even a character log in log in my cmd from my run server that shows someone is trying to log in.</description>

              <p>There might be a few problems something is interfering with your port’s, or you didnt portfoward right even though the port might be open you probably didnt portforward right.</p>
<p>Search for Server = in your client.java and there should be 2 spots to put your ip into <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
