              <p>You’ve provided almost no information regarding your problem. Is the problem regarding execution, when you launch the client? Are you using a batch script to open the client, such as run.bat? If it is closing (won’t open) as soon as you open it, add the “PAUSE” at the end of the batch script, save, run again and post what prints out. Other then that, no one can help you without more information.</p>
