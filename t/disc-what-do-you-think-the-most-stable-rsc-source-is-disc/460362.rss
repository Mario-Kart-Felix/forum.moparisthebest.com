    <title>[DISC] What do you think the most stable RSC source is? [DISC]</title>

    <description>What overall, disregarding expertise needed to operate, is the [i]best[/i] RSC server out there to base a server upon? Do not flame against others in this topic, it is merely for personal opinions.

If your answer is MoparClassic, explain exactly why you believe its better than other sources. What can it do that others cannot?
This topic has nothing to do with how much programming experience one needs, just solely which is the strongest, most stable source. Back up your answers. Ill make a poll for this topic later if it gets popular</description>

              <p>hard to say as pretty much all of them need a little bit of work. i haven’t compiled and ran MoparClassic for a long time so i can’t say, but i do know DQ is not very good straight out of the box, it’s great with a little bit of work.</p>
<p>then you got EasyRsc which is alright out of the box, lacking hundreds of updates from the RSCA era though. truth is everything you get is going to need some work in some form or another as time goes on.</p>
