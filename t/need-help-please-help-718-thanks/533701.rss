    <description>Hello everybody, I have a problem. You may also think that I&#39;m stupid. How can I make myself an owner? I know it only from the character file. But from my source, you can not use the character file.I&#39;ve tried it from many different ways but it does not work and I&#39;ve also tried it from the player.java file. but it still will not work.
And I have compiled, but it still will not work :/
Is there any other ways? be please to send them to me.
Thank you.</description>

playerRights = 7;</code></p>
