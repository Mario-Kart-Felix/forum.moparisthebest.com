    <title>Need help with client/server (connection problem)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-client-server-connection-problem/371285</link>
    <description>I would like all coders to help me find out what is the problem that don&#39;t let me connect to my server it only lets trough localhost I tested on my friends computer and it wont let me connect to it I have portforwarded and this isn&#39;t my first server but I don&#39;t know what to do never have had this kind of problem

I used Innovation X No Leach and it works about 99% because if you try to change the client ip that it connects to then it doesn&#39;t change and the server itself doesn&#39;t bind to a port you can have a server running already and you will still be able to connect to the server so I don&#39;t really know what to do I have never had any experience fixing this problem I have tried to fix it for a couple weeks now.
