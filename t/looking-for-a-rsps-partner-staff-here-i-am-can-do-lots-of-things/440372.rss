    <description>[b]Hi there! :D[/b]
Well for starters, let me just introduce myself.
[i]Im Lee, 17 from Doncaster, England. Have played private servers for about 3-4years ago. Obviously started off when i heard about &#39;Frugooscape&#39;. 
I have coded a private servers before which was delta-based (317) which got to the peak of about 40-50 players active at one time, with over 2,000 accounts created. Although i just didnt have enough spare time due to exams(which are all finished now). I have experianced what its liked to own a server, and now would just like to be part of the team.[/i]

[i]I would like to apply for in-game mod/admin/co-owner (just depending on what you want me to do, etc..), then once ive proved myself worthy, would love to work my way up the team. (in-game + forms).[/i]

[b]A few reasons to why you might want to partner with me/ have me in your team!:[/b]
[i]*I would play &#39;YOUR SERVER&#39; approx. 4hours per day monday to friday, then between 20-30 hours on the throughout the weekend. 
[u]excluding a few days (for my life)[/u]
*i Would stay active online fourms aswell, getting rid of junk (spam) and answering questions.
*I would create advertisments, eg- on different fourms, videos (youtube) and get the word out there for players/promotional purposes.
* I can created banners etc, using &#39;Photoshop, illustrator, fireworks, etc..&#39;
* FULL of idea&#39;s!
* In-game i will always be there for help, but will NOT abuse my powers. 
* I do not like giving away free stuff as this ruins the econemy.
* Another good reason is that since i live in england, the time scale will be different to others, so i could be there when you aren&#39;t (if your from USA).
* Also, can keep the advertisment on &#39;runelocus, rune-server, mopar etc..&#39; up to date :-) (even write them for you)
* I can help with coding (JAVA)
* I am able to create &#39;good-standard&#39; websites, through html coding.
* I can make your server forums (if you have none)
* ALWAYS HERE TO HELP WITH ALOT OF THINGS![/i]

[b][b]If you would like more infomation, please do contact me via PM or comment below! [/b] 
Hope to hear from you soon!
Lee![/b]</description>
