    <title>Client Handler: Accpeted From</title>

    <description>Starting TestScape Server on 0.0.0.0:43594
ClientHandler: Accepted from (ip)22887
ClientHandler: Accepted from (ip)22887

ClientHandler: Accepted from (ip)22897

Alright so I was port forwarding, After I finished I wanted to check and make sure that I port forwarded right. When I went to login, after I have attempted a few other tries, My run.bat sent me the message above.

Also Yes I have tested this on another server to make sure that it wasn&#39;t the server.  Another thing, I am able to connect throught localhost (127.0.0.1).  
[b]PLEASE DO NOT POST SOMETHING LIKE &quot;Use Hamachi&quot;...  If I wanted to use hamachi then I wouldn&#39;t have even posted this thread![/b]</description>
