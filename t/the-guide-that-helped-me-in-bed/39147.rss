    <description> :| Before you start blabering how sick I am, let&#39;s start with some rules. 1:People who are more interested in being a virgen than becoming a man then GET THE F¥¢K OUT!!!! 2:Don&#39;t criticize me.I got this info from my pervert of a friend. 3:If you&#39;re still here that means that want to be and you want your woman to take you into bed every night. So for fuck&#39;s sake do&#39;nt be a faggot.And one more thing,I take no credit in this. Click here  http://www.fleshlight.com/legendsgym/index.php     


Oh yeah,my psp is the only way i can acces the internet,so &quot;typing&quot; is&#39;nt exactly one of my things.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Ron, post:2, topic:39147”]lol fuck that man. When I was little, I read my dad’s Kama Sutra. That explains something like 143 sex positions and like 5000 ways to turn yourself and partner on lol. Indians know how to screw.</p>
<p>If you want to learn about sex and everything about it, download/buy the Indians version of the Kama Sutra. Don’t get the british copy, because they changed it around a bit and took some fun stuff out. :rolleyes:[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh wow, you’re so cool Ron!</p>

<p>lol clearly you have never met a real indian or not tried it correctly. You gotta be indian for it to work right. Fyi they don’t teach you how to get laid, they teach you how to increase sexual arousal exponentially. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

When I was little, I read my dad’s Kama Sutra. That explains something like 143 sex positions and like 5000 ways to turn yourself and partner on lol. Indians know how to screw.</p>
<p>If you want to learn about sex and everything about it, download/buy the Indians version of the Kama Sutra. Don’t get the british copy, because they changed it around a bit and took some fun stuff out. :rolleyes:[/quote]Indians suck at getting laid I tried that stuff already, asian ppl really know the guide</p>
