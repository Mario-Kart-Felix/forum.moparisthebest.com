    <title>So I Want to Host a Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-i-want-to-host-a-server/477639</link>
    <description>But I can&#39;t pay for a dedi or VPS. The type of server I&#39;m developing would surely be fairly popular, and Rarity is good enough to be hosted on a poor computer and still handle a good amount of players, but my internet isn&#39;t reliable enough and I don&#39;t have a spare monitor/mouse/keyboard. I have a bank account, but PayPal isn&#39;t an option due to various reasons. I&#39;m not exactly looking to make money with the server, just a way to pay for hosting. What are some things you guys do/have done that haven&#39;t crapped out on you in a month because the company you were with decided to fuck you over?

Thanks,

~Lin</description>

I’m a staffhunting “mong” really?<br>
It’s a form of payment, in which Lin has every right to revoke if I were to go ‘mad with power’ or not meet up to the standards.<br>

What are the specs you will be looking for?<br>
[/quote]Windows XP SP3 or above for the operating system (Windows Server 2003 should work if it can run the .NET Framework 4.0), single core processor clocked at about 1GHz+ and 512MB+ RAM.

<p>Really the best you can do right now is computer host it if someone is nice enough to give you access to their computer. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>You may also find someone with a vps their not using and give you access for a certain fee, but once you’re able to get a little money for the server it should be a bit easier since you could set up an ad scene.</p>

Borrow money from a family member then pay them back with irl money. Get the server a little bit known about and people usually offer payment/a donation in advance. Since your good at programming you could programme for irl gps on R-S though… You can get 1 month VPSs from $5+ that are able to host RSPSs until you can get enough money for a better one. I’m assuming you want a VPS for it as your going to have people playing on it while you improve it?<br>
[/quote]Well the problem with donations is payment services don’t like the word “donation” if you offer anything in return. I guess the advice I’m looking for is how to accept payments and what payment service I can use.[/quote]<br>
You could do a paypal bridge (what I call it). Make a dummy e-mail and a paypal with it. Have all payments go to that, and send money from that one to your real one.<br>
That’s the best method I can think of, and it’s never failed me.</p>

It’s an offer. I can set up the computer for a person and take the monitor off, and throw it in my closet so I won’t be tempted to use.<br>
Plus, it’s better than charging X amount of dollars for it. I’ve already port forwarded it and it’s got a static IP. My internet never goes offline. But hey, it’s his pick.</p>

<p>I work part time as a technician and any supposedly “bust” computers customers no longer want, need or can’t fund for repairs are in my loft.</p>
<p>Every time I need to host I hook it up to my smallscreen monitor under my desk and host 24/7 on one of them.</p>

I’ve got a spare computer not doing anything right now. It’s got 6GBS RAM, and hasn’t been shut off since I booted it up… If you’d like to use it; I just require Admin+ on the server <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
