        <p>Pyru is a poor man.  He has lost a lot of worldly possessions recently, and is thus spiraling into a lying, conning, stealing, and ultimately terrible sociopath.</p>
<p>I have worked for him, until I realized he would never give return on things he promises to.</p>
<p>Even if he does, he will attempt to steal it back.  I can provide evidence of this behavior here:</p>
<p><code>[19:57:10] Dustin Harrison: mmhmm....
[19:57:16] Dustin Harrison: time to charge back paypal
[19:57:19] Dustin Harrison: cya mark</code></p>
<p>Then this happens:<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/nzgadJj.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>You see the pattern here?  This will occur.  Everytime you ever work with Pyru, this will occur.  If you choose to work with him, he will take advantage of you.  You can count on him to take advantage of others for you in ways that he doesn’t understand sometimes, but he’ll always try to take the upper hand in every situation and will cruelly, capriciously cut your share out.</p>
<p>There’s a reason all of his developers stopped doing things for him.</p>
<p>He is living in his mothers trailer, after his female claimed his child was not his and left him.  He lost his car.  He is absurdly poor, and has become desperate to a huge fault.</p>
<p>If you trust him, you will be the fool and he will be acting like a fool, for he simply thinks he can have it all without giving back at all.</p>
<p>I recommend strict avoidance, or try to take advantage of his lying in benign ways that he will miss due to his own narcissism.</p>
<p>Remember folks, people lie, and you do too.</p>

        <p>The funny thing is, Mark Gore aka Tx, is the one who’s been struggling, and programming for money. I am an honest person, and that’s one trait about me that differs the person I am from who Mark Gore Tx is.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ThNR6vgl.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>That is the truth. He did some work for me yes, he stated he added malicious code in to my server source (which he did not), and expects me to not charge back? Get a grip, this is the real world, you make claims you’re profiting off of doing shit wrongfully to an honest paying person, grow up.</p>
<ul>
<li>And to your points, do I live with my mothers, yes I do (because I gave my ex girlfriend, the mother of my child, the house and every belonging as it was the right thing to do)</li>
<li>Did I lose my car? Nope, I can go outside and take a picture of my car, the car that’s worth 50x the amount of your car Mark (your $500 beater you purchased).</li>
<li>Do I work? Yes I do, I actually have my own home-based business, which allows me the freedom to work on RSCEmulation at the same time. I have linked people to my business, glad I didn’t link Mark, as this is the type of childish stuff he does when he does not get his own way.</li>

        <p>Oh, and by the way, he got mad when I stated I would be outsourcing to stop his bot, and that’s where this pretty much stemmed from, which is why he’s doing what he is now, trying to get people to not play, as he knows I’ll find someone to put a stop to his way of making money online (his codexbot). And I will state bluntly, I do not have the knowledge myself to stop it, I do web applications, but I know there are plenty out there who would be willing to do it for less than marks charged me for simple stuff.</p>

<p>Okay.  So why does that matter?<br>
I mean, he did the work for you, and he claimed to put a sploit in it but you also claim he didn’t.  Okay.  So?  I’m failing to see the problem for you in the situation, Dustin.  You’re saying he lied, which is fine maybe he did I don’t know and I don’t care, the point is he did work for you, and you claim it contains no exploit, and yet you stole the money back?  And this makes YOU the good person here?<br>
You then went on to say to PayPal that he didn’t even do this work for you…  Here’s the evidence.<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XXqrRts.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
This is a lie.  Not to Mark, no.  To PayPal.  This is inherently stealing money back for him doing nothing wrong to you.  Do you get it yet?</p>

<p>I knew all along about Mark, that’s why I would never let him work on the source locally. He only worked on it, while I was at my PC, watching his every move, so I could ensure he wasn’t implementing malicious code. I know what to look for, I’m not illiterate when it comes to programming, although Java isn’t my strong point. Nonetheless, he can say what he needs to, in order to make himself feel better. Fact of the matter is, I’m being honest, he’s lying.</p>

No, I do not want a reiteration brother.  I want an explanation for you lying to PayPal, not to Mark or me or anyone else.  You stole money back from Mark because he lied to someone else about putting sploits in your game, but he did what you asked regardless.  You can audit code, can you not?  You should be able to if you KNOW he’s lying as you claim, and since you KNOW he’s lying, this makes you the wrong-doer, not him.  He’s ruffling your jimmies, nothing else.  He isn’t actually sploiting your game, and you are actually stealing work from him afterward anyway.</p>

Look at the picture I posted with the name <code>Buyer'' in it. You claim to PayPal,</code>developer did not follow through’’.  You also claim to all of us that he did follow through, and that he did lie about adding an exploit.  If you don’t want public humiliation, take this to private conversation with me, else I will keep replying to you with why you’re simply and purely wrong-doing.</p>

<p>Follow through with “some” &lt;-- that’s your keyword there, of the work and terms agreed upon. You can continue to reply, that doesn’t bother me, the fact of the matter is, I canceled the charge back, and stated my reasoning to you why I did so. There shouldn’t be any more conversation about the matter to be honest, especially not with you, as you’re not the one who any of this applies to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I canceled the charge back<br>
This is good.  I’m glad, and would happily work for you if this is actually the thing that has taken place.  Mark has stated to me similarly(in that, he won the chargebacks, which seems justified to me).  My point was just that you made the charge backs in the first place, man.  I’m not trying to defame you on purpose due to actions I’ve not seen, just actions that I have.  I’m being honest the way I know how:  Information given to me.  As I stated in PM, I would like to talk to you privately, for private reasons that would ideally remain private.  I have sent another friend request on Skype, I suggest you talk to me.</p>
