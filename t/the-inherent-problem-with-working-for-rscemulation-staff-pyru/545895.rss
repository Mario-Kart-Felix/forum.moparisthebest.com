    <title>The inherent problem with working for RSCEmulation staff(Pyru)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-inherent-problem-with-working-for-rscemulation-staff-pyru/545895</link>
    <description>Pyru is a poor man.  He has lost a lot of worldly possessions recently, and is thus spiraling into a lying, conning, stealing, and ultimately terrible sociopath.

I have worked for him, until I realized he would never give return on things he promises to.

Even if he does, he will attempt to steal it back.  I can provide evidence of this behavior here:

[code][19:57:10] Dustin Harrison: mmhmm....
[19:57:16] Dustin Harrison: time to charge back paypal
[19:57:19] Dustin Harrison: cya mark[/code]

Then this happens:

You see the pattern here?  This will occur.  Everytime you ever work with Pyru, this will occur.  If you choose to work with him, he will take advantage of you.  You can count on him to take advantage of others for you in ways that he doesn&#39;t understand sometimes, but he&#39;ll always try to take the upper hand in every situation and will cruelly, capriciously cut your share out.

There&#39;s a reason all of his developers stopped doing things for him.

He is living in his mothers trailer, after his female claimed his child was not his and left him.  He lost his car.  He is absurdly poor, and has become desperate to a huge fault.

If you trust him, you will be the fool and he will be acting like a fool, for he simply thinks he can have it all without giving back at all.


I recommend strict avoidance, or try to take advantage of his lying in benign ways that he will miss due to his own narcissism.

Remember folks, people lie, and you do too.</description>

Now go away Zlacki, you’re ban evading. I reported the post where you admitted you were HixK so I’m surprised one of the moderators hasn’t banned you again. Take a hint.</p>

This doesn’t help the situation, guys.  He won’t learn properly unless you are mean to him, whilst explaining why not to ask in the first place.<br>
The relations were set in place already, and he knew the answer, and so did we.  It’s not something that required the explanation, it’s something that required a cruel ``king.’'<br>
Sure makes me look narcissistic, but also stops the question being asked again.</p>

</aside>
<p>Due to the pure level of abstraction in any language but pure machine-code translatable ASM, there will be bugs.  The more abstraction added, the more side effects, the less the bugs make sense.  The more defined, the more bugs make sense, the easier to create them.  Every language has some advantages, disadvantages, except ASM.  I would never use ASM, the closest I’ll get to machine code is C.  Any dialect of C.  C99 is my preference, I can use C89, K&amp;R C, C11, etc.  I choose C99 for it seems the purest to me, and is easiest to make bugs with, but also easiest to identify why bugs exist in.<br>
Languages, in computers, are just like languages, in humans.  The key difference is the human instrumenting the language, and instructing the machine in any which, way, or form.<br>
There are many paths to one road, in all languages.<br>
Nobody is the best programmer, for no human seems to be able to make a decent God(view it as a metaphor before hopping on me for Judeao-Christian analogy) figure.<br>
In fact, all programmers, and all software that you did not 100% write, including anything compiled, SUCKS.<br>
It will SUCK, it will always SUCK, and there will always be things to FIX, if you did not 100% create it YOURSELF, on YOUR MACHINE.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Why are you so mad?[/quote]<br>
I understand that computers are too compliant, and that humans make terrible leaders, is why I appear angry.  It’s actually more a sense of apathy in myself AND others.  I realize we all suck at programming, the idea is to suck…less…<br>
Time is the ONLY factor to consider, here.</p>

Due to the pure level of abstraction in any language but pure machine-code translatable ASM, there will be bugs.  The more abstraction added, the more side effects, the less the bugs make sense.  The more defined, the more bugs make sense, the easier to create them.  Every language has some advantages, disadvantages, except ASM.  I would never use ASM, the closest I’ll get to machine code is C.  Any dialect of C.  C99 is my preference, I can use C89, K&amp;R C, C11, etc.  I choose C99 for it seems the purest to me, and is easiest to make bugs with, but also easiest to identify why bugs exist in.<br>
Languages, in computers, are just like languages, in humans.  The key difference is the human instrumenting the language, and instructing the machine in any which, way, or form.<br>
There are many paths to one road, in all languages.<br>
Nobody is the best programmer, for no human seems to be able to make a decent God(view it as a metaphor before hopping on me for Judeao-Christian analogy) figure.<br>
In fact, all programmers, and all software that you did not 100% write, including anything compiled, SUCKS.<br>
It will SUCK, it will always SUCK, and there will always be things to FIX, if you did not 100% create it YOURSELF, on YOUR MACHINE.[/quote]</p>

When your life is a joke, everything is comedic.<br>
My life is but a joke, and I get things done because I do not take emotion into account in my actions.<br>
Try it, you narcissistic moron.  You focus on yourself being the best at everything, when in fact, computer science isn’t science, it’s art.  Compare it to poetry in English, moron.</p>

<p>The difference between martyrdom and suicide is press coverage, equally so, the difference between me(a generally good person) and you(a generally bad one) is that I admit how fudgeing awful of a person I am, or if you choose to view me otherwise, will admit how generally good of a person I am.
