    <title>Dragon Dagger Double Hit - anyone make this work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dragon-dagger-double-hit-anyone-make-this-work/115850</link>
    <description>I think I have a vague idea of where to put it, I&#39;m just not able to make it hit twice. Can anyone help me on this?

I just need it to hit then follow up with another hit just after, it doesn&#39;t need to be a special attack.</description>
