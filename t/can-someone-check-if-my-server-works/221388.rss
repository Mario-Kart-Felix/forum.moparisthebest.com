    <title>Can someone check if my server works?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-check-if-my-server-works/221388</link>
    <description>Hi, I am using a wireless internet, Not the one with the modem, So I have thus need to use hamachi - Other ways wouldn&#39;t allow others access, So I need someone to see if my server works with hamachi, I know this is part as advertising, But the Hamachi Server status is NEVER up. And the advertising section has nothing in it. 

The IP is - huskyscape.no-ip.info (I can remove this one since I have three)

Please post saying wether you got on or not. There won&#39;t be anything on the server as I do not want to spend lots of time doing something for nothing. I only go through the forums now trying to learn things[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 19, 2008, 02:29:28 AM[/size][hr]Oh sorry,
