    <description>I had downloaded a server and was starting to code it, it was going good and i loved the server but then i tried to re-organize my inventory and it worked except whenever i clicked on an item i moved it wouldnt equip it and then after like a minute everything i re-organized would go back to its original place. Any idea what the problem is? Thanks</description>
