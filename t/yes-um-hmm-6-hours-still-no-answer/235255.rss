Okay guys, I finally got my char screen to work, with ::char command, turns out I wasn&#39;t supposed to use 771 as an interface, it was 3559. Anyway, I&#39;m trying to get it to where when you first log-in, you can&#39;t move until you type ::char and change your characters look. How would I do this? Something like this?

[code]
  	if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Char&quot;)) {
		if (loadgame == 0);
		sM(&quot;You must type ::Char to begin your journey.&quot;);
		showInterface(3559);
                 sM(&quot;Hello&quot;+playerName+&quot;you are now designing your character.&quot;);
                 }else{
		 if (loadgame == 1);
                 sM(&quot;Welcome back&quot;+playerName+&quot;you&#39;ve already characterized your character.&quot;);
			}[/code]

[b]Note:[/b] Please take into consideration I am a [b]basic[/b] coder. :) Thanks.

I keep getting this error and I don&#39;t know how to fix it.

[code]

              <p>My bad, it’s supposed to say loadgame on my command, I forgot to change it. I have this btw, if it helps.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">int loadgame = loadgame(playerName, passHash(playerPass));</code></pre>
<p>&amp;&amp;</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	public int loadgame(String playerName, String playerPass) {
		for (Integer bUid : server.bannedUid) {
			if (uid == bUid.intValue()) {
				return 4;
			}
		}</code></pre>
<p>So I figured, why not use loadgame == 0; to show you’ve just logged in for the first time. Well, when I do that, it says loadgame isn’t declared…so Idk what to do.</p>

where is firstLogin coming from? you would also want it to save char so add saving line. you would have to add firstLogin to player.java so it would save in char file. also make it teleport. when you first login teleblock = true; so make it false when you type char</p>
