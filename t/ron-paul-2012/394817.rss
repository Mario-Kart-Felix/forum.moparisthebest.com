              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:30, topic:394817”]The USA saved all of Europe’s ass twice.  We didn’t have to join WWI at all, and only did so because we got tired of Germany sinking british ships with Americans on them (Lusitania).  We also didn’t have to do anything with Europe in WWII, as you said, the only one who attacked us is Japan, we could have just dealt with them and left you guys alone.  There is also all of the policing NATO has forced us to do for Europe, like all of the crap that went down in former Yugoslavia all those years.</p>
<p>All told the USA has spent countless lives and money in or for Europe over the years, and answer me this, has Europe ever helped the USA at all?  The last time I can even think of European troops being in North America, was when Britain failed at taking back the USA during the war of 1812, and that wasn’t exactly helping the USA, was it?[/quote]</p>
<p>The British Empire was defending the Seas between you, the Germans and the Japanese empire. Of course, not solely - but with the biggest navy in the world, the loss of that would have put the United States at increased risk. The same can be said for the French, a navy that also rivaled the British, German and US navy were also there.</p>
<p>It seems to me that you’re forgetting it was the financial ruin of Europe after WW2 that allowed the United States to become the big dominant superpower it is now, so it you cant think about it as if it is the same US as it is now, you certainly didn’t have the military then that you have now. Of course, it would have taken over eventually anyway, but the war accelerated it very fast, eliminating pretty much all competition. With Britain the only ones were in the way of the Germans taking over Western Europe and the Russians in the East, it wouldn’t have been a great time to be American if they had decided to turn their focus to the US if Britain hadn’t successfully defended against the invasion attempts.</p>
<p>The United States involvement in the war looked minuscule in comparison to the Russian involvement, without the Russians, even with the help of the United States - it would have been much, much harder, and possibly even a loss. At the time (and shortly after the war), the Russians were also seen as the biggest ally of various Western European nations. A survey in Britain asking who they thought Britain’s best ally was, put Russia at the top - it was only afterwards that the “Special relationship” was popularised, with increased focus on similarities in culture and the US aid to Britain in the form of a loan, and continually, British aid most of your wars.</p>
<p>Everyone is thankful for the help brought by the US, but the over importance <span class="bbcode-i">some people</span> put on US involvement and the way you word some things which looks like you’re discrediting the millions of troops who were fighting from the start, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, France, Russia, Britain and shortly after, the Netherlands, is quite insulting.</p>
<p>As for Europe helping USA, helping you various wars you have started since isn’t good enough? Sure, no one has been over in the US defending from an invading enemy, but that is because the country has never experienced that. But you can bet we and various other European countries would be over there in the event of an invasion, regardless of how well equipped you are.</p>

<p>The only reason US joined WWI and WWII was after being provoked. We should thank the Japanese, if they had let pearl harbor be alone, US would just watch Hitler gain power in Europe. OK maybe they would do something, but that would only be because they would see Hitler as a treat.</p>

<p>Afghanistan was basically being ran by a terrorist organization that attacked the USA, so that was fully justified too.[/quote]Afganistan was ran by the Taliban, not Al Quaida. Your entire reason for occupying the country was to destroy a terrorist organization (which you can’t destroy in the first place), remove the government, enforce democracy and then leave.

What about Kosovo and Lebanon?  Those were all started by Europe and finished by the USA, at no advantage to us.</p>
<p>I’m assuming you are talking about the current Afghanistan and Iraq war though.  Saddam Hussein in Iraq should have been overthrown years ago, but his people couldn’t do it, so we helped them out.  Again it wasn’t really our business, but we helped out less fortunate people who were getting murdered by the thousands at no advantage to us, only a large cost of life and money.  Afghanistan was basically being ran by a terrorist organization that attacked the USA, so that was fully justified too.</p>

The USA saved all of Europe’s ass twice.  We didn’t have to join WWI at all, and only did so because we got tired of Germany sinking british ships with Americans on them (Lusitania).  We also didn’t have to do anything with Europe in WWII, as you said, the only one who attacked us is Japan, we could have just dealt with them and left you guys alone.  There is also all of the policing NATO has forced us to do for Europe, like all of the crap that went down in former Yugoslavia all those years.</p>
<p>All told the USA has spent countless lives and money in or for Europe over the years, and answer me this, has Europe ever helped the USA at all?

<p>That’s quite a backwards union. Here, unions are there to make sure the situation for the workers improves constantly. Of course, this doesn’t mean that salary’s rise with huge amounts every year, but the minimum is inflation correction. In rare occasions the wages are frozen for a year, for instance when a large company is almost bankrupt and needs to reorganize heavily. Unions don’t take that, but also understand that when they demand that no jobs are lost, the company goes bankrupt.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:15, topic:394817”]<a class="mention" href="/u/yakman">@Yakman</a>, unions are basically useless though, or at least the ones I’ve had experience with.</p>
<p>One example is when I worked at a large supermarket called Meijer (think walmart, just in the midwest instead of all over).  We had a union, and the only thing they did the entire 4 years I worked there was negotiate to lower every hourly worker’s wages by about $1 an hour.  What a great union!</p>
<p>Bottom line, all current unions are useless.[/quote]</p>
