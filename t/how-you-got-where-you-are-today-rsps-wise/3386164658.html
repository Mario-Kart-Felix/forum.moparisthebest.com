my friend told me about it<br>
[/quote]damn, that took forever to read.[/quote]Ok, in that case, short story long:</p>
<p>It was about two years ago. My neighbor friend (who had never before cheated on RuneScape) stumbled on the MoparScape client link while search for fast ways to make money on runescape. He called me and started telling me about this place where you could play by yourself and have whatever items you wanted. Neither of us had any idea what this was, but I went over to check it out. I already had a few years programming experience (even though it wasn’t in Java) and was intrigued. Back at home I was learning more and more about Java and RSPS by surfing these forums, and I finally download and started my own 317 server, DavidScape. AMG I had 30 people playing something that I was hosting, and it was one of the most fun things I had ever done in my life. I wasn’t very good at RSPS at the time, and I remember one of my greatest achievements was adding a bar where you could click a keg, then get a beer and drink it, then you walk around funny. I was such a noob, it’s funny reading my posts now:</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:1, topic:242403”]Ok, this may seem very noobish, but i am a newb. I dwnloaded a source from Moparscape, then edited some things. When you log in it said "Welcome to *******scape! Owner is… "  I went into client.java, then edited it to say “Welcome to DavidScape! Owner is Davidi2!”   I saved the JAVA file, but when I loaded the client, nothing changed??  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/confusedae52.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:">  how do I make the changes go into effect!?[/quote][quote=“Davidi2, post:3, topic:242403”]Oh lol… i knew that…   also, when ppl start, they are invisible? how do i fix?  It also seems that people cant log in again after logging out. I create an account, log it out, try to log it back in, but it says error connecting to server… fix?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 09, 2008, 11:06:33 am[/size][hr]also, if i close my client(but keep the server running) open it back up, try to log in, it says that the account it already logged in?! <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/confusedae52.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>AM I like, followed by a ghost?? :|[/quote]<br>
A few weeks/months later (it’s all jumbled together) I figured out that you could download different versions of RuneScape. I wanted the best one, so I downloaded a 508 source made by Bulby. (and what a mistake that was, Bulby turns out to be the worse base ever) I ran my 317 server at the same time so people could transfer over, and most people liked the new source. So I learned and studied and got better at what I did. Now I am known as one of the best 508 programmars in teh world! While RSPS is still fun, I wanted to learn more about the language. So I downloaded eBooks and read online tutorials, until I could start making my own programs with Java that printed more than ‘Hello World!’ in a console. Now my school district has recognized my work and is letting me be the first Sophomore to take AP Computer Science in my state in over 25 years. My other neighbor works for the CIS (Computer Information Systems) department at SPU (Seattle Pacific University) also knows about what I do, and I have a Summer  job as an ‘intern equivalent’ (40 hours a week) working for him.</p>

        <p>I started playing RS in 02, but I was playing other MMO’S so I didn’t play much. In 04 I started playing because the game I played shut down. I got into the whole cheating scene at kaitnieks, that shut down and I went to sythe, got banned there for “allegedly” scamming a party hat(Found proof I didn’t and got unbanned). Came here and became a cm, vet, and mod then I got banned because I posted a link to a clan site in which the owner used to phish accounts, and I got banned for not even stealing accounts. Unbanned a year later and they wont even let me have my IRC legend back. Corrupted and elitist staff at it’s finest.</p>

        <p>looked up rs videos on youtube, saw people saying shit like OH THATS MOPAR. i then googled it and found out what the hell it was. i registered in 2007 and found out about a server called frugooscape. it was the best server i ever played, until it shut down.</p>
<p>i then looked for another server, but didnt find any as dedicated as frugooscape. so i came back to moparscape forums in 2008 to learn how to make one of my own. after i followed a guide called “how to port forward for idiots” i then downloaded a souce called D D S P 3 C, edited it, and hosted it. i then attacked by agfbot and then closed my server.</p>
<p>then bla bla bla, got moderated here, people started to know who i was, then i started posting about penis.</p>
