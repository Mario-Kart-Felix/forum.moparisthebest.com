    <description>Just post about how you got into runescape, what you enjoyed about it, what your doing now, and how you came to play mopar.

Heres mine:

The first time I logged on to runescape was 2001. The start of runescape one. (commonly referenced to as runescape classic). On this, I began making my account, which i still have access to classic to on now and i ran around, killing chickens.

I then went on to stand in the wild, lost all my stuff and emoquit for all but 5 minutes. Afterwhich I returned to the wilderness and run up to the dreaded black knights castle. I saw someone PK&#39;ing with a rune 2hander, and while they were fighting i attacked them also (as you could on classic) with my wooden longbow, hitting the final hit (that was a one) on them.

I shit myself irl cause they dropped a rune 2 hander, it remains the greatest day of my life.

I the continued to play on runescape (especially the wilderness) for 4 or 3 years (dont know the exact number) until the wilderness was removed. I had been loving runescape until this happened, with my pure ranger that i trained so often owning everyone in sight.

After this, i FML&#39;ed and went around searching for rsps, where i found (this was about 3 years ago) a server named finalbarrage. I loved it ala max, and played it until the owner eventually quit it.

I then went on to make my own private server (after much messing around with my brothers) called demise pking. This grew spontanously and i eventually ended up with around 80 players, but then i got bored and quit.

After i quit and posted my server on the moparscape forum, i slowly began to become a well known figure there as constant tutorials and snippets were posted by me that noobs loved to the maximum.

Im now famous on mopar and anyone thats been on there and sees me asks me if &quot;im the real demise&quot; rofl.

After this, i began to miss my old demise pking server, and started up edgeville pking with a dude a met called rene. We got 200 players with me successfully coding both server and client with him paying for vps, when we reached 200 he backstabbed me and blocked me from the vps.

I was pretty pissed so i hacked his vps and took the source and released it, making me even more well known on mopar.

I then came to code for massacred world (the first one) which i loved greatly and played often. This continued until it shut down.

I didnt do much while it was down, apart from make new servers and release them further increasing my notoriety on moparscape forums..

Then someone messaged me that this had returned, with the clear amount of PK&#39;ing skill and java coding skill, i came here as a coder. I have made many updates since, and im loving it.

ty for reading, demise.
PS: Ignore the ego thats a problem i have</description>

              <p>looked up rs videos on youtube, saw people saying shit like OH THATS MOPAR. i then googled it and found out what the hell it was. i registered in 2007 and found out about a server called frugooscape. it was the best server i ever played, until it shut down.</p>
<p>i then looked for another server, but didnt find any as dedicated as frugooscape. so i came back to moparscape forums in 2008 to learn how to make one of my own. after i followed a guide called “how to port forward for idiots” i then downloaded a souce called D D S P 3 C, edited it, and hosted it. i then attacked by agfbot and then closed my server.</p>
<p>then bla bla bla, got moderated here, people started to know who i was, then i started posting about penis.</p>

my friend told me about it<br>
[/quote]damn, that took forever to read.<br>
[/quote]Ok, in that case, short story long:</p>
<p>It was about two years ago. My neighbor friend (who had never before cheated on RuneScape) stumbled on the MoparScape client link while search for fast ways to make money on runescape. He called me and started telling me about this place where you could play by yourself and have whatever items you wanted. Neither of us had any idea what this was, but I went over to check it out. I already had a few years programming experience (even though it wasn’t in Java) and was intrigued. Back at home I was learning more and more about Java and RSPS by surfing these forums, and I finally download and started my own 317 server, DavidScape. AMG I had 30 people playing something that I was hosting, and it was one of the most fun things I had ever done in my life. I wasn’t very good at RSPS at the time, and I remember one of my greatest achievements was adding a bar where you could click a keg, then get a beer and drink it, then you walk around funny. I was such a noob, it’s funny reading my posts now:</p>

<p>Ok, this may seem very noobish, but i am a newb. I dwnloaded a source from Moparscape, then edited some things. When you log in it said "Welcome to *******scape!

Owner is Davidi2!”   I saved the JAVA file, but when I loaded the client, nothing changed??  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:">  how do I make the changes go into effect!?<br>

<p>A few weeks/months later (it’s all jumbled together) I figured out that you could download different versions of RuneScape. I wanted the best one, so I downloaded a 508 source made by Bulby. (and what a mistake that was, Bulby turns out to be the worse base ever) I ran my 317 server at the same time so people could transfer over, and most people liked the new source. So I learned and studied and got better at what I did. Now I am known as one of the best 508 programmars in teh world! While RSPS is still fun, I wanted to learn more about the language.

<p>It was about two years ago. My neighbor friend (who had never before cheated on RuneScape) stumbled on the MoparScape client link while search for fast ways to make money on runescape. He called me and started telling me about this place where you could play by yourself and have whatever items you wanted. Neither of us had any idea what this was, but I went over to check it out. I already had a few years programming experience (even though it wasn’t in Java) and was intrigued. Back at home I was learning more and more about Java and RSPS by surfing these forums, and I finally download and started my own 317 server, DavidScape. AMG I had 30 people playing something that I was hosting, and it was one of the most fun things I had ever done in my life. I wasn’t very good at RSPS at the time, and I remember one of my greatest achievements was adding a bar where you could click a keg, then get a beer and drink it, then you walk around funny. I was such a noob, it’s funny reading my posts now:</p>

<p>A few weeks/months later (it’s all jumbled together) I figured out that you could download different versions of RuneScape. I wanted the best one, so I downloaded a 508 source made by Bulby. (and what a mistake that was, Bulby turns out to be the worse base ever) I ran my 317 server at the same time so people could transfer over, and most people liked the new source. So I learned and studied and got better at what I did. Now I am known as one of the best 508 programmars in teh world! While RSPS is still fun, I wanted to learn more about the language. So I downloaded eBooks and read online tutorials, until I could start making my own programs with Java that printed more than ‘Hello World!’ in a console. Now my school district has recognized my work and is letting me be the first Sophomore to take AP Computer Science in my state in over 25 years.

I played this server during spring break 2009, had no mems on rs, was completely bored, so thought I would try a private server, youtubed a video and found this server called “PkScape” played it for a week, then dragon claws got released, I bought them for 999m(max cash back then) and found out about duping and thought it was okay, was iped and I wanted to make a replica of pkscape and have a better server.</p>

              <p>Thats pretty sweet. I played FinalBarrage too. anyways, ima post my story here… hope ya’s enjoy it.</p>
<p>Well i learned rs from a mate in about 2004, (i was 9 at the time) so i played it for abit, thinking it was pretty cool. i had about 20k and i was proud of myself, but then someone came up to me with a phat in about 2008. I was psyched! i went on youtube and was looking at videos for over a half an hour on “How to get a free Party Hat on rs” After i was about to give up, i saw a video that i believed was so true. so i tried it, and i was disapointed when it didnt work. i quickly went back to the video and was about to leave a comment when i saw “FUCKING MOPARSCAPE!” i though… “Whats a moparscape??” so i googled it… and came here. i first started a server named SilabGarza. then i moved onto FinalBarrage. once it got shit down i felt like crying… i went to my old friend from SilabGarza and asked him to teach me how to code. Today, im a decent coder, dont have much rep and people dont know about me but hopefully some stuff is coming soon. Im soon coming out with DarkHeavenz if anyone is interested, add my msn, its in my signature. thanks for reading.</p>
