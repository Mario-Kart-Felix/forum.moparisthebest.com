    <title>How do you do it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-do-it/191927</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t log into rs using a client, or deoB (whatever it is); I have a fairly good understanding of java and want to try editing some just, I realize i&#39;ll get banned. but I can&#39;t get it to work at all... I have what i think should log me in, and everything works fine but when it&#39;s loading it will say 

Requesting Title screen
 then
Connection error retrying in ...

and never finishes meanwhile the Ms-Dos window says,

C:\deobs\317&gt;JAVA -Xmx500m client 0 0 highmem  members 0
Rs2 userclient realese #317


I don&#39;t have the slightest idea whats wrong, Sorry if i&#39;m not being specific enough with names, but in short...
When i click to run the client it opens up a window that shows the RS loading screen, but when it gets to Requesting title screen everything stops working, 

Any help is apreciated :)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 22, 2008, 05:34:47 PM[/size][hr]To be more specific the clirnt/deoB I&#39;m using to load Rs is Moparisthebest&#39;s
RuneScape_317_PRIV.jar

and my Run Clients code is,
ver
JAVA  -Xmx500m client 0 0 highmem members 0
pause

If that helps at all</description>

              <p>Get a current deob, use Popcorn’s deobber or something similar. Fix it so that it compiles ( replacing  with int [], and possibly commenting out some lines ). Change the IP to connect to (find 127.0.0.1 and change it to some RS server URL, their names change, ATM you could use, for example, <a href="http://ch3.runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">ch3.runescape.com</a>). And then it should work.</p>
<p>Make sure that you delete your random.dat in your C:/Windows/.jagex_files_32 folder (or whatever the folder name is) before using and after using the deob, and obivously don’t log in to your main through a deob.</p>
