    <title>Weed better for you then Alcohol or a Cig?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weed-better-for-you-then-alcohol-or-a-cig/275991</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve been debating this at school.

I would like for some &#39;information&#39; about which is worse, and the website you got the details from.

I personally think, if you grow your own weed, it would prob be better for you then alcohol because it dosen&#39;t have any added chemical such as angel dust.</description>

<p>What?</p>
<p>Cigarettes and alcohol are physically addictive. Statistically speaking, cigarettes are more addictive than heroin. Alcohol addiction is also very intense, you can die from the withdrawels.</p>

<p>And it is.</p>
<p>To clarify, I assume when you say healthy you aren’t including overdose (which is easily avoidable assuming you know the potency of your product and aren’t a raging addict) or “potential to destroy your life” which is a pretty abstract thing (and dying destroys your life anyway, so)</p>

              <p>I’m a pretty heavy drinker myself at times, when compared to what’s considered ‘safe’.<br>
I believe alcohol receives less criticism due to the liver’s ability to heal itself. The lungs, by comparison, are completely incapable of self-restoration, making the damage caused by smoking anything that much worse.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, none of these options are completely risk-free. However the liver can, and will, mend itself, making alcohol less potent over a large period of use (this is my opinion and understanding at least).</p>
<p>When comparing both cigarettes and the smoking of weed, I would say that weed is the healthier of the two. I’m a non-smoker, but I believe something that grows in the dirt would have to be better for you than something artificially made like cigarettes.</p>

              <p>[quote=“grantbm, post:23, topic:275991”]I think that weed is much better for you because it grows out of the ground and then you smoke it, but with cigs the tobacco is grown, refined and then additives are added (such as rat poison [wtf]).</p>
<p>I don’t really drink to much so I do not know too much about alcohol.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not just that though, THC, the shit that’s in weed doesn’t harm your body at all, it’s like 1 in 1000 to get paranoid or a mental condition from smoking pot but statistics like that are bullshit cause it’s something like 1 in 1000 people that have a mental condition or are paranoid so really it’s just bullshit that anti-pot activists spread.</p>
<p>Pretty much the negative effects of weed are incredibly small whilst negative effects of alcohol and cigerettes are obvious and huge.</p>
