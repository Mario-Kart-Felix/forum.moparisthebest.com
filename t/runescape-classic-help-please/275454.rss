    <title>Runescape Classic Help Please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-classic-help-please/275454</link>
    <description>Hello,

I would like to start my own private runescape classic server. If there is such a source that is similar or, the same exact source as jagex had for there member world, I would be greatly pleased. Webpage client code would be nice as well. No bugs or any of that bullshit if you can help it. All working fuctions :) Not to copy or anything but if you would just take a look at RSCAngel I would like to set a server up similar to it. Just need to see what to work with, I plan on editing the server source a little. Please post :cool:</description>
