    <description>I have been working on 508&#39;s for a long time and decided to work on something more customizable!

I am using the InsanityX Source and Client I believe, i have been changing the interfaces into the new ones for runescape, I am using the new sidebar icons cause they loom really epic, and just realized the size difference I am not that good with Project Insanity yet and was wondering on how to change the location of the icons

Any help is extremely appreciated!



~Thanks
