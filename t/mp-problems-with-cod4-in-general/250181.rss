    <title>[MP] Problems with COD4 in general</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mp-problems-with-cod4-in-general/250181</link>
    <description>Well, I know the game has been out for a while and everyone&#39;s had a good play with it(probably with COD5 too) but I still see people saying it&#39;s a good FPS, I personally don&#39;t think so. I play the console version, which removes most of the &quot;serious&quot; competition you get on PC FPS games, but brings in hundreds of petty bugs.

Here&#39;s just some of the problems with the game, most of them you&#39;d notice after playing 2-3 games.

Balance issues

[ul][li]LMGs own EVERYTHING, you can shoot them through 2 fucking walls and still kill someone[/li]
[li]SMGs are generally &gt; assault rifles, even at medium to long range[/li]
[li]Firing from the hip &gt; firing from ironsights(somewhat expectable but it&#39;s damned annoying)[/li][/ul]


[ul][li]Grenades take way too long before exploding[/li]
[li]If you use the &quot;Last Stand&quot; perk, you don&#39;t always go into last stand mode(which is good), yet if you use &quot;Martyrdom&quot;, you [b]ALWAYS[/b] drop a live grenade even if you&#39;ve been shot in the head[/li]
[li]Leg shots kill you, rather than make you fall over(ok, ok, I suppose you wouldn&#39;t survive a few shots in the leg, but there&#39;s no reason to not put you into the last stand mode if you don&#39;t have the perk)
[/li][li]Some maps have very unbalanced starting locations[/li][/ul]


General issues

[ul][li]Spawn locations are pretty fucked, I&#39;ve spawned within grenade blast radius of an enemy more times than I care to recall(also, lets not forget, you always seem to spawn at the end of the map if you have a short range weapon, yet spawn right in the action if you have a sniper rifle)[/li]
[li]Airstrikes often come in the wrong way[/li]
[li]Helicopters on some maps(broadcast, bloc) rarely get kills, and on other maps(chinatown) are very hard to destroy[/li]
[li]Games are too short(on team dm, time limit is 10 mins or until a team gets 75 kills)[/li]
[li]Lack of search games by map feature(possibly just for consoles, as I&#39;d imagine on the PC version you&#39;d have a server list)[/li]
[li]After leaving a game(for whatever reason), if you decide to play the same playlist again, there&#39;s a very high chance you&#39;ll be put back in the same game, even if it&#39;s ended(possibly just for consoles, as I&#39;d imagine on the PC version you&#39;d have a server list)
[/li][li]It&#39;s not uncommon to be put in games you can&#39;t play(you know, being put in a search and destroy game with scores at 3-3, being put in a game as it&#39;s ending etc etc)
[/li][li]Player positions often get unsynced, killcam shows this quite well[/li]
[li]Complete lack of gun customization. In the single player campaign(where you storm the village) you get a silenced sniper rifle with proper camouflage, in multiplayer however, the only gun camouflage is paint, and you only get 1 customization on guns(silencer, red dot sight, acog scope etc)[/li][/ul]


You might have been expecting me to moan about some specific guns being ridiculously powerful, but it makes COD4 fun. It&#39;s just a shame the &quot;hardcore&quot; mode is a complete fucking joke. Hardcore should be having to watch your every corner being careful who you shoot at, not carefully getting 3 kills then going back to spraying anything that moves in the same direction the enemy is on the map.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Well I’ve had a chance to play COD5, and after only playing 12 hours of so on MP I’ve seen 2 people using glitches(shooting from <span class="bbcode-b">under</span> the ground), and it’s crashed twice. Apart from that, it’s improved since COD4 but there are still some serious gun issues.</p>
<p>I’ve had my fun with SMGS in COD5, and with an MP40 it takes about 4 hits to kill someone. What this means is, even if you can’t aim for the life of you, you can still kill people. What makes it worse is, the time I spent using it(casually aiming at upper torso or sometimes lower torso when I’m crouching), I seemed to get more headshots randomly shooting without using the ironsights, than I did aiming at their head. This is the same with other guns I used(apart from semi-automatic rifles), and is also the same on COD4. The thing annoying with this is, people are rewarded for not having to aim, because spraying an area is just as effective as taking your time to aim and shoot. I’ve been using the semi-automatic rifles the last few games, and while it only takes 2 shots to kill someone with the gewehr, I find myself shooting 5-6 shots at someone before they die(aiming at them the whole time, looking down the ironsight), and when 2 or more peope are coming towards me, I’ll probably die before killing one. With SMGS though, you can <span class="bbcode-b">easily</span> kill 4+ people coming towards without looking down the ironsight because it only takes around 4 shots to kill someone. If the damage of most guns reduced(excluding bolt-action rifles), and the damage of fully automatic rifles was reduced again, it wouldn’t be so bad. 8-9+ shots to kill someone with an automatic rifle, and 3-4+ to kill someone with a semi-automatic rifle seems reasonable considering reloading times and clip sizes. The problem with that though, is people bad at aiming will do very badly in games, and the level system doesn’t reflect skill, so I don’t see it ever being implemented in a patch(not that it would anyway). The thing that’s annoyed me most is, martyrdom in COD4 is level 17(if I recall correctly), in COD5 it’s level 22. Iron lungs in COD4 was around level 26, in COD5, it is <span class="bbcode-b">60</span>. Many of the “good” perks were upped to massive levels, while martyrdom goes up 3.</p>
<p>Overall though, as I said, it’s an improvement to COD4(I find games rarely end because the host is crap, the single player music was a lot better, and the maps are somewhat better), but it could do with 10-20 more maps, more variety in guns, and a better use for crouch/prone modes(at the minute, crouch only helps with Arisaka sway and prone just makes it hard for someone to shoot you) before I’d say it’s a reasonable game to play. It is a good game, it’s just very repetitive.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, it’s very hard to get enough people to play the nazi-zombie mode, and if you don’t have a lot of friends with COD4 on the same console as you, then gl trying to play it.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Also, overkill is now level 56 now, from 38.</p>

I’ll be getting it soon, mostly for the single player campaign(and possibly co-op).<br>

The cod 5 weapons are very very well balanced. If you have a HMG and you catch a group of people by surprise, you will win. If its one on one, and someone with a smg sees you, they will win due to less recoil and more accuracy.[/quote]</p>
<p>Just like LMG’s in COD4…</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I thought I’d have a few games on COD4, 3 “game ends” less than 200 score in, join 4 games that are nearly finished or at the scores bit and had 2 good maps voted to vacant. Didn’t even have 1 good game.</p>

              <p>Yeah, CoD4 is a decent game - a bit of fun messing around with friends, but when you’re playing it by yourself properly, you notice these things and just ruins the game totally.</p>
<p>CoD: WaW has its fair share of problems but i think the guns are generally much more balanced than the ones on CoD4, the main reasons why i think CoD: WaW is better than CoD4 is the story mode is much more realistic, feels much more like a war, the 4 player co-op and the zombie mode.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Well, I know the game has been out for a while and everyone’s had a good play with it(probably with COD5 too) but I still see people saying it’s a good FPS, I personally don’t think so. I play the console version, which removes most of the “serious” competition you get on PC FPS games, but brings in hundreds of petty bugs.</p>
<p>Here’s just some of the problems with the game, most of them you’d notice after playing 2-3 games.</p>
<p>Balance issues</p>
<p>[ul][li]LMGs own EVERYTHING, you can shoot them through 2 fucking walls and still kill someone[/li]<br>
[li]SMGs are generally &gt; assault rifles, even at medium to long range[/li]<br>
[li]Firing from the hip &gt; firing from ironsights(somewhat expectable but it’s damned annoying)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[ul][li]Grenades take way too long before exploding[/li]<br>
[li]If you use the “Last Stand” perk, you don’t always go into last stand mode(which is good), yet if you use “Martyrdom”, you <span class="bbcode-b">ALWAYS</span> drop a live grenade even if you’ve been shot in the head[/li]<br>
[li]Leg shots kill you, rather than make you fall over(ok, ok, I suppose you wouldn’t survive a few shots in the leg, but there’s no reason to not put you into the last stand mode if you don’t have the perk)<br>
[/li][li]Some maps have very unbalanced starting locations[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>General issues</p>
<p>[ul][li]Spawn locations are pretty fucked, I’ve spawned within grenade blast radius of an enemy more times than I care to recall(also, lets not forget, you always seem to spawn at the end of the map if you have a short range weapon, yet spawn right in the action if you have a sniper rifle)[/li]<br>
[li]Airstrikes often come in the wrong way[/li]<br>
[li]Helicopters on some maps(broadcast, bloc) rarely get kills, and on other maps(chinatown) are very hard to destroy[/li]<br>
[li]Games are too short(on team dm, time limit is 10 mins or until a team gets 75 kills)[/li]<br>
[li]Lack of search games by map feature(possibly just for consoles, as I’d imagine on the PC version you’d have a server list)[/li]<br>
[li]After leaving a game(for whatever reason), if you decide to play the same playlist again, there’s a very high chance you’ll be put back in the same game, even if it’s ended(possibly just for consoles, as I’d imagine on the PC version you’d have a server list)<br>
[/li][li]It’s not uncommon to be put in games you can’t play(you know, being put in a search and destroy game with scores at 3-3, being put in a game as it’s ending etc etc)<br>
[/li][li]Player positions often get unsynced, killcam shows this quite well[/li]<br>
[li]Complete lack of gun customization. In the single player campaign(where you storm the village) you get a silenced sniper rifle with proper camouflage, in multiplayer however, the only gun camouflage is paint, and you only get 1 customization on guns(silencer, red dot sight, acog scope etc)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>You might have been expecting me to moan about some specific guns being ridiculously powerful, but it makes COD4 fun. It’s just a shame the “hardcore” mode is a complete fucking joke. Hardcore should be having to watch your every corner being careful who you shoot at, not carefully getting 3 kills then going back to spraying anything that moves in the same direction the enemy is on the map.</p>
