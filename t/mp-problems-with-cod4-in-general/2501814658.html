        <p>Well I’ve had a chance to play COD5, and after only playing 12 hours of so on MP I’ve seen 2 people using glitches(shooting from <span class="bbcode-b">under</span> the ground), and it’s crashed twice. Apart from that, it’s improved since COD4 but there are still some serious gun issues.</p>
<p>I’ve had my fun with SMGS in COD5, and with an MP40 it takes about 4 hits to kill someone. What this means is, even if you can’t aim for the life of you, you can still kill people. What makes it worse is, the time I spent using it(casually aiming at upper torso or sometimes lower torso when I’m crouching), I seemed to get more headshots randomly shooting without using the ironsights, than I did aiming at their head. This is the same with other guns I used(apart from semi-automatic rifles), and is also the same on COD4. The thing annoying with this is, people are rewarded for not having to aim, because spraying an area is just as effective as taking your time to aim and shoot. I’ve been using the semi-automatic rifles the last few games, and while it only takes 2 shots to kill someone with the gewehr, I find myself shooting 5-6 shots at someone before they die(aiming at them the whole time, looking down the ironsight), and when 2 or more peope are coming towards me, I’ll probably die before killing one. With SMGS though, you can <span class="bbcode-b">easily</span> kill 4+ people coming towards without looking down the ironsight because it only takes around 4 shots to kill someone. If the damage of most guns reduced(excluding bolt-action rifles), and the damage of fully automatic rifles was reduced again, it wouldn’t be so bad. 8-9+ shots to kill someone with an automatic rifle, and 3-4+ to kill someone with a semi-automatic rifle seems reasonable considering reloading times and clip sizes. The problem with that though, is people bad at aiming will do very badly in games, and the level system doesn’t reflect skill, so I don’t see it ever being implemented in a patch(not that it would anyway). The thing that’s annoyed me most is, martyrdom in COD4 is level 17(if I recall correctly), in COD5 it’s level 22. Iron lungs in COD4 was around level 26, in COD5, it is <span class="bbcode-b">60</span>. Many of the “good” perks were upped to massive levels, while martyrdom goes up 3.</p>
<p>Overall though, as I said, it’s an improvement to COD4(I find games rarely end because the host is crap, the single player music was a lot better, and the maps are somewhat better), but it could do with 10-20 more maps, more variety in guns, and a better use for crouch/prone modes(at the minute, crouch only helps with Arisaka sway and prone just makes it hard for someone to shoot you) before I’d say it’s a reasonable game to play. It is a good game, it’s just very repetitive.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, it’s very hard to get enough people to play the nazi-zombie mode, and if you don’t have a lot of friends with COD4 on the same console as you, then gl trying to play it.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Also, overkill is now level 56 now, from 38.</p>
