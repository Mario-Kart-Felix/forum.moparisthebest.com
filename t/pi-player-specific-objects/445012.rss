    <description>Alright I am trying to add farming to my source, but I have come to the the problem that if somone were to rake the weeds, it would rake for other players aswell, aswell as when they plant it. If somone could help me by giving me something, or pointing me in the right direction, so that only the person that planted the plant can see it.

Thanks in advance.</description>

<p>Farming uses configs, in PI to send configs you use either sendFrame36 or sendFrame87, depending on the amount of bytes.</p>
<p>But, if you really want to suck ass and do it the wrong way I suggest using this constructor</p>
<p><code>public Objects(final int id, final int x, final int y, final int height,
			final int face, final int type, final int ticks, String owner) {
		objectId = id;
		objectX = x;
		objectY = y;
		objectHeight = height;
		objectFace = face;
		objectType = type;
		objectTicks = ticks;
		this.owner = owner;
	}</code>[/quote]</p>
<p>Do you mind explaining what “objectType” and “objectTicks” are?</p>
