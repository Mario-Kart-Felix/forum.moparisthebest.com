    <title>Looking to build computer $1200 USD</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-build-computer-1200-usd/426152</link>
    <description>So I am going to be building another PC here I want to have it done by the 31st. I have 1200 to work with but I already have some stuff picked out.

Case: Corsair Graphite Series 600T $159.99 - $139.99 After Rebate
PSU: CORSAIR Professional Series HX650 $109.99 - $89.99 After Rebate
CPU Cooler: Trusty Old H50? (84.66)?

This leaves $845.36

What I want

I need a fast fucking processor (i7???)
A reliable and feature loaded motherboard that can support all the connectors on the case (ASUS?)
A good amount of reliable and compatible ram for that motherboard (?)
A reliable SSD to hold the main operating system (30-60GB?)
A decent video card (doesnt have to be top notch but should be able to run new games at pretty good settings)
If there is still money left over I am thinking 1TB harddrive?

Let me know what you guys come up with. I am doing my own research but there is so many options for motherboards, ram, video cards and I havent been keeping up recently. I can probably squeeze another $100 dollars in if need be

Update: So definitely Intel Core i7-2600K because it seems like the best core i7 for the price according the benchmarks, but picking out the RAM and a reliable motherboard is the hardpart

OKAY: So heres what I have come up with so far

Still missing SSD and Hard Drive though</description>

<p>you mean 36+ months</p>
<p>and at the end of 36 months they’ll still be fairly decent better than average gaming computers</p>
<p>at the end of 5 years they might show signs of dating but will still be more powerful than most low end boxes made from 2017 and previous</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t know how you figure that at all? I have a Intel Q9450 that I paid about $300 dollars for about 3ish? years ago and it still is a very good processor, better than most you can find unless we start talking core i5’s and i7’s or new AMD Phenom X4’s and higher. And for the core i7 2600k to be only $300 dollars and be at the very top of CPU benchmarks I think it will still be a very good processor in 3-4 years.</p>

<p>Okay whats listed in the wishlist now is what I ordered. I didnt want to get the MSI board cause I was really deadset on the ASUS board (brand loyalty) and I didnt want the OCZ Vertex 3 because the reviews I was reading werent that good but im guessing you have had good experience with them otherwise you wouldnt have recommended it to me. But I did take the GTX 470 even though it was a bit far priced and I did pick a SSD that had good read/write speed. So the final price came out too around ~$1700 USD. I added a bluray bruner also.[/quote]<br>
You forgot HD, and if you went over your budget, how will you get one?</p>

              <p>So I am going to be building another PC here I want to have it done by the 31st. I have 1200 to work with but I already have some stuff picked out.</p>
<p>Case: Corsair Graphite Series 600T $159.99 - $139.99 After Rebate<br>
PSU: CORSAIR Professional Series HX650 $109.99 - $89.99 After Rebate<br>
CPU Cooler: Trusty Old H50? (84.66)?</p>
<p>This leaves $845.36</p>
<p>What I want</p>
<p>I need a fast fucking processor (i7???)<br>
A reliable and feature loaded motherboard that can support all the connectors on the case (ASUS?)<br>
A good amount of reliable and compatible ram for that motherboard (?)<br>
A reliable SSD to hold the main operating system (30-60GB?)<br>
A decent video card (doesnt have to be top notch but should be able to run new games at pretty good settings)<br>
If there is still money left over I am thinking 1TB harddrive?</p>
<p>Let me know what you guys come up with. I am doing my own research but there is so many options for motherboards, ram, video cards and I havent been keeping up recently. I can probably squeeze another $100 dollars in if need be</p>
<p>Update: So definitely Intel Core i7-2600K because it seems like the best core i7 for the price according the benchmarks, but picking out the RAM and a reliable motherboard is the hardpart</p>
<p>OKAY: So heres what I have come up with so far<br>

<p>Still missing SSD and Hard Drive though</p>
