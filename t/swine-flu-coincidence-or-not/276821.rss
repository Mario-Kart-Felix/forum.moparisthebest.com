    <title>Swine Flu-coincidence or not?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/swine-flu-coincidence-or-not/276821</link>
    <description>Well we have all heard of Swine Flu 2012 and what not.
But what if 2012 is already happening?
What if the world will end in 2012 but by the SWINE flu.
It has already killed a few people and a few more years if we can&#39;t find something to stop it it could become something more powerful.

I would like to hear your opinions on this.</description>

It’s not the actual disease itself. It affects people differently, some people are hit very hard by it, others just for reasons unknown don’t suffer nowhere near enough. I posted that when I thought Swine flu was the reason I was sent home from Kapooka, only to find out it was glandular fever.</p>

<p>Actually they spend that money on the military probably.

I did not say it, I just say they can use more money since they take up loans and don’t spend much on health care they had more money for other things, I did not say what they used their money for.</p>

<p>…and look at how many people don’t have health insurance in the USA, or the people that cannot afford medicine due to it being several times more expensive than in other countries.<br>

<p>It’s ridiculously expensive. If I didn’t have a health insurance, I’d have to pay about €5000 just to get to hospital in an ambulance. Not to mention the costs of the rest of my health care. I saw a report on the US, where a family got a bill of about $20.000. If they all live by the ‘keeping up with the Joneses’ system, which most Americans do, they’ll have to get a loan to pay their bill, and increase their monthly pay again.[/quote]</p>
<p>Lol my grandma needed emergency surgery and it was going to cost $700,000 because she lives in Canada (she was in USA at the time), so doesn’t have insurance in USA. So they flew her by helicopter back to Canada, which costed $20,000</p>
