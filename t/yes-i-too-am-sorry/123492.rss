    <title>Yes, I too am sorry</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/yes-i-too-am-sorry/123492</link>
    <description>I too, am sorry for the hormonal changes happening in my body, I cannot control them :( I&#39;m so sorry, but as I said on IRC, I have nothing to be apologetic for I&#39;ve always been seen as Immature by the Moparisthebest community.
&lt;blockquote&gt;I just read MybJames&#39; post, about how I&#39;ve gone from being mature to a whiny bitch.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This too has always been the case for me, I seem to come across whiny, most people by know have closed the tab or clicked on General Discussion :P
If I see fit to have a &quot;argument&quot; with someone, I will.
&lt;blockquote&gt;I don&#39;t enjoy arguing with you all and I sure as hell don&#39;t enjoy being hated by you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Same goes with me, some people obviously hate me :P Doesn&#39;t matter, I try and not bother them often.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The way I see it, the stronger man is always the man who says sorry and moves on. And the weaker man is the person who says &quot;HAHAHA I&#39;m not figiving you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is always not the case with me, I admit, sometimes I&#39;m not at &quot;tough&quot; as I should be, but I&#39;m making efforts.
[quote-Yz85Racer]Until this moment, I&#39;m going to try and be &quot;un-imature&quot;... Because it&#39;s not only on these forums that I have been acting this way.[/quote]
I also act this way on the IRC most of the time.Obvious effect&#39;s are my &quot;Lothy is a Nazi&quot; thread, I think we sorted it out.After recent discussion with Mod_Tonka (You need to make that highlight you) I&#39;ve been making efforts.

So, I guess what I am trying to say is, can I please have another chance and not be an idiot? And that I&#39;m terribably sorry to any body who had to listen to me bitch and moan and all the people that I was an asshole too.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Man, puberties a bitch.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I cannot change a hormonal process. 
Yes, I did take most of these from Yz85Racer, this could be a reply/rebuttal(Spelling right? My spell checker thinks so :S)
So, with that, I&#39;m going to try and change, but I will still have the quality&#39;s you ether hate or love.
That, I cannot change.</description>

              <p>You sound less sincere than Yz85Racer because you basically copied what he said trying to get some popularity back.</p>
<p>EDIT: Not trying to throw your apology back in your face by the way, I’m just saying you don’t sound as sincere as Yz85Racer in my opinion, but that could be due to the fact that you both have made threads saying sorry for acting immaturely. Anyway apology accepted, be good. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
