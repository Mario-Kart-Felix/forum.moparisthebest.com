    <title>Shops open in one room but not another?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shops-open-in-one-room-but-not-another/218357</link>
    <description>Well when you talk to the wise old man the bar shop opens up.  It works in my second training area.  But when you click talk-to wise old man in my first training area it doesnt.  It is like that with every single npc.  Works in 2nd but not 1st.  Both places are non wild and both npcs are 2253.  Anyone know what might be causing this?</description>
