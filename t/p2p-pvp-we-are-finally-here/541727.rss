[center][shadow=red,left]EloSystem Rating[/shadow][/center]
[FONT=Arial Narrow][SIZE=4]&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than his or her opponent&#39;s is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%.
A number represents a player&#39;s Elo rating and increases or decreases based upon the outcome of games between rated players. After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. In a series of games between a high-rated player and a low-rated player, the high-rated player is expected to score more wins. If the high-rated player wins, then only a few rating points will be taken from the low-rated player whereas if the lower rated player scores an upset win, then many rating points will be transferred. The lower rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. The rating system thus is self-correcting. A player whose rating is too low should, in the long run, do better than the rating system predicts and thereby gain rating points until the rating reflects his or her true playing strength.[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;[/CENTER]

<p>Server is absolute shit. There is 2 people in the wild with prings that just kill everyone and every time you login they say to quit. The owner is super inactive. Server should be shut down.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I would just like to point out that items were just released as spawnable. The server is brand new so you can’t really call the owner inactive and you were one of the players using a p ring and flamming players in game. How about you let us fix all the bugs glitches and anything else that needs to be fixed as I have noticed a few major things that need to be done but no servers are perfect after 4 days online so please. Be reasonable about how you comment about servers things will get sorted and you’re ruining our chances of ever having a chance flamming players, telling them to quit and just calling the server complete shit. So we appreciate the feedback but really without flamming you think before you post.</p>
