iPlay 317

Hey, i&#39;m Matt.

About iPlay 317
We are a small group of people, looking for a start. We have been wanting to take off for a while now, after planning too many ideas, we finally are starting up. We have goals, waypoints to meet up to. We have and have always wanted a well player earned server. Skills, runecrafting, smithing, thieving... We want skills like these, skills that generate the economy to be the foundation of our server. Greg and I are completely dedicated on making this server what we have been hoping for. We have spent many hours working on a good format for a website, gathering suggestions, making a to-do list, and more. We are just struggling with getting help, not too easy to do all this alone. If you think you may be able to help, read on.

What we are looking for
We are looking for a few extra developers to join our team. We are creating this from a blank. We aren&#39;t the most experienced with this, so we require a little assistance.
NOTE: It would help incredibly if you had a mic and owned either Skype or Ventrilo.

Whether your somewhat experienced or super experienced, if you think you could make a useful addition to our development team, in any way, send us a message via MSN.

Specifically,
- A Source Developer
- A Client Developer

Lead in Project - Greg_iPlay317@live.com

Application:
Name -
Position -
Age -
Experience -
Mic? -
MSN - (if you have one, if not, post your skype)

If you have any questions before you want to contact us, feel free to ask them here. I would be more than happy to respond![/center]</description>
