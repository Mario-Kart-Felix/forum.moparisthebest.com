              <p>ok well nvm I found the answer and also no its not equivalent to it at all because if you depending on a char token to either move/teleport or do something specific and new players join “a server” and there summoning char token is c.lastsummon = 0 and the people who have dismissed there familiar get c.lastsummon = -1 now you cant add both into a case or it wont work, Neither player will work with that case. So you would have to change the -1 to a 0 so both players can access the case. So technically speaking your reply is completely wrong for what this topic was aiming for.</p>

<p>-1 is equivalent to nothing or what you’re looking for, 0. Like slayerTask = 123 and the resetslayerTask = -1.</p>
