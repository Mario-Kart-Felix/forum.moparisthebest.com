    <title>A debate?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-debate/526982</link>
    <description>Hello Moparscape community,

I&#39;d like to tell a story to everyone, my moparscape advertisement page on http://moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php got deleted, probably because some other leecher took my last years source, didn&#39;t change the name and hosted it straight away. My advertisement had the same name &quot;Vyrescape 745&quot;, the leecher had it &quot;Vyre&#39;. I lost about 2 months of advertisement, which got me nearly to 2&#39;000 votes. I was ranked #4 on the list. Today, I log in, wanted to check out on our progress and saw, that our advertisement got deleted? For what? Why?

So my debate is about this: Is that normal that &quot;Moparisthebest&quot; is only seeking money? People work hard for this, yet he only cares about the dough? He hasn&#39;t even updated the status page list since he released that Beta? It still says this

The year 2012. It&#39;ll soon be 2014 Mopar ;).


EDIT: You should check the IP&#39;s before doing that, you&#39;d clearly see that I&#39;m on the forums from my legit IP address. And registered the server from my VPS.

Maybe it&#39;s not your fault Mopar, maybe it&#39;s the status pages fault, because it is in Beta still. But I highly doubt that it only affected my advertisement just like that randomly.</description>
