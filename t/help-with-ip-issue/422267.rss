    <title>Help with ip issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-ip-issue/422267</link>
    <description>I recently upgraded my internet speed and it changed my static ip address to a dhcp ip and for some reason I can&#39;t host at my house anymore. But as soon as I go to someone else&#39;s house, it works like a charm. Any help here?</description>
