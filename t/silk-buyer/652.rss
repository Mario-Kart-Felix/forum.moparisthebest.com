    <title>Silk Buyer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/silk-buyer/652</link>
    <description>Hello,

     Thanks for opening up this thread, atleast my post views are going up  :). This isn&#39;t a very hard request at all. Yet after trying to do it with SCAR, couldn&#39;t do it, then taking my chances with Aryan, couldn&#39;t do it. I&#39;ve decided to maybe ask for some help. As some people know silk in RuneScape is very profitable. You can buy from the silk seller in Alkharid then transfer on your main and sell in Ardougne for a 57 gp profit. Heres some figures.

Silk buy price: 3gp
Buy 27 Silk from Alkharid Silk Seller: 81 gp
Silk sell price: 60
Sell 27 silk to Ardougne Silk Merchant: 1620gp
Profit: 1539

So as you can see just one load of this smooth gold is making you a 1.5k profit, good right, WRONG. It takes a series of 17 clicks per silk, thats 459 clicks per load and a lot more than I wish to do. So why not make an auto for it. It wouldn&#39;t be that hard to sell it on your own with a member account if you have one. It is only about 5 clicks per load to sell. So please consider making this script just for the awesome profit you can make and give back to the community, I have tried many times to script this and I am still trying. I thought the least I could do was bring up the idea. All you need is about 15k, make 57 times that  :D. If you cannot script then please at least give me your thoughts on this. Constructive critisim is appreciated.


                                                             Thank You,

              <p>It’s a good idea, I’ll look into this though I hardly know enough scripting to actually make a working one. I’ll put it on my to-do list <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
