    <title>Creating a Webclient with a cache that needs to be downloaded</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-webclient-with-a-cache-that-needs-to-be-downloaded/376931</link>
    <description>I use rs-ps for creating a webclient, but the server I&#39;m using has a cache that needs to be downloaded before you can play the server.
Is there any way to make it so it&#39;s downloaded automatically?</description>
