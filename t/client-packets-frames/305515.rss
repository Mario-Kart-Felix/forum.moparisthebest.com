    <title>Client packets(frames)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-packets-frames/305515</link>
    <description>Hello, I am trying to conduct a small experiment with client-server communications. I want to send packet 26 with some extra information(like an int or a byte or something like that) to the server, but whenever I do, it reads that it&#39;s packet 26, but the rest is not correct. This is what I get:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[08:56:06]Received Packet 26: 16128//This 16128 is what is returned when the server&#39;s stream.readInt() is called for the client written int 26.
[08:56:06]Unhandled packet: packetID=175
[08:56:06]Unhandled packet: packetID=150
[08:56:08]Unhandled packet: packetID=218
[08:56:08]Unhandled packet: packetID=110
[08:56:09]Unhandled packet: packetID=110
[08:56:10]Unhandled packet: packetID=27
[08:56:14]Unhandled packet: packetID=129
[08:56:14]Unhandled packet: packetID=27
[08:56:18]Unhandled packet: packetID=16
[08:56:23]Unhandled packet: packetID=236
[08:56:29]Unhandled packet: packetID=162
[08:56:31]Unhandled packet: packetID=53
[08:56:32]Unhandled packet: packetID=108
[08:56:33]Unhandled packet: packetID=60
[08:56:34]Unhandled packet: packetID=110
[08:56:35]Unhandled packet: packetID=163&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#39;s a fairly bare server(basically login and walking) so I don&#39;t have any of the other packets documented right now, but I was wondering if I was doing something wrong, or was missing something.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 01, 2009, 03:12:13 pm[/size][hr]Can anyone help me with this?</description>
