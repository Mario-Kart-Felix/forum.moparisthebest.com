    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-points-help-please/378705</link>
    <description>ok so first of all i get 1 pkp point per death im trying to make it 10 or so but my problem is i cant find where to change it
the only variable i can find for pk points is this
[code=java]if(c.duelStatus != 6) {
			//c.killerId = c.getCombat().getKillerId(c.playerId);
			c.killerId = findKiller();
			Client o = (Client) Server.playerHandler.players[c.killerId];
			if(o != null) {
				if(!(c.npcIndex &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; c.inPits == false){
				}
				if (c.killerId != c.playerId)
					o.sendMessage(&quot;You have defeated &quot;+Misc.optimizeText(c.playerName)+&quot;!&quot;);
					c.playerKilled = c.playerId;
				if(!PlayerKilling.hostOnList(o, c.connectedFrom)) {
					PlayerKilling.addHostToList(o, c.connectedFrom);
					o.pkPoints++;
					o.sendMessage(&quot;You have received a point, you now have &quot;+o.pkPoints+&quot; pk points.&quot;);
					} else {
					o.sendMessage(&quot;You have recently defeated &quot;+c.playerName+&quot;, you don&#39;t receive any pk points.&quot;);
					}
				if(o.duelStatus == 5) {
					o.duelStatus++;
				}
			}
		}[/code]
and its just pkpoints++ there is no number to change
