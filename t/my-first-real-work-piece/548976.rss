    <title>My First Real Work Piece</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-first-real-work-piece/548976</link>
    <description>I have made a few previous works but they were pretty bad. I have decided to make my name twice, one based on the tutorial that BasiX made, then the other off my own knowledge I would like to know what you guys think.

First piece, (based off of BasiX tutorial)
