    <description>[center][center]We Need to Ban ALL Guns After The Recent Massacre[/center]
Hahah, yeah right. Me, wanting guns banned? Hilarious. You want to know why I think gun control is hilarious and possibly the worst idea when trying to stop crime? Because the right to bear arms is for protection against the wack jobs out in the world. With the prohibition of guns we would see more cartels popping up with a brand new product line to sell. Not only that, but, imagine a world without guns. You want to rob someone&#39;s house or a convenient store? No problem. What&#39;s the worry? It&#39;s not like anyone in there is going to stop you with just their fists. All you have to worry about is getting out of there before the cops come. 

Why was this thread created? 2 reasons. One obviously because of the Colorado shooting incident and everyone saying we need gun bans because of it, when in reality if multiple people were carrying in that theater there would have been a lot less casualties. And the second reason is because of a video recently uploaded that has gone semi-viral. The video I&#39;m speaking of is below:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjH3ZMUks1o

Now that&#39;s a true American for you.

[i]&quot;Firearms stand next in importance to the constitution itself. They are the American people&#39;s liberty teeth and keystone under independence … from the hour the Pilgrims landed to the present day, events, occurences and tendencies prove that to ensure peace security and happiness, the rifle and pistol are equally indispensable … the very atmosphere of firearms anywhere restrains evil interference — they deserve a place of honor with all that&#39;s good.&quot;[/i]

- George Washington

Damn do I love the good parts of this country.[/center][/center]

              <p>Australia has very strict gun laws. There are of course occasional shootings, but that’s really only in gang operated areas (lower district Melbourne, western Sydney). Last I checked, we don’t have that many massacres (besides Port Arthur, aboriginal massacres, bikey war shootouts [honestly, I don’t give two fucks if a bikey shoots 10 other bikeys… Let them kill one another]). Ofcourse Australia has had murderers, what country hasn’t, but ones involving gun violence are particularly rare, especially since licensing was introduced (and even then, only certain types of guns are allowed, and your reason has to be “farming” or something, self defense is not a valid reason) - as far as I’m aware there hasn’t been a mass shooting (3+ shot) in over 15 years.</p>
<p>Australia differs from our neighbor New Zealand, in that they are allowed to license particular guns banned in Australia - their gun violence, despite having a much smaller population than Australia, is still higher, whereas when we introduced licensing and became extremely strict, our gun violence dropped a lot.</p>
<p>Having said all of that, stabbings are becoming a huge problem in Australia.</p>

              <p>When it comes to gun rights, I believe the issue isn’t self protection from your neighbor, in-fact, i feel pretty safe in my particular neighborhood.</p>
<p>A government attempting to regulate and control an armed society is much more careful not to royally piss them off. 45% of Americans are gun owners, that’s the section of the population you don’t want to piss off too much…</p>
<p>The issue with fertalizer bombs, is you require both fertalizer (which is almost always purchased in bulk by farmers, 50lb minimum), and diesel fuel (which is in the states sold by nature in bulk). Regulating both is impossible, besides, there are other ways to make bombs besides fertilizer and diesel fuel, all of which are impossible to regulate. Some examples:</p>
<p>KNO3 (saltpeter) + C (charcoal) + S (sulfur) = Black powder bomb, all ingredients are easy to obtain in bulk and can be bought at walmart</p>
<p>KNO3 (saltpeter) + Al (aluminum) = Flash Powder Bomb, all ingredients are easy to obtain in bulk and can be bought at walmart</p>
<p>H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) + H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) + (CH3)2CO (acetone) = Acetone Peroxide, all ingredients are easy to obtain in bulk, most can be bought at hobby lobby and walmart.</p>
<p>Explosives are fairly easy to make with a middle school knowledge of chemistry, and note that these are just ones i know off the top of my head… there are a hell of a lot more ways to make things go boom than what i just mentioned. The only reason you don’t see people blowing up buildings all the time is simply because people really don’t want to… Not because of government regulation.</p>
<p>[Also, please don’t attempt to make the acetone peroxide bomb, its very volatile…]</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, most people who actually will go out and attempt a massacre are generally very stupid. And being stupid, they often choose to use guns, and I say thank God for that decision, because if they had used some of the methods I’ve dreamt up, there probably be a hell of a lot more people dead. And when you take those guns away, they’ll be forced to invent their own methods, and that is when i’ll be scared.</p>

From what I’ve heard, it takes months to get cleared for an FFL.  Apparently in some cases the government will actually contact people who know you (I’m assuming former employers, relations like that), and basically ask them if you’re a basket case on top of the normal background check from the FBI.  Now whether that is true or not, idk.  But you have to go through the same process every time you attempt to buy a class 3 weapon.  So I can’t just do it once, and go buy a ton of AR15s.  I would have to get the background check, fill out all the paper work, pay the $200 tax, on each weapon.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
It seems that the ATF also does a face-to-face interview with you.<br>
Oh, and your local law enforcement has to sign off on it saying they allow you to own a class 3 weapon.</p>

To some extent, his argument isn’t terrible.  If I really wanted to kill someone, I could do it with a baseball bat just as easily as I could with a gun.  And yeah, a gun makes it easier for some sort of massacre, but I could just as easily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">make a bomb with materials that are not at all hard to come across, and kill even more than you would with a gun</a>.</p>

<p>And missiles/RPGs and legal assault rifles are two completely different things.  And I’ll be honest, I don’t believe everyone who can afford a weapon should be able to by one.  I’m all for background checks on any weapon you purchase.  (Everything from a bolt action .22 lr, to a semi-auto high caliber rife).  I don’t agree that guns should be outlawed, or limited though.</p>
<p>Most people just see “they can kill people.”  But then theres people (like me) who see a fuckton of family heritage in these guns.  That hunting rifle was my grandfathers.  His guns, his knives, and a few of his tools are what he passed down to me.  Something that was of great value to him, and he knew it’d be of the same, if not more, value to me.  And I can honestly say, if guns ever do become outlawed, they’re going to have a hell of a hard time getting those from me.</p>

What about banning firearms that are perfect for mass murders?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Atm, my brother can go out, buy an AK47 for 500 dollars and let it sit in his house. I don’t see the need for a 19 year old to have an AK47 unless he is fighting in a war.[/quote]<br>
In the US?  What you’re neglecting to say is that it’s not a military grade AK47, but rather a semi-auto rifle.  Unless he buys it illegally, or applies for a Class 3 (federal) firearms stamp… And that has a huge amount of background checks with it.</p>
<p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:84, topic:451525”]What about banning firearms that are perfect for mass murders?<br>
I’m not speaking of banning all guns. If I remember right, all non-tool knives are illegal in Norway. That means that if your knife is primarily a weapon it is illegal. But it doesn’t mean that every knife here is illegal. It will be the same about guns. A RPG, Sniper or an assault rifle serve no defence or peacefully purpose, and therefore should not be in private ownership. FUCK criminals in their arse, having such weapons would not give you a better chance of defending yourself.[/quote]<br>
I could buy spare magazines for a small caliber handgun and have one hell of a mass murder.  Someone who is accurate enough, and fast enough could walk in with a bolt action .22 caliber rifle and do a ton of damage.  And what classifies a gun as a sniper rifle?  I have a .30-06 rifle with a long range scope that I use for hunting…  Are you saying I shouldn’t be allowed to own a rifle to hunt with?  I agree you shouldn’t be allowed to own true military grade weapons, such as RPGs, but even assault rifles can be used in a lot of shooting competitions around the country.</p>

There is no need, but as I said earlier, banning them in the U.S. just won’t happen. To many people love their guns and the right to own them, and government won’t risk the loss of support.<br>

To many people love their automatic guns/rifles?</p>
<p>Please specify what type of weapon you are talking about, since we are not against firearms, just weapons of mass murder.[/quote]Sorry, they love any gun they can legally purchase and own, which does in fact include automatic weapons.</p>

<p>What about banning firearms that are perfect for mass murders?</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Atm, my brother can go out, buy an AK47 for 500 dollars and let it sit in his house. I don’t see the need for a 19 year old to have an AK47 unless he is fighting in a war.<br>

No training or background check?[/quote]<br>
Nope</p>
