<p>Gun-carry permits I am kind of so-so on. Many people who don’t <span class="bbcode-i">need</span> to carry a weapon have one. You shouldn’t even be able to carry one in a smaller city, I believe it would be better to limit it to large cities (where crime is a lot more common). Include some type of testing before you issue the weapon as well. One of my friend’s mom had a .357, but was not carrying, but eventually it ended up getting stolen by a kid and eventually thrown away. People who do not understand gun safety and storage should not have a gun, period.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t anyone ever commit a serious crime using a bow? (Actually, an 8 year old girl was recently shot by a bow from around here. Ridiculous).</p>

<p>kid_tom: How do you make your own accurate safe gun/firearm?</p>

</aside>
<p>Despite kid_tom talking out of his ass, if you remove the word safe, you probably could. It’s not like the functionality of a firearm is complex. Acquiring the parts might be hard. Even if guns were banned, it’s not like guns/parts are going to be non-existent. They would be traded silently just like marijuana or any other illegal object.</p>

        <p>Does anyone really picture a futuristic society where civilians still carry guns (or their future equivalent)?</p>
<p>Immediate bans need to be made on all guns that aren’t immediately useful in civilian life. Their is no need for automatic weaponry, huge stockpiles of ammunition, or entire personal arsenals in any pro-gun argument.</p>
<p>International regulation on the production, transport and sale of guns (jesus do you know how many ak-47’s there are?) to limit the exponential increase of firearms and all of their negative effects (African warlords, inhumane government regimes, smuggling to name a few).</p>
<p>Long term solutions need to be found. It follows the basis of nuclear disarmament either we destroy it or somebody will be stupid enough or insane enough to let it destroy us (guns won’t destroy us but they will kill MANY innocent people). Honestly as soon as effective and safe stun guns are invented only military entities (not police etc) will have use for shoot-to-kill weapons, and that is only because their enemies will have them.</p>
<p>Finally to debunk the argument that it is supposed to protect us from the U.S. government… if we truly had weapons to equal our government (fighter jets, helicopters, tanks) we would be in a permanent state of mob-rule, not the democratic-republic that we are today.</p>

        <p><span class="bbcode-b">Chassy13</span>: It is true, you would still guns available. The only difference is how far people want to go to get a gun. The Oslo terrorist last year got his firearms legally, it took him 6 months. So gun control is no argument when it comes to more planned acts. What you avoid is people randomly finds out that he want a gun and abuse it. I might have mentioned it a couple of times before, but guns in the hands of criminals isn’t very dangerous. The fact that a lot more people are using it to kill themselves should be an much bigger argument for control.</p>
<p>As we have argued for before in this thread, we must remember what criminals use the guns for. They use it to scare people, while law abiding citizen might overreact to the situation.</p>
<p>Back to the case of making your own firearm, how would you do it?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Prescience:</span><br>
“Does anyone really picture a futuristic society where civilians still carry guns (or their future equivalent)?”<br>
Yes, as we would always need a some security if something went wrong.</p>
<p>“Immediate bans need to be made on all guns that aren’t immediately useful in civilian life. Their is no need for automatic weaponry, huge stockpiles of ammunition, or entire personal arsenals in any pro-gun argument.”<br>
You did forget my pro-gun argument, revolution. If you want to throw away the oppressive government/ruling class you need to be armed. You could distribute your extra guns/firearms to your comrades, and provide ammo for everyone.</p>
<p>"Long term solutions need to be found. It follows the basis of nuclear disarmament either we destroy it or somebody will be stupid enough or insane enough to let it destroy us (guns won’t destroy us but they will kill MANY innocent people). "<br>
If you follow the basic for nuclear warfare, you need to make sure the only winning move is not to play.</p>
<p>“Honestly as soon as effective and safe stun guns are invented only military entities (not police etc) will have use for shoot-to-kill weapons, and that is only because their enemies will have them.”<br>
How are we going to fight the military with stun guns? We need the terror balance, the rulers can’t be the only one in charge of weapons.</p>
<p>Just to make it clear, I do not support the use of firearms for public use, protecting against non-lethal crimes or more serious crimes if death could be avoided.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well it’s quite obvious you can’t just stick it together, so you are correct saying that regular people wouldn’t be able to assemble one, because you’d need knowledge in welding and whatever else. I’m not saying you would be able to make a gun from scratch, you’d need to obtain the parts unless you can somehow manage to create them…but the actual structure of a gun is not complex, which I’m sure you know. That’s the reason airsoft weapons are expensive, because they are much more complex than the actual model.</p>
<p>There are also several types of criminals. I’m a bit confused what you mean by, “using it to scare people”. If a person with a gun wants to murder, he will murder. I do however agree that using firearms for suicidal acts is a huge issue as well. The gun is only as bad as the person holding it.</p>

<p>Oh sure. Brilliant solution. Remove all legally owned guns from a population where mass quantities of guns may be owned by criminals. I’m not a pro-gun person but you’re absolutely fucking insane if you think removing guns will solve anything.</p>

        <p>We need to fight the origin of crime and not crime it self. But limiting the availability of guns to people who can’t handle them isn’t stupid.</p>
<p>What I would do is to limit the access to guns, decriminalize narcotics and raise the legal drinking order (In that order). To get away with some of the organized crime and violence. And if we could, force men to respect woman and get rid of poverty, and by that greatly reduce two other types of criminality.</p>

I have reasons to think that 25 years should be the legal limit (Yes, it is not going to be popular). The reason for this is that youth are overrepresented in violence, bad driving and crimes. The brain is fully developed at that age, and why should we make that age even higher? Alternative only raise the limit for buying alcohol to 25 years and be stricter against businesses who sell alcohol to people under the limit.</p>

Where I live (the country), nearly everyone drinks beer by the age of 16. Whether you are partying or just hanging out with some family. However, all of the stores are very strict on carding people. My friend’s dad was pissed off because he was carded when trying to buy a 12 pack of Budweiser. He has gray hair and looks over the age of 50, but the store’s policy is to card everyone no matter what they look like. So increasing the age to buy/drink liquor will probably have no effect where I live.</p>

<p>This. I can get alcohol whenever I want. Doesn’t mean I will, but I most certainly can.</p>
<p>Raising the drinking age won’t work, it’ll just piss a lot of people off.</p>

        <p>t4: We can’t ban alcohol, and that would be to harsh. If I one day become a dictator I might ban it, but there would of course be no support of something like that. Rising the legal age of buying alcohol is something that should be considered. While I found nobody that support my 25 year limit, there is a majority of people in Denmark that want to raise the limit from 16 to 18. There is also health recommendation for raising out 18 year limit to 20. Claiming that it won’t work is very pessimistic.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:56, topic:451525”]t4: We can’t ban alcohol, and that would be to harsh. If I one day become a dictator I might ban it, but there would of course be no support of something like that. Rising the legal age of buying alcohol is something that should be considered. While I found nobody that support my 25 year limit, there is a majority of people in Denmark that want to raise the limit from 16 to 18. There is also health recommendation for raising out 18 year limit to 20. Claiming that it won’t work is very pessimistic.</p>

I imagine you are sarcastic. Read every post in this thread and you would get an answer on every claim you making there.[/quote]<br>
Banning alchohol wasnt very successful in America. it actually increased crime rate in major cities according to wikipedia. I’m not trying to be pessimistic, but rather realistic. If the age limits dont work now, what says they will work when you increase them?</p>

        <p>The Wanderer: I said “We can’t ban alcohol…”. There you have it, I agree with you. While I don’t think alcohol should be legal, it would do no good making it illegal. As stated earlier, I think 18 years are too young, they are shown as the stupidest age group when it comes to crime, driving and drunkenness. Studies have also shown that the later you begin to drink the better.</p>
<p>I have myself broken the law when it comes to buying age restricted tobacco to underaged (He was 17, the limit is 18). Would a 25 year old do the same? Maybe, maybe not. I would think people would think before they bought alcohol to a 15 year old if he was even further from the legal age.</p>
<p>For yes, getting alcohol and tobacco is pretty for people under 18, I can’t deny that.</p>

<p>Yes. I know 40 year olds who buy for under aged people. Raising the limit to 18 would work in Norway but not in the US seeing as our age limit is already 21. It’s low enough to wear people do respect it and the people that don’t respect it understand why it is illegal to them until the age of 21.</p>
