    <description>Well first off ima let you all know i havnt started the coding cause my computer crashed and im using my brother computer that i cant download on. when i get my new computer im gonna be working on this new project for a while. I already got an idea of what i wanna do with it but i figured if i made a thread to talk bout ideas and all it can help me inprove my goals.

OKay so far ive desided im gonna go back to coding a delta, im gonna either find a base with fixed combat or ima us delta&#39;s origianal base and work on fixing it. Its gonna be a project for play and its gonna be alot like rs used to be when i used to love playing, whips, barrows, d bows, dds was all like the best things to have for pking. Im talking bout before gs&#39;s and pvp armors came out. I want it to be somewhat difficult to level, I dont want people to play for couple hours and be maxed. I have not decided on a set xp yet but ima change it and test before i open server and make sure i like xp rate. I want to make monsters drop low cash and try and fix prices to be as close to rs was back in about 2004 as possible without messing with econemy. I plan on working on a way to have to go to a different spot to get each skill cape and i will probley try and use the quest cape and change reqs. so that you can get it at lvl 126. I am gonna make a big skilling area with everything in it and i think i got a good spot for it but im not saying cause i dont want other people to use it but if you got a good idea let me know. I got tons more planned out but thats the basics, please let me know what yall think and feel free to throw me some ideas. please dont be to critical lol i really only want serrious posts please.</description>

              <p>sorry if yall miss understood me. i am wanting to code a rsps no make my own game. but im wanting to start rsps from either a really basic base with nothing on it (a blank map) or start from delta but btw i plan on changing alot more then just skilling area. i was just giving an example. BTW any one know if there is a source that is basicaly a blank map but i need wild levels to work perfectly i will add monsters, shops, and other npc’s myself. but i had trouble fixing combat on delta when i was trying to make it like 2speced was.</p>

Your next comeback might be something like, "That wasn't a put-down, I was just imagining of what he might do..", and that is pretty much slang for saying someone is a leecher.

              <p>Well first off ima let you all know i havnt started the coding cause my computer crashed and im using my brother computer that i cant download on. when i get my new computer im gonna be working on this new project for a while. I already got an idea of what i wanna do with it but i figured if i made a thread to talk bout ideas and all it can help me inprove my goals.</p>
<p>OKay so far ive desided im gonna go back to coding a delta, im gonna either find a base with fixed combat or ima us delta’s origianal base and work on fixing it. Its gonna be a project for play and its gonna be alot like rs used to be when i used to love playing, whips, barrows, d bows, dds was all like the best things to have for pking. Im talking bout before gs’s and pvp armors came out. I want it to be somewhat difficult to level, I dont want people to play for couple hours and be maxed. I have not decided on a set xp yet but ima change it and test before i open server and make sure i like xp rate. I want to make monsters drop low cash and try and fix prices to be as close to rs was back in about 2004 as possible without messing with econemy. I plan on working on a way to have to go to a different spot to get each skill cape and i will probley try and use the quest cape and change reqs. so that you can get it at lvl 126. I am gonna make a big skilling area with everything in it and i think i got a good spot for it but im not saying cause i dont want other people to use it but if you got a good idea let me know. I got tons more planned out but thats the basics, please let me know what yall think and feel free to throw me some ideas. please dont be to critical lol i really only want serrious posts please.</p>
