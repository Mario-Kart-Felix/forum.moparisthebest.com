    <title>Need help with VPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-vps/401058</link>
    <description>Alright, well I do not know if this is the right section so if it isn&#39;t I would appreciate a mod moving it to the appropriate section,
I purchased a VPS last night, it is a Linux x64 OS, and to access it I have a built in console where i can upload files etc, when I try to compress my source into a RAR it will say when i try to upload it &quot;Not allowed in prolog&quot; or somthing similar, this is my first time running a VPS and I dont even know what to do after I upload the files, if someone could help me out it would be very much appreciated, and asap would be great. Also i have contacted customer support and they said they have no say over that seeing as they are a self managed vps, but the person said try compressing it into a .ta.gz file, I have also tried this and it still says the same thing, Could someone please help me out? my VPS is : www.Hwshosting.net
