    <description>Need help urgently please.

I bought a vps lately and im trying to run my rsps on it.. I have downloaded no ip and opened a TCP and UDP on 43594. 
Then went on to Runelocus and checked if server was online when my no ip account was running too. What else did i miss
or did i not do so it says `Online` as the server ip.

Lol what?<br>
You can’t open port 43594, the vps provider has to do that for you.</p>
