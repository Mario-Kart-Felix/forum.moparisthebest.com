    <title>Maximum 10 players ~*~Help Please~*~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/maximum-10-players-help-please/186698</link>
    <description>Ok my server begins to lag at 8-10 players and I palready posted a topic about it and found out that my computer is just junk. So I was wondering if anyone knew how to make it to where only 10 players can log onto my server and then anyone else who tried it would read &quot;World Full&quot; Or something like that. PatrickFTW was suppose to show it to me or something but never did. 

Im not sure if this is right section but I know you don&#39;t request in tutorial section so if I posted in wrong section im sorry please forgive me.  :( 

But ill be [b]HIGHLY[/b] greatful to anyone who can help me.

Thanks in advance.</description>
