    <title>Need help! People are OVER healing!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-people-are-over-healing/373426</link>
    <description>alright, well im remaking the old server we all knew as &quot;bronzescape&quot;.
it was one of my favorite server&#39;s, i do not know why,.. but anyways, yah.

so i was working on healing command, and everything worked.. but it will heal OVER 99...
or w/e your level is. and you can go as high as you want, depending on how much you click it.

HERE IS THE CODE I GOT SO FAR:
[code]	if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;healer&quot;))
	     if (myHP &gt;= 98) {
                heal = 30;
                hitDiff = -heal;
                updateRequired = true;
                hitUpdateRequired = true;
		sendMessage(&quot;You&#39;ve Heal Yourself.&quot;);
		stillgfx(444, absY, absX);
	     } else if (myHP &lt;= 98) {
		sendMessage(&quot;HEY! YOU&#39;RE ARLEADY FULLY HEALED! NO NEED FOR MORE!&quot;);
            }[/code]

i took  some stuff off a food command, from when you eat a manta, it&#39;ll heal you.
ater the else if
it had
&quot;return true&quot;
but when i compiled it said error, so i had to delete it.?? :S</description>

              <p>there is no compiling error. it works when you heal, but people are OVER healling…</p>
<p>say they got 48/9 hp… so they click it to heal, but it heals them over 99… and they can just keep clicking until they have, for example, 731/99 hp</p>
