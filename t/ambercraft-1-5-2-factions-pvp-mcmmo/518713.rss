    <title>AmberCraft 1.5.2 - Factions - PVP - MCMMO</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ambercraft-1-5-2-factions-pvp-mcmmo/518713</link>
    <description>Information!
The PVP in AmberCraft is a hard-core PVP server. We allow raiding and griefing of each other’s or others buildings. If you want to be number one then you gotta get out of spawn first? Well here at AmberCraft we have a strict no spawn killing rule. If you’re caught spawn killing you will be jailed and all of your current person items will be removed. Jail times can vary depending on where and how you’re spawn killing. This is a Faction Server, not a creative build server. Things do get griefed and it could happen to anyone, so don’t expect a plot or a protection over your house. Admins do not join Faction as per that’s against the Administrator Rules (see down). Administrators may create their own faction but for the purpose of having the tag. All items are made by you and not Admins unless in these occasions: Drop party, donation, invitation reward, and voting.
