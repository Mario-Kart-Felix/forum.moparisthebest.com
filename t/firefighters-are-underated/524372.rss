    <title>Firefighters are underated</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/firefighters-are-underated/524372</link>
    <description>Just watching the tribute ceremony for the firefighters that lost their lives fighting wild fires. People don&#39;t really seem to understand these crazy bastards run towards the fire when everyone else is running away, yet their budget is almost always cut. Half of them are probably volunteer and rarely have a standard of living that&#39;s adequate. I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s like in other countries but in the USA it seems as if the firefighters are easily taken for granted and should be respected more. I know if I see one, I especially thank them and congratulate them on their job. They&#39;re one of the only good people since I&#39;ve lost all respect for the badge (police) and that 70%(++) of police are scum.


Anyone else agree with me</description>

              <p>One thing we did at bootcamp was firefighting. Learning the classes of fires, how to contain and control them, safety equipment, etc. When you’re on a ship in the middle of the ocean packed with weapons, explosives, fuel, personnel, jets, and not to mention the nuclear reactors the last thing you want is a fire.</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to get into firefighting or to volunteer. I don’t know much but the bond between firefighters seems somewhat similar to the bond between sailors, soldiers, airmen, marines, etc. Living together, eating, showering, sleeping, etc it’s really a relationship you won’t develop any other way.</p>
<p>One thing I really hate is those people who go out walking on the street carrying weapons just to get a response from the police, I saw a video on youtube where a guy was walking around with a handgun and I believe some type of rifle, videotaping everything and the only reason he does it is to mess with the police. When the officers show up, ask his name he refuses to answer, refuses to cooperate at all. I mean yeah you have your rights but what will giving a name or talking do? If you’re an officer and you see a guy with a gun just walking around and you ignore him, say he ends up shooting somebody, how would you feel? The most the officers would do is run your name to make sure you’re not a felon, have a warrant or anything like that, and check your weapons permits; No rights violation there.</p>
<p>I respect all civil servants weather they be military, police, fire, medical. Yeah not all have the right mindset and may have their own issues but they risk themselves to help others, why judge an entire group on the actions of few, unless a specific individual gives you a reason to not respect them you should show respect where it is due.</p>

Yeah, that’s about how it ends up.  I took a haz-mat class one time where the main part of the class was decontamination.  We had to practice decontaminating ourselves, another firefighter, and then we were taught how to set up a mass decontamination system.  For self decontamination and decontaminating someone else, we had to pull an 1 3/4" line off the truck and spray and cover every inch of ourselves with water.  The mass decontamination was two engines parked next to eachother, with a fog nozzle hooked up straight to the pump with no hose (to spray from both sides) and then an aerial with a fog nozzle above.  This allowed you to just have people walk through it.  And yes, we all had to walk through it.  Structural firefighting gear does great against the heat.  But it doesn’t do much to keep you from getting wet.  By the end of that 8 hour day we were all soaked from head to toe…</p>

Yeah, the news love to glorify shit like this. They come out and be like “ITS DAY 1 OF BEING APART OF NO CITY. These residents have no services and have to squabble like peasants as lords live highly.”<br>
Then suddenly the city invites you freely to enter apart of it.</p>

I live in between 2 city’s. If I call one, they say to call the other. If I call the second one, they tell me to call the first. But at the same time my mailing address is in the first city.<br>
Because of this (my block is unincorperated) we don’t get road services, or well anything unless it’s the state company coming to cut the trees over the powerlines. We don’t even get the street plowed in Winter, the street right next to ours does though.</p>

              <p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:11, topic:524372”]There’s a firehouse near my house (imo near, like 10 blocks away) and if I ever happen to catch one of the firetrucks out, or just a firefighter, I always say thank you. Just like I would a veteran or person in the military (but it is a bit different in this case).<br>
I can’t stand police, I’ve only met 2 in the two cities I ‘live’ in that earn my respect, the rest are d bags and vaginas.[/quote]</p>
<p>You can get a discount on all kinds of insurance (in most States) if you live so near to a Firehouse.</p>

<p>Not once did I state that fact, nor did I imply that. I said the cops in the citys I live in suck (yeah, don’t ask. I live in once city, but really I live in another, but at the same time I live in neither). Now lets go back on topic</p>

              <p>Volunteer firefighter here.  Also a PA state certified EMT-B.  I’ve taken and passed the national level skills test, and just need to take the written exam to be a nationally certified EMT-B.  I’m currently waiting till August when I turn 18 to finish up my classes to become a state certified vehicle rescue technician (I’ve been trained on everything in vehicle rescue except for hydraulic tools), and I need to finish up classes to become an interior firefighter.  As volunteers we put in a lot of time and effort before we even think about beginning to fight fires and save lives.  It’s something that you can’t just do as a hobby.  It’s something that once you begin you have to be able to dedicate and potentially sacrifice your life for.  When people talk about the firefighter brotherhood, it’s something you can’t even begin to understand until you become a part of it.  You see a lot of things no one else will ever see.  And you do a lot of things most other people will never have to do.  I can tell you from experience that performing CPR on someone is one of the most physically and emotionally demanding things a person can do.  Riding in the back of an ambulance with a dead body is an experience you hope you never have to do again, but in the back of your mind know it’s something you can’t avoid.</p>
<p>Fire, EMS, and police personnel are some of the greatest people you could ever meet.  I can promise you, a real fire depart is nothing like the ones you see on TV in shows such as Chicago Fire and Rescue Me.  Those shows were made to entertain, and honestly give a bad name to first responders.</p>
<p>If you want to watch some amazing videos, check out Volunteers: The Series on YouTube.<br>

It is true that they have a quote lots of places. The drug war itself is a disaster, and any policeman involved in it, it guilty of taking away freedom from innocent people and ruing their life so for profit prisons can earn more money.</p>

I can’t stand police, I’ve only met 2 in the two cities I ‘live’ in that earn my respect, the rest are d bags and vaginas.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Why do you think that?[/quote]<br>
They treat everyone with such disrespect.<br>
One that was the SRO at my school did what he could to try and get me in trouble. One time he got a ‘tip’ that I had weapons on me, and when I got searched they found nothing. He still tried getting me suspended.<br>
Another time (same officer) i got in a verbal fight with a teacher. You know what he told me? That he doesn’t care what I say or do, I have to follow the rules or I can find a new school. He said that to me because I told him that the teacher I got in the fight with was in the wrong, and he knew it.</p>
<p>I was also pulled over at night (cops thought I was underage) for curfew. They searched me and stole my cologne. I didn’t get a ticket because I was of age.</p>
<p>Once my dad got pulled over for “Blowing a stop sign” when he actually stopped at it. The cop was on another street just barley out of view and pulled my dad over. I was actually in the car at the time. We tried fighting it and no luck.</p>
<p>The same thing happened as above to my mom two weeks later, but I wasn’t in the car and it was a different cop.</p>
<p>I have more examples too.</p>
