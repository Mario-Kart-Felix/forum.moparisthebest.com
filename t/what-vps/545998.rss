    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-vps/545998</link>
    <description>Hey. I am gunna get myself a VPS for my RSPS through Hostinger and I am not sure what OS i should use to host it with.

Here are all the choices I can have and I assume it&#39;s for Linux hosting

There is one more option which is called the Ubuntu Unity Remote Desktop

I need the VPS that suppports Remote desktop for Windows so what one should I get?

Sorry if it&#39;s in the wrong section it&#39;s related to a RSPS so I thought it would be here. If not then please can a Mod move it to the relevent place :)</description>

              <p>Kind of adding on to what sk8rdude said, the most common issue with running game servers created around windows, and then running on Linux is case-sensitivity. Window’s isn’t case sensitive when it comes to finding directories, however Linux is, so there’s a very high chance you’re going to run into file not found exceptions and what not. The solution is just to go back through your code and make sure that path strings and what not match the same letters and cases as the folders and files for your server.</p>

              <p>Most if not all remote desktop programs should be compatible with Windows/Linux since they run mostly on port 3389.<br>
Most of those, actually all of those, are just different versions of Linux. So really you could just pick whatever flavor you wanted.<br>
Java is Linux compatible, but you have to make sure your server isn’t configured in any way to run only on a windows (best way to check is by compiling and running it on a linux).</p>
