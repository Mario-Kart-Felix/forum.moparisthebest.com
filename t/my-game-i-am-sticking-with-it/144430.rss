    <title>My game, I am sticking with it</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-game-i-am-sticking-with-it/144430</link>
    <description>Well lately i have wanted to dig myself out of many holes, and one thought was to create something partly challenging. I have made a login client and server. With many thanks to proto for giving me the reference to understand. When logged in it sends 2 packets to the server and the server responds and sends pack that everything is a-ok.

I am sticking with this project. Eventually connecting it to a update server i have set.

I am taking a break for about a day to develop a quick and simple 2 person chatroom for a quick refresher of what im doing.

If you dont have anything nice to say, dont post at all. I know that it isnt much, but is alot for me to process for the time being.</description>

In my humble experience, it is usually better to make the game first and then build the login interface around that.<br>

i was just about to post this, seeing as thats how i made pokemons, i made the walking etc before making it connect anywhere, its a lot easier to test and etc without having to connect somewhere[/quote]</p>
<p>Hey lawl, you wouldn’t happen to still have that Multiplayer Pokemon source would you  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> ?</p>
