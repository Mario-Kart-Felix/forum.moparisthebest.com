    <description>[center]
I&#39;m working on some Visual Changes to my Client such as sprites, Crowns, textures, Models and I can&#39;t figure this out.

I&#39;ll put a picture of my client below [With Edits] And the totally black areas are the places I need help with. [b]What should I put there[/b]? a texture of some kind or give me a picture

Also I tried removing the mapback both in sprites and cache and it worked but when my minimap changed(something moved or you move the camera) the dots will blurr. [b]How do i fix it?[/b]

current client

Edits are to keep the sprites a secret so none of my players will see it before i want them to</description>
