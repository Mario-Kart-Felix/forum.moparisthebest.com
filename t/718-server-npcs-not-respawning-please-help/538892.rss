    <description>For some reason my npc&#39;s wont respawn on my 718!! Its really irritating because I have the respawn delay set up and everything. They just wont respawn for some odd reason. If somebody could help me out that would be great because i&#39;ve been trying to figure it out for a few days now. Could somebody please help me out with this?:/ it wont let any rock crabs respawn, any bosses, any npcs you can kill Its just irritating because this has been going on for more than 3 days now!
