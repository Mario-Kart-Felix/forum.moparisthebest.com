    <description>Hi, im Ringed, i need help with hosting a server, i&#39;ve traced the problem to either a hardrive problem or a source, (most likely a combination of two). Its that people can connect easily and normally one click to my serv sometimes, but then after a little while, they have to click hundreds of times to get in. i dont know whats wrong, my servers on all the time.  If it matters at all i use a dell.</description>
