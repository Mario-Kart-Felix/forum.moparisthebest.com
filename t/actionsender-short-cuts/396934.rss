    <description>[code=java5]/**
actionSender &quot;Short-Cuts&quot;
*/

public void sendMessage(String message) {
	actionSender.sendMessage(message);
}

public void sendGlobalMessage(long usernameHash, int rank, String message) {
	actionSender.sendGlobalMessage(usernameHash, rank, message);
}	

public void sendNotification(String notification) {
	actionSender.sendNotification(notification);
}	

public void sendAlert(String message, boolean big) {
	actionSender.sendAlert(message, big);
}	

public void sendQuestStarted(int questID) {
	actionSender.sendQuestStarted(questID);
}

public void sendCompletedQuest(int questID) {
	actionSender.sendQuestFinished(questID);
}

public void sendFriendUpdate(long usernameHash, byte online) {
	actionSender.sendFriendUpdate(usernameHash, online);
}[/code]

Doing this for everything used publicly saved about 5-10kB on the JAR size. It makes the code smaller and nicer to write.

[font=courier]player.getActionSender().sendMessage()[/font] is now [font=courier]player.sendMessage()[/font] and so on.</description>

No benchmarks necessary, its common sense if you know how java operates. Its also something that most sources already have in some form and is quite basic. Its just really nothing new.[/quote]</p>
<p>If you knew how Java worked, you’d realize that the method will probably be inlined.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you’re crying about performance when the performance decrease it <span class="bbcode-i">might</span> create is completely negligible compared to large amounts of other code in the rest of the application.</p>
<p>Not only that, but you’re trying to micro-manage everything, and encourage pre-mature optimizations; you need to settle the fuck down, and actually profile the code.</p>

<p>I just checked an old copy of RSCEmulation and getActionSender() was being sent 1,043 times making the JAR size roughly 25kB bigger. I know JAR size doesn’t really matter but the code reduction is big and at the end of the day it’s personal preference. I’d sooner not see getActionSender() 1,043 times throughout my source code and I’d also sooner not type it every-time I add a new line of code that uses it (which is actually very often).</p>

<p>But the previous way wasn’t like that… You’re flaming my way when the original way is slower. It seems like you’re just doing it because you want to argue.</p>
<p>The JAR size is smaller by roughly 25kB.<br>
The code has been reduced dynamically affecting 1,043 lines of code.<br>
The new way is quicker on the 10 tests I ran.<br>
The only developer of the source code prefers it.</p>
<p>It seems to be a win-win situation to me.</p>

If getActionSender().XXXX() appears n times in your code then it makes 2n method calls, same with your modification. How about you do getActionSender() on top of the method body and store it, then make calls on it directly, n + 1 calls. Don’t modify RSCD in a way that makes it even worse than it is. If you care about JAR size just use an obfuscator that attempts to use single character field/method names.</p>

Seriously… you are still calling the same methods as the original way, you are just making it call a method, that calls another method. Its like shipping, you can send something to a distribution center before shipping it to the destination(what you did). Or you can ship it directly to the final destination(way it was done originally), which do you think would be faster?</p>

<p>Also, atleast I would prefer not to mix code that relates to the domain of a project with code that relates to network stuff, no matter the conveniency. In this case, the part I refer to domain code is Player and the ActionSender does send data over the network, so that’s the “network stuff” I am referring to. But of course, the network stuff were part of the domain even before you changed it, so I do not blame you. So it might aswell be “OK” for this project.</p>

Was this really worthy of its own topic, its not really hard to figure out. It also takes longer for the code to perform any action doing this.<br>

Is any topic really worth its own topic? Who cares? If you don’t like the thread then move to another one.</p>
<p>And how do you know it takes longer? Do you have any benchmarks to back up what you’re saying?[/quote]</p>
<p>Method calls take time, but it’s usually negligible.  And when it’s not, it gets dealt with behind the scenes.</p>

<p>The time it takes for method calls is pretty much negligible, and if it is cumbersome, I’m sure the JVM will inline it, or compile it to native code.</p>

<p>Doing this for everything used publicly saved about 5-10kB on the JAR size. It makes the code smaller and nicer to write.</p>
<p>[font=courier]player.getActionSender().sendMessage()[/font] is now [font=courier]player.sendMessage()[/font] and so on.</p>
