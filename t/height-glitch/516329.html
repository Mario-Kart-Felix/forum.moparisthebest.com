        <p>Hi I was on my server walking around, testing doors on buildings, and testing stairs. I was in Camelot and tested some stairs and I went up, but couldn’t go back down. So I typed ::home and I went to my EdgeVille home… But I was pretty much on top of the bank. It was like I was walking on air. I logged out, shut down the server and client, went to my character files, and changed my height from 1 to 0. Everyone else’s height is 0. After i saved the character file, I even compiled it. I went to run my server again, and I was still in mid-air. I then went back to my character files and it changed my height back to 1. Can anyone please help? Thanks!<br>
-------------------EDITED------------------------<br>
I fixed this problem myself. I used my Command ::shops and went down stairs and i fixed it.</p>
