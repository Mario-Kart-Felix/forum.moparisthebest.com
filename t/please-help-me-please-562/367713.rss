    <description>I&#39;m using Runeslayer which is a 562 revision server, and I really need some help.

Okay when I have the ip 127.0.0.1 in client.java client sided it will connect for me, but when I put my no-ip it doesnt work.

I changed all the ip&#39;s (2) client sided to my ip, and I .rared it and uploaded it. My friends tried to play but it didnt work.

Exactly what folders do I have to modify in Client ? And do I have to change anything in Source?
Please guys, I have been doing this 7 hours straight, and I&#39;m tired, I really just want this server online.. Please..</description>
