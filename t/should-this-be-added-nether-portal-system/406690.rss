    <title>Should this be added? [Nether portal system]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-this-be-added-nether-portal-system/406690</link>
    <description>Well recently I built myself a portal to the Nether.
the way the current system works is if there is another portal within 1024 blocks (X and Z), then your portal will link to one already made in the nether. BUT when you return, you will be sent to the players portal that created the portal. (As in, they build a portal, it makes one in the nether... your portal links to the one in the nether due to the check.. when you leave, you will be sent to the other players portal).

in my opinion, this is a HUGE inconveniance, because the nearest portal to my house is about 600 blocks away over mountains, and rivers and the like.

I was browsing the bucket forum looking for a fix, and I found this: [url=http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/tp-fix-unether-v0-1-get-back-to-your-own-nether-portal-1000.22896/#post-510279]http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/tp-fix-unether-v0-1-get-back-to-your-own-nether-portal-1000.22896/#post-510279[/url]

it keeps track of what portal you enter. your portal will still go to the one that was created by the first person, but when you leave, it will send you to your OWN portal, instead of the other players.

I think this would be a great addition.. So if you support, Please say so :D</description>

Oh I read the thread about your minecart track.<br>
I hadn’t seen the latest replies, seems that Mopar will be adding some residence thing.</p>
<p>but either way, how will that allow us to build in that area?.. you can’t build in other people’s residence?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>The residence would just be in the regular world to protect spawn, not in the nether.</p>
<p>About this plugin, not a bad idea, but doesn’t it not allow you to actually travel through the nether?  From a quick look at the code, it will teleport you back to the portal you came through regardless of which portal you go through:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/Ulrar/uNether/blob/master/net/ulrar/unether/uNetherPL.java" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Ulrar/uNether/blob/master/net/ulrar/unether/uNetherPL.java</a><br>
Example:<br>
You go through your nether portal, it is saved, you travel 1000 blocks in the nether (8000 in the real world) and come to my nether portal and go through, wanting to come out on my land, right?  But your position is saved and it shoots you back out your nether portal again.</p>
<p>Does it not work like that?[/quote]</p>
<p>I did have a look through his github, but thats something I didnt think about…<br>
Wonder if there’s a way to modify it to check if you enter back through the portal you were sent to, or another one…<br>
Maybe I should have a look through the bukkit API and see what I can come up with…</p>
<p>on the other hand, just adding the residence to the normal world would also be convenient. it would also solve the problem for noobs are ftw.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/noobs">@noobs</a> are ftw, sorry, didn’t realise… i was just skipping through the posts and i thought i saw his name pop us somewhere in relation to building it =P</p>

              <p>[quote=“k4den, post:1, topic:406690”]Well recently I built myself a portal to the Nether.<br>
the way the current system works is if there is another portal within 1024 blocks (X and Z), then your portal will link to one already made in the nether. BUT when you return, you will be sent to the players portal that created the portal. (As in, they build a portal, it makes one in the nether… your portal links to the one in the nether due to the check… when you leave, you will be sent to the other players portal).</p>
<p>in my opinion, this is a HUGE inconveniance, because the nearest portal to my house is about 600 blocks away over mountains, and rivers and the like.</p>
<p>I was browsing the bucket forum looking for a fix, and I found this: <a href="http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/tp-fix-unether-v0-1-get-back-to-your-own-nether-portal-1000.22896/#post-510279" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/tp-fix-unether-v0-1-get-back-to-your-own-nether-portal-1000.22896/#post-510279</a></p>
<p>it keeps track of what portal you enter. your portal will still go to the one that was created by the first person, but when you leave, it will send you to your OWN portal, instead of the other players.</p>
<p>I think this would be a great addition… So if you support, Please say so :D[/quote]<br>
lol noob,<br>
just devide you portals coords by 8 and find it in the nether and light it up, if its not there make on at that spot.</p>
