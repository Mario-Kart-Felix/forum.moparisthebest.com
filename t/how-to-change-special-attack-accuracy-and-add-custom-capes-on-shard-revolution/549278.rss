    <title>How to change Special Attack accuracy and add custom capes on Shard Revolution</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-change-special-attack-accuracy-and-add-custom-capes-on-shard-revolution/549278</link>
    <description>If someone can please help me change Special Attack accuracy on a particular weapon, and add custom capes on a shard revolutions base it would be super appreciated.

For custom capes, I followed a tutorial for PI/Delta bases and set it up and the custom cape in the shop. It shows up but gives an ArrayOutOfBounds error. I tried for hours to fix it but I can&#39;t find a way to fix it. I added the ID to the class8.java file server side, added the int to Item.java, under the capes[] array but no matter what I change it giving the outofbounds error. 

For the special attack accuracy, I don&#39;t see any way to edit it. The only thing I can change is the damage multiplier.

Any help/pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you so much!</description>
