    <description>From july 2002

[code][16:17] &lt;mrandrew&gt; hello 
[16:17] &lt;mrandrew&gt; I&#39;ve adjusted some setting on the NY servers, they might be less laggy now 
[16:18] &lt;mrandrew&gt; the database is also on a kickass dual-xeon machine :-) which has solved the other problems I think 

[16:18] &lt;Fudgy999&gt; cool, any idea how long till nxt update? 
[16:18] &lt;mrandrew&gt; well paul stayed behind on holiday so I&#39;ll do the next content update when he gets back on monday 
[16:19] &lt;mrandrew&gt; might be tuesday depending if it needs much testing 
[16:19] = Sausageeater gets excited that monkeys might feature in the jungle area :-) 
[16:20] &lt;mrandrew&gt; the jungle won&#39;t have monkeys initially, but they are on our artists list of things to do 

[16:20] &lt;Fudgy999&gt; Hey andrew, could you giv us a breif on wot the &#39;battle feild&#39; will actually be? 
[16:20] &lt;Tseng_V_V&gt; hey the jungle only for members? 
[16:20] &lt;mrandrew&gt; the battlefield is just an area of map, it&#39;s a bit training area with 2 armies, so lots of stuff to fight 
[16:21] &lt;Fudgy999&gt; are the 2 armies npc? 
[16:21] &lt;mrandrew&gt; and it has nice battle scenery, like discarded weapons and spear walls, and various fortifications 
[16:21] &lt;mrandrew&gt; it&#39;s part of one of the new quests as well yes 
[16:21] &lt;mrandrew&gt; yes npc 
[16:21] &lt;Tseng_V_V&gt; for members? 
[16:21] &lt;mrandrew&gt; yep it&#39;s 4 members 
[16:21] &lt;Fudgy999&gt; and the npcs will attack eachother? that would be call 
[16:21] &lt;Fudgy999&gt; cool* 
[16:21] &lt;Tony&gt; Cool, the 411 straight from Andrew 
[16:22] &lt;das1330&gt; how about the treetop village? 
[16:22] &lt;mrandrew&gt; the engine doesn&#39;t allow us to make npcs fight each other at the moment, although I&#39;d love to add that in 

[16:22] &lt;mrandrew&gt; the treetop village I&#39;m very impressed with because I didn&#39;t think it was possible and then one of our guys went and did it! 
[16:22] &lt;XxATTICxX&gt; Andrew cna you answer a question i knwo alot of ppl needa know 
[16:22] &lt;Fudgy999&gt; npc battle , and players pick a side and join in! 
[16:22] &lt;Tseng_V_V&gt; there should be a place that you have to teleport to to get to 
[16:22] &lt;XxATTICxX&gt; Why do we pay more with a check 

[16:23] &lt;mrandrew&gt; if you buy 12 months it&#39;s the same price, it you buy 6 or 2 it slightly more because the agency paybycash adds their own charge on top for handling the payment 
[16:23] &lt;Tseng_V_V&gt; hey andrew are there any new things for the free version ever coming up? 
[16:23] &lt;mrandrew&gt; yes, new graphics 
[16:23] &lt;XxATTICxX&gt; andrew will free be gettin those new models too? 
[16:23] &lt;mrandrew&gt; yes 

[16:24] &lt;XxATTICxX&gt; you will be 5 bucks richer next week lol 

[16:24] &lt;Tseng_V_V&gt; cause ive done all the quests so its kinda boring having everything the same 

[16:24] &lt;mrandrew&gt; once I&#39;m happy the rs problem is fixed the new graphics is the next thing on my list 
[16:25] &lt;XxATTICxX&gt; andrew the 22nd is that big update right? 


[16:25] &lt;mrandrew&gt; will be 22nd or 23rd I expect 
[16:25] &lt;mrandrew&gt; I tried playing RS over my mobile phone and laptop on holiday 
[16:26] &lt;mrandrew&gt; amazingly it worked, a bit expensive tho! 
[16:26] &lt;mrandrew&gt; in game I&#39;m called Andrew 
[16:26] &lt;MattX&gt; Andrew, what are the holidays when party hats are dropped? 
[16:26] &lt;mrandrew&gt; but I tend to hide in quiet bits of the map to avoid getting mobbed 
[16:26] &lt;Tks&gt; Any new skills in the near future? 
[16:26] &lt;mrandrew&gt; party hats are christmas 

[16:27] &lt;MattX&gt; Yeah that bug that lets u walk in void space from falador outside of the walls at varrock museum 
[16:27] &lt;mrandrew&gt; another void space bug? 
[16:27] &lt;XxATTICxX&gt; tahst it theres also one in falador castle 
[16:27] &lt;XxATTICxX&gt; whirte knights one 
[16:27] &lt;mrandrew&gt; ok I will get paul to fix it when he gets back from holiday 
[16:28] &lt;Tseng_V_V&gt; in falador castle you can climb up ladders to tell peoples levels 
[16:28] &lt;mrandrew&gt; hmm nope godlys bank is empty 
[16:29] &lt;Fudgy999&gt; andrew, jagex cam is pointing to the ceiling! 
[16:30] &lt;mrandrew&gt; hmm yep the jagex.com computer got turned into a linux box 
[16:30] &lt;mrandrew&gt; I need to setup a replacement 
[16:30] &lt;mrandrew&gt; jagex cam I mean 
[16:31] &lt;mrandrew&gt; but the jagex ceiling is very nice :-=) 
[16:32] &lt;mrandrew&gt; not many people know about the cam 
[16:33] &lt;mrandrew&gt; lol, I don&#39;t mind, although mrnorris doesn&#39;t have much bandwidth :-) 
[16:33] &lt;mrandrew&gt; can anyone here tell me if the NY servers seem better today? 
[16:33] &lt;MattX&gt; yeah sure hold on andrew 
[16:33] &lt;Tks&gt; ill try it out, they are next door to me 
[16:33] &lt;Tony&gt; New York servers always lag hard Andrew 
[16:33] &lt;mrandrew&gt; I adjust the network card to run in full-duplex, which it should have been in anyway, but apparently wasn&#39;t 
[16:33] &lt;Tony&gt; And I live in Queens NY 
[16:33] &lt;pork&gt; yea i live in MAss 
[16:33] &lt;Fudgy999&gt; no-one on server 12 
[16:33] &lt;pork&gt; and use UK servers 
[16:34] &lt;mrandrew&gt; try it now tony :-) 
[16:34] &lt;mrandrew&gt; 12 is offline 
[16:34] &lt;das1330&gt; so andrew will we get fear back maybe? and maybe a teleport to that a town 
[16:34] &lt;Thunder&gt; i only use uk ones:) 
[16:34] &lt;Tks&gt; hey, it actually does work! nice job 
[16:35] &lt;Sausageeater&gt; Andrew is there anything you can do about clint eastwood, hes lagging me into a coma? 
[16:35] &lt;Fudgy999&gt; i take that bak, quite a bit laggy for me 
[16:35] &lt;Tony&gt; I think my ISP is giving me bad lag too 
[16:35] &lt;Tks&gt; its great for me 
[16:35] &lt;mrandrew&gt; coo 
[16:36] &lt;Tony&gt; New York is doin better then Philly servers 
[16:36] &lt;Tks&gt; got about a one second lag for options menu, but stll a vast improvement 
[16:37] &lt;mrandrew&gt; ok thats good news 
[16:48] &lt;mrandrew&gt; well I&#39;m off now, thanks for testing ny server for me 
[16:49] &lt;mrandrew&gt; bye

              <p>So I came across this thread in a moment of complete boredom and deciding to Google my old Runescape name. Can’t believe that was 13 years ago… I remember playing Runescape back when there was only a single server and 2 towns. Would regularly talk to Andrew and Paul ingame and on IRC. I haven’t played it in years and eventually gave the account to my brother. Still; Interesting to see that it’s still so popular after all this time.</p>

<p><code>
&lt;MrAndrew&gt; redhat 7.1 - that's whats wrong with rs
&lt;MrAndrew&gt; e.g it's crap</code></p>
<p><code>
&lt;Von-Neumann&gt; Andrew can you refund all the hours spent on runescape please :)
&lt;MrAndrew&gt; but I didn't charge you anything?
&lt;MrAndrew&gt; I didn't MAKE you play :-)
&lt;MrAndrew&gt; so no, bog off</code></p>
<p><code>
*** MrAndrew changes topic to 'The shake thing does NOT freeze the client, or cause the lag. So shut it!'
&lt;MrAndrew&gt; I made the shaking less annoying after talking in here last night
&lt;MrAndrew&gt; it now only shakes, it doesn't rotate, which is much less dizzifying</code></p>
<p><code>
&lt;MrAndrew&gt; it's funny
&lt;MrAndrew&gt; cos you're saying pking is too hard
&lt;MrAndrew&gt; and yet the vast majority of the players
&lt;MrAndrew&gt; don't dare go out there for fear of dieing!</code></p>
<p><code>
&lt;MrAndrew&gt; I wouldn't have added it, but it's the usual case of people trying to cheat forcing me to waste time on features which inconveniance everyone else
&lt;MrAndrew&gt; the cheating is just ridculous!</code></p>
<p><code>
[00:16] &lt;Asrock&gt; andrew: are people that have been locked up for macroing locked up forever?
[00:16] &lt;@MrAndrew&gt; pretty much yes asrock, I do NOT like macroing
[00:16] &lt;@MrAndrew&gt; it's blatantly obvious when people macro
[00:17] &lt;@MrAndrew&gt; people report macroers to me and I login and go and have a look
[00:17] &lt;@MrAndrew&gt; well the people who hate the game just shouldn't play it! stands to reason</code></p>
<p><code>
[23:40] &lt;@MrAndrew&gt; had a record number of players this evening :-) I was very pleased
[23:41] &lt;@MrAndrew&gt; I saw 3067 at once!
[23:41] &lt;Kerrick&gt; i remember when we hit 1000
[23:41] &lt;@MrAndrew&gt; yep me too, I was so excited when we hit 1000 months ago
[23:41] &lt;@MrAndrew&gt; now 1000 seems like hardly any</code></p>

              <p>From july 2002</p>
<p>[code][16:17]  hello<br>
[16:17]  I’ve adjusted some setting on the NY servers, they might be less laggy now<br>
[16:18]  the database is also on a kickass dual-xeon machine <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> which has solved the other problems I think</p>
<p>[16:18]  cool, any idea how long till nxt update?<br>
[16:18]  well paul stayed behind on holiday so I’ll do the next content update when he gets back on monday<br>
[16:19]  might be tuesday depending if it needs much testing<br>
[16:19] = Sausageeater gets excited that monkeys might feature in the jungle area <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
[16:20]  the jungle won’t have monkeys initially, but they are on our artists list of things to do</p>
<p>[16:20]  Hey andrew, could you giv us a breif on wot the ‘battle feild’ will actually be?<br>
[16:20] &lt;Tseng_V_V&gt; hey the jungle only for members?<br>
[16:20]  the battlefield is just an area of map, it’s a bit training area with 2 armies, so lots of stuff to fight<br>
[16:21]  are the 2 armies npc?<br>
[16:21]  and it has nice battle scenery, like discarded weapons and spear walls, and various fortifications<br>
[16:21]  it’s part of one of the new quests as well yes<br>
[16:21]  yes npc<br>
[16:21] &lt;Tseng_V_V&gt; for members?<br>
[16:21]  yep it’s 4 members<br>
[16:21]  and the npcs will attack eachother? that would be call<br>
[16:21]  cool*<br>
[16:21]  Cool, the 411 straight from Andrew<br>
[16:22]  how about the treetop village?<br>
[16:22]  the engine doesn’t allow us to make npcs fight each other at the moment, although I’d love to add that in</p>
<p>[16:22]  the treetop village I’m very impressed with because I didn’t think it was possible and then one of our guys went and did it!<br>
[16:22]  Andrew cna you answer a question i knwo alot of ppl needa know<br>
[16:22]  npc battle , and players pick a side and join in!<br>
[16:22] &lt;Tseng_V_V&gt; there should be a place that you have to teleport to to get to<br>
[16:22]  Why do we pay more with a check</p>
<p>[16:23]  if you buy 12 months it’s the same price, it you buy 6 or 2 it slightly more because the agency paybycash adds their own charge on top for handling the payment<br>
[16:23] &lt;Tseng_V_V&gt; hey andrew are there any new things for the free version ever coming up?<br>
[16:23]  yes, new graphics<br>
[16:23]  andrew will free be gettin those new models too?<br>
[16:23]  yes</p>
<p>[16:24]  you will be 5 bucks richer next week lol</p>
<p>[16:24] &lt;Tseng_V_V&gt; cause ive done all the quests so its kinda boring having everything the same</p>
<p>[16:24]  once I’m happy the rs problem is fixed the new graphics is the next thing on my list<br>
[16:25]  andrew the 22nd is that big update right?</p>
<p>[16:25]  will be 22nd or 23rd I expect<br>
[16:25]  I tried playing RS over my mobile phone and laptop on holiday<br>
[16:26]  amazingly it worked, a bit expensive tho!<br>
[16:26]  in game I’m called Andrew<br>
[16:26]  Andrew, what are the holidays when party hats are dropped?<br>
[16:26]  but I tend to hide in quiet bits of the map to avoid getting mobbed<br>
[16:26]  Any new skills in the near future?<br>
[16:26]  party hats are christmas</p>
<p>[16:27]  Yeah that bug that lets u walk in void space from falador outside of the walls at varrock museum<br>
