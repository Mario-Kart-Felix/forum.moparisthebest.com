    <description>I use to own a few different of my own servers, but i got out of it anyways. I&#39;m co-owner of a server. The owner sent me the server file so I could script/code. Although I need to be able to compile to update the server. I got the latest JDK but thats it. Tell me all what I need to be successful at updating it.</description>
