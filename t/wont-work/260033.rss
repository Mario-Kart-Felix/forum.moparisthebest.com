    <description>Hey. I have done the tutorial on how to make a server, and ran a quite popular server for about a month, then it stopped letting other people log on. I have to use Hamachi now, which I hate. I have Portforwarded and have No-IP. I tried finding the tutorial so I could take it again but I couldn&#39;t... Has it been removed or something? If you know where it is post the link please, or tell me what&#39;s wrong :P[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 02, 2009, 08:36:59 pm[/size][hr]I retook it but it still don&#39;t work... Need help.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 03, 2009, 03:07:13 pm[/size][hr]Never mind, as usual, I was left to fix it myself, and I did so. Issue resolved.</description>
