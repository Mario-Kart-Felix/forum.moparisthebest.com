    <title>Code Question</title>

    <description>I was wondering what the code would be todo this:

For team battles, you type ::blue for a blue cape and ::green for a green one. Now, how would I make it so the person&#39;s name on the player&#39;r list AND, optionally, the name over their head, change to the team they are on?

Help would be nice.  ;)[br][size=1]Posted on: March 11, 2007, 08:29:48 AM[/size][hr]No idea? ???</description>
