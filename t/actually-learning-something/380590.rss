    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/actually-learning-something/380590</link>
    <description>well most of the threads in the help board die after a few posts because the questions are usually relatively short but i have a big question i need alot of replies to keep this bumbped so more people can help but heres my question/s

----------
I want to start a new server 317 probably, i need alot of things, because i want to actually understand what im doing,

~ i have been doing java and making java games with my friends for about a year now.

- my first question is because im making a server(or atleast want to) from nothing, just me and eclipse, where do i start, what actually puts the 3d models into the game?
-  how do u even make combat?
- is there some kind of secret packets i should know about that have to be used for something?
- how would u go about displaying graphics and animations that the characters/npcs do?
- how all of this can be loaded and integrated through java files?

---------------
im not an idiot like i said ik a deal of java progamming I just really wanted to start my own source and i need to know exactly how.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Clawz fury, post:6, topic:380590”]Do you know how long people like Blakeman, &amp; Graham have been doing RSPS, and how much experience they have with it?<br>
nearly the begginning<br>
LMFAO, you aren’t comfortable with other people’s work…? Oh god.<br>
sorry dont like to leech<br>
If you don’t know how or where to start, then why would you try and do something like this?<br>
complexity is overrated &amp; java is java no matter how u look at it, if everything in the world was easy and without challenge noone would learn anything<br>
If you don’t know anything about programming RSPS, why the hell are you going to try and create a server base? You know how long those take?<br>
i never said i wanted to make a base like hyperion or any of that, i simply stated i would like to KNOW WHAT IM DOING so i can work on it instead of blindly following tutorials like 99% of the rsps community<br>
If you are aiming for something like Hyperion, just stop, it’s not going to happen. Give it a few decades.<br>
I never said i was.<br>
My suggestion is to start off with Hyperion (for good programming habits), then once you get really good, try a base with just basic logging in and walking, and then go from there.<br>
ive been doing java for about a year now i think ik a few things about it, me 2 students and my cousin have created plenty of games to understand.<br>
Not trying to be a dick, but don’t you think this is a hell of a lot far-fetched?<br>
No i dont, I think to many people go day by day on these forums not wanting to learn anything and not trying to help any1 understand anything, they then laugh at any1 who even tries to learn anything and get angry when people leech.[/quote]</p>
<p>honestly all i wanted was to know what the hell im doing so i can atleast try to better myself, i asked a few questions and expected answers from a community that apprently knows all about rsps.</p>
<p>now can any1 actually help give me some real answers?</p>
