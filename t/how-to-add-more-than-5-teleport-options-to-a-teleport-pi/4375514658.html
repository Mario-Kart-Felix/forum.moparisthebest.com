<p>It’s not that your contribution isn’t appreciated, that’s <span class="bbcode-i">not </span>what anyone has said. They’re merely telling you, you need to follow the rules. The rules explicitly state:</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>MoparScape, you now have your chance to post code snippets. You must post them in this topic only. Posting any code snippets, aka, ‘five minute tutorials’, aka, ‘c&amp;p tutorials’, will result in the normal punishments.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What everyone has been trying to tell you is that although you took the time to explain what you’re doing here, it’s still a snippet and should be posted as such within the dedicated thread. No one has out-right bashed you nor your “snippet”* because of functionality, performance, etc, it’s only because it’s posted in the wrong section. Simply ask a Moderator to move it to a more appropriate section, or even have a Moderator post stating that this does in-fact meet the criteria to remain in this section.</p>
<p>*Snippet refers to any amount of pre-programmed code that can merely be copied and pasted within an existing class to achieve the desired effects. It’s not a derogatory term and just means that it’s short.<br>
[/quote]<br>
i asked what a snipett was and someone said it belonged to someone or somthing, noone explained what a snippet was and i thought it belonged here, neither did anyone say its in thr wrong section. There were a few who said it was a waste of time and isnt helpful so i give up no positive posts only negative, uhm maybe thats why i am a bit angry[/quote]</p>
<p>I know and no one explained what a snippet was, that’s why I did. Every time they told you it was a snippet they were implying that you should post it in the snippets thread. Daginith gave you a link to it as well, but there was a mis-understanding. He meant your original post, where you explained how to add a “more” to dialogues should have been posted there. RandQm was the only one who came close to insulting you, but what he meant is that it’s super easy and there isn’t a need for it. He wasn’t putting you down nor what your snippet of code, he was criticizing the fact that people lack the knowledge to do this themselves. Everyone has their own learning curve and no one knows everything, so there will be users who benefit from this.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I know it’s nice to receive praise for doing something. You cannot however let the responses from other’s affect you like so. Take what they’re saying and use it, so you can do even better next time.</p>
<p>P.S. I thank-you for your work and contribution for the community.</p>

<p>This is where people usually fail completely out, stop doing everything, and give up. Lemme tell ya right now, the world is full of enough quitters to kill us all.</p>
<p>A snippit is more or less a small explained code, similar to the one you have here. It is nothing grand, large, earth-shattering, but it is beneficial. They are separated for people to have an easier time of looking. For example, if I want to know how to make a ring do something when I wear it (2 codes additions at the most) I would look through the snippet. If I want the tutorial on the proper way to open the Underground Pass Quest, I would definitely look in the tutorials due to the shear size of it.</p>
<p>I will agree with explanations of how and or why the code is as it is. For you, me and everyone else, this is a no brainer to understand.<br>
But the new people, who do not ask questions due in part to the flaming they see on other posts have no idea. Not saying spoon feed them everything either. They do need to learn something. But it helps them understand the where, why and hows. That is basically what people are trying to say. Just accept all the criticism, steam over it, be angry, but do not stop. Gives them the victory anyways…Why on earth would you want to do that?</p>
