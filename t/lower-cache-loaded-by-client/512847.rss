    <title>Lower cache loaded by client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lower-cache-loaded-by-client/512847</link>
    <description>Basically what I want to try to do is make it so my client and source loads a lower cache. Perhaps to reduce some lag. The source I&#39;m using is Rune-Evolution 742. I&#39;d like to lower this down to maybe 728 or so. How would I go about doing this? Would I just switch out the cache in the server and change the cache in the location my client loads it from? Would I have to edit any files in the client?

    Also, if someone could provide a 718/728 cache, that would be appreciated as well. Fully packed.. Maps, items, whatever else..

  Thank you in advance 

 Edit: Also, if you know any other ways to reduce lag within this server.. Would be much appreciated as well :)</description>

<p>Find memory leaks within the server and fix them.<br>
Get a vps?<br>
Better internet?<br>
More RAM for the computer?</p>

              <p>The lag has nothing to do with your cache.<br>
Plus, if you do this, a lot of items in your game may not work anymore, or not be there.</p>
