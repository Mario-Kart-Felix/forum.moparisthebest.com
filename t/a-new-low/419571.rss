<p>OK well I’ll have to try and dig up the article I read because IIRC there are actually hard drive forensics out there that claim to be able to recover data from overwritten hard drives and ones that have even been for the most part, destroyed.</p>

              <blockquote>This challenge is hilarious. I don't see why anyone with the capability of doing this (if they exist) would take the challenge.
<p>The prize is a joke. It’s just a total of only $100, and $60 of that comes in the form of a 2nd-hand HDD (which would probably have to be disassembled and mangled beyond usability if any data would be retrieved from it).</p>
<p>The remaining $40 would barely cover the needed funding of such an undertaking.</p>
<p>There are some (older) HDD models that can have some data recovered with an MFM microscrope, and even a DoD-standard 7-pass wipe can be somewhat recovered using a scanning electron microscope.</p>
<p>Good luck getting people or organizations who have access to such equipment to take your challenge for $40.</p>
<p>I’d imagine that when this is actually needed (like the DoD needing to analyze a wiped HDD recovered from a terrorist hideout), and that they’d take more than 30 days (the 3 days limit also seems to be a joke as well, even 30 days seems to be short), and $40 will barely cover the expenses. And don’t expect HDD to be in any usable state afterwards.</p>
<p>But the most hilarious part was the requirement of revealing the methods used for recovery. It’s like saying “we’ll buy your secrets for $40, and an 80gb harddrive”.</p>
<p>It’s like posting a challenge to crack RSA for $100, then demanding them to release their results if they manage to do so.</p>
<p>If we even believe the urban legend that NSA has cracked RSA, they would not even want anyone to know it is possible. And they will NOT release how to do so in a reproducible manner.</p>

<p>You sure? I’m sure I’ve read of computer forensics recovering data from HDDs that have had all sorts of shit done to them. Are we talking a single rewrite here or multiple iterations?</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Found this on the ibot website; just thought you guys might want to see this as of to what happened…</p>
<blockquote>Threatening Emails
On Tuesday, October 25th, Jagex contacted many of our customers via email stating that they had "strong evidence that you may have purchased and used botting software in the past, specifically ibot software". The email later goes on to threaten that if you do not stop botting you may be named in a lawsuit based on DMCA violations which is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Since then, there have been many rumors spreading throughout the community as to how Jagex got a hold of, and planned to use this information.
<p>Earlier this year, Jagex’s lawyers subpoenaed PayPal for information regarding purchase information of bot customers. Knowing how sensitive this information is, and how much we care about our customers, our lawyers immediately responded to this subpoena to question their intentions. Their lawyers specifically made it clear that this information would not be shown to any Jagex employees. To ensure this, we filed a protective order on the information with the courts to make it illegal for their lawyers to show any of the information to Jagex employees.</p>
<p>Later this summer, Jagex illegally circumvented the protective order. To dupe the courts, Jagex filed a separate suit in the California Federal Court (Jagex Limited vs. John Does). The courts in the State of California did not know about the protective order, and granted Jagex’s lawyers access to the PayPal information again with another subpoena for that case. Of course, this time, there was no protective order. This is a mockery of the U.S. legal system.</p>
<p>We were not made aware of these actions by Jagex until we learned of the emails going out this past Tuesday. Since then, our lawyers have been preparing an emergency motion to submit to the courts explaining what Jagex has done, and the demands we have regarding their actions. This filing was submitted to the courts and made public today. The filing can be publicly read from a PDF document here. If this interests you, we encourage you to read and then re-read this filing for a full perspective on the situation (case filing starts on page 5).</p>
<p>A notable summary of the demands made in the filing are as follows:<br>
Ordering Jagex to dismiss the case in the State of California (Jagex vs. John Does).<br>
Ordering Jagex to immediately destroy any and all information obtained from the PayPal subpoena.<br>
Ordering Jagex to take no action against any of the customers or RS accounts of the customers that they received from the subpoena.<br>
Ordering Jagex to resend an email to all affected customers retracting the statements made in the email sent out earlier this Tuesday and to publicly post an apology on their main websites stating the same.<br>
All demands can be found within the filing on pages 26-27.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that this filing is a motion to file an extended motion, so it will not contain all exhibit information. The full motion, including all exhibits, should be available Monday. We will follow up with a link to that filing when it becomes publicly available as well. Being an emergency motion, a decision of these demands by the Judge should be made within the following week. The maximum decision time is two weeks.</p>
<p>In conclusion, nothing is more important to us than our customers. We have and always will fight to protect our customers in every way possible. We are extremely apologetic for any ill-concerns this mess may have caused you. We hope by publicly keeping you informed on the situation, you all will understand this very important fact.</p>
