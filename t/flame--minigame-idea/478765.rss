    <title>[Flame_] Minigame Idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/flame--minigame-idea/478765</link>
    <description>This is an idea that I came up with for FroyoScape, tell me what you think of it. 
I give permission to anyone who wants to use the idea, just give me appropriate credits.

It is a minigame.
This goes into any of the creation skills (being fletching, crafting, magic, etc.)
You can craft a special item that you can imbue with the name of the town you are gifting it to, and present it to the king/lord/duke of the town.

[u]The Story Line:[/u]
&lt;blockquote&gt;You are in your town, and you talk to a messenger who tells you that it is the lord/vassal/duke/king/queen&#39;s birthday or any other special occasion that day.
You are given the option, with some sort of timer being set (maybe the castle wars timer method can be used), to create some sort of special gift to please the lord/vassal/duke/king/queen.
When you are done creating said gift, you talk to the messenger, and he asks if you would like him to teleport you to the lord/vassal/duke/king/queen of the area you are gifting to.
You are teleported to the town, and give the present to the lord/vassal/duke/king/queen.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[u]Where to Start the Minigame[/u]
&lt;blockquote&gt;[ul][li]Talk to a messenger that spawns in a random spot within each city&#39;s castle[/li]
[li]You can only take part in this minigame once every 5 days, thus leaving the hostility aspect of the game still in affect.[/li][/ul]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[u]The Requirements:[/u]
&lt;blockquote&gt;For Fletching:

[ul][li]No requirements besides those existing fletching requirements[/li][/ul]

For Crafting:

[ul][li]No requirements besides those existing crafting requirements[/li][/ul]

For Imbuing(Magic):

[ul][li]To imbue is to mark the name of the town you are gifting to, into the present.[/li]
[li]In order to imbue, you are required to have at least level 20 magic, depending on the tier of imbueing you wish to complete.[list]
[li]Tier 1: You imbue the name of the town into the gift (requires level 20 magic)[/li]
[li]Tier 2: You imbue the name of gifted into the gift (requires level 45 magic)[/li]
[/list][/li]
[li]The gifts are trade-able, thus letting you trade gifts to other players in order to have them imbued for skillers[/li][/ul]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[u]The Rewards:[/u]
&lt;blockquote&gt;[ul][li]You are gifted generously in a set amount of gold coins[/li]
[li]You are given a title that says the name of the town you have gifted to[/li]
[li]The burden of hostility in the town is temporary lifted from your shoulders, this will last 2 days[/li][/ul]&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
