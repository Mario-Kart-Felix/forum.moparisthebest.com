    <title>667/728 Item&#39;s only sell for 1 gp to shops</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-728-items-only-sell-for-1-gp-to-shops/465849</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve worked with 317&#39;s before, but things in this 667/728 are really different. Everything has the buy prices I want, but when I go to sell something to a store to make money I get the message &quot;shop will buy for: 0 coins. Right-click to sell&quot;. And then when I go to sell, I actually get 1 coin back. I need to fix it, but I can&#39;t figure out how, And I really have given it a hard try before coming here to ask.

*p.s. Everything is packed in .s and .e files and so on, so there is no .cfg for me to mess with...
Well there is a prices.cfg, but it only affects the G.E. prices (don&#39;t currently have selling in my ge...)


EDIT: 
Here is the code from shop.java that I believe has to do with the problem..


int price = getSellPrice(item, dq);
		player.getPackets().sendGameMessage(
				item.getDefinitions().getName()
						+ &quot;: shop will buy for: &quot;
						+ price
						+ &quot; &quot;
						+ ItemDefinitions.getItemDefinitions(money).getName()
								.toLowerCase()
						+ &quot;. Right-click the item to sell.&quot;);</description>

              <p>I sent you a message in your inbox cause im not quite sure which file would be the item.cfg, and I dont think I would know what to do from there. I’m so brain dead from getting all the bugs from this server that I can’t even think.</p>
<p>EDIT: Think I found the item.cfg, its a packed file called bonuses.ib and there is also one called bonuses.ib~. Those are the only ones…are the prices all in there with the stats?</p>
