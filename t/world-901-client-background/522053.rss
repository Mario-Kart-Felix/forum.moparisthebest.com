    <description>I would like a client background. 

[u][b]Theme[/b] [/u] 
[b]What you think of when you read this: 20 of Runescape&#39;s worst rulebreakers are put in to World 901, an abandoned and corrupt world, which Jagex covers under the name of an instant demo in March 2010.
Only one can survive and win their freedom...[/b]

[u][b]Color[/b][/u]
[b]Bloody, with a mix of mystery.[/b]

[u][b]Texture[/b][/u]
[b]Metallic, earthy, and with that dripping blood effect.[/b]

[b][u]Text[/u][/b]
[b]Text should be placed at the top of the image. I would like it with that dripping blood effect. Like this:[/b]

              <p>Actually, that’s just the moral (or lore as you can say) of the server. There are two worlds, world 1 and world 901. World 901 is all pking, but world 1 really has features that are like any rsps, but with a twist <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>I want to give it a shot! There’s just one problem: I don’t remember what size the client background is, there’s also the thing I’d want to know what the loginbox and buttons look like + their sizes? I like the idea of this so much I want to give something finally to this community and this seems like a good place to start! There’s still the other side of the coin that bothers me: do the worst rule-breakers really want their “freedom”, or is this something like they’re trapped into this world without option to continue their life if not attending this? These thoughts come into my mind when thinking of the “worst RS Criminals” which are pretty much account stealers and botters, then selling the outcome with real life money. I have gotten this random threat from “Jagex” to my old e-mail (Yes, the usual <a href="mailto:legal@jagex.com">legal@jagex.com</a> ) These phishers are like those stealing chocolatebars compared to the best of the Real World Traders. I’m just waiting to see when Jagex turns the table and starts selling coins for real money! Bwahahaa!<br>
Seriously though, I’m utterly sure they’ve considered this as an option! XD</p>
