    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;NVIDIA ANNOUNCED AN x86 CPU – you know, those things that don&#39;t matter – yesterday at a Morgan Stanley conference. We told you so.
The pronouncement is at the end of the talk, you can hear it here. If anyone has a transcript, please post a link in the comments, we couldn&#39;t find one.
I wonder what the fanbois will say now? Who really cares? The important thing is what the Intel legal team will say when they get off the emergency 3am conference call they will be on in 3... 2... 1...
Given Nvidia&#39;s track record of compute correctness of late, I wouldn&#39;t want one of these to run my toaster much less a PC. That said, there is no truth to the rumor that they have the random number generator on it already up and running, unfortunately it is in the multiplier block. That is completely false, we are hearing it is triggered on divides, but can&#39;t 100 per cent confirm that.
In any case, the real question is whether or not Nvidia will survive long enough for this to see the light of day. We have our doubts. Given that it was anounced at an investor conference, it is likely a shallow attempt to prop up the stock. That just might work, until Intel decides to sic the flying monkeys... err, legal happy people on them.
Whatever the end result, years of hilarity is sure to ensue.
We don&#39;t like to say we told you so... but we did, from long before day one. (see here and here and here and here).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interesting.. Nvidia sure have the money and fans to support a new CPU manufacturer.</description>
