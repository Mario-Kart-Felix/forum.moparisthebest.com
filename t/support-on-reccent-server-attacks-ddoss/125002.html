        <p>Many of you have been panicking about your servers being attacked and so on and so forth. But few of you would know that I have great knowledge in IRC and when I was running an IRC network I dealt with bot attacks often. For those who have said these attackers have been using proxies they are correct about the proxie matter but you can stop these proxies from entering your server by installing BOPM.</p>
<p>What the fuck is BOPM you ask?</p>
<p>BOPM stands for Blitzed Open Proxy Monitor it is used for IRC servers to K-line (Server Ban) users who connect using insecure proxies. Now I have read that BOPM relys on reading from text information eg IRC chat. Now I personally don’t know how to modify BOPM but it’s possible, and you may have to recode your servers slighly to suit it but you could modify BOPM to scan RS2 and classic servers. All you need is a way for BOPM to read your runserver.bat or have it outprint IP’s to a screen which is monitored by BOPM.</p>
<p>Another solution relys on you searching the web for proxys and adding them to the IP banlist manually.<br>
Link to bopm: <a href="http://wiki.blitzed.org/BOPM" rel="nofollow noopener">http://wiki.blitzed.org/BOPM</a><br>
I have heard there are server patches availbale to fix these problems but this is a great alternative to stop ban evaders and DDos attacks.</p>
<p>I hope this helps anyone who needs the help. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>PS: If you set BOPM up correctley you can even get it to go out to DNSBL sites. (Servers/sites that keep updated with the latest proxies saves time scanning the client.)</p>

I doubt that most people who run a RS2 private server can integrate it correctly, because they just do it for fun and not for the programming experience.[/quote]BOPM isn’t that hard to configure though but the only problem is how it will read the runeserver.bat<br>
EG:</p>
<p>User connecting on port 12345 from 124.567.8.90<br>
Mod Command used: op<br>
User connecting on port 12345 from 34.364.4635.4</p>
<p>Theres an example now BOPM will proberaly be able to read it but problem is it’s going to have trouble reading it because of other read outs the runeserver.bat does like the Mod Command used op: the scanner my scan op command when it should only scan the IP’s.</p>
<p>My idea is playing with BOPM is to set so when it sees the word user it will follow it to the last word which is the IP then get it to scan that word.<br>
…an idea just came to my head where you have the readout is a good idea to have a command line added because on IRC when BOPM detects it does the commands /Kline <em>!</em><span class="mention">@proxyhost.net</span> / IP Address. But if the proxy scanner cant scan faster then the user can conenct the client would still be able to connect to the RS server so they may already be banned but they need a kick to enforce the IP ban.</p>

<p>Someone with brains on the matter. XDDD!</p>
<p>Yes, that could work but the problem is that’s not how BOPM works.<br>
BOPM is a bot it sits there and it scans it doesn’t scan then forward the client it just scans and if a proxie makes it way through it kills it.</p>
<p>For full explanation.</p>
<p>ProxyBot connects to server.<br>
*** IRC user connects to the server at IP 123.4.5.6 ***<br>
(ProxyBot then scans the IP as soon as the bot reads the notice the client is connecting at this time the user is still allowed to connect and has not been blocked yet.)</p>
<p>The bot does the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connects back to the IP and does quick firewall check. &lt;— Proxybot determines if the user is conencting from its own IP or using a proxie. If detected it will ban the proxy.<br>
2)Checks active DNSBL lists to see if the IP has been detected as a proxy elsewhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the last to checks fail then the IP is real.<br>
If it detects anything it will then do the command.</p>
<p>/Kline  open proxy found please check the active DNSBL list at <br>
Then the IP is now banned from the server so no one can connect from the IP 123.4.5.6</p>
<p>The point is to remember while BOPM is scanning which the scans take miliseconds to complete the user is still allowed to connect. Basically inoccent til proven guilty.</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>BTW I posted this elsewhere on the board.</p>
<p>“Also DDos attacks are ILEGAL and there is a fine and jail setence for anyone caught doing it. Legally someone can contact there ISP and the police will have him tracked down. Yes he is using proxies but by law proxie servers must keep record of IP’s that have been using there service. So basically all this DDos attacks can stop if a victam decides to report it and provide them information explaining is a group or one person whos attacking the community.”</p>
