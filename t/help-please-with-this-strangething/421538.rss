              <p>Find your graphics card model and google for any new drivers, usually that fixes the problem.  If it is saying “is not working correctly” then it is most likely just the drivers.</p>
<p>It isn’t a hardware issue, you would have no screen at all if that was the case.</p>

              <p>I would talk with somebody you know who is good with computers or call geek squad to figure the problem out, once they figure it out -im pretty sure its your graphics card- you can just go buy the stuffs ^.^</p>
