    <description>Hello, I was wondering if anyone kind enough would help me with codeing. (npc&#39;s that actualy do somthing, interactable objects, monsters that fight back, other cool features, ect...) The only things I know how to do is how to spawn myself items, teleport, walk through walls and spawn useless npc&#39;s that just stand there and do nothing but die even if the hit count says &quot;0&quot;. So if you can help make neat custom shops and help to make a nice server with a growing community and a 24/7 server at least 98 % of the time then go to this IP address or contact me by this E-mail to guide me through this step by step

E-mail==  lord_white_0@yahoo.ca

IP=====  127.0.0.1

I don&#39;t think I have a hamchi thing or whatever it is so dont worry about that...unless me not having it is a bad thing.</description>
