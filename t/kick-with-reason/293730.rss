    <description>This is a 508 server |
--------------------



I am looking into making ::kick be with a reason, meaning...

When a person types ::kick it will look for the substring(playername) then look for substring(reason)
My friend told me I would have to make it into an index and make it search the index for spaces and after each space it will be (playername) (reason)

So, 
Would I just put all of the command into an index and make the server search the index for spaces and just figure out what the reason is.

Or is there a different way?</description>
