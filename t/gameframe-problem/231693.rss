    <title>Gameframe problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gameframe-problem/231693</link>
    <description>I was wondering which .java file would be the right one to edit exactly where the sprites are, like, say I add a 474 gameframe onto a client such as RicScape v8 client, it wont look correct, the sideicons would be off to the side, the redstones would be up too high, and wouldn&#39;t line up with the inventory, it&#39;s just a mess, so I need help.

Seriously, I have NO experience with clients, lol.</description>
