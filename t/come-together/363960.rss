    <title>Come together!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/come-together/363960</link>
    <description>Let us as part of the Moparscape community tell about who we are and what we do (anything job/collage/java script?)
I just want to see what the community is like here.
So please discuss :]


I will tell you about me now. :]

I am 16 years of age
I go to Waterloo Highschool, i am a junior
I am pretty smart, but don&#39;t really apply myself
I went through a period of depression when i was younger because of my perents divorce and months later my aunt had died of the age of 40 i have recently been cured of this and found that screwing with java helps keeps my mind off of things when i&#39;m pissed
I am not afraid to admit i have on the fat side. I&#39;m not [size=18pt]HUGE[/size] but i am a little chubby. :]
I have long hair and the natural hair color is brown
My eyes are a really light blue
I like Screamo, Rock, Old rock, anything along those lines

And that is  probably it lawl.

If you want to know anything else just comment.</description>

<p>I’m Tom,</p>
<p>I’m 15 years old, I’m from the United Kingdom, England. I hate pretty much every sport and will come up with as many excuses necessary to avoid participating in them. I’m not fat and no, I’m not some skinny nerd. I go to CLHS. I haven’t really been active on these forums for a while but I probably will be now. I don’t know why I have the name ‘TOMSCAPE BETA’ I was a bit thick when I made it, if I had a choice I would chose something much more sensible.</p>
<p>I really don’t care about rsps anymore and don’t even know what PI is. Savy? But I still do pop into the help section from time to time and contribute something back into the community, that is all.</p>

<p>I’m a 17 year old antisocial and cynical twat who sits around programming in Java and hanging out with people he sometimes arrogantly considers stupid because that’s what he’s done for the last three years.</p>
<p>Or, I was. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I’m a 17 year old who enjoys logic puzzles, hanging out with my awesome friends and girlfriend, and has nothing better to do but sit around and think about how good life is. I have less than half a year left of my childhood and I am making the most out of it. I am what some people could argue is <span class="bbcode-i">too</span> skinny, and I can’t gain a pound of fat more than I need if I tried.</p>
<p>I have moderated this site for a few years now, and am only back because I like working with the staff. I have generally given up on the RSPS scene, but I do like to work on side projects, partially related, from time to time.</p>
<p>I have watched around 400 episodes of miscellaneous TV shows over the last year and a half, including Heroes, House, Lie to Me, 24, White Collar, V, and more. I enjoy most music artists of rock, classic rock, and alternative. I like a few metal and heavy metal bands, too.</p>
<p>I think that’s enough information for now. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

My life consists of going college 4 days a week, basically doing nothing but listen to music all day and having a good chuckle with my pals, I then come home and spend about 4 hours with my girlfriend, practically everyday.<br>
After this, I then do the college work I was meant to do in college (find it easier to concentrate at home), put facebook on auto refresh and occasionally get distracted by moparscape, I eat tea, and go sleep.<br>
What a boring life I lead.</p>

<p>Hi I’m Charlie, I’m 17 in january.<br>
My life consists of going college 4 days a week, basically doing nothing but listen to music all day and having a good chuckle with my pals, I then come home and spend about 4 hours with my girlfriend, practically everyday.<br>
After this, I then do the college work I was meant to do in college (find it easier to concentrate at home), put facebook on auto refresh and occasionally get distracted by moparscape, I eat tea, and go sleep.<br>
What a boring life I lead.</p>
<p>Oh yea and any free time I get I do 3d modelling, currently designing a kitchen to look photorealistic to apply for a job at a local architectural CGI business.</p>
