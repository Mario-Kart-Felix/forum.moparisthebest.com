    <title>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/544423</link>
    <description>In honor of the next Star Wars movie coming out sometime within the next few years I decided to go back to my favorite childhood game, KOTOR 1 and 2. I pretty much just finished the first which according to my save file took me 36ish hours to complete over the span of a month or two. The game isn&#39;t as hard as I remembered :P it gave me a really good understanding of how force works in the star wars universe. Better than having to watch the stupid animated series. 

Anyone else play it as a child? Or maybe some of you gramps did in your teens?</description>

              <p>The fact that you start questioning the reasoning behind the Jedi order and morals between Light and Dark sides is kind of canon and does feel like Star Wars to me. It’s not too clear but it does show this with Luke and Anakin.</p>

              <p>The first one definitely feels “star warsy”, the second one explores the difference between light and dark and shows that the two can overlap, in most star wars media the difference between the light side and the dark side tends to be clear-cut so that might not feel very “star warsy” to you</p>

<p>I remember playing it many years ago and getting stuck in the underground, or whatever it’s called.

<p>You mustn’t have gotten too far into the game then. You don’t get a lightsaber until you get to the seconds planet in the game. The game is very Star Warsy. Even has a few references to a few canon Sith lords. Star wars is more than just the movies btw</p>

              <p>It kind of lost its appeal after I replayed it a lot of times … It’s really annoying to get to work properly on windows 7 or 8 and you have to hack it to get it working on a widescreen resolution which kind of blows <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>Also with the second one most of the game was pretty well done except for the final 10-ish percent of it which was really rushed</p>

              <p>i still play kotor from time to time, it’s a great game (i played it a bunch on xbox, a good couple hundred hours in replaying it and replaying it). i don’t care for the second one, it was rushed and a lot of stuff was incomplete, but i play it occasionally (it’s a bit better with the fan made content mod which restores unfinished material).</p>
