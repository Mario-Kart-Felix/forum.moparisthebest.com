    <description>[center][b][size=16pt][font=Batik Regular] MimzScape[/font] [/size][/b][/center]


[b]Hey wassup you guys! Well I&#39;m currently working on a new server (my first one) and it&#39;s called MimzScape (because of my last name of course) and I just decided to share what it is with you all in the hopes that someone might like it and possibly give some suggestions or something...[/b]

[b]Well I promise, I&#39;m not just talking out of my ass here when I say that this is going to be [u]one[/u] of the best servers available[/b]

[/center]


So... I just thought that I would tell you about my project and I don&#39;t have anyone to work with on it so I&#39;m going to be by myself, if only someone could help me with all of this shit (hint), I might give credits to that person and possibly make them an Admin (since there are no Co-Owners)... If only...

Well anyway, for more information about my upcoming server you can go to [url=http://mimzscape.smfforfree3.com/]http://mimzscape.smfforfree3.com/[/url] and sign in and we can talk, I will also be adding information on these topics in the &quot;MimzScape Development&quot; section, So check that out.


(Extra Info)

* (More Organized) 
What I meant by more organized was that everything wouldn&#39;t be crushed together in a tiny home area and a fuck load of portals with annoying Npcs shouting &quot;Shop Portal&quot;, &quot;Minigame Portal&quot;, and all that other bullshit. It&#39;s not going to be confusing

** (More Minigames) 
This means what you think it means... more minigames, the reason I put this in the extra information section was to tell you the different types of minigames...

[u]Clan Wars[/u] 
A player has the option to join a clan with his friends and enter a designated portal for their clan... When they do this they then must find members from the other clans and kill them. Once they have done this, they must obtain the players ring and cape that they are given at the start of the game. Once they do this, they then have to exit through the Clan Wars exit portal with their cape in their inventory. Then they go to the Clan Wars chest and get 10k and +5 points for their clan (also when they kill another clan member they get +1 points for their clan)

[u]Hell Wars[/u]
A player goes into the depths of &quot;Hell&quot; and must battle his way through the levels of &quot;Hell&quot; to reach the most valued item of the Underworld... The Unholy Book, then once the player has returned with the book, they give it to Evil Dave and he gives you Soul Points (Soul Points are then used to buy Holy or Unholy items)

[u]Fight Arena[/u]
I&#39;m sure most of you know what this is, so I&#39;m not going to explain it

[u]Hand of the Gods[/u]
A player is teleported to an empty grassland area that contains a few signifigant items with a task to perform. This task can be any number of things (I&#39;m still working on this... So this isn&#39;t a major Minigame right now...)

And basically all of the other Minigames just modified to look cleaner



***(Looking Nice)
This basically is what I said before about it being organized, but it also means that it&#39;s going to appeal to the eye. For example, you orginally had a place that looked dull and boring and how it had originally looked before, well now it looks &quot;pretty&quot; (lol, not meaning to be gay) and it means that I&#39;m going to take the original home area, minigame area, pking area, quest area, and give a &quot;makeover&quot; like one of those home makeover shows with less people that sound like complete fags and dress in tight jeans. 


****(Muliple Choice Npcs)
Mainly I&#39;m just going to explain what the multiple choice option is. Okay have you ever right clicked on an Npc and seen options such as &quot;Talk to&quot;, &quot;Buy&quot;, &quot;Bank&quot;, or &quot;Teleport&quot;? Well I&#39;m sure you have, so what I meant was that if one of those options is there i.e. &quot;Talk&quot;, &quot;Bank&quot;, Teleport&quot;, They are going to work. So if you see Aubry and you right click him and choose the &quot;Teleport&quot; option, you&#39;ll teleport the Rune Essence mine. Or say you want to choose the &quot;Talk&quot; option, He&#39;ll talk to you. The same goes for [b]ALL[/b] Npcs that are in the server.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________



Well, That&#39;s about it...
I hope I don&#39;t have to do this alone (another hint)

So if you want to help me out you can visit my forum that I made for this project

most people that post downloads for 503’s and 508’s leech like a mother fucker or they don’t anywhere near as much stuff that the 474’s do… so no jordie is NOT in a minority because he is using what Silabsoft, Moparscape, and a lot of other private servers still use… Now eventually the 500’s will be the dominant servers but fo right now, I’d say that the 474’s are still in play</p>

No, it doesn’t. I prefer the below 474 graphics, they’re the best. 508+ are tacky.<br>
[/quote]<br>
The graphics are the same, this is low detail. And the 474 graphics look just like the 317 graphics:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://www.allgofree.org/rs/pics/474/474.jpg" title="474.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://www.allgofree.org/rs/pics/474/474.jpg" alt width="690" height="476"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>
<p>The only change in the 508 low detail is the characters, they gained some weight. And by how many people are on the new servers, it seems your in the minority right now.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>yeah…<br>
thanks for being a dick on my development thread… I really appreciate it faggot<br>
well anyway…<br>
anyone want to help me?<br>
please</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Flaming and begging won’t help. Why not start a 508 development thread or something productive? I’m not stopping you from doing anything. You can still do this if you want too. It doesn’t really matter to me.[/quote]<br>
That’s why i said i prefer 474 and below graphics.</p>

<p>The graphics are the same, this is low detail. And the 474 graphics look just like the 317 graphics:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://www.allgofree.org/rs/pics/474/474.jpg" title="474.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://www.allgofree.org/rs/pics/474/474.jpg" alt width="690" height="476"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>
<p>The only change in the 508 low detail is the characters, they gained some weight. And by how many people are on the new servers, it seems your in the minority right now.</p>

thanks for being a dick on my development thread… I really appreciate it faggot<br>
well anyway…<br>
anyone want to help me?<br>
please[/quote]<br>
Flaming and begging won’t help. Why not start a 508 development thread or something productive? I’m not stopping you from doing anything. You can still do this if you want too. It doesn’t really matter to me.</p>

[/center]</p>
<p>So… I just thought that I would tell you about my project and I don’t have anyone to work with on it so I’m going to be by myself, if only someone could help me with all of this shit (hint), I might give credits to that person and possibly make them an Admin (since there are no Co-Owners)… If only…</p>
<p>Well anyway, for more information about my upcoming server you can go to <a href="http://mimzscape.smfforfree3.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://mimzscape.smfforfree3.com/</a> and sign in and we can talk, I will also be adding information on these topics in the “MimzScape Development” section, So check that out.</p>
<p>(Extra Info)</p>
<ul>
<li>(More Organized)<br>
What I meant by more organized was that everything wouldn’t be crushed together in a tiny home area and a fuck load of portals with annoying Npcs shouting “Shop Portal”, “Minigame Portal”, and all that other bullshit. It’s not going to be confusing</li>
</ul>
<p>** (More Minigames)<br>
This means what you think it means… more minigames, the reason I put this in the extra information section was to tell you the different types of minigames…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Clan Wars</span><br>
A player has the option to join a clan with his friends and enter a designated portal for their clan… When they do this they then must find members from the other clans and kill them. Once they have done this, they must obtain the players ring and cape that they are given at the start of the game. Once they do this, they then have to exit through the Clan Wars exit portal with their cape in their inventory. Then they go to the Clan Wars chest and get 10k and +5 points for their clan (also when they kill another clan member they get +1 points for their clan)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Hell Wars</span><br>
A player goes into the depths of “Hell” and must battle his way through the levels of “Hell” to reach the most valued item of the Underworld… The Unholy Book, then once the player has returned with the book, they give it to Evil Dave and he gives you Soul Points (Soul Points are then used to buy Holy or Unholy items)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Fight Arena</span><br>
I’m sure most of you know what this is, so I’m not going to explain it</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Hand of the Gods</span><br>
A player is teleported to an empty grassland area that contains a few signifigant items with a task to perform. This task can be any number of things (I’m still working on this… So this isn’t a major Minigame right now…)</p>
<p>And basically all of the other Minigames just modified to look cleaner</p>
<p>***(Looking Nice)<br>
This basically is what I said before about it being organized, but it also means that it’s going to appeal to the eye. For example, you orginally had a place that looked dull and boring and how it had originally looked before, well now it looks “pretty” (lol, not meaning to be gay) and it means that I’m going to take the original home area, minigame area, pking area, quest area, and give a “makeover” like one of those home makeover shows with less people that sound like complete fags and dress in tight jeans.</p>
<p>****(Muliple Choice Npcs)<br>
Mainly I’m just going to explain what the multiple choice option is. Okay have you ever right clicked on an Npc and seen options such as “Talk to”, “Buy”, “Bank”, or “Teleport”? Well I’m sure you have, so what I meant was that if one of those options is there i.e. “Talk”, “Bank”, Teleport", They are going to work. So if you see Aubry and you right click him and choose the “Teleport” option, you’ll teleport the Rune Essence mine. Or say you want to choose the “Talk” option, He’ll talk to you. The same goes for <span class="bbcode-b">ALL</span> Npcs that are in the server.</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, That’s about it…<br>
I hope I don’t have to do this alone (another hint)</p>
<p>So if you want to help me out you can visit my forum that I made for this project<br>
