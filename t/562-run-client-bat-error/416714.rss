    <description>[s]Hello i just switched to a 562 to check it out, but when i try to run the client i get a error saying java is not a command or xm250 is not rite. 
i have tried switching to &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0\bin\javac&quot; which works on other servers but i still get messed up errors. how do i get it to work? if you can post what is inside of your run client.bat filethen that would be great![/s]
