    <title>Shard Master Classic - WIP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shard-master-classic-wip/553958</link>
    <description>
Heavily inspired by RuneScape Classic, Shard Master Classic is a game that I hope to actually &quot;finish.&quot;


Written on top of my engine, Envel II, this game offers graphical capabilities that RuneScape Classic could not offer at its time such as shadows, textured landscape, perspective correct texture mapping, slightly higher resolution, and 3D walls.


There is no click-move style of gameplay in Shard Master Classic, movement is done with WSAD.

Items / Inventory
Fixed collision
World interaction
Item dropping
Memory usage cut down and game runs faster due to graphical cutbacks :p

I read all the comments. Some of you guys need to shut up and let this guy carry on with his work. If you don’t like it then tough. Go on a different thread. This guy is working on something different and he likes what he is doing. The knowledge he posses right now is helping him create this pile trash. (Joking!)</p>
<p>I personally like it. Basic yet it has more room for work and the fact that it looks very simple really makes me happy (idk why)</p>
<p>I’m just saying if you don’t like his work then go on a different thread. The community here is just bad, even if you are giving him advice on how to/where to improve. You guys were abusing his work.</p>
<p>Limits try as hard as you can. At the end of the day what counts is what you prefer. If you like it then go ahead. As long as you put your mind and heart towards it you will achieve what you want.</p>

<p>I pissed my pants reading this. Half of it was saying how bad his game engine is or how he ripped his codes lol.</p>
<p>Edit: Love your comment by the way but I didn’t do anything bad. The community here is bad… All I did was told him to concentrate on his work. No need to get angry</p>
