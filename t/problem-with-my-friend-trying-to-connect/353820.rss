    <title>Problem with my friend trying to connect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-my-friend-trying-to-connect/353820</link>
    <description>I opened my 508 source, and my friend ran the client, it asked for his hamachi ip he put my ip in, than it started to load, but the loading stops at &quot;connecting to updates&quot; even when he tries to reopen the client, it does the same thing.
Idk if this has anything to do with it, but when he clicks compile, it says &quot;cannot find path specified&quot; Press any key to continue... :confused:</description>

              <p>He has to open the compiler by right clicking and hitting edit. Then he needs to put the path to his latest java. If he has java 6 update 21 it may look like this:<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_21\bin\javac.exe” -cp . *.java</p>
