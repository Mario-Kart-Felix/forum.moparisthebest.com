    <title>Help with global objects</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-global-objects/291582</link>
    <description>Ok, So I cannot figure out how to delete/create global objects. I want you to let me know if this is set up correctly. If it is, tell me why it is not working. If not, Tell me what to do to make it right.

[code]makeGlobalObject(3241, 9362, 11758, -1, 10);//bank booth[/code]

I do that code then, save, compile, and run my server. nothing.. The object does not appear.

[code]deletethatobject(2785, 3175); //plant[/code]

I tried it, It doesn&#39;t delete objects. 

Someone help. By the way, I am using the Allstar-scape source.</description>
