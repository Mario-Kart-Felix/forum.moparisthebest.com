    <title>Multiplayer 2d Game?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/multiplayer-2d-game/292899</link>
    <description>[b]Info:[/b]
For the past few days I&#39;ve been trying to make my own 2d Game.
I&#39;m using pokemon images because they seem realllyy easy to work with. So I guess I&#39;ll stick to the Pokemon theme.
Anyways my goal is to make it multiplayer witch I have no clue how to do.

[b]Problem:[/b]
Ok I have succesfully made my client and server, but their obviously not complete.
I need to know how to add a packet system and how to add multiple players in a region.

[b]Questions:[/b]
How to I make it multiplayer or render multiple players in a region? [b]&lt;-- BIGGY need help[/b]
How do you add input boxes on the client with out using JTextArea?
How do I add a title system to walking?

[b]I have noticed the thread below me. Its similar to what I&#39;m doing.[/b]</description>

<p>If you take it upon yourself to continue the project, here is an answer to this question:</p>
<p>[quote=“openice123, post:11, topic:292899”]Idk how to do anything else from now.<br>
Like packets and making multiple players show up in the same map.[/quote]<br>
Basically, upon a new client connection, after the login handshake(s) have been fulfilled, the server sends a packet similar to the one Lin posted. This packet contains all of the players that are within the current region (in other words, the players that are drawable) along with their characteristics. The client will have an array of “Player” objects, and will add each one according to the packet’s specifications. Then, in your drawing method, you will iterate through the player array and draw the players one-by-one according to their location on the screen and map.</p>
<p>Each time a player walks, the client will send the respective walk packet to the server, the server determines which players are within the region and sends the packet to them. The client will proceed to read the packet, identify the moved player and changed its location.</p>

Lin, RS sends the packetLen before the ID. It’s either 1 byte or 2 bytes, depending on the packet size. This does as Taharok mentioned, mark the end of the packet (well it doesn’t, it tells you how many bytes to read, but it as good as does the same thing). I think the way RS reads/writes packets may be a little complicated for openice123, for bandwidth issues, the packetLength is only 2 bytes when it HAS to be 2 bytes, determining this for both reading and writing is relatively simple, but perhaps confusing for openice123. I think he could/should do a similar protocol, but always send 2bytes for the length, this way hes guaranteed to have enough packetLength should he have quite a few players on, its highly unlikely he would suffer from the bandwidth/latency issues RS would have and its much simpler than formatting and determining the format of the packets like RS does.</p>
<p>(WORD (or java short))length // (byte)opcode // [optional]operands</p>

<p>Only for static packets. For dynamic packets, you need to either store the size with it or have some sort of end-of-packet marker. This marker would also have to be on static packets, unless dynamic packets have special identifiers that differ from static packets. But that just complicates things in my opinion.</p>

<p>Where 2 is the length, 56 is the opcode (maybe the code for “Attack”) and 79 is an operand (maybe the players index i.e. 79).<br>
Obviously, this small example has limitations, the fact that the length may not exceed 255 bytes, nor may the opcode be larger than the byte 255. If you think this will cover your needs then by all means go for it. Another approach could be the following:</p>
<p>length (2 bytes), opcode (2bytes), operands</p>
<p>This is pretty similar to before, only this time you are going to have 2 val for length/opcode this allows your length to be up to 65535. And opcodes up to 65535. (Providing you read into an unsigned short)<br>
(Clearly each packet you send like this will be an additional 2 bytes, so it may effect performance).<br>
As far as im aware, RSC atleast had no more than 255 opcodes and manipulated the raw data to see if the length of the next packet was 1 or 2 bytes. I guess they did this for optimization.</p>
<p>Anyway, gives you something to think about I guess.</p>

<p>Packet sizes tells the byte reader the length to read.</p>

              <p>By the sound of it, you are creating a new connection for each packet. Don’t do that. All you need is 1 Socket instance during the duration of the login.</p>
<p>And as for your alternating feet, that’s not too difficult. You need 2 sprites which have the alternating feet (assuming you already do), then you draw 1 for a few hundred milliseconds, then you draw the other. You just toggle between the two as you are walking, and it will display as a walking animation.</p>

<p>The loading of the images should be. Not sure what you mean.</p>
<p>A packet system. You could do it like how RS does it (By writing to a buffer and then sending that buffer to the server or to the client)</p>
<p>What do you mean by how login should be done?</p>
<p>Input boxes on the client can be achieved by implementing the KeyListener class. Then, when a key is pressed, you can make a string add the char pressed.</p>
