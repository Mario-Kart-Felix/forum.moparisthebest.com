              <p>Well, I didn’t post that to show you how to change the stock. I posted that to show you how to add more items, as that’s your problem, isn’t it? Just make another set and follow as I explained, Item Amount Item Amount. And you have to tab between them too.</p>

<li>You can’t rep.</li>

<p>Your Problem: It goes Item Amount Item Amount. Like this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">1048	100	1050	100</code></pre>
<p>1048 is the partyhat and the 100 is the amount of partyhats in the shop. Same goes for 1050. Also, don’t forget that you need to use tabs and not spaces if you didn’t already know that. This may not even help your problem, but tell me if it does…</p>
