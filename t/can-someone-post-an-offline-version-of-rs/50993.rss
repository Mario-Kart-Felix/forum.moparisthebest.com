    <title>Can someone post an OFFLINE version of RS?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-post-an-offline-version-of-rs/50993</link>
    <description>See, I have 2 computers, one at my mom&#39;s, and one at my dads. I&#39;m at my mom&#39;s most often, but she doesn&#39;t have the internet...But I really like modding RS. If its not impossible, could someone be very helpful and post a link to an offline RS?</description>

<p>If so you must download a server on your computer then export it to a flash drive or usb drive. After that remove the drive and plug it into another computer.</p>
