First, if you’re using PI…<br>
Then CTRL + F Server<br>
and if you see something that you searched Server = “”<br>
And has two quotations, that means it’s empty and you should type in your IP.<br>
If not, and you leeched (or downloaded) someone elses client they probably set it as ‘localhost’ or ‘127.0.0.1’ so search for those.<br>
Best of luck![/quote]</p>
<p>some are also set to 0.0.0.0 which is localhost too</p>
