-You have been hired by an educational company to create computer program in Java for specific subject areas. 
The company has offered its employees a bonus incentive for original program development menus. 
The company requires you to create a page menu containing at least three different subject menu items. 
Each item must represent different subject area content.
Examples:
Math – money investment calculations
-   using Cosine law calculating the angle of a triangle
Physics – calculating velocity and acceleration
-   calculating potential difference
-   using Ohm’s law 
Biology - health assessment based on the number of white blood cell count.
 Arts – evaluating the popularity of an exhibit based on the number of visitors coming to a gallery.

The program is expected to be interactive where the user enters chosen values to be used.</description>
