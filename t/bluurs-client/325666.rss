    <title>Bluur&#39;s Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bluurs-client/325666</link>
    <description>I just recently downloaded PvP-Corruption from R00n-Serba and they said to follow a certain tutorial to allow Bluur&#39;s Client to work with it, but the tutorial was removed. So, can anyone tell me what to do to allow it to connect? When I try to login, it loads, but then it logs out real quick, and then says &#39;Error connecting to server.&#39; Any help is greatly appreciated, will rep.</description>
