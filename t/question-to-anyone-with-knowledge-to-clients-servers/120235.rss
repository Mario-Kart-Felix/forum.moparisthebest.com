    <title>Question to anyone with knowledge to clients &amp;&amp; servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-to-anyone-with-knowledge-to-clients-servers/120235</link>
    <description>How exactly do you create a server based off the current client you&#39;re using? I really don&#39;t get it. I want to give this a shot, but I need a little further knowledge before I can proceed. Does it have to do with packets? I want to help this community to my best ability.

Can someone supply me with more information please? It would be very helpful.
                                  Thanks in advance.</description>
