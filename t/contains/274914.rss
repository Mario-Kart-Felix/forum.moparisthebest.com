    <description>Hai,
I&#39;m pretty sure all of you know about the &#39;EqualsIgnoreCase&#39; Thing.
Does anyone know how to make it so it &#39;contains&#39; Because I&#39;m working on an auto responding type thing.
So if someone says the word &quot;rules&quot; It opens up the help menu, Or a simple sendmessage.

Example :
&quot;Hey Does anyone know how to get to the [b] rules[/b] ?&quot;
Since he said &quot;rules&quot; Or another part of that sentence, Because if I do EqualsIgnoreCase, It&#39;s only a one word thing, And if i put a whole sentence, I couldn&#39;t possibly know what they are going to say,
Example, If I say &quot;Hay wut r the roolz?!&quot;
When my thing is
&quot;Hey What are the rules?&quot;.
If you guys have an awnser, Please post.

Kthnxbai.</description>

              <p>Make sure java.lang.string is imported and you can use the Java Method: contains.</p>
<p>something like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">String str1 = "hahawutlol";
String str2 = "wut";

if (str1.contains(str2)) {
System.out.println(str2+" was found inside of "+str1);
}</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunatly, the contains method is case sensitive, however, you can avoid this problem with something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (str1.toLowerCase().contains(str2.toLowerCase())) {</code></pre>
<p>Good luck in whatever you are doing.</p>
