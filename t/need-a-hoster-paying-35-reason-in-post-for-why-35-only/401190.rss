    <description>Need a Hoster, Paying 35% (reason in post for why 35 only)
The server HAS HAS HAS to be 24/7
The server HAS HAS HAS to be 24/7
The server HAS HAS HAS to be 24/7
The server HAS HAS HAS to be 24/7


I cannot host, because I have a different advanced router (rogers +) and it won&#39;t let me portforward 

~~ [u][b]YOU DO NOT NEED ANY CODING SKILLS TO HOST THE SERVER[/b][/u], YOU JUST NEED TO BE PORTFORWARDED. ~~

Hey there, some of you may have heard of Goudont 317 V1, and some of you haven&#39;t. Don&#39;t bother looking for the source cuz I have not released it yet. . I have been working on Goudont V2! This time with proper items not those crappy custom items (dragon platebody fucked up) (no no no offense to those who use the source and client that uses those custom items) 

Need a hoster, will pay 35% of the cash I get on the server. I am willing to pay 35% of the donations I get on the server, so imagine, IF for example, I get like $200, in total, I will pay you $70, by the end of the month. I am going to pay 35% to you because I need the other bit for the server website, buying VPS, so you don&#39;t have to be wasting your valuable time, and to be honest, I do not want to lie: I want to use 5% of the cash for my self. I guarantee you I am a very good dealer. Now read this carefully: I will pay ONLY at the end of the month, because of the fact some people (probably not you) just take the money and dip. So because of that, I will pay at the end of the month. IF, I repeat. IF, I get no donations on the server, do not worry if you don&#39;t get paid. The next month, I will pay you double the money I owe you. If you have any questions ask [b]goudont@hotmail.com[/b]. 
I do not have a VPS atm, cause I have no money on me RIGHT NOW, but When I get some money, I WILL get a VPS and give you your payment at the end of the month. I will get a VPS when I have enough. You can host for as long as you want, like a month, or a year! when ever you feel like you have to quit, you can tell me, and I will look for another hoster. Other then that, I will get VPS .

and I also was working on dungeoneering, and adding my own skill customly. skills done 

P.S---- the server HAS HAS [u][b]HAS to be 24/7[/b][/u]

P.P.S

Hosters MAY NOT post ANY content from the server they are hosting unless this has been confirmed by the owner.
ALSO, you cannot edit any parts of the source unless you have my permission.</description>

              <p>lol only 35%? Hosters waste money running the server, they deserve 50% for the hosting costs &amp; service cost, just because you wanna use the rest on a VPS doesn’t mean its any less money to host a server, besides the odds of a new server making 200$ in a month is very low so they probably won’t be paid. Just saying.</p>
<p>Goodluck though.</p>
