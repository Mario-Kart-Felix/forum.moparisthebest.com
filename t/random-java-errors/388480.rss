    <description>When ever I import A Runescape Private Server into Eclipse it always ses the server/client has 1000s of errors(indicated by the red X&#39;s).

However I know something is wrong since normally compiling its absolutely perfect with no errors. I have no idea why this happens and Ive actually been messing with it for a few days now but it seems its all rooted from unresolved imports which is ridiculous since all the necessary files/packages are there and like I said normally compiling and running outside of Eclipse runs perfectly/compiles with 0 errors.</description>

<p>An unresolved import is when Java is saying “Hey I don’t see where your getting this code from”</p>
<p>Im not going to write 2860 errors out.</p>
