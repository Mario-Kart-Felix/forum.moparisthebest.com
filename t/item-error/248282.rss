    <description>Ok when I run my server I get an error. I know it was because I was messin aournd and trying to change how much it was worth, but it didn&#39;t work. What I have done so far is delete it then retype it, but t still isn&#39;t working. Can someone help me with this. Also can someone explain how to change how much the item is worth. I tride and failed, so I am gonna ask someone lol.

[code]item = 1037	Bunny_ears	A_rabbit-like_adornment.	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0[/code]
