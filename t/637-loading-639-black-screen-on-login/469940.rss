    <title>637 loading 639 Black Screen on Login</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/637-loading-639-black-screen-on-login/469940</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m here to ask for some help from fellow coders here on Moparscape.

My friend Orel runs a server called MunityPK, and we&#39;re having some difficulties on Login.

When you enter your username and password, then click login, the client screen immediately goes black. I told him I would try and find some help, and if anyone could please be kind enough to help that would be great. We think it&#39;s the way the login is coded, but if it might be anything else, please let me know.

Thank you.</description>
