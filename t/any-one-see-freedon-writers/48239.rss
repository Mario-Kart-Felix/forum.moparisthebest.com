              <p>I am beginning to believe that most movie scripts are generated from a template the studios share amongst themselves.</p>
<p>Here’s the plot, though I’ve only seen commercials:</p>
<p>The enlightened white person (EWP) arrives to teach the frustrated, ghetto youth (FGY), who have been sucked into a cycle of violence and despair. EWP is bewildered, surprised to find that the FGY are not entirely retarded – if only they’d stop killing each other! FGY learn to trust the benevolence of the EWP, as she fights against a school system run by less-than-EWPeople. Violence, crime, maybe one of the kids dies, so we can be reminded that the EWP is the only hope of these poor, ignorant FGY. EWP cries with them. FGY are cemented in their resolve to overcome their surroundings and become wealthy and successful like the TV tells them to.</p>
<p>Story concludes with FGY having found said hope, and with the encouragement of the EWP, they now have a shot for a decent future!</p>
<p>Thank God for Enlightened White People always arriving to save the day. And just in the nick of time.</p>
<p>meh.</p>
