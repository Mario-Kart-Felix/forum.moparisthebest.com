    <title>[Hyperion] Revision #508!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hyperion-revision-508/388376</link>
    <description>[b][u]Hyperion #508 information![/u][/b]
Downloaded Hyperion and converted it to 508, lolwut.

[b][u]Credits[/u][/b]

[ul][li]Graham &lt;3 - For Hyperion; the greatest base ever released.[/li]
[li]Scu11 &lt;3 - obvious reasons are obvious.[/li]
[li]Mystic Flow&#39; &lt;3 - Trololol[/li][/ul]


[b][u][i]Features![/i][/u][/b]

[ul][li]All the features that were built into the original Hyperion release..[/li]
[li]Grahams event manager[/li]
[li]Full, 100% completed #508 cache data[/li]
[li]Friends and Ignore list.[/li]
[li]NPC rendering.[/li]
[li]Multiplater, multiplayer chat, multiplater combat, etc..[/li][/ul]


[b][i][u]Additional information[/u][/i][/b]
Hyperion #508 is a huge project. It will indeed be released to the community, as the people of these forums need a GOOD server in the download(s) section. Anyways, this is not something that will be done in just a few days. I need an incentive to finishing the server, so if you support be sure to add a little message showing you support, when you comment.

Regards,
 Drew.

[b]--We have encountered many updates; please refer below, to read up on all the NEW features..--[/b]
No need to be alarmed! The base has not been changed. After spending 3 horrific hours converting Hyperion into the #508 source, I realized it was not all I had planned it to be. My plan is to now, re-write every packet and add in Grahams event manager ASAP. I have finished most of the major core features in a framework, and I am quite satisfied with the results. Below, you can find a list of said features:

[ul][li]Character rendering &lt;3[/li]
[li]Item spawning, and equipment manager &lt;3[/li]
[li]NPC rendering &lt;3[/li]
[li]Login (hurr) &lt;3[/li]
[li]Multiplayer &lt;3 &lt;3[/li]
[li]Chat, and Private Chat![/li]
[li]Packets (skills tab, quest tab, etc..)[/li][/ul]

I spent about 6-hours coding these, and as stated before, I&#39;m more than satisfied with the results. I also removed a shit load of features pre-coded into Hyperion, as they were not created to my liking. I apologize to all those Hardcore Hyperion fans, I feel like the server could be made better without a shit load of common issues fixe(s) removed. I&#39;ve started working on a basic 508 IP changer. I&#39;ve packed only and all #508 data (no #503 shit..). Refer below for some pictures that I have recently taken. Below is an &quot;Update Log&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;-Update Log!-
*I&#39;ve added almost 100+ NPC&#39;s around the RS World.. Correct placements, as real Runescape.
*Started some Combat shit.. Starting at magic, than building up from there!
*NPC combat, and Player Vs. Player combat is completed!
*Eating is added.
*Different potions; completed!
*Added a lot of other small things for PVP.. Look for your self!
* Jewelry, and some commands, are used for an alternative to spawning a shit load of portals..&lt;/blockquote&gt;

EDIT: TROLOLOL; I couldn&#39;t think of a message to put in the &quot;Message of the week&quot;, so I put a random one in.. The &quot;Holds 2,000 Players&quot;, has YET to be tested. Don&#39;t believe everything you read ;)</description>

<p>Nooo. If people want this blank, they will just have to delete everything I have added into the source. The release of this server, will NOT be coming with anything that you normally need to run a server. The users will need to use an IDE, and learn to get the look and feel of this server.

<p>im just saying if i downloded a hyperion server i would like to customize it not leech oh well this is moparscape so leeching is what they like to do[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, my friend Mike who was supposed to be helping me - irl friend - with the server, bailed out on me. So, I’m probably going to release the files I have coded especially for the server, and if people know how to cache convert, they can paste them into their own Hyperion <span class="hashtag">#508</span>, or another <span class="hashtag">#508</span> server. As I do now know much about the 500+ protocols, I feel as I am not the correct person who should be coding this. Ahh, I’ll sleep in the idea, and maybe will have an answer in the morning.</p>

<p>Aaah, no sir you are correct. I mis typed, I ment it to be packets, plural for all the packet(s)… So basically the simple fix:<br>

Hyperion <span class="hashtag">#508</span> is a huge project. It will indeed be released to the community, as the people of these forums need a GOOD server in the download(s) section. Anyways, this is not something that will be done in just a few days. I need an incentive to finishing the server, so if you support be sure to add a little message showing you support, when you comment.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Drew.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">–We have encountered many updates; please refer below, to read up on all the NEW features…–</span><br>
No need to be alarmed! The base has not been changed. After spending 3 horrific hours converting Hyperion into the <span class="hashtag">#508</span> source, I realized it was not all I had planned it to be. My plan is to now, re-write every packet and add in Grahams event manager ASAP. I have finished most of the major core features in a framework, and I am quite satisfied with the results. Below, you can find a list of said features:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Character rendering &lt;3[/li]<br>
[li]Item spawning, and equipment manager &lt;3[/li]<br>
[li]NPC rendering &lt;3[/li]<br>
[li]Login (hurr) &lt;3[/li]<br>
[li]Multiplayer &lt;3 &lt;3[/li]<br>
[li]Chat, and Private Chat![/li]<br>
[li]Packets (skills tab, quest tab, etc…)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>I spent about 6-hours coding these, and as stated before, I’m more than satisfied with the results. I also removed a shit load of features pre-coded into Hyperion, as they were not created to my liking. I apologize to all those Hardcore Hyperion fans, I feel like the server could be made better without a shit load of common issues fixe(s) removed. I’ve started working on a basic 508 IP changer. I’ve packed only and all <span class="hashtag">#508</span> data (no <span class="hashtag">#503</span> shit…). Refer below for some pictures that I have recently taken. Below is an “Update Log”.</p>
<blockquote>-Update Log!-
*I've added almost 100+ NPC's around the RS World.. Correct placements, as real Runescape.
*Started some Combat shit.. Starting at magic, than building up from there!
*NPC combat, and Player Vs. Player combat is completed!
*Eating is added.
*Different potions; completed!
*Added a lot of other small things for PVP.. Look for your self!
* Jewelry, and some commands, are used for an alternative to spawning a shit load of portals..</blockquote>

EDIT: TROLOLOL; I couldn’t think of a message to put in the “Message of the week”, so I put a random one in… The “Holds 2,000 Players”, has YET to be tested.
