    <title>Helps create Lists for things like Compile. Ex. Gen&#39;s file names to lists</title>

    <description>I made this program it is used to help you make a compiler and find the file.
    What the program does:
                                      creates lists of your  *.java, *.jar, *.cfg *.sql, *.class

Purpose: To help you create other Generators. Ex: Compiler.bat

Place the program in the Main dir of where you want the lists.
    The lists are made depending on the directory structure of where you placed it.
       Aforementioned sentence means any files that are in and within the directory of where you placed &quot;List_Gen.exe&quot; will be included in the lists.


Please feel free to scan. Anyone can do this by simply uploading or entering url into: [url=https://www.virustotal.com/en/]https://www.virustotal.com/en/[/url]
  I would myself but i&#39;m to tired to mess with something to prove that its safe.

So Scan all you want you will find nothing, if you do find something its a false positive. The only reason I made it .exe instead of .bat is because of the source code; I don&#39;t want it leeked.

I guess I cant upload .exe to this forum, as it has been disabled. So I uploaded to dropbox.

Below is the names of what the Generated files will be named in case you are wondering.</description>

It compiles your classes and creates jar files alongside it organised packages. I’m pretty sure other software does this too.<br>
