    <description>Ok, i was banned 4 years ago for trading with another stolen account. I appealed it saying sorry, etc. and it was denied. Today, i log in and have another appeal i can make. What should i say? should i say sorry again or tell them someone else had access to my account?



[code]We regret to inform you that this account has been banned due to password scamming &amp; gaining items via account hijacking.

Our detection systems show this account trading with at least one other account that was hijacked at the time of the trade.

We do not discuss our detection processes.

You have been deemed to be in complete control at the time of the incident.[/code]</description>
