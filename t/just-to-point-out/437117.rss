    <description>I Don&#39;t know if this is in the right area but, just to clear up with everyone 
The only server that is out is the 667/700 server. Anyone saying they are using 667/704 is full of it.
The client you guys have is the 667/700 client, it connects using the 667/700 Server Keys!

Sub Build 5 as you can see.

As of MatrixClientV5 its 667/700, The MatrixClientv6 would be 667/704.
Sub Build 5 is for the Matrix 667/700 Client.

I just wanted to clear this up with everyone who claims they have a 709... Yes, there are some out there who have figured it out. But, for all the posers show some proof?

I found this out with Ownster owner of a server while searching around the 667/700 client</description>

              <p>Lol.<br>
Only me and Alex (Lubricant) have 704.<br>
That’s because we have repacked the cache ourselves, + you guys are all still using the client with malicious code in it.<br>
