              <p>youâ€™d have to add a method that keeps track of when the user logs on, and then make a program (or possibly even in the method itself)<br>
that will check the file where the method writes the information, and then deletes it if the information is it right<br>
You could have the method write a 1 in the character file for active within a weak, and a 0 for not (though I think the timer number would be huge)<br>
Or have a yes and a no in the char file, it clear everyday, it say no until they logon</p>
