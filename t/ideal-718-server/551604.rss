    <title>Ideal 718 server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ideal-718-server/551604</link>
    <description>Theres lots of 718+ servers out there, meaning alot of competition, But they all seem the same to me with just diffrent home locations.

I was wondering what the community really likes?

Eg. Hard earned items, xp harder making high lvls more worth, coin having a strong value etc.

Id like all suggestions please im planning on starting a project so taking all advice.

THANK YOU.</description>

              <p>I don’t even understand why people think that 718 servers are fun? That is the time that RuneScape was just utter sh*t. Also there isn’t even that big of a playerbase for 718 revisions. Even though I hate revisions above 474, I have to be honest and say most people enjoy 503+ better for some reason.</p>
<p>My advice, don’t make a 718.</p>
