    <title>The Ultimate FrumBall Script</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-ultimate-frumball-script/129664</link>
    <description>PLEASE READ:
R0b0t1 originally made this script. I simply added an extra life gainer.

This script has sticky pad support and will easily get you around 5000 points. But now it can get you much further.
I added a section that checks how many lives are left. If you only have 1 life left it will type &quot;frumball&quot; Which gives you an extra life. Which can seriously help you out.
