<p>there are some problems, i didnt see the first ball until the ball count was 2, and the balls sometimes dont bounce off the paddle, it just slides down and becomes a miss &gt;.&gt; other than that, its good, also if its 1 ball every 20-30 secs howed you get to 891? :0 i would assume you made it like 1 second or something?</p>

</aside>
<p>Yea I made it every second in the second pic</p>
<p>I didn’t notice the ballcount messing up and I had a hard time getting the ball to bounce off the paddle</p>
<p>I’ll revise the src tomorrow and see if I can rewrite collision.    I’ve also noticed that if the ball hits the section of the wall behind the paddle it bounces</p>
