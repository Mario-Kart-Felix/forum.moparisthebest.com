    <description>This is all files needed for a 728 server, to be able to control everything, i.e. spawns, item bonuses, npc bonuses, npc hit rate.... this is what is missing from most 728 servers...

all .bat files go into the main server folder with the rest of the .bat also put bonuses folder here as well

the other folders, find the same folder name in your server and put there

All who made these, i just packaged them together... it answers a lot of unanswered 
questions.

&quot;how to change npc attack, how to change item bonuses i want to add p ring, how to spawn npcs so they keep spawning back after i kill them&quot;

and like i stated up above this is a snippet but if you need any help with understanding what to do then just ask
