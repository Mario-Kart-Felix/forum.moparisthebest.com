<p>I have been checked on my portforwarding. I thought I had done it correctly, but I didn’t so a guy fixed it for me and said it was correct. Then we made  a firewall exception for the port TCP/UDP 43594. So, technically, it should be online, right? Well that’s what I thought too. I don’t know what it is keeping  it.
