    <title>Dragon-History IP Problem</title>

    <description>[code]setserver(&quot;honorscape.no-ip.biz&quot;, &quot;43594&quot;);[/code]
[code]setserver(&quot;honorscape.no-ip.biz&quot;, &quot;43594&quot;);[/code]

I changed the ip&#39;s in Client.



[code]&quot;honorscape.no-ip.biz&quot;, &quot;honorscape.no-ip.biz&quot;, &quot;honorscape.no-ip.biz&quot;[/code]

And I also changed the ip&#39;s in EGUI.


When someone else tries to log into my server, it doesn&#39;t let them join. As I log in, it says Connecting to 127.0.0.1, 43594. Or something like that. But I do remember it connecting to the default IP instead of my no-ip. Please help. What am I supposed to do?</description>
