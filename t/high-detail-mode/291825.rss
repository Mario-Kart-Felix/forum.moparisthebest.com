    <title>High detail mode</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/high-detail-mode/291825</link>
    <description>Hello, I was wondering what the requirements were to connect to a server, with the client being in high detail mode. Everytime I try to log into my server with high detail, It does the initialize method(iirc), and then crashes. Is it one of those things like 508&#39;s where if the mode is high detail, it reads an extra byte and then continues normally, or am I missing something else?</description>

<p>When I connect to a server, that has high detail compatibility, and nothing more, it works fine. All it has is login, plater rendering, and walking. That right there tells you its not a client problem.</p>
<p>When I connect to that same server on low detail, it looks fine.</p>

<p>And if it were a client sided problem, then no matter what server I would connect to, it would have the same effect on all of them. Since in fact, High detail works on other servers I connect to, it is thus not a client problem, but a server problem.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Do i need to explain this? The server you are connecting to is showing an interface, npc, or object that the HD mode does not accept. Thus infact, being a client sided problem. I am not saying it isnt the server causing the problem. Its just a simple fact that its the client accepting the problem, not the server. Get used to it.</p>

THen yes, i agree with elijah101, you are the one on the shortbus. Never use a 508 analogy for a 317 server. First of all, there is no such thing as a HD 317 server, all we can do is load new textures. Second, the analogy you used explained NOTHING about your problem. The problem your having is within the client itself. Try getting a new client.[/quote]</p>

<p>Listen, I explained the problem well. If i start the client in low detail mode, it works fine. if i load it in high detail mode, it doesn’t load. it goes to about the initialize() method, and then crashes.</p>

              <p>Hello, I was wondering what the requirements were to connect to a server, with the client being in high detail mode. Everytime I try to log into my server with high detail, It does the initialize method(iirc), and then crashes. Is it one of those things like 508’s where if the mode is high detail, it reads an extra byte and then continues normally, or am I missing something else?</p>
