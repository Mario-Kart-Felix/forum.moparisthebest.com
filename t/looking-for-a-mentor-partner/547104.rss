    <title>Looking for a &quot;Mentor&quot;/Partner</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-mentor-partner/547104</link>
    <description>Hello mopar, I am currently here in search of someone who could either help out by helping my learn certain things or would just be willing to be a partner on a project as i learn along etc.

What i would like to start with:

- Clicking objects and bringing up dialogue with multiple options and making those options work and do different things.
- Learning how to work with the quest book a little bit, make them go from red/yellow/green as progress is completed
- Understanding dialogues a bit more with npcs and requiringments for things
- and some other odds and ends

And before anyone says &quot;tutorials&quot;.. yes i know there are a few, but i&#39;d rather learn alongside someone if they are willing to help me or would like to just work with me on some random messing around things.

Please let me know if you&#39;re interested, thanks</description>
