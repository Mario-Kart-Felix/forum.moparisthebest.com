    <title>Honest opinions on 07?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/honest-opinions-on-07/548335</link>
    <description>Hey guys, figured i&#39;d start a good quality discussion thread on a probably overly recycled question, but what are your guys&#39; opinion on 07 scape at this point in time?

My personal opinion is 50/50 to be honest. the /50 on the bad side comes mainly from lack of community, and other small things. Personally I would have liked to have seen classic varrock, along with the parchment chat box, and even the old game frame in general. I sorta hated at first starting from scratch but then realized that&#39;s the point to get that old feel back. How about you guys?</description>

<p>But I still enjoy RSPS, so I continue to do it until it dies or changes dramatially. It’s the next best thing and I don’t personally support Jagex anymore because they don’t support me.</p>

<p>You’re speaking for yourself, not all “old schoolers”. I think what most people seem to think is they want the game 100% exactly like it was in 2007, when in reality they’re no doubt happy with many of the updates and would most likely be complaining or pushing for new content if the game was the exact same. There was private servers back then so obviously people were already wanting to change the game, add new content etc. The updates are community driven and there’ll always be people bitching either way. What I’m saying is I’m sure there’s at least one update in OSRS that wasn’t in 2007 and you like it.</p>
<p>The game would be stale and the nostalgia would have worn of much earlier if no updates were released, the game will (and is) go in a different direction to RS3 and is a good thing.</p>

<p>I accept the fact they decided to make changes. But it is just turning into RS3 with old graphics.[/quote]</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say it’s turning into RS3 just 'cause it includes some features from later versions…</p>

I haven’t played it but followed a few YouTube videos for a while. I longed for old school to come back since the day it got taken away. Now it’s here it’s not old school. It has overloads and other things that I’m unfamiliar with which just puts me off.</p>

Those were all community driven updates. While I agree it doesn’t hit the nostalgia factor anymore, the community is taking the game in a direction they want[/quote]which is what we always wanted I guess, but I dislike playing it because of all the ‘customs’ they’ve added. Yeah, it’s community driven, but sometimes the community doesn’t know what it wants.</p>

              <p>Hey guys, figured i’d start a good quality discussion thread on a probably overly recycled question, but what are your guys’ opinion on 07 scape at this point in time?</p>
<p>My personal opinion is 50/50 to be honest. the /50 on the bad side comes mainly from lack of community, and other small things. Personally I would have liked to have seen classic varrock, along with the parchment chat box, and even the old game frame in general. I sorta hated at first starting from scratch but then realized that’s the point to get that old feel back. How about you guys?</p>
