              <p>well to start off this should be in the moparscape questions section but anyways. just tell your friedn the server IP i suppose.simple as that lol unless i misunderstood what your asking. and the wrong syntax error thin is because you are putting in too big of a number i think. because 0995 is the code for gp. so type this in exactly like this   ::pickup 0995 10000000<br>
that should give you 10m. just do that till you have enough.or you might b able to ad a few 0â€™s. hope that helps</p>
