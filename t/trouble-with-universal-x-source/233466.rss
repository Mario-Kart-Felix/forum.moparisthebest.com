    <title>Trouble with Universal X source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trouble-with-universal-x-source/233466</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using an edited version of the Universal - X source (which is great)

I&#39;ve added a lot of this server but one thing i can&#39;t fathom out is NPC yelling.. I look in NPCHandler.java and follow tutorials but they all seem to guarantee that your source already has some NPC yelling. I&#39;ve tried added the codemyself in the right section but after a compile i get no results :(

If anyone can help me out with the code or why it isn&#39;t working in this source that would help me a lot. I don&#39;t want to change sources :O</description>
