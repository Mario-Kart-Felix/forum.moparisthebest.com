    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/movie-game-anything-ratings-are-gay/168372</link>
    <description>I was thinking, say there is a PG 13 movie. I would understand if a 5 year old wouldn&#39;t be allowed to watch it, but think about it. If your birthday is 1 day away, and you are 12, and you wanna watch a PG 13 movie who is to say you can&#39;t? I think its a load of bullshit that people think that in a little amount of time someone is supposed to mature.
I think the maturity level of the person should determine what you can&#39;t and cannot do.</description>

I find it ironic how you can’t, for example, buy the Family Guy movie/seasons at most stores if you’re under 18, however it’s on public TV.<br>

That’s the parent’s choice to moderate what their kids are watching. They could be watching porn for all they know.[/quote]<br>

sad cuzz u can’t see a pg 13 movie? oh fucking well, you shoulda lied and said you were 13, they wouldn’t of known.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You won’t shut up will you? Im 17, i just cant watch R rated movies yet (need to be 18 in canada)[/quote]</p>
<p>Er, I live in Canada. And I’ve gone to see R rated movies since I was little. Sucks for you I guess.</p>
<p>Reminds me of the time Wal-Mart wouldn’t sell me San Andreas. Anyways I agree with you though. I understand that many of these ratings are just to protect children. But thats the parents job.</p>

              <p>[quote=“the fu superior, post:1, topic:168372”]I was thinking, say there is a PG 13 movie. I would understand if a 5 year old wouldn’t be allowed to watch it, but think about it. If your birthday is 1 day away, and you are 12, and you wanna watch a PG 13 movie who is to say you can’t? I think its a load of bullshit that people think that in a little amount of time someone is supposed to mature.<br>
I think the maturity level of the person should determine what you can’t and cannot do.[/quote]</p>
<p>Working out someones maturity level is so much hassle; an age limit is simple and easy and works (usually).</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess from this thread you got turned away from a film because you were too young? Am I right?</p>
