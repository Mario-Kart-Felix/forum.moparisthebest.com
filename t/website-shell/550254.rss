<p>OP posted a deface page that looked like it had been written in 1998 and had the code practice to go with it. Obviously showing he had no knowledge of website development or anything of the like so I called him out for not understanding the same system he’s trying to exploit and ultimately wasting others time and he removed it because he realised that he was in the wrong the whole time.</p>

Why bother, it’s clear from this you have no knowledge of anything website related. You have no web design sense, no sense of any kind of scripting. You’re coming off as one of those kids who go through a list of dorks and exploit some pakistani clothing store. It’s kinda embarrassing, to be honest.</p>
<p>Like there is legit no point in anyone who knows anything about website development and design helping you pick out the flaws in this because it’s not like it’s going to be used for anything good. There’s no point in releasing it because it’s a pile of silab.<br>

<p>Ruby, why don’t you shut your fudgeing mouth? I don’t do web design. So please keep your god damn mouth shut. Obviously I never post in web design because i don’t know it. Thank you for pointing out the obvious. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> fudge yourself, Im still learning bitch[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re learning by exploiting some little egyptian hair salons databases?</p>
<p>What gives you the right to exploit a database when it’s fucking guaranteed you’d make the same mistakes that their developer made because you’re just as fucking clueless. No I won’t shut my mouth. Do something productive rather than ruining others work and more than likely wasting a small businesses time.</p>
