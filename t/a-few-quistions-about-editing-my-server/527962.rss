    <title>A few quistions about editing my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-quistions-about-editing-my-server/527962</link>
    <description>hi everybody i have a problem and i can&#39;t for some reason find my commands.java file.
i have no commandspackethandler.java file niether. can anybody know wat file should i have to edit commands?
i&#39;m using OceanX source if it helps somehow. i don&#39;t really know the version of it cause it wasn&#39;t written but i know it some old version of rs2.

1 more question i have the run button near the map but i can&#39;t press it so if i want to make my charecter run i need to go to the in game settings button and press run in there.

last question is about maki myself owner or donator.
when i change the charecters rights to 3 it makes e a co-owner and not owner.
and wen i make it 4 it makes me a super player accept of donator.
what should i do?
thx to everybody who wil help..</description>

you will see something like this</p>

<p>then change:</p>

                }</code></p>
<p>change YourIngameNameHere to your ingame name[/quote]</p>
<p>yeah, thx bro.<br>
i found it at last.<br>
but still i have a problem with this.<br>
i changed “syme” to MyIngameName but still it says that i’m co-owner or super player or anything else depending on charecter rights.<br>
how do i change in the charecter rights or add to them that charecter rights of owner??<br>
thx a lot.<br>

thx a lot.</p>

              <p>To get the run to work you’d need to establish that area of the gameframe as a clickable button then create a statement (similar to the run button on the options menu) in order for it to turn run on.</p>
<p>To make yourself owner go into the character files and change your playerRights to 2 or 3 depending on the source.</p>
