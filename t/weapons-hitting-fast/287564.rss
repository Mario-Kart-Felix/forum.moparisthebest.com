    <description>Certain weapons keep hitting fast such as scimitars and dragon longsword. Is there a way to fix this problem? It seems like a glitch. when you logout and back in with certain weapons it happen. Can someone please help explain what might be the problem. The source is richscape 4.2. 

A list of weapons i have found are:
Iron Scimitar
Mithril Scimitar
Dragon Longsword



Thank you,
