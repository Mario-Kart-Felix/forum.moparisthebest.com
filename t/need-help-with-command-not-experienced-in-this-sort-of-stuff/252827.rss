If you are not experienced at Java, don’t attempt to make a god dam server. Go learn some Java before you try to make anything, start with small things and work your way up. You will go no where the way you are trying to accomplish things now, especially asking for things as easy as a command, and not even knowing you need a server to have a private <span class="bbcode-b">SEVER.</span></p>

<p>Most of the time, the pickup command is coded into the source, or it just works withought it being found for some strange reson.  For help, here is my pickup command.</p>
<p><code>	    if (command.startsWith("pickup") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 1) {
		        String[] args = command.split(" ");
	         if(args.length == 3) {
			int newItemID = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
			int newItemAmount = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);
			if (newItemID &lt;= 160000 &amp;&amp; newItemID &gt;= 0) {
				addItem(newItemID, newItemAmount);
			} else {
				sM("ITEM ID ERROR MESSAGE");
			}
		} else {
			sM("COMMAND ERROR MESSAGE");
		}
	    }
}</code></p>
<p>Though, I am using Deltascape so it might not work, but those are the basic specs of it.  You add it into the client.java in your source files, not your client files.  You can search for tutorials on how to add commands by using the search bar at the top of the page.</p>
