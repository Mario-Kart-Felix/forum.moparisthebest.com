    <title>Help replacing firewave icon with new spell? [pi]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-replacing-firewave-icon-with-new-spell-pi/443983</link>
    <description>because i have no idea how to just insert a new spell i was wondering how to replace fire wave with the storm of Armadyl spell.

I used Tom&#39;s cache editor and replaced the on and off version yet when i close and save and compile and such it doesn&#39;t change the icon. 

tried lins interface editor and for some reason it keeps saying

unhandled exception has occurred in your application. if you click Continue, the application will ignore this error and attempt to continue. If you click Quit, the application will close immediately.

index was outside the bounds of array.

any help would be appreciated. thanks</description>
