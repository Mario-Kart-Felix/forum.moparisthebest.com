Well, I was bored so I went on Game Maker. I already knew about what it could do, but not knowing what it could do was good. So, once you have Game Maker, open it. Click on the little Red Pacman at the top. Leave the name of the box the same till later. This is a create sprite box. Then, youll see a green box. Double click on it. You&#39;ll see something like paint. Either resize it (Transform &gt; Stretch) or keep it the way it is. If it&#39;s something like an MSN picture, Resize it so it&#39;s 150x150. Next, click on the complete filler, AKA, the paint can. Right click on the green box and make it white (Or whatever you want it to be). Then, goto the pencil. Draw little lines with it like crazy, and keep switching colors. If you use all the colors, by the end it can look like this (Usually)

Now, when you&#39;re finished with the colors you want, goto Image at the top. Click Blur. Usually keep the number 1-3, 3 For best. Click okay. Now, your image will look nice ;)

To get it to change colors (Like the rainbow one), goto Image again. Click Colorize and move the arrow around to what you want. Click Okay.

If you want text on it, follow this. Before you blur, Type something with the TT thing on the right. Type your name, or something you want in it. Then, to change the font size and type, goto Text and then Font. Choose the font on the left, the type (Bold, Regular, etc...), and then size. The size can go higher than what it&#39;s at, you just have to type it. Next, when you&#39;re finished, hit ok. If you want your name to be a little cooler than one color, take the pencil and draw on it with some colors. Next, blur it. It should be pretty nice.

Well, I hope I helped all of you who don&#39;t really know about photoshop or anything else. This is just a little way of getting good images. Enjoy!</description>
