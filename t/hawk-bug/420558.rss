    <description>Well I rolledback wake_rider like fully because he&#39;d been griefing my stuff at spawn for 99 but I never noticed, that was fine but for some reason some of the stuff he griefed hasn&#39;t come back even though it appeared on /hawk tool

Also, there was a bug (sort of) when doing this - it destroyed one off his chests and all his items went on the floor then disappeared then I went round to inspect ad they had all gone and another chest was there now I&#39;m just getting internal errors on stuff though he had griefed quite a lot

1) 200 torches (estimate)
2) an entire train station
3) cleared spawn and the underground of it

Roughly 2000 edits (probably less) that weren&#39;t including his house - so maybe it&#39;s due to the vast rollback it&#39;s done this? Even if this bug has broken his chest it&#39;s serves him right anyway.

PS if you try to undo it it says internal error while performing this action as well.</description>

              <p>Sorry for the late response my ISP completely cocked up the internet connection to my area, so I have been without internet for a few days.</p>
<p>I initially thought it may have been that BUT it only finished when I did the command again (lack of detail in above and so on) it’s like one command just couldn’t do the job. I’m not sure if there is some kind of block roll back limit (which I doubt).</p>
<p>I may seem a little of the ball recently I have about 12 exams one after the other if anyone has noticed.</p>
