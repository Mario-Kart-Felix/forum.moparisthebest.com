              <p>This has subtly annoyed me for years, I never bothered posting anything about it but I’m sure renaming the board is something that Tom or MITB would have no problem doing. Personally I think “RS Client Hacking” would do nicely. A ‘Private Server Client’ is just a modified RS client that connects to a server. “Private Server” doesn’t belong in this boards name IMO.</p>

              <p>Can we drop the “Private Server” part, at least. We already know what it’s for…</p>
<p>I feel like the section title confuses a few people new to the community.<br>
(Not many people seem to read descriptions, hell some ignore the titles and post where ever).</p>
