    <title>Problem with my comp</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-my-comp/293398</link>
    <description>Whenever I turn on my comp, it boots as usual, gets to GRUB, and when I choose either XP or Ubuntu, it will begin to start up, but then my PC will just shut itself down. This happens about 3 seconds after choosing the OS. A way to stop this happening is to boot in to Safe Mode on XP, and then I ran a program called RegCure. It did its scan and I always get these results (even after I fix them through the program):
COM/Active X - 12 errors
Path File reference - 11 errors

After the program has fixed the errors, I am then able to boot in to Ubuntu or XP no problem. However, as soon as I turn my PC off, and then come back and turn it on later, I get the same problem, and have to boot in to Safe Mode to stop it. 

The only things i&#39;ve installed recently are a torrent of The Sims 3 and PSP Video 9, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re anything to do with the problem. 

Does anyone have any ideas or any checks I can ran to help diagnose the problem?

<p>It could be a virus/malware. Torrents sometimes have these; try scanning it with <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Malwarebytes</a>. Make sure you go to the update tab and run it through the update process before scanning. If it doesn’t open, try renaming it to something else and see if that works (A sure sign there is something on your system trying to block it)[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ve scanned for malware, and had a few things, but all got removed. The torrent was from demonoid as well, and had lots of downloads.</p>
