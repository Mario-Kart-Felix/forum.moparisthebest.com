        <p>I (male) chatted with Johan (not his real name) for a few weeks before we finally decided to meet for our first date. Since he was nice enough to drive a long distance (about 3 hours) to meet me at my place, I thought I would be extra nice for him as well. Instead of taking a shower, I smoked some weed and did a douching (I wasn’t gonna let him drive 3 hours for nothing) and took a nice relaxing bath. But when I greeted him at the door, I was disappointed with his looks. He was shorter than me which I already knew. But he was also bald, not in a good way. But beauty is skin deep right? What he lacked in physicality, he made up in other ways – he owned a house with a racing strip nearby and he was really sweet towards me.</p>
<p>After a nice leisurely walk in a park, we rested on my bed with a glass of wine. Before I knew, we were making out. But I felt a discomfort in my lower stomach as he was pounding my ass as I was laying down on my stomach, which was my favorite position. He was big in size so I thought the discomfort would go away soon if I just put little more lube in there. Suddenly Paul stopped what he was doing and said, “Niall, look at this!” I noted his concern on his voice and turned my head quickly to see where he was pointing at. His genital area was all covered with chocolate water which extended to my thighs and ass and the mattress that touched them – all brown and wet. I was still hazy from the weed but it hit me that it was the douching water that was somehow retained in my body was finally expelled with all the contents.</p>
