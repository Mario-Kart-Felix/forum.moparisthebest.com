    <title>Multiple Players online/Players in combat = HP/Chat does NOT show</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/multiple-players-online-players-in-combat-hp-chat-does-not-show/257619</link>
    <description>Well, I have a problem. The HP and chat does NOT show if the player is IN COMBAT with an npc or another player, or if there is more than one player online. It is invisible. I get this when I use silab or mopar client, but not a client such as RichScape. I am using PvP Palace for my new server base. Is there anyway to have the HP visable using the [b]moparscape or silab client[/b]?

I can&#39;t really supply any code as I have no idea what loads the HP bar or chat; except the chat packet. If anyone has an idea on what methods you want me to post, feel free to ask! 

If anyone has had this problem or does know how to fix it...it would be greatly appreciated! :)</description>
