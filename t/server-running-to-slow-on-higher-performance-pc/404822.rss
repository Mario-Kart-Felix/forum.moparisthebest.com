    <title>Server running to slow on higher performance PC?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-running-to-slow-on-higher-performance-pc/404822</link>
    <description>I am running 474 server and I&#39;m not sure if this is a common problem or not but when I run it on my 64 bit Windows 7 PC it can take up to 3000ms just to process everything, but on my laptop that runs 32 bit Windows 7 with much lower hardware performance it runs perfectly fine well under 500ms. Is this common among 64 bit systems? Or is there common programs that interfere with the performance of private servers? Both systems have the newest JDK&#39;s and JRE&#39;s.</description>
