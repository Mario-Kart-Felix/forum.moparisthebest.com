<p>I really could care less what happened to Lebanon, their a bunch of fucking idiots for starting it with Israel. Israel has had to takethis from all the fucking Arabs for years and now they are kicking ass. Just as the yshould be. When you fuck with a country that is on the leading edge of weapons technology, you get your ass kicked, badly.</p>

<p>It was not Lebanon’s actions that lead to the bombing, it was hezbolah who kiddnapped two israelie soldiers which they would return if israel would give back israeli prisoners. Therefore israel started the war because they prisoned lebonese civilians and till this day they dont want to return them.</p>

        <p>The United States is the only country in the history of the world that has the power to take over the world but doesn’t.</p>
<p>Since some of you want to give land back to people that which held it a few hundreds of years ago. Perhaps should start with Lebanon which was a Christian country,<br>
Serbia, Somalia, or Philippines.  Islam spreads by the sword.  Christian use to spread by the sword but no longer does so.  It is time Islam advances a few hundred years or be stopped.  Show me where Muslims live in peace with other religions?  Everywhere in the globe they exist there is conflict. Appeasement has not worked for the last 30 years.  Peace thru victory.</p>
<p>I find it odd that liberal/socialist want it to spread but conservatives don’t.  The euro socialist import them to do low wage labor, these people then become part of the welfare state.  Then as their numbers grow they try to advance their religion into the law system.  When if you look at their values the conservatives share more values with the Muslims than liberals.  Euro now faces high unemployment especially in Germany, reduced work weeks, prostitution is now a forced job for women in some countries, GDP growth is recessionary in some countries.  The EU is destroying euro, they are trying to stamp out nationalism.</p>
<p>You have to understand the human race advances through competition, where would be today without Russia or china to compete with.  Threats motivate advancements.</p>
<p>China controls North Korea.<br>
The reason why the UN resolution passed against North Korea is only because the US threatened to re-arm Japan.  The Chinese don’t want to see a re-armed Japan, review history.</p>
<p>Everything is economics.<br>
Might makes right.</p>

        <p>[quote=“MujaheD, post:47, topic:3550”]*hundreds of years ago?<br>
hold on change that to 60 years.</p>
<p>*The lebonese government is majourity christian</p>
<p>*Let them compete but destroying villages and residential houses isnt right. Little children are burning, where is the competition anyway? What does lebanon have to fight with? its not a war its a massacre.[/quote]<br>
you sound like one that believes the death tolls on both side have to be equal.  If more Jews were dead you would be supporting their actions?<br>
They hide are in civilian population thus civilian population will hurt.</p>
<p>Isreal needs a high K:D ratio to win, just like the US does in every war.</p>
<p>lebanon is run by hamas.<br>
They havn’t lifted a finger to stop Hamas, or dis-armed them.<br>
64 muslim, 64 christian  - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon</a></p>
<p>theocracy:<br>
Lebanon’s judicial system is based on the Napoleonic Code. Juries are not used in trials. The Lebanese court system has three levels - courts of first instance, courts of appeal, and the court of cassation. There also is a system of religious courts having jurisdiction over personal status matters within their own communities, with rules on matters such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance. Lebanese law does not provide for Civil marriage (although it recognizes such marriages contracted abroad); efforts by former President Elias Hrawi to legalize civil marriage in the late 1990s floundered on objections mostly from Muslim clerics.</p>
<p>Hezbollah became a part of the Lebanese government following the 2005 elections but is at a crossroads regarding UNSCR 1559’s call for its militia to be dismantled. On November 21, 2005 Hezbollah launched an attack along the entire border with Israel, the heaviest in the five and a half years since Israel’s withdrawal. The barrage was supposed to provide tactical cover for an attempt by a squad of Hezbollah special forces to abduct Israeli troops in the Israeli side of the village of Al-Ghajar[51]. The attacked failed when an ambush by the IDF Paratroopers killed 4 Hezbollah members and scattered the rest[52]. The UN Security Council accused Hezbollah of initiating the hostilities[53]. On December 27, 2005 Katyusha rockets fired from Hezbollah territory smashed into houses in the Israeli village of Kiryat Shmona wounding three people[54]. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called on the Lebanese Government “to extend its control over all its territory, to exert its monopoly on the use of force, and to put an end to all such attacks”</p>
<p>The civilians are electing these terror groups to their governements.  In fact most of the civilian populations is behind Hamas, Hezbollah.</p>
<p>Clinton’s roadmap to peace only allowed them to build-up arms.  The UN is worthless.</p>
<p>What you don’t understand is the big pictures where russia and china are very big players.</p>

<p>Gorrilla warfare is the very hard defense.  Isreal has been thier for many days and has only gotten into one village. Thier hitting more resitance than thought.  They are firing rockets out of civilian structures.  Isreal told them to leave over a week ago.  They have dropped flyers with warning.</p>
<p>Have you seen the pictures out of beriut, i would think that many more would be dead judging by all the building damage.</p>
<p>ok what is a alternative plan?</p>
<p>Have UN come in? the un has been their for over 30 years.<br>
disarm hezbollah? the un has been assigned to do that for years.<br>
Lebanese government disarm hezbollah? they view hezbollah as a political party and wont act against it</p>
<p>Neither side has shown all their cards.</p>

<p>actualy i ment if the USA try takeing over the world they would need to go agaisnt one of the big powers who also have nuclear wepons… how would america function if all the big countrys went agaisnt it out of fear of being invaded next? china japan france germany russia and the uk all have nucler weapons and conventional forces how do you think the USA would be run by its government when its capital city is a big smokeing hole?</p>
<p>the USA has its hands full with irak at the moment so with the majour powers fighting it then it would last about 10 days?</p>
