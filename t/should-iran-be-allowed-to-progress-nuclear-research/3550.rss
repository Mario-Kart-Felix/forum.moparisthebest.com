<p>Um… Cause they threatened “Death to America” usually people who threat you country and have terrorist ties you wouldn’t want having nuclear weapons. I dunno. And btw America doesn’t have 99% of the worlds nukes, we have a few more than Russia and than the rest are divided among the free world.</p>

<p>Dont really blame Isreal for doing so (its their job, not the US’s though). When the head of a state calls for or is for the destruction of another state, they directly put themselves at risk of a pre emptive strike if they do something that could possible help them cause the destruction.</p>

<p>actualy i ment if the USA try takeing over the world they would need to go agaisnt one of the big powers who also have nuclear wepons… how would america function if all the big countrys went agaisnt it out of fear of being invaded next? china japan france germany russia and the uk all have nucler weapons and conventional forces how do you think the USA would be run by its government when its capital city is a big smokeing hole?</p>
<p>the USA has its hands full with irak at the moment so with the majour powers fighting it then it would last about 10 days?</p>

<p>Oh ok so it’s ok for Israel to go around destroying cities and entire villages with many people in them but one rocket fired at isreal that injures 4 people is an evil terrorist attack? Isreal has the capability to completely destroy hezbollah and hamas while palestine and lebanon are completely defenceless against israel. Your right, casualties dont have to be equal, If somone rapes your sister do you rape their sister? no. What isreal is doing is completely unneccesary.</p>

<p>Gorrilla warfare is the very hard defense.  Isreal has been thier for many days and has only gotten into one village. Thier hitting more resitance than thought.  They are firing rockets out of civilian structures.  Isreal told them to leave over a week ago.  They have dropped flyers with warning.</p>
<p>Have you seen the pictures out of beriut, i would think that many more would be dead judging by all the building damage.</p>
<p>ok what is a alternative plan?</p>
<p>Have UN come in? the un has been their for over 30 years.<br>
disarm hezbollah? the un has been assigned to do that for years.<br>
Lebanese government disarm hezbollah? they view hezbollah as a political party and wont act against it</p>
<p>Neither side has shown all their cards.</p>

hold on change that to 60 years.</p>
<p>*The lebonese government is majourity christian</p>
<p>*Let them compete but destroying villages and residential houses isnt right. Little children are burning, where is the competition anyway? What does lebanon have to fight with? its not a war its a massacre.[/quote]<br>
you sound like one that believes the death tolls on both side have to be equal.  If more Jews were dead you would be supporting their actions?<br>
They hide are in civilian population thus civilian population will hurt.</p>
<p>Isreal needs a high K:D ratio to win, just like the US does in every war.</p>
<p>lebanon is run by hamas.<br>
They havn’t lifted a finger to stop Hamas, or dis-armed them.<br>
64 muslim, 64 christian  - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon</a></p>
<p>theocracy:<br>
Lebanon’s judicial system is based on the Napoleonic Code. Juries are not used in trials. The Lebanese court system has three levels - courts of first instance, courts of appeal, and the court of cassation. There also is a system of religious courts having jurisdiction over personal status matters within their own communities, with rules on matters such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance. Lebanese law does not provide for Civil marriage (although it recognizes such marriages contracted abroad); efforts by former President Elias Hrawi to legalize civil marriage in the late 1990s floundered on objections mostly from Muslim clerics.</p>
<p>Hezbollah became a part of the Lebanese government following the 2005 elections but is at a crossroads regarding UNSCR 1559’s call for its militia to be dismantled. On November 21, 2005 Hezbollah launched an attack along the entire border with Israel, the heaviest in the five and a half years since Israel’s withdrawal. The barrage was supposed to provide tactical cover for an attempt by a squad of Hezbollah special forces to abduct Israeli troops in the Israeli side of the village of Al-Ghajar[51]. The attacked failed when an ambush by the IDF Paratroopers killed 4 Hezbollah members and scattered the rest[52]. The UN Security Council accused Hezbollah of initiating the hostilities[53]. On December 27, 2005 Katyusha rockets fired from Hezbollah territory smashed into houses in the Israeli village of Kiryat Shmona wounding three people[54]. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called on the Lebanese Government “to extend its control over all its territory, to exert its monopoly on the use of force, and to put an end to all such attacks”</p>
<p>The civilians are electing these terror groups to their governements.  In fact most of the civilian populations is behind Hamas, Hezbollah.</p>
<p>Clinton’s roadmap to peace only allowed them to build-up arms.  The UN is worthless.</p>
<p>What you don’t understand is the big pictures where russia and china are very big players.</p>
