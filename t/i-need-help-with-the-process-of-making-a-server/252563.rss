    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-the-process-of-making-a-server/252563</link>
    <description>I&#39;m almost done with my server, but im stuck on the no-ip part. I downloaded the DUC and i made the server name on the no-ip.com. It does not show my server on the DUC V2.2.1 and it says &quot;Checking Remote Ip address. Then on the Update to Ip is says &quot;Checking...&quot; and i can&#39;t press the options.

PLEASE HELP ME</description>
