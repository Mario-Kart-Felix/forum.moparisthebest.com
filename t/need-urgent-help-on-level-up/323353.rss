    <title>Need urgent help on level up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-urgent-help-on-level-up/323353</link>
    <description>I was adding level up interfaces to my source which is a palidino76 base. The coding was rough and extremely messy but I managed to fix all the errors except for one. Which is this:

[code].\Source\Engine.java:48: cannot access Source.content.Levelup
bad class file: .\Source\content\Levelup.java
file does not contain class Source.content.Levelup
Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the classpa
th.
import Source.content.Levelup;
                     ^
Press any key to continue . . .[/code]


please help me! I think that it&#39;s packaged wrong, but I don&#39;t know where to put the file even if it is! Please help!</description>
