    <description>I&#39;ve got a story for you guys. Feel free to share similar experiences at the end.

So I commute to the college I attend, which is about 3 miles from where I live. My car was totaled while parked by someone who veered off the road, so I have to take the shuttle bus (paid for by the school) to and from my classes.

On Monday nights and Wednesday nights, our ultimate frisbee team has the turn reserved from 8-10pm, so we have time to practice. As a result of this late hour, I take the last bus, which leaves from campus at 10:30pm. 

So I take the bus, which drops me off about a half mile (.8km) from my house. I arrive at the stop at about 10:45, and normally get home at 11. In the suburbs of baltimore, about 1 mile from the city line and 5 miles from downtown, you have to watch yourself depending on where you are. To get home, I cut through my neighborhood, which is relatively safe most of the time. 

Last night, I had just turned a street into the entrance of my neighborhood. I start walking along, like any casual night. It is particularly rainy and a bit foggy. As a result, not many people are out, and things are a bit quieter. As I&#39;m walking down the sidewalk, a car is driving up the road, heading toward and past me. I&#39;m pretty tired from practice, and take little note to the object that just flew by me. It appeared to be a ball, but I didn&#39;t bother processing it that much. I thought for a second it might&#39;ve come from the car, but shrugged it off and kept walking. 

At this point, I notice that same car head down the road and pass me. This road is a bit long, a takes about 4 minutes to casually stroll down. The car then disappears at the end, turns around and drives by me again, heading away. Once more, the car drives down the road directioned to go infront of me, but this time it lines up with me and slows down. I keep walking, thinking they were looking for parking. 

So because of frisbee earlier, along with moderate rain during practice, I didn&#39;t really change afterward and just went home in what I had on. I was wearing running shorts, a long sleeve T, soccer cleats, and a peacoat, for warmth. Additionally, I was wearing my backpack, containing notrbooks, clothes, other shoes, and my laptop. 

Anyway, I hear the car door shut, and instinctually turn around. A quick glance gives me the following picture: a man of unknown age, wearing a T shirt and jeans, along with gloves a full white mask, with only 2 eye holes. The mask tips me off in the split second of analysation, and I realize that what could go down. It&#39;s at this moment that the fight or flight response kicks in, and I summon the power of 4 years of XC and track as I look forward and take off. 

I had a bit of an advantage, as I was a few steps ahead of the guy and am pretty naturally fast. Additionally, I don&#39;t imagine he reacted immediately, but I soon heard him follow. I have to make my way to the grass, as I&#39;m wearing cleats and the ground is very wet. I&#39;m running at full speed with an additionally 50lbs on my back too, from the bag. I then have to cross an intersection, at which point I almost slip due to the lack of traction, but I stay up and keep hauling ass. 

As I was running, I was shouting &quot;help&quot; as loud as I could, hoping for something. This proved to work in my favor. Eventually, I reach a point where I hear nothing. Glancing over my shoulder, I see nothing. I figure that the shouting scared them off, as since they had a car, if they wanted to reach me they could&#39;ve. I was prepared to cut through non car routes, which could&#39;ve been crucial. 

From here, I jogged home, still so confused and unable to process what happened and I haven&#39;t slept as now it&#39;s 7:45am. So yea, that was my night. Everything literally happened so fast, and for whatever reason I knew that that was the time to start hauling ass. It&#39;s crazy to think how if anything had happened differently I could be in a lot worse of a situation.</description>

<p>Truama? not really. I’m a bit jumpy when I hear cars slowing down at night nowadays, but I’m mentally fine. It’s more of an awareness thing, as I do live a mile away from Baltimore City, which has posted high crime numbers for years.</p>

<p>It can be so strange though. I was a grand juror a couple of weeks back and you would not believe some of the crazy stuff you hear about people doing in your own hometown. While I do live on one of the better sides fo town I was still shocked about some of the crazy acts.</p>

              <p>I’ve got a story for you guys. Feel free to share similar experiences at the end.</p>
<p>So I commute to the college I attend, which is about 3 miles from where I live. My car was totaled while parked by someone who veered off the road, so I have to take the shuttle bus (paid for by the school) to and from my classes.</p>
<p>On Monday nights and Wednesday nights, our ultimate frisbee team has the turn reserved from 8-10pm, so we have time to practice. As a result of this late hour, I take the last bus, which leaves from campus at 10:30pm.</p>
<p>So I take the bus, which drops me off about a half mile (.8km) from my house. I arrive at the stop at about 10:45, and normally get home at 11. In the suburbs of baltimore, about 1 mile from the city line and 5 miles from downtown, you have to watch yourself depending on where you are. To get home, I cut through my neighborhood, which is relatively safe most of the time.</p>
<p>Last night, I had just turned a street into the entrance of my neighborhood. I start walking along, like any casual night. It is particularly rainy and a bit foggy. As a result, not many people are out, and things are a bit quieter. As I’m walking down the sidewalk, a car is driving up the road, heading toward and past me. I’m pretty tired from practice, and take little note to the object that just flew by me. It appeared to be a ball, but I didn’t bother processing it that much. I thought for a second it might’ve come from the car, but shrugged it off and kept walking.</p>
<p>At this point, I notice that same car head down the road and pass me. This road is a bit long, a takes about 4 minutes to casually stroll down. The car then disappears at the end, turns around and drives by me again, heading away. Once more, the car drives down the road directioned to go infront of me, but this time it lines up with me and slows down. I keep walking, thinking they were looking for parking.</p>
<p>So because of frisbee earlier, along with moderate rain during practice, I didn’t really change afterward and just went home in what I had on. I was wearing running shorts, a long sleeve T, soccer cleats, and a peacoat, for warmth. Additionally, I was wearing my backpack, containing notrbooks, clothes, other shoes, and my laptop.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hear the car door shut, and instinctually turn around. A quick glance gives me the following picture: a man of unknown age, wearing a T shirt and jeans, along with gloves a full white mask, with only 2 eye holes. The mask tips me off in the split second of analysation, and I realize that what could go down. It’s at this moment that the fight or flight response kicks in, and I summon the power of 4 years of XC and track as I look forward and take off.</p>
<p>I had a bit of an advantage, as I was a few steps ahead of the guy and am pretty naturally fast. Additionally, I don’t imagine he reacted immediately, but I soon heard him follow. I have to make my way to the grass, as I’m wearing cleats and the ground is very wet. I’m running at full speed with an additionally 50lbs on my back too, from the bag. I then have to cross an intersection, at which point I almost slip due to the lack of traction, but I stay up and keep hauling ass.</p>
<p>As I was running, I was shouting “help” as loud as I could, hoping for something. This proved to work in my favor. Eventually, I reach a point where I hear nothing. Glancing over my shoulder, I see nothing. I figure that the shouting scared them off, as since they had a car, if they wanted to reach me they could’ve. I was prepared to cut through non car routes, which could’ve been crucial.</p>
<p>From here, I jogged home, still so confused and unable to process what happened and I haven’t slept as now it’s 7:45am. So yea, that was my night. Everything literally happened so fast, and for whatever reason I knew that that was the time to start hauling ass. It’s crazy to think how if anything had happened differently I could be in a lot worse of a situation.</p>
