    <title>[PI] character moonwalks away when trying to attack npc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-character-moonwalks-away-when-trying-to-attack-npc/399489</link>
    <description>Well when you attack a npc on the server im trying to edit, what happens is your character keeps moon walking away towards north east.

this does not happen on all npc&#39;s but it does on quite a few others?

any1 know why? or what i could be causing this or how i can fix lol?</description>
