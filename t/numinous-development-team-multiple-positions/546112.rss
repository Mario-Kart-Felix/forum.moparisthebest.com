I am proud to announce the eminent arrival of Numinous. For many months now I, and a longtime friend/ partner, have been working avidly on this project with intentions of opening its doors to the public and taking it as far as we can. We&#39;ve had much success with our projects throughout the past, but due to some personal issues they&#39;ve not lasted more than 6 months of 24-7 up-time. With that being said; we have finally decided to buckle down and put what we&#39;ve learned to the test with the opening of Numinous&#39; Beta. Numinous offers many unique and simple tools to help our players login and flawlessly PK as they please without stopping. These tools include many different gear, teleport, and leveling commands that make PvP as enjoyable as possible with PvP locations outside of banks and a highly edited combat system with very good combat formulas and switching while maintaining a solid 24-7 up-time via vps.

[SPOILER=What do we stand for?]
What does the word Numinous stand for?: Numinous, as eloquently as it sounds, has a much deeper meaning. Numinous is a feeling of a presence of divinity, or a fearful experience that is also exhilarating and provokes inspiration. 

What do we stand for as the Numinous Development Team?: Numinous; The next leading innovation in your RSPS experience. We, The Numinous Development Team, strive to emulate a unique amd invigorating experience for our whole communal player base. Here at Numinous we offer advanced integration among our common entities of website and server to help make your experience more enjoyable. Our development team is, and will continue to remain, professional and determined. We listen to your suggestions in recognition that our player base is what makes the server. With easily accessible resources both forums and server sided, Numinous is an enjoyable form of nostalgia from a more enlightened period of Runescape which we all knew and loved. With daily updates, server advancement is inevitable and necessary to maintain a unique and revolutionary RSPS experience. We are excited to see you in-game and can&#39;t wait to initiate this perpetual experience.
