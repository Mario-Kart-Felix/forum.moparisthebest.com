<p>I am proud to announce the eminent arrival of Numinous. For many months now I, and a longtime friend/ partner, have been working avidly on this project with intentions of opening its doors to the public and taking it as far as we can. We’ve had much success with our projects throughout the past, but due to some personal issues they’ve not lasted more than 6 months of 24-7 up-time. With that being said; we have finally decided to buckle down and put what we’ve learned to the test with the opening of Numinous’ Beta. Numinous offers many unique and simple tools to help our players login and flawlessly PK as they please without stopping. These tools include many different gear, teleport, and leveling commands that make PvP as enjoyable as possible with PvP locations outside of banks and a highly edited combat system with very good combat formulas and switching while maintaining a solid 24-7 up-time via vps.</p>
