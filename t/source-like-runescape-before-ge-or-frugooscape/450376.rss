    <title>Source Like RuneScape Before GE? or FrugooScape?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/source-like-runescape-before-ge-or-frugooscape/450376</link>
    <description>Okay, I am looking for a source, I have been going through the sources, that is like RuneScape before the Grand Exchange or be pretty close to FrugooScape. There is no need for the people who are about to flame me for being &quot;lazy&quot; I just want to know if you&#39;ve came across a server like this and could send me a link while I look on my own. I&#39;m not looking for a clean source, I&#39;d like to have many things done if not all so I can make changes to my liking. I have had a sever that was almost completely coded by me but my Hard Drive fried and I lost everything. It&#39;s been 2-3 years since I&#39;ve done anything with private servers. Anyways, if any of you can help me out, it would be great. (:
Thanks,
Johnny</description>
