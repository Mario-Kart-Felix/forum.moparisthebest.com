    <title>My additions to RuneFX source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-additions-to-runefx-source/378917</link>
    <description>Ok, well Instead of posting all my developments in different threads, I will just put them all here.

I just barley started Java coding, so none of this stuff is really big, but I am proud of myself, even though anyone can do it.

First of all, Creds:
Me for making these things
Rash for the RuneFX source and client (based off of Project Insanity I believe)

So on this source, some fletching things were not working, or just not doable, and for some other skills too, so I decided to TRY perfecting a few, fletching isn&#39;t completly perfect yet, but for the most part it is (mostly useless things arn&#39;t there.

I added this to the &quot;Useitem&quot; java file located src&gt;server&gt;model&gt;items&gt;useitem.java
[code]		if (itemUsed == 53 &amp;&amp; useWith == 11237 || itemUsed == 11237 &amp;&amp; useWith == 53) {//Dragon Arrows
			if (c.playerLevel[c.playerFletching] &gt;= 90) {
				int arrowsMade = c.getItems().getItemAmount(itemUsed) &gt; c.getItems().getItemAmount(useWith) ? c.getItems().getItemAmount(useWith) : c.getItems().getItemAmount(itemUsed);
				c.getItems().deleteItem(useWith, c.getItems().getItemSlot(useWith), arrowsMade);
				c.getItems().deleteItem(itemUsed, c.getItems().getItemSlot(itemUsed), arrowsMade);
				c.getItems().addItem(11212, arrowsMade);
				c.getPA().addSkillXP(20 * Config.FLETCHING_EXPERIENCE, c.playerFletching);
			} else {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;You need a fletching level of 90 to fletch this item.&quot;);
			}
		}
		if (itemUsed == 413 &amp;&amp; useWith == 1755 || itemUsed == 1755 &amp;&amp; useWith == 413) {//make pearl bolttips
			if (c.playerLevel[c.playerFletching] &gt;= 41) {
				c.getItems().deleteItem(413, c.getItems().getItemSlot(413), 1);
				c.getItems().addItem(46, 15);
				c.getPA().addSkillXP(3 * Config.FLETCHING_EXPERIENCE, c.playerFletching);
			} else {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;You need a fletching level of 41 to fletch this item.&quot;);
			}
		}
		if (itemUsed == 46 &amp;&amp; useWith == 9140 || itemUsed == 9140 &amp;&amp; useWith == 46) {//make pearl bolts (e)
			if (c.playerLevel[c.playerFletching] &gt;= 41) {
				int boltsMade = c.getItems().getItemAmount(itemUsed) &gt; c.getItems().getItemAmount(useWith) ? c.getItems().getItemAmount(useWith) : c.getItems().getItemAmount(itemUsed);
				c.getItems().deleteItem(useWith, c.getItems().getItemSlot(useWith), boltsMade);
				c.getItems().deleteItem(itemUsed, c.getItems().getItemSlot(itemUsed), boltsMade);
				c.getItems().addItem(9238, boltsMade);
				c.getPA().addSkillXP(3 * Config.FLETCHING_EXPERIENCE, c.playerFletching);
			} else {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;You need a fletching level of 41 to fletch this item.&quot;);
			}
		}
		if (itemUsed == 1613 &amp;&amp; useWith == 1755 || itemUsed == 1755 &amp;&amp; useWith == 1613) {//make topaz boltips
			if (c.playerLevel[c.playerFletching] &gt;= 48) {
				c.getItems().deleteItem(1613, c.getItems().getItemSlot(1613), 1);
				c.getItems().addItem(9188, 15);
				c.getPA().addSkillXP(4 * Config.FLETCHING_EXPERIENCE, c.playerFletching);
			} else {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;You need a fletching level of 48 to fletch this item.&quot;);
			}
		}
		if (itemUsed == 9188 &amp;&amp; useWith == 9141 || itemUsed == 9141 &amp;&amp; useWith == 9188) {//make topaz bolts (e)
			if (c.playerLevel[c.playerFletching] &gt;= 48) {
				int boltsMade = c.getItems().getItemAmount(itemUsed) &gt; c.getItems().getItemAmount(useWith) ? c.getItems().getItemAmount(useWith) : c.getItems().getItemAmount(itemUsed);

				c.getPA().addSkillXP(4 * Config.FLETCHING_EXPERIENCE, c.playerFletching);
			} else {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;You need a fletching level of 48 to fletch this item.&quot;);
			}
		}
		if (itemUsed == 6573 &amp;&amp; useWith == 1755 || itemUsed == 1755 &amp;&amp; useWith == 6573) {//make Onyx boltips
			if (c.playerLevel[c.playerFletching] &gt;= 73) {
				c.getItems().deleteItem(6573, c.getItems().getItemSlot(6573), 1);
				c.getItems().addItem(9194, 15);
				c.getPA().addSkillXP(9 * Config.FLETCHING_EXPERIENCE, c.playerFletching);
			} else {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;You need a fletching level of 73 to fletch this item.&quot;);
			}
		}
		if (itemUsed == 9194 &amp;&amp; useWith == 9144 || itemUsed == 9144 &amp;&amp; useWith == 9194) {//make Onyx Bolts (e)
			if (c.playerLevel[c.playerFletching] &gt;= 73) {
				int boltsMade = c.getItems().getItemAmount(itemUsed) &gt; c.getItems().getItemAmount(useWith) ? c.getItems().getItemAmount(useWith) : c.getItems().getItemAmount(itemUsed);
				c.getItems().deleteItem(useWith, c.getItems().getItemSlot(useWith), boltsMade);

				c.getItems().addItem(9245, boltsMade);
				c.getPA().addSkillXP(9 * Config.FLETCHING_EXPERIENCE, c.playerFletching);
			} else {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;You need a fletching level of 73 to fletch this item.&quot;);
			}
		}[/code]
Now I bet most people reading this are thinking, well this is a simple copy and paste job with a few edits. Well your right it COULD have been that, but to get used to Java, I took it upon myself to type this all up with a little reference, while trying to not look at the example as much, and I have to say I did a pretty good job in the end.

Ok so bassicaly what I added, is:
The ability to make Dragon Arrows, using the arrowtips bought from the shop (90 fletching needed)

The ability to make Pearl Bolts (e) and Bolt Tips by using a chisel on oyster pearls (for tips, bought from shop) and putting them on iron bolts (from smithing.) (41 fletching needed)

The ability to make Topaz Bolts (e) and bolt tips by using a chisel on a cut red Topaz (for tips, bought from shop) and putting them on steel bolts (from smithing) (48 fletching needed)

And the ability to make Onyx Bolts (e) and bolt tips by using a chisel on a cut Onyx (bought from shop, its pricy!) and putting them on rune bolts (from smithing) (73 fletching needed)

I did not add making c&#39;bows, because i had no clue how to obtain the limbs.

UPDATE 1/18/11: turns out you couldn&#39;t use onyx (e) with a crossbow, so I found how to add it and did!

So in CombatAssistant.java located at src&gt;server&gt;model&gt;players&gt;CombatAssisstant.java you need to add 2 things

first, search &quot;properbolts&quot; and go until you see:
[code]	public boolean properBolts() {
		return c.playerEquipment[c.playerArrows] &gt;= 9140 &amp;&amp; c.playerEquipment[c.playerArrows] &lt;= 9144
				|| c.playerEquipment[c.playerArrows] &gt;= 9240 &amp;&amp; c.playerEquipment[c.playerArrows] &lt;= 9244;
	}[/code]
Right where it says &quot;[c.playerArrows] &lt;= 9244&quot; (close to the end) change the &quot;9244&quot; to &quot;9245&quot; which then makes onyx (e) bolts able to use with a cbow, but it doesnt give any bonuses, right now it basically wouldn&#39;t do any damage (well maybe some but really low) and since these are better than dragonstone (e), lets add the range str bonus.

This time search &quot;case 9244&quot; and you will find:
[code]			case 9244://dragon bolts e
			return 117;[/code]

press return (enter) after the 117; and put this:
[code]			case 9245://Onyx bolts e
			return 120;[/code]

The 120 is how much range str bonus it gives, I took it from the real RS (120) that I figured out using rune wiki :D, you can make it more, which I actually did, cause it just seemed weak to me.

Thinking of adding:
1. c&#39;bows
2. The ability to cut a certain dragon thing and make dragon arrowtips (instead of buying)
3. Turns out, bronze bolts are not in the source, so I might add those so you can do Opal bolts.
4. there was no way to mine blurite, so I might add that rock so you can make Jade bolts.

P.S. The skilling shop was overloaded, so I made fletching shop, just add this code into your &quot;Shops.cfg&quot; and configure it to an npc.

Shop:
[code]shop = 24	Fletching_Shop	1	1	1755	100	946	100	1349	100	1359	100	413	100	1613	100	1605	1000	1603	1000	1601	1000	1615	1000	314	100000	11237	100000[/code]

Also, you need to set the spawn-config for the npc that has the shop, I added him to both skilling areas (donor and non donor) I also added bob (skilling store) to the donor skilling place.

[code]
spawn = 519	2330	3690	0	1	0	0	0	skillshop (donor)
spawn = 679	2328	3692	0	0	0	0	0	Fletching Shop
spawn = 679	2844	3434	0	0	0	0	0	Fletching Shop
[/code]

add this to assign the shop (explained a bit later):
[code]			case 679://Fletching shop, Skilling areas, ranged guild gaurd
				c.getShops().openShop(24);
			break;[/code]

Pics of fletch thing I did:

[IMG]http://i614.photobucket.com/albums/tt230/dogss8/Pic3.png[/img]








Now onto another thing I added, I added 2 new commands and an AdminZone (unfinished, still going to add a few things)

First the adminzone,

I felt the admins needed a chill zone, so i constructed an adminzone (well started). So far, all there is is a bank and a shop, but I will add more when I think of it.

so first of all, you need the command, commands are added into the &quot;Commands.java&quot; located at src&gt;server&gt;model&gt;players&gt;packet&gt;Commands.java
[code]			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;adminzone&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &lt; 2) {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;Only Admins can use this command!&quot;);
			}
if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;adminzone&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 2) {
	        c.getPA().startTeleport(2737, 3470, 0, &quot;modern&quot;);
		c.sendMessage(&quot;Welcome to the Admin Zone!&quot;);
     }[/code]

The reason the command is listed twice, is because while coding the command I added an } else { statement on whether they were admin or not, but it decided to show that message whenever I used any command, so i figured if I did that it would work better (saw it for the yell command) again I typed it all, no copy+paste. (I did have a reference for some things though).

Well after you have added that, you need to add the shop, here is the shop code I made, it includes everything that I felt an admin would like.

[code]shop = 23	Admin_Store	1	1	15007	1000	15006	1000	15005	1000	15004	1000	15017	1000	15018	1000	15019	1000	15020	1000	15008	1000	15009	1000	15011	1000	15012	1000	15013	1000	15014	1000	15015	1000	15016	1000	15055	1000	15021	1000	15022	1000	15023	1000	15024	1000	15025	1000	15026	1000	15037	1000	15038	1000	15039	1000	15040	1000	14497	1000	14499	1000	14501	1000	15027	1000	9703	1000[/code]

now you need to assign that to an NPC, so go to &quot;ActionHandler.java&quot; located at src&gt;server&gt;model&gt;players&gt;ActionHandler.java

then find the spot where you assign shops (I am not going to make a full on tutorial, as it is simple enough)

and add this code:
[code]			case 659://Admin Store Party Pete
				c.getShops().openShop(23);
			break;[/code]

the &quot;case 659&quot; is what npc is used, I used party pete, you use what you want!

And remember, add the spawn config!
[code]
spawn = 659	2732	3472	0	0	0	0	0	Admin Store
spawn = 494	2734	3475	0	3	0	0	0	Bank for Admin place[/code]

Admin zone pics:

[IMG]http://i614.photobucket.com/albums/tt230/dogss8/Pic6.png[/img]





Next command, me and my friends were testing something, and got annoyed by some slayer assignments, but rather then completly removing those, I added a command that i named &quot;resettask&quot; that allows you to reset your slayer task, and get a new one.

So add this to the Commands.java file (REMEMBER UNDER PLAYER COMMANDS!)
[code]
			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;taskreset&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.slayerTask == -1 &amp;&amp; c.taskAmount == 0) {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;You don&#39;t have a task!&quot;);
			}
			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;taskreset&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.slayerTask &gt; -1 &amp;&amp; c.taskAmount &gt; 0) {
				c.slayerTask = -1;
				c.taskAmount = 0;
				c.sendMessage(&quot;Your task has been reset!&quot;);
}[/code]

the reason there are 2 things, is again, it glitched.

So thats basically all I have updated so far, suggest what I should work on next, tell me what I should fix, you know!

again, A BIG thank you to Rash for his awesome base that I am working with!</description>

<p>I just barley started Java coding, so none of this stuff is really big, but I am proud of myself, even though anyone can do it.</p>
<p>First of all, Creds:<br>
Me for making these things<br>
Rash for the RuneFX source and client (based off of Project Insanity I believe)</p>
<p>So on this source, some fletching things were not working, or just not doable, and for some other skills too, so I decided to TRY perfecting a few, fletching isn’t completly perfect yet, but for the most part it is (mostly useless things arn’t there.</p>
<p>I added this to the “Useitem” java file located src&gt;server&gt;model&gt;items&gt;useitem.java</p>
<p><code>		if (itemUsed == 53 &amp;&amp; useWith == 11237 || itemUsed == 11237 &amp;&amp; useWith == 53) {//Dragon Arrows
			if (c.playerLevel[c.playerFletching] &gt;= 90) {

				c.getItems().deleteItem(useWith, c.getItems().getItemSlot(useWith), arrowsMade);
				c.getItems().deleteItem(itemUsed, c.getItems().getItemSlot(itemUsed), arrowsMade);
				c.getItems().addItem(11212, arrowsMade);
				c.getPA().addSkillXP(20 * Config.FLETCHING_EXPERIENCE, c.playerFletching);
			} else {
				c.sendMessage("You need a fletching level of 90 to fletch this item.");
			}
		}
		if (itemUsed == 413 &amp;&amp; useWith == 1755 || itemUsed == 1755 &amp;&amp; useWith == 413) {//make pearl bolttips

Now I bet most people reading this are thinking, well this is a simple copy and paste job with a few edits. Well your right it COULD have been that, but to get used to Java, I took it upon myself to type this all up with a little reference, while trying to not look at the example as much, and I have to say I did a pretty good job in the end.</p>
<p>Ok so bassicaly what I added, is:<br>
The ability to make Dragon Arrows, using the arrowtips bought from the shop (90 fletching needed)</p>
<p>The ability to make Pearl Bolts (e) and Bolt Tips by using a chisel on oyster pearls (for tips, bought from shop) and putting them on iron bolts (from smithing.) (41 fletching needed)</p>
<p>The ability to make Topaz Bolts (e) and bolt tips by using a chisel on a cut red Topaz (for tips, bought from shop) and putting them on steel bolts (from smithing) (48 fletching needed)</p>
<p>And the ability to make Onyx Bolts (e) and bolt tips by using a chisel on a cut Onyx (bought from shop, its pricy!) and putting them on rune bolts (from smithing) (73 fletching needed)</p>
<p>I did not add making c’bows, because i had no clue how to obtain the limbs.</p>
<p>UPDATE 1/18/11: turns out you couldn’t use onyx (e) with a crossbow, so I found how to add it and did!</p>
<p>So in CombatAssistant.java located at src&gt;server&gt;model&gt;players&gt;CombatAssisstant.java you need to add 2 things</p>
<p>first, search “properbolts” and go until you see:</p>
<p><code>	public boolean properBolts() {
		return c.playerEquipment[c.playerArrows] &gt;= 9140 &amp;&amp; c.playerEquipment[c.playerArrows] &lt;= 9144
				|| c.playerEquipment[c.playerArrows] &gt;= 9240 &amp;&amp; c.playerEquipment[c.playerArrows] &lt;= 9244;
	}</code><br>
Right where it says “[c.playerArrows] &lt;= 9244” (close to the end) change the “9244” to “9245” which then makes onyx (e) bolts able to use with a cbow, but it doesnt give any bonuses, right now it basically wouldn’t do any damage (well maybe some but really low) and since these are better than dragonstone (e), lets add the range str bonus.</p>
<p>This time search “case 9244” and you will find:</p>
<p><code>			case 9244://dragon bolts e
			return 117;</code></p>
<p>press return (enter) after the 117; and put this:</p>
<p><code>			case 9245://Onyx bolts e
			return 120;</code></p>
<p>The 120 is how much range str bonus it gives, I took it from the real RS (120) that I figured out using rune wiki :D, you can make it more, which I actually did, cause it just seemed weak to me.</p>
<p>Thinking of adding:</p>
<ol>
<li>c’bows</li>
<li>The ability to cut a certain dragon thing and make dragon arrowtips (instead of buying)</li>
<li>Turns out, bronze bolts are not in the source, so I might add those so you can do Opal bolts.</li>
<li>there was no way to mine blurite, so I might add that rock so you can make Jade bolts.</li>
</ol>
<p>P.S. The skilling shop was overloaded, so I made fletching shop, just add this code into your “Shops.cfg” and configure it to an npc.</p>
<p>Shop:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">shop = 24	Fletching_Shop	1	1	1755	100	946	100	1349	100	1359	100	413	100	1613	100	1605	1000	1603	1000	1601	1000	1615	1000	314	100000	11237	100000</code></pre>
<p>Also, you need to set the spawn-config for the npc that has the shop, I added him to both skilling areas (donor and non donor) I also added bob (skilling store) to the donor skilling place.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 519	2330	3690	0	1	0	0	0	skillshop (donor)
spawn = 679	2328	3692	0	0	0	0	0	Fletching Shop
spawn = 679	2844	3434	0	0	0	0	0	Fletching Shop</code></pre>
<p>add this to assign the shop (explained a bit later):</p>
<p><code>			case 679://Fletching shop, Skilling areas, ranged guild gaurd
				c.getShops().openShop(24);
			break;</code></p>
<p>Pics of fletch thing I did:<br>
<img src="http://i614.photobucket.com/albums/tt230/dogss8/Pic4.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<img src="http://i614.photobucket.com/albums/tt230/dogss8/Pic1.png" alt width="251" height="341"><br>
<img src="http://i614.photobucket.com/albums/tt230/dogss8/Pic2.png" alt width="248" height="340"><br>
<img src="http://i614.photobucket.com/albums/tt230/dogss8/Pic3.png" alt width="248" height="340"></p>
<p>Now onto another thing I added, I added 2 new commands and an AdminZone (unfinished, still going to add a few things)</p>
<p>First the adminzone,</p>
<p>I felt the admins needed a chill zone, so i constructed an adminzone (well started). So far, all there is is a bank and a shop, but I will add more when I think of it.</p>
<p>so first of all, you need the command, commands are added into the “Commands.java” located at src&gt;server&gt;model&gt;players&gt;packet&gt;Commands.java</p>
<p><code>			if (playerCommand.startsWith("adminzone") &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &lt; 2) {
				c.sendMessage("Only Admins can use this command!");
			}
if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase("adminzone") &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 2) {
	        c.getPA().startTeleport(2737, 3470, 0, "modern");
		c.sendMessage("Welcome to the Admin Zone!");
     }</code></p>
<p>The reason the command is listed twice, is because while coding the command I added an } else { statement on whether they were admin or not, but it decided to show that message whenever I used any command, so i figured if I did that it would work better (saw it for the yell command) again I typed it all, no copy+paste. (I did have a reference for some things though).</p>
<p>Well after you have added that, you need to add the shop, here is the shop code I made, it includes everything that I felt an admin would like.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">shop = 23	Admin_Store	1	1	15007	1000	15006	1000	15005	1000	15004	1000	15017	1000	15018	1000	15019	1000	15020	1000	15008	1000	15009	1000	15011	1000	15012	1000	15013	1000	15014	1000	15015	1000	15016	1000	15055	1000	15021	1000	15022	1000	15023	1000	15024	1000	15025	1000	15026	1000	15037	1000	15038	1000	15039	1000	15040	1000	14497	1000	14499	1000	14501	1000	15027	1000	9703	1000</code></pre>
<p>now you need to assign that to an NPC, so go to “ActionHandler.java” located at src&gt;server&gt;model&gt;players&gt;ActionHandler.java</p>
<p>then find the spot where you assign shops (I am not going to make a full on tutorial, as it is simple enough)</p>
<p>and add this code:</p>
<p><code>			case 659://Admin Store Party Pete
				c.getShops().openShop(23);
			break;</code></p>
<p>the “case 659” is what npc is used, I used party pete, you use what you want!</p>
<p>And remember, add the spawn config!</p>
<p><code>
spawn = 659	2732	3472	0	0	0	0	0	Admin Store
spawn = 494	2734	3475	0	3	0	0	0	Bank for Admin place</code></p>
<p>Admin zone pics:<br>
<img src="http://i614.photobucket.com/albums/tt230/dogss8/Pic5.png" alt width="382" height="233"><br>
<img src="http://i614.photobucket.com/albums/tt230/dogss8/Pic6.png" alt width="497" height="308"></p>
<p>Next command, me and my friends were testing something, and got annoyed by some slayer assignments, but rather then completly removing those, I added a command that i named “resettask” that allows you to reset your slayer task, and get a new one.</p>
<p>So add this to the Commands.java file (REMEMBER UNDER PLAYER COMMANDS!)</p>
<p><code>
			if (playerCommand.startsWith("taskreset") &amp;&amp; c.slayerTask == -1 &amp;&amp; c.taskAmount == 0) {
				c.sendMessage("You don't have a task!");
			}
			if (playerCommand.startsWith("taskreset") &amp;&amp; c.slayerTask &gt; -1 &amp;&amp; c.taskAmount &gt; 0) {
				c.slayerTask = -1;
				c.taskAmount = 0;
				c.sendMessage("Your task has been reset!");
}</code></p>
<p>the reason there are 2 things, is again, it glitched.</p>
<p>So thats basically all I have updated so far, suggest what I should work on next, tell me what I should fix, you know!</p>
<p>again, A BIG thank you to Rash for his awesome base that I am working with!</p>
