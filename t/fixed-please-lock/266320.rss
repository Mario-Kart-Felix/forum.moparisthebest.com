<p>Get a fucking life. It’s a “symbol”. It only does damage if you continue to assosiate it (it used to be used in coca cola adverts). Plus, it’s wrong. If you look at it from the receiving end of the sword, which shapes on swords are supposed to be interpreted, it’s backwards. The symbol appears in many cultures so it’s impossible to find its exact origin.</p>
<p>I like the sword. As a replica not bad. If you choose to make it more original, perhaps ajust the blade with a curve. Just my thoughts.</p>

I’m not ignorant. its not racist though. to be jewish isnt a race, its a religious decision.<br>
This symbol is well known as the Nazi Swastica, and therefore, people will find it offensive. stop your bitchin about our ‘ignorance’ when you’re ignorant to the fact that this could severely offend jewish people.i doubt anyone of us watches w/e show this is from, so we cant say thats how its intended to be. we all have our right to opinion.</p>

<p>and @ xxx123xxx : The “Nazi’s” took the symbol, altough im not sure that it belongs to the indians.<br>
It’s not saying anything because the symbol is well known as the nazi symbol of the “Führer”.</p>
