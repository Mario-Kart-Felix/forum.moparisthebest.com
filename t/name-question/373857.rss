    <title>Name Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/name-question/373857</link>
    <description>Alright, I&#39;m having some trouble here with names. So I was going to take some opinions from the members:


I&#39;m going to program a Project-Insanity, and I don&#39;t know what I was going to call it. I was thinking of calling it Bronze Age as I called my Deltascape base. Then again, I was thinking of something like calling it: Bronze Age Rebirth, Bronze Age Reborn or something, I have no idea!

So.. Yeah, I&#39;m going to need a opinion on whether or not to keep the Bronze Age name, or name it something else. It would also help to give me a few ideas for names.

Thanks,

James</description>

Oh… Interesting, that is quite creative there. I might take this name into consideration.</p>

              <p>heres what ive thought up over looking through different servers:<br>
if your name has n X in it example Crapscape, which has no clipping whatsoever, overkill of polies, no content, boring, and absolutely nothing to do, no one would play it<br>
If its name was CrapscapeX, it would have around 500 players a day, im not sure, but thats what ive developed, because there are so many good servers out there, but dont have X in their name, but every server ive seen with X in its name, became successful, i tried them out, and they are pieces of crap servers, but only because they have X in their name<br>
Thats the theory ive developed, so whatever your name will be, it must have an X in it (not saying yours will be crappy, but alot of people joined others servers, i even questioned them, because it has X in its name!)</p>

              <p>Alright, I’m having some trouble here with names. So I was going to take some opinions from the members:</p>
<p>I’m going to program a Project-Insanity, and I don’t know what I was going to call it. I was thinking of calling it Bronze Age as I called my Deltascape base. Then again, I was thinking of something like calling it: Bronze Age Rebirth, Bronze Age Reborn or something, I have no idea!</p>
<p>So… Yeah, I’m going to need a opinion on whether or not to keep the Bronze Age name, or name it something else. It would also help to give me a few ideas for names.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
