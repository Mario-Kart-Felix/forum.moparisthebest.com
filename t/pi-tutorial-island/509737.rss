    <title>[PI] Tutorial Island</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-tutorial-island/509737</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve added Tutorial Island to my server and it&#39;s perfect in my point of view. But there is one thing that is messed up. If somebody were to log out during Tutorial Island and log back in, their place wouldn&#39;t be saved. Not position, the step they&#39;re on. I know I didn&#39;t explain that very good.

Example - 
I have added 
[code]public int tutIsland = 0;[/code]
to keep track of where they&#39;re at. Let&#39;s say you start out at 0 and when you talk to the first guy it goes to 1 and so on. Now let&#39;s say that they&#39;re on 8 and they log out. You would be reset back to 0, but still be at the same X and Y position.

I have added:
[code]characterfile.write(&quot;tutIsland = &quot;, 0, 10);
			characterfile.write(Integer.toString(p.tutIsland), 0, Integer.toString(p.tutIsland).length());
			characterfile.newLine();[/code]
and:
[code]	} else if (token.equals(&quot;tutIsland&quot;)) {
						p.tutIsland = Integer.parseInt(token2);[/code]
to PlayerSave.java and I have no idea what is wrong.</description>
