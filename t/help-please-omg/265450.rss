Ok, i was playing this server. it has the best source ever, im here trying to find out the name of that source. it starts off in a beggining island or somewhat, where you either pick pure, master, range pure, or whatever. and after that it logs you off. when you log back in ur in clan wars and there&#39;s a bunch of pkers outside of clan wars. there&#39;s orange doors covering people from pking inside clan wars. i am asking you this as a favor =[
