    <description>Hello Mopar,

I was wondering how i would fix some models in my client, skill cape ones... they are team capes but not skill capes, how would i add the correct models to the client? 

&amp; another thing, weapon timers (Like the DDS) i wanted to change it so it would hit correctly &amp; on time like it should,

Yes i&#39;m using a DeltaScape base.

Thanks for reading -
