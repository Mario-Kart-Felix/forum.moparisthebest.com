    <title>A few questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions/151044</link>
    <description>Yeah, just a few.. If you can answer ANY of them, I&#39;d appreciate it.

First ... Any idea how to stop NPCs from walking directly through objects? Because on most bases, when you&#39;ve ranged or maged an NPC, they&#39;ll walk right through objects to get to you.

Second ... Any idea how to fix my computer? For the past while I&#39;ve been unable to log into other no-ip servers. I&#39;m surprised that I am still able to log into Hamachi servers.

Anyways, I&#39;ll think of more questions when I find something I don&#39;t know how to fix, or something like that. Thanks</description>

<p>This happened to me, But i didn’t fixed it. After awhile of not playing any server it worked again, Try not opening moparscape or a client you have for say 3 days to a week, And see if it fixes your problem, If not sorry, And sorry for not being more helpful.<br>

<p>True, happened to me before, try that.</p>
<p>As for your first problem i think Newb 2341 posted a tutorial on invisible walls? I think that would kinda help, but it would be very hard due to random objects being in the way, and unaccurate X’s and Y’s. But if its a open field, then yeah that would work.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well I need a real fix, not a quick fix :\ And, thanks for the “idea” on how to connect to other servers.</p>
