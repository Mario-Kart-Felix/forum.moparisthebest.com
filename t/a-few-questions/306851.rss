              <p>Edit it with notepad. Btw a good thing to use would get notepad++ it will help a lot when you start editing in client.java because it will show all the {} and most of the common mistakes are because you have forgotten one of those easy to remember symbols</p>

              <p>Answer 1: Basically you find the login method and the coords you start at then change them to the place you want the players to start. To put bankers and shops go into autospawn.cfg and change the coordinates of the npcâ€™s that you want to fit your needed area.<br>
Answer 2: I have no idea never needed Winter Before Sorry.<br>
Answer 3:<code>	    if (command.startsWith("pickup") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) {
		        String[] args = command.split(" ");
	         if(args.length == 3) {
			int newItemID = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
			int newItemAmount = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);
			if (newItemID &lt;= 160000 &amp;&amp; newItemID &gt;= 0) {
				addItem(newItemID, newItemAmount);
			} else {
				sM("No such item.");
			}
		} else {
			sM("Oops! Use as ::pickup 995 100");
		}
	    }
}</code> Just search "master: and above that one paste the pickup code and make sure to go into your character files and give yourself rights of 3</p>
