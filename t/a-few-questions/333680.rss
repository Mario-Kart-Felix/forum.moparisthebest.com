    <title>A few questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions/333680</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m John. I&#39;m working on my server and well to tell the truth I&#39;m not the best coder out there.

I need help with a few things:

First off, where are all those files such as NPCDef.xml and NPCs.rscd?

How do I get range and mage to work? Please, just get me started. I&#39;d like to learn and be helped.

How do I fix the weapons so they are correctly equipped and used?</description>

<p>.rscd are found in the client config folder, i think its clientfolder/conf/client/…  XML’s are found in the server, should be in the config folder of server directory.</p>
<p>What source are you using? range and magic should already work in most sources…</p>
<p>Sorry cant help you on last question, im not familiar with wielding weapons</p>
