    <title>A few questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions/280394</link>
    <description>I am pretty new to modeling and had a few questions...

1. When i make a new model and rename between 8000-15000 then put it in my models folder, change class8.java, compile, run, and add models sometimes the model shows up invisible in my inventory or when i equip it it looks weird.

2. I made new skill cape and it equips in the weapon slot, and when you run it does not do the right cape animation, my body just seperates from the cape and my legs go through the bottom of it.

3. I also redid the dragon plate and am having the same problem and it also doesn&#39;t look like it fits on the body.

              <p>1: This is a lag most the time, if you just move the item to a different spot, the inv model should show up.<br>
2: You need to add the cape to your item.java’s cape section.</p>
<p>Go into your server folder and open up item.java, then search for:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> public static int capes[] = </code></pre>
<p>after the = sign there should be a {, add your capes item ID after that, be sure to put a comma after the item ID.</p>
<p>2B: You cape isn’t animated correctly, animating a cape is confusing so i cant really help.</p>
<p>3: If the dragon plate is a 500+ model, the characters are build differently and it will not look 100% on your character.</p>
