    <title>A few questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions/480699</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just started coding private servers, and have 3 sources that i really like. The first source is a 317, the second source is a 525 and the third source is a 474. What i don&#39;t understand is what 317, 525 and 474 mean/stand for. What&#39;s the difference between the three? I know i probably sound stupid, but i&#39;m new to all of this. Can anybody help?</description>

The protocol/revision number. You can read about some protocol here: <a href="http://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/index.php?title=Category:RS2" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Click me</a>.<br>
Also, you don’t sound stupid in the least. At least you bother to ask some questions about what the protocols are instead of jumping straight into a 718 (more recent RuneScape revision), like most of the newcomers here who don’t even know what a string is.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thank-you for your post. This was extremely useful.</p>
