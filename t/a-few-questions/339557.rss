<ol start="2">
<li>You’d need SQL for that?</li>
<li>Client.java, GUI.Java</li>
<li>I’d say Delta, Winterlove,  Project Insanity (474)</li>

              <p>Well honestly a good base is Hyperion but you’re obvoisuly not that good at java so id say DeltaCleaned.<br>
Yes there is a way to market peoples items. You can do it manually set up a donation list and have people donate for items.<br>
Things you can change such as names are easy! Go into client.java and press Ctrl + F and search for RovaScape or whatever the name is and replace it with your server name and then click compile.</p>
<p>Good luck programming</p>
