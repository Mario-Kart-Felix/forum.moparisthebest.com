    <description>Hi, I made my own runescape private server last night and I&#39;m having troubles. I was wondering how to get myself admin yes I have tried searching gone through tutorials nothing. Also I&#39;m having problem with starter equipment: This is my code:

[code]
		//Giving the player an unique look
		playerEquipment[playerHat]=Blue PartyHat(2422);
		playerEquipment[playerCape]=Lava Cape(6570);
		playerEquipment[playerAmulet]=Amulet of fury(6585);
		playerEquipment[playerChest]=Dragon Chain(3141);
		playerEquipment[playerShield]=Crystal Shield(4224);
		playerEquipment[playerLegs]=Dragon Legs(4088);
		playerEquipment[playerHands]=Barrow Gloves(7462);
		playerEquipment[playerFeet]=Rune boots(4132);
		playerEquipment[playerRing]=Beserker Ring(6738);
		playerEquipment[playerArrows]=Item.randomArrows();
		playerEquipment[playerWeapon]=4151;[/code]

Am I doing something wrong? Thanks again. And finally I have a no-ip server but how do I let other people connect to it it won&#39;t let me sign in using it but will let me use Localhost. Thanks.</description>
