    <title>A Few Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions/260188</link>
    <description>Hello there.

I have a few questions, and would appreciate any help you may be able to provide.

I am not a native English speaker; so my English isn&#39;t as a standard English fluentacy, so i&#39;ll make my apology now ^^

I am going away tomorrow, due to bad weather (snowing), flights are being delayed -_-;
^So i&#39;d appreciate a quick response, if you&#39;re not busy.

While i&#39;m away, I decided to use RSC server on a localhost, as i&#39;ll be far too busy to stay online to play a server; this way I can use it when i&#39;m free and also use for educational purposes, to get a real insight to the game, aswell as playing it.

Here are a few my questions; please correct any information that is incorrect.

I&#39;m using EasyRSC created by xEnt. I also have everything required to using RSCD_V25 too.

I basically want to know a few basic things, hope to add NPC&#39;s, make it possible to talk with an NPC; etc

1. Changing names of NPC&#39;s:- I&#39;ve been looking through and taking looks at xml document, and believe this is done in the NPCdef.xml

2. NPC drops/rates:- I believe this is done in NPCdef.xml also.

From looking through NPCdef.xml, I also can clearly see that here you can change the Hits, Strength, Defense and Attack of an Npc, also respawn rates of time. *The rest i&#39;ll not bother touching, as i&#39;m not 100% sure what will happen. With the drop rates, I am aware of the weight procedure, and will try a few things with that to get a decent drop rates.

3. Changing names of Items:- I believe by looking through ItemDef.xml, this is the correct place to change the name of an item.

4. Changing prices of shop items:- This is still quite unfamiliar to me. I see that in ItemDef.xml you have a &lt;basePrice&gt; x amount &lt;/basePrice&gt;, which i&#39;m thinking this would be the price when &quot;selling&quot; an item to the shop, not buying. Can anyone tell me where I can change the price of items that are already in-store.

5. Editing weapons/armours statistics:- I believe this can be done through Itemwieldabledef.xml, thanks to a great and informative tutorial that I read whilst looking through the search button.

6. Adding NPC&#39;s:- Also with this one, i&#39;m not entirely sure. It also gets into a little confusion of what to edit. I am thinking that if I want to create a &quot;new&quot; npc, I can do this also in NPCDef.xml, making it drop new things, altering it&#39;s statistics, etc. 

^I also believe i&#39;d have to create the NPC&#39;s locations in NpcLoc.xml. My question with this is: How do I make an NPC stay on 1 place, without moving. For example:- Would I just use all the same coords, like:-

[code]&lt;NPCLoc&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;100&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;startX&gt;555&lt;/startX&gt;
  &lt;startY&gt;666&lt;/startY&gt;
  &lt;minX&gt;555&lt;/minX&gt;
  &lt;maxX&gt;555&lt;/maxX&gt;
  &lt;minY&gt;666&lt;/minY&gt;
  &lt;maxY&gt;666&lt;/maxY&gt;
&lt;/NPCLoc&gt;[/code]

Of course I just added in any random numbers, but would that be how i&#39;d instigate making an NPC stick to 1 place, without movement?

After adding the NPC into NpcLoc.xml, I then noticed the file NpcHandlers.xml. More help on using the NpcHandlers.xml would be appreciated.

Ok, so to add in an NPC, all I need to change is &quot;NpcLoc&quot; and &quot;NpcHandlers&quot;.xml? -_-;

Also, if I can get an NPC into the game, in which file i&#39;m able to make him talk to a player when the player clicks the npc.

Any help is much appreciated and will be fully helpfully.

Take care and thanks in advance ^^

Regards,

~Yong-Min</description>

<p>Good luck</p>
