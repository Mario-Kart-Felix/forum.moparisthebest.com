    <title>A few questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions/353244</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
so I&#39;m trying to code my own server now.
It&#39;s delta based.
Well, I&#39;d be happy, if you could answer me all or atleast some of these questions.

1.) How can I add more playerRights + image in game, for example, playerRights 5 with a moderator crown, or a crown which I want to add myself

2.) How can I add new Npc, items, object etc, everywhere I read &quot;add the models&quot;, but where? o_O

3.) I downloaded a source named &#39;ParadiseX&#39;, and I have to use no-Ip if I want it to be online, I&#39;ve searched the port but didn&#39;t find it, does anybody know where it is? :)

4.) My gs specs are glitched, when I use a spec on a npc and run away, the gfx moves with me. &gt;.&gt;
Is there any way, that you cannot run while doing a spec or something like that? 

5.) Agility is glitched at my source, you cannot see the gnome course, and when I spawn the agility objects, you cannot go over it, I could simply add, that if you click on the object, that you&#39;re getting teleported to the other side of the object, but that&#39;s sad.

6.) The passwords in the character files aren&#39;t hidden, any ideas how to change that?

7.) I want to add a TempBan/TempMute/TempIpMute/TempIpBan command, which Bans/Mutes/IpMutes/IpBans a player for 2days, any ideas?


That should be enough at first, thanks guys! :)
I&#39;m happy to be a part of the Mopar-Scape community now. :)</description>

then you can change passwords ingame =) anyway if you open the coded player files in wordpad i see the passwords uncoded :P…</p>
