    <title>A Few questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions/160490</link>
    <description>1. How do i import a variable from another java file.
things i know about this so far:
-Function (method) must be able to return (void, will not work)

and how do i import all the variables from a .java file with only one class (public) and no functions

2. how do i make a if function something like this

[code]int x = 10;
int y = 30;
int z = 100;
if (exp == [b]inbetween [/b] x &amp;&amp; y);
if (level == 1);
level++;
if (exp == [b]inbetween [/b] y &amp;&amp; z);
if (level == 2);
level++;[/code]
things i know about this problem:
-yes i know inbetween wont work thats what im trying to figure out
- if(exp &lt;= y &amp;&amp; exp &gt;= x); wont work because that means every single number in existance!
- DO NOT worry about the int variables (the exp, and level) at all my server here is working a bit diffreant from what i remember.
(basicly just help out with the math problem here)

3. is there a maximum to the amount of coding in a class with no functions? (just pure variable .java file)</description>
