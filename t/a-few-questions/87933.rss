    <title>A Few Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions/87933</link>
    <description>Hey everyone I would like to ask a few questions.

(1) I have been thinking about learning the programming language Java, Is it worth it or should I learn something else?

(2) People have been saying the latest mIRC 6.21 is a virus. Is this true?

(3) At school I am going to get mIRC (We are allowed to get anything we want :cool: ) but my school has Mcafee 2006 and Windows Defender. How would I allow mIRC connect to the internet by letting it through those programs. My schools user accounts are Limited as far as I know and are running Windows XP Professional Version. I am thinking maybe the Windows Firewall could make an exception but with no access to the control panel (none that I know) and only access to My Computer and some others I don&#39;t see a way to get into control panel unless there is some sort of icon in C drive that allows you to get to the Control panel or some other way.


Thanks in advance  :)</description>

              <p>Lawl is right though, because java is better for many other things, besides RS cheating, and is also a good begginers language, or you could learn c#, because there is a lack of C# coders.</p>

              <p>1.) If you have no other knowledge in programming I wouldn’t personally recommend Java unless you are very ambitious. I would start out with something easier like <a href="http://sean.cruels.net/vb/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Visual Basics</a>.</p>
<p>2.) Already answered.</p>
<p>3.) I honestly don’t know because it varies from school to school, if you are actually allowed to install whatever you like then I would recommend asking one of the staff, otherwise search around on Google.</p>
