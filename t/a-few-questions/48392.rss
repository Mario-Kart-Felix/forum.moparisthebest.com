    <title>A few questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions/48392</link>
    <description>I now I might sound noobish, but this is my first time to edit a server, and I want to ask a few questions which I need help with.

1.How do I get other people to join my server? e.g. Where would they put my ip address to be able to conncet to it?

2.On the &quot;use this for admins&quot; and &quot;use this for new people&quot; do I change the username and password for my friends, or do I just leave it as it is?

I think thats it for now, but I will ask some more if I need any help, thank you.</description>

<p>Download hamachi or no-ip. No-ip us much butter, make your own ip for your server then advertise it.</p>
