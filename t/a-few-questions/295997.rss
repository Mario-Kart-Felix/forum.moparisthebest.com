    <title>A few questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions/295997</link>
    <description>1. In allstarscapev2 source, when you start it has a screen with a ton of messages on it... I was wondering how I can change some of it (I changed a little in client.java, but some I can&#39;t find in any place..)

I&#39;d either like to change it, or remove it.

2. I tried changing my home from the troll mountain base, to edgeville, and it doesn&#39;t seem to work. It keeps me starting off there no matter what. 

[img]http://i25.tinypic.com/wkst9f.jpg[/img]

And nothing happens. Those are the coords for edgeville bank. I compiled, twice.

3. Where do I place commands? I searched in client.java, and player.java for any currently existing commands and found nothing. (There&#39;s ::home, and crap, so I know there&#39;s some..)

4. Last Question. How do I place NPCs where I want them to be, and make them talk. If I&#39;m going to change the home, I can&#39;t have random NPCs everywhere...

Thanks to any and all help.  :rolleyes:</description>

<p>[/quote] Ok you’v set up the new home correctly, did you get any errors when compiling your server? If so thats probably the answer to most of your problems.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 18, 2009, 04:51:27 pm[/size][hr]1. Were you meaning the messages that come up in the chat box when you log in?<br>
If so, Open client.java and search for<code>if (playerRights == 0) {</code> Untill you find a couple lines of sendMessage (It should take about 2 seaches.) After you find that you change what is says in the (“EXAPLE”) this will only change what is says for players that log in that arnt part of the staff. Just scroll down till you see playerRights == 1 or 2 or 3, which ever one you are trying to change. If you don’t know- 1 is Mod 2 is Admin 3 is Owner, and 4 is Hidden. Sorry this is kinda hard to follow, i’m not an expert at explaining things. Hope this helped.  :)[/quote]</p>
<p>I got off allstarscape’s source. Mostly because I tried to add a command, it didn’t work out, I took it out, and upon compiling, I got 100 errors. ^^"""</p>
<p>I moved to Project Lmao-Scape Source… Which is based off of Allstarscape. Lol.<br>
I changed the home on this one just fine. Both of these problems = gone, basically.</p>

<p>I want to change where I start, and ::home. I tried working with commands earlier and kinda failed. ^^"…</p>
