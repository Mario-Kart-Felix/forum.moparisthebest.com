    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions/399587</link>
    <description>hello,
i was just woundering a few questions,
my questions are,
1.How do i add animations to npc&#39;s  for ex. make a man use the right attack emote istead of becomeing some odd messed up model when ever he/she walks or attacks? and no thats the the npc im having trouble with, i was just woundering for npc&#39;s in general.

2.How do i change my tele gfx&#39;s for my normal teleport spells, AND my ancients.

3.How do i Change where My teleport spells take me.

4. and finally, How do i Make my ice barrage gfx be right on the target npc instead of next to it? (i dont really care but it can be a lil annoying)

Info:: im using a 317 server,delta base i assume. and im not demanding for this help, if anyone can spare some time to point me in the right place for this stuff ill greatly appreciate it!</description>

              <p>well you solved question # 3 so thank you but as for <span class="hashtag">#1</span> i was just referring to normal rs monsters that are ment to be on a 317 server, like have you ever had a server where you attack like a goblin or something and when it hits you it streches everywhere and when it dies it like stretches in every direction? well thats what im trying to mostly solve, i want my servers animations to run smoothly, not willy nilly lol</p>
