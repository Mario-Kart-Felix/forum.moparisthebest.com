    <title>A few questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions/273810</link>
    <description>Ok sometimes when I am on the privite server I use ::pickup... and when I equip the Idem i loose connection and when it comes back up I am stuck.
2nd question How do I put in the IP address all they give u is something like pkftw.hopto.org or something and u got to put in something like 58.22.101.138 in the server IP spot.
How do u edit the NPC&#39;s?
And a lot of them times when I try the 58.22.101.138 it says its down a lot of the times and when I get on finaly ppl are on it.</description>

              <p>Pickup, on the server you use, may be disable.  If it’s not your server, you can’t fix that.<br>
File &gt; Server IP should change it, or most clients let you just click that line and backspace.<br>
NPC’s are in the server folder; multiple files, all depending on what you want to edit.<br>
58.22.101.138 Is not <span class="bbcode-i">always on</span> which is why it doesn’t work sometimes.  And when people are online and it does work, that means it’s on.</p>
