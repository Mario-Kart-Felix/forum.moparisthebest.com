    <title>A few questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions/107242</link>
    <description>Hi! 

Im sjoerd and im 12 years old. Please dont ban me on the forums because 
i can speak nice English and i want sure make an nice Pserver.
My questions are:

Q 1. My character attacks very strange. How i can fix this?
Q 2. How i set the make-over-mage so that she can change me into an girl?  ;) (It looks nice with Veracs)
Q 3. How i set the shop-weirdo&#39;s so that i can put my stuff into it? (Like in Varrock, that man who sell armours.
Can i put Dragon stuff or like that on it?)
Q 4. The mini-games, how you fix it?
Q 5. How you climb ladders? 
Q 6. Evry half-hour my server crashes. Its gets an connection error and i most make a new server. This is strange people. Anyone
know how to fix this?
Q 7. How do you let your NPC walk?
Q 8. How you open doors?

You can make an tutorial how i put the scripts on it, and you must post the codes. I 
hope you do it both. And please no **** virusses.

Thanks anyway for read this and very much thanks if you help me!  :cool:</description>
