        <p>Okay so i Have a server Called FantasyscapeX that me and another guy made the problem is he coded and knew how to do everything i just told him what needed to be done. So now i have absolutely no idea what im doing and i need help. I am a super noob at this and i have many question but im going to ask one at a time. He gave me all the files for the server because he could no longer work on it due to some choices he made. Anyhow i have the server and client file and also a thing called FantasyscapeXcache1. In that file it has the JFrame Sprites and all that other stuff that i would need to do things. I have been looking for awhile on how to add the cache folder to my server but i have no idea how to put it in. I read something that said i had to make a cache folder in Server &gt; Data. I did that so now it is Server &gt; Data &gt; cache and i added the FantasyscapeXcache1 in there and tried to edit something in the Sprites folder and i compiled it and nothing worked. Would someone please help me out on this?</p>
