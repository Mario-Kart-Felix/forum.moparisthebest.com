    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m at a big problem when getting started to create my first ever server.. I&#39;v followed hundreds of guides and didn&#39;t reach any successes, i&#39;v been playing RSPS for about 2 years. I dont have great knowledge on Java or Developing/Coding..  I have a 64 bit, win 7 computer with a SKY Router.. I have many problems when trying to make my very own server.. I dont like asking for help but it came down to this. I would just like to mention 2 of the problems. 

1st Problem:
When i try and run a .bat file on a source or client it always fails E.g Run, Compilers. i try editing them aswell to direct to my java but still it doesn&#39;t work. I have 7 different types of Java versions JRE6, JRE7, JDK 1.6.0.13.. etc.. Only thing works is .Jar files for me. 
Heres a screenie of when i try running a .bat file of a rsps source:

And when i try to edit it:

2nd Problem:
I cant port forward, i heard it is the biggest problem that people get when creating a server. I try anf get to my router page and it asks for a user name and pass.. I&#39;v got no idea what they are, i asked my dad and he didn&#39;t know either. I tryed putting &quot;Admin&quot; as a user like seen on other guides but it never lets me on the page.

I figured out that i can host with utorrent, and i was also wondring is this possible and does it work?

          <blockquote>
              <p>1st problem (compiler): It may say that because you do not have environmental variables set or you java is set into the wrong folder I believe with 64 bit windows 7 there is also a Program Files (x86) folder that may have some java it in. In additon, you could try using \java.exe" instead of javac.</p>
<p>2nd problem: Utorrent is possible for some routers but its bad for hosting why I say this is because it blocks the ports from you connecting onto the server. Also, Visit this tutorial for a setup on how to portforward your sky router <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,538695.msg3941766.html#msg3941766" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,538695.msg3941766.html#msg3941766</a></p>
