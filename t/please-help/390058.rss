    <description>Ok so i have been working on my 317 and i almost got it to what i want it to be. But then me being how i am at the last second didnt like the graphics. So i was looking for a more updated version (508,562 etc...) and i found a 562 that was called Element-X. So i was looking at it and it looked good so i was going to use it (btw Element-X is based off of Painzone but with a bunch of different stuff) because it looked good. So i downloaded it and everything and the client is saying &quot;error_game_js5connection&quot;. And i have heard it was many different things that causes it from Environmental Variables to it doesnt have the right IP. I have messed with my Environmental and changed the IP to anything it could be but it still doesnt work. ANYONE have an idea of how to fix? 
If you want to add me on msn or teamview me or something let me know. It would be greatly appreciated.
THANK YOU, T A N K ;)</description>

<p>Well i do Always run the server before the client and i am new at all this but you said “IP’s” is there more than one IP you have to change in the client.java file? Because it was 127.0.0.1 but i made a thingy on <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> and i changed 127.0.0.1 to the host on no-ip do i need to change it to something else or what?</p>
