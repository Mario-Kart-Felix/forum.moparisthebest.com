    <description>Hello people. I&#39;m using Galkon&#39;s client and I&#39;ve recently made some interface edits to it and etc.

Now i&#39;m using a blank Emulous base with it... but the prayer headicons don&#39;t work. I did Galkon&#39;s tutorial on r-s on loading them... but it messes up. Like if I click protect from melee it brings up protect from magic and etc.

Please help me! And if anyone could tell me which source I should use with this client, I&#39;d be very grateful!</description>
