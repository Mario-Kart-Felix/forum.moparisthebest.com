              <p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:2, topic:554685”]as I’m unfamiliar with delta, I don’t know the variable names… But the command would essentially be:</p>
<p><code>if(command.equalsIgnoreCase("emptybank")) {
    playerBank = new int[500];
    return;
}</code><br>
You would change “playerBank” to the correct variable for your player’s bank items, and the “int[500]” to the actual size of your bank.<br>
You will also need to use the refreshBank, or whatever is used in delta, in the event that someone uses the command while they are banking.<br>
This works because you’re setting the variable to it’s ‘default’ state. I.E: like when a player first joins (As they don’t start with items in bank - normally).</p>
<p>As for spawning items into the bank. That’d be a bit more complex as most servers usually have the method that adds the item to bank, also take it from the inventory (So you have to have it in inventory first).<br>
You would have to basically copy the method, remove the parts where it checks for the player’s items, remove the parts where it deletes the items, and then rename it to something more related to what it’s doing (like addNewItemToBank).<br>
From there you would basically copy the spawn item command, replacing the part that gives it to the inventory with your new method.[/quote]</p>
<p>[size=14pt]Thanks for help atleast someone who actually helps here.[/size]</p>
