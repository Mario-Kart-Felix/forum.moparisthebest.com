    <description>So being tired from real RS sucky updates i have decided to quit and make a private server. I downloaded my source code from here, modified it. I followed the tutorial that apparently everyone uses but when i try to connect from silab client or mopar it says error connecting to server. When i clicked runserver, i got the little message that i was online. Puzzled by this i tried 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and was able to connect. So seeing how i was able to connect from my own computer, something is blocking everything else. I added the port 43594 to be allowed through my firewall and i did portforward correctly, i think. Would the problem be in the portforward? Don&#39;t really know what to do, i have friends that want to connect so we can just pk for fun  :D so being the only one I cant do that  :eek: But playing the minigames has sadly been fun  :P</description>
