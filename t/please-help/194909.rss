              <p>Tryme, i have had the same problems, well the way to resolve it is to create a new character, delete the old (e.gâ€¦ like Tryme, you log on you log out, go to your character folder, copy the stuff you need to, then delete him, then create him again, then go to your character folder, and edit stats if you want to ok :)?</p>
