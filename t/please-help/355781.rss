    <description>hi i downloaded a client earlier and its what i have been looking for for ages, the only problem is it is laggy, not loads but its laggy and its getting kinda annoying, i dont think its my computer cause i have a decent grafics card and 3gb of ram with a dual core 2.88 ghz processor.
