    <description>On my server, I have a mystery box that obviously gives random items but they usually give more than 1 of each item to you. How can I make it that the player can only get one of the item. I&#39;ve added this but didn&#39;t work.On my server, I have a mystery box that obviously gives random items but they usually give more than 1 of each item to you.

[code]if(itemID == 4565 &amp;&amp; (playerHasItem(4565, 1) || playerCheckBank(4565, 1))) {
				sM(&quot;You already have Basket of Eggs.&quot;);
				break;
				}[/code]

I put this under [b]case 236[/b]. I&#39;m pretty sure thats not where I&#39;m supposed to put it but I don&#39;t know which case to put it in.</description>
