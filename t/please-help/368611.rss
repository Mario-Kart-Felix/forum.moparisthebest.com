    <description>ok i just started my very first server last night and i have been coding stuff like commands, npc autospawns, npcdrops and stuff like that but some of the codes i put in the server didnt seem to update or thats what i thought it was called. i thought after i put in a code i had to exit the server and client to &quot;update it&quot;. then i found out what i was supposed  to do was compile it. so i tried it and i got an error like &quot;javac: file not found *.java&quot; so i googled around for a few hours also went throught like 30 pages on this topic and found out that its something to do with the PATH environment variables..so i google around for another few hours and find out that that mean some files put themselfs infront of it or something and i need to fix the PATH so i went to SYSTEMproperties&gt;advanced&gt;environment variables and changed the PATH one to &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_21\bin&quot; and edited the compiler to
&quot;@echo off
title simple compiler
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_21\bin\javac.exe&quot; -cp . *.java
pause&quot;

then i try to compile it and i still get &quot;javac: file not found:*.java&quot;
also i looked through a bunch of folders untill i found the actual &quot;javac&quot; file i do have it on my computer. 

pleasseeeee help me ahah</description>
