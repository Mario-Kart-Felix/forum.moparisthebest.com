              <p>Like they said. Go through the download section and find a server that you like and suits what you want to have. Most servers though that are that coded already have an anti-leach and the ones that dont usually have a lot of coding needed or an error that resulting in a release. But for a beginner coder Delta or pi is your best first project. after a couple projects you will probably be able to find a better source after that. Or make your delta/pi really good as i’v seen some servers like that ,which were reallly nicely coded non glitchy/sketchy.</p>

              <p>Just choose something your comfortable with, people will try to tell you to program Hyperion, or RuneSource but in reality they use a much more advanced java concept than your regular PI or Delta server does.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">downloads section full of servers to choose from</a> you just need to find one you like. Just be forewarned, programming servers like Delta and project insanity have their definite benefits, however they can teach some horrible programming habits which can be hard to reverse.</p>
