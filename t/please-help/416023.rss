</aside>
<p>Everyone has to learn it sometime. Also, most of the community did not take a class on it, they learned through experience. I learned what I know from programming RSPS and taking small steps into Swing and other areas of the language, but by no means do you need to take a class to learn the language. It will help, sure.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Thread</span>: You can always make a development thread, but make sure to follow the guidelines. Learn the basics of java, such as datatypes, if-statements, switch-statements, etc. Then as you progress you can move onto more difficult things.</p>
