    <description>Well My friends were having all these problems on connection to server, so I searched all over the web on how to resolve, and by accident I changed the Cache name, and I want to switch it back and whatever I do it keeps downloading the wrong cache, so now its just giving me a awful error and I have no clue of fixing, any clue on how I can change the cache back to its original ? Because I tried in signlink/sprite and its killing me on figuring out how to fix it. Please Help ?</description>

              <p>[quote=“rossy319, post:2, topic:475784”]Can you please be more specific as to were you changed the cache name?</p>
<p>If you changed the actual folder cache name that is very simple go to my computer &gt; documents and settings &gt; then find cache and change name.</p>
<p>If it is client sided go to cachedownloader.java , gui.java , signlink.java and client.java and were it needs to be changed search it up and change![/quote]</p>
<p>I just ran threw all those folders and everything and nothing wasnt changed, so I ran the the client again after checking all that but I compiled it first, and now its perfectly working, thanks tho, you pointed out the obvious ha.</p>
