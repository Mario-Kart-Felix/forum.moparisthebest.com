    <description>Hello my name is Dave, ehm I used to have some RS PS several years ago and I thought it would be fun to have one again and work on it while re-learning the language. My problem is, I cant get the client open, it keeps saying it cant find the right path when I open it. I have tried to set the system variables, searched soms tuts, and I did everything in the vids but every video says something completely different. So know I probably have a very messy system variable settings or some kind. Some one could help me out? I have teamviewer so I would really appreciate if you could help guys :D.

Peace!</description>
