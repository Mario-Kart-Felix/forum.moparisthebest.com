    <description>Ok, i just got moparscape and i really really need some help cause im a noob and dont know wtf im doing. Ok i need a huge list of how to enter commands... everyone else has em but they way to complicated. If someone could show me a step by step tutorial with pictures and everything just to show me how to add stuff to the game([b]items, npcs, etc[/b]...) it&#39;d really help. Sorry that im asking this and annoying the hell out of all of you but, i would actually love to know how to add items and npcs to the game by commands. :(</description>
