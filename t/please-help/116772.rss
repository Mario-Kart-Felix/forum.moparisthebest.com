    <description>Please lock and tell me if this is in wrong area.

I have just released my server, and then two so called &quot;hackers&quot; logged onto my server.
They ended up somehow turning admin with a gold crown showing, then they kept kicking me on my own server!!! I idmediatly restarted my server, and Ip banned them.
One again they log on. They now say that selling admin/mod on my server was against the rules(please post if this is true), so i appologized, for i did not know. They now told me to turn them into and owner, or they would crash my server. I shut my server down, put my firewall up and went to bed.PLEASE POST ON HOW TO FIX THIS, and how did they even do this??</description>

              <p>Take away their modship to begin with so they cant kick you… best thing to do if they kick you ingame make an acc with random unrecognizable name and make it rights 4 so they can tell youre admin go in and right click ban or do ::banuser (hacker names here) most likely theyre not real hackers.</p>
