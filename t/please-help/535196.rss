    <description>I really want to find a way to get my server online without port-forwarding because i am unable to do so. I&#39;ve heard you can use hamachi (which i would be fine with) or there are a few other ways but everything i try just doesn&#39;t seem to work and for no clear reason either. I have two laptops and I can&#39;t seem to get a client on one laptop to run in a server being run by the other laptop. if anyone is good with hamachi or knows another way of getting a server online without portforwarding I could really use the help, I&#39;ve been trying to get this thing online on and off for the past few years. Please reply if you can help through teamviewer or skype</description>

<p>You have to have the hamachi server online at the same time as your server. And the players that connect also need to connect to your hamachi ip using hamachi. It’s a hassle.</p>

<p>Well I’ve done that, in fact right now i’m sitting here with my server running, and hamachi running on both computers. I have created a hamachi network on the laptop running the server which the other laptop has joined, yet when I try to connect to it tells me the server is offline. Any ideas? You’d think with all the tuts out there i could find a decent one but i can’t find anything that references this type of problem <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
