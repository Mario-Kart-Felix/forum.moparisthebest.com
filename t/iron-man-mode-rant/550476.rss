    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/iron-man-mode-rant/550476</link>
    <description>Iron-man wasn&#39;t made to be at half or less then the original server experience rate. 
In-case you didn&#39;t know what iron-man is: http://2007.runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Ironman_Mode
Here you go, thank-you. 

Is it bugging anyone else?</description>

<p>No where does it say people in “Ironman mode” cannot bank. You are thinking of <span class="bbcode-u">Ultimate</span> Ironman mode.</p>
<p>These are the restrictions for Ironman mode:</p>
<blockquote>Ironman players are not able to do the following:
<p>Trade with other players (except certain quest items from Shield of Arrav and Heroes Quest)<br>
Picking up drops from other players kills, including PvP<br>
No experience gain from Player-versus-player encounters (base magic experience from casting spells is still gained)<br>
See monster drops if the monster isn’t dealt 100% damage<br>
Accept Aid button is off and cannot be turned on<br>
Enter another players Player-owned house.<br>
Buy items from other players through shops<br>
Play the Fishing Trawler minigame<br>
Receive items via balloons in the Falador Party Room<br>
Staking in the Duel Arena<br>
Play Nightmare Zone (only solo mode, and cannot purchase resources from the reward chest)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimate ironman mode is everything in ironman mode, including:</p>
<blockquote>Furthermore Ultimate Ironman players are not able to do the following:
Receive resources from Managing Miscellania
Send their Servant to the bank or the sawmill
Use the banks of Runescape
Players who choose to activate Ultimate Ironman Mode, in addition to the standard Iron Man restrictions, will be unable to use a bank, but will be able to use noted items on bank booths to unnote them. They are also unable to create item sets using the trading post. In addition, Ultimate Iron Man players will also lose all their items upon death.</blockquote>
<p>Also, OP. Where does it say that they gain less than normal XP?</p>
