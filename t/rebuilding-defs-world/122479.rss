    <description>Hey everyone,
Most of you wont know or remember me but I previously ran the server &quot;DefsWorld&quot;.
It was good but it was lagging too bad so i decided to stop. Now im going to make a new defsworld server and if anybody is interested in hoasting or helping me code or anything then just say.

Thanks.  :cool:</description>
