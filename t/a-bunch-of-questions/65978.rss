    <title>A bunch of questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-bunch-of-questions/65978</link>
    <description>I believe Attack Bonuses don&#39;t do a thing on a PimpScape source since I tested +1000 and -1000 it didn&#39;t make much a difference if any.

So attack bonuses don&#39;t do anything either like defence?
And are mage attack bonuses the same way?
Is there a way - or a tutorial - to fix this?


and how can I make the ladders and stairs go down/up in Ape Atoll?
if you go up one, you can&#39;t go back down, then there&#39;s some you can go up from the place below ape atoll but you can&#39;t go down them.


How can I change a spell&#39;s name such as Wind Strike?


And my last thing is, since it was a requested item for shops, how can I fix the arms on woven tops, etc - because the body is normal but you still see your normal clothes arms instead of it&#39;s.

this is what it looks like:

This is what it&#39;s [i]supposed[/i] to look like:

as you notice, in the first pic - the body goes into the right spot so iuno how to fix it..

Help from any greatly appreciated :)</description>
