    <title>Opaque predicates</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/opaque-predicates/313447</link>
    <description>its pretty fucking pathetic how all of the deobfuscators that have been released publicly use the same method for the removal of opaque predicates, which is: identify the local var index in which the control field is stored in (ie istore_&lt;x&gt;), locate all instances of &#39;iload_&lt;control_field_idx&gt;, if&lt;eq/ne&gt;&#39; and replace with a goto

they identify the control field via something like: checking first instances of &#39;getstatic, istore&#39;, and revising the name and type of the field-to-be-retrieved, as well as its accessor flags checking to see if the field is a &#39;public static boolean&#39;

although this method of identification is fast, it is obviously unreliable, since, with a simply change in the client, jagex could fuck up all of the current opaque-predicate transformers. the best way (but slowest too) of identifying the control field would be to find the location(s) where the value of the field is set and trace back the call tree, to see if the value is truly constant throughout the invocation of the method; but since this method is long and annoying it would not be considered

the only time which i have seen that opaque predicates fuck up a method&#39;s flow in the client, to the point where jad would not be able to decompile properly, is when the set jump target of the opaque predicate would change the &#39;flow&#39; of a loop it is to execute. for example (from the client):
[code]   35:	iload	4
   37:	ifeq	82
   40:	iload_1
   41:	i2d
   42:	ldc2_w	#167; //double 255.0d
   45:	ddiv
   46:	ldc2_w	#165; //double 6.283185307179586d
   49:	dmul
   50:	dstore_2
   51:	getstatic	#380; //Field Login.j:[I
   54:	iload_1
   55:	ldc2_w	#169; //double 4096.0d
   58:	dload_2
   59:	invokestatic	#410; //Method java/lang/Math.sin:(D)D
   62:	dmul
   63:	d2i
   64:	iastore
   65:	getstatic	#394; //Field ss.Q:[I
   68:	iload_1
   69:	ldc2_w	#169; //double 4096.0d
   72:	dload_2
   73:	invokestatic	#409; //Method java/lang/Math.cos:(D)D
   76:	dmul
   77:	d2i
   78:	iastore
   79:	iinc	1, 1
   82:	iload_1
   83:	iconst_m1
   84:	ixor
   85:	sipush	-257
   88:	if_icmpgt	40[/code](local integer &#39;4&#39; being the control field)
in this method, you see that if the condition at line 37 is true, it would make the statement it is jumping to a for-loop, but if it is false, it would make it a do-while loop. both of them cant be possible, so flow is messed up, and this would cause jad to decompile erroneously

a possible way of removing only the opaque-predicates that cause jad to decompile with errors, would be to check if the jump-target of a &#39;iload, ifne&#39; condition is a loop, and if so, then the flow is obviously messed up, and it is an opaque predicate and you should remove</description>

              <p>Why is it pathetic?</p>
<p>IMO it’s simply a progression. Calling an algorithm that the public deobfuscators use ‘pathetic’ is, in my eyes, the same as calling a toddler pathetic because he/she cannot run a marathon yet.</p>
<p>That kind of talk is elitist jerkism. What have you done with the client really? Deobfuscated it? Created a couple scripted activities? I’ve grown to detest the drama. (thanks to ruler and jellodemon) and I really think it gets old fast.</p>
<p>I’ll be the first to admit that I’ve my own streak of elitism. But, you have not done what I have done with the game… yes I am quite sure of that.</p>
<p>In other words, you can be completely wrong while being right… just like you can be completely right while being wrong. It’s not the message you deliver, it is the fact that it’s your ass delivering it.</p>

<p>Abraham, dude, you’re bullshitting us and it’s annoying, this is your second thread where you ramble on with bullcrap. You’ve provided no CORRECT information, and only wasted our time here. Hey maybe that’s why you dont get how some of these things work, you just don’t understand the information already out there? My time, has proven continuously, that it is relatively worthless, but some of us actually come here, looking forward to the little gem’s of knowledge that sometimes shine through.</p>
<p>Do everyone a favor and take a stfu pill.</p>
<p>EDIT: false(0), really? Like we don’t know what false is… BTW, they’re not ALWAYS false, they’re sometimes true, and are even sometimes used as an inline constant replacement IN REAL CODE. Dude, JUST BE QUIET, you’re full of crap!</p>

in this method, you see that if the condition at line 37 is true, it would make the statement it is jumping to a for-loop, but if it is false, it would make it a do-while loop. both of them cant be possible, so flow is messed up, and this would cause jad to decompile erroneously</p>
<p>a possible way of removing only the opaque-predicates that cause jad to decompile with errors, would be to check if the jump-target of a ‘iload, ifne’ condition is a loop, and if so, then the flow is obviously messed up, and it is an opaque predicate and you should remove</p>
