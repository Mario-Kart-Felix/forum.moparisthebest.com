    <description>Alright so i took deathlypvpz removed all of the random player save methods &amp; added my own, right now everything works, i can give points with my command or take them away. they can also be used in the shop i have, the only problem i&#39;m having is saving, whenever a player log outs, the points i set, are reset. How can i fix this ? Would adding a save button work ?</description>
