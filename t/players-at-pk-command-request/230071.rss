    <title>Players at PK- Command request</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/players-at-pk-command-request/230071</link>
    <description>Hey guys, im a long time coder but I cannot think of ANY way to make this..

1st of all I wanted to make a line saying this any time people entered Pk.

&quot;+playername has endered PK! There are now (# of players) at PK!&quot;

Now I know this for the first part, 
[code]                PlayerHandler.messageToAll = &quot;User: &quot; + playerName + &quot; has just entered PK!! &quot;;[/code]

But how would I manage to add how many people are there?
Plz respond!

              <p>That would be quite a bit of work. But make a int named like peopleInWild or whatever. Then increase it along with the sendmessage and decrease it when they leave. (would also need to be for tele commands and teleports out of wild)</p>
