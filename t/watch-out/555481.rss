    <description>Hello guys,

Just posting this here so you all know.

The owners of Nexorth.com and nexorth.net, being Squad (aka Ragean) and Jazed don&#39;t have the best intentions.

Me and my fellow project admin found this out first hand.

It all start with them firing innocent DDoS attacks pointed to our webserver and vps, we reacted to that with a small pentest to their ips which stopped the attack right away.

Next up they start attacking our personal lifes, after which they also decided to hack my fellow admin on skype and starting trouble with his best friends. 

They also managed to find critical information such as vps passwords and others and hacked our site. Once they took everything from it, DDoS attacks were fired to our servers again so we couldn&#39;t do anything.

Like previously, they started attacking our personal lifes again same as launching their DDoS attacks at our personal IP addresses (good thing we had our home networks well protected).

I&#39;m growing kind of tired of their bullshit, which is why I&#39;m posting it here so you don&#39;t have to go through this aswell.

Kids be kids, I&#39;ll just let them do what kids do best.</description>
