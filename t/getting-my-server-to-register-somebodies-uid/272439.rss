    <title>Getting my server to register somebodies UID?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-my-server-to-register-somebodies-uid/272439</link>
    <description>This is what I&#39;ve done:

I went into signlink.java (in the client files) and found my uID.
I went into client.java (in the server files) and went to public void run()

I declared this:
		[code]int UID = inStream.readDWord();[/code]

Then, under where it does the returnCode for banned users I put:

[code]if (UID != *my UID*) {
                returnCode = 22;
                disconnected = true;
                LoggedOut = false;
                println(&quot;Player not using official client.&quot;);
            }[/code]

But it didn&#39;t let anyone log in!
SO, I removed that and put in something like

[code]println(&quot;&quot;+UID+&quot;&quot;);[/code]

and it turned out that the server was registering everyone&#39;s uID to be zero.
I tried logging in with multiple clients but it was ALWAYS zero.
Any suggestions?</description>

              <p>It is possible; believe me. I’ve seen it on other servers. Well, anyone else know the solution? I’ve also looked in stream.java and found</p>
<p><code>	public int readDWord() {
		currentOffset += 4;
		return ((buffer[currentOffset - 4] &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; 24)

sorry man! ok what I see what you mean. well since the server and the client are two different things… im not sure it is possible. but if there is some way you can go into the signlink file and edit the way you log in depending on the client… then thats my only shot of wisdom to you sir… sorry I could not help more.</p>

              <p>Nono, I don’t want to erase this problem; the reason they log in this way is because the Bluurrs client is configured to it. So if you log in with it; you won’t receive any of these problems.</p>

              <p>ok did you check the signlink files. its the file which dispalys log in detail. and in client.java look up/find “log in”.</p>
<p>I know this is vague sorry to say, but if you do find something try and edit it.</p>
<p>hey, besides the fact that its a server and nothing bad is really going to happen. I suggest trying to erase the client.java file (AFTER saving it on your desktop in a backup file) and compiling. Ofcourse, you will get the mother load of errors… BUT… copy and oaste your old server settings back in client.java and compile. then try logging in.</p>
<p>I had a major problem with log ins and object deleting/ adding… after I tried my own idea which is what I told you… everything was restored.</p>
<p>give it a shot.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=6" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>
