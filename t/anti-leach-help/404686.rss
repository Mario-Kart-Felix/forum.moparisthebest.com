    <description>So, i&#39;m trying to make my own AL (Not much of an AL). Here is how it works and what I did.

I created a file named &quot;Class_packet.java&quot; so it blends in with all the other files in my server.
And inside that file I write that the server was made by me. 
But then when it the server gets compiled, it gets an error because the java file is not in java code.
So then I tried putting &quot;misc.println(&quot;SERVER MADE BY FuZzIoN&quot;); &quot;
And sure enough, that didn&#39;t work so i might leave that and fix it later.
Anyway, When they delete the java file, the server wont run correctly. So thats sort of what i&#39;m trying to create.

Any ways on how I can make?
Thanks</description>
