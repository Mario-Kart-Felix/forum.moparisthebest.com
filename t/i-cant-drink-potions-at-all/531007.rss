    <title>I can&#39;t drink potions at all?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-cant-drink-potions-at-all/531007</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I am using Aggroth V2 as a base, and I have gotten very far. However, there is one fatal flaw. I cannot drink potions at all! In fact there are no packets being sent to the client. I can&#39;t show you the code now because I don&#39;t know what the problem might be. However, whatever you suspect the problem might be, I will happily give you the code for. Please help me, I am panicking right now. Thank you guys!

Sincerely,

LunarParadise</description>

</aside>
<p>No, potions were originally broken. Btw, I am using Aggroth V2, and I have not touched any Potions files AT ALL. But it might be in the clickitem class, because that’s where the potion drinking lies, etc.</p>

              <p>And when I first got the server it was like that. However after making MANY good changes to the server, this just popped up and now it’s frustrating! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> But I can eat food, etc. I tried taking my potions.java file from my other server and putting it on there, and still nothing, so it’s not something with the Potion.java it’s something else.</p>
