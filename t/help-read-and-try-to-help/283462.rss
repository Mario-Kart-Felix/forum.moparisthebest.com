    <description>Hello everyone, I did post this a while ago, but nobody actually helped or replied
so here it is
On my client there is a big runescape logo at the top, someone told me to use a suite cache editor.
But it asks me to upload the cache where is my cache?
It may seem stupid but, i clicked the folder for my source and tried it but didn&#39;t work and the same as for the client folder.
and I&#39;d also like to know how to delete the flames and change the login box on the client.
Thanks!

BTW in  the attachment, that is the background I set myself it was different. so please don&#39;t tell me to change it and the logo goes away.</description>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

              <p>ok do this to get rid of the flames</p>
<p>in client.java search for this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">anIntArray851 = new int[256];       starting at that line, comment that line through and including</code></pre>
<p>remove that.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">for(int j4 = 0; j4 &lt; 64; j4++)
            anIntArray853[j4 + 192] = 0xffffff;</code></pre>
<p>To change the login box try searching for sprites in the folder probably will find it then look for the current log in box and replace it with ur make sure it’s got the same name tho.</p>
