    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shop-sell-and-buy-option-317-pi/550557</link>
    <description>i have tryed everything, i am trying to make one of my shops on my server to only sell things and not buy items from players. i have tryed all the combinations of of putting 1 1 and 2 2 and etc.. but everything i do this it does not work. to be specific this is the pk point shop, you are able to buy items from it with pk points but you are also able to sell things to it for cash. im trying to make it to where the pk point shop only can sell you items for pk points and not buy things for cash. i have tryed many things any one have any ideas why it doesn&#39;t work? thank you.</description>
