<p>As for your problem, if you are connecting local host (on the same computer as is hosting the server), just use the ip 127.0.0.1 (localhost) for connecting to your server.

<p>Did you just attempt to insult someone that knows more about programming, rsps, pretty much anything, by commenting the same thing and still not grasping the comment behind it? You can’t re-portforward something. You do realize it just opens up a port, or range of ports that allows connections outside of your computer, to by pass the fire wall. So can’t reopen something that is already open. Your server stop connecting would most likely match with your lack of knowledge on just about everything. Which would then correlate to you either not writing networking properly, or the framework that you are doing your rsps on, is complete shit.</p>
<p>If you would love to try and show me that you know more then me, I would love to have a refactor challenge on the newest protocol of runescape’s client. Since that applies to runescape and I believe that having any sort of programming challenge with you, would just be a waste of time on my part. As it is clear you don’t have a simple grasp on any aspect of a language.</p>

<p>You just rephrased what I said after noting that you said &gt; 43594 was not to be portforwarded lmao. If you think java is the only language I know, then you are fairly uneducated on that topic. As java has nothing to do regarding the original post, I don’t see why you are bringing that up. I only posted that snippet to show you that calling me stupid was a dead end.</p>

<p>re-portforward…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If only you knew what you were talking about before posting.</p>
<p>As for your problem, if you are connecting local host (on the same computer as is hosting the server), just use the ip 127.0.0.1 (localhost) for connecting to your server. You don’t have to use a masked ip such as no-ip to connect to your server. It is only for computers outside of your computer that have to.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>re-portforwarding always works for me when, my server stops connecting to my friends, so “you” obviously don’t know what you’re talking about, kaay<br>
Good-bye :D.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Did you just attempt to insult someone that knows more about programming, rsps, pretty much anything, by commenting the same thing and still not grasping the comment behind it? You can’t re-portforward something. You do realize it just opens up a port, or range of ports that allows connections outside of your computer, to by pass the fire wall. So can’t reopen something that is already open. Your server stop connecting would most likely match with your lack of knowledge on just about everything. Which would then correlate to you either not writing networking properly, or the framework that you are doing your rsps on, is complete shit.</p>
<p>If you would love to try and show me that you know more then me, I would love to have a refactor challenge on the newest protocol of runescape’s client. Since that applies to runescape and I believe that having any sort of programming challenge with you, would just be a waste of time on my part. As it is clear you don’t have a simple grasp on any aspect of a language.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Also enjoy a – for your stupidity.</p>

</aside>
<p>you obviously don’t understand what i’m saying, Just delete the ports and add them again you know “Any &gt; 43594” delete that, you’re such and idiot, and you’re calling me stupid. Check your self before you reck yourself, because you just made yourself look idiotic.</p>
<p>Good DAy</p>

<p>Lol you do realize you don’t have to use 43594. You can use any port you want, as long as it isn’t already used by a different application. If I was you, I would just stop commenting, you are making yourself look more like a mongoloid with each word.</p>

<p>re-portforward…</p>

</aside>
<p>If only you knew what you were talking about before posting.</p>
<p>As for your problem, if you are connecting local host (on the same computer as is hosting the server), just use the ip 127.0.0.1 (localhost) for connecting to your server. You don’t have to use a masked ip such as no-ip to connect to your server. It is only for computers outside of your computer that have to.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>re-portforwarding always works for me when, my server stops connecting to my friends, so “you” obviously don’t know what you’re talking about, kaay<br>
Good-bye :D.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Did you just attempt to insult someone that knows more about programming, rsps, pretty much anything, by commenting the same thing and still not grasping the comment behind it? You can’t re-portforward something. You do realize it just opens up a port, or range of ports that allows connections outside of your computer, to by pass the fire wall. So can’t reopen something that is already open. Your server stop connecting would most likely match with your lack of knowledge on just about everything. Which would then correlate to you either not writing networking properly, or the framework that you are doing your rsps on, is complete shit.</p>
<p>If you would love to try and show me that you know more then me, I would love to have a refactor challenge on the newest protocol of runescape’s client. Since that applies to runescape and I believe that having any sort of programming challenge with you, would just be a waste of time on my part. As it is clear you don’t have a simple grasp on any aspect of a language.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Also enjoy a – for your stupidity.</p>

</aside>
<p>you obviously don’t understand what i’m saying, Just delete the ports and add them again you know “Any &gt; 43594” delete that, you’re such and idiot, and you’re calling me stupid. Check your self before you reck yourself, because you just made yourself look idiotic.</p>
<p>Good DAy</p>

<p>Lol you do realize you don’t have to use 43594. You can use any port you want, as long as it isn’t already used by a different application. If I was you, I would just stop commenting, you are making yourself look more like a mongoloid with each word.</p>

<p>As for your problem, if you are connecting local host (on the same computer as is hosting the server), just use the ip 127.0.0.1 (localhost) for connecting to your server. You don’t have to use a masked ip such as no-ip to connect to your server. It is only for computers outside of your computer that have to.</p>

<p>Did you just attempt to insult someone that knows more about programming, rsps, pretty much anything, by commenting the same thing and still not grasping the comment behind it? You can’t re-portforward something. You do realize it just opens up a port, or range of ports that allows connections outside of your computer, to by pass the fire wall. So can’t reopen something that is already open. Your server stop connecting would most likely match with your lack of knowledge on just about everything. Which would then correlate to you either not writing networking properly, or the framework that you are doing your rsps on, is complete shit.</p>
<p>If you would love to try and show me that you know more then me, I would love to have a refactor challenge on the newest protocol of runescape’s client. Since that applies to runescape and I believe that having any sort of programming challenge with you, would just be a waste of time on my part.

</aside>
<p>If only you knew what you were talking about before posting.</p>
<p>As for your problem, if you are connecting local host (on the same computer as is hosting the server), just use the ip 127.0.0.1 (localhost) for connecting to your server. You don’t have to use a masked ip such as no-ip to connect to your server. It is only for computers outside of your computer that have to.</p>

</aside>
<p>re-portforwarding always works for me when, my server stops connecting to my friends, so “you” obviously don’t know what you’re talking about, kaay<br>
Good-bye :D.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Did you just attempt to insult someone that knows more about programming, rsps, pretty much anything, by commenting the same thing and still not grasping the comment behind it? You can’t re-portforward something. You do realize it just opens up a port, or range of ports that allows connections outside of your computer, to by pass the fire wall. So can’t reopen something that is already open. Your server stop connecting would most likely match with your lack of knowledge on just about everything. Which would then correlate to you either not writing networking properly, or the framework that you are doing your rsps on, is complete shit.</p>
<p>If you would love to try and show me that you know more then me, I would love to have a refactor challenge on the newest protocol of runescape’s client. Since that applies to runescape and I believe that having any sort of programming challenge with you, would just be a waste of time on my part. As it is clear you don’t have a simple grasp on any aspect of a language.</p>
