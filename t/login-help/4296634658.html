<p>Did you just attempt to insult someone that knows more about programming, rsps, pretty much anything, by commenting the same thing and still not grasping the comment behind it? You can’t re-portforward something. You do realize it just opens up a port, or range of ports that allows connections outside of your computer, to by pass the fire wall. So can’t reopen something that is already open. Your server stop connecting would most likely match with your lack of knowledge on just about everything. Which would then correlate to you either not writing networking properly, or the framework that you are doing your rsps on, is complete shit.</p>
<p>If you would love to try and show me that you know more then me, I would love to have a refactor challenge on the newest protocol of runescape’s client. Since that applies to runescape and I believe that having any sort of programming challenge with you, would just be a waste of time on my part.

<p>You’re an idiot, you don’t have to use “43594” silly willie. You can use ports like “6112”, “5555” “43593”, “80”… etc… theres a lot more…<br>
so don’t put words in my mouth, or rather text on my keyboard.</p>
<p>“oh I’m pure slay am the best java coder in the world.” Calm down, stop giving yourself head.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You just rephrased what I said after noting that you said &gt; 43594 was not to be portforwarded lmao. If you think java is the only language I know, then you are fairly uneducated on that topic. As java has nothing to do regarding the original post, I don’t see why you are bringing that up. I only posted that snippet to show you that calling me stupid was a dead end.</p>

<p>You’re an idiot, you don’t have to use “43594” silly willie. You can use ports like “6112”, “5555” “43593”, “80”… etc… theres a lot more…<br>
so don’t put words in my mouth, or rather text on my keyboard.</p>
<p>“oh I’m pure slay am the best java coder in the world.” Calm down, stop giving yourself head.</p>

<p>You just rephrased what I said after noting that you said &gt; 43594 was not to be portforwarded lmao. If you think java is the only language I know, then you are fairly uneducated on that topic. As java has nothing to do regarding the original post, I don’t see why you are bringing that up. I only posted that snippet to show you that calling me stupid was a dead end.</p>
