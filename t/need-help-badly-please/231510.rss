    <description>ok first off i got everything i need but when i got to press compile it says this:

&#39;&quot;c:\Program Files\Java\Java\jdk1.6.0_01\bin\&quot;&#39; is not reconized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
Press any key to continue . . .





What does it say that? and also when i press runserver. it says this


&#39;java&#39; is not reconized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

The system cannont find the path specified.
Press any key to continue.





Should i have changed it becuz first it was &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_01\bin\&quot;  -cp . *.java
pause


and now i changed it to &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_01\bin\javac.exe&quot;  -cp . *.java
pause



Should i change it back to the first one or is there something else i need to do</description>
