    <description>What the fudge did you just fudgeing say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Jagex Academy, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret Moparscape Hacks, and I have over 300 confirmed reputation. I am trained in Java and I’m the top Batch Scripter in the entire Moparscape Forum. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fudge out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fudgeing words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fudgeer. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the perma ban, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re items will be duped, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can hack your server in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my packet tools. Not only am I extensively trained in runescape packet manipulation, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Silab hack tools and I will use it to its full extent to duplicate items on your miserable attempt at creating an MMORPG , you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fudgeing tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Your server is going to be hacked, kiddo.</description>
