    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/market-failure-solutions/53870</link>
    <description>Hey, i&#39;m doing A levels atm in second year. But i&#39;ve got this really annoying task presentations in which i have to do.

Basically i have to found out the &quot;Remedies of Market Failure&quot;, like the solutions of market failure. I been searching website for information, but it only tells me info about market failure, not solutions to it.

Here are the reasons for market failures - 

    * Monopoly*
    * Monopsony
    * Oligopoly
    * Cartel
    * Oligopsony
    * Monopolistic competition
    * Price discrimination
    * Price skimming


Anyone shed any light ... ?

Thanks...man A2 is annoying...</description>
