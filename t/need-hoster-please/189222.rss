    <title>Need hoster please!</title>

    <description>Well, 

1st off...
You get Co-Owner if you host it,
2nd...
you get to become good friends with me :)
3rd... 
you&#39;re helping me + alot of other people out!

Well here is my story... 
I use to be able to host my own servers, edit my own servers, until one day my parents got a new router, and now i can&#39;t host anymore! i can still edit, which i find really fun. I just can&#39;t host, So heres how the server is... It&#39;s based off of Project Czar, I edited alot of it, It has working specs, veng, barrage, almost every silab item, and i fixed pretty much everything, and, you can train mage with a Lever now! i made that because when ever i played project czar i would always have to buy like 1k runes, then the server shuts off, well not anymore brother! because i made a ::runes command also! :)
So anyone who would like to host a pretty fun server, then add me on msm...
