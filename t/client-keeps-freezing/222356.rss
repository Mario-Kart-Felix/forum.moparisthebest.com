              <p>so if i wanted to make a client and use figmentscape then i would have to configure the client or source to each other?</p>
<p>then if so tell me a good source w/ client that is almost like figmentscape like not alot of stuff that can b easily editted</p>

              <p>Lol this happens to me,when u use someone client that is for a specific server it dosn’t have all the silab items and there could be so many nulls that it can freeze it…or the server ur on with the dif client might have some edited items that lag you out.</p>
<p>i recomend you use silabs at <a href="http://www.client.silabsoft.org" rel="nofollow noopener">www.client.silabsoft.org</a> if u didnt know…</p>
