    <title>Where Should I Put Codes?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-should-i-put-codes/117122</link>
    <description>Ok, I am brand new to this, seriously new to this and I need to find out where to put codes.

I search everywhere but I am not sure where I actually put codes to make it happen lol

I was also wondering how you make people spawn somewhere, like in RS you log in and you go to Lumbridge, I want mine in Varrok.

Thank you! By the way, I am working on a project and I know a lot of you people are amazing at this stuff, and I was wondering if someone could be co-creator, just PM me okie dokie

Thank you so very much!</description>

              <p>well, i’m just like u i’m new to this, but… i think that u go to client.java  to change like what the server says and stuff, and to change where the people are, you go to players.java i think and you can also change what they wear too from player.java. if you want i can help you creat it (i’m still training too)</p>
