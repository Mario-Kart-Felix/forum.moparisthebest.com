    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/allstar-reaperxscape-new-progression-thread/515948</link>
    <description>Hey guys, im here to tell you about my server, not advertise it but show you how its going first of all, because im not even hosting it yet its just in beta mode [still being coded, so it will be the #1 allstar (hopefully)]

before everything else... i want to say that the name ReaperXScape was my idea, and i know that theres already a server with the same name, i noticed that like 2 weeks after i renamed my server.. fml... 
so the name doesnt really matter right now i guess, i think i will probably change it later on. 

ok so heres some features before i add the pictures!

-new funpk! when you kill somebody at funpk they lose no items, and they will drop a good random item, or bones (more then likely)
-every 20 minutes ingame you automatically receive 1gp - 200mgp
-jar client (easy to use)
-made awesome quest tab
-quest tab features : 
[bosses] &lt;&lt; click on this and it will show you the boss options with the boss maxhits!
[boss drops] &lt;&lt; find this from [bosses] tab, it will show you the items the bosses drop
[quests] &lt;&lt; wow! quests??? 4/7 quests made!
[commands] &lt;&lt; click the words in the tab to do the command
[shops] &lt;&lt; easyer then going to ::shops and looking for the shit you need

-random events (being worked on) every couple mins, a random event comes, to stop stupid auto clicks!
-new home area
-yell titles (::titles to see the list ingame)
-made antiSYI to block nulls/crashes or whatever SYI is...
-working clan chats
-when you kill a boss and get an item (except coins or bones) it sends a message to all players online of the drop!
-working bank pins (they just dont save, i messed up my saving methods (being worked on))
-made 4 quests [the noclip tragedy], [the blood diamond], [the ice diamond], [excalibur ownage].
-void minigame -90% creds to owner of futurescape!
-working dices (50x2, 70x3, 85x5)
-dicer npc, enter the amount of 1b tickets to bet!
-rares area! (drops are shouted to all players)
-skill exp lamps (gives lvl 125 in random skill)
-working and accurate boss drops (works for all bosses)
-whenever you achieve lvl 125 in a skill, you get a mystery box (mystery box gives a random custom)
-when you kill the custom dropping boss, he drops a custom 1/15 chance, so its rare
-added super boss (drops pumpkin and rogue armour)
-pumpkin heals 125 hp, and you can use infinity times (rare drop and super hard!)
-rogue armour = very strong and when you wear the whole set you get + 150 maxhit
-spined armour gives +120 maxhit
-bandos, skeletal and armadyl armour sets being worn give bonus maxhits also
-no more shops for bandos or armadyl
-bandos armadyl and all other strong items are obtained from bosses
-no more rares shops, rares are collectibles and not sellable to shops!
-click the skills box on skills tab for quick chat skill levels!

~~~~glitches fixed~~~~~
-fixed blood rune glitch for drop dupes

-fixed trade dupe
-fixed all other dupes (as i know of)

-fixed the Badnames glitch (you could use names with symbols before)

~~~source improvements~~~
-made new class MessagePlayers to handle automatic messages sent to players
-made new class RandomEvents to handle the random events
-added new class AntiSYI to block SYI
-.cfg files are now all inside a new folder called &quot;cfg&quot; (helps organisation)

hey guys, im trying to make my allstar server super awesome! and now i have come up with an idea.
i am using the music tab to make a clan chat (kindof like what normal 317&#39;s have) so you can chat in private!
if you want to help just pm me! *you will receive credits* 

current progress on clan tab (Approx) : 60%

*Newest Updates Posted under here*
-Added Censored Yell (no advertising or swearing)
-client class size : 1119 kb (119 kb left to go!)
-added prestige! (reset attack strength defence and hitpoints to get prestige up!)

what does prestige do? it resets your combat skills and adds a prestige to your account,  for each prestige point you have, your maxhit is boosted a certain amount, this is how it boosts your maxhit : 
your current maxhit + prestige amount times 20 = maxhit
that means if you had 5 prestige, your maxhit would be Current Maxhit + 5X20</description>
