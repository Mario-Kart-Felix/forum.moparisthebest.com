    <description>Hi,
  Well I haven&#39;t played moparscape in FOREVER, and I might have forgotten some stuff. I was trying to get my server running, and it worked. It let me get on, but when I tried to get on with the ip it didn&#39;t work. These are the steps I did:

1) Go to No-Ip.com.
2) Make a host.
3) Updae it on No-Ip DUC.
4) Went to Firewall.
5) Added the port at Firewall\Exceptions.
6) Compiled server.
7) Run server.

  After all that is still doesn&#39;t work. Can anyone help me?</description>
