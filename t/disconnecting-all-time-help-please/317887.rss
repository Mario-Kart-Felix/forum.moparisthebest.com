    <title>Disconnecting all time. Help please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/disconnecting-all-time-help-please/317887</link>
    <description>I run my server. All is ok untill everybody get disconnected of my server and then they can&#39;t get on it. This can happend when ever. I&#39;m tired of that. So when they disconnect, they try to log on but it says &quot;Error Connecting To Server&quot; but on Status Checker, it says &quot;Online&quot; all time even if people can&#39;t get on.

Can anyone help me please ? :(

Thanks.</description>
