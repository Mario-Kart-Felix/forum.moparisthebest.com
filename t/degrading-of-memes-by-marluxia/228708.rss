    <description>Originally posted on io9Labs:

A meme is a idea that can be easily conveyed to other people. It may be a image or a phrase just whatever gets the point through. Memes start out small starting amongst small groups. Generally these &quot;small groups&quot; are usually the elitists of the community (internet), the &quot;lesser peons&quot; of the community catch on to the meme and spam it around to others. These &quot;peons&quot; start feeling like they are apart of something as if it was some kind non-conformist club (fight club). The more popular a meme gets, the more people will join using that meme (leading to a repeating cycle). As the meme grows bigger it tends to lose meaning as the original context has long been lost as well as the event on which the meme was based on may of happened months or even years beforehand. Also some memes which contexts are lost may become serious such as in the case of &quot;rickrolling&quot; which started as a &quot;humorous trap&quot; but as it gained popularity people started taking it way to serious with their flashmobs and &quot;fucking dancing to that shit&quot;. So now months later we end up with a dead meaning to which is only said out of a new fight club mentality. This is the degrading of memes.
