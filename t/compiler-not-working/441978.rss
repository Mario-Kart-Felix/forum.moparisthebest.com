    <title>Compiler not working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compiler-not-working/441978</link>
    <description>Ive recently downloaded the &quot;Hybris&quot; source and client, and found out that the compiler does not work. Ive made a few updates, then compiled them, and it looked like it works, but when i went to try it out it didn&#39;t compile. I changed a simple command, to another work just to check if i had messed up what i added into the commands, and it still didnt work. If anyone can help i&#39;d really appreciate it. 
-- Thanks.


If your a good coder and you can just help me out over teamviewer pm me please.</description>
