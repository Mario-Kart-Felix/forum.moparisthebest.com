    <description>Well every server online seems to be down or something is wrong with some folder or something of mine so I can only make my own server which is kinda boring.(mind you i am a complete noob at programming and coding so dont make it too complex)

Im sorry if this question has already been answered but I couldnt really be bothered going through over 800 pages looking for it if thats fine with you guys.

Thanks.[br][size=1]Posted on: July 07, 2007, 10:04:24 AM[/size][hr]Nevermind, I saw a guy has made a topic exactly of this problem, so answer his or answer mine.</description>
