    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/depressing/326764</link>
    <description>Something that really depresses me is when i see a &#39;ghost forums&#39; in which someone has not posted in for about a year.

Example:
http://bubbyscape69.smfforfree3.com/index.php (My old favorite server, you can still see my posts there xD [[url=http://bubbyscape69.smfforfree3.com/index.php/topic,247.msg1522.html#msg1522]i was 9 :([/url]])

What depresses you moparfags?</description>

<p>The Bible says that healing requires a patient, and a healer (sometimes the Holy Spirit, not a person).</p>

<p>That is somewhat true. You will never see it for yourself if you do not believe it can happen.</p>

<p>It was such an inaccurate representation of my argument I did not fell a need to respond.</p>

<p>Healers are missionaries, but missionaries are not always healers.</p>

<li>
<p>Did I ever once say that everyone is healed? My grandma on my dads side was predicted to live for two more weeks, and 3 years later she is still alive. Doctors call it a miracle. Are you saying you have never heard of something like that? And my grandpa on my moms side had a stroke, and died later.</p>

There’s no point in trying to convince us that what you say is true, because you don’t have any proof, whatsoever, and furthermore, there’s never been proof of this, ever.</p>
<p>Also, show us proof that they actually need these magical missionary healers, unless you’re just talking out of your ass, right? You must’ve got this information from somewhere. And if you say from your relatives…</p>
<p>You said that my uncle never seen it in Africa because he never believed in it… what? So you’re saying that people can regrow limbs, but if you don’t believe in God then you don’t see or will never hear anything about those people whom magically regrew their limbs.</p>
<p>Did you like my summation of your argument? Because clearly you have nothing to say about that.</p>
<p>You were talking about healers and missionaries and all that bullshit, and Reaper said they bring cameras to document this stuff, but according to the all knowing you, they don’t? (ps. you said yourself ‘healers’ ARE missionaries)</p>
<p>“If you have faith, then you DO see what happens. You follow your faith even though you have seen it for real. You confirm your faith.”<br>
Let me tell you, you’re stepping a very fine line here, faggot. My grandma has Alzheimer’s (a non-reversible deteriorating disease) along with heart problems, she’s the biggest Catholic advocate I’ve ever seen, she wakes up, she prays, during the day, she prays, at any time, she prays. Explain to me why she hasn’t been cured of anything? Her faith is considerably bigger than some fucking Africans faith that wants to get better and go fuck some more to spread aids. [obviously i’m stretching this harshly, but apparently everyone in africa can regrow their limbs if they want]</p>
<p>edit: I seriously thought you’d be done after what everyone posted when you took your hiatus, but nope, you keep coming back with more… nothing.</p>

<p>But it depends on your view on the matter (the matter itself makes a difference as well). Even though things (of the supernatural or not) can be scientifically proven, it may not change the way one may see things because of their strong faith in what they believe in.</p>

i think his point is that there are millions of faithful people on earth, it so why hasn’t it occurred firstly, and secondly if it has occurred why is there no proof.</p>
<p>Btw man, i agree with you that faith is believing without seeing.</p>
<p>spent a few minuted googling it and it looks like it would be possible.<br>
