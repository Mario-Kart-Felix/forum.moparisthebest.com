    <title>Makeup Love: The thrilling ending to the story!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/makeup-love-the-thrilling-ending-to-the-story/340635</link>
    <description>As Mrs. Hunter prepared to enter the door to her house, old age swept over her. She had been so mistreated by Hunter the past few months. What had gotten into him? Was she not still his love? She still loved him...oh well, at least it would be over when the divorce went through.


She entered, and set her shopping bags down on the table. Ignoring Hunter&#39;s lazy figure, she went upstairs to put on some makeup. When she got to her medicine cabinet, she instead opened the cabinet below. A survivor was lying there, its tongue cut out and its vocal cords useless from all the screaming.


She bent down and tore open its pants. She ripped off the underwear, revealing its scabbed and bruised penis. The survivor started struggling to break free of the bonds that tied it. She reached down and grabbed the misshapen penis, feeling the survivor&#39;s heartbeat echoing inside its genitals.


She started to thrust on the penis, ripping off scabs as she did so. The survivor was bruising profusely, blood pouring out of holes in great quantities. This made her smile. When the survivor was hard, she gently stuck one claw inside its urethra. It whimpered in terror, knowing what was coming next. She thrust her claw up and down inside the urethra, blood pouring out more the faster she did it. Suddenly, with a jolt, the survivor began to cum. She leaned forward, allowing the cum to splash all over her face. Adjusting the cum into an acceptable position, she now had her makeup on. She closed the cabinet, and went downstairs.</description>
