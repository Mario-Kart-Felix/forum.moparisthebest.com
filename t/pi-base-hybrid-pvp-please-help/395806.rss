    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-base-hybrid-pvp-please-help/395806</link>
    <description>okay well, I downloaded Hybrid-pvp that has a PI base and i need help changing some things.  First, the torva is bugged and it messes up client when i spawn it and it says something about itemdef.java. and also when i fight an npc the hp bar goes red then goes back up to full, it does that with some of the npcs how can i fix this?  and How come i cant compile!! I&#39;ve went to the java websites and it says i have the 24 version or whatever and it keeps saying system cannot be found or specified when i compile, i&#39;ve tried everything! please help, so that i can see if there are any errors when i code some things</description>

<p>Ok with torva i have used that base before and for the helm i believe it is 13362 let me know if that works i dont know if you are coding it in again? Im not sure about the hp bar it never happened to me and with the compiling just go to your compiler and edit it and see if it says like instead of Program Files like Program Files (x86) or something or even just Program i have ran into that one alot but let me know if you still need any help after checking those.</p>
