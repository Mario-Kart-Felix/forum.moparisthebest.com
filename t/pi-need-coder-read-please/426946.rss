[size=18pt]if your reading this please comment, i hosted this and once had 150+ players on and it was amazingly fun but im unable to get alot of players now a days so hopefully you can do better getting players than I did. Credits to Me and Underoath for this. Me and him both developed the source and when he quit I kept it going.[/size]

Foreverpkers is probably the most successful using my base :) Gratz to them with 100+ always on! Thats insane!

Server is Project Insanity Based

Features:

Fight Pits: ::pits
Barrows: ::barrows
Home is edge and dark mage can tele you to pking spots
Great shops around edge
Ranks: Normal Player, Donator, Super Donator, Mod, Admin
::yell for Donator+
::yelltag (then tag) for super donators
Super donators can spawn by doing ::claws, ::chaoticrapier, ::chaoticmaul, ::chaoticlongsword, ::chaoticstaff
^^ Economy doesnt get ruined by this because those items dissapear when you die pking
Specs for Claws, vesta longsword, statius warhammer, and all godswords work
Many Non-cb skills added
::master and ::setlevel (lvl id) lvl for all players
So much more I cant even remember!
