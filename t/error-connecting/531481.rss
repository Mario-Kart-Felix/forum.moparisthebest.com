    <title>Error Connecting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting/531481</link>
    <description>So I recently started working on my own private server. I use to have one a long time ago, And I thought I still remembered how to do everything, but apparently I have forgot something. 
My only problem is that I can get on my server and play fine. Everything works for me. But my friends can&#39;t log in on there computers.
And before you ask.. Yes, I have protforwarded. I even checked the status of the server on Runelocus. It says my server &quot;is ONLINE and playable&quot; 

Are these the only codes you have to edit in your client files for it to connect to the server?
Client.java:
[code]public static String server = &quot;SERVER IP GOES HERE&quot;;[/code]
[code]server = &quot;SERVER IP GOES HERE&quot;;[/code]

And do I need to change this in Gui.java to my server ip or just 127.0.0.1?
[code]sign.signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getByName(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;));[/code]

Can somebody help?</description>

              <p>Just replace every “127.0.0.1” by your ip and don’t forget to compile. If it doesn’t work something else than the ip has to be the issue</p>
