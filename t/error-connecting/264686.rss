    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting/264686</link>
    <description>Can anybody be a volunteer and go to client.silabsoft.org
let it load and type this in the ip
deathslayerz.no-ip.org
I&#39;m the owner and i can&#39;t log into that.
I have to use 0.0.0.0
If you tried it can u reply saying if u did or not and it workd?

THIS IS NOT A ADVERTISMENT!
So if u go on it works. great, u don&#39;t have to play .
If it doesnt work can u tell me so i can work on it and make it try to work?
