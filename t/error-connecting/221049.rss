    <title>Error connecting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting/221049</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having error&#39;s connecting to my server, and don&#39;t know why. I&#39;ve port forwarded, I have a no-IP, I have the Environmental variables set, I have the newest JDK installed, and I have a working source. I just don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong. When I configure/run my server, it says its up, but I doesn&#39;t look that way when I try to log in. Anyone willing to have a little conversation with me to see whats wrong, I&#39;d appreciate it. Thanks.</description>

              <p>Yeah, i think I did, to the point where Ive added the new Service and enabled it, then I’ve typed in my IP, but it still doesn’t work. Maybe i’m taking a wrong step?</p>
