    <description>^^ Thanks for looking at my post. 
Okay, I just downloaded a source and client, and P-Fowarded and used port-checker tool to confirm that is was &#39;open.&#39; I changed my IP in client.java in the client, and I can connect to the server but...my friends can&#39;t. Please pm or reply to this. I also have skype and teamviewer.
