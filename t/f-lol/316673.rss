    <description>Don&#39;t know who is or isn&#39;t aware of this, but Microsoft apparently has a new toy - the F# programming language. (wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they released &quot;Gb v1.0&quot; within the next month or two).

&quot;Why&quot; is beyond me.</description>

<p>edit: To be on-topic, I’ve never heard of F#, but there are a lot of coding languages, and I’m sure it’s good in it’s own way.</p>

              <p>might it be important to know that .NET CLI intermediate bytecode is not interpreted by Microsoft’s implementation but instead all compiled to native code at one point or another; AOT or JIT. however, the Sun HotSpot JVM only JIT compiles ‘hotspots’ in code, or frequently-used blocks of code that could use a speed boost for performance, and does not support AOT. also… elf is pe? huhhhhhhhhhhhh i hope you just meant executable lol. andddd gcj compiles to native assemblies.</p>

              <p>from what i understand php has to stay interpreted thats about it as it just parses pages at runtime but then again the zend optimizer w\e does what you say with the little boosts etc… but then you can write a CGI website completely natively in C which will never match up to php unless you are a horrible coder.</p>
<p>Honestly dude… maybe they do some special magic under the hood these interpreters but then again you gotta look at the general prospective of things…</p>
<p>If a language requires hard drive access each time like websites… in php it will only be as fast as the hard drive access speed.<br>
Then if a language stores stuff in memory for later use and still is interpreted it will be as fast as the VM that runs it.</p>
<p>It’s all personal preference I dont know what to say you wrote a whole BOOK to things I already know.</p>
<p>They ain’t crap but they are in a controlled environment they are not gods themselves, plus if a language is a standard, then it should be a god in my opinion. Well those can be compiled to bytecode but they are not stepped to their full potential some lag added everywhere. Why not create a very clean execution of machine code not depending on a host to add their re-routes whatever goes on i don’t know.</p>
<p>All i know all sucky languages can be decompiled… not saying C/C++ can’t but no full example is possible to my knowledge only maybe very small functions if you are lucky… but things like variables etc… don’t exist after being compiled in C++ they are just mear memory locations without any names same for function names and all just addresses stored in a db. I could be wrong lol.</p>
<p>Then you would say in java you can optimize every long variable name to just very short ones with some obfuscater and that will fix that program but still thats not as good as it could be.</p>
<p>But who cares whatever everything is good… computers are going faster then ever who cares really I just like things done right</p>

<blockquote>
<p>any interpreted language is crap why even make more ugly languages when you got the simplety of java for that. They should build more native code assemblers for these languages</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You are so fucking stupid it’s not funny.  I’m trying to think about how to prove this right now and I’ve come to the conclusion that is isn’t necessary, your lack of intelligence is so painfully obvious.<br>
I’m going to do it anyway.</p>
<p>[ul][li]You don’t know what the fuck you are talking about.<br>
You say interpreted languages are crap and then you recommend Java.  Guess what, Java is compiled to bytecode, which is an intermediate language that gets interpreted in a VM.<br>
I’ll be fair though and assume you meant interpreted as in something like PHP, Perl, ECMAScript, etc.  Too bad you’re still a fucking idiot.  F# is not an interpreted language by your definition because F#, like all other .NET languages, gets compiled to CIL, which is essentially bytecode.<br>
Now, both Java bytecode and CIL utilize JIT to convert as much code as possible to native code, making it into a ‘native language’, but not really.[/li]<br>
[li]You have the bold idea that interpreted languages are crap (again, going to go with your definition of interpreted).<br>
I’m curious, what do you think of Ruby? Lisp? Smalltalk? PHP? ECMAScript?  These languages are used by many, many large companies in very, very large applications.  Do you know why? It’s because they aren’t crap.<br>
In many cases the advantages of a higher level language far outweigh the (minuscule) overhead of them being interpreted (disregarding the fact that pretty much every fucking worthwhile ‘interpreted’ language has some sort of very efficient intermediate form or utilizes JIT).[/li]<br>
[li]Syntax/style is a matter of personal opinion.  Many people find Lisps for example to be extremely ugly, while many other people find Lisps to be extremely sleek and elegant and sexy.  Likewise with F#/OCAML/Java/C/Ruby/Python/whatever.  Being ugly (which is an opinion mind you), does not make a language crap, it makes you ignorant and fucking stupid.[/li]<br>
[li]Native code assemblers? Again, you have no fucking idea what you are talking about.  I’m not even sure what you mean by ‘native code assemblers’, but since you’re a moron I’m going to assume you mean compiling ‘interpreted’ languages to some sort of PE format (EXE, ELF).  Guess what? .NET languages can be built into an executable.  So can OCAML, several Lisps, Haskell, FORTH, others.  However though, just about every other language I’ve mentioned gets compiled into some sort of executable format.  Java has class files and JARs, Python has compiled Python files/modules, PHP can be precompiled.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>I don’t think you understand one bit how programming languages work, how they are implemented, parsed, compiled, executed.  I don’t think you understand what dynamically typed languages, statically typed languages, strongly typed languages, weakly typed languages, etc, are.</p>
<p>What you wrote is basically the extremely ignorant and uninformed emotional thoughts of a preteen boy whose only experience with programming is with some awfully written private server maintained by thousands of other kids just like yourself.  Please, think a little bit the next time you post on this forum.</p>
