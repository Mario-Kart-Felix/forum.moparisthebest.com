    <title>Thumbnails of every Item In RS</title>

    <description>Note: This is pretty much the best forums to ask questions about models, Else, they will not be answered by the right type of person, If you know what I mean

Yes, I need a picture of Every Item In The Game, If possable from any of the newer caches.... (perferbly 525+)
The pictures need to be about 96pt by 96pt dimensions. Perferbly in gif.

I have been leeching the pictures from this Official RS URL: &quot;http://itemdb-rs.runescape.com/2618_obj_big.gif?id=&quot;
Only Items that exist are tradable Items that can be sold/bought on the GrandExchange. Quest Item Pictures Don&#39;t Exist.

I have a folder on my Server full of what I have so far (Item_IDHERE.gif) : http://sonis.tv/tv/HACK/

Almost 80% of the Item IDs ARE NOT avaible from my method of getting Pictures.
The purpose of the pictures is to make a php UI Editor for accounts on my private server. Also I want a search engine that actually has pictures of the Items. And I also have a second stat editor and search engine for stats of items for my server.

I was thinking on writting an aryan script to spawn an item then screen shot it, then drop it, and do the next item.... Then do the same for Objects and gfx&#39;s..... but That&#39;s only going to get me the items for a 317 server.... 

Where did that original search engine for Items and objects go? That Kulmar.tk or what ever it was back in 2004.........
If someone has that script, or know the original url I can try to use Archive.org to check the archive system for the pictures.....

I want all Items, Even bank Notes of each item if possable. Also the Null Items (Item # 999 is the null coin)

If someone can help, that would be tight, and i&#39;d appriate the help with getting the item pictures......

Thanks for reading,
Sonis RuZuix

EDIT:
So you know what code I&#39;m using:
[code]
for($i=0;$i&lt;20000;$i++){
$tempString = (&quot;http://itemdb-rs.runescape.com/2618_obj_big.gif?id=&quot; . $i);
$tempStringB = (&quot;./Item_&quot; . $i . &quot;.gif&quot;);
copy($tempString, $tempStringB);
}[/code]

That&#39;s Pretty much the raw version, Mine uses a password, but that&#39;s the source........
You might want to add a check file size thingy after it, so if it&#39;s 549bytes, it&#39;s auto deleted ;D
There are couple objects that are under that size, Like: item# 428 (http://sonis.tv/tv/HACK/Item_428.gif)

Second edit:
I fixed up my code, I have practically a better script, but I still need al the items I can&#39;t get......
this is my php script....
[code]&lt;!-- GETS IMAGES FROM RUNESCAPE SERVER :) -- &gt;
&lt;!-- AND THEN I CAN SAY THAT IT&#39;S A MANUALLY SCREEN SHOT FROM THE AUTHOR WHO UPLOADED X[) --&gt;
&lt;!-- [jagex is the uploader, and it&#39;s publicly available... I do plan on giving these images out...] --&gt;

&lt;?php
if($_GET[&#39;password&#39;]==&quot;TYPEITHERE&quot;){
	echo(&quot;succesfull LOGIN!\n&lt;br/&gt;&quot;);
	$limit = 20000;
	if($_GET[image] != &quot;true&quot; &amp;&amp; $_GET[image] != &quot;prune&quot;){
		for($i=$_GET[amount];$i&lt;($limit/50);$i++){
			echo(&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&quot; . ($i * 50) . &quot;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;iframe src=\&quot;GET_IMAGE.php?image=true&amp;password=&quot; . $_GET[password] . &quot;&amp;amount=&quot; . ($i * 50) . &quot;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&quot;);
		}
	} else if ($_GET[image] == &quot;prune&quot;){

	} else {

			} else {

				echo(&quot;&lt;br/&gt;FINISHED ITEM # &quot; . $i . &quot; \n&quot;);
				if(filesize($tmpStringB) == 549)
					echo(&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMFG JESUS NEEDS TO DIE BECAUSE HE LIED TO ME ...... that is wierd ;D \n&quot;);

			}

		}
	}
} else {
	echo(&quot;TYPE IN THE PASSWORD! :: GET_IMAGE.php?password=TYPEITHERE\n&lt;br/&gt;YOU NOOB!\n&lt;br/&gt;Do not MAKE MY SCRIPT LAGG MY SERVER~~~~&quot;);
	if($_GET[&#39;password&#39;]==&quot;TYPEITHERE&quot;){
		echo(&quot;\n&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;br/&gt;OMG! That is a very good try! I actually made a reply to only that specific password... Type It Here.... OMG NOOB! IPBAN U?&quot;);
	}else if($_GET[&#39;password&#39;]!=&quot;&quot;){
		echo(&quot;\n&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;br/&gt;OMG! That is a very good try! but &#39;&quot;.$_GET[password].&quot;&#39; is not the password&quot;);
	}
}
?&gt;[/code]

Like I said, I need help with someone who knows how to get crap from cache &gt;_&lt; or has the images already (like in a zip)</description>

<p>By obtaining these “Pictures”, what are you actually going to achieve?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I want to achieve 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>I want to build a php web page with help of mr. ECMA, to edit character’s invo’s banks etcs…</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>I want to have a search engine for the items with pictures. I have one already set up with no pictures, but it’s really dull and boring… I’m going to use mr. Ecma and XSS to beautify my table of raw data…</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need more details, Just ask, but I really want to accomplish this task.<br>
I will give out the source code after I do this, as I have when I build the sql tables for items last year.</p>
<p>This task would prob be a 15minute job for someone who knows how to do this.<br>
I am going to finish doing what I started yesterday, leeching from runescape…</p>
<p>The reason I want the cache or rs’s screen shots is because they already have a transparent background. If I manually screen shot the items from the rs game, then I will not have transparent backgrounds by default. I could use a client that has edited backgrounds, and change it to white/blue…</p>
<p>Once again, Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
I finished getting all the items I can from RuneScape’s Public DB, But that’s only a total of 1,997 of the public Items out of 15k… They are pretty much all the popular items, But I Still need the rest, else I’ll have to use a picture like a big (X) for non-available picture… or w/e… Oh and a problem with screenshots for models : stackable items will have a number above it. If you want a copy of my crap, don’t hesitate to leech from my server, or use my script. I’ll add all these images to a zip folder tomorrow after my PHY101 and MATH107 classes. Time for bed. good nite.</p>

No.</p>
<p>To get pictures you will need to manually take a capture of them and save them since the items are saved as models <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> images on the cache.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, I am aware of that as of my current skill level. But maybe Someone could make a model viewer that takes a screen shot from a certain direction.</p>
<p>I’ve gotten about 400 Items so far… I plan on having all the available items that’s public soon… I was also thinking on taking the pictures from fansites that already have screen shots of there items…</p>
<p>RuneScape made all there item id’s in there scripts the same as the game, so labeling the pictures I get from runescape’s website is easy as I already have all the item’s names / descriptions and stats/prices in my sql db…</p>
<p>I was going to ask one of my friends for help making a scene with the camra and imbedding the model in that scene, but I’m unable to contact them…</p>
<p>I’ll clean out the mumbo jumbo crap from my first post right now, so my post is more clear…</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
I was also thinking that maybe a command in a 508/525 server can be made. Using an auto increasment autotyper, write a big_endian picture to an interface table, then screen shot it with like HyperCam From This X, y to x2, y2 with like f7. and f3 will type the command that’s auto increased, or something simular to that idea…</p>
<p>If you have all the items, don’t matter if it starts at item4, i can make a php script to rename files, and use an offset to change the names…</p>
<p>I’m not sure of how to place an item in an interface like the quest logs or anywhere for that matter. I usually deal with scripting.<br>
I have an auto typer on my home computer written in java that supports autoincreasement. And a registered version of a hypercam is just as easy to get =D</p>
<p>I can’t get my 525 client to work though, Would my idea for the big_edian or what ever you use to add an item’s model to an interface work? Like rs uses the pictures in the interfaces like the smithing tables or the cooking books to how to cook a book or what ever…</p>
<p>If someone could point me to the code to place a model with stream code, that’ll be nice. Like what frame do I use? like frame126 is text only &gt;_&lt;…</p>
<p>If someone get’s the drift and know a friend, ask them, These pictures are very important, And I have all weekend open to get all the pictures =D</p>
<p>Thanks for reading</p>
