    <description>Hey MS members! I&#39;m interested in playing Runescape again. I had my own server called CookiesandMilk if anyone still knows of it.
I would like to start a fresh server , i need someone who has experience in coding the servers , i have experience too , but i forgot as i did 2-3 years ago. If anybody is interested PM me or leave a message here , i will gladly contact you ASAP ! Thanks! :)

P.S I&#39;m also new to the forums, give me heads up if this is off-topic? Would be appreaciated!</description>

<p>I’d try making the post more professional looking, more specific, and then put it in the right section. That’s just me though, but you should really post this in development teams. Don’t forget to add what your ideas for said server are, and so on and so fourth. Good luck.</p>
