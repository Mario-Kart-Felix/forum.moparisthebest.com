    <description>Hey MS members! I&#39;m interested in playing Runescape again. I had my own server called CookiesandMilk if anyone still knows of it.
I would like to start a fresh server , i need someone who has experience in coding the servers , i have experience too , but i forgot as i did 2-3 years ago. If anybody is interested PM me or leave a message here , i will gladly contact you ASAP ! Thanks! :)

P.S I&#39;m also new to the forums, give me heads up if this is off-topic? Would be appreaciated!</description>

              <p>Read the rules before posting please, this is the server ADVERTISEMENTS section.<br>
Also requests for programmers are not allowed, if you really want to team up with somebody you should make a thread in the development team section. But that section is also for development, so if you don’t post any development or images it will be removed.</p>
