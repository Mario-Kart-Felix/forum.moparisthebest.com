    <title>Deleting objects within a certain area</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/deleting-objects-within-a-certain-area/251802</link>
    <description>Ok so I&#39;ve finally found a decent place for a pk area, but it&#39;s covered in trees! Now I know how to delete objects, but to do it for every single tree It would take forever. So is there a way to delete objects within a certain area? I&#39;ve though of one way, a loop of some sort.

[code]
for(x = 2627; x &lt; 2675; x++) {
    for(y = 3473; y &lt; 3503; y++) {
        deletethatobject(x, y);
    }
}
[/code]

That would probably lag the hell out of the server though, seen as each x loop it does it does 30 y loops :S.

Anyone has a better way?</description>

              <p>Ahh thanks for the help, I tried my way. It worked pretty nearly apart from the fact when server started it disconnected me about 5 times. Runs stable then. But then theres the problem of the trees still showing on minimap and for a pking area it’s actually pretty annoying. So I’ll go find somewhere else <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Oh btw if anyone knows of any good enclosed places for a pk area then please say.</p>

              <p>You can try creating a class file that loads deleted objects through a XML file. Example…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;object&gt;
/* 
 * @Starts the XML file
 */

&lt;delete&gt;
ID
ID
ID
ID

/*
 * @Put all deleted objects here.
 */

&lt;/delete&gt;

&lt;replaceObj&gt;

/*
 * @All replaced Objects here...
 */

&lt;/replaceObj&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Make the XML file load like that, I don’t know how to create XML files, but that should be an example of how to do it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
