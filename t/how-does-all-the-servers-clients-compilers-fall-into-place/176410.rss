[center]Welcome to the Basics tutorial, Please Read before removing/locking/posting[/center]

[hr]

[center]Summary[/center]
In this tutorial you will get to know what all the stuff to these private servers really are. Y&#39;all have a basic understanding but I will teach how everything works together.

[hr]

[center]What you will learn.[/center]

[ul][li]What is Java basically (not a java tutorial)[/li]
[li]What clients are and what they do.[/li]
[li]What servers are and what they do.[/li]
[li]What compilers are and what they do.[/li]
[li]A bit about packets[/li][/ul]


[hr]

Lets get started why don&#39;t we? Ok, First off your server files are made by a programming languages called Java. Java is a 3rd generation programming language. Well, I bet your kinda wondering how programing works. Well by itself a computer or a machine is smart, not at all to be in fact. A computer is essentially just a big bunch of small electronic switches that are either on or off. By setting different combinations of these switches, you can make the computer do something, for example, display something on the screen or make a sound. that really all programming is to be basic. Now that you know what programming does you probably will understand everything else better. Computers use a simple language called binary code its simple because the  code only consist of 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s. 1 meaning on and 0 meaning off (goes back to the switches). Now talking to a computer in binary code would be like talking to your friend in japanese you can do it. But whats the point? A programming language acts as a translator between you and the computer, you can use a programming language to instruct the computer in a way that is easier to learn and understand. Ok, I know almost none of this had to do with Java but it will kinda give you a better understanding of what it exactly is.
Ok, now on to compilers. A compiler takes the instructions written in the Java programming language (please do note that I&#39;m writing the tutorial about Java so when I say Java programming language I don&#39;t mean thats the only language its used for) and converts them to binary code. This giving your server the functions that you programmed it to do.
Ok, Clients. A client is a application/program that accesses a service from a server or another computer system known as a server. So here is where your clients such as the silab client connects to the computer that is running the server such as liquidscape? or some other type of Server.
Ok, now Ill talk about servers. A server is a application or program that gets connected to by clients. The server accepts connections and sends back responses. The is where your packets come in all packets really are, are bits and pieces of information that a computer receives and reads.
How it works, ok so basically you&#39;ve learned that. When you program your files, and compile it, it turns into binary code for the computer to read. Then you run the server and clients get connected to the server, the server sends responses back to the client (using packets) the client reads the information and you have your game.</description>
