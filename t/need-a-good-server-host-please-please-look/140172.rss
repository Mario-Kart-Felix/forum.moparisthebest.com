    <description>Ive spent so long on my server, ive finally finished my 1st version and its ready to be put online!, but because moparscape only works for like 5% of people i can&#39;t host it. Ive spent 1 year to try and get it to work, but i just can&#39;t host anything. 

Add my msn - ben_tomo2@hotmail.co.uk for more information 

Thanks
