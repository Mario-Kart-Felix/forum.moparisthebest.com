    <title>[pi] Votefor command? [pi]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-votefor-command-pi/405570</link>
    <description>hi everyone, ive tried and tried to do this right but im not getting anything from it, can someone please make me a ::votefor (playernamehere) command? id really like to have one for my server so i can make people vote, if you can help it would really be awesome.

::votefor would basically open up the vote pages for another player. i know there are commands like it so that itll open for the entire server but since i have vote for cash, its easyest to have it only go to one player. so again if you could help it would be awesome</description>
