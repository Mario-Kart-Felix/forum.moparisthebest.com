    <description>Hello world,

I&#39;m pretty new to development. At first I was interested in creating a rsps, but found out quickly that I wasn&#39;t ready for multiplayer dev yet so I figured I would take advantage of the game development section here til I feel more comfortable and attempt to tackle a rsps again.

So, as I learn, I suppose I will be posting little projects here and there. I guess we will see what I can dish out over time.  :)

Guess I&#39;m pretty much done with my introduction. I look forward to being apart of this community, nice to meet you all in advance and happy programming :D</description>
