    <title>[New Question Inside] Help I&#39;m new with this bluurrs client thing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-question-inside-help-im-new-with-this-bluurrs-client-thing/350235</link>
    <description>I just got a Bluurrs client and the client works and all but when I log into my server, or at least should I say, try to log in it logs in for one second then it logs back out. But it doesn&#39;t even do a complete log in. I wonder if there&#39;s some sort of code i need to add to my server source to make it work... It&#39;s as you all might have guessed a DeltaScape Server. I just wanted to see a new gameframe because I got tired of the old DeltaScape client gameframe. Can anyone help?

Thanks!

P.S. Is there a way to make the Bluurrs client load faster... it starts going slow at around &quot;loading maps 83%.&quot; 

**Fixed this part but please read my newer post in this same thread.</description>

              <p>What!? I don’t know… Anyways I fixed it and I’m able to log in but there’s a few things I need to fix:</p>
<p>1.) When it logs me in it shows that interface with the two heads with both Arrgh or whatever. How do I remove that?</p>
<p>2.) When I try to walk using the minimap, I click the minimap and it freezes the client. Where should I find the code to fix this?</p>
<p>3.) The common character glitch where the character, I don’t know how to describe this but, sort or bobbles his head and depending on what I’m wearing does the bending over glitch thing.</p>
<p>If I find anymore I’ll try to fix but these are the main ones that need fixing.</p>
