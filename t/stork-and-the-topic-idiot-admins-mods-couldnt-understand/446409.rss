    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stork-and-the-topic-idiot-admins-mods-couldnt-understand/446409</link>
    <description>This is to give everyone a timeframe on how long it will take to reach particular points level to get certain stats, and compare towards RSC&#39;s original rate.

1 pt = 160xp
99 stat = 81,826pts
120 stat = 651,708pts

Assumptions: 12k pts/hr (WITH SUB), 7.5k pts/hr (WITHOUT SUB). I generally get 10-14k/hr at fire giants with sub when there is 1 other person. There can be anywhere from 2-5 people at a time there usually. 12k is an ambitious hourly rate to use.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STAT TIMEFRAME

WITH SUB (12k pts/hr)
1 x 120 stat: 54.3 hrs (10days, 4hrs, 20 mins @ 5hrs/day training)
3 x 120 stat: (atk, def, str): 162.9 hrs (32 days, 2hrs, 55 mins @ 5hrs/day training)
6 x 120 stat: (flat 120s): 325.8hrs (65 days, 40 mins @ 5hrs/day training) OR [2months, 3days]

WITHOUT SUB (7.5k pts/hr)
1 x 120 stat: 86.9 hrs (17days, 1hr, 54mins @ 5hrs/day training)
3 x 120 stat: (atk, def, str): 260.7hrs (52 days, 42mins @ 5hrs/day training)
6 x 120 stat: (flat 120s): 521.4hrs (104days, 1hr, 24mins @ 5hrs/day training) OR [3months, 11 days]



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPARISON TO RSC

1 x Man yields 29xp on RSC. http://runescapeclassic.wikia.com/wiki/Man 

On here:
1 x Man = 5pts = 800xp.

800/29 = 27.6x Experience Rate of RSC.

BUT, this is not true. As we are training to a level that is eight times (8x) greater than RSC&#39;s 99 stat. (120XP/99XP [or use points above]) we need to divide this figure by 8.

27.6 / 8 = 3.45

In conclusion, this server could be considered a server that is 3.45x the experience rate of RSC. 

In my personal opinion, a 3.45x RSC experience rate is WAY TOO LOW for a server to be considered a &#39;PK Server&#39;.</description>

<p>Ask stork himself what the point for exp ratio was on his server. I’ve done a lot of research, and I know a fact, stork started with 2 points per men, and 250 experience per point, 6 points = 1k gp, he raised the amount of points you got from mobs, but decreased all the ratio’s at the same time, making 12 points = 1k gp, 125 experience for point, and 5 points per a man.</p>
<p>It’s stupid to think that you must get that 120 flats and full gear to pk, yet, everybody does…Did you do that in RSC aswell? Don’t think so.</p>
<p>I’m trying to make a PK server that would last longer than a month, and if I rise the rates, it won’t, it will die as just as fast you get your stats up. Before people even know about the server, it will be dead. So the smartest route is to make it decently fast rate for 99, and slow for 120, which is how it is now. Meanwhile you all are training, new people will come in see the playercount and stay, and this way the playerbase grows and you will have a lot more fun with more people than just pking the 4-5 people all over again. This of course, requires a lot of advertisement to happen.</p>
<p>Also, I’m pretty sure if I rised the stats +5 every week instead of gone straight up to 120, u wouldn’t be here giving 3rd grade math lessons.</p>
<p>In short; You wanted a storkpk server, you got one.[/quote]</p>
<p>RSC Community has a right to know that people are quitting a server that is ran by an under-capable admin that does not listen to his playerbase.</p>
<p>By you attempting to make it last longterm and having the XP low its killing the server before its getting a chance. At the current rate it does last longer than a month, in fact it takes you 3 months and 11 days @ 5hrs/day to get 120 flats in all stats…</p>
<p>Even with the double XP event there is only 28 players online at the moment. Thats a lot less than the 60-80 we had in the first week.</p>
<p>Why is it stupid to think i want max gear and max levels so that im on a level playing field with everybody else? Flats is where real skill comes in as there is less variance with your ‘lucky hits’ and relies more on skill of catching, casting and helping team/mates.</p>
<p>Its not my problem if you need third grade math lessons. Simple division, its all i did.</p>

              <p>This is to give everyone a timeframe on how long it will take to reach particular points level to get certain stats, and compare towards RSC’s original rate.</p>
<p>1 pt = 160xp<br>
99 stat = 81,826pts<br>
120 stat = 651,708pts</p>
<p>Assumptions: 12k pts/hr (WITH SUB), 7.5k pts/hr (WITHOUT SUB). I generally get 10-14k/hr at fire giants with sub when there is 1 other person. There can be anywhere from 2-5 people at a time there usually. 12k is an ambitious hourly rate to use.</p>
<hr>
<p>STAT TIMEFRAME</p>
<p>WITH SUB (12k pts/hr)<br>
1 x 120 stat: 54.3 hrs (10days, 4hrs, 20 mins @ 5hrs/day training)<br>
3 x 120 stat: (atk, def, str): 162.9 hrs (32 days, 2hrs, 55 mins @ 5hrs/day training)<br>
6 x 120 stat: (flat 120s): 325.8hrs (65 days, 40 mins @ 5hrs/day training) OR [2months, 3days]</p>
<p>WITHOUT SUB (7.5k pts/hr)<br>
1 x 120 stat: 86.9 hrs (17days, 1hr, 54mins @ 5hrs/day training)<br>
3 x 120 stat: (atk, def, str): 260.7hrs (52 days, 42mins @ 5hrs/day training)<br>
6 x 120 stat: (flat 120s): 521.4hrs (104days, 1hr, 24mins @ 5hrs/day training) OR [3months, 11 days]</p>
<hr>
<p>COMPARISON TO RSC</p>
<p>1 x Man yields 29xp on RSC. <a href="http://runescapeclassic.wikia.com/wiki/Man" rel="nofollow noopener">http://runescapeclassic.wikia.com/wiki/Man</a></p>
<p>On here:<br>
1 x Man = 5pts = 800xp.</p>
<p>800/29 = 27.6x Experience Rate of RSC.</p>
<p>BUT, this is not true. As we are training to a level that is eight times (8x) greater than RSC’s 99 stat. (120XP/99XP [or use points above]) we need to divide this figure by 8.</p>
<p>27.6 / 8 = 3.45</p>
<p>In conclusion, this server could be considered a server that is 3.45x the experience rate of RSC.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, a 3.45x RSC experience rate is WAY TOO LOW for a server to be considered a ‘PK Server’.</p>
