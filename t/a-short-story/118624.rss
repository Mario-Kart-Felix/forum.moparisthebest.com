On one fine day About a year ago Marc took his small Friend To visit Falodor park:

Marc went for a small walk to find Ollie:

Ollie was being a bad boy so Marc took Ollie away for a year.
Marc took Ollie back but Ollie started to walk away:

And then tried to hide in some plants:

Then Played in the mud:

After Marcs little boo-boo he found Ollie on some of Farmers Bob&#39;s flowers:
