<li>Check the details you have are correct, and the no-ip DUC is online and showing the ip you registered as working.</li>
<li>Check you have port-forwarded correctly in your routerâ€™s configuration website (i.e 192.168.2.1)</li>
<li>Make sure your server is accepting connections and the batch file says it is online.</li>
