    <title>Bad bug with dodian sources - read if you have devolution</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bad-bug-with-dodian-sources-read-if-you-have-devolution/253217</link>
    <description>Okay this really pisses me off. I&#39;ve been working on my server for quite some time now and this one really bad bug just comes up out of nowhere. A really bad DUPLICATION bug, it really sucks. It completely ruined everything I just did. And I cant seem to find a way to fix it. NO ITS NOT THE SMITHING BUG and you can do it with ANY CLIENT. It has to deal with trade window and its the easiest thing to do, you dont even have to click fast. I&#39;m not going to say how it is done because I&#39;ve tried it on 6 different devolution servers and it works.

YOUR SERVER COULD HAVE THE SAME BUG.

I was ready to release my server on new years, and this just screwed me over. I&#39;m standing in the game waiting for my friend to log in and a guy come up to me and said he found a bug. I figured this was just a normal bug, it turns out any item I give him he can make 2 of. I cant think what to do but make a whole new source, it really sucks.

For any of you who have devolution source, please give me your server ip and your admin/screen name. I will test it on your server for free. I am doing this for the good of dodian servers.
