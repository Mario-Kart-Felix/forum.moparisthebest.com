<p>She’s not actually leaving it to the cat though. All she wanted was someone who will take care of her cat like she always did, and that requires money. So the cat doesn’t own the money, a foundation does. The main goal of that foundation is to ensure the cat has a nice life.</p>
<p>Perhaps such a foundation turns into a charity.</p>

<p>well that’s just plain fucking wrong</p>
<p>hell as far as I’m aware, in the uk and most sane parts of the world, if a registered charity says they’ll use 5% of all money for admin costs, 15% for advertising and 80% to actually helping people then they are required by law to do just that</p>

<p>PS: I’m not serious, I would remove the whole “getting money because you parent were rich” system, and not just set a limit on it.</p>
