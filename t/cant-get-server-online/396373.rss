    <title>Can&#39;t get server online!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-get-server-online/396373</link>
    <description>Hey,

When I ran my server, i checked to see if it was online using a status checker. It said it was online, but when I sent my friend the client, they said that they had the &quot;error connecting to the server&quot; message. Can anybody help me please? 

I&#39;m positive that I put the right IP in the Client.Java and GUI, so I don&#39;t think its that. Could it be my no-ip?

P.s. I forgot to mention that I can connect, but they can&#39;t.</description>
