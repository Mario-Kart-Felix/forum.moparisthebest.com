    <title>Why are there so many idiots?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-are-there-so-many-idiots/370785</link>
    <description>Just a little discussion, sometimes I want to punch a wall reading some of the idiots that post on this forum. Do you guys think it&#39;s the RuneScape community that&#39;s attracting all of these 10 year olds?</description>

I think you have the wrong attitude about it and are, in all due respect, acting exactly just like how you described.</p>
<p>Maybe you should look at everyone individually. Maybe you should not cohere to this stero-typing and take a step back.</p>
<p>Of course it’s RuneScape that’s at the bottom of attracting people to this forums, the forum wouldn’t be here otherwise.</p>
<p>Now on the other hand, I can see where you’re coming from; someone starts to antagonise you, you want to say one better as to not look weak infront of everyone. This only makes things worse as you get tic for tac, flaming back and fourth and it only gives you a bad name as you just became the very thing you didn’t want, and all for trying to retain your dignity. Retaliating does the opposite of what you expect or want it to achieve.</p>
<p>So what do you do? It’s kind of a catch-22. If someones being a prick, instead of trying to get back at them and risk losing your own reputation, report and move on - therefore you are retaining (not gaining but at the same time not losing) your so called “image” or “reputation” (not Rep++) online.</p>
<p>You can’t judge every ten year-old from one singular ten-year old.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">I can’t put my finger on what I’m trying to get at here, I could explain it a hundred different ways, I just hope you catch my drift.</span><br>
[/quote]<br>
I was two lazy to read all of that, someone sum it up for me pweez? lmao[/quote]</p>
<p>Basically, the OP is just as bad as what he trying to describe.</p>
