    <title>Server Maker Release: Auto-Install, Includes Highscore Maker</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-maker-release-auto-install-includes-highscore-maker/395563</link>
    <description>Okay guys,
So the other day i released a highscores maker with auto-install, and i was acknowledged by Deathchaos9 who made the highscore scripts manually, he told me that he was going to update his topic on Mopar to match the highscores maker. So i am not going into detail with that. Now before i start giving out instructions, you guys need to know how to set up Xampp.
So here it is (Credits to Deathchaos9):
[size=12pt][b][font=verdana]Chapter 1 - XAMPP Setup[/font][/b][/size]
[b]Step one:[/b] 
Download XAMPP from the following link 
http://www.oldapps.com/xampp.php?app=f7177163c833dff4b38fc8d2872f1ec6

[b]
Step two:[/b]
Once you have downloaded XAMPP, run the application file and proceed to install XAMPP.
[b]1.[/b] Select your language.

[b]2.[/b] Select your directory. (C:\xampp\ by default)

[IMG]http://i373.photobucket.com/albums/oo176/Ranger_Owns/Capture2-1.png[/img]


[b]3.[/b] Select to install both Apache and MySQL services.

[IMG]http://i373.photobucket.com/albums/oo176/Ranger_Owns/Capture3.png[/img]


[b]4.[/b] Wait for everything to install, when prompted to start control panel, click yes.

The control panel shows you whats going on with XAMPP, it will show you if Apache and MySQL are running(If they are not, please click the start button next to both of them)
If a message comes up saying one of the services is not installed, click the checkbox next to that service to install it.
[IMG]http://i373.photobucket.com/albums/oo176/Ranger_Owns/Capture4.png[/img]

[b]Step three:[/b]
Once all of that is up and running go to
http://localhost/security/xamppsecurity.php

Here we will set up the password for MySQL.
For some odd reason, this page likes to be German, regardless of what language you installed in. If not, lucky you, below is a translation.

Akuelles Passwort: (current password)
Neues Passwort: (new password)
Wiederhole neues Passwort: (confirm new password)
The current password is &quot;&quot;
After filling that out click &quot;Passwort andern&quot; (change password)

[IMG]http://i373.photobucket.com/albums/oo176/Ranger_Owns/Capture6.png[/img]

Alright, XAMPP is now set up on your computer, lets move on.

[hr]

So now that we have xampp installed we can easily start the server/highscores maker. So to download the files go to this link: [url=http://uppit.com/v2b9mi8c7tay/Server_Maker_Release.zip]http://uppit.com/v2b9mi8c7tay/Server_Maker_Release.zip[/url]
Now that you have the files, extract it to the directory which is /Xampp/Htdocs/ located in C:/ or Computer. Now that its extracted simply go to: [url=http://localhost/Server%20Maker%20Release/install.php]http://localhost/Server%20Maker%20Release/install.php[/url]
Now, follow the directions given. After it is installed a message will appear stating that everything went correct and the server and highscores are ready. Now that its installed, you can now delete the /install/ directory and install.php file to avoid hackers.
Now that you have deleted the directories, simply Compile and Run. If you want to play the server, go into your /Client/ directory and simply click Run there to :D.
__________
Have Fun,
Nathan

P.S. The Server Maker uses the Winterlove 435 Revision Source and Client. The server maker creates and runs servers on port 9000.</description>

<p>Because everyone is 12-13 years old.  You can tell who is mature because they use proper grammar.  That’s what I love about the internet.  And you should know that, now quit trolling.</p>

Your saying you know proper grammar? Since when do you start a sentence with “and”? Never so quit criticizing everyone when your not perfect.</p>

              <p>Okay guys,<br>
So the other day i released a highscores maker with auto-install, and i was acknowledged by Deathchaos9 who made the highscore scripts manually, he told me that he was going to update his topic on Mopar to match the highscores maker. So i am not going into detail with that. Now before i start giving out instructions, you guys need to know how to set up Xampp.<br>
So here it is (Credits to Deathchaos9):<br>
[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">[font=verdana]Chapter 1 - XAMPP Setup[/font]</span>[/size]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Step one:</span><br>
Download XAMPP from the following link<br>
<a href="http://www.oldapps.com/xampp.php?app=f7177163c833dff4b38fc8d2872f1ec6" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.oldapps.com/xampp.php?app=f7177163c833dff4b38fc8d2872f1ec6</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Step two:</span><br>
Once you have downloaded XAMPP, run the application file and proceed to install XAMPP.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">1.</span> Select your language.</p>
<p><img src="http://i373.photobucket.com/albums/oo176/Ranger_Owns/Capture.png" alt width="287" height="128"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2.</span> Select your directory. (C:\xampp\ by default)</p>
<p><img src="http://i373.photobucket.com/albums/oo176/Ranger_Owns/Capture2-1.png" alt width="492" height="299"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">3.</span> Select to install both Apache and MySQL services.</p>
<p><img src="http://i373.photobucket.com/albums/oo176/Ranger_Owns/Capture3.png" alt width="493" height="359"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">4.</span> Wait for everything to install, when prompted to start control panel, click yes.</p>
<p>The control panel shows you whats going on with XAMPP, it will show you if Apache and MySQL are running(If they are not, please click the start button next to both of them)<br>
If a message comes up saying one of the services is not installed, click the checkbox next to that service to install it.<br>
<img src="http://i373.photobucket.com/albums/oo176/Ranger_Owns/Capture4.png" alt width="436" height="309"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step three:</span><br>
Once all of that is up and running go to<br>
<a href="http://localhost/security/xamppsecurity.php" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://localhost/security/xamppsecurity.php</a></p>
<p>Here we will set up the password for MySQL.<br>
For some odd reason, this page likes to be German, regardless of what language you installed in. If not, lucky you, below is a translation.</p>
<p>Akuelles Passwort: (current password)<br>
Neues Passwort: (new password)<br>
Wiederhole neues Passwort: (confirm new password)<br>
The current password is “”<br>
After filling that out click “Passwort andern” (change password)</p>
<p><img src="http://i373.photobucket.com/albums/oo176/Ranger_Owns/Capture6.png" alt width="584" height="293"></p>
<p>Alright, XAMPP is now set up on your computer, lets move on.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>So now that we have xampp installed we can easily start the server/highscores maker. So to download the files go to this link: <a href="http://uppit.com/v2b9mi8c7tay/Server_Maker_Release.zip" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uppit.com/v2b9mi8c7tay/Server_Maker_Release.zip</a><br>
Now that you have the files, extract it to the directory which is /Xampp/Htdocs/ located in C:/ or Computer. Now that its extracted simply go to: <a href="http://localhost/Server%20Maker%20Release/install.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://localhost/Server%20Maker%20Release/install.php</a><br>
Now, follow the directions given. After it is installed a message will appear stating that everything went correct and the server and highscores are ready. Now that its installed, you can now delete the /install/ directory and install.php file to avoid hackers.<br>
Now that you have deleted the directories, simply Compile and Run. If you want to play the server, go into your /Client/ directory and simply click Run there to :D.</p>
<hr>
<p>Have Fun,<br>
Nathan</p>
<hr>
<p>P.S. The Server Maker uses the Winterlove 435 Revision Source and Client. The server maker creates and runs servers on port 9000.</p>
