    <title>How to keep JaGeX off your Ass for a little Longer</title>

    <description>I&#39;ve always noticed how they always talk about distributing their intellectual property, blah, blah, blah.

Make a loader. Something that grabs the client from an external place and reads the cache from the website or something. Therefore you aren&#39;t infringing on distributing their software.

This is more of a discussion thread as I want to know opinions on if this would work.</description>

There would be no point in hosting a server if this is the case, not unless you really enjoy spending a pocket full of money on something that is just mere nostalgia.</p>
