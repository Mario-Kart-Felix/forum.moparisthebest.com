    <title>I Vain I - We will miss you!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-vain-i-we-will-miss-you/391056</link>
    <description>Well, today he was acting funny via MSN, and even asked me to help him get banned on Mopar (he asked a mod how to get banned, and was willfully banned). After about an hour or so, I got a PM. Came to this PM 2 hours late as I was doing yard work. Figured the word should be spread, and let everybody intemperate this on their own.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, I&#39;m banned on Mopar, and I&#39;m quitting as well. It was nice meeting you, and even becoming friends. Sorry for being such a downer in the past, but my life is falling apart. I can&#39;t take it anymore, so goodbye.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Seems serious to me though, as there has been no weird talking until today, when I got home from work him asking how to get banned, etc. Anyways, Thomas H., We will miss you man, you were a good friend to alot of people.</description>

              <p>He told me he couldn’t handle the shit people give him about posting too much. I know how it feels for other reasons, and it’s more than enough for someone to want to get away (especially after losing his badge and rep, that we all know he cared a lot about)</p>
<p>He may be back, who knows. He might be looking for a reason to create a new account that isn’t rep locked, idk. And it’s entirely possible something DID happen to his life, nobody knows for sure except him</p>
