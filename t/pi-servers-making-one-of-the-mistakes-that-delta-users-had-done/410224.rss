    <title>PI servers, making one of the mistakes that Delta users had done?</title>

    <description>(not sure if this is in the right section)

As you know, a usual Delta source would have an extremely long process in it&#39;s client class.

I recently downloaded a PI source to skim over and test some things that I was selling on it, and I noticed..

PI servers that are feature-rich (usually the 602-look alike sources) have unnecessary things in the void process (client class). I see things like an overload timer, the quest tab information, showing interfaces while in a specific area, and other things too. 

These can easily be called somewhere else, other than every 500-600ms.. 

It&#39;s just something I noticed and really peeved me about.. People always complain about delta sources having a long process, maybe PI and Delta aren&#39;t so different after all. (with the exception of both of the sources being winterlove based)</description>
