    <title>Damage &quot;Splat&quot; Not Appearing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/damage-splat-not-appearing/239522</link>
    <description>Well, recently I&#39;ve noticed that when Ian NPC attacks me the damage &quot;splat&quot; that tells the amount of damage is not appearing, its very frustrating but I can&#39;t find what&#39;s wrong. If anyone has had a problem such as this before or anyone knows the coding that makes said splat happen, I would be very thankful if you would post so :), Thanks.</description>
