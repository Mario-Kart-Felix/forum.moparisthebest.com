    <title>Need someone to help with making my portal work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-someone-to-help-with-making-my-portal-work/286609</link>
    <description>Please can someone walk me through how to make my portal work please?

I know the code should be:
&quot;case 2468: // Portal At Front.
            teleportToX = 2358;
            teleportToY = 4959;
            sendMessage(&quot;You teleport to the Non-Combat Training grounds.&quot;);
            break;&quot;

But when i put that in i got 100 errors.

Please can someone tell me exactly what to do?

Thanks,
Jake :D

p.s i have looked everywhere for tuts and none of them seems to help as i always get errors.</description>
