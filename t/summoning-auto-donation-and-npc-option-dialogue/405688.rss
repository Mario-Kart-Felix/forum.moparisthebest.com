    <title>Summoning, Auto Donation and NPC Option Dialogue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/summoning-auto-donation-and-npc-option-dialogue/405688</link>
    <description>Okay, My base is ErasedPkz and when I downloaded it it had summoning already in it but when I go into the summoning file to see how it works it tells me to use the item needed with the pouch but that doesn&#39;t do anything.

Second problem; Auto donation. I got a tut for an auto donation system off R-S and I added everything in, compiled and got no errors, but whenever someone logs out it gives me an exception error in the run console. I think i added the logout methods to the wrong place. if you want me to post my runtime errors or a link to the tut i will.

last of all; i&#39;m trying to add an NPC that tells you all about everything you need to know. I know this is sort of asking for someone to spoon feel but i&#39;ve added things in so much and compiled and they haven&#39;t worked for me so im asking someone if they could write out the code for me and tell me where to add it
the dialogueAction == 14 and the two dialogue cases are 52 and 54, I&#39;m 100% sure it goes in clicking buttons but i dont know what cases to add it under.</description>
