    <title>Playing OSRS with no clue what&#39;s what</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/playing-osrs-with-no-clue-whats-what/555186</link>
    <description>hi, i haven&#39;t logged on to runescape since it was 2007 and the wilderness got deleted. i watched old school videos like a friend and framed for years, and im now in a situation where i want to play it and i can play it. 

it looks really interesting but i have no idea about anything. i dont know what half the items or monsters are. is there like a guide for people like me or a video that will give me some sort of incline? i feel for my old brain i will be either too far behind to compete in the game and cannot learn half a game. as i dont really have 24/7 to sit and play and learn it all like i did 9 years ago.

i just need something overall to get the jist of things. does anyone know of anything?</description>

              <p>Add me <a class="mention" href="/u/a">@A</a> Wild Nolan if you need help in-game with anything! Just say you’re from Mopar and we’re straight. Also, it’d behoove of you to join some popular clan chat (i.e. soup, sparc mac, framed, etc.) so you have a community to ask questions if need be.</p>

              <p>Just keep up with updates on the site. I’m sure you have a general idea on how to play runescape? If not try tutorial island again and talk to a bunch of NPC’s in game. It’s more fun when you don’t know what the hell you’re doing. If you see something in game and don’t know what it is, ask a fellow player or google it.</p>
<p>What do you normally do when playing a new game? Do you research all the features, items, npcs, etc., first or do you just login and play?</p>

              <p>I had the same problem at first. But there isn’t one massive guide that explains it all that I have seen. What helped me was watching twitch streamers and just watching guides for every single bit of new content til I started understanding everything. But that will take time which it looks like you don’t want to spend much time on. But it will all become understandable eventually. Good luck on the leveling! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
