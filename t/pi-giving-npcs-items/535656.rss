    <description>hey guys so ive been working on this miniquest for some time now, i got most of it figured it out on my own, it requires the player to grab ned a bottle of rum from a crate in his cellar. i have it set so when a player talks to ned he asks why there in his house, and then gets to the point that he wants u to grab him his rum, once the player goes down and grabs the rum then they go talk to him again he opens up a new dialouge and the bottle is taken from the players inventory  (kinda like oh thanks for the bottle) but for some weird reason once one player gives him his bottle it seems for every other player (or acc i just made) ned talks to them as if they got him the bottle to, so it just dosnt quite make sence. heres my actionhandler to trigger the dialouge with the bottle: &lt;blockquote&gt;case 918:
		c.getDH().sendDialogues(420, npcType);
		if(c.getItems().playerHasItem(8940, 1)) {
		c.getItems().deleteItem(8940, 1);
		} else {
		c.getDH().sendDialogues(428, npcType);
		}
		break;&lt;/blockquote&gt; and if necessary heres the dialogue &lt;blockquote&gt;case 420:
		   sendNpcChat2(&quot;Hey there Friend!&quot;,&quot;Might i ask why your in my house?&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Al&quot;);
		   c.nextChat = 421;
		break;
		case 421:
			sendPlayerChat1(&quot;Oh You know, Just clicking on random door&#39;s intruding on things.&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 422;
		break;
		case 422:
		   sendNpcChat2(&quot;HAHAHA i like you!&quot;,&quot;You Have quite a since of humour!&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Al&quot;);
		   c.nextChat = 423;
		break;
		case 423:
			sendPlayerChat1(&quot;HaHa yeah, I guess i do. Is there anything you need help with?&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 424;
		break;
		case 424:
		   sendNpcChat2(&quot;Well now that you mention it..&quot;,&quot;Could you grab me a bottle from the cellar?&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Al&quot;);
		   c.nextChat = 425;
		break;
		case 425:
			sendPlayerChat1(&quot;Im looking for an Adventure, Im not your bartender!&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 426;
		break;
		case 426:
		   sendNpcChat2(&quot;Ohh but wait! Its not just an ordinary cellar..&quot;,&quot;No, no its a scary place, ive been hearing lots of noises&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Al&quot;);
		   c.nextChat = 427;
		break;
		case 427:
		   sendNpcChat2(&quot;Grab me some Red rum from the cellar and i will&quot;,&quot; tell you all about it.&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Al&quot;);
		   c.nextChat = 0;
		break;
		case 428:
		   sendNpcChat2(&quot;Thank you very much Friend!&quot;,&quot;now as i was saying, there seems to be alot of...&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Al&quot;);
		   c.nextChat = 429;
		break;
		case 429:
		   sendNpcChat2(&quot;Weird stuff happening down there, I was down there yesterday&quot;,&quot; and something caught my eye..&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Al&quot;);
		   c.nextChat = 430;
		break;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Could someone please tell me an easy fix or what i did/ didnt do right, Thanks :)</description>

              <p>Fancy quest stuff? I said that you should store an int for the ‘mini’ quest or what ever you want to call it so it knows what part each individual player is on.<br>
Exactly what I said here, in my comments:</p>
<pre><code>    //I also recommend storing an int (like int questName =0; and have it go up by one for each dialogue, or 'checkpoint'
    //of the quest, so that a player can't just snag the rum and start halfway through.

<p>its all good, Hey i was wondering another person was telling me i should maybe add an int to player.java and playersave.java, like  “bottlegiven = 0” or “bottlegiven = 1” would that be an alternative, or would it basicaly fall under the same lines (making it a quest and what not)<br>
[/quote]<br>
That is exactly what I told you to do…[/quote] No you told me to basicaly make the int and the quest stuff etc im asking if thats an alternative, like if i could possibly use that and store it for the player then without having to add all the fancy quest stuff it would just remember the player giving him the bottle.</p>

‘quest’ ‘miniquest’ etc. Doesn’t matter. You’re not going to get around this issue without adding another variable in. If you don’t want players to do it again, you want it to save to their account. That is that. There is no jumping around it.</p>

<p>In the form of an int:</p>
<p><code>
case 918:
        if(c.guestName == 2){
			if(c.getItems().playerHasItem(8940, 1)) {
					c.getItems().deleteItem(8940, 1);
					c.getDH().sendDialogues(428, npcType);

			c.sendMessage("I need to get that bottle of rum Ned asked me for...");

                c.getDH().sendDialogues(420, npcType);
				c.questName = 2;
			}
      break;</code></p>
<p>In the form of a boolean:</p>
<p><code>case 918:

Well if you put it that way it makes more sence, i have little knowledge of quests (as you can tell) i guess ill have to go through the progress of adding the quest to the quest bar and what not, i didnt think it would resort to that big of a project, thanks you have opened my eyes <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

To break it down for you:
What you did wrong was you had 'c.getDH().sendDialogues(420, npcType);' sending first thing, regardless of the code that follows
So, instead I've moved your code around so if the player has the rum, it first deletes it then sends the appropriate dialogues.
If the player doesn't have the item in question, it sends the dialogue 420.

              <p>[quote=“DAn0194, post:2, topic:535656”]It’s because your calling the npc text that says that they gave the rum to him change 428 dialogue id to 427.[/quote] thanks but all that does it just make it so after he tells you about the cellar he just stops then once you grab him the rum he starts off by saying “can you grab me some rum from the cellar” i just want to make it so it works for everyplayer, so not just one player can do the quest, it seems once ned recieves the rum in general he tells every body hes “thank you” even if they havent fetched it to him yet</p>

              <p>hey guys so ive been working on this miniquest for some time now, i got most of it figured it out on my own, it requires the player to grab ned a bottle of rum from a crate in his cellar. i have it set so when a player talks to ned he asks why there in his house, and then gets to the point that he wants u to grab him his rum, once the player goes down and grabs the rum then they go talk to him again he opens up a new dialouge and the bottle is taken from the players inventory  (kinda like oh thanks for the bottle) but for some weird reason once one player gives him his bottle it seems for every other player (or acc i just made) ned talks to them as if they got him the bottle to, so it just dosnt quite make sence. heres my actionhandler to trigger the dialouge with the bottle: </p><blockquote>case 918:<br>
c.getDH().sendDialogues(420, npcType);<br>
if(c.getItems().playerHasItem(8940, 1)) {<br>
c.getItems().deleteItem(8940, 1);<br>
} else {<br>
c.getDH().sendDialogues(428, npcType);<br>
}<br>
break;</blockquote> and if necessary heres the dialogue <blockquote>case 420:<br>
sendNpcChat2(“Hey there Friend!”,“Might i ask why your in my house?”, c.talkingNpc, “Al”);<br>
c.nextChat = 421;<br>
break;<br>
case 421:<br>
sendPlayerChat1(“Oh You know, Just clicking on random door’s intruding on things.”);<br>
c.nextChat = 422;<br>
break;<br>
case 422:<br>
sendNpcChat2(“HAHAHA i like you!”,“You Have quite a since of humour!”, c.talkingNpc, “Al”);<br>
c.nextChat = 423;<br>
break;<br>
case 423:<br>
sendPlayerChat1(“HaHa yeah, I guess i do. Is there anything you need help with?”);<br>
c.nextChat = 424;<br>
break;<br>
case 424:<br>
sendNpcChat2(“Well now that you mention it…”,“Could you grab me a bottle from the cellar?”, c.talkingNpc, “Al”);<br>
c.nextChat = 425;<br>
break;<br>
case 425:<br>
sendPlayerChat1(“Im looking for an Adventure, Im not your bartender!”);<br>
c.nextChat = 426;<br>
break;<br>
case 426:<br>
sendNpcChat2(“Ohh but wait! Its not just an ordinary cellar…”,“No, no its a scary place, ive been hearing lots of noises”, c.talkingNpc, “Al”);<br>
c.nextChat = 427;<br>
break;<br>
case 427:<br>
sendNpcChat2(“Grab me some Red rum from the cellar and i will”," tell you all about it.", c.talkingNpc, “Al”);<br>
c.nextChat = 0;<br>
break;<br>
case 428:<br>
sendNpcChat2(“Thank you very much Friend!”,“now as i was saying, there seems to be alot of…”, c.talkingNpc, “Al”);<br>
c.nextChat = 429;<br>
break;<br>
case 429:<br>
sendNpcChat2(“Weird stuff happening down there, I was down there yesterday”," and something caught my eye…", c.talkingNpc, “Al”);<br>
c.nextChat = 430;<br>
break;</blockquote> Could someone please tell me an easy fix or what i did/ didnt do right, Thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
