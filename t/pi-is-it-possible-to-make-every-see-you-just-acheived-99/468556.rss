<p>You would probably recognize a World Announcement as the “Yell” feature.</p>

              <p>Yes, It’s entirely possible. How do you want to do this though? The easiest way would probably be to use something such as a Yell Method when the Player receives the special 99 message. The possibilities on how to tell everyone are endless.</p>
