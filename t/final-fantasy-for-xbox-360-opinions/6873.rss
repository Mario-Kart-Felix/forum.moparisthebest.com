              <p>if you are talking about FFXI(Final Fantasy 11) then HELL YES! it is awesome, I still play it every now and then <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I never played it on 360, but it costs like…$15 to play…a month, $10 more than RS, but its HELLA worth it! awesome graphix and people arent assholes like they are on runescape.  IMO its ALL worth the money.  If you play, and get on Seraph server, holla at me <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
