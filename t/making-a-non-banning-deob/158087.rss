    <title>Making a non banning deob</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-non-banning-deob/158087</link>
    <description>ScarScape is a deobed client, but it
do NOT ban people for using it!
Sythe has the source/updater and knows the traps.
But, why don`t he want to share the updater or even the traps to the world?
Is he waiting for someone to buy the updater or?
That may born a Aryan like bot!
And other smalls bots that would be nice to check out.

Do anybody knows why people are not sharing such nice info?
BTW, I want to know how to import a deobed/undeobed clinent into my java application.
How can use BWCL, can you give me some sample pages or just write some samples here?</description>

              <p>I know that you can use an open source JDK as you don’t extend the classes but actually use them.</p>
<p>There again you extend the ActionListener interface so there must be some leeway.</p>
<p>Edit: There again we technically extend Object regardless of whether it is a class or interface as well as Applet in some cases. So under what circumstances would releasing a modified bot that was GPL’d force you to GPL the entire thing? You could for example, release a GPL’d bot that calls your close-source code. The bot cannot work  without the close code and so the entire thing is limited.</p>
<p>I’m a little confused here.</p>
<p>Edit2: I guess what we are doing is “dynamically linking” to other code. See here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License</a> under “GPL in Court”. Yes I know it is unlikely we would actually be able to enforce this but lets just have a hypothetical discussion.</p>
<p>Edit3: Looking at <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=3937" rel="nofollow noopener">http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=3937</a> it appears that java isn’t under the GPL but under a modified version. What that means is that you can link to it but if you write a program under the (full) GPL, the ball game changes.</p>
<p>Edit4: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-java.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-java.html</a> With LGPL inheritance and “linking” are the same thing. So that means that if calling a library’s constructor/method are allowed then they are allowed to extend/inherit. It would make sense that this similarity would be the same for the GPL so the question is are we allowed to “link” (call constructors/methods) from closed-source code with GPL’d code?</p>
<p>Edit5: Since extending is the same as implementing in the eyes of the GPL and according to this <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#OOPLang" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#OOPLang</a> all Aryan scripts must be released under the GPL. These scripts extend the abstract class Script which is under the GPL and therefore they are part of the GPL. This however does not make sense as I’m sure that someone has released closed-source modules for applications like eclipse.</p>

It’s debatable, OpenJDK is GPL’d right? Does that mean everything you make with it must be GPL’d? I don’t think so, but I could be wrong…</p>

<p>Also sythe did release the updater to the public, it is not open-source, but the updater pplsuqbawlz released is open source.
