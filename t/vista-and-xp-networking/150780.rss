    <title>Vista and Xp Networking</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vista-and-xp-networking/150780</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve recently been trying to network my vista so it will connect to my Xp desktop (to share a printer). I&#39;ve managed to install LLTD Responder on my Xp, so that i can view it on the vista network map. The only thing is i cannot access/connect to my Xp, although i can connect to my vista pc through my Xp.

Has anyone had this problem? I&#39;ve been searching for about 2 hours now and still haven&#39;t found a resolution.</description>
