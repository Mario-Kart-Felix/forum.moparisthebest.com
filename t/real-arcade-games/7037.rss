    <title>Real arcade games?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/real-arcade-games/7037</link>
    <description>Hey, My friend has realarcade, and asked me to see if maybe you could edit out the Real arcade part of it and just have the game.

I did google (all it mentioned was demo&#39;s and crap)

Anyways any help wouldbe appreciated and if this isnt possible to get the non realarcade version of the games then well yea lol

P.s. I can get the real version so maybe there is a peice of code or something you could remove?</description>
