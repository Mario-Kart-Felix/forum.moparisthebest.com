              <p>f*ck all that. when i started all i did was download my favorite servers source and start with no idea what i was doing. play around with it a bit. make sure you do a backup before everything you add incase you completely fail you have a copy to go back to. the more back ups the better.</p>
<p>and also if you ever need help with something that you reaaally cant figure out yourself then post here. i suggest though that you try to ask as little questions on here as possible. try to learn it yourself and google EVERYTHING before posting here. if all it takes is a simple google search to answer a question people wont like you very much around here haha</p>
<p>but goodluck for sure whatever you decide to do man!</p>

              <p>Don’t jump into it without knowing what you’re doing, like i did back in 2008.</p>
<p>If you really wan’t to get somewhere i suggest reading java tutorials on the internet, and watching video’s if you have trouble with reading for a long time.</p>
