    <title>Port forwarding Linksys Fast</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwarding-linksys-fast/378235</link>
    <description>Run Command Prompt and type this in:
[code=]ipconfig[/code]
You should see [code]IPv4 Address thing and it should say 192.168.2.?[/code]
the ? is the last digit of the 192.168.2. IP. remember that whole number.
Now, open a new internet explorer and type in the address bar: http://192.168.2.1/
Exactly like that. Now, you should see the side theres a bunch of things you should see &quot;Virtual Servers&quot; Click that.
It should say password, Now type in your password for your router, if you don&#39;t know it, then jsut leave it blank and click submit.Now, Scroll down you should see like Enable	 Description	 Inbound port	 Type	 Private IP address	  Private port Scroll down a bit more where theres an empty box, and type this in for the Description:
[code]Mopar[/code]
Now type this in for the inbound port:
[code]43594[/code]
OR
[code]5555[/code]
For the server port you&#39;re using, It should mainly be 43594.
So it should look just like
5.		Mopar           43594 - 43594  
Now, once yu have that filled out, set the type for Both (should be default)
Now, this is where the IP you memorized before comes in handy, remember the 
[code]192.168.2.?[/code] ?? 
Well whatever the last Digit in that IP is, type that last number in the Private Ip Address
Now for private port, put both of the boxes 43594 or 5555 depending on your server port it&#39;s running default 43594.
Okay, check mark the box all the way to the left and click Apply changes all the way at the bottom, it should work. After thats done go to this site to check to see if you portforwarded correctly.
[url]http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/[/url] And change the Port number to 43594 OR 5555 again depending on your server....
And click check, if you get a thumbs down you did something wrong, re read my tutorial and try again.
If you get a flag, the port is open and people can now connect to your server if you have a NO-IP Have fun and good luck with your server! 
Need any help? post it in a comment, thanks.</description>
