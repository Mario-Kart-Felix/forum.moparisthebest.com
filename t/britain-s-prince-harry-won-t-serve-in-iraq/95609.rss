&lt;blockquote&gt;LONDON - Britain’s Prince Harry will not be sent with his unit to Iraq, Britain’s top general said Wednesday, citing specific threats to the third in line to the throne and the risks to his fellow soldiers.

Gen. Sir Richard Dannatt, the army chief of staff who recently traveled to Iraq, said the changing situation on the ground exposed the prince to too much danger. Media scrutiny of Harry’s potential deployment exacerbated the situation, he said.

“There have been a number of specific threats, some reported and some not reported, that relate directly to Prince Harry as an individual,” Dannatt said. “These threats exposed him and those around him to a degree of risk I considered unacceptable.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>Did you even read his post? It wasn’t about Prince Harry dying, but his men. Unless they have some uber assasin they aren’t going to pick out Harry, they will probably just blow up the entire area he is in killing many people.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>But if that is going to happen surely Prince Harry staying or going will not make a difference. In fact if they are can blow up an entire area killing off a whole group of soldiers why haven’t the Iraqis done it already? Is it because the Prince is not there yet?[/quote]</p>
<p>A point I made earlier was, killing a royal family member would be much more, how do you say it, killing anybody would be good for them to do, however, if one of them killed a royal family member, it would be a much bigger thing.</p>
<p>So far, the worse they can do is grenade launchers and road-side bombs, road-side bombs are avoided by driving in the middle of the road witch is what a lot of troops do, and it takes a few seconds to aim with a grenade launcher giving troops time to kill them before they shoot. A royal family member would be a much bigger target than any usual troop.</p>

<p>I am also from britain, sorry for the misunderstanding, but I just dont think Royalty should be excluded from stuff like that, IMO, the Royals are only good for attracting tourists to Buckingham Palace and Windsor to walk around with cameras and take pictures of postboxes.<br>
I think the only inherited classes should be the ones used in OOP.</p>

<p>Because say, if the Iraqis find out were harry is staying they would bomb the building he was staying in, loads of hits allegedly have been put out on harrys life if he is sent to iraq, so lots more road side bombs just to get to him.</p>
<p>It was said, im not sure if it is true, that they put a car out and pretended harry was in it, it got targeted and shot and bombed.</p>

Like they would spot him if he looks like every other soldier in Iraq. I think he should go. How do you think every other soldier training to fight in the army would feel if he was given special treatment because of the family he was born into?<br>

<p>He’s a royal… why does everyone think they shouldn’t be given special treatment… Why should they be equal to us?</p>
<p>Also they dont need to know what he looks like, they can get the information on where he is and go “uber suicidal”.[/quote]</p>
<p>Royals are shit. They do less for this country then every other person so imo they should be treated the same as everyone else if not less important. Also at the moment the Iraqi rebels are already uber suicidal.</p>

I think he should serve, he’s no special, just another guy<br>
I bet he was feeling all big man when he joined, swinging his cock around like a 9-year old with his first erection, but as soon as a push turns to a shove, he turns tail and gets the army chief of staff to make up a story about ‘unacceptable risks’. I really don’t belive in a hightened danger of that magnitude.<br>
But I dont blame him, I wouldn’t go the Iraq either, but I still dont think its right that he gets special treatment.<br>

<p>He wants to fight, but they arnt letting him.</p>
<p>The point is, if he goes there is almost a 80% chance of more people than normal dieing just because of the Iraqis trying to kill him.[/quote]</p>
<p>You just made that 80% up… how to measure someones “targetness”.</p>
<p>I think it’s good to stop him from going. If he was killed it would be a big blow to us and the iraqis would be so pleased with themselves.</p>

<blockquote>LONDON - Britain’s Prince Harry will not be sent with his unit to Iraq, Britain’s top general said Wednesday, citing specific threats to the third in line to the throne and the risks to his fellow soldiers.
<p>Gen. Sir Richard Dannatt, the army chief of staff who recently traveled to Iraq, said the changing situation on the ground exposed the prince to too much danger. Media scrutiny of Harry’s potential deployment exacerbated the situation, he said.</p>
<p>“There have been a number of specific threats, some reported and some not reported, that relate directly to Prince Harry as an individual,” Dannatt said. “These threats exposed him and those around him to a degree of risk I considered unacceptable.”</p>
