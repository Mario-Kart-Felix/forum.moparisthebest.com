<blockquote>LONDON - Britain’s Prince Harry will not be sent with his unit to Iraq, Britain’s top general said Wednesday, citing specific threats to the third in line to the throne and the risks to his fellow soldiers.
<p>Gen. Sir Richard Dannatt, the army chief of staff who recently traveled to Iraq, said the changing situation on the ground exposed the prince to too much danger. Media scrutiny of Harry’s potential deployment exacerbated the situation, he said.</p>
<p>“There have been a number of specific threats, some reported and some not reported, that relate directly to Prince Harry as an individual,” Dannatt said. “These threats exposed him and those around him to a degree of risk I considered unacceptable.”</p>

        <p>I feel it’s a good reason, sure, his life isn’t worth more than the people that serve more than the people in the war, but if he is at more of risk, or more of a target, being our prince and all, then I don’t think we should send him just so if he gets killed the fucker that killed him can feel good 2 seconds before someone cries “BOOM HEAD SHOT!”.</p>

        <p>He joined the army to fight for his country. which he should do. Its not like he joined for the money.</p>
<p>there are lots of good reasons on both sides of the arguements.</p>
<p>For: He should fight because he joined to fight for his country And its not fair on anyone else if he gets to stay at home</p>
<p>Against: He might put soldiers at more risk then they already are. he would be a big target.</p>

<p>You just made that 80% up… how to measure someones “targetness”.</p>
<p>I think it’s good to stop him from going. If he was killed it would be a big blow to us and the iraqis would be so pleased with themselves.</p>

<p>Royals are shit. They do less for this country then every other person so imo they should be treated the same as everyone else if not less important. Also at the moment the Iraqi rebels are already uber suicidal.</p>

        <p>Its nothing to do with what the royals, army and goverment <em>WANT</em> its to do with what will be better for the other soldiers.</p>
<p>Because say, if the Iraqis find out were harry is staying they would bomb the building he was staying in, loads of hits allegedly have been put out on harrys life if he is sent to iraq, so lots more road side bombs just to get to him.</p>
<p>It was said, im not sure if it is true, that they put a car out and pretended harry was in it, it got targeted and shot and bombed.</p>

<p>Why are you so up the royals arses? They do nothing at all apart from live in a palace and get anything they want when they want. And now our brave Prince won’t go to war because some people believe if you are born “royal” you should be treated differently…</p>

<p>I am going to be VERY careful with the way I word this, we(the British) did NOT start the war, we do NOT need to serve in Iraq. I do not think calling OUR prince “queer” will get you any respect on these forums. [size=1pt]Fuck off back to runescape[/size]</p>

<p>Why are you so up the royals arses? They do nothing at all apart from live in a palace and get anything they want when they want. And now our brave Prince won’t go to war because some people believe if you are born “royal” you should be treated differently…[/quote]</p>
<p>Did you even read his post? It wasn’t about Prince Harry dying, but his men. Unless they have some uber assasin they aren’t going to pick out Harry, they will probably just blow up the entire area he is in killing many people.</p>

<p>But if that is going to happen surely Prince Harry staying or going will not make a difference. In fact if they are can blow up an entire area killing off a whole group of soldiers why haven’t the Iraqis done it already? Is it because the Prince is not there yet?</p>

<p>I am also from britain, sorry for the misunderstanding, but I just dont think Royalty should be excluded from stuff like that, IMO, the Royals are only good for attracting tourists to Buckingham Palace and Windsor to walk around with cameras and take pictures of postboxes.<br>
I think the only inherited classes should be the ones used in OOP.</p>
