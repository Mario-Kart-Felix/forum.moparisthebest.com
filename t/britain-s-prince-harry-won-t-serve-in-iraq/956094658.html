<p>I think he should serve, he’s no special, just another guy<br>
I bet he was feeling all big man when he joined, swinging his cock around like a 9-year old with his first erection, but as soon as a push turns to a shove, he turns tail and gets the army chief of staff to make up a story about ‘unacceptable risks’. I really don’t belive in a hightened danger of that magnitude.<br>
But I dont blame him, I wouldn’t go the Iraq either, but I still dont think its right that he gets special treatment.</p>

On our news, when it was announced he might go to Iraq, his regiment was around 50-100 men, that could be a lot of unnecessary deaths.</p>

<p>and I think Prince Harry is a queer who should go and maybe get killed… (depending on how you look at it)</p>

<p>I am going to be VERY careful with the way I word this, we(the British) did NOT start the war, we do NOT need to serve in Iraq. I do not think calling OUR prince “queer” will get you any respect on these forums. [size=1pt]Fuck off back to runescape[/size]</p>
<p>Again, I don’t want this to get political.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why are you so up the royals arses? They do nothing at all apart from live in a palace and get anything they want when they want. And now our brave Prince won’t go to war because some people believe if you are born “royal” you should be treated differently…</p>

</aside>
<p>Did you even read his post? It wasn’t about Prince Harry dying, but his men. Unless they have some uber assasin they aren’t going to pick out Harry, they will probably just blow up the entire area he is in killing many people.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>But if that is going to happen surely Prince Harry staying or going will not make a difference. In fact if they are can blow up an entire area killing off a whole group of soldiers why haven’t the Iraqis done it already? Is it because the Prince is not there yet?[/quote]</p>
<p>A point I made earlier was, killing a royal family member would be much more, how do you say it, killing anybody would be good for them to do, however, if one of them killed a royal family member, it would be a much bigger thing.</p>
<p>So far, the worse they can do is grenade launchers and road-side bombs, road-side bombs are avoided by driving in the middle of the road witch is what a lot of troops do, and it takes a few seconds to aim with a grenade launcher giving troops time to kill them before they shoot. A royal family member would be a much bigger target than any usual troop.</p>

<p>Look, as I said before, I don’t know what the hierarchy of USA is so I can’t explain it to you. I couldn’t give a toss about the royals, however treason is still a crime here.</p>

        <p>He is only third in line for the throne, I don’t think his death would be much worse than any of the other soldiers deaths, if he wants to go he should. The only problem with this is that he is a target, he could get his comrades killed because of that - which is why he shouldn’t go.</p>
