    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-194/265109</link>
    <description>Hey, first, if this is the wrong section.. move it.

I need the 194 server, I have the cache and client all working great but I want to code features. I know ones out there because I had one before but deleted it before I got the cache. Thanks in advance</description>

<p>194 was when classic was still the main picture and rs2 was in beta. It’s the first cache that isn’t RSC(i think) and it goes way before 317. Just think… It had to have started at 1 with the beta/release of RSC or if it was ever released, devious mud.(I’m not sure if deviousMUD was on the same path as runescape but all I know is there are MANY cache versions but the servers just pick and choose the main caches to code)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 01, 2009, 12:15:33 am[/size][hr]sooooooooooooo server plawks?</p>
