    <description>How can i do that when u press on an NPC, it asks: &quot;Do you want to buy beer?&quot; And that when u press &quot;no&quot;, conversation gets closed, but that when u press &quot;Yes&quot;, 2 coins go away of ur inventory and u get a beer. And when u don&#39;t got enough, the NPC says: &quot;You don&#39;t have enough gold&quot; en then when u press next, conversation gets closed.

And, please give me the right code. Before this one, someone else gaved me a wrong code, and me server got f*cked up. Couldn&#39;t compile. But luckily, i could delete the codes, and me server got fine.

And if u need this: Im using 317 HomieScape!!</description>
