    <title>Items Disappearing in Nether</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/items-disappearing-in-nether/406299</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not quite sure how the nether works, but I was recently killed by a ghast in the Nether. I saw my items pop out into a safe place. I respawned and was able to make it back to the Nether in under a minute. I went to where I died, and my items were gone. Is that normal?</description>

<p>No, I saw some items pop into my tunnel entrance about 3 blocks away. In fact, I don’t think there was any fire. I just saw the fireball, braced for impact, and when it hit me, I died, but I didn’t see any fire on the ground.</p>
