    <title>Drove into someone, what do</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/drove-into-someone-what-do/445112</link>
    <description>Just what I needed, ran into the back of someone today, albeit at only about 5mph (traffic jammed), I was scared shitless and he indicated to pull over so I did the same, not knowing what to do, and he got out so well, I did too.


He looked at me and then inspected his car, touched it a bit, absolutely no damage, I did the same, all good in the hood.
So then he asked for registration and insurance numbers, I questioned him why for a bit, he responded with &#39;oh I&#39;ll get it checked over at the garage and if there&#39;s anything wrong with it I&#39;ll get back to you&#39; and just gave in, again, I am clueless in these situations.


I wrote down his registration too, y&#39;know just in case, but he took my name, phone no (insurance docs were at home), and car reg.


I was deeply apologetic and all cause well, it was my fault, but what should I have done anyone?  Again, never been in this situation at all before.


ps. I drive a micra k11 sport.</description>

<p>I call b/s, you ain’t getting 4l/100km out of a corolla, maybe 5.5 if it is a pre 2000 model but definitely not on the newer models. The newer ones use 7+L/100km, you claim to be in prius territory.</p>
<p>My 1988 Corolla 4A-GE uses usually 7l/100km but down to 5.9L/100km on long trips.</p>

<p>What I don’t get is that, if stopping distance is longer in rain for you, wouldn’t it also be longer for them, negating the need for a greater time gap? It is probably more to do with the fact that you will take longer to react when it is raining, due to poor visibility…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>on paper it seems the longer braking would negate the need for a longer stopping distance but in the real world there’s more variables when it’s wet than when it’s dry hence the need for a longer stopping distance</p>
<p>some of those variables include different tyres providing different amounts of grip when wet, some brake pads not being as efficient as they can be when wet, poor visibility, diesel on tyres (although this is mostly for motorbikes) etc</p>
