    <title>Rune crafting code?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rune-crafting-code/201970</link>
    <description>ok i want to make rune crafting skill.here is what i want to do.


When player has rune essense     (rune essense id =1436)
they click craft on alter              (alter id =2478)
it then gives them one air rune ( air rune code = 556)
and it gives them 500xp in runecrafting skill
and it deletes 1 rune essence.

so if anyone would know how to do this i would greatly appreciate it, I tried this code, but it doesnt seem to be working.

&lt;blockquote&gt;case 2478:
      if(GoodDistance2(absX, absY, objectX, objectY, 3)) {
                                        if ((playerHasItemAmount(1436, 1) == true)) {
               sendMessage(&quot;You Make air Runes&quot;);
               stillgfx(247, absY, absX);
               PlayerHandler.messageToAll = (playerName + &quot; Has crafted some air runes&quot;);
               addItem(556, 1);
                                        deleteItem(1436, GetItemSlot(1436), 1);
               startAnimation(422);
               updateRequired = true;
               appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
         } else {
            sendMessage(&quot;You need rune essense to make air runes&quot;);
                        }
                  }
                        break;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
