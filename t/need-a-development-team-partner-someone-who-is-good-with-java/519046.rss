    <title>Need a Development Team/Partner (Someone Who is Good With Java!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-development-team-partner-someone-who-is-good-with-java/519046</link>
    <description>I am looking for another person to start up a very successful server with. I can cover most of the things required for starting a server, but I need someone who is very good with Java. Here are all the things I can handle:


[ul][li]Website Development on a Professional Level (I&#39;ve done it professionally for six years, can do just about ANYTHING.)[/li]
[li]Networking and Managing The Server (This includes setting up and maintaining the VPS and other networking features.)[/li]
[li]Wonderful Ideas (Throughout my whole life, I&#39;ve been told I have great ideas, I have tons of ideas I&#39;m wanting to try for a RSPS, I just need someone to do the Java part and partner up with me.)[/li]
[li]Some Java Knowledge (I know how the RSPS servers work and the structure on which they&#39;re built. I know minimal things primarily pertaining to SQL and JDBC drivers for Java. I can also efficiently make a server run from SQL databases.)[/li]
[li]Graphical Design (I am a Website Developer, but also a Website Designer, yes, there is a difference. I even go to the extent to physically draw images, scan them, and enhance them with a computer, to use for some of my websites.)[/li][/ul]


I have lots of good skills, I just need someone who is good with Java, we will make an amazing team. Let me know if you&#39;re good with Java and leadership, all profits, and control is split evenly, neither of us will have more power over the other. I find that the best way to have a successful server is to have a staff team that can work together, efficiently, and successfully.</description>
