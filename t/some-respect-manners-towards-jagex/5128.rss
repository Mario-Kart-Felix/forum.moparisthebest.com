    <title>Some respect &amp; manners towards JAGeX?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-respect-manners-towards-jagex/5128</link>
    <description>First of all - this isn&#39;t a plea or a demand. I wouldn&#39;t even call it a request. I&#39;d call it civil/social/communal advice.

Obviously, not all of this community is doing it, and there&#39;s a minority (30%) that persist on doing it.

To point out the blatantly clear â€“ the reason most of us have met each other, made friends and had â€˜good timesâ€™ is because of; JAGeX.

Most of you have tried, attempted, succeeded or failed at Java programming. As we all know, Runescape, and every other JAGeX game was programmed in Java. Itâ€™s pretty safe to say that the JAGeX programmers are all far better programmers than us. Fact. Maybe, if I put it into an analogy youâ€™d all understand, since when did Yoda called Darth Vader â€œDarth GAYderâ€, and when has Dumbledore ever made remarks about Voldemortâ€™s sexual preference? Never.

Maybe those analogies were a little out of place, but they get the point across well. In the eyes of the people I am addressing this to; JAGeX are our enemies (which, on the contrary, they are not). So, you all go and make up highly humorous names such as â€œFAGeXâ€ â€œJAGSeXâ€ or others relating to the companies sexual preference. Which I find illogical in the fact that: Surely an entity canâ€™t have a sexual preference; and if youâ€™re talking to the people that work there, youâ€™re implying that you have to be homosexual to work for JAGeX? Uhh, I think theyâ€™d be sued for discrimination by now, donâ€™t you?

Going off on a slight tangent, I see you give them names relating to sexual preference, and that this is one of homosexual orientation. Whatâ€™s wrong with homosexuality? Surely itâ€™s just your lack of social experience that you canâ€™t accept something youâ€™re not told in story books, or growing up as a kid? Welcome to the real world.

Also, you should thank JAGeX for the programming challenge they present you, or for them aspiring you into wanting to do something other than play a game. Learn from the best.

As I repeat, this was aimed towards the minority of users that persist on doing this, and to be frank. I donâ€™t see how you can still do it after reading this post.

If you have other queries youâ€™d like me to address, then post it, and Iâ€™ll try and resolve it for you.

So maybe you should take this post into account? As if you continue to do it, itâ€™ll really just boil down to immaturity, as will the homosexual slandering.</description>

<p>Yes JAGeX do there best to stop us, or the actual cheaters, and need to see what we’re producing so they can detect it, yes it’s well known they’ve noted these forums, it can be annoying but what can you do?</p>

              <p>First of all - this isn’t a plea or a demand. I wouldn’t even call it a request. I’d call it civil/social/communal advice.</p>
<p>Obviously, not all of this community is doing it, and there’s a minority (30%) that persist on doing it.</p>
<p>To point out the blatantly clear â€“ the reason most of us have met each other, made friends and had â€˜good timesâ€™ is because of; JAGeX.</p>
<p>Most of you have tried, attempted, succeeded or failed at Java programming. As we all know, Runescape, and every other JAGeX game was programmed in Java. Itâ€™s pretty safe to say that the JAGeX programmers are all far better programmers than us. Fact. Maybe, if I put it into an analogy youâ€™d all understand, since when did Yoda called Darth Vader â€œDarth GAYderâ€, and when has Dumbledore ever made remarks about Voldemortâ€™s sexual preference? Never.</p>
<p>Maybe those analogies were a little out of place, but they get the point across well. In the eyes of the people I am addressing this to; JAGeX are our enemies (which, on the contrary, they are not). So, you all go and make up highly humorous names such as â€œFAGeXâ€ â€œJAGSeXâ€ or others relating to the companies sexual preference. Which I find illogical in the fact that: Surely an entity canâ€™t have a sexual preference; and if youâ€™re talking to the people that work there, youâ€™re implying that you have to be homosexual to work for JAGeX? Uhh, I think theyâ€™d be sued for discrimination by now, donâ€™t you?</p>
<p>Going off on a slight tangent, I see you give them names relating to sexual preference, and that this is one of homosexual orientation. Whatâ€™s wrong with homosexuality? Surely itâ€™s just your lack of social experience that you canâ€™t accept something youâ€™re not told in story books, or growing up as a kid? Welcome to the real world.</p>
<p>Also, you should thank JAGeX for the programming challenge they present you, or for them aspiring you into wanting to do something other than play a game. Learn from the best.</p>
<p>As I repeat, this was aimed towards the minority of users that persist on doing this, and to be frank. I donâ€™t see how you can still do it after reading this post.</p>
<p>If you have other queries youâ€™d like me to address, then post it, and Iâ€™ll try and resolve it for you.</p>
<p>So maybe you should take this post into account? As if you continue to do it, itâ€™ll really just boil down to immaturity, as will the homosexual slandering.</p>
