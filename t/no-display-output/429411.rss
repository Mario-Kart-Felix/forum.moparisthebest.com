    <title>No display output</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-display-output/429411</link>
    <description>So I have a desktop PC in my room that&#39;s just been laying there for a while, running Windows Vista Basic, so yes she&#39;s a low spec babe.

Basically, no display output on boot, at all, tried 3 different monitors, all the same.
It has integrated graphics, also tried a dedicated video card with each of the monitors, results were the same.

Tried RAM checks, taking both out causes post beeps, also tried every combination in different slots (only 2 sticks of 1gb each).
USB output is functioning properly, well, at least my wireless adapter and usb memory sticks both light up anyway.
Reset the CMOS battery (took out for 10 minutes and put back in).

It&#39;s all clean inside, not that that&#39;s entirely relevant.
Cannot get into bios because of no display.

Also tried removing floppy drives, dvd drives, and hard drives in every combination.  Basically stripped it down to just cpu and the ram to no avail.

The only thing I haven&#39;t tried is stripping it out of the case completely and booting it barebones on an anti static surface, but that&#39;s a task and a half and can&#39;t really be bothered.  But would that be any different?  Especially considering it&#39;s a pre built branded acer machine, never been opened before.

Possible dead motherboard?  Suggestions?</description>

<p>Ooh, see if I can rob one from college, as well as a multimeter for the test, cheers I’ll report back soon.</p>
<p>Edit: haven’t gone to college yet but it turns out my dad has a multimeter, well, 2.  Only they’re pretty bad as they only give a single digit and no decimal places.<br>
Tested 24 pin connector to motherboard and that reported 5 VDC and sometimes 2 depending on which wire tested.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/power-supply-voltage-tolerances-2624583" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Power Supply Voltage Tolerances</a></h3>

<p>A list of power supply voltage tolerances. Included are tolerances for the +/- 12VDC, +/- 5VDC, +5 VSB, and +3.3VDC voltages output by a computer PSU.</p>

  <div class="onebox-metadata">
    
    
  </div>
  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>

<p>The tolerance there states that none of them should be below 3.1, and they should be no more than 5.2.</p>
<p>Also tested a 4 pin connector (possibly for pci), and could not get any readings at all from that, using every combination.  And yes it was coming straight from the power supply.</p>
<p>Don’t know if dead or not? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  Gonna ask at college for an actual power supply tester tomorrow.</p>
<p>edit2: <span class="bbcode-b">power supply is perfectly fine.</span></p>
