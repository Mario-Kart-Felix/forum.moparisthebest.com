    <description>I need a bit of help getting my webclient fixed.  :P

Everytime I run my Webclient, I get this screen where as my cache is not reliable.

Pictures + Explaination:
Loading Webclient as I click Run Java, this is what happens after:

However, I bypass this by pressing Yes and I get this screen:

But fortunately I can also bypass that by click on it, which gives me this screen:

I can also bypass that screen and play when I press Reload. This is a pain just doing this, is there a way I can fix this for good?
I just want those errors to get out of my way.

[b]Any help would be wanted, and appreciated. [/b]</description>
