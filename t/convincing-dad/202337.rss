    <title>Convincing Dad?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/convincing-dad/202337</link>
    <description>Hey, I need a way to convince my father to let me purchase a Leatt Neck Brace. I&#39;ve always believed it is safety first, especially with Motocross. Dad doesn&#39;t think I need one because apparently the one I have now is fine. I don&#39;t though, I know they offer a little bit of protection, but I have proof to show they hardly work.

I currently have the neckroll:

What I am trying to convince my father to let me get is quite pricy, though. Up around near the $1000 AU dollar mark:
[img]http://www.motorcycle-superstore.com/ProductImages/300/2008_Leatt_Moto_GPX_Club_Neck_Brace_Black.jpg[/img]

I was talking with the guy at our local motocross shop and he told me it&#39;s safer to not wear a neck roll because it&#39;s a real hard squishy sort of foam. He said that in the occurrence of a crash the riders neck compresses the neck roll and the neck roll snaps back. Causing basically twice the whiplash.

I know Leatt Neck braces work, but getting the message over to my father is difficult. He thinks I don&#39;t need one, but I would really like one. The neck roll is extremely uncomfortable, and makes your neck sore as hell. I have tried a Leatt neck brace on, and it&#39;s so comfortable, you&#39;re neck and upper back is so supported.

If someone could help me do some research and try to find some facts that may convince him, I&#39;d extremely appreciate it. I hardly ask for anything, as I am extremely spoiled by just having such a dirtbike and all my gear, but I have worked for all of that, and a lot of stuff is paid for by my sponsor, well only the trailer was, but oh well.

So far I have convinced mum and she said she will try and help me convince dad. I showed mum the facts, and the local Motocross shop helped by showing her what happens.</description>

<p>It could be either but, what you’re saying just backs up my point that proofread is just concatenated because it can be and not because it’s an actual word.</p>

<p>AFAIK Yz85Racer needs no further answers in regard to his original question and this has therefore been locked.</p>

</aside>
<p>I missed a ‘y’ off the end noticeably, I thought you had noticed when you said “Little noticeable wrong?” but obviously you didn’t.  My mistake was also yours.</p>
<blockquote>Opera is catered to an audience that can spell better than a fifth grader.</blockquote>
Well in that case, Firefox wins! If Opea is catered to a single audience yet Firefox gives the user a choice then it is obviously suited to all or more audiences.
<blockquote>What does the "read" in "proof read" function as in the sentence?  In terms of n., v., adj., adv., etc.</blockquote>
I'm unaware of where your from, your profile says NJ which I can only presume is New Jersey (sp?), however English has no specified rules of sentence structure in regards too "In terms of n., v., adj., adv., etc" in fact I'm not even sure what you were trying to say there. I apologise of course for my apparent lack of knowledge, I stopped taking English last year when I took up 4 of the hardest subjects possible. Clearly, sentence structure is everything.
<p>Proving intelligence, as you should know is near to impossible (between people of a similar level). Hence why I said “More than possibly”, so either you’re not all that intelligent, or you failed to read those words, in which case you’re either an idiot or ignorant. Granted, I recognise you are an intelligent individual, I just merely do not agree with the presumption you take of me being less intelligent than you.</p>
<p>Debating around the word “proofread”, this is certainly a new feat.</p>

</aside>
<p>Opera has no built-in spell checker, and I have no patience to figure out installing dictionaries to do so.  And I don’t need to look up a word that’s been in my vocabulary since middle school.  Little noticeable wrong?  Do you notice anything wrong in this sentence:  I ate a pan cake this morning.  Exactly.  Try to pin my superior spelling skills on some external source; I can’t POSSIBLY just be naturally more intelligent than you are.</p>
