    <description>Here&#39;s a few I shot from our trip to Louisiana. There&#39;s even more on my newest site update. They&#39;re a little big to show here.

It&#39;s pretty much typical up-close-and-personal photography.
They were all shot with my Cosina Macro 100/3.5, with the exception of the ones of the boy (my cousin&#39;s son), which were shot with my Minolta 50/1.4. And they were all either wide open (3.5/1.4) or stopped down (4/1.7), so the DOF is very limited.

PS: haha I just this noticed on the third picture here. Near the bottom right there&#39;s area that&#39;s in focus like the flowers to the left. The little flower that&#39;s one of a kind in that picture. My new favorite part. I didn&#39;t even realize that much was in focus.

PPS: I just shrunk them for you guys on lower rez. They&#39;re all 1800x1200 photos for 4x6 printing, sized down from about 4Kx4K. Now these are 1280 wide.</description>

<p>These pictures are really nice, The definition on that Lizards eye is Epic!<br>
My only critisim is how the small childs ear is out of focus which doesnt look good.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s not the camera used…<br>
I used my old Sony a100.</p>
<p>Little boy’s ear couldn’t have been more in focus unless I stopped the aperture down a LOT more, which I didn’t because that would shoot the ISO past 800 introducing tons of noise or the shutter down to about 1". Then there’s not really a picture anymore.</p>
<p>You just have to come to love small DOF portraits. I have.</p>
