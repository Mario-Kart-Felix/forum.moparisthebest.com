    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/something-that-is-bugging-me/236504</link>
    <description>Ok well after school everyday me and my friends gf hangs out.. and well while we are just sitting there talking with other people she tells me to turn her up side down.. well i do and then she puts her legs so they are on each shoulder then she pulls her self up so her pussy is right in front of my mouth.. well i always thought there for awhile she just wanted to have some fun.. and well today when we were with 3 of our friends she tells me to do it again.. i do and then this time she slides down with her legs around me and then kisses me on the way down.. only her friend saw it, well i have never thought about anything between us, until today, but i am still worried about if she really does like me or if she is just teasing.. Its weird because she always seems like she is flirting with me but i have no idea if she really is, she doesn&#39;t do it with her bf, and only does it with me.. i am needing some help here.. they have been dating for around a month now and they have only kissed a few times.. idk what to do.. i want to date her but i dont wana destroy a friend ship in the making.. its not only my friendship with her bf but also her, and between her and her friend that likes me too... so can you guys give me some helpful hints on this?</description>

Whatever. I guess I’ll be logical.</p>
<p>First of all, what you don’t want to do is tell your friend that she’s doing this. You might see it as lying, but it’s better to say nothing at all at points like this. Choose whether you want your friendship with her, and with her boyfriend (also your friend), or to date her and lower your relationship value with your other friend (her boyfriend).</p>
<p>I’m going to tell you right now, if she’s doing this to you while she’s going out with him, she’s not girlfriend material. Not saying she isn’t respectable as a person or a friend, but if she’s doing this, she isn’t very loyal with her bonds on men.</p>
<p>Try avoiding situations like that in the future by the way. That is, if you want to make the best of your friendship among the three of you. Remember, bros before hoes.<br>

              <p>Ok well after school everyday me and my friends gf hangs out… and well while we are just sitting there talking with other people she tells me to turn her up side down… well i do and then she puts her legs so they are on each shoulder then she pulls her self up so her pussy is right in front of my mouth… well i always thought there for awhile she just wanted to have some fun… and well today when we were with 3 of our friends she tells me to do it again… i do and then this time she slides down with her legs around me and then kisses me on the way down… only her friend saw it, well i have never thought about anything between us, until today, but i am still worried about if she really does like me or if she is just teasing… Its weird because she always seems like she is flirting with me but i have no idea if she really is, she doesn’t do it with her bf, and only does it with me… i am needing some help here… they have been dating for around a month now and they have only kissed a few times… idk what to do… i want to date her but i dont wana destroy a friend ship in the making… its not only my friendship with her bf but also her, and between her and her friend that likes me too… so can you guys give me some helpful hints on this?</p>
