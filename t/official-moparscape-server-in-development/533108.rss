    <title>Official MoparScape Server - In Development</title>

    <description>OPEN ALPHA STARTS SATURDAY: http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20150110T13&amp;p0=234&amp;msg=First+Open+Alpha

Throughout the course of pretty much all of MoparScape&#39;s existence, there has always been talk about having an official server hosted that people can play on and/or help develop. Thanks to the staff team and a handful of developers, the stage has been set to finally make this dream a reality. More about this project will be added to the topic as people ask questions and such, just remember that not very much has been set in stone yet in regards to how everything will be handled.

The current goal of this project is to create a private server to be hosted and publicly accessible, linked to the forums in many ways (most notably, logging in with the same account). There will also be an open source script system, allowing [i]anyone[/i] the opportunity to contribute to the server. 

[anchor=INFO][size=18pt][u][b]Server Info:[/b][/u][/size]
The server will be revision [b]530[/b]. The date of this revision is January 28th, 2009. This is not currently subject to change.
The server supports LD and HD (using OpenGL).
The server is based on [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,648281.0.html]RuneEmu[/url] (evelus) by sinisoul, which is itself based on [url=http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs-503-client-server/downloads/492138-scapeemulator.html]ScapeEmulator[/url] by Graham and his brother.

Go crazy.
[quote=&quot;Davidi2&quot;]That said, I would really appreciate it if people don&#39;t just insult me for poor design choices, instead at least suggest a better one or... submit a pull request! I&#39;ve been doing a lot of this solo so I don&#39;t always think everything through, just trying to be pragmatic. 

If you see a flaw in game logic, that&#39;s something I really want pointed out (looking at you silab baby pls) so I can prevent as many bugs/dupes/abuses etc before we get into any sort of launch phase.

Also I apologize for the lack of commenting. Expect it up either today or at the very least before Wednesday (I have an 8 hour orientation tomorrow...)[/quote]

[anchor=APPLICATION][size=18pt][u][b]Pre-alpha application:[/b][/u][/size]
I&#39;m looking for a few people that can help me test things before we launch the public alpha version of the server. If accepted, you will receive a password for your account that can be used to log into the server whenever it is online. I will also send out PMs to all that are accepted whenever I am planning on having the server on for any extended length of time.

What is pre-alpha? Pre-alpha is basically the stage before we&#39;re ready to open the server up to the public at all. There is a miniscule amount of content, we just need people willing to test the bits of content that we have completed. And of course being accepted here means you will be accepted into any later access sessions as well.

[u][b]APPLICATIONS CURRENTLY CLOSED[/b][/u]

[anchor=TODO][size=18pt][u][b]What&#39;s left?[/b][/u][/size]
Unlike previous official server ideas, this server is not starting from scratch. That means the chances that the development will fizzle out are much lower. Pretty much the entire core is complete.
So what is left besides content (which anyone can help develop when we get to that point)?
[u][b]TODO for pre alpha:[/b][/u]
More shop definitions
More NPC definitions/spawns (maybe make some drops too)
[s]Equipment level requirements[/s] [b]DONE[/b]
[s]Equipment bonuses[/s] [b]DONE[/b]
More magic definitions
Prayer (maybe)
Actual hit chance calculations
[s]Friends lists/PMing[/s] [b]DONE[/b]
After those are done, content creation can begin in full swing!

[anchor=DEVELOPERS][size=18pt][u][b]Developers:[/b][/u][/size]
As this project has just really begun, sinisoul and myself have been the only ones really working on the source at the moment. Others, such as Method, Lothy, and Moparisthebest have also weighed in a bit with advice/tips/ideas. 

And of course a huge thank you and shout-out to Graham and his brother for creating the original source!

Not trying to be a dick, but I’m not surprised people don’t contribute. When I tried putting this online a few months ago it didn’t even have compile/run instructions, and nobody could give them to me even when I asked.

Good developers are used to clean efficient environments and if they have any sense wont waste a second of their time with bullshit like manual table creation.<br>

I don’t recall you asking for compile or run instructions, but it really shouldn’t be hard… There are no command line arguments to worry about, config files are in the repo, an archive of dependencies is in the repo readme, and it should be as simple as adding the unzipped dependencies file to your IDE build path for the project.

<p>Exactly. I pushed the maven pom so that people wouldn’t have to do that extra step. It certainly helped me out. I’m not sure about the database though. I could write up different types of repositories for the different data. SQL, XML, etc.</p>

It’s a shame. I get a lot of private messages from people that want me to dump the database or do X or do Y so that they can more easily work on it for themselves, but none of those people are actually contributing to the repo.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Honestly, if they can’t configure their development environments then they aren’t good enough to be contributing to the project.</p>
<p>Not the nicest thing to say about people, but it’s certainly the truth.[/quote]To be fair if the database has a complex structure it would just be a waste of time to do it yourself. But if they’re not contributing then that’s not really time-saved that was well-spent</p>
