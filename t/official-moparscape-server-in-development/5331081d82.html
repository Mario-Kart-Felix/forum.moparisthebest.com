<p>I quit on my own terms and told Tom that if he and David organized something in the future I wouldn’t mind helping out. I can’t devote so much time to a project under the hope that it hits big and makes a lot of ad revenue (which is what the deal was). So if you feel inclined to create a top notch quality product that is easy to develop on, then by all means go ahead and do it. A lot of the time when I abandon a project is because: It’s becoming too much for me to handle or the original objectives I had for it are falling out of place.</p>

        <p>I don’t know if I’d be inclined to blame the admins, Tom did a really good job with keeping on page with me.

I asked to switch to a revision that was more researched and understood (317) but they didn’t want to scrap what we already made. Which I understand, but it was just too much stress on my part. I didn’t want to release a product to the public that was just ‘Okay’, because then it wouldn’t really help exemplify what I think the communities potential could be.

<p>Yea, I understand that. From doing my 530 project, I’ve realized that it just needs too much work and dedication put into it, which it’s not worth as it might not even go anywhere. Unless you have that time, dedication and skill, I’d suggest, to everyone, do a more documented revision such as 317, 474 and 718 (there are more, but those are just the most common).</p>

        <p>I wanted to just keep working on the version we had going, but if Mopar/Tom still haven’t made a decision about what base to use I don’t want to waste my time working on something that wont get used, nomsain?</p>
<p>I said it in the development forum and I’ll say it here, I thought sinisoul had overly high expectations for what we needed in an official server. Basically he wanted an ‘official base’ that was programmed perfectly, but I was under the impression we were working towards an ‘official server’, functional and fun to play, less about overall design. That is a rather huge difference in view from a development standpoint and I can’t blame him at all for leaving.</p>

I wanted to just keep working on the version we had going, but if Mopar/Tom still haven’t made a decision about what base to use I don’t want to waste my time working on something that wont get used, nomsain?</p>
<p>I said it in the development forum and I’ll say it here, I thought sinisoul had overly high expectations for what we needed in an official server. Basically he wanted an ‘official base’ that was programmed perfectly, but I was under the impression we were working towards an ‘official server’, functional and fun to play, less about overall design. That is a rather huge difference in view from a development standpoint and I can’t blame him at all for leaving.</p>
<p>I still believe we just need a playable official server.<br>

<p>Yeah, this. We had conflict of interests which is fine but it kinda shot us in the foot. No offense David &lt;3 <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>I don’t know if I’d be inclined to blame the admins, Tom did a really good job with keeping on page with me. At the time the revision we wanted to do was not really well known and I have an OCD where I have to know the most efficient way to do everything. I asked to switch to a revision that was more researched and understood (317) but they didn’t want to scrap what we already made. Which I understand, but it was just too much stress on my part. I didn’t want to release a product to the public that was just ‘Okay’, because then it wouldn’t really help exemplify what I think the communities potential could be. David wanted me to put in the basics but honestly in the end I think ‘Set a solid foundation’ for something like this is more pertinent.</p>
<p>Also there were other talks about buying another base, I reviewed it, was not pleased with the way content was developed so I gave a strong recommendation to not move forward with it but that’s a different story. The point where we stand (or stood, I’m not really in the loop with what’s going on) is that MITB wants to use Osiris. There’s a TON of legacy code in Osiris that needs redoing and in my honest opinion it’s just scrap since the latest improvements we’ve had in technology/strategy during the last few years. But shh, don’t tell him that. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>He gets what he wants, it’s his site. If you are a good developer and feel like slitting your wrists hit Tom up about helping.</p>

<p>He’s been begging to use Osiris for the past 3 years.</p>
<p>I swear, talk about conservative.</p>

He paid a LOT for it a LONG while ago.</p>
