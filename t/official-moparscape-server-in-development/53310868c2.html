I don’t know why 06scape failed (unless you are talking about 2006scape in which case they got shut down by jagex), but people not wanting to invest time in a server can be about more than just their xp rate.</p>
<p>I am pretty adamant about starting the server off somewhere in the 1.5-3x range, which can be decided with a vote, and then after a bit if people want higher it can be raised very easily. The other way is not possible without doing things like lowering existing player stats to make it fair to others, which is obviously not ideal.<br>
[/quote]Your server worked because it was before the official Old School Server came out, so people didn’t mind to grind those old skills because it had been <span class="bbcode-i">years</span> since most of those people played the old Runescape. I can guarantee you a slow XP rate will hamper the ammount of players you have.</p>
<p>If people wanted to grind, they wouldn’t do it on a private server they would play the real game. And I was talking about Ry’s remake 2007scape.[/quote]<br>
Differences:<br>
This server is 2009, so it appeals to people that don’t like OSRS but also don’t like EoC<br>
This server doesn’t require membership like OSRS or EoC<br>
This server will still be faster training than OSRS or EoC</p>
<p>You can get 99 cooking in a week or two pretty easily in real runescape, with a 3x xp rate you’re looking at 500-700k xp per hour meaning you could get 99 in about a days playtime. Combat skills will take longer like always, but unless this turns into a PvP server there’s no reason you need to have max combat stats in a few hours. At that point you might as well just give people commands to set their stats.</p>
<p>And again, this game REVOLVES around grinding. Unless you completely change the point of the game like the hunger games server or make it a pvp server or w/e, if you are giving everyone virtually free maxing there is no longer any point to play after a week. If people don’t like how the game is played they probably shouldn’t play it, right? If the want isn’t here for an official server then I can just stop working on it. Or if it turns out the server is small (which is a possibility considering the scene is dying) and the majority just want to PvP or have set stat and spawn commands, we can give it to them and be done with it. Right now I’m just trying to create a game that has playability and will work best for a server.</p>

<p>Obviously you can tell my stance about it, but a grindy-private server that may not even last a year sounds like a waste of time to me.</p>

<p>Obviously you can tell my stance about it, but a grindy-private server that may not even last a year sounds like a waste of time to me.[/quote]I can confirm that I would quit a server in a few minutes that tried and made me play for months just to become the best. You’re forgetting, David, that we aren’t all 10 year olds anymore that can piss away 8 hours a day on a game with hardly any kind of future. I get it, you think this server is going to be big and want there to be players of all skill level on the server, not everyone maxed out and quitting because there’s nothing to do. You also want there to exist lots of low-leveled activities like killing cows and chickens because it’s nostalgic, and you spent all that time programming those things so you don’t want them to go to waste. But if you tried to make me do low-leveled stuff for ages that I’ve already done before just to get where I’ve been, and take away tons of my time at that, you’re mistaken. Your server will lack players if this is the approach you take.</p>
<p>Find a middle ground. Increase the max skill level to 135 or something, or make the rates dependent on your level, like most servers do. But don’t give the same grindy feel as RuneScape with less than 1% of its playerbase to help break out the grind, very few quests in comparison, most of the game missing, and no future.</p>

        <p>Here’s the pro and cons table:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Fast xp rate</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Pros:</span><br>
People that ‘dont want to grind’ are happier (and frankly we don’t even know if that’s the majority or minority, we’ve only had 3 people talk about it)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Cons:</span><br>
Removes competitive aspect of the game<br>
Limits server sustainability (because people finish the content so much faster)<br>
Removes worth of all midgame content<br>
Messes with the economy</p>
<p>@ Lin - Again, a medium xp rate doesn’t require you to sit and grind like you would in old RS. You can get 1-80 in pretty much any skill in probably less than a couple hours. If you want to be one of the people that grinds for the really high stats after that then that can be your thing, why take away that competitive aspect of the game because some people want to be the best with no effort? Again, it’s virtually the same idea as letting people ::max, there are servers that it is meant for, and one like this where we are going to try and create all sorts of content is not it. Also no, I’m not basing any of this on nostalgia, it’s just the game design.</p>
<p>It’s frustrating that the argument is based around the idea that people are only going to play for a month, because you’re just setting yourself up for a self-fulfilling prophecy there. “Well this game will probably only last a month we should probably design it around that”, and then you have no way out if it turns out to be popular. That’s why starting it out lower and raising it if that’s what it needs is the better choice, imo.</p>

        <p>umm. str8 up. if the xp rate is low - simply implement methods that break the grind for all skills or allow the use of macros.</p>
<p>such as campfires , how it iterates through everything. i dont want to have to constantly click back and forth for small xp.</p>
<p>and then for your “grindy” skills like cooking/herblore/farming etc - maybe have a multiplier for the time aswell?</p>

        <p>I think the biggest concern people have is the combat xp rates. Skilling in itself has always been grindy and a lot of people chose to completely ignore them and just train combat. Based on that I think a good compromise might be to have a higher combat xp rate (applying to all skills that change your combat level) and a more average skilling xp rate.</p>
<p>I’m going to put up a little vote for people to get their initial thoughts in. Note that this are not indicative of the final result, there is still discussion to be had.</p>

Why don’t we redesign experience and item acquisition to alleviate the grinding? Or would that make it too different?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Agreed. Item levels should be restructured to fit a time table.[/quote]<br>
Well whatever the case there’s plenty of proof that MMORPGs still work even without hundreds of hours of grinding.<br>
Just look at games like Guild Wars 1 and 2.</p>
<p>I’m of the opinion that you should make experience acquisition contingent on completing quests (of sorts) and pro-rate the experience for each skill so that it takes a finite number of these quests.<br>
Make the quests short enough that people won’t bother botting them (and various enough that scripting for them would take too much effort). Make the time to max a skill somewhere between 10 and 20 hours. Maxing all skills will take at least 10 to 20 days of around-the-clock gameplay, but getting reasonable levels (70s?) would only take a few.</p>
<p>Use google captchas in between receiving new quests, and again prior to receiving the quest reward. Continue to allow grinding, but make it an order or two of magnitude slower than doing the quest-based path.</p>
<p>Problem solved.</p>

        <p>I voted on the low side. It looks like people are wanting high rates which I foresee will be given. I think a better solution is to ramp up higher level creatures/mobs/activities to give more xp. Itd be a shame just to prance through the low levels.</p>
<p>So, for example:</p>
<p>1.0x levels 1-5,<br>
1.5x levels 5-15,<br>
2.0x levels 15-30,<br>
2.5x levels 30-45,<br>
3.0x levels 45-60,<br>
3.5x levels 60-75,<br>
4.0x levels 75-99</p>
<p>It’d take 3/4 the time to get to 5-15, 1/2 the time to go from 15-30, 1/4 the time to go from 30-45, 1/6 the time to go from 45-60, etc</p>

<p>I’d love to see a system like this in place. An xp rate of 5x+ is a bit ridiculous to be honest. A system like this would still provide enough of a challenge while keeping those who like to speed through a skill happy enough.</p>
