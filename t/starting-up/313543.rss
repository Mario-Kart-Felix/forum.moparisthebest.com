    <description>Let&#39;s say I want to get started with an RSC server. I&#39;ve been working with RS2 servers and basic java applications for about 2years. Would it be a dramatic difference in the style of things. Are RSC servers packaged? Does RSC use MySQL? Just basic changes that would slow progress if I wanted to switch.</description>

              <p>If you wan’t a decent source without the hastle of setting up mysql and such then go with Easy-RSC. It basiclly the same as RS2 where the account are created through the client and saved in files instead of to a mysql database.</p>
<p>If your interested in mysql then go with rscdv25, the difference between rscd v25 and easy-rsc is that rscdv25 has a Loginserver where multiple worlds can be registered (ie: world 1, world2…), easy-rsc dosen’t support this. Second difference between rscd25 and easyrsc is that rscdv25 needs the user to register an in-game name through a forum and when reigsterd, it stors everything in a mysql database oppose to player files.</p>
<p>My sugg would be to go with easy-rsc for now and when your a bit more comfortable, go with rscd25.</p>

<p>What do you mean it’s mostly dead? Everytime I come on here people talk about how things need to be done in their servers and not a lot of things are released etc etc.[/quote]</p>
<p>With the leak of rscdv25 2 years ago, there hasnt been 2 days of development on these forums because many people cant do better.  Im guessing what you mean by people talk about how things need to be done in their servers is xml editing (mostly). The real development is done privately.</p>
<p>Yes there is a list of bugs/missing features here <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,394074.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,394074.0.html</a></p>
<p>It isnt much as it use to be</p>
