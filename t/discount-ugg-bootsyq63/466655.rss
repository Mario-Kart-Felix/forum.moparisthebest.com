New York (CNN) -- After his state&#39;s coastline took the brunt of Superstorm Sandy, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Friday that he expects power to be almost fully restored statewide by Saturday night.&quot;Life will be back -- for most of [url=http://www.cooluggboots.co.uk]www.cooluggboots.co.uk[/url] New Jersey -- to normal come Sunday,&quot; he told reporters.More than 175,000 households in the Garden State are still in the dark, and homes with saltwater electrical damage will have to be inspected by electricians before having their [url=http://www.ukdiscountuggboot.co.uk]ugg boots australia[/url] power restored.&quot;Some of those homes have already been disconnected,&quot; said Chris Eck, a spokesman Jersey [url=http://www.cooluggboots.co.uk]ugg boots sale  online[/url] Central [url=http://www.ukdiscountuggboot.co.uk]discount ugg boots uk[/url] Power &amp; Light, the state&#39;s second largest power provider. &quot;We can&#39;t energize  the circuit until we know the system is safe.&quot;Christie&#39;s comments came after a tour of the Jersey shore, where Superstorm Sandy ravaged homes and business.

&quot;Much of  the iconic boardwalk is buckled and much of the piers are out to sea,&quot; he said. &quot;The shore and boardwalk in Seaside Heights of my childhood no longer exists.&quot;&quot;This is our Katrina,&quot; the governor added.To the north, some 20,000 households across New York City and Westchester County remained without power. Another 150,000 homes in Long Island and harder-hit areas of Queens, such as Rockaway Peninsula, were also in the dark after the double blow of Sandy and this week&#39;s nor&#39;easter.But in an attempt to deal with persistently long gas lines, New York police started enforcing a new alternating fuel ration system on Friday. Drivers with license plates that end with a letter or an odd number could [url=http://www.ukdiscountuggboot.co.uk]www.ukdiscountuggboot.co.uk[/url] fill up Friday, while those with even numbers or zero can fill up Saturday.
