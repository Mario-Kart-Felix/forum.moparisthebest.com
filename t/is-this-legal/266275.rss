<p>Give it a try, the government wouldn’t do much because of a game.</p>

Looking further into that statement, how do you hack into a school with a program, how do you move Fs to As, why would you put a TOS on something unless you plan on releasing it (which basically makes it not for educational purposes…)?</p>
