    <title>Question on cookies</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-on-cookies/17182</link>
    <description>I was curious if there was anyway to get a cookie from a diffrent desination then the one that you are on. For example

If you visit www.thisserver.com , can www.thisserver.com request to view a cookie that was created before, or one that is currently being used from www.yourserver.com, If you get my drift

If you wish to know why. I go to myspace, and the past few days i have seen so many fake trackors. It is said to be able to know when people visit your page, and who visits them. And I wanted to see if there was was a way to create one from using cookies.</description>
