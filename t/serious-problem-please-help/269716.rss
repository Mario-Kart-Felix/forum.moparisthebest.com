    <description>I found skill masters and i downloaded models and in class8.java dfs but i saw that dfs uses model 6 but from cache folder  i think.. so one of the skill masters uses model 6 and i typed &quot; Add model 6&quot; and so when i spawn dfs  i get something like prayer cape cause model 6 is master of pray so is there a way to remove model 6? I renamed it and stuff but it&#39;s still the same i mean is there a way to remove it from client or something cause i added it :(
I found a dfs but it doesn&#39;t move while u fight.</description>
