<p>They are outdated graphics from 5 years ago. There’s a whole new generation of games out with superior graphics. That being said, graphics are not very important and don’t affect how fun the game is.</p>

fanboy much, dont be a short sighted idiot, you cant say it is the greatest game that was ever created without evidence. Its spelt ‘graphics’ by the way. As for lag yes it can for a lot of people either because of their lower end PCs or their connections but thats not the age necessarily. And just because something has more players doesnt mean its good</p>

I was like “wow, youre COOL.” I couldn’t even be assed.</p>

<p>And as for professional, that doesn’t mean they have to be a blizzard employee. Blizzard employees aren’t the only paid programmers that can, and probably aren’t the programmers that ever will, work on private server emulators; anybody with C++ knowledge can.</p>

</aside>
<p>you didnt get the metaphor did you? even after i explained it. Ok here goes nice and slow just for you.<br>
Step 1: You say they are professionals<br>
What this means: means they get paid implying they are from Blizzard, a company that make an MMO.<br>
Note: anyone that gets paid at what they do is a professional yes, but not all C++ programmers are professionals with servers are they?<br>
Step 2: I make the link between jagex, another company that make an MMO, and moparscape a private server emulating community.<br>
What this means: it implies your stupidity by thinking that blizzard employees take part in emulating their own game by suggesting that jagex employees also take part in emulating their own game.<br>
Summary: So now you see the point in the statement and what it means. That wasn’t difficult was it?<br>
[/quote]I’m not even going to try and point out your abundance of errors. But, oh well, both of your ‘steps’ try to point out the same thing; which is that I said Blizzard employees are the ones creating the WoW emulators. And, as I’ve pointed out before, I never said anything like that. You even agreed that a professional is anyone who gets paid, and I said that ON THE SERVER I WAS A GM ON (WoWscape) the devs were professionals. I know this. But they also don’t work for Blizzard.</p>
<p>Please shut up nao.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>you cant be a professional in server emulation you retard is your skull so thick that this single fact cant penetrate it. And each step is related as should any process that requires multiple steps but they arent the same steps otherwise i would’ve written the same thing. And seriously what is wrong with your fucking fingers to try and type ‘now’ and end up typing ‘nao’ did you have a random spasm while some bloke was sucking you off under the table? Did your muscles just lock up and you could only reach the a and o keys?<br>
[/quote]You CAN be a professional in server emulation if you do professional programming as a career. Thanks for your logic.[/quote]<br>
no that makes you a professional programmer</p>

<p>That’s funny, because i was a developer on ONE OF THE SMALLEST WOW PRIVATE SERVERS OUT THERE, and almost everything, even in TBC, functioned correctly. The “faggots” that worked on our server knew what the fuck they were doing, maybe yours should have tried it.</p>

<p>yeah they were professionals im sure, because i understand that jagex’s employees are members or moparscape<br>

<p>And as for professional, that doesn’t mean they have to be a blizzard employee. Blizzard employees aren’t the only paid programmers that can, and probably aren’t the programmers that ever will, work on private server emulators; anybody with C++ knowledge can.[/quote]<br>
you didnt get the metaphor did you? even after i explained it. Ok here goes nice and slow just for you.<br>
Step 1: You say they are professionals<br>
What this means: means they get paid implying they are from Blizzard, a company that make an MMO.<br>
Note: anyone that gets paid at what they do is a professional yes, but not all C++ programmers are professionals with servers are they?<br>
Step 2: I make the link between jagex, another company that make an MMO, and moparscape a private server emulating community.<br>
What this means: it implies your stupidity by thinking that blizzard employees take part in emulating their own game by suggesting that jagex employees also take part in emulating their own game.<br>
Summary: So now you see the point in the statement and what it means. That wasn’t difficult was it?</p>
