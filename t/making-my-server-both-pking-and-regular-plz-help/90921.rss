    <title>Making my server both pking and regular. plz help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-my-server-both-pking-and-regular-plz-help/90921</link>
    <description>hey guys i have a pking server and well i want to make varrock a pking server and al-karad a regular server.
I would take al-karad and make it non-wildy.
so I need alot of help from you coders out there. 
so what i was thinking was that i make fishing, mining/smithing, crafting, and runecrafting 
a skill to use on pimpscape source. 
right now smithing kinda works 
but i want elemental bars and gold bars to work. 

In crafting i think i know how to make a code that 
when you use a chisel with a uncut (gem) and then it 
deletes that uncut (gem) and then it adds a (gem) 
and then gives you like 1000 xp for crafting. 
Also i want to do that with d hide. 

I still need help with crafting. 

and i need alot of help with mining cause i have no clue how to do that.

 I also (also) want to get fishing and cooking. 

can anyone of you coders help? plz? you can msn messenger me or get on my server :confused: :confused: :confused:</description>

              <p>There are two things you could do.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the source again, make a copy, and change the port to ONE of them ( so maybe one would be 43594 for pking and 5555 for regular)</li>
<li>Make al kharid a safezone, and add some global objects</li>
</ol>
<p>let me get you the links for the adding global objects tutorial and safezone tutorial</p>
