<p>This implies that Jagex knows who the gold farmers are. If you have that kind of info, why not just ban them all?<br>
This also implies that Jagex knows how much gold has been traded. If they know where and how much gold is being sold, why not filed a suit against them and have those sites removed?</p>
<p>Sounds like a load of crap to me. Another failed attempt at creating a statistic or fact that Jagex has used to justify more microtransactions.</p>

I don’t have any reason to doubt them. As any business knows, you want to measure everything.<br>
Real-world trades would stand out like a sore thumb; there aren’t many players who would trade a random player and suddenly give them 100m in return for very little or nothing. Not without a catalyst (read: payment in the real world). It wouldn’t be hard to identify all of these trades, with a certain margin for error. Similarly, it would be easy to identify a lack of these trades.</p>

<p>What you just said is like basically telling me that if I am unhappy with my president, I just need to run for president. Which is just stupid, because I have neither the credentials for either.

Jagex have tried to get rid of the bots. It seems like you’re unsatisfied with their effort. If Optimus lagged the server and banned too many people, you can’t say that they haven’t used enough resources or haven’t been harsh enough.</p>
<p>Lets take your president analogy a step further. The people who oppose a politician/party often do have an alternative solution, you do not.</p>
<p>[quote=“4x4Chevrolet, post:43, topic:532542”]I think it’s a good idea personally, seeing as so many people buy gold anyways, this is kind of a safe way of doing it. I like how you can buy membership with gps now as well, this could even out the game some…</p>
<p>I only see one problem, won’t these sites just start selling bonds now? Cheaper than Jagex?[/quote]<br>
All new bonds need to be bought from Jagex. So this will be balanced in the end.</p>

Don’t overestimate the effort to develop those discrete features. In reality it’s probably the work of a micro team (think five people tops). The reason they can be so frequent is that, frankly, they’d be relatively trivial to implement when compared to something complex like a quest, skill, or new in-game region.</p>

<p>It has been P2W since Squeal tickets became purchasable. I mean you could literally buy OP binded items for irl cash. That plus lamps basically meant you were buying xp and gear. Then when Solomon came out it turned into Pay to Update, where you basically had to buy quality graphical updates just so the animations would look as natural as the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Overall RS is just garbage. I do not regret all of the money and time I put into it, because in the end I have extremely fond memories of both the game and the players. However, I am glad I quit on the day of EoC. Should they ever decide to revert back to pre-EoC and work on legit updates and make the game more about adventuring and having fun, not grinding and buying your way to the top, I may come back. I will not spend 8 USD to play a half-assed game with no future.</p>
