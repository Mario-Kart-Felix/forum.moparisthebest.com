    <title>Webclient 99.9% Working, 1 problem, 1 question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-99-9-working-1-problem-1-question/256433</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I recently followed I sora I&#39;s webclient TuT a few pages back, and I now have a working webclient. It loads on my computer very quickly, but when on the internet it stays on unpacking interfaces for 8 minutes+. Just wondering If thats to do with using a crap laptop with wireless modem in the middle of no where, or It is something with my client? I am stuck with a laptop for a long long time. If someone could test it for me? That&#39;d be great, But I assume I wont be allowed to post my site on here.

QUESTION:

I am also looking at adding a console (No GUI, JGMS Client Base)

To my client to check to see if it has problems on the net, etc.

Kindest Regards,

Liam</description>

<p>This is as far as Ive ever come with a webclient, So could someone provide me wth a “good” 317 client base that supports skillcapes and godswords.</p>

              <p>thats what happens when you make a client with custom interfaces and shit, thats why all good webclient use all sprites and iterfaces found on the rs cache.(ex. silabsoft, frugoo, moparscape, etc.)</p>
