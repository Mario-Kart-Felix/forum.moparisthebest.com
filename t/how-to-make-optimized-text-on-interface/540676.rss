    <title>How to make optimized text on interface !?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-optimized-text-on-interface/540676</link>
    <description>How would I go about making an optimized text on an interface in a RSPS??. I want it to be just like the &#39;report abuse panel in RS, I want it to have the same function properties as that, but my own &#39;text&#39; obviously. Could somebody please explain how this could be done most efficiently an proper way?

I made a control panel interface with a sidebar and its all good,
an I&#39;ve added a staff panel with a ban option and kick option and I want to be able to write my &#39;own&#39; text an hit a &#39;ban&#39; button, etc.
And it will ban the name that is written...

THANKS!</description>
