    <title>Apparently people can&#39;t connect to serv</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/apparently-people-cant-connect-to-serv/257582</link>
    <description>I had a friend try out my server last night only to find out that he couldn&#39;t get on.  I&#39;m going to assume its one of two errors, his internet not letting him do this kind of thing (not likely but still possible), or my port forwarding having gone wrong.

I know how to do PF&#39;ing fairly well, I had to do it for XBL and a number of other things over the years, but there is a strange error coming up when I follow the &quot;How to make a server&quot; tutorial, my Router won&#39;t let me use my Default Gateway as the IP to forward for my server.

So, can anyone try and shed some light on this, or even just be willing to try to connect to my server for me?

At the risk of this being advertising (edit this for me mods or people just tell me to take it out), here is my server info:
Darthyscape.no-ip.info
43594

I can log into it via Silab without entering anything in the server field, so...</description>
