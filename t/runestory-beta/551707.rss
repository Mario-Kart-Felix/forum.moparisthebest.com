Hi, a while ago we released out BETA like we are doing now, to get feedback and develop our project. Much of the feedback we got was worthwhile and many of those individuals like the server much more now. We&#39;ve invested resources into this project and we&#39;re hoping to give a enjoyable and balanced gameplay. All benifits donators get are now not unfair advantages, nobody can buy themselves a good account through our game i.e. donations. We are still providing them with benifits, just ones that will not effect other players directly. We&#39;ve improved much of the server, adding different bosses and new maps for exploration, a new quest system which we&#39;re hoping to develop further with over 10 quests. Right now what we want is further feedback, bugs to be revealed and eventually release properly. Right now the website is half-done so please ignore it as much as you can and concentrate on ingame.

I cannot be as active as my partner who will be on most of the day, he will aid you as much as he can. We advise that you dont try to vote or donate for us right now, as we are in a BETA stage, we aren&#39;t advertising to get players at the momment.

Thanks. Here is some media (again, right now we aren&#39;t concentrating on anything like good-looking media besides the game):
