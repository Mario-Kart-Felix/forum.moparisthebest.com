Xythax, the [b]REAL[/b] 317 F2P remake.

[hr][/center]

Xythax is a revolutionary 317 RuneScape Private Server. We&#39;re making this in attempt to revive the epic 317 era that we all loved and enjoyed, seeing as all I see on the server status page and such now is just servers that are there for the money. Xythax will be the server to make a change. We&#39;re using my base as the server and will have a team of developers working on it whenever they can. This will be the server to look out for in the future, I guarantee you.

[b]What are your plans?[/b]
We plan to make an almost exact 317 free to play remake of RuneScape. I realise everyone is a little fed up of seeing remakes everywhere, but this will be one to keep a look out for this will go far. Below are a list of our ideas, not our actual plans. It&#39;s too early in the development to actually list them as plans.


[code]
Create a full 317 remake.
Make it Free to Play to begin with.
When people donate, it&#39;s for membership, not for items.
When they donate, they will get a higher exp rate and possibly a higher drop rate.
They may also get a P2P world, after hosting for a while and getting a good playerbase.
[/code]

We are open to suggestions, a lot of suggestions, so post below what you guys think will be good for when we open this as a server. As for server content, we have that covered between our development team.

Our developers currently are;
[b]Ruby[/b] - Website Developer &amp; Founder.

[b]Rodgerwilco[/b] - Java Developer
[b]Eyeownyew[/b] - Java Developer
[b]xxxtilllyxxx[/b] - Java Developer
[b]KroniKz_[/b] - Java Developer
[b]Whackatre[/b] - Java Developer

[b]Loveandpower[/b] - BETA Tester

After this is fully developed and been run for a while, we plan on releasing JAG, the API which we are developing as the entire content of the server, but we will not be releasing the actual server, at least, this is the plan right now.

[hr]

Jag is the API for 317 servers. All content such as quests will be included in the API so that server frameworks can easily use it to their advantage. 

Xythax is a new RS2 emulator written almost entirely from scratch (see thanks msg) and the first server to use Jag. 

Features : 
-Netty 
-Multi-threaded
-Event driven
-Uses external Jag API which includes content. As you can see below.. the source is more of a skeleton and all content is a simple plugin.

Output from my spare comp.
[code]
[SYSTEM] Cores: 2
[SYSTEM] Netty Workers: 4
[SYSTEM] Server Threads: 4
[SYSTEM] Memory Allocated: 1748kb / 16252kb
[SYSTEM] Startup Time: 5519ms
[SYSTEM] Runescape is now Online!
Logged in.

Special thanks to...
Hyperion - Graham (Cipher)
Some rs2 server - leeched some documentation from you.
xEnt - Ripping little memory snippet from catalyst.

<p>Jc, I’ll have to make a correction. I do think eyeownyew is a well to do programmer, and that he can do this. Rodgerwilco, I’ve never heard anything of, although in above posts it seems he is trying entirely too hard to sound smart. Lets start with Tilly, while I think he is a decent programmer, he is always getting help from other programmers, such as blakeman. He could complete it, but not on his own. KroniKz_, I have never seen anything from, never seen him help anyone, never seen anything from him. He just kinda showed up out of no where, I just love how he decided to take a swing at me by posting a really immature comeback on my development thread, which just made him seem like a retard in the end. Whackatre, I see him on the forums all the time, never have seen him complete anything. Don’t plan on seeing him complete anything. Now aside from Java development, Ruby Forums Coder, every time I ask someone who you are the answer is always, “scammer”, but, I can’t always base my opinions off of others, so I’m not going to say anything more about you, seeing as I don’t know you.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Asking for help from another programmer who has more knowledge in the field isn’t a bad thing, if they were just spoon feeding that it’s different, but asking for help and get some points to go in the right direction is never a bad thing…[/quote]<br>
It’s not that he asks for help that we’re saying it’s a bad thing, but being spoonfed completely on the question and still not understanding at all what is going on.</p>
<p>As some of you requested, we (we as in the people attacking, I can try to proudly speak on behalf of them) will stand down for a little while and watch you guys.  If this turns out to be unsuccessful or in any way any member that we predicted to be unworthy does not complete their task, then we will not rage but just post one thing: “Told you so.”</p>
<p>This whole API stuff is still not making any real sense to me, if you could explain it into more deph, RodgerWilco, that’d be great.</p>

why would there be a core in this API if it’s strictly content?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Great question. I am utilizing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">separation of concerns</a> and a (with a twist) DDD (Domain driven model). Not only for that reasoning but for a future release. All content can be added by the community and hopefully all content for a f2p - 317 replica will be gathered. This will allow future 317 servers/frameworks to easily have access to a full replica as a simple plugin. In my picture above you can see my skeleton so that my main focus is the Xythax framework, simple for me as all I worry about is performance.[/quote]separation of concerns is implicit in all code, perhaps you could be much more specific about what you’re doing to separate concerns since it’s an umbrella term over everything from methods to dependency injection (and it sounds like something you’re throwing around to appear smart, tyb noticed this too). also performance isn’t everything, the fact that you jumped from generalised design to then saying that performance is a big concern is antithetical and hilarious.</p>

<p>Jc, I’ll have to make a correction. I do think eyeownyew is a well to do programmer, and that he can do this. Rodgerwilco, I’ve never heard anything of, although in above posts it seems he is trying entirely too hard to sound smart. Lets start with Tilly, while I think he is a decent programmer, he is always getting help from other programmers, such as blakeman. He could complete it, but not on his own. KroniKz_, I have never seen anything from, never seen him help anyone, never seen anything from him. He just kinda showed up out of no where, I just love how he decided to take a swing at me by posting a really immature comeback on my development thread, which just made him seem like a retard in the end. Whackatre, I see him on the forums all the time, never have seen him complete anything. Don’t plan on seeing him complete anything. Now aside from Java development, Ruby Forums Coder, every time I ask someone who you are the answer is always, “scammer”, but, I can’t always base my opinions off of others, so I’m not going to say anything more about you, seeing as I don’t know you.[/quote]</p>
<p>Asking for help from another programmer who has more knowledge in the field isn’t a bad thing, if they were just spoon feeding that it’s different, but asking for help and get some points to go in the right direction is never a bad thing…</p>

<p>Hey guys, stop pulling crap out of your asses, thanks.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@tyb</span>: Why aren’t any of them capable of completing this ‘feat’? Show me some of their <span class="bbcode-b">programming</span> flaws to validate your own point. Stop pulling crap out of your ass.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@imsuperman</span>: Really? How so? I don’t believe any of their IQs are under 70. You really cannot call them retards if you have no sufficient evidence of them being unable to program at all. Stop pulling crap out of your ass.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@asshole</span>: Similar to imsuperman, show me some proof of their ‘retardation’ or stop pulling crap out of your ass.</p>

<p>What does this thread have to do with respect? It’s a development thread, and if development occurs, the thread has served its purpose.</p>
<p>PS: <span class="mention">@tyb</span>: You don’t see this going far because you don’t respect anyone on this thread other than Loveandpower? I’m pretty sure the success of an emulation depends mostly on ability to program, and I’m also quite positive the majority, if not all of the current developers are more experienced in programming than Loveandpower (no offence to you). So please, explain to me again why you don’t see this development going far if you’re basing the level of success on “respect.” <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
