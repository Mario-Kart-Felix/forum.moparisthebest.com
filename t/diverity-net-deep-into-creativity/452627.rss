- New vBulletin forum !
- Experienced developers that actually know how to play RS, code, and make the best updates for players
- Aura system is implemented: for example, the Greed Aura, which has a chance to double drops for an hour, and the Aura of Life, which saves all your items if you die outside the wild.
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FsMWK.png[/img]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/szluj.png[/img]

- Unique &quot;Influence Point (IP)&quot; system: earn points by killing monsters, completing slayer tasks, killing players in the Wilderness and in FunPK, and even doing things like skilling and participating in mini-games such as Barrows and Pyramid Run!
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/6Qx3F.png[/img]
Rings of Wealth (tiers 1, 2, and 3)
Imbued Rings
Balmung (+120 strength bonus, like a mini-godsword without a spec)
Ranged items
Godwars Master Key (grants full GWD Killcount, great for a fast trip or to run back and pick up your stuff when you die)
Bonecrusher: automatically buries bones from monster drops (donators can get this for coins instead of IP) - untradable
Charm Magnet: automatically picks up charms from monster drops - untradable
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/9356D.png[/img]

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/zONiH.png[/img]
Chaotics, torso, Korasi&#39;s Sword (works EXACTLY like in rs - 50% minimum hit and hits with magic), Staff of Light (also 100% working - halves melee damage from NPCs and players for 1 minute)

- No &quot;Donor Prods&quot; - donators can&#39;t donate for IP items, IP, boss drops, or basically whatever they want. They still reap their own benefits, but these do not devalue the work that ordinary players do.
- Custom titles for Donators!
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/TKimr.png[/img]
- Max hit dummies (err... spiders) at Donor Isle!
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/T2VSS.png[/img]
- Sled for 2k donator points
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/q6rB8.png[/img]
- Ringmaster kit for 2.5k donator points - allows you to backflip by operating any piece of the set
[IMG]http://www.picstation.net/pictures/221ecf61cef8d95a0b6d67bd860dc510.gif[/img]

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/KQB9r.png[/img]
Non-degradable PvP armors. Speak about OP!

You can reach the store here:
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/YrBVP.png[/img]

- Custom F2P PK area - only F2P items and food allowed! (mystic is considered F2P, along with wave spells, because F2P mage in RS sucks)
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/I1LnE.png[/img]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/MSdNH.png[/img]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nU2aG.png[/img]
Every kill you make in the F2P PK Zone will net you IP as if you were PKing in the real wilderness. Remember that all anti PK-farm measures are still in place. Additionally, you gain 10 F2P Zone PKP every kill you make. On top of that, you receive a bonus 2 F2P PKP per kill that your opponent has made without dying (their kill streak). For example, if you kill someone who is on a kill streak of 6, you gain 10+6*2=22 F2P Zone PKP.

F2P Zone PKP can be spent on a multitude of neat items. Most of them are cosmetic, but some provide benefits to enhance your F2P PKing.
Gravite Rapier (500 points): +56 stab bonus, +56 strength bonus
Gravite Longsword (500 points): +65 slash bonus, +65 strength bonus
Gravite 2h Sword (750 points): +87 crush and slash bonus, +90 strength bonus
Gravite Staff (350 points): +15 magic bonus, +10% magic damage (passive: +25% damage on wave spells, for a total of +35% damage)
Rune Gauntlets (50 points): +10/11 defense bonus, +2 strength bonus
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/bgboL.png[/img]

- &quot;Storm of Armadyl&quot; spell added (takes the slot of Iban&#39;s Blast), and it casts faster with the &quot;Armadyl Battlestaff&quot;, or the Empowered Air Staff. It has a minimum hit, like real rs, and increased accuracy.
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/MWmEt.png[/img]

- A myriad of formidable bosses to fight, such as:
- The Night-Gazer, which has 2 forms, 25% lifesteal and smite, and drops Celestial Robes and new rings that were never released by Runescape
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/OJkHa.png[/img]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/yT2vm.png[/img]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Lr0im.png[/img]

- Redone Chaos Elemental, which drops PvP Artifacts, Arcane Necklaces, and the dragon 2h sword
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/CNa1C.png[/img]

- Rammernaut, which resides at the end of a large chain dungeon and drops Primal Maul and Warhammer
- Nomad, which is completely recoded from scratch: it doesn&#39;t just kind of hit you, like on other rsps, but it has MANY different attacks, such as an unavoidable &#39;soul blast&#39; attack that he must charge up for, and many phases, where on the final phase, he hastes his attack speed significantly. He also comes with a complicated quest, unique to Diverity, securing Nomad as an elite boss only to be accessed by elite players.
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/jCqMh.png[/img]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/57sOo.png[/img]
Here&#39;s a small teaser from the quest &quot;Nomad&#39;s Return&quot;...
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/c4jfs.png[/img]

- The Penance Queen, which is a challenging boss that requires you to obtain 1000 Ghost Charges to enter - while each ghost kill grants 50 or 120 charges depending on the ghost, the charges deplete over time, making this boss only one that may be killed, or even reached, by those prove to be the most powerful players - and some of these players might walk away with the fabled Pernix armor.
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/pkCtl.png[/img]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Kw1WC.png[/img]

- Bork, who resides at his own little camp in the Wilderness, and drops PvP artifacts as well as the Hand-Cannon
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Q5g9N.png[/img]

- Astea Frostweb, who is in a dungeon in very weep wilderness. She can only be hurt by ranged (mage will always splash), and drops third-age mage robes and farseer kiteshield!
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nIsxS.png[/img]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/eYFrX.png[/img]
-3 bosses in a custom chain dungeon - the Revenant Dragon, Slash Bash, and the Plane-Freezer![IMG]http://i.imgur.com/tracm.png[/img]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/OhH1Q.png[/img]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/5CVLF.png[/img]

-Completely recoded EP (earning potential) system - earn EP by doing activity in the wilderness, such as killing mages at the Mage Arena or killing Frost Dragons (even killing players grants EP), and use EP by icing another player&#39;s killing spree! WIth enough EP and luck, you may find yourself as the new owner of a Primal Longsword.
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Zyb3e.png[/img]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/DEM6I.png[/img]

- New minigames constantly added, such as: Pyramid Run, where you test your tankiness as you run through a pyramid, tanking hoards of ruthless mummies and scarab swarms, in order to make it to the treasure rooms that contain Agile Armor and the Pharoah&#39;s Sceptre, while gaining mass agility experience.
- Quick prayers and curses
- Godwars, with donators being able to &quot;boost&quot; their KC to 1/3 (15 is needed in total), and all players being able to use the Godwars Master Key, which instantly grants full KC, but costs quite a sum of Influence Points.
- All bosses have generously written and diverse drop tables, unlike some private servers, which are like: &quot;1% rare drop, 99% junk&quot;
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7YRSQ.png[/img]

- Extreme potions work 100%, including Recover Special and Overloads. When I say 100%, I MEAN 100%. Mix an avantoe with a Super Attack to get an Extreme Attack. Grind down a mud rune and put it in a Magic Potion for an Extreme Magic. Put all Extreme Potions (Attack, Strength, Defense, Magic, Ranged) with a Torstol, and get an Overload. Overloads last for 5 minutes, and repeat the boost every 15 seconds. They don&#39;t max the boost, like some flawed private servers, but repeat it - one will have to find the balance between how many times to brew and restore, like in real RS.
[IMG]http://www.picstation.net/pictures/ed16ee577e3bdac1f9513e58b020e8df.gif[/img]

- Divine, Elysian, and Chaotic Shields all have been completely re-coded. Divine and Elysian work AS THEY SHOULD, absorbing damage in PvP and PvM, and the Chaotic Shields (Chaotic, Eagle-Eye, and Farseer), absorb 10% of their equal combat style and 20% of their &quot;strong-against&quot; combat style, like how Runescape originally wanted to make it before they introduced their silly armor soaking update. For example, Eagle-Eye kiteshield (ranged) soaks 10% range and 20% mage.
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/WlAP2.png[/img]

- Balanced combat system: AGS doesn&#39;t always spec 50+, magic damage works (boosted level + equipment), onyx bolts are buffed because they obviously suck, etc
- Killing spree announcements: once you hit a killing streak of 3 or higher, it will be announced globally! Also, bonus IP are rewarded upon icing another player&#39;s killing streak.


- Drop announcements: upon obtaining a super-rare drop such as a Divine Sigil, Torva Platebody, or maybe just a Frostbite Dagger, it will be announced globally for your peers to shed their jealous eyes on!
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/UX6Bb.png[/img]
- Frost Dragons for donators (via portal) and non-donators (at ice plateau) - they drop Frost Dragon Bones (obviously, right? lol), which are more than 3x better than Dragon Bones, and they also drop good handfuls of resources. Those in the Wilderness, however, are quite rewarding, so even donators might be pulled to travel there in hunt for PvP artifacts and the rare Frostbite Dagger, which is a buffed Dragon Dagger. The drop rate for the Frostbite Dagger for Donator-only Frost Dragons almost half as high as those in the Wilderness.
- 100% recoded Ring of Wealth, with three tiers; your ordinary Ring of Wealth is available for 100 IP, and boosts drop rates by 5%; Superior Ring of Wealth, for 500 IP (10%); Auspicious Ring, for 1800 IP (20%). For example, if a drop rate is 1/100 (1%), it won&#39;t become 21% with an Auspicious Ring (because that would obviously be &quot;OP&quot;), but rather 1.2/100 or 1.2% - but basically, the deal is, when one person obtains 5 Bandos Chestplates, the person with the Auspicious Ring obtains 6. ; )
- Soul Split heals in PvP and PvM by the proper 20% of damage dealt
- Korasi&#39;s Sword actually WORKS, unlike 98% of private servers. By this, I mean that it deals magic damage, is immensely accurate, and best of all, IT HAS A MINIMUM HIT EQUAL TO HALF ITS MAX HIT, like real RS. TIME TO ANTIRUSH!
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/3Tu9J.png[/img]

- Staff of Light completely RECODED. Unlike many other RSPS, it doesn&#39;t halve ALL damage, but rather only melee damage. It also has its GFX 100% uploaded; this even includes the &quot;light-bubble&quot; GFX that appears on you every time you get hit while the special effect is active.
[IMG]http://i49.tinypic.com/1tmu0h.png[/img]

-Slayer Helmets work 100%! They boost damage against your slayer task monsters - 16.66%, to be exact. The full slayer helm works for all combat styles and gives amazing bonuses (+10 mage def, OP hybrid helm!), and the normal one only works for melee.

- Enhanced Excalibur added as a future reward from quests/minigames: like in RS (after Seer&#39;s village elite tasks), the special attack heals you 40 health and boosts your defence. Great for sustain, whether it may be in Armadyl GWD or even minigames such as Pyramid Run!
- Elite slayer tasks added: you may be assigned to kill boss monsters, such as Bork, Godwars Generals, or the KBD, and these tasks grant 40 IP each!
- Expanded &quot;hard&quot; slayer task roster: tired of Blue Dragons, Hellhounds, and Black Demons all day long? How about Crabs (located in Barrelchest dungeon) or Frost Dragons??
- Redone Corporeal Beast: it doesn&#39;t use range, and takes half damage from non-spear attacks!
- Reworked Zamorak Godwars: you want that Zammy spear for corp? Well, you have to take on this buff, recoded boss first - he even says &quot;YARRRR!&quot; and hits through your prayer, like in real RS!
- Hybrid Kits and Melee Welfare Kits, containing all items essential for welfare PKing (at the cost of your GEEPEES of course), for those too lazy to buy all their gear seperately!
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/2IksU.gif[/img]

- Balanced systems: rather than doing ::resettask infinitely until you get a good task, it costs 30 IP. Sounds a bit harsh, right? No, you&#39;re too used to those messed-up, easy RSPS where you get all chaotics in a day, donate for full Torva, and get banned for flaming. But none of that occurs here!
- No &quot;Donor Prods&quot; - donators can&#39;t donate for IP items, IP, boss drops, or basically whatever they want. They still reap their own benefits, but these do not devalue the work that ordinary players do.

<p>“Wealth” - Add and calculate Item/Equipment value. The richest/poorest Players in-game.</p>
<p>“Most Newbie Player” - The Player in-game with the lowest ‘Wealth’ &amp; ‘Total Level’. This will inspire Players to not create useless Accounts or Mules and such.</p>

The fact that it only has a few players really saddens me, because it deserves to have the most players out of all servers out there. There are so many unique features that make this server different from every other server out there, and that’s what RSPS community is all about, ORIGINALITY.</p>

              <p>This server is amazing. The fact that it only has a few players really saddens me, because it deserves to have the most players out of all servers out there. There are so many unique features that make this server different from every other server out there, and that’s what RSPS community is all about, ORIGINALITY.</p>
