    <description>I have tried so many things to get my server on the status page! It always says it is offline. I have done everything the tutorials say!

Here are the specs:

Server: Allstar-scape V2.
Java: jdk1.6.0_07, jre1.6.0_07, jre1.6.0_01.
Name: shelshockscape.no-ip.info .
IP: I used the one NO-IP gave me.
Firewall: Allowed shelshockscape.no-ip.info. Port - 43594. Protocol - TCP
Router: Linksys:
                    Application: Moparscape. Start - 43594 to End - 43594. Protocol - TCP IP address - 192.168.1.1
Additional information: I opened the Runserver thing. Then tried to register it... Nothing. I also Have the NO-IP DUC downloaded and the guy is blushing with my Server name on there. 


What do I do!?</description>
