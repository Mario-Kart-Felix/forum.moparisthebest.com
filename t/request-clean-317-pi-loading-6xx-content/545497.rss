    <title>[REQUEST] CLEAN 317 PI Loading 6xx content</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/request-clean-317-pi-loading-6xx-content/545497</link>
    <description>I&#39;m in need of a cleaned 317 PI server loading 6xx content. By clean I mostly mean not multiple duplicates of commands in the Commands class, although I could fix if I wanted to.

The source also has to have [b]no[/b] artificially placed NPCs (Shops in edge, or anywhere else). Basically just a Blank 317 PI loading 6xx source with all the critical elements coded already.

Client, Server, and Cache.

Thanks. :)</description>

Explain how hard it would be to clear the NPC spawns? Oh wait, all you have to do is go into the spawn file and delete everything.<br>
Really. You’re asking for someone to find a server and do like 3 minutes of work to it (apart from what was done by the previous owners etc).<br>
Why not just do it yourself? Because your definition of a clean PI is no where near mine.<br>
When I say clean, I mean no buttons working, no dialogues, no actions, no skills, etc.<br>

Dude just find the guy a clean PI, he doesn’t need your definition of clean  :palm:<br>

He doesn’t want a clean PI though. He wants a PI with a bunch of content. <span class="bbcode-b">but</span> with no npcs and no duplicate commands.<br>
That is, by definition, not clean.</p>
