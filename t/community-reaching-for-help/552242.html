        <p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>I used to run many servers that maybe got about 50-70 players and I really miss it…and I’ve seen how beaten up some servers have gotten and I miss just hanging out with a community, and I’d like to run a server…but I don’t know where to start. I don’t see many people interested in RSPSs anymore and I can understand why, but I’d like to get back into it. So I am reaching out to everyone to see if we can get together and just get a player base and some decent staff members to kick up a server.</p>
<p>I also want to say something. This server, I don’t want it to run off donations, but run off my love for the community. So any price for servers I will provide out of my OWN pockets. I have been saving up for quite a while just to make this announcement, and I guess it could go bad an we get nobody to join or it could go good and we have tons of people to join. So basically: this server won’t be begging you for money <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> which I know a lot of you like that. We may bring up donations in the future but I won’t allow the ability to make this a PAY to PLAY game. I don’t like that.</p>
<p>So please…if you are interested just post on here, and let me know I’ll check back daily and once I feel like we have enough support I will get the server rolling. I have not worked on much development yet, but I do have a base, and I want to save the trouble of asking you guys - What kind of features/server would you guys like?</p>
<p>One last thing: I want this server to be a community, not a staff-tyrant-game. I know we’ll need staff but I wanna look for the best who will do their job. So if you do wish to be staff I recommend just being apart of the discussion until the server is up and I’ll message you when you join.</p>
<p>It’d mean a lot to me if we could get some positive feedback, and I’d be happy to see if we can get a lot of support. This game will be entirely community run, all ideas will be through you. If we do get this server running, I vow to not go to sleep until I read every idea you guys have and respond to them <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Thank you all ~ XA (Matt)</p>

        <p>Where to start? Well, you’re on the designated sites for that, friend! You can easily make advertisements hereon Mopar, R-S, and RL. Once you’ve gotten that done, simply apply to some toplists and get your server noticed publicly throughout every available eyes possible.</p>
<p>It’s great to see someone starting a project based off passion as opposed to currency. It seems as though others would prefer that, of course - easily understandable. However, the majority of ‘server owners’ are only there to receive payments. Honestly, most of ‘server owners’ aren’t even attempting to learn legitimate functionality of the given language. It’s sad to see, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>Good luck with your server, Matt.</p>

<p>That is incorrect. I’m sure people at Ikov are making a substantial amount that they can pay the bills. Unless lare was an employee at Ikov I seriously doubt he would be making any sort of money around that ballpark. The way he said “part time” would make me believe that he was providing for himself. I know many people who are 17 that who are now living by themselves (or with room mates). So for him to state that he was making more money from a part time job, it isn’t surprising for me to believe that they are using this money to pay the bills.</p>

<p>Idk what you’re trying to prove to me. I said “I seriously doubt anyone is trying to pay bills/feed their family with income generated from rsps”. Obviously people at ikov make a boat load, but there’s only a few servers that actually make that amount of money. I never said it was <span class="bbcode-b">impossible</span> to support your fam with that money. Anyone who relies on something illegal(such as an rsps) as a way of income for their family is a retard.</p>
<p>I’m not even sure what you’re arguing tbh. Everything you’ve said is flawed, because once again, you’re the one who brought up paying bills, lol.</p>

<p>I’m not arguing over anything. I am just backing up my original statement that it isn’t so uncommon to see a 17 year old living by themselves paying their bills etc. Nothing i’ve said is flawed.</p>

[/quote]out of interest, is that before or after tax? at least in the UK it can seem like stuff like rsps can bring in a huge amount of money compared to a real job, then you realise you should technically be paying some ridiculous level of tax on that.[/quote]i doubt he pays tax he works for a rsps…</p>

<p>okay “my-swagger” im 17 years old, while other scrubs my age are working at fast food restaurants I’m “working” 2-4 days and making around $300-600 USD per week (depending on how much work I feel like doing, some server managers will also give big “payouts” every once in awhile). you look really dumb because no one was talking about CVs or references, all I was trying to state in my original comment was that I make more money with RSPS than I did when I had a part-time job… that’s all. pretty sure you’re just salty because you’re broke</p>

<p>To be fair they pay so much because they have part/full time jobs to be able to afford payouts like that.<br>
If they didn’t they would be able to code for themselves.</p>

He doesn’t deserve any level of credit - he should be thoroughly ashamed of himself.</p>
