    <title>Need Help With Orphaned Case (Beginner Coder)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-orphaned-case-beginner-coder/447622</link>
    <description>I&#39;m very new with java, and have been trying to learn it for a few days now. I&#39;m still very motivated.

I decided to try with an Anti-Leech but can&#39;t figure this one out. I&#39;m using Rune-World. (Link: http://bit.ly/Mz1wUY )
The creator posted some hints:
[code]Anti-Leech Help:
1. Missing bracket in ActionHandler.java that fucks up the code and provides most of the errors (hint: use Notepad++)
2. Theres a missing transient in Server.java, the missing transient is for a popular minigame involving 4 portals..
3. Last one. Zombies.java/ZombieWaves.java (Forget which one it is) is packaged incorrectly. The class is located in the minigames folder but packaged in the skills folder.[/code]

I can&#39;t find whats wrong in Action Handler. :(

May i have some assistance please? :)</description>

              <p>Learning to program with RuneScape private servers may not always be the best things, they can teach you how to program properly, but very rarely do they (unless you use something like Hyperion, etc). They teach a lot of bad habits and poor conventions, which is why I suggest maybe starting outside of the RSPS scene. Maybe something like a 2D game, etc. Mopar has a game development board you can use as well, so I would take advantage of that.</p>
<p>An orphaned case means there is a case laying outside of a switch block. Or you have a brackets mismatch and have a bracket inside of a case statement.</p>
<p>This is a classic case of an orphaned case</p>
<p>[code]<br>
public void myEx(int i) {<br>
switch (i) {<br>
case 1:<br>
System.out.println(“ex”);<br>
break;</p>
<pre><code>    default:
        System.out.println("ex");
        break;
    }
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Error lies here");
}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see there is a case after the closing bracket which is causing the error. A simple fix would be to simply move the case inside of the brace i.e;</p>
<p>[code]<br>
public void myEx(int i) {<br>
switch (i) {<br>
case 1:<br>
System.out.println(“ex”);<br>
break;</p>
<pre><code>    case 2:
        System.out.println("I now work");
        
    default:
        System.out.println("ex");
        break;
    }
}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>Edit:<br>
Yeah, exactly what I thought. When I looked in your ActionHandler class there was an } else { statement with a missing bracket, I don’t know if you can even consider that to be an leech.<br>

<p>As it says there’s a bracket missing. Compile the server and find the top case number, search for that in actionhandler.java and add the {/}</p>
