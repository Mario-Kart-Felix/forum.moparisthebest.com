    <description>Hi, I have not made a private server for quite a bit of time now. Learning PHP and mysql kinda got boring now I have quite a bit of knowladge on them.

But, I am going to develop a new private server, it is not going to be much.
Basically it&#39;ll be a blank source.


[b]Server[/b]
[i]The development has not started, I need to sort out my personal life out first, quite a few things have happend.[/i]

The server will include.

-All skills should be working 70 - 90% I will hold Tests to see if the server is stable, and skills are working without many glitches (Expect to see some glitches)

-Mini games will be created, there will not be a teleporting interface to get there, you will have to get there by walking. (Don&#39;t expect much mini-games, they will all work 100% so it&#39;ll take a bit to do that)

-Perfect IP ban

-Good fighting timers, don&#39;t see much servers that are pin point.

-All dragon specials, barrow specials will also be done if I have enough time.

-More suggestions please.


Nothing much, just to fix up a little bit of servers.</description>

I should start within 3 - 7 days, But cannot promiss to have much added, I may be changing a few things around and go with a blank source I have with no player render and stuff.</p>
<p>Basically the source will have.</p>
<p>Log-in<br>
Log-out</p>
