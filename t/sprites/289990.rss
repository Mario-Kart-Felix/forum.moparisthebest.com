    <description>Hey, this is not very important, but I was thinking of trying it when I found out how. So, how do I find the &#39;Hitsplash&#39; sprite? 

I have looked in all my files on my client, but can&#39;t seem to find anything. 

Is it like editing tiles, where you need a program to edit them? 

Thanks for any suggestions.

<p>Ok, this is very easy if you’re using Tom’s Cache Editor. Open up Tom’s C.E, Load your client’s cache. Now, go to “Edit Raw Jagex Images” or something like that, select “media.dat”, and go to “hitmarks” then choose the hitmark you want to change, and before you import it, make sure your background of the new hitmark is pink, or it will be your image with a white square around it. After you’re done with that, simple hit “save archive”</p>
