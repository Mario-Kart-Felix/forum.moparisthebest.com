    <title>[508] Starting 508 server problem [508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-starting-508-server-problem-508/305149</link>
    <description>I am having severe problems running a 508 server. I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RAN A 317 SERVER!! IT WORKS 100%!! ANYBODY CAN CONNECT!!

I was wondering if there are different port forwarding methods between 317 servers and 508 servers. I have done this:

-Downloaded loads of different sources / clients
-Signed up for NO-IP, created a Host, Downloaded NO-IP Duc
-Changed Environmental Veriables
-Set up a static IP

And yet, every time I try to connect to my server, the client says &quot;Unexpected error has occured. Please try using a different game world.&quot;
On the CMD for Runserver.bat, I can see &quot;Connection received&quot; from my IP each time I click. And, nobody INCLUDING me can connect, so it must be another problem than portforwarding.
Can someone please give me some help? I am getting quite angry &gt;.&gt;
I have not downloaded a cache because each time I try the link has been deleted. Is this necessary to load my server?
Also, in a lof of my clients, it simply wont load (stays on &quot;Connecting to update server&quot; and in the cmd says &quot;error_game_js5connect&quot;
Thanks guys</description>

              <p>to connect yourself to your own server enter it blank or enter</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">127.0.0.1</code></pre>
<p>for the js5 connect thing try and delete what you portforwarded and do it again it has<br>
happend to me many times before that should work.</p>
