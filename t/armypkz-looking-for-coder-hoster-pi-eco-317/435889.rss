    <description>Hello guy&#39;s it&#39;s Cody here and I decided to make a PI Server so apply now or miss all the fun!

I&#39;ve been wanting to make a server for year&#39;s and now here i am doing it and i need some help!

What I am for in this server is perfect combat, to make all of our player&#39;s happy and to have a all around awesome server

Once we get donation&#39;s It will all go to the server and it&#39;s improvement no matter what, I need a very good hoster who can guarantee a 24/7 stability satisfaction!   

Here is the layout i prefer you use to apply!
In-Game Name/Server Forums Name?:
How old are you?:
MSN:
What position do you want? (Coder,Hoster):
How long have you coded (ignore if not chosen Coder)?:
What time zone are you in?:
How long will you be on everyday?:
Why do you want to become part of this server?:

Coder&#39;s get admin

I Also need a GFX Designer!

Coder&#39;s 0/2


Ok Thank&#39;s Guy&#39;s!</description>
