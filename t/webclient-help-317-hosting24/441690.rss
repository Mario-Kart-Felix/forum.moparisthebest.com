    <description>i made a rsps and i already have it .jar&#39;d correctly (i think) and it runs on my browser but when other people try to run it, it says error and doesnt load anything but works perfectly for me, i think i have to change where the cache downloads but i don&#39;t have a clue where to change it. I know its a basic question but this is the first time i made a webhost webclient.</description>
