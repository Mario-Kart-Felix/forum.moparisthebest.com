              <p>to be honest, everyone starts out like you, when i first started it took me 5 mins to find client.java, now look at me, im quite good, not as good as other people, but im getting there! Trust me, you feel SO much better if you make it your self, just look for simple tuts like changing starting location etc… Then when you get the basics, move on to the more complicated stuff. Trust me, it’s not going to come over night, ive been doing for for about a year, and i think, ive come on a hell of a lot!!</p>
