              <p>Yes, but PVP isn’t that simple, if you’re getting shot at you don’t just stand still so how do you know in such situations. There is just too much to account for, and in most cases the report will boil down to no proof and just one persons word against another.</p>
<p>It’s a waste of time, as I said in my post if that’s happening just walk away they’ll either let you or come out of the residence to pursue you. All this rule will generate is a huge argument which will have no solution.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Tom_BETA, post:7, topic:442590”]This will be hard to enforce in most cases I recall when myself and Tarkoff were fighting in W1, to me it looked like he was in a residence as there was one behind him, but to him it looked like I was in a residence as there was also one behind me. (not when we started setting each other on fire :p)</p>
<p>I’m sure neither of us intentionally stood in said residence but when you’re fighting the last thing you think about is if you’re running into someones oddly placed residence. There is no clear way to determind these things most the time just your perception of where you think the residence is positioned in relation to where your opponent is stood, unless of course they’re stood behind a wall shooting you in a res.</p>
<p>I think this needs more of a code fix above a new rule, I hate adding rule specifics as it just makes the entire report process more complex which is something we’re trying not to do. If someones stood on a high tower with a bow in a residence then it’s a pretty simple solution: walk away.[/quote]</p>
<p>well i feel if you see your getting shot at and are not getting hurt you should just simply move out of the res in order to retaliate</p>
