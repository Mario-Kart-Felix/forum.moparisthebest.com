    <description>Title says it all,

I am running a 474 i have been through client.java and changed server ip from 127.0.0.1 to my server ip i have been in my signlink file and changed the code to work properly i have added 43594 to my exception rule in my firewall on my router and also in my firewall on windows i have been able to successfully host my 317 server i portforward via uttorent sorry if this is not enough detail i am quite braindead i&#39;ve been working on the 317 source for the past 2 days straight and its 2 am where i live.

can anyone out there help me at all or i have been looking into webclients would this solve any of these problems im coming across i would of thought it would still mean people would get stuck on update server but please let me know

Regards Junes

P.S NOTE!!!! this is NOT a 317 server so do not say go into server.java, egui.java, gui.java do not say i need to portfoward unless 474 uses a different port.... as people have no trouble logging into the 317 (this is for the people who do not read properly so please dont flame)</description>

<p>can anyone out there help me at all or i have been looking into webclients would this solve any of these problems im coming across i would of thought it would still mean people would get stuck on update server but please let me know</p>
<p>Regards Junes</p>
<p>P.S NOTE!!! this is NOT a 317 server so do not say go into server.java, egui.java, gui.java do not say i need to portfoward unless 474 uses a different port… as people have no trouble logging into the 317 (this is for the people who do not read properly so please dont flame)</p>
