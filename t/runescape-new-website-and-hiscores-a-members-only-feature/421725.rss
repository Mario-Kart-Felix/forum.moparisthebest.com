    <title>RuneScape New website and Hiscores, &#39;a members-only feature&#39;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-new-website-and-hiscores-a-members-only-feature/421725</link>
    <description>Well as many of you know, Jagex is making the new website, http://services.runescape.com/m=news/coming-next-week-new-website

As I read the &#39;in other news&#39;, I noticed that the hiscores which is available for everyone, is now only going to be a members only feature.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Other News...

- Along with the release of the new website, we will be making hi-scores a members-only feature.

This is for a number of reasons, but the main one is to keep them fresh. We want the hiscores to feature players who will compete with each other, tooth and nail, for hiscore glory. There are many dormant accounts within the hiscores that have not played for a very long time, and this will give new arrivals in Gielinor a shot at hiscore fame alongside the grizzled veterans on equal terms for all.

We want the hiscores to reflect the full range of content that RuneScape has to offer, and hope that they will be a big draw to the full, members’ game for those interested in high-level RuneScape competition on a level playing field.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Does anyone find this stupid or unfair? o.o</description>

Create an argument for no reason. Yes he does. He even had a private tour of Jagex HQ, free tickets too the first rune fest and travel paid for and a bunch of other benefits. You won’t believe me eh so I guess it won’t really matter.</p>

              <p>Hmm. Rather than removing inactive players from the high scores, I think they should just let people who have a certain amount of experience remain on the high score regardless of membership status. I’m mainly thinking about the many people with 200,000,000 exp who will lose their spot because they aren’t members anymore. Perhaps that’s the ploy Jagex is ultimately trying to play here. Perhaps they simply want to open up the top ranks to people who will remain active, to keep a constantly competitive high scores page.</p>
<p>Either way, I must say their solution is definitely members-oriented and, thereby, money-oriented.</p>

<p>I like the concept - removing inactive players from the highscores, but I don’t like the method. In fact, being high ranked and free to play would be more of an accomplishment then being a member of the same rank. They should have had it be X months without logging in (or gaining xp, whatever) or something. I agree with Taharok though, they certainly aren’t being very consistent.</p>

<p>Good point.</p>
<p>I think thought inactive should be removed from the main highscores and moved into a archive version of the high scores unless they have been logged into?</p>

<p>RS Wikia’s user base is significantly smaller than what the official RS wiki will have, not to mention I would expect a large portion of the RS wikia population to feel the obligation to push their content onto the official RS wiki, to try and “preserve” it. But it will ultimately decide upon how the official RS wiki will work. Jagex will probably have some means of censoring it, and RS wikia will always remain uncensored and undescriminated.</p>
