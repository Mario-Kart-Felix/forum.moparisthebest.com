    <description>What would you guys say is the best way to lose weight quickly? I think I&#39;m getting a little too chubby around my hips &gt;.&lt;

Problem is... I love my food, and I sometimes can&#39;t help but go for seconds (mainly sugary snacks).

^ I&#39;m a vegetarian?</description>

<p>If you’re really fat, say you consume 4-5k calories a day then if you drop down to 2500 you can safely lose about 5-10lbs a week, but that kind of diet change is hard for people to do</p>
<p>But if you’re only skinny fat then you can only safely lose about 1lb a week</p>

              <p>People often want to lose a lot of weight fast. In the process they have to make too many diet changes that they never stick with.</p>
<p>Whats the rush? Losing weight slowly will be the easiest and best way. To lose 1lb, you need to burn around 3500 calories more than you consume. If you’re average and maybe semi-active, your body probably burns near 2500 calories a day. This can vary by massive amounts, use google to help you calculate better.</p>
<p>If you set an easy goal like losing 0.5lb a week, you wont have to make many changes and this will be a healthy way to lose it.</p>

It’s basically a nutritional health shake that actually tastes good. The ‘shake mix’ (powder) smells like cake mix and tastes like it when you mix it with milk. You can mix the mix with just about anything though. For example, you can mix with the following ingredients to make it taste like Butterfingers:</p>
<p>[code]- 2 Scoops Vi-Shape Nutritional Shake Mix</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Tbsp. Sugar Free Butterscotch Pudding Mix</li>
<li>1 Tbsp. Reduced-Fat Peanut Butter</li>
<li>8-10 oz. Non-Fat Milk, or Soy, Rice or Almond Milk</li>
<li>4-6 Ice Cubes</li>
<li>Blend and enjoy[/code]<br>
The shakes replace your meal and actually fill you up (I have one everyday for lunch at my college). It will boost your metabolism and it’s also gluten free and diabetes friendly. You can also get the shake mix bags for free if you want to. As well as make money from promoting it. My mom got a free 2011 BMW 328i for being a promoter and my stepdad will be getting a 2012 BMW X5 soon.[/quote]</li>

<p>I heard about shakes and I personally think it’s a good idea, but I have no idea on how to get my hands on them lol</p>

Did it work for you?</p>
<p>[quote=“Elrick, post:14, topic:489114”]1. East healthy sugars. Granny Smith apples are amazingly sweet and tart. You said you enjoy eating so without removing food out of the equation you just need to portion control and eat healthier. Remove good stuff like Ramen, basically all candy, and treat yourself maybe once every other day.</p>
<p>When it comes to eating out, go for the healthier routes. I used to love getting the cheese covered italian bread with ham and american cheese (foot long of course), but when you look at the grams of fat, it’s pretty huge compared to tuna or even turkey. My typical subway meal consists of: 6 in. Tuna on 9 grain wheat with no cheese, a packaging of apples, and blue powerade. I avoid cheese as honestly it offers very little difference in taste and packs on the fat grams.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Remove premade food from your diet. Ramen, Spaghettios, canned chili, mac n cheese packets, all of that crap. My girlfriend and I started working on that and not only are we eating healthier, but we’re finding the food to be much more enjoyable and filling in smaller portions. Instead of heating up that bowl of spaghettios, grab a bowl of salad and croutons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WORK OUT! Do some cardio for about 30+ minutes every day and you’ll start to feel better. I run 2 miles in 30 minutes every other day and I’m not fit at all. You may not see physical differences, but you need to push yourself. After a week of 2 miles in 30 minutes I began pushing myself. I managed to cut 2 minutes off my 2 miles, then another 30 seconds, and then today I shaved off another 15 seconds. I’m not noticing a lot of difference (I’ve got the damn hip weight too) but I can tell my body is shaping up because of my time.</p>

<p>out of curiosity, what does your vegetarian diet compose of?[/quote]<br>
this, especially be more active. You can intake a lot more calories than the average and still be healthy as long as you work it off and it’s not a pile of dribble.<br>
Eating less doesn’t mean don’t eat. It means not eating till your full, eating till your content and if your slightly hungry but not hungry enough for a meal, you can still have your biscys and what not just less than what you normally have. Yeah, it wont be as a drastic change than the changes diets give you but it’s a reasonable and it will effect your diet over time.<br>
You can do a five minute job before every meal you eat (in your house so you don’t look like a plonk), it adds up and it isn’t long. Even if it’s in the adverts of your favourite TV show.</p>
