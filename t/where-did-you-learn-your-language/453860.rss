    <title>Where did you learn your language?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-did-you-learn-your-language/453860</link>
    <description>What source did you use to learn your primary scripting/programming language.
Comment link and language?
The point of this is me learning to use more than just java and python, I feel like an idiot.</description>

I played this for a while and then registered on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>, thinking it was the xeath-pk forums. I lurked for a bit before I found out the actual meaning of the forums and then I set up a small server. I wanted more and more control over what happened in my server and so I learnt the language by myself.</p>

              <p>I started with C++ way back in the day developing on what I believe was Visual C++ 6 with my cousin. His dad knew C++ and occasionally helped us out. Later I got into Game Maker, which helped me with game stuff, and then found RSPS. Here is where I got into writing working code and working with other sources. I never read a single tutorial, but rather just looked at other code and was able to piece together what did what.</p>
<p>Then I found Visual Basic 6 and stuck to that for a <span class="bbcode-i">long</span> time because that’s what ROM hacking tools were generally written in. I figured most of the stuff out on my own, and like before, looked at other code. Eventually I moved onto Visual Basic .NET, but because of it being harder, I stuck with VB6 and it wasn’t for a while that I actually decided to move up. Here is where I started getting into what I currently do now, which is designing windows, creating controls, doing other drawing stuff, making text editing applications, etc…</p>
<p>One day I decided to download Visual C# 2005 and randomly opened it and started writing code. I figured most of it out based on the intellisense, error correction, and what knowledge I had from VB .NET. For no real reason at all I stuck with it and here I am today.</p>
