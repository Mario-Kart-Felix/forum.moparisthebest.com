    <title>Really need help with NULLS!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/really-need-help-with-nulls/187779</link>
    <description>Hi I really need to get rid of nulls. I always have loads of them when theres 20 people playing theres like 28 nulls -.- I have a command

[code]                   if (command.startsWith(&quot;kn&quot;))
		{
			PlayerHandler.kickNick = null;
                        sendMessage(&quot;You kicked the nulls fat holes&quot;);
                }[/code]

That works because I get the message &quot;you kick the nulls fat holes&quot;  but it doesnt kick them, Has anyone got a command that works or If they know how to get rid of them


Thanks</description>
