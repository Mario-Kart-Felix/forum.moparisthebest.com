<p>That’s probably the whole reason this got blown up. If any one of those parents actually thought about it and considered he was their child they might realise they’re being idiots. The fact they don’t care about sending a guy to jail for 20 years when he did literally nothing to harm their children shows how shallow people really are.</p>
