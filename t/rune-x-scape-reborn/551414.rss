Hey everyone many of you know of two types of rune-x-scape 

We had a rune-x-scape ran by chris for a couple of months which had a player base of 20-30 players daily.

Then we had a rune-x-scape ran by domain .net or .org which was a deathlypvpz base but edited.

Pk-Legacy has bought out rune-x-scape domain and files which will now be professional coded together which hopefully will make a successful server


ingame content of both servers will be added over the next couple of weeks which will be applying as system updates

The content shown is pretty bland from what I’m seeing here and I’m not really pleased to see that homepage.</p>
<p>You have a weird background for the homepage that doesn’t blend well with the others, a weird slideshow that doesn’t make much sense to have with a RSPS homepage, the font and color scheme of the navigational bar makes it a bit hard to see for the homepage or at least notice, and the news and character information’s borders and what not do not match the rest of the homepage. Also, that crown used is very pixelated while the information shown shouldn’t appear until a player is logged in. You should make it show it asks a user their information then reloads the page and finally shows that information.</p>
<p>Finally, the very bottom where you have your “copyright” at shows ‘PKLegacy’.[/quote]</p>
<p>i agree with the website i have been working on a site this is only a temp template i kinda hate the layout and the slideshow pictures are default</p>
<p>with the server maybe you could give me an example of what players want ingame  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>
