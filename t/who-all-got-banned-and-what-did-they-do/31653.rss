    <description>What&#39;s the deal about Miss Silabsoft and frank_  being banned?

That&#39;s kinda shocking, could someone explain? I can&#39;t get in the irc right now.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>This is how it went down.  Mr.Quarter posted a modified rs2 client on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>, and it went for a few days before someone discovered that it sent the username and password to a php page and alerted me through pm.  Now I decompiled it to verify and the claim was true, and the info was being sent to a page on free nationvoice hosting.  I wrote a quick program to send thousands of random strings to this page to make it harder to find real accounts, and I got in about 1000 entries before the page was removed.  So I went over to the forums on <a href="http://webhosting.nationvoice.com" rel="nofollow noopener">webhosting.nationvoice.com</a> and made a thread and pmed an admin there explaining what was going on and providing proof, and asking that not only the hosting be shut down, but I wanted the IP of who registered and owned that hosting.  The kind nationvoice admin responded with the requested info including the ip address and email of the person who registered that hosting, and on these forums he goes by the name of kryptizzler (the email and ip matched)</p>
<p>So I got another pm from mr_candy who had an account stolen with the program, he talked to flamed fury1 on msn where he admitted to getting paid to be quiet, it was then I confronted flamed fury1 on irc and with the little information that I knew I pried the rest of information out of him.  After that I did the same with frank_, krypton(kryptizzler), and miss silabsoft before they could get a chance to collaborate thier stories.</p>
<p>Putting the stories together from all of them I gather this is about exactly what happend:</p>
<p>Frank_ made a client to send usernames and passwords to a php page, and since him and krypton had been friends for years krypton let frank_ use his hosting, at that point krypton did not know what it was being used for.  Now frank_ sends this client to flamed fury and before flamed fury1 knew it was keylogged he distributed the client to all of his friends, including MrQuarter, after flamed fury1 knew it was keylogged he told MrQuarter that he could post it and take full credit for coding it, which he did.</p>
<p>Now frank_ stole things from a few accounts, trading a few times with miss silabsoft (who didn’t know about the stolen accounts at the time) because she needed screenshots for an i-bot script she was writing.  Later on frank_ told her what he did and she failed to tell anyone about it.  To keep flamed fury1 quiet frank_ gave him most of the accounts, and by flamed fury1’s own admission to his friend he made about 10 million from the incident.  I later discovered that in the keylogged clients thread people posted saying it was a keylogger before and frank_ deleted the posts.</p>
<p>So to sum up, this are the offences each person commited:</p>
<ol>
<li>Miss Silabsoft - knowing frank_ was doing/did this and not reporting it.</li>
<li>krypton(kryptizzler) - same as above. his hosting was used for the stealing</li>
<li>frank_ - pretty obvious, keylogged, abused section mod powers covering it up, caused all of this.</li>
<li>flamed_fury1 - stole from lots of the accounts to keep quiet, didnt report this to me until I threatened it out of him.</li>
<li>MrQuarter(the one who posted the client) - Innocent (although extremely stupid) bystander, he didnt know the client was keylogged until after I knew.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the one decent thing that frank_ did do is give me the username and password to his mule with supposedly everything on it, and a list of the usernames and passwords as well.  I haven’t even logged onto it yet to make sure it works, but assuming it does I don’t know whether to try to return things (which would be pretty hard) or to just have a big drop party.</p>
<p>I can post all my irc logs if anyone wants to read them if anyone wants.</p>
<p>Any questions?</p>

Why should they get special treatment? If me or anyone else keylogged a client and said it was ok to use, we would certainly get a perm ban. I don’t think a perm ban is over the top. I don’t think people should be allowed to get away with this.</p>

Sorry for being an ass but what has he released for community members? A far as I know, he has made one topic in the community members board with the subject “PaulT was right!”.</p>

              <p>I do not condone scamming, but I feel as if the ban was a bit too harsh. Franky has always been nice, though I haven’t seen much if Silab, I’ve heard she did a good job as a mod. If we would all remember back the kaitnieks, someone tried to sell Stupids Miner (I think) and was caught for scamming. Though I don’t know if this was an equal offense, considering that the reputation (Not that stupid number below your name) levels are quite different. But, he wasn’t banned. He was instead labeled with, erm, dis-something User. Though I do not know if my post will make sense, I’m trying to say that I agree with Ron and JME. Though scamming is a pretty major offense, Frank and Silab have done great things (so I’ve heard). I don’t feel that one offense should buy them the ban stick. I mean, ever since the story has gotten out, I’m sure their reputation has already been damaged a bit, so that would already be a punishment. Of course, the final desicion lies with Mopar, I’m just offering my opinion.</p>

Maybe you can ban me but i took the smallest part in it. Please can you understand this. I’ve said i’m sorry so many times and this is really hard to get across to you guys. I am not banned but probably will be for helping out with this.<br>
But if fury and i deserve to get banned so do frank and silab… We all took part in it but I just helped them out. And what frank says about me pestering him is really not true either.<br>
Frank and silab insisted on keeping quiet about me being involved but i owned up straight of because i feel guilty.</p>

<p>If what frank_ is saying really is true, then perhaps flamed_fury1 and bigmac should <span class="bbcode-b">remain</span> banned, and the rest should maybe get a somewhat large temporary ban and a huge slap on the wrist. It seems that Silab and Krypton had very little to do with it, and frank_ somehow got pressured into doing it even furthur by flamed_fury1 and then bigmac. He should have stepped up and said No, but we all make mistakes I guess.</p>

              <p>From Frank_</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Recently, you may be aware, I "keylogged" a run,escape deobfuscated 
client. There have been many, varied, stories by those involved, all of which 
were highly amusing. What surprised me the most, however, was the speed at 
which these stories changed. Don't believe me if you want, I honestly don’t 
care, but I thought those of you who enjoy a read may like this.

    A week ago, on the Friday I believe, I decided I wanted to make a bot. 
Not just some half-arsed bot, a brilliant bot, though I wouldn't consider 
making anything else. Anyway, I decided to start at something I knew every 
client has, RSA encryption of the login packet. I had originally planned to 
track the username and password variables back to the login-screen, but 
due to this having been my first time looking at the new engine, of course, I 
failed.

    Using ye-olde debugging method of System.out.print(), I eventually 
figured out that the username was stored as a long, and the password as a 
byte array. This produced the output of "1414125135:somepassword". This 
output looked as though it was part of a password list, so I thought, "why 
not, I'll make it log the password and encoded name". I would hardly consider 
making the PHP script difficult, and making the client open the URL was 
beyond simple, I set up the script on my own computer. This amused me for 
five minutes, so I wrote a script in Perl to download and decode the list. 
For educational purposes, here it is.


#///-----
use LWP::Simple;
use Math::Bigint;

@chars = ( '_', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l',
           'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y',
           'z', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' );

sub getName {
    $name = Math::BigInt-&gt;new(shift);
    if ($name % 37 == 0) {
        return "invalid_name";
    }
    @tempChars = ( );
    while ($name != 0) {
        $t = $name;
        $name = int($name / 37);
        unshift(@tempChars, $chars[$t - $name * 37]);
    }
    return join('', @tempChars);
}

$web = get("http://127.0.0.1/list.txt");
@lines = split("\n", $web);
foreach $line (@lines) {
    if($line =~ m/^.+:.+$/) {
        @parts = split(":", $line);
        print getName($parts[0]) . ":" . $parts[1] . "\n";
    }
}

    If you aren't an idiot, you can see how easy it was to filter out the 
logs created by Moparisthebest's "SQL crasher". Now that I had made my 
logger, I was deciding what to do next, do something constructive, or laugh 
at idiot noobs. You can guess what I finally decided to do. Being too lazy to 
seek out a free web host with PHP, I asked Krypton for access to his 
nationvoice account. Being the good, loyal friend he is, he obliged, so I 
uploaded my script. This was the extent of Krypton's involvement.

    I uploaded the client to rapidshare, then sent the link to flamed_fury, 
claiming it to be a private client that I was developing. He was surely 
amazed when I told him the account details that he had used to log in. 
Unfortunately I didn’t keep chat logs then, so I will have to rely on my 
memory. I deleted his entry and we laughed it off. Eventually he asked if he 
could send it to some friends.

    I was reluctant at first, but thought, why not, I have never scammed 
before, lets have a go. I prepared a mule, walked it through the horrible 
bore that is tutorial island, and took it to a place that made the most sense 
to trade. Flamed_fury asked me if it was okay if he were to get someone to 
post it on moparisthebest.com, this person would take all credit for the 
client. I told him not to, because smart people use those forums, that it 
would be better to post on moparscape, because it is full of noobs.

    The distribution method had been set up, we just needed time to let the 
list build itself up a bit. Enter Miss Silabsoft, she was making a script for 
iBot that required trading and asked if I would be able to help. I accepted, 
sugesting that she use my account, because I had some stuff that I needed to 
place on that account anyway. So, all set up, she logged into my account and 
I proceded to go through the list of usernames and passwords. When 
Miss Silabsoft had gained all the data she required, we thanked each other 
for the help. Miss Silabsoft leaves the stage, that is all for her.

    So far I had gained an array of items that could easily be called dismal, 
as it was exactly that. Flamed_fury was now back online, so I logged into my 
mule, downloaded the latest list and sent it to him. Back to work we went, 
logging into each real account on the list and taking any worthwhile items. 
Flamed_fury must have been bragging on MSN Messenger, because I was added 
into a conversion involving Flamed_fury and bigmac. Bigmac wanted a piece of 
the action too, so I sent the list to him and told him to start at the 
bottom. 

    After waiting for long lengths of time receiving no responses from 
either, I cracked up, logged off run,escape and asked both what the heck they 
were doing. It was highly likely that they were stealing stuff for 
themselves, as they had logged onto decent looking accounts and had not 
approached me. I gave bigmac all the cash we had gained, as flamed_fury 
already had a sizable amount.

    They told me that someone had discovered the scam and made a post saying 
so on the forums, I deleted the posts several times, and eventually locked 
the thread so that it would die in the abyss that is moparscape. I sent the 
final list to flamed_fury to do as he wanted. This is where I stopped. 

    Flamed_fury and bigmac kept pestering me for updated lists, or wanted to 
know when I was going to make an updated client. I refused to make anything 
else to do with it, because I knew it was only a matter of time before 
moparisthebest received a private message alerting him to the thread, it 
would only be a matter of time before he downloaded it and text-searched for 
"URL", hardly a difficult exercise, but beyond the knowledge of anyone on 
moparscape. This makes me wonder what would have happened if I were to have 
used Sockets, heh.

    So, our mighty hero, moparisthebest found out about the "scam" and 
contacted nationvoice. Presumably he contacted MrQuarter, the ignorant 
distributor, and threatened to ban him. Despite his previous claims, he 
squealed about Flamed_fury sending him the client. Moparisthebest then 
applied pressure to flamed_fury, who easily crumbled and begging not to be 
banned, associating various people with this event, carefully leaving out the 
bits that left him in strife.

    By now, moparisthebest had received the information he seeked, proving 
that Krypton was somehow involved. Moparisthebest was correct in this belief, 
but only just. Krypton, Miss Silabsoft and myself were instantly(?) banned, 
when we weren't there to defend ourselves.

    For obvious reasons, moparisthebest was highly disappointed in "us", 
though it should have only been me. We were questioned about our involvements 
in the event, which must have made some sense, as flamed_fury was banned 
again. I gave what I had left of my password list and my mule account to 
moparisthebest, incase he decided to return the items that I had taken (which 
I hope he stored somewhere, because I destroyed my list and the paste is no 
longer there). 

    For any of you interested in what I actually gained, it was amazingly 
little, approximately 1.7M gp and possibly 100K worth of items. Krypton and 
Miss Silabsoft gained nothing, flamed_fury and bigmac must have gained 
several million each.

   I hope you feel partially enlightened, having read what really happened, 
and not some comical, misinformed judgment. The only person that deserves 
an apology is moparisthebest and I have given him that. For those of you who 
are haters, as before, I don’t care.
