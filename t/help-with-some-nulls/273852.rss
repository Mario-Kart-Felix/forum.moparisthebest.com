    <title>Help With Some Nulls?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-some-nulls/273852</link>
    <description>Ok so i made my server got every without a problem, made some commands, blah blah.

But i noticed yesterday that some vendors had an item considered &quot;Null&quot; which is easily known as nothing XD

but today i went to school and i didn&#39;t have the client uploaded anywhere i could get ahold of it so i used silabsoft for computer class and noticed that the items were now there, so my question how could i let the items become Unnulled i guess on my client so people can use them.

-Thanks!</description>

              <p>[quote=“MasterofPK, post:7, topic:273852”]Lol, If you have the model of the nulled item added, Go into your class8.java in your client files and find the top word (“if ID == ####”) of the item your looking for, log back into your server and spawn that ID. Then change your item.cfg.</p>
<p>If  you dont have it added then you will have to find the model/s, add it to your models folder in your client files, open class8.java just find one of the same sort, so if your trying to add a Barrows Phat, look for a Rune Phat (if your client has them) and copy the Whole Rune Phat thing… Probably easier the find a TuT on adding models or items.</p>
<p>Hope this helped.[/quote]</p>
<p>K i liked your first tut moar =P</p>
<p>K so i checkd around my Class8 file and the items ARE in there but still set as null.</p>
<p>But one thing my pickup command refuses to work no matter what i do keeps doing a invaild thing, not due to the id but due to the command i guess.</p>
<p>::pickup   right?</p>
<p>Gonna try the adding models thingy.</p>

<p>You need to change the item id in the shops.cfg to the ones that are on your client.  Say it was possible to go on a 508 server on Mopar client. Most items would be nulls, as mopar client uses different id’s.  Dragonfireshield on a 508 is 11283. On most mopar servers it is 2621.</p>

<p>Ok so if the items are in my item.cfg they SHOULD work correctly and not null? So put those ids in my shops.cfg… K i think i see.</p>
