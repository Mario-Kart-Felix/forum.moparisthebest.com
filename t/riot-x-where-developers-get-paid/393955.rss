          <blockquote>
              <p>Very well ,</p>
<p>adding 622 charachter models - done (ty to dutchboy) - please make sure this does not affect dialogues<br>
adding 633 items and objects - started - check for glitches such as firecape models and such<br>
making home cool <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> - almost done - good hope to see something original<br>
adding 508 maps - not started - in my opinion 508 maps are bugged like crazy and not worth the hassle.<br>
adding full godwars - not started - always a plus<br>
making camelot party room the shops - sounds good gives it an older server feeling<br>
making a splash screen - done (ty to dutchboy)- nice nice<br>
adding summoning - not stated - there is a good tut for a base on here<br>
adding new skill tabs - not started- nice to hear even though personally i prefer older ones<br>
adding XP toggle- not started - selection is good<br>
adding run toggle - not started- make it actually work:p<br>
adding quick prayer - not started- personally, too modern.</p>
