              <p>The black models being invisible is because some idiot decided the “Fix” for black triangles is to make the black triangles invisible.<br>
They did this by setting the color 0 (solid black) to transparent. So any model with that color (black dragonhide, black armour, etc…) will have parts or all of it invisible.</p>
<p>Fix it by going into Model.java of your client and search something like “// Nezzy” or "// 633 model"<br>
it’ll take you to a line with some non-renamed variables of an array. Something like anIntArray1340[l4] == 65535…<br>
Look for the one that has anIntArray1340[l4] == 0 and remove it.</p>
<p>Note: ALL black triangles will show on your items.</p>
