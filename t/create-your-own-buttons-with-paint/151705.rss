    <title>Create your own buttons with paint!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/create-your-own-buttons-with-paint/151705</link>
    <description>Another tutorial by me ! , I just really enjoy writing them lol.  :o :P
--------------------------------------------------------------
[b]Requirements:[/b] Microsoft paint, photoshop , any picture editer basically (if you want to create your own designs)
[b]Knowledge:[/b] Actually, this teaches how to insert your image into your html, how to make it change when the mouse
hovers over it, how to make it change when the mouse goes off again. And how to make it do something when you click on it.  :o
So, you should know how to:
-save .bmp files (very, very easy)
-understand HTML doc examples
-Know a little about HTML.
[hr]
[u]Step 1 [i]Making the Images[/i]:[/u]
Open up Microsoft Paint. It should be on most microsoft computers from Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Accsessories&gt;Paint.
Drag the white canvas to whatever size you want the button to be on the website.
Make a folder on the desktop called whatever you want. This is just a temporary place to store your two images.
[img]http://tobiasscape.fusiveweb.co.uk/Portals/26904/help21.bmp[/img]
So, once you&#39;ve made that folder, go back to paint. Design your heart out and make the button.
Save it in that folder on the desktop as button1.bmp.
Now design another button only this time, save it as button2.bmp This button image should be the button&#39;s
appearance when the mouse goes over it.
(the first image should be the button without your mouse over it)
(the second image you make should be the button when your mouse moves over it.
Once your happy you have made two images, (the same size) that have a nice effect if they were switched with
one-another, continue.
[hr]
[u]Step 2 [i]Making the HTML for the button to go in[/i]:[/u]
You should already know how to make a HTML, if not , make a notepad document in
your folder, and paste this into it:
(or just to refer to [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,207417.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,207417.0.html[/url] that link)
[code]
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;A basic button rollover&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
// this is just a place to put our rollover scripts, will be explained later.
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
[/code]
And save it as &quot;index.html&quot; as &quot;All files&quot; NOT &quot;text documents *.txt&quot;
Ive included a picture , just make sure all is right the same in this pic:
[img]http://tobiasscape.fusiveweb.co.uk/Portals/26904/help212.bmp[/img]
Ok, well done!
 Now you have made the images and the HTML, your folder (on the desktop) will look like this:
(~NEVER MIND ABOUT THOOSE ICONS, YOURS WILL BE DIFFERENT!~)
[img]http://tobiasscape.fusiveweb.co.uk/Portals/26904/help213.bmp[/img]
Well done, now we will actually start making the button.
[u]Step 3 [i]Scripting the rollovers with JScript and HTML.[/i]:[/u]
Now, right click index.html and click edit, and inbetween this:
&quot;&lt;script type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&quot; and this &quot;&lt;/script&gt;&quot;,
type this:
[code]
var timesClickedButton = 0; // declaring the variable to decide how many times youve clicked the button
function clickThatButton(){ // the start of a method, like in Java
if(timesClickedButton == 0){ // a decision making statement!
alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
} else if(timesClickedButton &gt; 0){
alert(&quot;Stop clicking me! Once is fun&quot;);
}
} // the end of a method, like in Java
[/code]
 So your entire HTML document in notepad will look like this:
[code]
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;A basic button rollover&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
// this is just a place to put our rollover scripts, will be explained later.
var timesClickedButton = 0; // declaring the variable to decide how many times youve clicked the button
function clickThatButton(){ // the start of a method, like in Java
if(timesClickedButton == 0){ // a decision making statement!
alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
} else if(timesClickedButton &gt; 0){
alert(&quot;Stop clicking me! Once is fun&quot;);
}
} // the end of a method, like in Java
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
[/code]

Now , we need to insert one image (*Button1.bmp is the button alone, so well use it*)
Somewhere between [body] and [/body] (NOT IN THE JAVASCRIPT AREA!) put this:
[code]
&lt;img src=&quot;button1.bmp&quot; name=&quot;button_1&quot; onMouseOver=&quot;window.document.button_1.src = &#39;button2.bmp&#39;;&quot; onMouseOut=&quot;window.document.button_1.src = &#39;button1.bmp&#39;;&quot;&gt;
[/code]
Now , to take this bit by bit.
[i]src=&quot;&quot; [/i]: where to find the image (in between the &quot;&quot;)
[i]name=&quot;&quot; [/i]; the name of it (can be anything, but the spaces must be _ )
[i]onMouseOver=&quot;&quot; [/i]: Bit self explanitory, but whatever is in the &quot;&quot; happens when the mouse is over the image,
in this case bieng &quot;window.document.button_1.src = &#39;button2.bmp&#39;;&quot; which is a javascript statement used to change the
src of the image that has the name, very handy :) .
[i]onMouseOut=&quot;&quot;[/i]: This happens when the mouse is off the image, in this case window.document..... makes sure the src of the image
is defanitley &quot;button1.bmp&quot;.

[b]File&gt;Save Now go to your folder and open the HTML document. (in internet)[/b]

So, altogether , your html should look like:
[code]
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;A basic button rollover&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;button1.bmp&quot; name=&quot;button_1&quot; onMouseOver=&quot;window.document.button_1.src = &#39;button2.bmp&#39;;&quot; onMouseOut=&quot;window.document.button_1.src = &#39;button1.bmp&#39;;&quot;&gt;

&lt;script type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
// this is just a place to put our rollover scripts, will be explained later.
var timesClickedButton = 0; // declaring the variable to decide how many times youve clicked the button
function clickThatButton(){ // the start of a method, like in Java
if(timesClickedButton == 0){ // a decision making statement!
alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
} else if(timesClickedButton &gt; 0){
alert(&quot;Stop clicking me! Once is fun&quot;);
}
} // the end of a method, like in Java
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
[/code]

Hope you enjoy, post any errors you get. XD

<p>then the game would be amazing lol</p>
<p>ontopic: why not just use photoshop? and make one giant sprite image and use css to position the buttons?</p>

              <h2>Another tutorial by me ! , I just really enjoy writing them lol.  :o <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">
</h2>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Requirements:</span> Microsoft paint, photoshop , any picture editer basically (if you want to create your own designs)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Knowledge:</span> Actually, this teaches how to insert your image into your html, how to make it change when the mouse<br>
hovers over it, how to make it change when the mouse goes off again. And how to make it do something when you click on it.  :o<br>
So, you should know how to:<br>
-save .bmp files (very, very easy)<br>
-understand HTML doc examples<br>
-Know a little about HTML.<br>
[hr]<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Step 1 <span class="bbcode-i">Making the Images</span>:</span><br>
Open up Microsoft Paint. It should be on most microsoft computers from Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Accsessories&gt;Paint.<br>
Drag the white canvas to whatever size you want the button to be on the website.<br>
Make a folder on the desktop called whatever you want. This is just a temporary place to store your two images.<br>
<img src="http://tobiasscape.fusiveweb.co.uk/Portals/26904/help21.bmp" alt width="" height=""><br>
So, once you’ve made that folder, go back to paint. Design your heart out and make the button.<br>
Save it in that folder on the desktop as button1.bmp.<br>
Now design another button only this time, save it as button2.bmp This button image should be the button’s<br>
appearance when the mouse goes over it.<br>
(the first image should be the button without your mouse over it)<br>
(the second image you make should be the button when your mouse moves over it.<br>
Once your happy you have made two images, (the same size) that have a nice effect if they were switched with<br>
one-another, continue.<br>
[hr]<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Step 2 <span class="bbcode-i">Making the HTML for the button to go in</span>:</span><br>
You should already know how to make a HTML, if not , make a notepad document in<br>
your folder, and paste this into it:<br>
(or just to refer to <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,207417.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,207417.0.html</a> that link)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;A basic button rollover&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script type = "text/javascript"&gt;
// this is just a place to put our rollover scripts, will be explained later.
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>And save it as “index.html” as “All files” NOT “text documents *.txt”<br>
Ive included a picture , just make sure all is right the same in this pic:<br>
<img src="http://tobiasscape.fusiveweb.co.uk/Portals/26904/help212.bmp" alt width="" height=""><br>
Ok, well done!<br>
Now you have made the images and the HTML, your folder (on the desktop) will look like this:<br>
(~NEVER MIND ABOUT THOOSE ICONS, YOURS WILL BE DIFFERENT!~)<br>
<img src="http://tobiasscape.fusiveweb.co.uk/Portals/26904/help213.bmp" alt width="" height=""><br>
Well done, now we will actually start making the button.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Step 3 <span class="bbcode-i">Scripting the rollovers with JScript and HTML.</span>:</span><br>
Now, right click index.html and click edit, and inbetween this:<br>
“”,<br>
type this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">var timesClickedButton = 0; // declaring the variable to decide how many times youve clicked the button
function clickThatButton(){ // the start of a method, like in Java
if(timesClickedButton == 0){ // a decision making statement!
alert("Hello, World!");
} else if(timesClickedButton &gt; 0){
alert("Stop clicking me! Once is fun");
}
} // the end of a method, like in Java</code></pre>
<p>So your entire HTML document in notepad will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;A basic button rollover&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script type = "text/javascript"&gt;
// this is just a place to put our rollover scripts, will be explained later.
var timesClickedButton = 0; // declaring the variable to decide how many times youve clicked the button
function clickThatButton(){ // the start of a method, like in Java
if(timesClickedButton == 0){ // a decision making statement!
alert("Hello, World!");
} else if(timesClickedButton &gt; 0){
alert("Stop clicking me! Once is fun");
}
} // the end of a method, like in Java
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now , we need to insert one image (<em>Button1.bmp is the button alone, so well use it</em>)<br>
Somewhere between [body] and [/body] (NOT IN THE JAVASCRIPT AREA!) put this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;img src="button1.bmp" name="button_1" onMouseOver="window.document.button_1.src = 'button2.bmp';" onMouseOut="window.document.button_1.src = 'button1.bmp';"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now , to take this bit by bit.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">src="" </span>: where to find the image (in between the “”)<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">name="" </span>; the name of it (can be anything, but the spaces must be _ )<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">onMouseOver="" </span>: Bit self explanitory, but whatever is in the “” happens when the mouse is over the image,<br>
in this case bieng “window.document.button_1.src = ‘button2.bmp’;” which is a javascript statement used to change the<br>
src of the image that has the name, very handy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">onMouseOut=""</span>: This happens when the mouse is off the image, in this case window.document… makes sure the src of the image<br>
is defanitley “button1.bmp”.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">File&gt;Save Now go to your folder and open the HTML document. (in internet)</span></p>
<p>So, altogether , your html should look like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;A basic button rollover&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;img src="button1.bmp" name="button_1" onMouseOver="window.document.button_1.src = 'button2.bmp';" onMouseOut="window.document.button_1.src = 'button1.bmp';"&gt;

&lt;script type = "text/javascript"&gt;
// this is just a place to put our rollover scripts, will be explained later.
var timesClickedButton = 0; // declaring the variable to decide how many times youve clicked the button
function clickThatButton(){ // the start of a method, like in Java
if(timesClickedButton == 0){ // a decision making statement!
alert("Hello, World!");
} else if(timesClickedButton &gt; 0){
alert("Stop clicking me! Once is fun");
}
} // the end of a method, like in Java
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
