<p>Bro, you need to look at this whole situation from a different angle. You are someone who came here basically asking for people to do everything for you. This community doesn’t mind helping you, we all have questions and there is always someone to answer them. You should learn how to code your server for a-couple months then you should come back to make a Development post, but don’t ask for people to do everything for you. So just start teaching yourself how to code it, that’s what I’ve done.</p>

ICodeForFame and I tried setting RSCD up on his machine but he’s not behind a router and wouldn’t let any external connections come in on port 80. It took us about an hour to find out where on earth his htdocs/www folder actually was as he had installed WAMP and xampp several times. In the end we found the htdocs folder for xampp in his My Received Files. His My Documents folder has over 12gB of RSC/RS2 ‘sources’ with literally every name you could possibly imagine. XboxScape, LeetScape, DonstaScape, you name it… When in Task Manage we also saw that he had over 10 Java applications running so he’s probably keylogged/virused up to the sky and back. Whilst we was on TeamViewer with him he accepted and ran a ‘source’ that someone sent him over MSN who had only just added him which proved he really does accept and run absolutely anything.</p>
<p>To top it off, I never saw his CPU usage under 95%. His PC specs were awful too with 1gB of RAM. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I really, really don’t think it’s the best environment to host a server.</p>

<p>Other than this which I “lol’d” at you probably are better off investing in an anti-virus such as zonealarm (zonealarm works fine if you can use it properly) &amp; also get spybot S&amp;D.</p>
<p>After that go &amp; learn abit about coding java yourself before you ask for help. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>What is your job besides taking credit for just hosting the server?</p>
<p>If people want to code a server they will code their own, if people want to make video’s they play RuneScape, and whatever ‘helping with the server’ is, most likely it is someone who just tries to be a staff member.</p>
<p>I recommend that you learn how to code yourself and then make a development post on this whole thing. Not just ask people to do everything for you.</p>
