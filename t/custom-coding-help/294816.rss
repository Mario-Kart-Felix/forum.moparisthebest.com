    <description>Okay, i got some help from someone else, and got these codes...

[size=10pt]::YELL modification[/size]

What this mod was supposed to do is tag Staff members in yell

[code]
	else if (command.startsWith(&quot;yell&quot;) &amp;&amp; command.length() &gt; 5)
	{

command.substring(5).replaceAll(&quot;no-ip&quot;, &quot;ifag&quot;);
command.substring(5).replaceAll(&quot;servegame&quot;, &quot;ifag&quot;);
command.substring(5).trim();

                if(muted == 1)
                sendMessage(&quot;You are muted and cannot yell!&quot;);
                else
                String prefix = (playerRights == 3) ? &quot;[Owner] &quot; : (playerRights == 2) ? &quot;[Admin] &quot; : (playerRights == 1) ? &quot;[Mod] &quot; : &quot;[User]&quot;;
		PlayerHandler.messageToAll = prefix + playerName+ &quot; - &quot; +command.substring(5);
	}
[/code]

My Compiler tells me this...

[code]
client.java:11269: not a statement
                String prefix = (playerRights == 3) ? &quot;[Owner] &quot; : (playerRights
 == 2) ? &quot;[Admin] &quot; : (playerRights == 1) ? &quot;[Mod] &quot; : &quot;[User]&quot;;
                ^
client.java:11269: &#39;;&#39; expected
                String prefix = (playerRights == 3) ? &quot;[Owner] &quot; : (playerRights
 == 2) ? &quot;[Admin] &quot; : (playerRights == 1) ? &quot;[Mod] &quot; : &quot;[User]&quot;;
                      ^

Press any key to continue . . .

[/code]

Also...  I wanted to know if I could make [Admin] and [Owner] Replaced with the crowns, and [Mod] replaced with its crown.



[size=10pt]Deathless Admin Mod[/size]

I never got the straight code, but i&#39;ll say it to the best of my knowledge
[code]
if (playerRights &gt;= 2);
myHP = 99;
[/code]
It was something like that so Administrators and Owners are invincible.


[size=10pt]Crown Mod[/size]

I awanted to know how to modify the crowns for staff. 


[size=10pt]Cannot Heal?[/size]

I don&#39;t know what i messed up, but for some reason, i cannot heal
