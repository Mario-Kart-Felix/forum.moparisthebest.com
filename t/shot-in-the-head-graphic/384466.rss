<p>Fuck off. This little girl died for no reason, and her head has been torn open, and you’re lolling like it’s some kind of joke.<br>
Try having this happen to someone you live with, and see if you “lol”.</p>

<p>Africa is more modernized than most people think.

Somewhat correct, the practice of cannibalism in Africa is starting to increase because of the poor economy the entire country has. They do not ‘just’ eat you though, generally the tribes will pick upon someone who is sick/dieing or has died.</p>

<p>The nuclear debris clouds causing cancer is one of the many things you have to worry about.  Those clouds are not only going to hurt humans, but everything living.  Plants, animals, etc.  And not just in a small area either, it’s pretty unpredictable how far the toxic/radioactive fallout will travel, the bomb could go off in the middle east and, theoretically, the fallout can wind up anywhere on earth (Europe, America, Asia, etc).  This could potentially kill a large portion of the crops and livestock in that area, basically taking away food supplies, and ultimately causing a famine.  So good job.  Not only did you nuke millions of innocent people in Lybia, but you also fucked over the rest of the world in one way or another.</p>

<p>Care to elaborate on what areas of Africa you are talking about…?</p>
<p>[quote=“riku9182, post:12, topic:384466”]Like what?<br>
Everyone over there deserve’s what they get.<br>
But hey, that’s just my opinion.[/quote]</p>
<p>Why did the little girl die? Did she deserve to be shot in the head? No, that would be killing off millions of innocent civilians. We can all agree that some people over there deserve to be killed, but definitely not all.</p>

<p>It’s amazing how stupid people who say things like this are. You can’t just use nuclear weapons and just walk off like nothing happened. We may have access to these weapons but that doesn’t mean we can go launching them off to destroy countries that are doing wrong. Using an unnecessary nuclear weapon is begging to start wars.</p>
