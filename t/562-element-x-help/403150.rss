    <title>562 Element X Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-element-x-help/403150</link>
    <description>Hello.

I have coded and owning 317&#39;s for a long time now.

I eventually found out I wanted to try 562&#39;s and I wanted to host one, and I picked Element-X Source/Client

But, I have putted the source up on the VPS, and putted the VPS ip into the client and compiled successfully, and each time I try I get a error_game_js5connect.

tried several sources and none work. Heard this was a common problem with 562&#39;s.

Anyone know how to solve this?
All help is greatly appreciated.

thanks</description>
