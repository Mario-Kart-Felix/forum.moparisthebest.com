    <title>Help With CentOS 5 VPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-centos-5-vps/524968</link>
    <description>I&#39;m putting this here because it was a toss up between this section and the client section. I figured that this one is more read so I&#39;d have a better chance. I installed Screen and JDK on the VPS. I uploaded my source. I typed &quot;cd RuneBalance&quot;. Then, I typed:
[code]screen -A -m -d -S RSPS java -classpath bin:deps/poi.jar:deps/mysql.jar:deps/RuneTopListV2.1.jar:deps/mina.jar:deps/slf4j.jar:deps/slf4j-nop.jar:deps/jython.jar:log4j-1.2.15.jar: server.Server[/code]
After that, I went into my client and changed the IP to the VPS&#39;s IP address. I compiled and hit run. I tried to login but it stuck on a black screen and said, maybe a minute or so later, Connection Lost, Attempting to Reestablish. I did &quot;free -m&quot; on the VPS and have the control panel open so I can see that I&#39;m running the source properly. What did I do wrong?

Source: Process-PK


If it&#39;s a bad source and client I&#39;d be really dissappointed because I already added auto donation and auto highscores :/

Thanks for your help in advance.


PS. I&#39;m not a total Linux newb. I switched to Ubuntu for like 3 months before reinstalling Windows because I was frustrated that I couldn&#39;t play my games and that if I used WINE the frames dropped. Thanks again.</description>
