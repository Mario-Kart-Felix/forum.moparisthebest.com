    <description>[move]~~~~How To Be a Pure~~~~[/move]

THE KNIGHT:

For pure fighter I would just raise attack to 40 or 60 depending on if you are a member or not. Then get strength as high as you want. Don&#39;t get defense up. 

You can wear whatever the best armour you can is, strength, power or defense ammy, and gloves, boots. (Cape is optional but gloves and boots are recomended because they bring up a couple points.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE RANGER:

For a pure ranger I would just raise range. For pking, I would use highest arrows and bow that you can. But for training I would suggest using the best bow you can with a bunch of bronze arrows. This is because they are cheap and it doesn&#39;t matter if you lose some. 

Even though you can&#39;t wear dragon hide body at lvl 40 range with only 1 defense, you can still wear the legs and vambraces. If you have lvl 40 range and everything else at 1. For pking, you can wear d-hide legs, d-hide vams, leather body and coif or cowl idk which is better. If your a member you can wear the robin hood&#39;s hat and ranger boots along with the other armour. Also, you can wear an amulet of accuracy. You can get an amulet of accuracy from some quest, I think it might be imp catcher. You can also buy them from people.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE MAGE:

For a pure mage I would get up only mage. Getting up only mage is sort of hard because you can&#39;t use a staff. If you use a staff, then it will raise whatever skill you have it set to on the weapon option screen. I recommend raising magic lvls by buying alot of laws and then teleporting to the falador alot if you&#39;re f2p and to camelot if you are p2p. 

For f2p, I would wear shade robes, mage ammy and wizard hat. For p2p, I would wear either mystic or splitbark
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NON-COMBAT SKILLS:

Cooking and Fishing is optional, you don&#39;t really have to get them up if you don&#39;t want to. It just helps if your gonna pk alot, then you won&#39;t have to buy food cause it can get expensive.

Also, I suggest getting up a skill such as mining or woodcutting. These are good money making skills. Woodcutting is way easier to get up than mining, but mining is more rewarding in the money department.

I hope this guide helped.</description>

Most likely 95-99 hitpoints. If you get the attack and strength up first, it won’t matter how much you raise ranged to because it won’t affect the combat level. Also, if the magic level does not pass the strength level it won’t affect the combat level either.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">THE MAGE:

For a pure mage I would get up only mage. Getting up only mage is sort of hard because you can't use a staff. If you use a staff, then it will raise whatever skill you have it set to on the weapon option screen. I recommend raising magic lvls by buying alot of laws and then teleporting to the falador alot if you're f2p and to camelot if you are p2p. 

For f2p, I would wear shade robes, mage ammy and wizard hat. For p2p, I would wear either mystic or splitbark if you have a high enough defense lvl.

<p>if you want to get high mage you should do that. But if you want to be a good pker then you should not do that because when you teleport it doesn’t train your hp. So you will have high mage but low hp. so you will get killed easier in the wild. If you want to make a mage pker you should just buy some runes and keep attacking things across the water in the underground thing in varrock, until you get to a certain lvl. Then you should pk and it will help your magic and your hp.[/quote]</p>
<p>kk thx</p>

              <p>[move]<s><s>How To Be a Pure</s></s>[/move]</p>
<p>THE KNIGHT:</p>
<p>For pure fighter I would just raise attack to 40 or 60 depending on if you are a member or not. Then get strength as high as you want. Don’t get defense up.</p>
<p>You can wear whatever the best armour you can is, strength, power or defense ammy, and gloves, boots. (Cape is optional but gloves and boots are recomended because they bring up a couple points.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">THE RANGER:

For a pure ranger I would just raise range. For pking, I would use highest arrows and bow that you can. But for training I would suggest using the best bow you can with a bunch of bronze arrows. This is because they are cheap and it doesn't matter if you lose some. 

Even though you can't wear dragon hide body at lvl 40 range with only 1 defense, you can still wear the legs and vambraces. If you have lvl 40 range and everything else at 1. For pking, you can wear d-hide legs, d-hide vams, leather body and coif or cowl idk which is better. If your a member you can wear the robin hood's hat and ranger boots along with the other armour. Also, you can wear an amulet of accuracy. You can get an amulet of accuracy from some quest, I think it might be imp catcher. You can also buy them from people.

<p>For a pure mage I would get up only mage. Getting up only mage is sort of hard because you can’t use a staff.

<pre><code class="lang-auto">NON-COMBAT SKILLS:

Cooking and Fishing is optional, you don't really have to get them up if you don't want to. It just helps if your gonna pk alot, then you won't have to buy food cause it can get expensive.

Also, I suggest getting up a skill such as mining or woodcutting. These are good money making skills. Woodcutting is way easier to get up than mining, but mining is more rewarding in the money department.

I hope this guide helped.</code></pre>
