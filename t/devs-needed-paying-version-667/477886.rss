    <title>Devs Needed (Paying) (Version 667)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/devs-needed-paying-version-667/477886</link>
    <description>Hello Everyone,

I am using a source called &quot;PowerSurge&quot; and i am looking for a few coders/developers.

You may ask... Well why are you paying when most good coders will do it for free?
The answer being.. i am not just looking for a one time coder, i am looking for someone that can keep coding and at-least put out one fix/new item/new gui/new anything in the game once a week.

You may also ask... Well what is the pay?
The pay is a percent of the donations that come in,So.... the better you code/add new things the more people will donate and the more money you get, And your percent will go up if you keep releasing fixs/new stuff.

You may also ask... If i helped you what are the main things you want coded?
I would like a few things coded, they are stated below.

[s]#1 There are 100 error&#39;s in the current client i am using &quot;667 client, Download link and virus scan will be below this&quot;

Client download: [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mihf4ww83oogv58/667%20Client.zip?dl=1]https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mihf4ww83oogv58/667%20Client.zip?dl=1[/url]
Client VirusScan: [url=https://www.virustotal.com/file/6e7d13f1d8cf85db7711cb0a3eacc6adae2bbddef09219567a221f72795d6a5b/analysis/1357620543/]https://www.virustotal.com/file/6e7d13f1d8cf85db7711cb0a3eacc6adae2bbddef09219567a221f72795d6a5b/analysis/1357620543/[/url][/s] [b]Fixed Myself[/b]

#2 [s]I will need someone to edit the &quot;Upgraded&quot; item bonuses to make them better then normal items. &quot;upgraded items are just lucky items with a new name&quot;[/s]  [b]Fixed myself[/b]

#3[s] I will need a web developer, that knows more then just making a forum or ripping another website.[/s] [b]Fixed Myself[/b]

#4 I will need the clan war,multi pk,safe zone areas fixed &quot;currently no one can pvp in them, i think its because the wilderness wall&quot;

#5 I will need someone that can re-arrange the home/spawn point and make it look better.

More will be needed in the future.

If you&#39;re up to coding please reply to this thread or add my skype &quot;rewardelite&quot;</description>

<p>I’m not sure what your talking about, the reason <span class="bbcode-u">for wordpress</span> is to make it a full unique handmade website…</p>
<p>IMO you shouldn’t even attempt to pay for programmers from your donations. This isnt going to be any money at all, and your best programmers that will last the longest <span class="bbcode-u">will be</span> the ones who do it for free, because they share your ideas and enjoy your leadership.</p>
<p>Edit: I thought I saw a bit of commitment thats why I applied. btw heres the top thread on Web development.</p>

<p>i understand but… if i just needed the wordpress then why wont i just use the RSC forums and website witch i have uploaded to “<a href="http://bubba-craft.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">bubba-craft.com</a>” its a forums that comes with more but… its a RIPP and thats not what i am looking for,</p>
<p>to break it down and not to flame you or try to seem mean but i am not looking for a wordpress because alot of the other servers have wordpress’s and i would like this server to be different from the others so it brings people in.</p>

              <p>I’ve been wanting to make an exceptional website for a server that plans to last. The site would be based off of Wordpress with a SMF forum, the wordpress is just to create a full site feel and open the door for some amazing graphic work. The core of the site itself will create users on the smf database and can be easily integrated with the server to add extras like  Highscores, Vote system, Professional looking Donation shops etc…</p>
<p>I have the full (paid) version of Adobe Photoshop CS6. (And know how to use it well.)<br>
I’m willing to host the website and the webclient for the server to help keep speeds to a maximum for the server.<br>
I’ve been working with RSPS’s for 8-10 months mainly focused on PI but can adapt quickly.<br>
I’m willing to spend 4 hours a day 4-5 days a week ADVERTISING/WORKING ON THE SITE.</p>
