    <title>Sapphire ATI Radeon HD 5770 1GB 128-bit GDDR5 graphics card issue</title>

    <description>This is the graphics card in my computer: [url=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102873&amp;cm_re=sapphire_ati_radeon_hd5770-_-14-102-873-_-Product]http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102873&amp;cm_re=sapphire_ati_radeon_hd5770-_-14-102-873-_-Product[/url]. I built this PC that I&#39;m running about a year ago and had terrible luck with parts. I&#39;ve replaced everything except the hard drive, the optical drive, and the PSU, including this graphics card. Now my problem is that the driver keeps on crashing, and on games that my computer should have no trouble running, EX: Minecraft. I can run it at above 60 FPS on render distance far and graphics fancy, but my graphics card driver will just randomly give out. It happens all the time with different games (among other things just sitting there and running programs EX: Eclipse) and I&#39;m getting really irritated. I&#39;ve checked for driver updates and there are none. Is something else wrong?

PC Specs:

CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 995 @ 3.20 GHz
RAM: 4 GB 1333 DDR3 (2 2GB sticks)
Motherboard: ASRock M3A785GXH/128M AM3 AMD 785G HDMI ATX AMD Motherboard
OS: Windows 7 Professional
PSU: APEVIA ATX-CW500WP4 500W ATX Power Supply

Any help would be greatly appreciated.</description>
