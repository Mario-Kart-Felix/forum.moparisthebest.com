    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ive-been-gone-for-a-while-and-need-to-get-caught-up/247867</link>
    <description>There&#39;s a few questions that I have after being gone for quite a while (I think over a year now?).  Has anyone developed (and released) saving servers?  Last I checked I had to restart every time I wanted to log in again, if not I will =P.  Has anyone made a server with all skills?  Are NPC&#39;s closer to being at the RS2 server&#39;s level? (tbh, last time I checked, that isn&#39;t very good, but its been over a year)  Is there anything else I should be filled in on, I&#39;m not sure how long I&#39;ll be around?</description>

<p>But basically, I do know what the good ol’ days were. I’ve been here before the first demonik (I forgot which version it was, I think v2) was released, I’ve even been here before Glass Dagger was released.</p>

              <p>There’s a few questions that I have after being gone for quite a while (I think over a year now?).  Has anyone developed (and released) saving servers?  Last I checked I had to restart every time I wanted to log in again, if not I will =P.  Has anyone made a server with all skills?  Are NPC’s closer to being at the RS2 server’s level? (tbh, last time I checked, that isn’t very good, but its been over a year)  Is there anything else I should be filled in on, I’m not sure how long I’ll be around?</p>
