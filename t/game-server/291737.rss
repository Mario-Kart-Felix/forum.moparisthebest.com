    <description>Ok ive been reading up on sockets and i am going to write a game server for my simple little sprite game but im a bit confussed how would i get the client to track movement from the server to the client. Do i have send the procsess from the client to the server then the server sends any movement to the other client connections? I tryed to make my question as easy as possiable to to understand if neeeded i would try to rephrase.</description>

TCP doesn’t give you the degree of control that is desirable in games, not to mention that its policy regarding packet order simply doesn’t work for any real-time game.</p>
<p>[quote=“ry60003333, post:14, topic:291737”]If your going to build some kind of acknowledgment system on top of UDP, just use TCP.</p>
<p>Plus Jagex used TCP. :eek:[/quote]<br>
No, bad idea. If you use UDP then you could split outgoing packets up into ‘channels’ (ie, one channel for packets that must arrive, the other for packets that don’t have to arrive).</p>
<p>Acking is a simple matter really. You simply send a packet with structure similar to the following:<br>
uint16 sequence_number<br>
uint32 bitfield</p>
<p>The bitfield allows you to ack 32 packets in one go using bitmasks, which means each sequence number can be acked precisely 33 times. If you sent about 30 packets a second then you’d need 1 whole second of packet loss to stop any given packet from being ack’d.<br>
Obviously the sequence_number is the number of the primary packet that is being ack’d by this packet, and the bitfield would ack sequence_number - 1 through to sequence_number - 32.</p>

              <p>IMHO UDP is the best protocol to use in games where latency is important. Though it takes more work to use than TCP, because in practise it will require a custom protocol on top of it. The advantage is however that this custom protocol can be fine-tuned for the needs of the concrete game and even to each concrete packet.</p>
<p>This is kinda what Sony Online Entertainment does with its MMORPGs (Everquest, Everquest 2, Starwars Galaxies, etc).</p>
<p>For certain key packets (such as player login) you will probably want all the features TCP provides (arrival, integrity and ordering), but for many games, for a position update, for example, you will want to minimize the latency. The approach some games take is to send the current client-side position of a player every few msecs whenever it’s moving. (For example, every 500 msec). That information however is not used directly. Instead, either the server or the clients themselves try to predict the actual position of the player, accounting for the latency. If, for example, 1 of 3 position update packets was lost, all that would happen is that the client/server wouldn’t be able to predict the actual position of the player so accurately, at least until it receives a valid packet. Of course, many variations of this would exist, and in some cases it would be necessary, similar to what mopman described, to send an acknowledged packet every so often to make sure that the position of a given player is accurate.</p>

              <p>It also matters on what type of ‘walking’ system you have. Runescape does it nicely since the user specifies the destination, then the server calculates the walking path. But if you do a system where an action moves the player distance x and/or distance y, it’s still going to be costly network-wise when a bunch of people are all moving at the same time. Hence why predicting the paths are of utmost importance to save network bandwidth and network processing server-side.</p>
<p>And who cares whether it’s absolute or relative coordinates. Unless he’s making a massive game, he won’t be dealing with very large numbers anyway.</p>

<p>Since when the client is sending the new position of the player (which should only be done if the player has been moved, right?) and the server is updating all the player’s clients. As well the server would be predicting where the new position would be like zstars had said. The reason because if their is some issue with the sending of the packet, the server would be able to actually move the player to where it thinks the client is.</p>

              <p>If it is a tiled game typically you will send a position update packet everytime each player or NPC moves. If movement is not restricted a common approach is to send a position update every x milliseconds (every 500 ms, for example) whenever the player is moving. In these usually the server or clients try to predict the movement to compensate for the latency.</p>
<p>Note that the update packet can either be absolute (new global coords of the unit), or relative (displacement from latest known unit position).</p>

              <p>Ok ive been reading up on sockets and i am going to write a game server for my simple little sprite game but im a bit confussed how would i get the client to track movement from the server to the client. Do i have send the procsess from the client to the server then the server sends any movement to the other client connections? I tryed to make my question as easy as possiable to to understand if neeeded i would try to rephrase.</p>
