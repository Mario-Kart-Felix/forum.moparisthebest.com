What you are applying for : server sided coder<br>
Why do you think that your the right person for the job : Because in the past i have owned, ran, hosted, coded over 20 different server sources so i think i’m the man for the job. I have no evidence at current but if you really want i can spend about 5 months on coding a server just to pove it. i have currently been away from the pc so i may be a little bit “rusty” but full order will continue within a few days</p>
