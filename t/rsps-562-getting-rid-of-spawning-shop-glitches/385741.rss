    <title>RSPS 562 - Getting rid of spawning &amp; shop glitches</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-562-getting-rid-of-spawning-shop-glitches/385741</link>
    <description>Hey guys,I was wondering if someone can teamview with me or add my msn
shadowbmx99@hotmail.com.

This is because I am having trouble fixing my shops since,everytime I buy an item,it gives me the next item to the right.

Furthermore,I also need help removing spawn for regular players.
Anyone graceful to help me out?:)I&#39;l give you admin if you&#39;d like.
Note:The server wont be up for a while until I&#39;m done fixing some of the mini&#39;s and interfaces.
Thanks!

Yours truly,Danny.  :cool:</description>
