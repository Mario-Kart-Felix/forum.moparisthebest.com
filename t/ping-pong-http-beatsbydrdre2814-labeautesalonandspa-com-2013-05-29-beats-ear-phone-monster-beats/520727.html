Kermit the Frog, that Muppet of Muppets, has got to have other Celebrities green with envy. He’s converting 50 years old next month but doesn’t look per day over… well, he or she looks pretty much just like in the mid-'50s, when he created some of his earliest performances with puppeteer pal John Henson on the local Washington, D.C. TV show, “Sam and Friends.” And Kermit doesn’t seem to have aged a day since getting his star-making breaks in the late 1960s, in the telefilm “Hey Cinderella” and on the children’s TV series “Sesame Street.” "Well, you know, it’s interesting being 50,Inches Kermit said in a current interview with Elp Television News. “You start to reflect on your life. And you also look back over the years at everything you’ve ever completed. And, with age, middle age comes wisdom. However have to say that I’m unsure that 50 personally is the same as 50 inside people years.” In honor of Kermit’s birthday, Buena Vista Home Entertainment has just released “The Muppet Show: Season One,” a four-DVD container set that delivers almost all 24 episodes of the very first season of the range series, which actually aired from 1976-81. “(It) has never been unveiled in its entirety before; this is the first time,” Kermit mentioned. “And, on there, not only do most of us have those amazing invitee stars like Soft sand Duncan and Candice Bergen and Ruth Buzzi, Florence Henderson – all those original individuals that worked with us in the '70s. But we have the original tape that we did to try to offer ‘The Muppet Show,’ as an extra, which I don’t even think the public has seen prior to.” Other Dvd and blu-ray bonuses include the unique “Muppet Show” pilot, in which Kermit hardly appeared, as well as a first-season fun reel. Besides the Muppets on their own, “The Muppet Show: Season One’s” celebrity attractions are, certainly, the star sights, including such figures as Lena Horne, Vincent Price and also Ethel Merman.    no previous page following    1/2  <a href="http://monsterbeats235.labeautesalonandspa.com/2013/05/29/beats-studio-red-box/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">beats studio red box</a><br>
