    <description>how would i do it :)? i am trying to go around all the mysql stuff with the vote4cash type deal and i made a simple command that links you to the votes pages and gives you 10 pk points and 10m everytime you vote but how can i make it so the command can only be used once an hour to stop ppl from using it over and over?

here is the command i made
[code=java]if (playerCommand.equals(&quot;forums&quot;)) {
				for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++)
					if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {
						Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[j];
						c2.getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?action=up&amp;server=tainted-pkz.no-ip.org&quot;, 12000);
						c.getItems().addItem(995, 10000000);
						o.pkPoints += 10;
						c.sendMessage(&quot;You receive 10 pk points and 10m for voting you can do this once every hour.&quot;);
					}
			}[/code]

please if someone could add a 1 hour timer or help me do so i would be so greatfull

if not thanks for your time anyways!</description>
