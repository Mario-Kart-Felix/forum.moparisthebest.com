    <description>Heres something i wrote that is basically about what annoys me, i find it a good stress reliver to tell others about what pisses me off, so here it is... Please don&#39;t post if you don&#39;t read it... and please dont read it if you cba because its just something i wrote for the hell of it.
No flaming either.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[u]Hi there, my names dave.
 I&#39;d like to tell you what annoys me.[/u]

[b]Lets get started.[/b]
- I know life is unfair, i aknowledge that and dont really care.
- Drugs are fine, i&#39;ve never done them, and if you do them good for you!
- I am not religious, and im completely fine with other religions... if its what other people believe then good for them.

[b]A little about something tragic that happend to me a few months ago:[/b]

&quot;I was tested for drugs at school, its turned out positive for: [canabis &amp; benzodiazipan]&quot;
&quot;This was a very traumatic experience for me&quot;
&quot;I proved my innocents by getting a professional hair test costing £100&quot;
&quot;I showed the evidence to the acusants and they didn&#39;t even bother to look or aknowledge it&quot;
&quot;I have never been forgiven, not to his day 5+ months later.&quot;

[b]So that happened... and sure i got angry, but its life, its unfair and im completely and utterly fine with that.[/b]

[i]Let me go into more detail about how i view religions: 
Well every religion is fine, I dont believe in any of it, but the people who do are happy doing it, i always think of
that saying : &quot;Ignorance is bliss&quot; when i think of religion... because the people who believe in religion are happy
doing it, and it makes them stronger. I am neither calling any religion ignorant or saying they are fake... it&#39;s my
own belief, i respect others beliefs and they respect mine. [/i]

[u][B] So now onto my story [/u][/b]
Its thursday mornings school, its assembly morning, its the religious studies teachers turn to take the assemblyl. 
Great i think to myself, thats cool just sit there and listen and learn. &quot;Goodmorning everybody, we have a special 
speaker in today to talk about his experience with finding god.&quot; Said the Religios Studies teacher.
My eyes took sight of a scrawny 30 year old looking guy, whom i immidiatly thought of as &quot;Drug addict&quot;. 
The guy began telling us all a story about how when he was younger he was peer-pressured into doing drugs, this 
immidiatly shows me that he is a weak person. Sure people like this piss me off, i mean they get to have fun doing
drugs and never get caught - and that annoys me because i was punished for what he did.(A bit like jesus i supposed,
dying for others sins). So i sit there as usual half listening to a drug addict, his stories went on to say how
he went on to do more heavy drugs and how his life went down hill alot. Good for him i suppose. 

Then comes the dreadful moment... he mentions turning to religion - great i knew it! i knew religion had to be in there
somewhere, oh and this is the happy ending, he found a religion and it helped him stop doing the drugs. Yes i was right
thats what happened! 

Ok happy ending for him....

But now whats he saying? that i need to find god... to be forgiven of my sins and he doesnt care about what ive done in the
past. And if i do not find god i am going to hell? Oh thats just fucking dandy, lets just list whats happened:

- A drug addict has openly addmitted infront of me, and lots of other whitnesses that he was/is a drug addicted [b]
and[/b] has supplied others with drugs (making him also a dealer). This annoys me because even though he has 
admitted it, he will never be punished for it - yet i never have done drugs and i do get punished for it.

- A drug addict is telling me to worship a god. Thats fucking gay, i don&#39;t go up to his face and tell him god
isnt real, and neather should he tell me what/who to worship. In his so called holy book it says do onto others
as you wish to be dealt (or something along the lines of that) So this basically says that Christians in particular
wish to be harassed and told there faith is wrong.



So thats what pisses me off.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

You lost your friends because they now think you’re a drug addict? Seriously, those werent your friends anyway.<br>
Real friends wouldnt do such a thing.[/quote]</p>
<p>^^ Agreed, real friends wouldn’t just ditch you if you took drugs, or even became a proper drug addict, who just spends all his time trying to get to another high. Real friends would help you or at least accept that you take drugs. And if you don’t take drugs real friends would believe you.</p>
<p>Even thought all that ^^ sounds cheesy. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

I believe what Mopman is trying to tell you is that there are drug users out there who are responsible. Not every drug user is an addict. (I’m not questioning your intelligence, just making sure you got the point :p).</p>

Believe it or not but life IS fair.<br>

think about the past? well as i meditate regularly it teaches me not to live in the past, nor the future, and that i should be only thinking of the present. Which is partly true<br>
you never EVER need to worry about the past… its gone and you can never change it, partly you need to prepare for the future, but more-ly you need to concentrate on the present.<br>
btw right now im partly intoxicated with alochol.[/quote]<br>
i’m not telling you to think about the past, im telling you not to do bad things in the present cause soon or later there will happen something bad to you.</p>

you never EVER need to worry about the past… its gone and you can never change it, partly you need to prepare for the future, but more-ly you need to concentrate on the present.<br>
btw right now im partly intoxicated with alochol.</p>

              <p>Good read, and I agree with those points you had there.</p>
<p>I actually think that no religious study lesson I have had during these eleven years of compulsory religious studies in different schools has ever taught me to worship to any god. They, more or less, just teach you about how to live as a Christian (if you have decided to live as one, that is) and to understand other religions.</p>

<p>[quote]<span class="bbcode-u">Hi there, my names dave.<br>
I’d like to tell you what annoys me.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Lets get started.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>I know life is unfair, i aknowledge that and dont really care.</li>
<li>Drugs are fine, i’ve never done them, and if you do them good for you!</li>
<li>I am not religious, and im completely fine with other religions… if its what other people believe then good for them.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">A little about something tragic that happend to me a few months ago:</span></p>
<p>“I was tested for drugs at school, its turned out positive for: [canabis &amp; benzodiazipan]”<br>
“This was a very traumatic experience for me”<br>
“I proved my innocents by getting a professional hair test costing £100”<br>
“I showed the evidence to the acusants and they didn’t even bother to look or aknowledge it”<br>
“I have never been forgiven, not to his day 5+ months later.”</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">So that happened… and sure i got angry, but its life, its unfair and im completely and utterly fine with that.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Let me go into more detail about how i view religions:<br>
Well every religion is fine, I dont believe in any of it, but the people who do are happy doing it, i always think of<br>
that saying : “Ignorance is bliss” when i think of religion… because the people who believe in religion are happy<br>
doing it, and it makes them stronger. I am neither calling any religion ignorant or saying they are fake… it’s my<br>
own belief, i respect others beliefs and they respect mine. </span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">[B] So now onto my story </span>[/b]<br>
Its thursday mornings school, its assembly morning, its the religious studies teachers turn to take the assemblyl.<br>
Great i think to myself, thats cool just sit there and listen and learn. “Goodmorning everybody, we have a special<br>
speaker in today to talk about his experience with finding god.” Said the Religios Studies teacher.<br>
My eyes took sight of a scrawny 30 year old looking guy, whom i immidiatly thought of as “Drug addict”.<br>
The guy began telling us all a story about how when he was younger he was peer-pressured into doing drugs, this<br>
immidiatly shows me that he is a weak person. Sure people like this piss me off, i mean they get to have fun doing<br>
drugs and never get caught - and that annoys me because i was punished for what he did.(A bit like jesus i supposed,<br>
dying for others sins). So i sit there as usual half listening to a drug addict, his stories went on to say how<br>
he went on to do more heavy drugs and how his life went down hill alot. Good for him i suppose.</p>
<p>Then comes the dreadful moment… he mentions turning to religion - great i knew it! i knew religion had to be in there<br>
somewhere, oh and this is the happy ending, he found a religion and it helped him stop doing the drugs. Yes i was right<br>
thats what happened!</p>
<p>Ok happy ending for him…</p>
<p>But now whats he saying? that i need to find god… to be forgiven of my sins and he doesnt care about what ive done in the<br>
past. And if i do not find god i am going to hell? Oh thats just fucking dandy, lets just list whats happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A drug addict has openly addmitted infront of me, and lots of other whitnesses that he was/is a drug addicted <span class="bbcode-b"><br>
and</span> has supplied others with drugs (making him also a dealer). This annoys me because even though he has<br>
admitted it, he will never be punished for it - yet i never have done drugs and i do get punished for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A drug addict is telling me to worship a god. Thats fucking gay, i don’t go up to his face and tell him god<br>
isnt real, and neather should he tell me what/who to worship. In his so called holy book it says do onto others<br>
as you wish to be dealt (or something along the lines of that) So this basically says that Christians in particular<br>
wish to be harassed and told there faith is wrong.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So thats what pisses me off. [/quote][/quote]</p>

<p>A drug addict is telling me to worship a god. Thats fucking gay, i don’t go up to his face and tell him god<br>
isnt real, and neather should he tell me what/who to worship. In his so called holy book it says do onto others<br>
