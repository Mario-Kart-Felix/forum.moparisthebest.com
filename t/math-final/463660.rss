    <title>Math Final</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/math-final/463660</link>
    <description>Tomorrow, I have to take my Math Final Exam, which will consist of matrices, functions, polynomial expressions, and factoring (which I&#39;m terrible at). I&#39;m about to review over all of the content in the chapter that discusses factoring, but it is really hard to interpret some of the things. I know this is the general discussion board (not general questions), but I was wondering if anyone could show me their ways of factoring and possibly even show me example of how to factor different types of equations.</description>

<p>I’ll try to find some more that I’ve had problems with. Also, if you could, please create a list of steps of how to factor it. Highlighting would be great. :D[/quote]<br>
Alright, keep in mind I might not be using correct terms, but this is how I understand it.</p>
<p>[ol][li]9x^4 - 24x^3 + 16x^2 = 0   —   Original equation[/li]<br>
[li]You can tell how many answers you need by how[/li]<br>
[li]x^2(9x^2 - 24x + 16) = 0   —   Take out the x^2 as that’s the most you can currently simplify it.[/li]<br>
[li]Pretend that the x^2 that you just took out isn’t there for a second. We’ll come back to that later.[/li]<br>
[li]Take the (9x^2 - <span class="bbcode-b">24</span>x + 16) = 0 and factor it out like normal. How I would figure out what the 2 expressions in the middle is by taking the first number in this case 9 and multiplying it by the 16. This would give you 144. Now, you look at the middle number which is <span class="bbcode-b">24</span> and see what two numbers multiply to equal 144, yet add to equal <span class="bbcode-b">-24</span>. With that in mind, you only have 2 sets of numbers that would work: 12 &amp; 12 or -12 &amp; -12. Since you have to add the set of numbers so that it would equal the <span class="bbcode-b">-24</span>, it is obviously the second set of numbers -12 &amp; -12 as the sum of the two equals <span class="bbcode-b">-24</span>.[/li]<br>
[li]Now your equation will look like this: (9x^2 -12x -12x + 16) = 0.[/li]<br>
[li]Now basically look at this equation as two seperate expressions that split here: (9x^2 - 12x <span class="bbcode-b">|</span> -12x + 16) = 0[/li]<br>
[li]Part A is: 9x^2 - 12x and Part B is: -12x + 16.[/li]<br>
[li]Now let’s start with Part A, take out the greatest common factor between the 9 and the -12. The greatest common factor would be 3x. Now divide 3x from the 9 and the -12  so Part A will look like 3x(3x - 4)[/li]<br>
[li]Do the same for Part B, take out the greatest common factor from it which would be <span class="bbcode-b">-4. -4</span>(3x -4)[/li]<br>
[li]Now, take a look at the expressions you have in the parentheses; the (3x-4)s. Since the parentheses of Part A and Part B match, that’s one of your answers*.[/li]<br>
[li]Then take a look at the numbers to the left of the parentheses in Part A and Part B. For Part A it would be 3x and for Part B it would be <span class="bbcode-b">-4</span>.<br>
Combine those together so it would be 3x<span class="bbcode-b">-4</span>. That would be your second answer*.[/li]<br>
[li]The reason I put an asterick next to the word answer is because you’re not done yet.[/li]<br>
[li]Remember you put aside the x^2 earlier, now put them all together. x^2(3x-4)(3x-4)=0, that is as simplified as you can get generally unless told otherwise by your teacher. That is your final answer.[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>Also, if you need to solve for X rather than just simplifying, this part is easy as well. Just set your previous two answers* to equal zero. Since both of your answers* were the same, this part is very simple.<br>
3x - 4 = 0<br>
3x = 4<br>
x = 4/3</p>
<p>Keep in mind, I mapped almost if not ALL steps. It is usually a lot faster, but as you wanted a list of steps, I tried to explain all of them to help you understand. I hope it doesn’t confuse you.</p>

<p>I currently have a review sheet, but that still doesn’t give me any tips on how to do them properly. Also, that is one form of an equation that we factor.</p>
<p>Edit: My teacher is really great and knows what she is doing, but she really doesn’t show us how to do things. That is how it has been for the past 2 years in high school, which is why I  gave up and lost my 4.0 GPA.</p>

              <p>Are you trying to factor things like x^2 - 16x + 55? Also, you could try homework help I guess, it seems a bit more fitting. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Tomorrow, I have to take my Math Final Exam, which will consist of matrices, functions, polynomial expressions, and factoring (which I’m terrible at). I’m about to review over all of the content in the chapter that discusses factoring, but it is really hard to interpret some of the things. I know this is the general discussion board (not general questions), but I was wondering if anyone could show me their ways of factoring and possibly even show me example of how to factor different types of equations.</p>
