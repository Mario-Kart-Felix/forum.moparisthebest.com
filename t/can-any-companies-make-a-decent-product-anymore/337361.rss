    <title>Can any Companies make a decent product anymore?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-any-companies-make-a-decent-product-anymore/337361</link>
    <description>Well to begin with my families house is about 10 years old and its in a pretty nice neighborhood. Every major applicance has gone out since we have bought it and we have replaced all of these, this includes:

Heat Pump
Dishwasher
Stove
Built-in Refridarator
Water Heater
About every water faucet

For the record we treat all of our appliances nicely (including wiping off all of the dishes before we put them in the dishwasher and cleaning them regularly).

Today the shower faucet broke (delta piece of shit) never buy a faucet branded delta unless you want leaky fauces that area POS
Also today THE 3 YEAR OLD DISHWASHER KITCHENAID broke a water control valve cracked on it. All of these are American products and ALL OF THEM SUCK MAJOR DICK.

So the question is can American companies make any decent fucking product anymore? My grandparents said that their used to be refrigerators that would last 50 years and now the quality of products has all gone to shit.</description>

I don’t think that’s a very logical conclusion.[/quote]</p>
<p>the microchip is protected with some kind of black harden molten plastic laminated the chip or i dont know what it is but the chip is protected and it’s not like I took the coffee maker and tossed it on the floor it had no damages but yes i guess it’s possible some leads i haven’t seen got rusty or burnt i don’t know all I know is that it powers up and everything works the clock works only the buttons if you press them they do nothing and the leads to the buttons etc are soldered and nothing wrong there (remember it used to work before for a few years).</p>
<p>But why am i even talking about it i tossed it into the trash a month ago it was in mint condition other then some dust.</p>

just because the microchip failed doesn’t mean they implemented a timer. i don’t believe any company would do something like that because they’d get in so much shit if they were found out.</p>
<p>is it possible to reverse engineer a microchip to find out exactly how it functions? if so, you should try it.</p>

<p>Yes exactly see what im saying all newer products suck dick. My sister has a smaller sony tv in her from from the 1990’s and it works perfect so I see there and my grandparents have a bunch of sony lcds around their house with no problems yet but we bought this one about 3 years ago and it just shit on us I think it was the tube or something. Before that we had a Mitsubishi television which lasted a really long time.</p>
