          <blockquote>
              <p>I’ve been reading up on this as I do want to do online high school.  Here’s what I found on one of the websites.</p>
<blockquote>Pros:
<p>• You can work at your own pace, taking time when you need it and speeding through courses that are easy.</p>
<p>• You have greater flexibility in your schedule and can arrange your classes around work and other responsibilities.</p>
<p>• It’s easier to avoid the distractions (peers and parties) of regular school and focus on getting work done.</p>
<p>• Many students see it as a way to develop their own identity, apart from the social pressures of traditional schools.</p>
<p>• You won’t have to put up with the “bad influences” or bullies.</p>
<p>• You may be able to specialize in learning subjects that are interesting to you.</p>
<p>• Some students are able to earn their diploma early (a few even finish twice as fast as traditional students).</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>• Most online programs don’t have the fun elements of traditional high schools such as prom, senior day, graduation, weird hair day, etc.</p>
<p>• Some subjects (such as writing and math) may be hard to master without a teacher present.</p>
<p>• Many people find it challenging to focus on completing work when there isn’t an actual teacher there to encourage them on a daily basis.</p>
<p>• Some students become isolated or anti-social.</p>
<p>[b]• If your online school is not accredited, your transcripts probably won’t be accepted by businesses and universities.</p>
<p>• Unless you find an accredited charter school, you can expect to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars on tuition, curriculum, and computer equipment.[/b]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I bolded the 2 big cons for me.</p>

I’ve gone to Florida Virtual School so here’s exactly what it’s like,<br>
Work is hard - but easy to find on google.<br>
Get all your work done fast if you use this method. ^<br>
Dick around the house/town all day.<br>
Play Runescape.<br>
Social life? Your in highschool and I’m sure just like me you know many kids who’ve dropped out or skip already.<br>
Text whenever you want.<br>
Wake up when you want.<br>
It’s great honestly if you can get the work done.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Could you make a list of pros/cons like he asked. Example: How do college’s feel about this?  (My cousin goes to online school, but I think she honestly doesn’t understand why she has to do it.  My ‘step-grandfather’, who was CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield wants me to do better and school, and since she started going to this online school she has been getting 3.5 GPA.  And I only want to impress my Grandpa because he is paying for 1/2 of my college costs so I need him to like the school that I will be going to.)[/quote]<br>
Colleges? Same as if you went to highschool and made a 3.5 GPA.<br>
All you gotta do is not put off the work and you’ll be fine, I suggest doing it but if you’re liable to get lazy, I’d stay in High School.</p>
