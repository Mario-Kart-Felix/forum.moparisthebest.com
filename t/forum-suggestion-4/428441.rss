    <title>Forum suggestion #4</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/forum-suggestion-4/428441</link>
    <description>Okay well I have noticed that topics get &quot;grave digged&quot; and/or &quot;bumped&quot; all the time  even though they are so many years old. I suggest that after a three month period the topic gets &quot;auto locked&quot; and an auto message is placed into the thread stating why and stating that if you need help with this topic or wish for this to be unlocked just ask a member of staff.&quot;

why am I suggesting this? well quite frankly I just got &quot;watched&quot; for telling a ...poster...lets just call him that... bumping a dead, useless, two year old topic that will never have any true meaning. Am I mad? nah just a suggestion so others don&#39;t get &quot;watched&quot; for something that should had never occurred in the first place. To sum up my thoughts I leave you with this thought:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While we are free to choose our actions, we are not free to choose the consequences of our actions.

 Stephen R. Covey&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So what am I saying? There would be no consequences of telling somebody the truth if a bumped/gravedigged topic never got reactivated by ...&quot;posters&quot; ...

<p>I’m not saying any system is 100% there will always be defects but it would just be legitmately easier to just have topics after so long be locked. A person can always make a new topic and be like " original thread is here gives links  my problem is blah blah blah " In MOST situations a two-three year old topic won’t have the original owner still looking at it either due to the person not being active anymore or the person just doesn’t care. In reality most topics that old are just purely outdated in sense of tutorials at least.</p>

Already been summed up nicely, but gravedigging is not against the rules, except in cases where the topic would normally warrant a lock even if it wasn’t old. There are a few special cases that may require/suggest an old topic to be locked, but it really shouldn’t happen often <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>You must have misunderstood david. He means that when the bumped posts are deleted, the topic will go back into the depths of the board, so people won’t continue posting on it.</p>
<p>We can’t help if someone posts something legitimate in a topic that’s 2 years old, and a bunch of forum members start flaming them for “gravedigging.” All we can do is post an explain it’s legitimate.</p>
<p>As for all this locking you’re suggesting, I’m simply not understanding it. Locking is used as a last resort, only. It’s either used as a mechanism to stop posting in a topic that does not need replies, or to stop continual off-topic discussion in a topic that’s not worth keeping open. Neither of these apply to the majority of gravedug threads. Why should they be locked if they can just be pushed back to where they came from if they were illegitimately bumped?</p>

<p>So to sum things up, gravedigging is replying to a very old topic, whilst providing no new information, correct?<br>
Also, when replying to such a post, the text in the Quick Reply box says</p>
<blockquote>[b]Warning: this topic has not been posted in for at least 120 days.

Well the reason that it’s not that way is because there are very legitimate topics that are inactive. Gravedigging defined by the rules is when you post on an extremely old topic with a useless non-contributing post.<br>
Edit:<br>
Also there are very old topics that are very active.<br>

<p>No. Gravedigging is not in the rules.</p>
<p>I swear, I just posted on this exact thing in another suggestions topic not even a month ago. Gravedigging hasn’t been considered a rule for a long time. The reason is very quite simple: most topics that aren’t locked after being solved still have the potential of being a query for someone later on.

<p>It was a similar topic but not exactly the same views <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Read through the others posts as well. Many people have suggested instead of "locking " old topics making such things as a text box to appear asking twice if you are sure you wish to post here and if you understand the consequences for posting irrelevant material into this topic.</p>

              <p>Yea, this is a good idea. Because right now if you want to revive a topic you can:<br>
A. Post in the old topic and get called a grave digger.<br>
or<br>
B. create a new topic and get told by other people that a thread already exists with this topic.<br>
If you remove option A then creating a new topic would be acceptable.</p>
