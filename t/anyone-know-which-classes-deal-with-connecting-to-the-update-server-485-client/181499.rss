              <p>Sure; I’ll elaborate. I agree (though less vehemently) with _frank.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, 377 is where literal strings were removed. This also happens to be the last version of the <span class="bbcode-i">old engine</span>. I don’t have my archived sources in front of me, but I don’t recall anything spectacular happening in 420/421. I think around 450 something was the enhancement of their internal VM. (Which I’m waiting for them to further enhance)…</p>
<p>Unhandled: I really don’t think you did yourself a favor by speaking/replying. You indicated that you have at least read some posts, but make no mistake, tinkering around with a few posts and some other developer’s code does not make you an expert. It takes a long time for you to be able to wear the big-boy diapers and actually make fun of someone. It’s incredibly trite to say</p>
<p>[quote=“Unhandled, post:4, topic:181499”]…<br>
Yes, it’s possible to disable to whole update server process<br>
…[/quote]<br>
I mean… come on, of course <span class="bbcode-i">anything</span> is possible. The real question; one that would imply truly abstract thought and understanding would be to ask whether it is a good idea to do so. It is simply more work than it is worth to end up with something that is only of clientside (or less) worth.</p>

How would that help? The classes are are butchered up/static so that nothing is where it should be. Before 421 I think, the client class had most of the strings you’d see, now in 421+, they randomly strewn throughout the classes. amiwrong?</p>
<p>Yes, it’s possible to disable to whole update server process, but you’d want start refactoring so you have at least some idea what your doing. I’m taking it your not a moparscaper who wants a 485 clinet for ur pikkerisrlyleetscape servar?[/quote]<br>
Not technically a moparscaper because i really dont like that site its full of idiots who dont know what the hell they are doing, But yes i am looking for a way to remove the update server process so that i can connect to a 481 server but i dont know if thats gonna work or not, ive read alot about it and someone has already logged in on a 484 client to a 481 server.</p>
