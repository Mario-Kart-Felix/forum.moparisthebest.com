    <description>How would i make an NPC appear for a player, only after he/she has done an action. 

(Kills a NPC, a NPC appears and STAYS for that player forever, but only that player can see it)

Thanks ^.^</description>

              <p>That actually sounds like something too work on xO, kind of like Summers End on RuneScape, for the Corporeal Beast… although I’d have no idea too do this, especially since I think your using a 317 xP. I’ve never done 317’s, I started RSPS about 4 months ago. But I see what your sayingg xO.</p>
