    <title>Player updating procedure - Netty</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-updating-procedure-netty/380463</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;ve been stuck on this for quite a while now. The client receives all the packets (messages throughout chat (opcode 253), player&#39;s id (opcode 249), camera (opcode 107), etc) but player updating (opcode 81). For some reason, the server can encode it and write it out using the ChannelBuffer but the client isn&#39;t receiving it to decode and use it accordingly. Would anyone happen to know why?</description>
