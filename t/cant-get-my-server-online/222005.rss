    <title>Can&#39;t get my server online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-get-my-server-online/222005</link>
    <description>Okay so I&#39;m making my server.  I have started editing it and adding new places and objects but I can&#39;t seem to get my server to get online.  I have No-ip downloaded and I have my No-ip address, I have port-fowarded, and I logged in and had my friend try to log in and he couldn&#39;t get on.  Did I miss anything?</description>
