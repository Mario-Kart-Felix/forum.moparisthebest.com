    <title>More advance droprates?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/more-advance-droprates/429522</link>
    <description>I this is an idea i had while i was gething high and talking about runescape cuz i just got my server online yesterday.

Heres the idea:
ok i found out that even when you set the drop rates for lets say bgsby graador at 1 on 100 and when the boss dosent drop much other items. it drop the rare items more often.. so i was wondering what if we add more money but put the drop rate lower . u guyz think the rare items will drop more rarely so we could keep a steady eco? sorry if its not strured rigth im stoned atm :) please comment.</description>

If you want better, or more rare droprate, then it’s just to change the 1:100 to 1:250 or something :o<br>
^ That’s what you mean?</p>
