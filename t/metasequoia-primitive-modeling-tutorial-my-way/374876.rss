    <description>[center][size=14pt][b]Metasequoia Modeling Tutorial:
&quot;Primitive Sketch&quot;[/b][/size][/center]

[b][size=12pt]WARNING: Large Pictures, May Require Scrolling[/size][/b]

Well I mentioned a new modeling method I&#39;ve been using lately, so I&#39;ve decided to share it. Hopefully you&#39;ll get something out of it :)

[b]Step 1a:[/b] Sketch what you want to make. I usually make swords, but it can be anything you want. Just make sure you know what you want to put the most detail into for both the sketch and model.

[b]Step 1b:[/b] Actually [b][u]draw the wireframe[/u][/b]. Although it may sound confusing, draw lines where you think the model would look neatest, and where the object&#39;s edges would be if it were in real life. Make sure you can see these lines and distinguish them from the rest of the sketch. Also, it isn&#39;t necessary for you to draw wireframe lines on very simple parts such as handles or simple hilts, as you should be able to make them easily on your own.
[img]http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/1945/scan0002d.png[/img]

[b]Step 2 (optional):[/b] Scan or take a picture of your sketch and add it into the [b]Top[/b] perspective (The Img button at the top of the screen). This will help you when you&#39;re putting together the model.
[img]http://img253.imageshack.us/img253/2338/metaimage1.png[/img]

[b]Step 3:[/b] Build from simpler parts of the model to the more complex. In other words, if your handle is simpler, make that first. This will be good to base the proportions of the rest of the model. If the image is in Meta, try to line it up as best as you can. If you can&#39;t, don&#39;t worry, nobody is perfect, nor can they make a 100% perfect sketch :P

[b]Note: Use the RECTANGLE or ROPE tools when selecting vertices using this method, or else you won&#39;t select the ones at the bottom of the object.[/b]

[b]Step 4a:[/b] Make the rest of your model. It would be a good idea to make a new object here, in case you accidentaly mess with the simpler part of the model. Also, make the other objects invisible to make working with this part easier. Create the needed primitives, segment them, rotate, scale, etc. Line up the edges with the wireframe you drew on your sketch. Not only will this make the model stay neat, but it won&#39;t get messed up much at all :D Either turn off faces (Fc button) so you can only see your wireframe on top of your sketch&#39;s, or leave faces on and choose a color and transparency that you can work with. If you are doing that, then make sure you have both the Top and Perspective views shown at once, that way you can see how well you are lining the primitives up. Also, if you need all of your primitives to be the same size, C&amp;P them and move them around your model and join the vertices later, it has to be done sometimes.
[img]http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/2773/metaimage3.png[/img]

[b]Step 4b:[/b] If you C&amp;P&#39;d, select all of the objects and move all faces to a new object. Delete the previous objects, and start finishing your model. Connect any vertices that need to be connected, make your model look nice, etc. Make it look like you wanted it to in your sketch!
[img]http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/3672/metaimage4.png[/img]

[b]Step 5:[/b] Put it all together. Make the other objects visible again, line them up, scale them accordingly, add colors, and make it all come together to make one nice model :) Save it, render it, share it! (and triangulate if you are going to release ;) ) 
[img]http://img585.imageshack.us/img585/192/finished.png[/img]

And you&#39;re done! :D



I hope this helped everyone! Consider this my Christmas Gift to Moparscape&#39;s Modeling community ;) Who knows, maybe more modelers will arise! I can&#39;t wait to see what you guys can come up with!

[center][size=18pt]MERRY CHRISTMAS![/size][/center]</description>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 3:</span> Build from simpler parts of the model to the more complex. In other words, if your handle is simpler, make that first. This will be good to base the proportions of the rest of the model. If the image is in Meta, try to line it up as best as you can. If you can’t, don’t worry, nobody is perfect, nor can they make a 100% perfect sketch <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note: Use the RECTANGLE or ROPE tools when selecting vertices using this method, or else you won’t select the ones at the bottom of the object.</span><br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 4a:</span> Make the rest of your model. It would be a good idea to make a new object here, in case you accidentaly mess with the simpler part of the model. Also, make the other objects invisible to make working with this part easier. Create the needed primitives, segment them, rotate, scale, etc. Line up the edges with the wireframe you drew on your sketch. Not only will this make the model stay neat, but it won’t get messed up much at all <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Either turn off faces (Fc button) so you can only see your wireframe on top of your sketch’s, or leave faces on and choose a color and transparency that you can work with. If you are doing that, then make sure you have both the Top and Perspective views shown at once, that way you can see how well you are lining the primitives up. Also, if you need all of your primitives to be the same size, C&amp;P them and move them around your model and join the vertices later, it has to be done sometimes.<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 4b:</span> If you C&amp;P’d, select all of the objects and move all faces to a new object. Delete the previous objects, and start finishing your model. Connect any vertices that need to be connected, make your model look nice, etc. Make it look like you wanted it to in your sketch!<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 5:</span> Put it all together. Make the other objects visible again, line them up, scale them accordingly, add colors, and make it all come together to make one nice model <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Save it, render it, share it! (and triangulate if you are going to release <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )<br>

<p>And you’re done! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I hope this helped everyone! Consider this my Christmas Gift to Moparscape’s Modeling community <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Who knows, maybe more modelers will arise! I can’t wait to see what you guys can come up with!</p>
<p>[center][size=18pt]MERRY CHRISTMAS![/size][/center]</p>
