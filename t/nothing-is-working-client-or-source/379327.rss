    <description>First off, i&#39;m not sure if this is in the right section, i did check before i posted and didn&#39;t see anything.

anyway, my problem is iv&#39;e download many (about 5-6) client or sources and everytime i try to run them i get some kind of error most of the time it&#39;s this one
&quot; The system cannot find the path specified &quot;
I have my environmental variables set to..

PATH - C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin
CLASSPATH - C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin
