    <title>Music Player?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/music-player/386899</link>
    <description>Hey Guys,

Was wondering if there was any way I could implement .mid music files into my client / server to allow it to play inside the music player ingame.  I know the client will have to play it but the server will have to recognize when you click the button and send that info off to the client?

Does anyone have any ideas or tried it before?

EDIT:  On 317 client/source</description>
