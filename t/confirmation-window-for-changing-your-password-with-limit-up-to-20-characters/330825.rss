    <title>Confirmation window for changing your password (with limit up to 20 characters)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/confirmation-window-for-changing-your-password-with-limit-up-to-20-characters/330825</link>
    <description>Alright, this will be my second tutorial being made for these forums. My first one was deleted when they were cleaning out the tutorial section when they were adding the filter. It took me two hours to type up, so..... dammit, lol.

[b]Source:[/b] DeltaScape, but it can easily be modified to fit your server, assuming you have knowledge.
[b]Difficulty:[/b] Easy
[b]Classes modified:[/b] client.java, clickingMost.java

Okay. Well, the main reason I made this for my server was because I was bored as hell, but the main reason you SHOULD have this and the purpose of it is to stop those annoying hackers telling you to type ::passage to change your password to &quot;ge&quot;, ::passmemoney to change your password to &quot;emoney&quot;, etc. Now, I know others have found ways around this scam by changing their ::pass command to ::changepass or ::changepassword, and when you type ::pass it&#39;ll simply send you message telling you the new command to change your password, but this will be a way to ensure the user 100% that they will be changing their password. This tutorial is also very good for people that change their password and end up mistyping it and when they log out and try to log back in later, they find out that their password is invalid. This tutorial will stop those problems too.

This is a preview of what it will look like in-game after you have added it:

-----

Alright, let&#39;s move on to adding it. Open up your client.java.

The first thing we&#39;re going to do is declare a string:

[code=java]public String confirmPass = &quot;&quot;;[/code]

Why declare this? That will be explained in a second.
-----

Next, go to your command that changes the player&#39;s password. Mine is ::changepass, so I have modified it to this:

[code=java]if (command.startsWith(&quot;changepass&quot;) &amp;&amp; command.length() &gt; 11) {
if(command.substring(11).length() &gt; 20) {
sM(&quot;Your password length is limited up to 20 characters.&quot;);
return;
}
confirmPass = command.substring(11);
sendFrame126(&quot;Are you absolutely sure you wish to change your password to&quot;, 360);
sendFrame126(command.substring(11)+&quot;?&quot;, 361);
sendFrame164(359);
NpcDialogue = 499;
}[/code]

Alright, now to explain the command.

[code=java]if(command.substring(11).length() &gt; 20) {
sM(&quot;Your password length is limited up to 20 characters.&quot;);
return;
}[/code]

This obviously limits the command to only allow up to 20 characters. It&#39;s taking the command.substring(11) and it&#39;s saying if the length of this is above 20, to send this message and basically cancel out the rest of the command, hence the return;.

[code=java]confirmPass = command.substring(11);[/code]

This bit sets the string that you declared a little earlier to the password that you chose. We needed to declare a string for this because we needed to make it so when you click &quot;Yes&quot; to confirm the password change, it will set the player&#39;s password to whatever confirmPass is. This was pretty much the only way to get the &quot;Yes&quot; option in the confirmation window to be functional and set your password to whatever you typed before the confirmation window appeared. It &quot;stores&quot; the password so it won&#39;t forget it.

[code=java]sendFrame126(&quot;Are you absolutely sure you wish to change your password to&quot;, 360);
sendFrame126(command.substring(11)+&quot;?&quot;, 361);
sendFrame164(359);[/code]

This is pretty self-explanatory. This makes the two-lined window appear in your chat box with the &quot;Click here to continue.&quot; button, with command.substring(11) being the password obviously.

[code=java]NpcDialogue = 499;[/code]

This sets the NpcDialogue to 499 so when we click the &quot;Click here to continue.&quot; button, it will send the information to packet 40, because clicking this button activates packet 40, which deals with the npc dialogue, and if the NpcDialogue equals 499 when packet 40 is activated, then it will proceed to display the yes or no options, which we will be adding to packet 40 right now. Why the number 499? It was a randomly chosen number by me.
-----

Search for &quot;case 40:&quot; in your client.java. If you have the correct case 40, then you should see a bunch of stuff involving NpcDialogue below it. Right below the text &quot;case 40:&quot;, add this:

[code=java]if (NpcDialogue == 499) {
NpcDialogue = 500;
choice(&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;);
}[/code]

If the NpcDialogue equals 499 when you click the &quot;Click here to continue.&quot; button, which it will, it will then display the yes and no buttons and set NpcDialogue to 500 to make them function correctly.

It may be possible that you don&#39;t have the &quot;choice&quot; method. Check if you do and if you don&#39;t, then simply declare this:

[code=java]public void choice(String text, String text2){
            changeText126(&quot;Select an Option&quot;, 2460);
            changeText126(text, 2461);
            changeText126(text2, 2462);
            sendFrame164(2459);
}[/code]

Save your client class, we&#39;re done with that.
-----

Open up your clickingMost.java now, we will be editing that.

Search for &quot;case 9157:&quot; in your clickingMost class. Case 9157 works with the first option, which in this case is &quot;Yes&quot;. Underneath this, you should once again see a bunch of stuff working with NpcDialogue. Add this into case 9157:

[code=java]if(c.NpcDialogue == 500){
c.closeAll();
c.playerPass = c.confirmPass;
c.sendFrame126(&quot;You have successfully changed your password to&quot;, 360);
c.sendFrame126(&quot;\&quot;&quot;+c.playerPass+&quot;\&quot; (Without the quotes.)&quot;, 361);
c.sendFrame164(359);
c.sM(&quot;Your new password is \&quot;&quot;+c.playerPass+&quot;\&quot; (Without the quotes.)&quot;);
c.sM(&quot;Your new password is \&quot;&quot;+c.playerPass+&quot;\&quot; (Without the quotes.)&quot;);
c.sM(&quot;Your new password is \&quot;&quot;+c.playerPass+&quot;\&quot; (Without the quotes.)&quot;);
c.confirmPass = &quot;&quot;;
}[/code]

This is saying if NpcDialogue equals 500 (which it does now according to the last piece of code we added) and case 9157 is activated (which is done by clicking on &quot;Yes&quot;), Then it will close the current interface, change your account&#39;s password to whatever confirmPass equals, and it displays the window in the chat box telling you that you have successfully changed your password to whatever your new password is. Once you click &quot;Click here to continue.&quot;, it will then send you three messages telling you your new password. (I made it send three times to ensure that the owner of the account knows their new password. If you don&#39;t want it to send three times, simply remove two of them.) After all that is done, it will set confirmPass back to &quot;&quot;, which is nothing.

Wait, we&#39;re not done yet. We still have to make the &quot;no&quot; option work correctly. So search for &quot;case 9158:&quot;. This works with the second option, which in this case is &quot;No&quot;. Inside of this, add this:

[code=java]if(c.NpcDialogue == 500){
c.confirmPass = &quot;&quot;;
c.closeAll();
}[/code]

This simply says if NpcDialogue equals 500 and the button &quot;No&quot; is clicked, change confirmPass back to nothing, close the interface window in the chat box, and basically cancel the whole thing. Setting confirmPass back to nothing after clicking &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; isn&#39;t really required for this whole thing to work, but it was just something I decided to add.
-----

There it is, you&#39;re all done. If you have any problems with adding anything or you encounter any errors, then post them below. I&#39;ll be more than happy to help sort out your problem. Otherwise, post what you think of this. I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts.

Credits go 100% to me for this. Again, I was bored as hell and decided to make this nifty feature for my server. I&#39;ve never seen a server that has anything like this and that&#39;s what I shoot for. I shoot for new and unique things.</description>

You should do when you click on ‘no’ that it says<br>
sendMessage(“Password confirming canceled by user”);<br>
Would be better</p>

<p>Obviously you’re doing something wrong because if you weren’t it’d work. The best I can tell you really is go through the tut again because I explained everything well and clear.</p>

Looks bloody awesome.</p>
<p>But i type in ::changepass (password) and it comes up with the “are you sure you want to change your password to (password)?”</p>
<p>I click the “click here to continue” and the dialogue box goes back to the chatbox and nothing else comes up.</p>
<p>I’ve followed your guide exactly right…i think x]. i’ve gone through it all 3 times and cant pick a mistake i’ve made.</p>
<p>Any Suggestions :)?<br>

<p>Make sure <code>NpcDialogue = 499;</code> is inside of your ::changepass command and make sure <code>if (NpcDialogue == 499) {
NpcDialogue = 500;
choice("Yes", "No");
}</code> is inside the correct case 40 and isn’t interfering with any of the other code inside of it.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes that is all right.</p>
<p>I just copied and pasted everything out of the tutorial.<br>
Its defiantly the right case 40, has a whole heap of npc dialogue. There is another case 40 but im certain thats the wrong one ;).</p>
<p>when i search <code>NpcDialogue = 500;</code> the only one that comes up is the one in that code, same with <code>NpcDialogue == 499</code> So im certain it isn’t interfering with anything else.</p>

              <p>That’s what all of the password changing commands do, but for some odd reason, it still remains a way to scam someone. Adding this into your server makes it a more professional password changer and more stable in my opinion. It’s not just a simple ::pass [newpass] then it sends you one message in you chat box that you may not catch. This way ensures that the user in fact wants to change their password because they must click through a series of windows in order to do that.</p>
<p>Also, the reason I decided to limit the command to only allow 20 characters is because that’s the limit it goes up to when you’re typing in your password on the login screen. It prevents those problems too. I don’t know why people are so against this tutorial. &gt;.&gt;</p>

              <p>by making the command using command.startswith, you make it so if the command starts with “pass” and still has anything after it it will still count, but command.equalsIgnoreCase just couts it if it has just pass in it</p>
<p>edit: lol nvm that was an idiotic suggestion…</p>
<p>what would really work though, is making it tell you that you changed your pass when you do ::pass</p>

When people login, you should make them add a secret question, then add make them type it in when they change it, that would be way secure.</p>
<p>I know that’s not what the tut is about, but would be pretty good.</p>
