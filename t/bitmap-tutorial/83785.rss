    <description>[b][center][size=30pt]Bitmaps!!!!!!!![/size][/center]

 
I use bitmaps every chance I have and I love them, so I decided to share the magic of bitmaps with
everyone!!!!!!!  I hope you all enjoy, and I made it very easy to unserstand for everyone.

[b]Important[/b]
First of all, you will need photoshop to do this tutorial and know the basics of scar/srl.


What are bitmaps?
A bitmap is a picture, but all of its colors/pixels are turned into a bunch of numbers that scar can read.

Are they hard to make?
They are extremely easy to make, just read the tutorial below and you will see for yourself.


In this tutorial, I will be making a bitmap of the [I]Chop Down[/I] option for choping down a tree in runescape.  You can make a bitmap of ANYTHING though.  Desktop Icons, buttons, games, ANYTHING.

[b]1[/b].) To start, make it so what you want to make a bitmap of is on the screen.  In this tutorial, ill have runescape open so the chop down option is on the screen.  After that, push the [I]Print Screen[/I] button on your keyboard which is near the top right of your keyboard.


[IMG]http://img366.imageshack.us/img366/8667/rightclickingtreeyi3.png[/img]


[b]2[/b].) Now open up paint and either push [I]Ctrl + v[/I] or go to [I]Edit[/I] and click on [I]Paste[/I].  You will now see 
a picture of the screen at the excect moment you pushed [I]Print Screen[/I].  You need to save this now so go to [I]File[/I] and click on [I]Save As [/I](make sure you remember where you save it). You can now close [I]Paint[/I] because you wont need it anymore.   


[IMG]http://img366.imageshack.us/img366/7039/saveasrightclickjw7.png[/img]


[b]3[/b].) Now open up your photoshop, &quot;Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0&quot; in my case.  Go to  [I]File[/I] and click on [I]Open[/I].  Go to where you saved the picture from the previous step and open it.  I like to use a grid while making bitmaps so I can see the pixels much much easier(not needed though, just useful).  To turn in a grid, click on [i]View[/i] on the top menu bar and click on [I]Grid[/I] so it will have a check next to it.  You now have a grid on your picture to help. (To change your grid preferences, go to [I]Edit[/I] --&gt; [I]Preferences[/I] --&gt; [I]Grid[/I].  Below is a picture of my personal grid preferences.

[IMG]http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/6572/gridpreferencestg9.png[/img]


[b]4[/b].) Now, zoom in so you can see the pixels easier by either pushing [I]Ctrl + +[/I] or go to [I]View[/I] and click on [I]Zoom In[/I].  I like to zoom in as much as possible to help me see the pixels(max I can go is 1600%).


[IMG]http://img366.imageshack.us/img366/5968/zoomedinclosedu8.png[/img]


[b]5[/b].) Now, click on the tool that selects parts of a picture [IMG]http://img366.imageshack.us/img366/679/pixelboxselectorgt4.png[/img] .  [B]You 
should always select as few pixels as possible to prevent lag. So never choose the entire picture, only a small piece of the picture that is unigue to what&#39;s around it.   [/B]


[IMG]http://img366.imageshack.us/img366/2309/selectedpixelszj1.png[/img]


[b]6[/b].) Now, once you have selected what you wanted to make a bitmap of, go to image and click on [I]Crop[/I]. Now you will only see the selected pixels you wanted.


[IMG]http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/7964/cropedimagees8.png[/img]


[b]7[/b].) Go to [I]File[/I] and click on [I]Save As[/I] and name is whatever you want(ChopDown in my case).  Save it onto your [I]Desktop[/I] and click [I]Save[/I](make sure you save it as a .BMP).  A window will pop up.  On this window, choose 32 bit.  See the picture below for what it should look like.


[IMG]http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/367/box32bitkh6.png[/img]


[b]8[/b].) Now open up scar and click on [I]Script[/I] and then on [I]Picture To String[/I].  


[IMG]http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/1253/stringtopictureen5.png[/img]


[b]9[/b].) Now a little window will pop up called [I]Bitmap Loader[/I].  Click on the [I]Open[/I] button and go to where you saved the picture from step 7.  Click on it once and then click [I]Open[/I].  There will now be a picture of it in the middle of the window.


[IMG]http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/3138/pictureinbitmapcentertr3.png[/img]


[b]10[/b].) Now just click [I]Ok[/I] and you will see the bitmap on the bottom of your scar window in the debug box.


[IMG]http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/5503/bitmapdonepo5.png[/img]


[b]11[/b].) Now just use this in your script and your done!


Here is one way you could use it in a script:
[code]Program ChopDownTree; //name the script whatever you want, ChopDownTree in my case
{.include SRL/SRL.scar} //this script uses srl functions, so this is required

var
  ChopDown : Integer; //bitmaps must always be declared as variables here

Procedure LoadBitmaps; //this loads the bitmaps so they can be used later in the script.
  begin
  ChopDown := BitmapFromString(54, 1, &#39;z78DA737343000324E0862&#39; +  //the 54,1 means its 54x1 pixels 
       &#39;16EEA626A62624E6B715CA41BDDDD096113A30B008C164C9F&#39;); 
end;   

Procedure FindTheTree; //this procedure will chop down a tree (name it whatever you want)
begin
  if(Findcolor(x,y,3035208,5, 5, 515, 338))then //finds the tree in the box using a color(I picked 3035208 using the Color Picker, and the 5,5,515,338 make up a box it will look in.  They are the x1,y1,x2,y2 coords.  You set these yourself because that is where it will be looking for the color)
  begin 
    Mouse(x, y, 0, 0, False); //right clicks the tree
  end;
end;

Procedure ChopDownTheTree; 
begin
  if(FindBitmap(ChopDown, x, y))then //finds the bitmap that we made
  begin
    Writeln(&#39;Foundthe bitmap, clicking it now.&#39;); //types a message in the debug box if the bitmap is found (not needed)
    Mouse(x, y, 0, 0, True); //left clicks the bitmap
  end else //if it doesnt find the bitmap
  begin
    Writeln(&#39;Sorry, it didn&#39;t find the bitmap, terminating script.&#39;); //types a message if it didnt find the bitmap(not needed)
    Terminatescript;  //terminates the script
  end;
  FreeBitmap(ChopDown) //frees the bitmap to prevent lag after the bitmap is used once
end; 

begin //main loop (this puts the procedures we made into use)
  SetupSRL; //required to have if your using srl functions
  LoadBitmaps; //put this in your main loop so it will load the bitmap
  FindTheTree; //this will find the tree using the procedure we made
  ChopDownTheTree;  //this will chop down the tree using the procedure we made
end.[/code]
The bitmap(s) you use must always be put in as variable(s) at the top.
This little script finds the tree and right clicks is.
Then it looks for the bitmap we made, left clicks that, and types in a message saying we found it.
Then we use FreeBitmap to prevent lag(use this for all bitmaps you use after they are used in the script)
This script isn&#39;t made to be used, its just an example of how a bitmap would be used and how some of the script functions work.

Bitmaps can be used for much more than this, but the picture you make a bitmap of must always be exact because bitmaps look for specific pixels in an exact order.  I have listed some other ways to find a bitmap below though, and they are more reliable.

I use bitmaps all I can because they are so easy to make and work every time.

I hope this helped everyone who didn&#39;t completely understand how to make and use bitmaps.


Also some useful tips:
 -  You can fill in parts of the picture you dont want scar to look for by making them black.
 -  Bitmaps are great for finding symbols on the minimap in runescape
 -  Finding items in your inventory if you dont know how to make DTMs
 -  They are great for other games other than runescape
 -  Much, much more.:)

There is much more information about how bitmaps are used in the SRL manual [URL=http://&quot;http://www.srl-forums.com/forum/offical-srl-download-t3410.html?t=3410&quot;]HERE[/URL](on the right side of the page, it&#39;s called SRL Manual.rar).  In this manual are all the srl functions, but they are ver yconfusing if you dont know scar very well.

I hope this has helped you make and use bitmaps for scripts you make in the future.

And if you have any problems, feel free to send me a private message or post here.  If there were any steps that could use more information, please tell me and I wll be glad to improve it.  Im here to help and i will always be glad to help.  I hope this has helped everyone learn more about bitmaps.</description>

              <p>I just got a good version of hypercam, so I think  I will make a package of a bunch of viedeo tutorials with step by step notes at the bottom of the screen as it goes.  Some are gonna be Dtms, Bitmaps, Basics, Seting up players, Getting scar working, and a bunch of other stuff.  Is there a way to make a box or soemthing pop up with a coulple of buttons which you can choose which tutorial you want?  That would be best so when you open it up, just chose the tutorials and it will show it.</p>

At the end, there is the <span class="hashtag">#5</span>, this is a tolerance so the color doesnt need to be exact.

              <p>[b][center][size=30pt]Bitmaps!!![/size][/center]</p>
<p>I use bitmaps every chance I have and I love them, so I decided to share the magic of bitmaps with<br>
everyone!!!  I hope you all enjoy, and I made it very easy to unserstand for everyone.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Important</span><br>
First of all, you will need photoshop to do this tutorial and know the basics of scar/srl.</p>
<p>What are bitmaps?<br>
A bitmap is a picture, but all of its colors/pixels are turned into a bunch of numbers that scar can read.</p>
<p>Are they hard to make?<br>
They are extremely easy to make, just read the tutorial below and you will see for yourself.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I will be making a bitmap of the <span class="bbcode-i">Chop Down</span> option for choping down a tree in runescape.  You can make a bitmap of ANYTHING though.  Desktop Icons, buttons, games, ANYTHING.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1</span>.) To start, make it so what you want to make a bitmap of is on the screen.  In this tutorial, ill have runescape open so the chop down option is on the screen.  After that, push the <span class="bbcode-i">Print Screen</span> button on your keyboard which is near the top right of your keyboard.</p>
<p><img src="http://img366.imageshack.us/img366/8667/rightclickingtreeyi3.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2</span>.) Now open up paint and either push <span class="bbcode-i">Ctrl + v</span> or go to <span class="bbcode-i">Edit</span> and click on <span class="bbcode-i">Paste</span>.  You will now see<br>
a picture of the screen at the excect moment you pushed <span class="bbcode-i">Print Screen</span>.  You need to save this now so go to <span class="bbcode-i">File</span> and click on <span class="bbcode-i">Save As </span>(make sure you remember where you save it). You can now close <span class="bbcode-i">Paint</span> because you wont need it anymore.</p>
<p><img src="http://img366.imageshack.us/img366/7039/saveasrightclickjw7.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">3</span>.) Now open up your photoshop, “Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0” in my case.  Go to  <span class="bbcode-i">File</span> and click on <span class="bbcode-i">Open</span>.  Go to where you saved the picture from the previous step and open it.  I like to use a grid while making bitmaps so I can see the pixels much much easier(not needed though, just useful).  To turn in a grid, click on <span class="bbcode-i">View</span> on the top menu bar and click on <span class="bbcode-i">Grid</span> so it will have a check next to it.  You now have a grid on your picture to help. (To change your grid preferences, go to <span class="bbcode-i">Edit</span> --&gt; <span class="bbcode-i">Preferences</span> --&gt; <span class="bbcode-i">Grid</span>.  Below is a picture of my personal grid preferences.</p>
<p><img src="http://img366.imageshack.us/img366/5768/turninggridonbw5.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<img src="http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/6572/gridpreferencestg9.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">4</span>.) Now, zoom in so you can see the pixels easier by either pushing <span class="bbcode-i">Ctrl + +</span> or go to <span class="bbcode-i">View</span> and click on <span class="bbcode-i">Zoom In</span>.  I like to zoom in as much as possible to help me see the pixels(max I can go is 1600%).</p>
<p><img src="http://img366.imageshack.us/img366/5968/zoomedinclosedu8.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">5</span>.) Now, click on the tool that selects parts of a picture <img src="http://img366.imageshack.us/img366/679/pixelboxselectorgt4.png" alt width="" height=""> .  <span class="bbcode-b">You<br>
should always select as few pixels as possible to prevent lag. So never choose the entire picture, only a small piece of the picture that is unigue to what’s around it.   </span></p>
<p><img src="http://img366.imageshack.us/img366/2309/selectedpixelszj1.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">6</span>.) Now, once you have selected what you wanted to make a bitmap of, go to image and click on <span class="bbcode-i">Crop</span>. Now you will only see the selected pixels you wanted.</p>
<p><img src="http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/7964/cropedimagees8.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">7</span>.) Go to <span class="bbcode-i">File</span> and click on <span class="bbcode-i">Save As</span> and name is whatever you want(ChopDown in my case).  Save it onto your <span class="bbcode-i">Desktop</span> and click <span class="bbcode-i">Save</span>(make sure you save it as a .BMP).  A window will pop up.  On this window, choose 32 bit.  See the picture below for what it should look like.</p>
<p><img src="http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/367/box32bitkh6.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">8</span>.) Now open up scar and click on <span class="bbcode-i">Script</span> and then on <span class="bbcode-i">Picture To String</span>.</p>
<p><img src="http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/1253/stringtopictureen5.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">9</span>.) Now a little window will pop up called <span class="bbcode-i">Bitmap Loader</span>.  Click on the <span class="bbcode-i">Open</span> button and go to where you saved the picture from step 7.  Click on it once and then click <span class="bbcode-i">Open</span>.  There will now be a picture of it in the middle of the window.</p>
<p><img src="http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/3138/pictureinbitmapcentertr3.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">10</span>.) Now just click <span class="bbcode-i">Ok</span> and you will see the bitmap on the bottom of your scar window in the debug box.</p>
<p><img src="http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/5503/bitmapdonepo5.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">11</span>.) Now just use this in your script and your done!</p>
<p>Here is one way you could use it in a script:</p>
<p>[code]Program ChopDownTree; //name the script whatever you want, ChopDownTree in my case<br>
{.include SRL/SRL.scar} //this script uses srl functions, so this is required</p>
<p>var<br>
ChopDown : Integer; //bitmaps must always be declared as variables here</p>
<p>Procedure LoadBitmaps; //this loads the bitmaps so they can be used later in the script.<br>
begin<br>
ChopDown := BitmapFromString(54, 1, ‘z78DA737343000324E0862’ +  //the 54,1 means its 54x1 pixels<br>
‘16EEA626A62624E6B715CA41BDDDD096113A30B008C164C9F’);<br>
end;</p>
<p>Procedure FindTheTree; //this procedure will chop down a tree (name it whatever you want)<br>
begin<br>
if(Findcolor(x,y,3035208,5, 5, 515, 338))then //finds the tree in the box using a color(I picked 3035208 using the Color Picker, and the 5,5,515,338 make up a box it will look in.  They are the x1,y1,x2,y2 coords.  You set these yourself because that is where it will be looking for the color)<br>
begin<br>
Mouse(x, y, 0, 0, False); //right clicks the tree<br>
end;<br>
end;</p>
<p>Procedure ChopDownTheTree;<br>
begin<br>
if(FindBitmap(ChopDown, x, y))then //finds the bitmap that we made<br>
begin<br>
Writeln(‘Foundthe bitmap, clicking it now.’); //types a message in the debug box if the bitmap is found (not needed)<br>
Mouse(x, y, 0, 0, True); //left clicks the bitmap<br>
end else //if it doesnt find the bitmap<br>
begin<br>
Writeln(‘Sorry, it didn’t find the bitmap, terminating script.’); //types a message if it didnt find the bitmap(not needed)<br>
Terminatescript;  //terminates the script<br>
end;<br>
FreeBitmap(ChopDown) //frees the bitmap to prevent lag after the bitmap is used once<br>
end;</p>
<p>begin //main loop (this puts the procedures we made into use)<br>
SetupSRL; //required to have if your using srl functions<br>
LoadBitmaps; //put this in your main loop so it will load the bitmap<br>
FindTheTree; //this will find the tree using the procedure we made<br>
ChopDownTheTree;  //this will chop down the tree using the procedure we made<br>
end.[/code]<br>
The bitmap(s) you use must always be put in as variable(s) at the top.<br>
This little script finds the tree and right clicks is.<br>
Then it looks for the bitmap we made, left clicks that, and types in a message saying we found it.<br>
Then we use FreeBitmap to prevent lag(use this for all bitmaps you use after they are used in the script)<br>
This script isn’t made to be used, its just an example of how a bitmap would be used and how some of the script functions work.</p>
<p>Bitmaps can be used for much more than this, but the picture you make a bitmap of must always be exact because bitmaps look for specific pixels in an exact order.  I have listed some other ways to find a bitmap below though, and they are more reliable.</p>
<p>I use bitmaps all I can because they are so easy to make and work every time.</p>
<p>I hope this helped everyone who didn’t completely understand how to make and use bitmaps.</p>
<p>Also some useful tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can fill in parts of the picture you dont want scar to look for by making them black.</li>
<li>Bitmaps are great for finding symbols on the minimap in runescape</li>
<li>Finding items in your inventory if you dont know how to make DTMs</li>
<li>They are great for other games other than runescape</li>
<li>Much, much more.<img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is much more information about how bitmaps are used in the SRL manual <a data-bbcode="true">HERE</a>(on the right side of the page, it’s called SRL Manual.rar).  In this manual are all the srl functions, but they are ver yconfusing if you dont know scar very well.</p>
<p>I hope this has helped you make and use bitmaps for scripts you make in the future.</p>
<p>And if you have any problems, feel free to send me a private message or post here.  If there were any steps that could use more information, please tell me and I wll be glad to improve it.  Im here to help and i will always be glad to help.  I hope this has helped everyone learn more about bitmaps.</p>
