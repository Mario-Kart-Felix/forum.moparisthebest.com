    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparisthebest-com-my-views-and-my-ideas-for-this-forum/13340</link>
    <description>Well, first and foremost, I love this forum. I have never felt more happier with being at a forum. The forum is great, but I still have opinions on certain matters that have been eating away at me for a long time. 

[b][u]My Views[/u][/b]

Moparisthebest.com has been around for about half a year now. Maybe more. Already, there is over 16,000 members! That is amazing. I doubt many other forums can get 16,000 members in half a year without it being run almost to perfection. Although, there is no such thing as a perfect forum. I&#39;m afraid I will have to touch on some subjects that I do have a small problem about. It&#39;s nothing personal to anyone, it is just my opinion.

[b][u]Leechers[/u][/b]

Ok, I know 100% we are not an Anti-Leech community. Don&#39;t get me wrong, helping people who know less then you and seeing their reply when they are helped with fixing a Moparscape errror is rewarding, but to see well over 5,000 people who havent even taken the time to post ONCE, kind of makes me think about the way people treat communities. If they owned a forum with something no other forum offers, they would like it if the gave feedback, advice or even took the time to make one single post. The Moparscape download varies from 1 minute +. Making a post varies from 10 seconds+. What stopped them making a post?

Again, I&#39;d like to point out, I am not against leechers. Heck, I used to be one. But at least I took the time to make a half decent post. I hate to say this, but the majority of this forum ARE leechers. Of course, there are more than 4,000 active members. Most of whom are nice, genuine people. The rest, barely active. Maybe vists once or twice to check for an update. 

The way Mopar could combat this would be to have a clear out. Randomly delete 500 - 1,000 people monthly, who have 0 posts. The people who have made a post, wether it be one single one 2 months ago, should stay. They took the time to make a post, they should be allowed to stay. But for those who have 0 posts, get rid of them. I understand that the member count would be halved. Maybe more. But at least we know we have an Semi-active community. 

Another way Mopar could make this a more active community is to make it so you have to post at least once to be able to download ANYTHING from www.moparisthebest.com and www.moparisthebest.org. This would entice more people to come back. 

[b][u]Rule Enforcement[/u][/b]

Sure, lienence in the rules can be a good thing. In this community, designed from breaking rules, a bit of leeway wouldn&#39;t harm. But sometimes the Moderation team and the Administration team let people get away with murder. I am in no way saying they do not do their job. They do a wonderful job round this forum. We wouldn&#39;t be anywhere without them. 

Rarely, I have seen racial comments, speaking about rep constantly, flaming, spamming, disrespectiing other peoples views and a few more, without a simple warning. It annoys me when I see a MINIORITY of people, sometimes community members, purposly breaking the rules.

A way this can be improved is to clearly speak to the moderation team about what is and is not exceptable. For example, telling them that Racial comments should have a clear warning against it. Purposly breaking the rules should, again, result in a formal warning. 

It is not that the moderation team cannot do their job. They can very well, and I am happy with every single moderator at the moment. After you de-modded 5 moderators, the democracy was once again pure in this community. With the introduction of a new moderator, the rules will be enforced again. I think that the rules need to be re-written and made clear what the rules are and which rules can certainly not be broken.

Thanks for reading and sorry for making it so long. Comments are welcome as always :)</description>

They have to agree to the rules, but that idea is intriguing, I could probably pull that off, with the next version of smf that is <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

The only thing I do not agree with is the pruning of the leeches, at least they took 5 minutes to register an account, they even bothered to check thier emails.  I was a first time poster for about a month on kaitnieks, before I became active.  And I dont see how the 0 posters are even bothering anyone? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p>I appreciate everyone’s opinion, I’m always glad to hear suggestions from everyone, and although your opinions usually sway me one way or the other, whether or not they will go into effect however is in the end up to me.</p>
<p>You don’t have to register to download moparscape by the way.</p>

<p>He’s not TRYING to be a Mod, he’s just doing what a real member of the community would do: contribute and try to make it better for everyone.</p>
<p>And no, it’s not a dictatorship here, as long as people don’t break the rules (they’re not out of reason either), then they have the right to a voice.</p>
<p>Also, unless I’m wrong, telling someone to “Just stfu, no one cares what you think.” goes under the title of Flaming. He has the right to say what he thinks; whether you agree or not doesn’t mean he should automatically shut up.</p>
<p>To Mr. Chris:</p>
<p>Those are some good views, and I mostly agree with them, but I’d have to say that pruning the leeches would have to be extremely controlled. If someone made an account, then for some reason was inactive for 2 weeks+ (maybe a vacation, family stuff, etc.), coming back to see their account was deleted would give a little “bad vibe” from the site. At the same time, I think that pruning should happen…just less often. I think 6 months would be a good time. Almost no one goes on a vacation, or has other things to do, for that long. If they weren’t active after then, then it probably means they are not willing to come back. I don’t mean to clean out all 0-posters at that time; I mean to clean out members with less than 10 posts that have NOT been active AT ALL for 6 months.</p>
<p>Anyways, good thoughts.</p>

<p>We should have another rule, it is mandatory to read a sticky if you step into a particular catergory of the forum and post, at least even if they are noobs or leechers they won’t annoy us much with stupid questions.</p>

Don’t get me wrong, helping people who know less then you and seeing their reply when they are helped with fixing a Moparscape errror is rewarding, but to see well over 5,000 people who havent even taken the time to post ONCE, kind of makes me think about the way people treat communities. If they owned a forum with something no other forum offers, they would like it if the gave feedback, advice or even took the time to make one single post. The Moparscape download varies from 1 minute +. Making a post varies from 10 seconds+. What stopped them making a post?”</p>
<p>Not only not posting, but when they do the question has already been answered 5+ times.  Now, answering it more than once is bad.</p>

<p>I do agree with that. They did take the time to register but they didn’t take the time to even thank you. Does not bother you in the slightest. I know your a genuinly nice guy Mopar, but I nice thank you would be nice. Maybe not from everyone, but maybe from 5,000 out of the 9,000 who havent posted would be good.</p>
<p>The clear out would just be a nice way to make the forum FULL of active members. Therefore, you could officially say “90% of all members on my forum are active!”</p>
<p>As I said before, I was a leecher. I’m not a ‘Lazi’ (My new word which means against leechers :P), but I just think it would be a good thing, in every way, to make this forum full of 6,000 active members. Sure, the member count goes down, but that shouldn’t matter at all.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read and respond everyone. Especially Mopar for giving me something to discuss with you ;).</p>
<p>Thanks again <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>The only thing I do not agree with is the pruning of the leeches, at least they took 5 minutes to register an account, they even bothered to check thier emails.  I was a first time poster for about a month on kaitnieks, before I became active.  And I dont see how the 0 posters are even bothering anyone? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Wow, I agree 100% with all of your views. Thank you for writing this and saving me the hassle <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I also like the idea of “clearing out” the leechers who don’t post, I think we can have leechers but it is just insane to have that many that don’t even post once to give gratitude to the people who make this community worth being part of.</p>

              <p>Well, first and foremost, I love this forum. I have never felt more happier with being at a forum. The forum is great, but I still have opinions on certain matters that have been eating away at me for a long time.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">My Views</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> has been around for about half a year now. Maybe more. Already, there is over 16,000 members! That is amazing. I doubt many other forums can get 16,000 members in half a year without it being run almost to perfection. Although, there is no such thing as a perfect forum. I’m afraid I will have to touch on some subjects that I do have a small problem about. It’s nothing personal to anyone, it is just my opinion.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Leechers</span></span></p>
<p>Ok, I know 100% we are not an Anti-Leech community. Don’t get me wrong, helping people who know less then you and seeing their reply when they are helped with fixing a Moparscape errror is rewarding, but to see well over 5,000 people who havent even taken the time to post ONCE, kind of makes me think about the way people treat communities. If they owned a forum with something no other forum offers, they would like it if the gave feedback, advice or even took the time to make one single post. The Moparscape download varies from 1 minute +. Making a post varies from 10 seconds+. What stopped them making a post?</p>
<p>Again, I’d like to point out, I am not against leechers. Heck, I used to be one. But at least I took the time to make a half decent post. I hate to say this, but the majority of this forum ARE leechers. Of course, there are more than 4,000 active members. Most of whom are nice, genuine people. The rest, barely active. Maybe vists once or twice to check for an update.</p>
<p>The way Mopar could combat this would be to have a clear out. Randomly delete 500 - 1,000 people monthly, who have 0 posts. The people who have made a post, wether it be one single one 2 months ago, should stay. They took the time to make a post, they should be allowed to stay. But for those who have 0 posts, get rid of them. I understand that the member count would be halved. Maybe more. But at least we know we have an Semi-active community.</p>
<p>Another way Mopar could make this a more active community is to make it so you have to post at least once to be able to download ANYTHING from <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> and <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.org" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.org</a>. This would entice more people to come back.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Rule Enforcement</span></span></p>
<p>Sure, lienence in the rules can be a good thing. In this community, designed from breaking rules, a bit of leeway wouldn’t harm. But sometimes the Moderation team and the Administration team let people get away with murder. I am in no way saying they do not do their job. They do a wonderful job round this forum. We wouldn’t be anywhere without them.</p>
<p>Rarely, I have seen racial comments, speaking about rep constantly, flaming, spamming, disrespectiing other peoples views and a few more, without a simple warning. It annoys me when I see a MINIORITY of people, sometimes community members, purposly breaking the rules.</p>
<p>A way this can be improved is to clearly speak to the moderation team about what is and is not exceptable. For example, telling them that Racial comments should have a clear warning against it. Purposly breaking the rules should, again, result in a formal warning.</p>
<p>It is not that the moderation team cannot do their job. They can very well, and I am happy with every single moderator at the moment. After you de-modded 5 moderators, the democracy was once again pure in this community. With the introduction of a new moderator, the rules will be enforced again. I think that the rules need to be re-written and made clear what the rules are and which rules can certainly not be broken.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and sorry for making it so long. Comments are welcome as always <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
