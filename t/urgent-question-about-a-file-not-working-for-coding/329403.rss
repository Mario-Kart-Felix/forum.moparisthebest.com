    <title>Urgent Question about a file not working for coding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/urgent-question-about-a-file-not-working-for-coding/329403</link>
    <description>I&#39;m new to making servers, so I get the source from someone and tend to learn to add and/or remove things by going through what someone else has already made..

However in most downloaded sources, you go into the notepad file usually written as &quot;Client&quot; to do your editing, and every single source I have tried doesn&#39;t have one, it only has two icons with the icon images as a blank sheet of paper instead of the icon image being a notepad, these two are called &quot;client.class&quot; &amp; &quot;client.java&quot; - both of which, when I double click them, only open up the screen that says: 

&quot;Widows cannot open this file: [client.class/client.java] - To open this file, windows needs to know what program you want to use to open it. Windows can go online to look it up automatically, or you can manually select from a list of programs that are installed on your computer. What do you want to do? - Use the web service to find the correct program? -OR- Select a program from a list of installed programs?&quot;

It always had the right notepad icon for when I had windows XP and opened fine - But since getting Windows Vista it won&#39;t work.

Is it Windows Vista that is the problem with the opening of the &quot;Client&quot; file? or something else entirely? 

Please reply as soon as possible, as I would love to get underway with more learning on how to code.</description>
