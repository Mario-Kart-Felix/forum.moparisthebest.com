    <description>Ok so I have had my server turned on before and for awhile I didn&#39;t turn it on so today I thought why not let some players go on it so I loaded up my no-ip and it said I need to update it so I deleted that and added a new one. I went to my client.java and added the new one. I then opened up my source and ran it and then my no-ip (I already portforward+allowed a connection through my firewall) and when I went to check to see if it was online using &quot;Canyouseeme.org&quot; it said I was offline so I checked everything I did to turn it on and it still says the same thing and I can&#39;t figure out why. Here are the steps I am using [youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIqEOjX-GJQ[/youtube] and it worked before and now I don&#39;t understand why it is acting up like this :( Can someone please please help me I really wanna host my server again. (Reason I am not giving you details about the server is because it doesn&#39;t have anything affecting it besides not allowing a connection from one thing to another but if I must then I will edit the post and tell you the detail bout it)</description>
