<p>Yes, the fact still stand. If God put animals down that are similar to their parents the animals would be based on the earlier forms of their parents, they have evolved. The idea that God put them on the planet would go under the theory of evolution.[/quote]</p>

<p>No, God simply places the animal on the earth, not in its mother’s womb.  Would that be evolution?</p>
<p>We would say that’s unlikely, and point to the scientific evidence against it.</p>

<p>Proberly not. I’m not sure, but how would that work? Everything is born, it doesn’t just appear - that can be proven <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Why, then, is the idea that God is eternal never questioned by religous folks, why do they never look at the scientific evidence against it? The mind boggles at the idea.</p>
<p>Zoroastrianism/Hinduism was before the time that Abraham came to be, apparently - feel free to prove me wrong, I do remember that the Vedic period started somewhere in 1800BC and continued up to 6th centuary BCE, Hinduism is quite hevily based on the vedic civilisation and was founded by them at sometime.</p>

        <p>You are looking beyond the picture. First of all, last time I checked, BC meant Before Christ. I know our Calender is a few years off, but Christianity was started when Christ, as a human, was around thirty years old (so roughly 33 AD I believe.) The Bible itself is the only recorded history before 2000 BC, unless I am wrong. It has the entire time line of the earth itself since creation to around 100 AD. Yes, the Bible was written around 1400 BC, but it cannot have made up history. There are no errors in the Bible, not a single one.</p>
<p>Another point, is it so very hard to believe that “Hey! God created us by means of science!”? Do you think that the exquisite, unbelievably complex system of DNA, cells, atoms, compounds, etc all came from mere <span class="bbcode-i">chance</span>? People use science to create technology to make our lives easier. But people use science to prove that God does not exist, when the big picture clearly shows that God truly made science and everything else.</p>
<p>As xxlegitxx said, God is eternal or immortal. He has been here forever and will be here forever. Our simple minds (yet so complex) cannot comprehend one inch of God. Because of this, we chose to <span class="bbcode-i">ignore</span> (my purpose of using ignorant) God’s love for us and make up excuses which usually lead to science.</p>
<p>Now I am just repeating myself, but that is my fact. I can carry on this debate for a very long time, but how much science do you have to feed it?</p>

        <p>[quote=“Taharok, post:126, topic:138649”]You are looking beyond the picture. First of all, last time I checked, BC meant Before Christ. I know our Calender is a few years off, but Christianity was started when Christ, as a human, was around thirty years old (so roughly 33 AD I believe.) The Bible itself is the only recorded history before 2000 BC, unless I am wrong. It has the entire time line of the earth itself since creation to around 100 AD. Yes, the Bible was written around 1400 BC, but it cannot have made up history. There are no errors in the Bible, not a single one.</p>
<p>Another point, is it so very hard to believe that “Hey! God created us by means of science!”? Do you think that the exquisite, unbelievably complex system of DNA, cells, atoms, compounds, etc all came from mere <span class="bbcode-i">chance</span>? People use science to create technology to make our lives easier. But people use science to prove that God does not exist, when the big picture clearly shows that God truly made science and everything else.</p>
<p>As xxlegitxx said, God is eternal or immortal. He has been here forever and will be here forever. Our simple minds (yet so complex) cannot comprehend one inch of God. Because of this, we chose to <span class="bbcode-i">ignore</span> (my purpose of using ignorant) God’s love for us and make up excuses which usually lead to science.</p>
<p>Now I am just repeating myself, but that is my fact. I can carry on this debate for a very long time, but how much science do you have to feed it?[/quote]</p>
<p>Recorded history? The Bible is not a historical work, it has no literal meanings. There is no proof there was ever a Garden of Eden, there was no proof there was ever a great flood/Noah’s Ark, there is no proof that there was ever any of it. Vedic Sanskrit’s are older then The Bible. How can a book have <em>no</em> errors? The Bible has lots of errors, here’s a few contradictions - which can be considered errors:</p>
<blockquote>EXO 15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.
<p>ROM 15:33 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>JOH 10:30 I and my Father are one.
<p>JOH 14:28 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>ISA 14:21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.
<p>DEU 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you mean by “exquisite, unbelievably complex system of DNA, cells, atoms, compounds, etc all came from mere chance?”? Chance?</p>
<p>God can not exist! He is all powerfull, the greatest handicap is to create something whilst not existing, thus, he does not exist. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>The Bible has historical significance.  There is evidence of a great flood.  And of course there would be no proof of something that was hidden from human eyes.</p>
<p>God is multifaceted.  Why must he either be the God of peace or the God of war?</p>
<p>That’s the matter of the Trinity.  Which I suggest you research a bit more before you suggest it is an error.</p>
<p>I don’t know Isaiah enough to provide a defense for that.  But I assure you the Bible does not self-contradict.</p>
<p>I agree it is highly likely for some intelligent beings to exist by ‘chance’ in such a large universe.  Chance would actually dictate the fact that it is more likely for intelligent beings to form than not.</p>
<p>That line didn’t make much sense…</p>
<p>The existence of birth does not disprove the hypothesis that new species could be simply placed down by God.</p>
<p>Why must God adhere to natural laws?</p>
<p>Says who?</p>
