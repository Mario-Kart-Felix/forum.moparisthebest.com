Recorded history? The Bible is not a historical work, it has no literal meanings. There is no proof there was ever a Garden of Eden, there was no proof there was ever a great flood/Noah’s Ark, there is no proof that there was ever any of it. Vedic Sanskrit’s are older then The Bible. How can a book have <em>no</em> errors? The Bible has lots of errors, here’s a few contradictions - which can be considered errors:</p>
<p>[quote]EXO 15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.</p>
<p>ROM 15:33 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote]JOH 10:30 I and my Father are one.</p>
<p>JOH 14:28 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote]ISA 14:21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.</p>
<p>DEU 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.[/quote]</p>
<p>What do you mean by “exquisite, unbelievably complex system of DNA, cells, atoms, compounds, etc all came from mere chance?”? Chance?</p>
<p>God can not exist! He is all powerfull, the greatest handicap is to create something whilst not existing, thus, he does not exist. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>The fact that birth is a well-documented [b]fact[b].</p>
<p>The fact that “God” does not adhere to any natural laws.</p>
<p>No religion was based on this until later.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>The Bible has historical significance.  There is evidence of a great flood.  And of course there would be no proof of something that was hidden from human eyes.</p>
<p>God is multifaceted.  Why must he either be the God of peace or the God of war?</p>
<p>That’s the matter of the Trinity.  Which I suggest you research a bit more before you suggest it is an error.</p>
<p>I don’t know Isaiah enough to provide a defense for that.  But I assure you the Bible does not self-contradict.</p>
<p>I agree it is highly likely for some intelligent beings to exist by ‘chance’ in such a large universe.  Chance would actually dictate the fact that it is more likely for intelligent beings to form than not.</p>
<p>That line didn’t make much sense…</p>
<p>The existence of birth does not disprove the hypothesis that new species could be simply placed down by God.</p>
<p>Why must God adhere to natural laws?</p>
<p>Says who?</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>What I meant was, why hasn’t it been moved. Most of the pages are filled with debating.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Why should it be moved?  Is it a flame war?  Is it spam?  No.[/quote]</p>
<p>There is evidence of floods occuring in the past, but there is no evidence to suggest that it occured in such epic proportions as described in The Bible. If something is hidden from human eyes then it is considered blind believe, and, as I said right at the start of the discussion, it is not based on any facts.</p>
<p>It is an error. God contradicts himself, how can a God who “loves” peace, also “love” war?</p>
<p>I don’t think that’s what he was meaning when he said “chance”, I think he was talking about evolution being, ‘by chance’.</p>
<p>What I was meaning was; God is omnipotent(all powerful), the “power” of something is measured on the handicap of the thing, and it’s acheivements. The creation of the Universe is the greatest acheivement ever. The greatest handicap possible is non-existence. Thus, for God to be omnipotent, he cannot exist. So, he either does not exist, or he not all powerful - if he is not all powerful, then this is a huge error in The Bible.</p>
<p>Yes it does. It can be observed, things do not appear out of nowhere, that is fact.</p>
<p>All things have to adhere to them.</p>
<p>Find me a religion that was based on Abraham in 2000BC.</p>

        <p>He does not contradict him self. He is a God of love, not of peace. When his disciples/followers disobey his commands, he punishes them. One means of punishment in the Old Testament was to have other armies defeat and enslave the Israelites (his chosen people) so that they would learn to fear and trust in him with their hearts. However, every time they called out to God for help, he always had a way to save them. Read through Judges and you will know what I am talking about.</p>
<p>Religion is based upon facts. There is proof all around us. The bones of Jesus’ disciples are still here (if they haven’t fully decayed in the last 2000 years) and even his cross and tomb still exist. Jerusalem DOES exist. Egypt DOES exist. How can you continue to say that God does not exist when a huge part of our lives revolve around him. Like I said, the AD and BC was not pulled out of some dude’s ass you know. God did create this planet and The Bible is true.</p>
<p>And who says the flood did not exist? Look at the Grand Canyon. I highly doubt that the whole “millions of years of erosion” could create something so beautiful as that.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Taharok, post:143, topic:138649”]He does not contradict him self. He is a God of love, not of peace. When his disciples/followers disobey his commands, he punishes them. One means of punishment in the Old Testament was to have other armies defeat and enslave the Israelites (his chosen people) so that they would learn to fear and trust in him with their hearts. However, every time they called out to God for help, he always had a way to save them. Read through Judges and you will know what I am talking about.</p>
<p>Religion is based upon facts. There is proof all around us. The bones of Jesus’ disciples are still here (if they haven’t fully decayed in the last 2000 years) and even his cross and tomb still exist. Jerusalem DOES exist. Egypt DOES exist. How can you continue to say that God does not exist when a huge part of our lives revolve around him. Like I said, the AD and BC was not pulled out of some dude’s ass you know. God did create this planet and The Bible is true.</p>
<p>And who says the flood did not exist? Look at the Grand Canyon. I highly doubt that the whole “millions of years of erosion” could create something so beautiful as that.[/quote]</p>
<p>“ROM 15:33 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.”, he’s not a God of peace? Why would a God of Love punish his followers when they disobey? A truly benevolent God would not punish them.</p>
<p>The fact that a few people existed who said they were is contact with God proves nothing. A person in the modern age who said they heard voices telling them to make a religion would mostly be considered insane, these people were simply not considered insane in the day because of a lack of knowledge in the area of psychology - and sadly, the religious folk are so strongly ingrained in society now that when you hear voices, you can claim it is God and avoid being branded as insane. BC can be substituted with BCE - BCE means Before Common Era. CE is also interchangeable with AD. The fact that the words BC and AD exists is not proof of <em>anything</em>. Why are you reffering to these as facts? They arn’t.</p>
<p>It’s highly possible. Just because something is “beautiful” or “complex” doesn’t mean it needed to have a divine force behind its creation. I sense a human eye retort coming up.</p>
<p>Consider the fact that there are 1000’s of religion in the world today, every single one of them claims to be the correct one. All of them preach different teachings - even the abrahamic religions(islam, christianity, judaism) are hugely different. All of them claim the others are incorrect. All of them have <span class="bbcode-b">no</span> proof other than their respective holy books. Convenient?</p>
<p>Can you answer these two questions/statements for me:</p>
<p>Why would a God who is omniscient and benevolent create a world, where he knew we would sin. Why would he create this world if he knew that we would sin, and thus, go to Hell? A God with true love would do everything to stop suffering even beginning. A God who is truly omniscient or benevolent would never of created the world.</p>
<p>God is omnipotent(all powerful), the “power” of something is measured on the handicap of the thing, and it’s acheivements. The creation of the Universe is the greatest acheivement ever. The greatest handicap possible is non-existence. Thus, for God to be omnipotent, he cannot exist. So, he either does not exist, or he not all powerful - if he is not all powerful, then this is a huge error in The Bible.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more: Humans were made in God’s image, if God is omnipotent(perfect) how can we be imperfect? Something that is made from something that is without flaw cannot have flaws.</p>

        <p>I was at this Christian camp this summer called PitStop, this is not like a “bible camp” church thing, this is more like a couple of Christian youth clubs around Norway met together.</p>
<p>Anyways to the point: Many people are controlled by the fact that they only believe in science and proof and forgets all about faith.</p>
<p>Things you can’t explain with science that happened on this camp is: This girl in the camp had just damaged her leg pretty hard and the doctor said it would heal in 2 months or so. People prayed for her and she could walk out of the place without her crutches and no pain. I also saw my close friend which hadn’t been close to his religion in years get struck down in the floor and burst out crying after being prayed for. When I got prayed for by a bunch of friends I felt something that struck my heart at once and I started feeling really cold and warm at the same time as I almost went in the floor.</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain, but this was my try.</p>
<p>You can believe me or not, it’s your choice, as well as believing in Jesus Christ is your choice.</p>
<p>This is me speaking from experience, it might not sound logical, but not everything has to.</p>

<p>Of course this could be the case, but I do not believe it was. I felt something that day, and I’m sure most of the people there did too, consider many of those there, were not really open to Christ. Many of them changed that day because they felt something (Me included). I have always believed in God and Jesus Christ as his son, but I have never really taken anything into consideration, but after what I seen, I can’t ignore it. I might not be good at following the Bible step by step, but that’s not all that there is. Faith is the thing that holds it all together.</p>
<p>I understand if it’s hard to follow, but this is from my heart.</p>

<p>Of course this could be the case, but I do not believe it was. I felt something that day, and I’m sure most of the people there did too, consider many of those there, were not really open to Christ. Many of them changed that day because they felt something (Me included). I have always believed in God and Jesus Christ as his son, but I have never really taken anything into consideration, but after what I seen, I can’t ignore it.</p>

<p>You already believed in god before you went to this camp. You said so yourself. You, and everyone else at that camp, went there for a reason: they believed, our believed with doubt, that god is real. So you/them were open to it, and then you are easily persuaded into actually believing that. It’s the same as young children: they are open to everything elders tell them. If a grandfather tells a ghost story to a 8 year old, the kid gets scared. A 16 year old isn’t that open to those tales, so he won’t be scared. This is how most people become Christian: they see their parents as a big authority and because their parents raise them as Christians, they become Christian too.</p>
<p>Someone that thinks there is a god, but needs evidence to really believe it, might connect feelings with god and thinks he has found his evidence. If I went to such a camp, I doubt I would feel anything. If I did feel something, I would file those feelings under regular emotion, just as music can touch you.</p>
<p>Some people put other members of society above themselves. They see them as wise, and agree with them. Through history some have achieved to have a whole nation of followers. Hitler is one of them. Others had a smaller group of followers, like Jim Jones. Their followers were searching for answers, and charismatic people have a big influence on them. Pastors are the same, but usually the results of their speeches isn’t that dramatic.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is, that you and others relate things with each other, while there is no relation between those two things. You misplace emotions.And you see some people as an authority, while they are not.

When his disciples/followers disobey his commands, he punishes them. One means of punishment in the Old Testament was to have other armies defeat and enslave the Israelites (his chosen people) so that they would learn to fear and trust in him with their hearts. However, every time they called out to God for help, he always had a way to save them. Read through Judges and you will know what I am talking about.[/quote]</p>
<p>Love through fear. That’s quite degrading. I believe it was a frequently used strategy in many medieval civilications. The people are stupid, but they have to love their ruler. By scaring the crap out of the people, they see their leader as a loving person?</p>
<p>I’ve never seen a raped girl love her rapist.</p>

<p>Religion is based upon facts. There is proof all around us. The bones of Jesus’ disciples are still here (if they haven’t fully decayed in the last 2000 years) and even his cross and tomb still exist. Jerusalem DOES exist. Egypt DOES exist. How can you continue to say that God does not exist when a huge part of our lives revolve around him. Like I said, the AD and BC was not pulled out of some dude’s ass you know. God did create this planet and The Bible is true.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The fact that Jerusalem exists doesn’t mean shit. The only thing it proves is that the city exists for over 2000 years. The mountain Olympus exists too, but that doesn’t mean Ares exists. AD and BC were ‘invented’ in the year 525.  And, if you believe that Jesus existed, it’s one year off. Jesus was born in 1AD, not 0.</p>

<p>And who says the flood did not exist? Look at the Grand Canyon. I highly doubt that the whole “millions of years of erosion” could create something so beautiful as that.</p>

<p>Beauty is relative to the person. Some find ‘Dora Maar au Chat’ by Picasso an ugly piece of shit. But it is one of the most expensive paintings nowadays. And I don’t see a link between the Grand Canyon and a flood.</p>
