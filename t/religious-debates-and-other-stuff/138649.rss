    <description>I think we should ban them. Every religious topic here brings with it conflict and tension. 


EDIT: Also has anyone noticed the high amount of flame we have here? It&#39;s crazy shizzle!</description>

<p>natural selection acts on the level of the gene, not on the individual.<br>
you might want to read <span class="bbcode-i">The Selfish Gene</span> by Richard Dawkins, which clearly explains why selfish genes produces altruistic, co-operative, <span class="bbcode-i">nice</span> humans.</p>

<p>You claim that god created every animal in it’s perfect form. But are we perfect? Were the Neanderthalers perfect? Were dinosaurs perfect? If they were, where are they now? They weren’t perfect, because they couldn’t adapt. Once again I will use this example: Humans in the dark ages weren’t as tall as we are today. Why? The food we eat today is better, health care is better, our life is better. This allows us to become taller. This is an example of evolution. We adapted to our situation. Evolution does exist!</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/yakman">@yakman</a>: You’ll probably want a Christian to respond, but I agree. If you are benevolent, you won’t apply the rule of survival of the fittest. The Nazi’s believed that the Aryan race was the fittest, and only the Aryan race should survive. They weren’t what you would call benevolent.</p>

<p>If you read Genesis, you’ll read the claim that god created humans. Evolution ‘tells’ us that humans weren’t the first animals. If god is almighty, he would’ve created animals in their final stage, ie perfect. If you make something, you’ll want it to be perfect. Besides that, god supposedly created us as an image of himself. If you look at fossils, you’ll see that there have been previous forms of humans and other animals. This means that those animals weren’t perfect.[/quote]<br>

<p>If so, then point 3 of my post is the one Christians follow. If I read a scientific magazine, and the first article is filled with false information, I cancel my subscription and throw it away. If the first, and usually most eye catching article is false, why should I believe the rest isn’t?</p>
<p>As soon as the net of negative evidence closes itself around a biblical story, Christians file it under metaphorical. Back in the day when Darwin published his book, many were against it and wanted it to be banned. They took Genesis literally. But now the evidence in favor of evolution has piled up, Genesis is suddenly metaphorical and evolution is accepted by a big group of Christians.</p>
<p>The only source that states that Jesus is the son of god, is the bible. If the bible is completely metaphorical, then why believe that Jesus existed?</p>
<p>EDIT: Shouldn’t this be moved to Discussions and Debates? This thread is drastically derailed.</p>

Evolution is a system that causes much pain and suffering in the world.</p>
<p>For something as simple as slightly darker skin to evolve, thousands upon thousands of creatures must die through no fault of their own.<br>
For something as complicated as present-day humans to evolve, billions upon billions of organisms must die because they were unlucky enough to be born with the wrong genes.</p>

</aside>
<p>If you read Genesis, you’ll read the claim that god created humans. Evolution ‘tells’ us that humans weren’t the first animals. If god is almighty, he would’ve created animals in their final stage, ie perfect. If you make something, you’ll want it to be perfect. Besides that, god supposedly created us as an image of himself. If you look at fossils, you’ll see that there have been previous forms of humans and other animals. This means that those animals weren’t perfect.</p>
<p>So either:</p>
<ol>
<li>God didn’t create us.</li>
<li>He isn’t almighty.</li>
<li>The first story in the bible is a false one. Which makes me doubt the value of the rest of the bible.</li>
<li>God doesn’t exist.</li>
</ol>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/haticks">@haticks</a>. Evolution doesn’t work that way. You, giraffes, and any other animal can’t change it’s internal workings. If a giraffe would come across a situation like you described, and somehow survived, it would keep on getting in that situation. It can’t just put that sponge in it’s head. For some reason they developed that sponge, spread over the generations.</p>

I’d like the name of this former “evolutionist” (is he a qualified scientist, or is he a kent hovind?)</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure the rest of what you have said is basically a misunderstanding of the fundamentals of evolution, or the underlying “mechanism” if you will, natural selection, which is what lawl basically mentioned.[/quote]He was some professor, not sure on the name but I can find out tomorrow when I have that class.</p>

I go to a private christian school, and during the last too bible classes we watched a film about a college professor who used to be an evolutionist, but a few students pointed out flaws in the theory of evolution that made him start questioning it.</p>
<p>In the movie he takes like 15 animals or so and shows things they MUST have to survive, or they’ll die. The theory of evolution says "evolution is change in the genetic material of a population of organisms from one generation to the next " (Ima pull a yakman, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution</a>) He says if __ animal didn’t have ___ feature it would die. And a dead animal can’t adapt, or evolve, to keep it’s self from dying. That description was lame, so ill try and post as much as I can from one of his examples…</p>
<p>One of the examples he used was a giraffe. A giraffe has a huge heart, which pumps at around 3x (IIRC) than a human. Reason for this is too get the blood up its long neck. When the giraffe goes to get a drink, it bends its head down to the water, and gets it. Now lets say its getting a drink, and then it sees a lion out of the corner of its eye. Its going to bring its head up, fast, and run away. Only problem is, it passes out because all the blood rushed too his head. (<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,363580.msg2901205.html#msg2901205" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,363580.msg2901205.html#msg2901205</a> basically that.) Now the lion that is lying on the ground un concious getting eaten by a lion, isn’t going to adapt, or evolve to fix the problem of blood rushing too its head, because its dead.  But it doesn’t have too, because the giraffe has a sponge like thing next to its brain, that absorbs the blood and keeps it from getting to much to the brain. It couldn’t have evolved to get this sponge, because it wouldn’t have known it needed too.</p>
<p>Theres several more examples that he used, but the majority of the animals had weird names that i don’t remember  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"><br>
Just throwin that out there…I thought the movie was pretty interesting.</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
this is a very common misunderstanding about evolution. an animal doesnt decide to evolve because it realized that it need to. things evolve through natural selection. that means that, one of the giraffes mutated and got some shit in its brain, and some of them didn’t. the ones that did get shit in their brain survived, the rest died. so all that you have remaining is ones with shit in their brain, and that gene keeps living on.[/quote]So basically it’s trial and error till something ends up working.</p>

theres no reason to believe in anything which has no evidence<br>
[/quote]Although I agree with you, I feel the need to say that most evidence is found through faith that something is a certain way, then finding ways to prove it.  So, your statement is false.</p>
<p>However, in the case of religion, they will never find any evidence no matter how faithful they are.[/quote]</p>
<p>I feel you’re talking about faith in evidence. For instance you need faith in your stopwatch that its telling you the right time, and you need faith in your eyes that they are telling you the right picture, and you need faith in your nerves that they transmit correctly.<br>
As I understand, you’re saying you need faith in evidence.</p>
<p>Thats all true, but the amount of faith is negligible, let me explain.</p>
<p>In all my 18 years, the sun has risen every day. Tomorrow the sun will either rise, or it wont. If you think about it, it takes <span class="bbcode-i">more faith</span> to believe the sun will not rise then to believe it will.</p>
<p>I feel faith is like friction and air resistance to an engineer, you can never get rid of it but you should do your best to reduce it to very low levels.</p>
<p>It is most rational to believe in that which requires the least amount of faith. A lack of belief in all Gods is the most rational position.</p>
<p>I’ll put it another way. I dont have faith in evidence, the second it stops working I will discard it and I invite all religious people to treat their belief in the same way.</p>

<p>This community is great and part of that has been fair moderation. Keep up the good work.</p>
<p>Now getting back on topic: The bible has been rewritten so many times that they just keep the bits they like. For example has homosexuality been normal a thousand years ago I would not be surprised if there was a holy commandment / metaphorical story / famous god-recognized that saint written about in the bible that had been ‘found’ all those years ago and then the real origin of the story quietly forgotten. Instead people are repulsed by homosexuality and teach their kids and others about their religion that sends homosexuals straight to hell. And so they put the fear of god into them so they follow the one true path and everyone is straight.</p>

<p>Why is the reason of the punishment only really discussed when people might be offended by it?</p>

<p>He just wrote that in his post to be funny I guess, because it would indeed be a bad moderation decision to moderate him for that post.[/quote]</p>
<p>He was actually moderated in that post, but it wasn’t for religious reasons. For months he has been breaking the rules,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,693.msg2913842.html#msg2913842" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,693.msg2913842.html#msg2913842</a> (he, or someone else deleted his post in the pic)<br>

<p>and that’s within the past 2 months. If he was really serious about that post, then I apologies but it looks like he’s <span class="bbcode-s">trolling</span> honestly trying to start a debate in the wrong thread in the wrong section.</p>
