    <description>OK Before you start reading my post and think &quot;Your just a leecher! Go somewhere else!&quot; I am not a leecher. I am in the process of a chicken killer, but I am only 12 so I can&#39;t do much scripts with school.

Also, I have searched and only found GoF&#39;s which won&#39;t work, Skys that only cuts that 1 tree to the north, and some sky&#39;s that someone edited that sucks.

I would prefer for this to use the SRL include, with anti-random events.

So if you have one this is done (or almost done) please upload it here and email it to me at hy71194@gmail.com.

Thank you  :)[br][size=1]Posted on: March 04, 2007, 09:12:19 AM[/size][hr]Hello? Is anyone there? :(</description>
