    <title>Please help to do with 317 stat bonuses</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-help-to-do-with-317-stat-bonuses/422218</link>
    <description>Alright well, i have 317 dodian based and the problem that i am about to say I&#39;ve never had before so in that case i have got no idea how to fix.. I have honestly attempted it and looked on Google but cannot find any help. So here is the problem....

At level 126 no armor no weaps on or anything but str bonus is +19, and other bonuses are +9.. but at level 3 combat my str bonus and all other bonuses are 0 so i believe they go up automatically to do with that stat level such as att\str\def, how would i fix this so no matter what level the combat is \att,str,def your bonuses are 0 with nothing on?

Please help.</description>
