    <description>Well for a good year now servers have been 99% identical, recently I&#39;ve seen a project that actually stand out as someone trying to make something unique. It is Cocoa&#39;s Nazi Zombies this is a fresh take on the tools provided and with some work its shaping up to be a nice project. Well this got me thinking, why not actually start making unique servers again, servers with a purpose not just pking in a different location or npcs placed at every possible interval. I&#39;m thinking to make a server that is more of a single player game, for offline play but it could be played online with other people. A game that has an actual story, and with a story comes a purpose its a great thing. Im thinking something like grand theft auto where you play through the story but you have that sandbox element. I&#39;m not sure whether I will do this I&#39;m just seeing if there is anyone interested in this sort of thing and whether or not they would want to help if i [i]did[/i] decide to do it. As is most likely I wouldn&#39;t do much writing of code, A-levels and other things prevent this. But I would be an active part of the project as much as my time allows. Anyone interested in this</description>

hence why im giving it a go, normally i know projects on this site go down the shitter and all servers are generic,bland and boring. The main reason is a lack of creativity and individuality so im going to try and add a proper story to this where players can feel like they are playing an almost different game in single player or with other users on a server it wont matter but the point will be to give users something to do instead of playing the same shit with a different name</p>

Well a few people have expressed interest in this and it could shape up to be a nice project so i’m going to setup a way of group communications anyone who’s interested in this pop your name down and i’ll set it up and message all the interested members</p>
