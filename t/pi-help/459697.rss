    <description>So im trying to host my server, but i recently changed sources because i wanted to do a PI instead of the 508 i was doing but i have some things on my client I dont know how to change, Such as The previous host put The name of his client in the chat box.I also cant figure out how to change it and i cant find where to change the source ip but i already changed it on the client... Best way to respond to me is Through skype :) add me: Clutch0008 if you can help me Thanks</description>
