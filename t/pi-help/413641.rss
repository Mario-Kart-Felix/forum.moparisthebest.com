    <description>So I start downloading my cache via my auto cache downloader and it downloads fine at like 1000KB/s. When I delete it later and test the auto cache downloader again, here&#39;s what happens about 15 mins after I start downloading it.

The cache is about 95MB, but the first time, it was really fast, so the cause is probably not the size of it. The first time, it downloaded at 1000KB/s, then, the second time, it downloaded at 28KB/s.</description>
