    <description>I need:

If there are players are fight, if someone trying to drop items and he is under attack, so he can&#39;t need to add this sentence if someone drop items under attack:

[b]You must be 10 seconds out of being in combat to drop items.[/b]

[hr]

And if you was fighting someone you must wait 10 secs to open ur bank, need it with this sentence: 

[b]You must be 10 seconds out of being to open your bank.[/b]</description>
