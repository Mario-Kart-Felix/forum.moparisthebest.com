    <description>I&#39;m desperate for this. I&#39;ve been looking everywhere and I&#39;ve had trouble with this for a week+. I&#39;ve tried multiple things but I can&#39;t get it resolved. My problem is when you die in my server you don&#39;t lose your items and the killer doesn&#39;t get your items. I believe the error is in PlayerAssistant.java and I&#39;ve messed with that a lot. I attempted to fix it but failed and made it so only Donors lose items when they die. 

Some extra information: In Ardougne PK you lose items but nowhere else. 
Please help, I&#39;m in need of this.</description>
