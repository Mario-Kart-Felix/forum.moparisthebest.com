    <description>[CENTER][img]http://i1087.photobucket.com/albums/j472/austincadle/image-3.jpg[/img][/CENTER]

Hey guys, My name is Austin Cadle, (no, I&#39;m not Aust1n, we are friends however on Skype and on here), Anyways, I used to code quite a bit back in 2011 when I was still learning. :3 I released Torvapkz about three days after summer started, using the base Final Judgement, and towards the end of the summer using the base Mezzy-Scape 562/659 I made Project Dungeonfest. Both of which both turned into huge successes, with the views and downloads at surprising levels. O.o But I&#39;m here to show you that I&#39;m not dead haha. :3 And show you that I&#39;ve actually learned quite a bit since my last release, and I will prove it over time, now that I&#39;m back, and  I want to state here, that after the project is finished, I will be releasing it! :3 

Alright so first, let me start off by saying that (call me crazy or dumb, doesn&#39;t bother me), but I honestly don&#39;t care about donations, and will refuse them, money is not the reason I code. I code because I want to give something back to the world that I can be proud of. And I hope everyone else enjoys the project, there will be Alpha, And Beta testing, aswell as the official server, over the time, I will complete this project, and that&#39;s a promise. I&#39;m not one to break promises. So without further a due, let&#39;s get into my first development topic in almost 3 years! ;D

FAQ:
What is the base used?:  Lost-Realm 718 (Shoutout to Santa Hat for a great base! :D) 

When was this base started? : January 2014. 

What is the Server Revision: 718/718

Why not 718/742? : That is what most of the remakes now-a-days are going for, and I personally don&#39;t like any of the new eoc models such as maps/npc&#39;s Etc. The purpose of this remake is to give the true experience of what RuneScape was like before eoc, there&#39;s no sense in making a remake, if it represents eoc, ya know? :3 

Will this be released after it&#39;s complete?: Yes, yes it will! I hope everyone enjoys it as well! :D 

Can I buy things In-game for RSGP/Paypal?: No, First of all I have no need for your money/RSGP, second of all, it&#39;s not fair to other players to have to work hard for their stuff, and some guy just donates so that he can skip that, it&#39;s just not right, and I believe in fairness. 

Will you have a legit account on the server? Yes, my username will be:  (1337 fury pk) and I will play 100% legit on this account, and will not xfer anything at all to it, including items,skills, exp rate boosts, etc. I will play fairly. 

Next, I will name every feature that we have ingame that you can look forward to if you decide to play when testing comes around! :D

<p>Hey guys, My name is Austin Cadle, (no, I’m not Aust1n, we are friends however on Skype and on here), Anyways, I used to code quite a bit back in 2011 when I was still learning. :3 I released Torvapkz about three days after summer started, using the base Final Judgement, and towards the end of the summer using the base Mezzy-Scape 562/659 I made Project Dungeonfest. Both of which both turned into huge successes, with the views and downloads at surprising levels. O.o But I’m here to show you that I’m not dead haha. :3 And show you that I’ve actually learned quite a bit since my last release, and I will prove it over time, now that I’m back, and  I want to state here, that after the project is finished, I will be releasing it! :3</p>
<p>Alright so first, let me start off by saying that (call me crazy or dumb, doesn’t bother me), but I honestly don’t care about donations, and will refuse them, money is not the reason I code. I code because I want to give something back to the world that I can be proud of. And I hope everyone else enjoys the project, there will be Alpha, And Beta testing, aswell as the official server, over the time, I will complete this project, and that’s a promise. I’m not one to break promises. So without further a due, let’s get into my first development topic in almost 3 years! ;D</p>
<p>FAQ:<br>
What is the base used?:  Lost-Realm 718 (Shoutout to Santa Hat for a great base! :D)</p>
<p>When was this base started? : January 2014.</p>
<p>What is the Server Revision: 718/718</p>
<p>Why not 718/742? : That is what most of the remakes now-a-days are going for, and I personally don’t like any of the new eoc models such as maps/npc’s Etc. The purpose of this remake is to give the true experience of what RuneScape was like before eoc, there’s no sense in making a remake, if it represents eoc, ya know? :3</p>
<p>Will this be released after it’s complete?: Yes, yes it will! I hope everyone enjoys it as well! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Can I buy things In-game for RSGP/Paypal?: No, First of all I have no need for your money/RSGP, second of all, it’s not fair to other players to have to work hard for their stuff, and some guy just donates so that he can skip that, it’s just not right, and I believe in fairness.</p>
<p>Will you have a legit account on the server? Yes, my username will be:  (1337 fury pk) and I will play 100% legit on this account, and will not xfer anything at all to it, including items,skills, exp rate boosts, etc. I will play fairly.</p>
<p>Next, I will name every feature that we have ingame that you can look forward to if you decide to play when testing comes around! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
