    <title>Suggestion: Please read to find out</title>

    <description>I have been registered for a few months and i am wondering if you all could update the site and add a few things, if possible. The following things i think we be helpful is: Areas that provide tutorials about java, c++, scar, web design. If you would add those categories, that would probably make people talk about your site better i am not saying that you have to add themi just think it would help.  :)

Thank you</description>

<p>For the last 3 links, if someone has a tutorial to post… they will post it there.</p>
<p>@ Your poll… Why would you want topics &gt;35 deleted in 10 days? That most likely means that the topic is active, a lot of important/unique/entertaining posts have a high count of posts.</p>
<p>Also I believe in archiving, to see progress… ie.</p>
<ul>
<li>io9 was a fat ass that generally just got picked on</li>
<li>he’s still a fat ass that probably still gets picked on, but he now shows java knowledge</li>
</ul>
