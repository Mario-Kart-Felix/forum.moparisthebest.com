To hell did I expect Stannis over the white walkers. That was more of a surprise than Tywin dying on the shitter. The hound had the best line in the whole season “Unless there’s a grand maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I’m done.” That had me rolling. He’s as much of a bad ass as anyone.</p>
<p>But anyhow - Valar Morghulis, until next time.</p>

              <p>I don’t think Jamie will need to come to his aid, the only reason he asked for Jamie last time was because no one would fight an imp half their size and so he was forced to ask for a champion. Everyone in kings landing will accept the challenge against Tyrion because he killed the king. The only thing I can see happening that will keep Tyrion alive is Tywin denying the request and sending him off to the wall as Jamie requested, but whether or not his request can be denied is the question.</p>
<p>As a side note, Daenerys is falling apart, she’s not fit to lead and she is starting to show it with the Dragons doing whatever they want and her impatience with attending to the people in need. Things are looking up for me, today was a good day.</p>

<p>EDIT: not much happened in this episode, just seemed like an episode made to fill in whats happening. Kind of like a travel scene, it’s just showing you the in-between of what has happened and what’s going to happen.</p>

Overall I feel as though this episode was meant for building suspense which it did pretty well.</p>

<p>Was a little let down by last nights episode, I want to see more action. Tyrion is royally fudgeed tho, little finger is a boss</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think anything will happen to Tyrion, he’s got to much clearance with Jamie and their father. Tywin will not allow a Lannister to be beheaded. Little Finger is starting to show his other face, I reckon he’s going to end up dying, his overly obsessive desires will be the death of him.</p>
<p>I also feel that Jon Snow is starting to become a revolutionary, after the small speech he gave to his brothers. In all honesty I think he has a chance at winning the throne, he’s persuasive, he’s caring and fair, and already has 2 advisers, a book worm named Sam and a right hand whose name I do not know but he’s one of the few recruits that are already trained in the nights watch, he hasn’t given his vowels yet.</p>
<p>There were rumors about Daenerys and Snow becoming king and queen, if you want the details you’ll have to google it. Speak of her, she still pisses me off. It’s good that she is freeing all the slaves, but her penisiness still pisses me off, and it’s better off that she cannot control her own dragons. If it were any other way, she would be totally OP.</p>

<p>I’ll wait for the whole season to finish before I start watching so I can watch in bulk. The only thing I don’t like about the show is very the reason it’s so good and praised for and that is because the author doesn’t give a shit about the characters, if you like them they’ll get killed off. I hate that the author justifies this by a simple motto, “no man is safe.” It’s a good show don’t get me wrong but now they’ve left me with most of the characters that piss me off. Like Daenerys Targaryen, I feel she rose to power with quite a bit of <span class="bbcode-b">penisyness</span>, I don’t like it for some reason and now I hate her while everyone else is drooling over her. I feel the next big thing the author should do is kill her off, I mean if you find perfect and unexpected place in the show for her death (and make it gruesome) then that will be the biggest “holy shit” since toast.</p>

<p>What, or maybe it’s because she owns and can partly control 3 dragons?</p>
