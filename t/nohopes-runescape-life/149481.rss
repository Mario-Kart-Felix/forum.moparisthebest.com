    <description>My rune life

First My friend said he had a cool game on the computer called &quot;runescape&quot; I thought it was some dumb spaceship game where you shoot aliens. He told me late 2005. He made me a account called spyro brago9.
I ditched it and didnt play. Then he gave me his account called spyro8675309. It was level 11 . I had few but very good runescape friends. We did everything together. Some opf my friends were laserman111 , sportzgal29 , twinblade893 , walt1991 , hi dad67 , fire kc1 (hidads sister) , arc chris (firekc1&#39;s boyfriend). There were more but I forget.


After a few months I got my level up on spyro8675309 and then made a new account , Walt1990 , As walt1991 was my friend I made the account. He said it was cool that I made it. Walt and his girlfrined (so he told me) Were always playing. He said he lived like 50 miles away from me.

Then came june 06. I got member on spyro8675309 and was happy. Then now long after got member on walt1990. It was fun exchanging my items to one account to another , through bdude94 (a legend from myrune.com). Then I went to dwarf mines fally and met a level 100 named seneca eagle , I was like want to be my girlfriend , she said yes but I want free items. So I added her and logged for fun.

Then came early 07 and Was banned on both accounts in a 1 month range.For swearing on both accounts.

Then came early may on my private server I met &quot;zach&quot; he said he wanted to buy admin on my server for a runescape account. So I said yes and he gave me an account name C H A P S. No problems. I trusted him and my vibes were good. Then I Asked if I could see his main and he said yes. It was level 124 zachblue1234. I said cool and asked him if his irl friend on my server if he wanted to buy admin . He said no. I begged him (becuase he had to level 66 pures) but he still said no.Then after A few weeks bought member on c h a p s. I received it july 10th.Then  my membership was done on august 10th.

4 days later I joined a little community called javaisthebest. I was friends with the owner before. Late august we made an account together called gui pur3. He made the name. I asked him If I could have the account he said yes. So now its mine and he is currently a wc pure. 41 wc.

Now currently I have no member accounts. My two accounts are level 45 chaps and level 12 gui pur3. By the way chaps is 60 range pure. And I have a good friend named maryjane (I forget the numbers) But I still added my old friends from spyro8675309 so I didn&#39;t lose everything. But I also forgot to add that hidad 67 was getting membership for his friend iijrii , I asked him if I could have pass he said it to me and I kept level 86 skiller iijrii. He had good skills. But was as poor as a hobo. He had steel plate rune legs steel kite ddp and recovery boots. I bought Member for him and transfered items to him , but he was recovered back.

Thank you for reading.


Edit: The most important part , how I got here. Well I had this friend named herk522 and his irl friend named acdcfreeq. I met them in mid 06  , they were level 30 when I met them. They were both members. They did everything with me also. Then they started playing wow and became inactive on rs2. I felt sad. But one day herk got on and said acdc found a great for runescape. Moparscape! I didnt realy care. He told me the website But I forgot it. Then a month later he got on again and I asked him what the website is he said moparisthebest.com . Then he explained how it was but I didnt understand. So I went to mopar and didnt know how to play. But I didnt know how to join the forums so I wasn&#39;t another &quot;h0w ply srvr&quot; . But late 06 I figured it out , I got on 127.0.0.1 and didnt know where everyone was so I quit for a week. Then I got on 2 other  servers and thought it was great. Then I asked my friend bdude94 (he played) and he said he quit becuase it had a virus.

So then I went on runescape and my one friend metalwolf64 said he was making a private server , I asked him if it was moparscape and he said no. LOL. He explained how it was and stuff and he said he was watching the video and was going to make it. The next day I got on and asked him if he was still making it and he said he quit becuase it was to hard.

I am done now! If I remmeber anything I will edit.</description>

<p>Selling admin on a private server for a runescape account, talk about desperate.[/quote]Funny , I did not beg for the account , I asked him . I did not say “PLEASE! i BEG YOU THAT I NEED THAT ACCOUNT!!! PLEASE!!!” And selling admin on server is not desperate , when you feel like it it’s a good way to get things. I was not in need of cash , extra things are always nice.</p>
