    <title>HTC Desire HD or iPhone 4?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/htc-desire-hd-or-iphone-4/404722</link>
    <description>That time of year has come where I have to get a new contract, coming from a Nokia 5530 this is quite a jump, though she was good back in its day.

I&#39;ve read reviews, watched videos, but still cannot make my mind up.
Best features of each phone? discuss etc.

fyi, I much prefer the look of the iPhone, but I&#39;m prepared to ditch looks for hardware any day.
I&#39;m in the UK, and network preferences would be either Three or Orange, swaying more towards Orange.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Brolapse, post:4, topic:404722”]I got a desire hd back in october and I’ve loved it ever since, I haven’t had a single app that has lagged and the large screen makes playing games awesome, the camera is great too you can get some really good photos with it. One thing I hate about iphones is you can’t change the storage, the desire hd comes with an 8gb minisd card. Even though it has a large screen it fits really nicely in my pocket. I paid about £300 for it and am on a contract with t mobile for £10 a month which gets me 100 minutes, unlimited texts and basically unlimited internet(Says 1.5gb a month but they wont charge if I go over, which I’ve never managed to do)</p>
<p>Definitely go for that over an iphone 4. I haven’t looked in to the Galaxy S II but if it’s got better specs than the desire hd then go for it.[/quote]<br>
Sounds good, cheers <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I’d be sure to get at least 16gb SD card anyway, I’m a big music fan.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t buy an iPhone 4 now given how it is due for an upgrade within the next month or two. HTC Desire HD has been out for a while too, if you’re looking for an Android alternative to that - why not take a look at the Samsung Galaxy S II?</p>

<p>Seems like a decent phone yeah, college lecturer has the first galaxy s, though, does it have the stupid headphone jack that all samsungs seem to have, where it needs a connector to plug the standard 3.5mm headphones in?</p>
<p>edit: nvm, found it in the wikipedia page, standard 3.5mm slot.  hm, no contracts on carphone warehouse <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"><br>
Wow the reviews are great for it, besides the battery, only thing is that it’s 100 quid more than the Desire HD, worth it?<br>
[/quote]Why would you get one with a contract? It’s a fuckton more expensive in the long run.[/quote]<br>
Oh?  Find me a good deal, must have unl. texts, 200+ minutes and just a little internet, don’t mind if it’s just 250mb.<br>
It’s like 500 quid unlocked, plus the pay monthly sim would be £10+ a month.</p>
<p>I can’t imagine that being a huge amount better than what’s here: <a href="http://shop.orange.co.uk/mobile-phones/plans/planDetails.jsp?bbPlanId=&amp;updateBasket=&amp;notbbPlanId=&amp;pagefrom=&amp;id=sku4190029">http://shop.orange.co.uk/mobile-phones/plans/planDetails.jsp?bbPlanId=&amp;updateBasket=&amp;notbbPlanId=&amp;pagefrom=&amp;id=sku4190029</a><br>
Thinking about the panther 30.</p>
