    <title>Increase HSTS timeout</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/increase-hsts-timeout/539863</link>
    <description>Right now it&#39;s only 5000 (83 minutes). This means that when you visit moparscape a lot of browsers wont keep you on HTTPS if you haven&#39;t visited in an hour or so. Is there any advantage to having it this low?

I propose that the HSTS timeout is increased to at least a month as I see no reason to have it that low. The only reason I can think of is certificate expiry, but it could simply be replaced a month or so before it expires (it&#39;s free anyway).</description>
