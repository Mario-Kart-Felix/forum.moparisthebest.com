    <title>Netty and slight delay</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/netty-and-slight-delay/450131</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to figure this out for a long long time. Nothing seems to fix it.

For example, when you walk first time, it&#39;s instant, but when you walk right after that it has about 300ms delay, it&#39;s same with all the actions, it&#39;s like the pipeline was busy and waits for the old packet to get executed, but it doesn&#39;t make any sense to me since I&#39;m using [i]cachedThreadPool[/i] as boss and workers, and using [i]NioServerSocketChannelFactory[/i], it shouldn&#39;t be blocking it.

You can see this problem live at StorkPK if you want to see it on your own eyes. 

Any hints towards fixing it is appreciated. If you want more information feel free to ask, or even see the structure of the server via TeamView.</description>

<p>I’m not sure what you mean with the ‘action’, but I answer as I understood it; It happens with all the packets that are received.<br>
[/quote]Like, if someone tries to walk and then tries to talk. Is talking delayed by walking, or does walking only delay walking? In addition, is it isolated to each user; like, can my walking cause a delay on someone else’s walking.</p>
<p>Also, I wasn’t sure on what you were considering actions; you used it in the OP.</p>

</aside>
<p>If you go back &amp; forth, the second/third walk attempt gets delayed or doesnt get executed at all. You could just hop on the server and see, or I could record it. The ping also spikes when it happens, with about +100-200ms. And it’s not only with walking, it’s literally every incoming packet. Inventory actions, walking, shop actions, bank actions, attack, trade, etc.</p>
<p>Not sure if it affects others, I’m pretty certain it doesn’t as when you idle you have constant 100ms ping without any spiking.<br>

              <p>I’ve been trying to figure this out for a long long time. Nothing seems to fix it.</p>
<p>For example, when you walk first time, it’s instant, but when you walk right after that it has about 300ms delay, it’s same with all the actions, it’s like the pipeline was busy and waits for the old packet to get executed, but it doesn’t make any sense to me since I’m using <span class="bbcode-i">cachedThreadPool</span> as boss and workers, and using <span class="bbcode-i">NioServerSocketChannelFactory</span>, it shouldn’t be blocking it.</p>
<p>You can see this problem live at StorkPK if you want to see it on your own eyes.</p>
<p>Any hints towards fixing it is appreciated. If you want more information feel free to ask, or even see the structure of the server via TeamView.</p>
