    <description>So, the story begins. One day my friend told me to see his &quot;youtube&quot; movie, I watched it, got interested, made a &quot;youtube&quot; account (also nt55 as is my &quot;runescape&quot; account) and then I look at some of these runescape videos. About half of the ones I watch have MoparScape in them and I decide &quot;this is exactly what I was looking for!&quot;. So I visit this site, I follow your downloading instructions souly for the purpose of gaming, not programming, although I&#39;d love to learn how. And then I get some problems, some I fix, some I dont. This is where you guys come in.


On youtube I saw people walk through walls, cast magic spells without runes, trade with people for outstanding items, and type things like &quot;:pickup 1030&quot; to make a red party hat poof into thier inventory, I got onto my hybrid server.....and I can&#39;t do any of it! its just like a normal runescape world, which is not what I wanted......please help with this.

Also, I have to make a &quot;Hybrid Server&quot; to play, and I&#39;m all by myself.......I want to play with other people so I go into the server status list and I copy the information from there into the game as I interpet it, now either I&#39;m reading the info wrong or something, I really dont know.

With reading this and being the kind people that you are, expecting to be flooded by players in distress, please help.</description>

So I visit this site, I follow your downloading instructions souly for the purpose of gaming, not programming, although I’d love to learn how. And then I get some problems, some I fix, some I dont. This is where you guys come in.</p>
<p>On youtube I saw people walk through walls, cast magic spells without runes, trade with people for outstanding items, and type things like “:pickup 1030” to make a red party hat poof into thier inventory, I got onto my hybrid server…and I can’t do any of it! its just like a normal runescape world, which is not what I wanted…please help with this.</p>
<p>Also, I have to make a “Hybrid Server” to play, and I’m all by myself…I want to play with other people so I go into the server status list and I copy the information from there into the game as I interpet it, now either I’m reading the info wrong or something, I really dont know.</p>
<p>With reading this and being the kind people that you are, expecting to be flooded by players in distress, please help.</p>
