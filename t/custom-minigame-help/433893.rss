              <p>I’m not too sure how to do this but I believe the structure would be something like this.</p>
<p>Make a teleport to the designated area which also tells the user the cmds they’ll need later.<br>
Make cmds that the player can use while in this designated area which spawns objects and add a 1 square wall into your cache under where objects are saved etc. Don’t forget to put n,w,e,s co-ords in i.e. the cmd could be ::spawn wall north which would spawn the wall north side on the position the player is standing.<br>
Also, don’t forget to make it disappear when the player logs/tele’s away.<br>
Its very low tech I know but it would work, sorry i can’t tell you how to do it code wise but thats a structure that you can use.</p>
