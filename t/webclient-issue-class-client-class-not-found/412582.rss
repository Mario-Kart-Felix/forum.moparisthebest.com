    <title>Webclient issue. &gt;&gt;class client.class not found&lt;&lt;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-issue-class-client-class-not-found/412582</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with this webclient. I&#39;ve went over my codes 10-20 times and have not come across a single error..

 My cache is uploaded to dropbox with the correct link in the correct spot:
[code]
downloadcache(&quot;http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2320554/cache.zip&quot;, &quot;cache.zip&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;cache&quot;);
[/code]
The zipped file is named &quot;cache.zip&quot;

My signlink is done correctly:
[code]
public static final String findcachedir()
{
String s;
String s1;
File file;
s = &quot;C:/.xelphoria_file_store_32/&quot;;
s1 = &quot;&quot;;
file = new File((new StringBuilder()).append(s1).append(s).toString());
if(file.exists() || file.mkdir())
{
[/code]

And finally, all of the sprites loading from class30_sub2_sub1_Sub1 look like this:

[code]
C:/.xelphoria_file_store_32/Files/Spirts/
[/code]

I&#39;ve jarred and signed the client 100% right, a multitude of times.

Yet I get this error still:
[code]
load: class client.class not found.
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: client.class
	at sun.plugin2.applet.Applet2ClassLoader.findClass(Unknown Source)
	at sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2ClassLoader.loadClass0(Unknown Source)
	at sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source)

	at sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2Manager$AppletExecutionRunnable.run(Unknown Source)
	at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)
Exception: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: client.class
[/code]

Something that might help:
I&#39;ve gotten the webclient to load previously(no idea how..)but I had a &quot;connection error&quot; after the cache was downloaded. The files/folders in the cache.zip file (other than the cache, itself) couldn&#39;t be downloaded.

I have no idea what I&#39;m doing wrong. Please help me. Spoonfeeding is much appreciated, as I&#39;ve been working on this for nearly 2 weeks. If somebody could TV me, that would be a lot of help, as well.

Thanks in advance.</description>
