    <title>[RESOLVED - SOLUTION PROVIDED] Name change</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-solution-provided-name-change/519066</link>
    <description>I think we have the right to be able to change our names. 

Taharok a very long time told me that there are very frequent requests from users asking to have their usernames changed but apparently it would cause confusion among members on who&#39;s who which my solution would be do what Jagex did and have &quot;lastly known as + name&quot;. 

Some reasons why people may want a name change?
- Lacked creativity when creating the account
- Bullying
- Don&#39;t want to make a new account due to status&#39;s, ranks, posts etc
- Time for a change?
etc!

There may be a mod for this with smf if not get one of the web noobies to do it :D?</description>

<p>"  The primary goal of COPPA is to place parents in control over what information is collected from their young children online.  The Rule was designed to protect children under age 13 while accounting for the dynamic nature of the Internet.  The Rule applies to operators of commercial Web sites and online services (including mobile apps) directed to children under 13 that collect, use, or disclose personal information from children, and operators of general audience Web sites or online services with actual knowledge that they are collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children under 13.  The Rule also applies to Web sites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information directly from users of another Web site or online service directed to children.

<p>That’s not our problem. If parents can’t manage their children or the child is being purposely rebellious–whatever reason, they are subject to our terms of service if they apply here. If they are under 13, it’s not our problem. This forum is specifically geared for a slightly older crowd (I would say 16/17-20s). If they are 13 and cannot handle this place, no one forces them to stay.</p>
<p>And I don’t want to hear anyone’s sob story about bullying they’ve dealt with in their life. We’ve all dealt with this shit. You don’t want to hear what I’ve been through and I don’t want to hear what you’ve been through. I was 13 once and I was actually on this site then. Go ahead and try having the name mod taharok, think you actually know what you’re talking about, and decide to spend most of your time on an ACTIVE <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>. This community is ridiculously tame compared to how it used to be. So yes, for more people that may and likely will experience what I went through, I will remain adamant in my decision. I’m not going to change someone’s name other than the criteria I’ve already mentioned.</p>

<p>Generally, changing of minor things (capitalisation, spelling, removing or changing numbers) has generally been permitted without a problem, but speaking as an ex-administrator I’ve had several people ask to be changed to a name that is already occupied with the account having made several posts, this is generally not permitted.</p>

              <p>Bullying was an extreme reason, as stated before. The whole thing isn’t about changing names because of bullying, it is about changing your name because you have a valid reason. Just because you’re all tough nuts, that doesn’t mean everyone is. Some people are more emotional then you and are inexperienced with things like bullying, how can you just tell someone to get over it? It is extremely insensitive, and people actually need help with things like this. You say it is easy to stop online bullying, ‘oh just turn it off, that will fix it!’, but no, it won’t. Those people still talk about you, spread rumours, and all that other degrading fun stuff. Just because you ignore the person doesn’t mean it will stop, at one point i had a member of this community recruiting his friends to bully me. That doesn’t mean much now, and it was dealt with, but it still happened. Had i been younger, as a few members on this community, i may not have been able to bounce back. You need to realise that there are problems you can’t fix in this world just because you say ‘oh, they’ll get over it’.</p>

<p>You’re required to be 13 to register on this site (or any site in the United States, without parental monitoring). I expect anyone 13 and up to be able to deal with this. If they cannot, they are free to ignore the person in question. This is the entire process of growing up in life…learning to deal with people who disagree with you or people that just hate for no reason at all.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>: I’ve already considered implementing a system that adds a profile field for the last name someone has. The biggest problem wasn’t changing names, it was twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Coming up with proper regulations that are fair. Initially, I had no problem doing slight alterations on people’s names and, for the most part, I still don’t. I used to give people the opportunity to done one single massive name change, but this was abused pretty quickly, with multiple people coming back again and again.</li>
<li>The sheer amount of requests an admin gets is more than you guys realize. I used to get a good 5+ name change requests per day. This may not seem like much, but when you only visit the forum for fifteen minutes every week, it really adds up.</li>
</ol>
<p>The point is, if we implement a new system the administrators are going to be overwhelmed even more. Because of this, I’m still on the fence about implementing anything whatsoever and am still bouncing around several ideas of getting this feature implemented for the userbase.</p>
