    <title>Why Social Lives Are Dangerous</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-social-lives-are-dangerous/168120</link>
    <description>This is the story of how I did the scariest thing of my entire life, the circumstances are pretty bad, a lot of you probably won&#39;t believe them, but I&#39;d thought I&#39;d let people know what happened, because I love these forums so much.

My Night:
Around 9:00pm- Me and my friend eric are hanging out at my house. He has a suspended license, is on probation for another month for 3 counts of grand theft auto, and loves to have sex with women. He has a 7:00 curfew in which he has to call his P.O. from his house phone, and hope they don&#39;t call back to check in. We&#39;ve already taken my mom&#39;s car with her consent to his house and back. At his house, his friend came over while we were waiting for him to call, and we made plans for later.

Around 9:30pm- Me and Eric are at a Wal-Mart gas station, our friends are in their car behind us, were having fun. We decide to drop my moms car (a 2004 dodge durango) off back at my house, and then ride in our friends car for safer measure, as there seemed to be a lot of cars out tonight. Eric gets a call and decides he is going to get dropped off at a friends house 3 miles away from mine to get laid, we drop him off, and hang out until 11, because the driver I&#39;m with has an 11:00 curfew.

Around 11:00pm- I get dropped off, and we make plans for the week, I&#39;m gonna get smoked out, I get some numbers, and come inside. I tell my mom about how there was so many cops, and she told me that she read today in news press that almost every cop, even most with desk jobs are out tonight, looking for people (this is the part I think I wouldn&#39;t believe if I read this). My mom goes to sleep around 12:00, and I&#39;m sitting on the couch watching myth busters until I get a call from my friend around quarter after 1.

Around 1:15- Eric calls me and tells me that the girl that drove me home is stuck at her boyfriends. The story I got was that her boyfriend who lives in a gated community snuck his mom&#39;s car out to get her and a friend, when on the way back, his mom calls. He tells them it&#39;s to bad, but he&#39;s GOT to go home, and can&#39;t drive them back. Now they are stuck in a gated community a few miles away from there house, with a ton of cops out. Eric tells me don&#39;t worry yet, but I might have to pick him up to pick them up later.

Around 1:30- Eric calls me, tells me I gotta find the keys and pick him up, after a few minutes of looking around my mom&#39;s room, I find them, he tells me that most cops change their shifts every other hour, and to come at 2 when they are switching, I agree, and wait till then.

Around 1:45- I think I&#39;m going to massacre my pants, so I take a rr break, and finished an episode of myth busters before I call eric to tell him I&#39;m on my way.

2:00 on the dot- I leave. I stick the keys in the ignition. I have no license, or learners permit. I am 15 years old, and I have about an hour and a half tops driving experience. I try to get on the main road off my street, and I&#39;m so nervous I realize right when I&#39;m about to take my foot off the break at the stop sign I can&#39;t get out this way. I get there ok, I had to go on two fairly busy roads during the day, and saw 1 cop in a black charger on my way.

I don&#39;t know, probably quarter after 2- I pick up eric, and we have to travel on a back road most of the way, which I&#39;m happy about. We pick them up, and me and eric agree to kick this kid&#39;s ass tomorrow, but def not tonight. No problems dropping them off, or getting back home. Then I had to drive back home, which turned out ok.

around 3:15- Eric&#39;s girl calls me to tell me that I&#39;m going to have to pick him up at 4. I hate him, but he&#39;s like a brother, and I gotta admit I love the rush, so I&#39;m doing it, I&#39;ll give an update when I get back, at this time I should be leaving in 20 minutes or so.

UPDATE:
Left to pick up Eric at quarter to 4. Even drove home. Got back and my mom&#39;s door is open, but she&#39;s asleep. I left as-is and put the keys back where I found them. Now I just gotta wait &#39;till morning.</description>

<p>Social lives aren’t dangerous. Unless you make them be like that.</p>
<p>Clearly this guy is a good friend of yours to request you to do this. A true brother.</p>

Not even close. Benadryl is an extreme deliriant.<br>

<p>Erowid lies?[/quote]If I remember right, Erowid lists diphenhydramine as a deliriant. At any rate, my experiences with diphenhydramine and small amounts of alcohol tell that tripping on Benadryl is in no way similar to being drunk.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Before I undertake the customary duty of giving Martin an uncomfortable few minutes it is part of the official duty of the best man to thank Martin on behalf of the bridesmaids, Sezan, Canan and Clare for his kind words and for having them play a part of this really special day. I have to say they all look wonderful and have done an excellent job. Indeed they are only eclipsed by Arzu herself, who, I’‘m sure you’'ll all agree, looks absolutely stunning.</p>
<p>It is a great privilege to be asked by Martin to be his best man. He has quite generously returned the favour that I asked of him 6 years ago, during which Martin took the opportunity to make lots of cheap jokes at my expense, so I now have the right to reply.</p>
<p>I suppose the first thing the best man should explain is how he knows the groom. Well, being his identical twin we first met long before we can both remember, so we are very close. There’‘s nothing I wouldn’‘t do for Martin, likewise there’‘s nothing Martin wouldn’'t do for me, in fact we spent most of our time doing nothing for each other.</p>
<p>I will start at the point of our early life as toddlers.</p>
<p>Growing up together in those early days, I am proud to say that I was an angelic child, no trouble to anyone, but the same could not be said of Martin. He showed no respect to his elder twin brother. I became an innocent victim of his loutish behaviour. &amp;quotLloyd, flush you socks down the toilet" he used to say. And under duress I did.</p>
<p>But that lout grew up into the well-mannered and well-presented individual we see sitting here today. Martin has matured.</p>
<p>For instance I can tell you that Martin is very well read - he has after all read all 45 of the Mr Men books from cover to cover. In fact, at the age of five, whilst living in Australia, Martin had a great idea to wander off into the dense, wild outback behind our house to look for Mr Jelly, whom he had read lived in the middle of a forest. He convinced me to go with him and we got terribly lost. By the time we had found our way home, there were lots of tears. Not for the fact that he had been lost in a forest, but that Martin never found Mr Jelly’'s house.</p>
<p>On the subject of Australia, it was there that Martin began a love affair which still lasts to this day.McDonalds. Age six, we were ever so excited to make our first visit to McDonalds…and the great thing about this place was the kids playground - it was like a mini-theme park - things to climb, things to slide down, things to spin around in.all for the enjoyment of children who had just scoffed their face with burgers and fries. It was whilst Mum, Dad, Verity and I were sat inside the restaurant that Martin, having just stepped of the swings, appeared the other side of the window.knocking loudly so that everyone in the restaurant noticed him. My parents played along and waved back…until Martin, in full sight of everyone tucking into their lunch, brought up his fast food as quickly as it had originally gone down, all over the window pane. Suddenly my parents stopped waving and momentarily tried to pretend he wasn’‘t theirs, although sadly as Martin’‘s twin was sat with them at their table, they couldn’‘t fool anyone. The waitress gave them some reassurance.&amp;quotDon’'t worry guys, that happens here all the time."</p>
<p>His love of fast food however never stands in the way of his enjoyment of sport. Martin usually waits until half time to get off the sofa to ring for a pizza.</p>
<p>Some of you may be aware of his passion for cricket. What many of you don’‘t know is that his interest in the sport was borne during his time at school. Martin is a modest man - well, that’'s what he has insisted I tell you - so his cricket achievements are little known. But I can reveal today that at school, Martin SCORED more runs than any other person in the entire cricket team - that was because he was always 12th man putting up the numbers the scoreboard at the pavilion.</p>
<p>After school, Martin went on to study environmental science at Kings College London. I am told by his friends many of whom are here today that Martin had a natural flair for the subject. They tell me that no matter how remote a place Martin was sent away on field trips, he could gauge and interpret the direction of the wind, the contamination of the soil and the pollution of the air to produce an accurate assessment of where the nearest local pub was to skive off to have a pint of lager and a packet of crisps.</p>
<p>But Martin had to fund his extra curricular activities. Being a student with far too much time on his hands and always in need of an extra few quid, Martin decided to exploit a promotional campaign at Selfridges, the famous department store on London’‘s Oxford Street. The deal was that customers were entitled to a 㾶 voucher if they purchased an item from all seven floors. Martin managed to get round the store and buy small items which came to the grand total of 37 pence. It was an all time record amongst his fellow students. Selfridges had no choice but to pay out the 㾶 voucher, which Martin then redeemed for cash. What’'s more impressive or should I say sad is that he did this seven times in one day to walk away with a hard earned 㿲. Unsurprisingly, Selfridges ended their promotional campaign rather abruptly.</p>
<p>Although Martin studied environmental science, I began to doubt his true commitment to the green cause when he purchased his first car after leaving university a Volkswagen Beetle. Now, I’‘m not sure what year the Beetle was made, though I believe the front of the car was made in the early nineties and the rear of the car some years before. Martin spent hours in that car, usually trying to get it to start. It was the only vehicle that you wouldn’‘t use a traditional road atlas or street map to navigate your journey. Martin’'s Beetle was so economically inefficient and powerless that he had to plot his routes using an ordinance survey map to make sure that his entire route was downhill. With careful planning, Martin could achieve this and the only flaw was making the return journey home by the same route.</p>
<p>Being Martin’'s older twin, by a whole five minutes, I realise Martin that you have now reached the age that I was when I started this speech and with that you will gained the maturity and wisdom that I had back then. So this is probably a good time to for me to show some respect.</p>
<p>Joking aside, I want to say what a privilege it is today to be your best man. I couldn’'t wish for a better brother and how much you mean is really impossible to put into words. The whole family is proud of you Martin, and we are all thrilled to see you marrying your beautiful bride Arzu today</p>
<p>So it now gives me immense pleasure to invite you all to stand once more and raise your glasses in a toast for Martin and Arzu. We wish them well for the future. To love, life, laughter and happily ever after… Martin and Arzu.</p>

              <p>This is the story of how I did the scariest thing of my entire life, the circumstances are pretty bad, a lot of you probably won’t believe them, but I’d thought I’d let people know what happened, because I love these forums so much.</p>
<p>My Night:<br>
Around 9:00pm- Me and my friend eric are hanging out at my house. He has a suspended license, is on probation for another month for 3 counts of grand theft auto, and loves to have sex with women. He has a 7:00 curfew in which he has to call his P.O. from his house phone, and hope they don’t call back to check in. We’ve already taken my mom’s car with her consent to his house and back. At his house, his friend came over while we were waiting for him to call, and we made plans for later.</p>
<p>Around 9:30pm- Me and Eric are at a Wal-Mart gas station, our friends are in their car behind us, were having fun. We decide to drop my moms car (a 2004 dodge durango) off back at my house, and then ride in our friends car for safer measure, as there seemed to be a lot of cars out tonight. Eric gets a call and decides he is going to get dropped off at a friends house 3 miles away from mine to get laid, we drop him off, and hang out until 11, because the driver I’m with has an 11:00 curfew.</p>
<p>Around 11:00pm- I get dropped off, and we make plans for the week, I’m gonna get smoked out, I get some numbers, and come inside. I tell my mom about how there was so many cops, and she told me that she read today in news press that almost every cop, even most with desk jobs are out tonight, looking for people (this is the part I think I wouldn’t believe if I read this). My mom goes to sleep around 12:00, and I’m sitting on the couch watching myth busters until I get a call from my friend around quarter after 1.</p>
<p>Around 1:15- Eric calls me and tells me that the girl that drove me home is stuck at her boyfriends. The story I got was that her boyfriend who lives in a gated community snuck his mom’s car out to get her and a friend, when on the way back, his mom calls. He tells them it’s to bad, but he’s GOT to go home, and can’t drive them back. Now they are stuck in a gated community a few miles away from there house, with a ton of cops out. Eric tells me don’t worry yet, but I might have to pick him up to pick them up later.</p>
<p>Around 1:30- Eric calls me, tells me I gotta find the keys and pick him up, after a few minutes of looking around my mom’s room, I find them, he tells me that most cops change their shifts every other hour, and to come at 2 when they are switching, I agree, and wait till then.</p>
<p>Around 1:45- I think I’m going to massacre my pants, so I take a rr break, and finished an episode of myth busters before I call eric to tell him I’m on my way.</p>
<p>2:00 on the dot- I leave. I stick the keys in the ignition. I have no license, or learners permit. I am 15 years old, and I have about an hour and a half tops driving experience. I try to get on the main road off my street, and I’m so nervous I realize right when I’m about to take my foot off the break at the stop sign I can’t get out this way. I get there ok, I had to go on two fairly busy roads during the day, and saw 1 cop in a black charger on my way.</p>
<p>I don’t know, probably quarter after 2- I pick up eric, and we have to travel on a back road most of the way, which I’m happy about. We pick them up, and me and eric agree to kick this kid’s ass tomorrow, but def not tonight. No problems dropping them off, or getting back home. Then I had to drive back home, which turned out ok.</p>
<p>around 3:15- Eric’s girl calls me to tell me that I’m going to have to pick him up at 4. I hate him, but he’s like a brother, and I gotta admit I love the rush, so I’m doing it, I’ll give an update when I get back, at this time I should be leaving in 20 minutes or so.</p>
<p>UPDATE:<br>
Left to pick up Eric at quarter to 4. Even drove home. Got back and my mom’s door is open, but she’s asleep. I left as-is and put the keys back where I found them. Now I just gotta wait 'till morning.</p>
