    <title>Reyx7 + Noobs are ftw</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reyx7-noobs-are-ftw/418176</link>
    <description>I usually don&#39;t mind this sort of stuff but now they&#39;re taking it a little over the top.

Basically, some person built a house near reyx7s/noobs are ftws and they basically told him to leave within [b]one[/b] minecraft day, he then didn&#39;t leave and they killed him and burnt his house down.

I think that should definitely class as griefing, I know you have the space idea but giving him one minecraft day and not making any attempt to border off your land isn&#39;t fair so they shouldn&#39;t be allowed to burn his work down...

Opinions?</description>

              <p>It’s a limited world and we’re trying to promote peaceful coexistence. PvP being on is what’s causing the tension (and people are already forming factions again…)</p>
<p>I think it should definitely count as griefing, there’s no rule anywhere that says griefing is allowed if they’re less than X blocks away. And allowing people to ‘claim’ land with fences or whatever is outrageous, you find the person with the most wood and they can claim a large area with fences… Building ‘close’ to someone could be an act of peace or togetherness, which is what we’re trying to PROMOTE, not discourage on this world. Obviously if the person built there to be an annoyance or constantly raid would it be different.</p>

<p>Around 30 blocks away probably but it was still unfair of them to burn it down after only one minecraft day, that’s no time at all.</p>
