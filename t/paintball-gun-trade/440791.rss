              <p>Yeah, and I’m sure they have them in paintball too, but when I go to this CQB field (Closest one sadly, which is not that “close” at all…) They have marshals standing on top of the biggest obstacles, a “watch tower” if you will, so if they see anyone cheating, they shoot them to see if they are cheating, and, if they don’t call out… then… yeah they get kicked out, so if the person who gets shot isnt honest, the marshal will get them, and since like I said not too many airsoft fields in LA, (At least the part where I live in, but around the area there are tons) a lot of 7-10 year olds go there where the rented shotguns are bigger than the kids themselves, my point, kids like that being there, one of them is bound to cheat to stay in, and the marshal is there to prevent the cheating!</p>
<p>TL;DR<br>
Marshals help prevent cheating, most effectively in CQB considering the small area <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Like I said before, you’re generally playing with a crowd that doesn’t cheat anyway. In actual fields a lot of people wear replica military gear. You hear a nice smack if they are hit or you’ll clearly see a BB hitting them. They even sell paint BBs (although they are rarely used as the piston breaks them very easily). If you go to a professional airsoft field then you are playing with the same range of people. They are older and mature enough to play a game.</p>
<p>When I have skirmishes at my farm, we have special punishments for people who cheat. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If you’re into the actual mechanics of your weapon, then airsoft is a much better choice. If you want your gun to be the best of the best, it’ll most likely require work on the innards from YOU. You learn a lot about typical stuff that is important (batteries, gears, etc).</p>
<p>You are biasing your decision simply on the fact that you played when you were young, probably in your backyard with a 230 FPS springer pistol.</p>

Its funny because paintball just gives you bruises, where airsoft usually gives you a bloodwelt, and they really sting like hell, and if you use .20 or .25 gram bbs they bruise and bloodwelt and feel like rocks being shot at you<br>
[/quote]<br>
First of all you don’t use bb’s with an airsoft gun, you use pellets (technical term)<br>
Second of all, paintball hurts 500000x more than airsoft, ask anybody<br>
Third, airsoft leaves a tiny little red mark not a bloodwelt<br>
Fourth, Painball bruises last for weeks sometimes months<br>
Fifth, I’ll wait for the infraction.[/quote]<br>
I have played both and I know how much an airsoft can hurt, same with a paintball, now please stop fighting etc etc</p>

<p>First, you use BBs.<br>
Second, if you play the game specifically for pain then you’re an idiot. Professional (meaning not 8 year olds running outside their house with Crosman Walmart guns) airsoft is meant for military simulation, hence why you can have exact military weapon replicas.<br>
Third, the welt obviously depends on the gun, distance shot, and other common sense factors. If I would have taken pictures of my friends leg after my grenade launcher hit his leg from point blank last summer, your argument would be invalid here.<br>
Fourth, see <span class="hashtag">#2</span>. Congratulations, you are bruised, does anyone really get jealous?</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>also, you can see when a paintball hits you, whereas people aren’t able to tell if another player is hit in airsoft.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You can see airsoft BBs. You can also hear them. I don’t have to worry about any issues with the people I play with, they are all trustworthy. I don’t need a painsplat or a bruise to tell everyone I was hit.</p>
<p>Airsoft guns are expensive simply due to the fact of how many more parts there are compared to the real steel versions, and also how much of a replica they are.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>And some come REALLY close to the real steel versions operationally/functionally speaking, like reloading the gun, taking it apart…</p>
<p>Heard systema makes really good mp5s and M4s close to the real steel versions</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Any airsoft company that isn’t Crosman or some cheap company makes similar versions, throw out the actual explosion of the bullet and they are exactly the same as a real weapon. I have an Echo1 SCAR-H and Javelin M16A3, I can post pictures on a later day if I remember. Used to own several full-metal airsoft weapons (Uzi, AK-47 to name a couple) as well, very similar to the real deal. Even plastic ones like my old Well L96 were very realistic feeling.</p>
<p>Actually got into the airsoft market last year. Bought gun deals and sold them on sites for a bit more. Also bought some used ones and fixed them up for reselling. Made around $80 profit just casually doing it over the summer (for about 2-3 guns).[/quote]<br>
Yeah I have a STG44 (I forget maybe cybergun?) Its very close to the real steel version tbh, other than the obvious things like rounds fire ofc…</p>
<p>It has metal where it should be, real wood stock, no plastic except the orange flash hider, and about the same weight as the real version, or close at least, somewhere like 9 pounds? Doesn’t cripple usage though, still easy to hold/use, and its actually pretty damn strong for an AEG, 490-500 with .20s iirc (I know FPS doesn’t define how good a gun is, just thought I’d throw that out there)</p>
<p>I have the well l96 too, other than the plastic body its a pretty good gun, other than the mag in the usual spring sniper position, looks very similar to the real steel version</p>

Thats cute, not realistic at all. Might as well play with nerf guns in your living room, youll save $9999</p>

<p>airsoft is incredibly lame.<br>

Airsoft is more realistic simulation where paintball has taken on a more sporty/agile scene. And I hope you aren’t basing it off those shitty guns from walmart that are airsoft guns. Real airsoft guns are easily over $150 and shoot 5x farther than paintball and still hurt and are incredibly accurate and customizable because most of them are real gun makes.[/quote]</p>
