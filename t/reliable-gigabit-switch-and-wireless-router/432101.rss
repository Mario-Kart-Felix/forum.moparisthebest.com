    <title>Reliable Gigabit Switch and Wireless Router</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reliable-gigabit-switch-and-wireless-router/432101</link>
    <description>[i]Im looking for a reliable gigabit switch for the Cat6A network I just put in. The cable and connectors I used can support up to 10G but those switches are much more expensive and none of my hardware has 10G ports anyways so it would be redundant + the infrastructure is there once 10G switches become cheaper. 

So if anyone knows of a reliable gigabit switch with 16 ports that would be great, if anybody works with networking any advice would be helpful.[/i]

[b]EDIT: I also need a new wireless router, something reliable from $50-$170[/b]</description>

<p>I guess it might slow down your internet speed slightly if you are already maxing out the network connection to your router, but in practice, no.</p>

<p>Okay sounds good Ill just combine them both into one computer save space/cash and like you said basically shouldn’t have to worry about it</p>

<p>I know this would be true if I was transfering something withing the network but if I am transferring a file from the computer that is also being used as the router will it affect it since both the internet and the file that is being transferred are coming out of the same nic</p>
<p>Seriously wish I would have waited and got that when it was on sale because I got the 16 port version for $120 from amazon, I mean thats a no brainer: more ports, a couple improvements, and lower price.</p>
<p>Also can I use the same computer that will be functioning as the NAS to route the internet connection without any internet speed reduction to the computers on the switch?

<p>You will certainly have to change some stuff to suit you in there, but it will enable ipv4 routing.  I have another set of scripts to enable/disable IPv6 running through Hurricane Electric.</p>

<p>The computer will be connected to the TV to playback video it will also needs to be used as a NAS and it needs to route the connections for the switch.</p>
<p>It looks like mopar says dnsmasq for that any other options that require little configuration and provide some kind of web interface like a dedicated router?</p>
<p>Ill also be using sabnzb for usenet and some type of media player for playback to tv, probably XBMC</p>

A few things I run include Transmission-daemon (bittorrent), Squid (transparent proxy), apt-cacher-ng (debian package proxy), SabNZBD (binary usenet downloader), lighttpd (web server as reverse proxy in front of all this stuff), and a Jenkins instance to automatically build a few projects.  Oh and dnsmasq for DHCP/DNS.</p>

<p>As to a wireless router, you want pretty much anything that will run DD-WRT, it’s a great firmware.  Generally you should stay away from Belkins, but anything Linksys/Cisco or netgear will do a good job.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah thanks for the advice guys went ahead and ordered the one I said. And I agree with what you say about DD-WRT but the problem I think today is manufactures try to pack so much extra shit like usb port for a network share that they end up making a shitty router. They need to focus on just making a high quality reliable wireless router that performs the basics well.</p>
<p>I think I might head to the ddwrt forums to see what they would recommend</p>

<p>Just a basic unmanaged, will be “behind” a router</p>
<p>And thanks guys, I saw positive reviews on amazon but for some reason I always though TrendNET’s where cheap crap but I was wrong.</p>
<p>I think I am going to go with this one:</p>

<p>It seems maybe one or two people have had issues with this but they were both pushing large amounts of data through this.</p>
<p>Basically whats going to be connected is, 2 Samsung Smart TVs, Pioneer Network Audio Reciever, 1 Computer and 1 Computer/Server, and 3-4 network IP cameras. I could probably get away with a 8 port switch but I want the expand-ability.</p>
