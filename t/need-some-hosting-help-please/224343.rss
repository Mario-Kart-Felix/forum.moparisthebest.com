    <title>Need some hosting help, please</title>

    <description>Well, ive been having issues with hosting my runescape server for a while. When i first got my new internet connection i could host the first month or 2 and then i got a router so i could get my internet anywhere in my house with my laptop, but then when i went to host my server, it didnt work. I found my problem, i didnt port forward yet, so i did the port forwarding and it worked again for about an hour and then stopped. Now hardly anyone can get on at all.  If anyone could help me that would be a great help.</description>
