    <description>Okay so I made another topic about this but it got washed away and I actually got one response but it was too complicated for my tiny brain to handle, I registered to make this post and that stupid quiz because I remember having lots of fun on moparscape and wish to play with the community of it again, but I keep getting this problem:
I go to moparisthebest.com/, and theres a huge white box. In the top left corner, it says &quot;Error, click for details&quot; with a notebook paper and a red exclamation mark on the bottom next to it. I click. I get a window called Application Error. Two choices. Details, or ignore. I click details. I get a window opened that is named &quot;Java Console&quot;, copied and pasted, this is what is inside:
Java Plug-in 1.6.0_17
Using JRE version 1.6.0-oem-b104 Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM

So, the person that helped me out, Epic Steve, said this:

[quote=&quot;Epic Steve, post:2, topic:366007&quot;]1011373133 to HEX is 3C 48 54 4D to ASCII is &lt;HTM..

This is the start of a HTML document - This could be the start of a 404 (File not found).
Make sure that the Jar file is uploaded properly and that the main class (AppletBot) is being loaded from the right package.[/quote]

I made a reply saying that I didn&#39;t understand, and I&#39;m not familiar with coding and compiling and editting and scripting and stuff, but that&#39;s when I left and it kinda just disappeared. I&#39;d really like to play here again and make a good first impression, but I know if I leave it there, it&#39;ll get no attention, and I&#39;ll never play here again. I&#39;m sorry.

Thanks for the help, it is VERY appreciated.  :)

EDIT: And please understand that I did look around the entire section of help for this problem and found nothing, I looked in the common compiler thread for the java.lang thing and couldn&#39;t find anything I understood there, even did google searching like that annoying quiz taught me and nothing... I AM trying.</description>
