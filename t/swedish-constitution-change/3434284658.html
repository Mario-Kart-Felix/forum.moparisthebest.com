<p>Really, you gun nuts make me laugh harder by the day. I’ve said it before, Lothy tried to push it away: Do you really think that an organised army is scared of a bunch of unorganized hicks with guns? Do you think so low of your own army?<br>

<p>As frell said, most of the military would be on our side. But to answer your question, I’m sure a bad government is more scared of most people having guns than if <span class="bbcode-s">none did</span> a very few did. A well trained army of 1 million soldiers still wouldn’t stand a chance against 50 million armed civilians.[/quote]</p>
<p>I fully understand what you, lothy and frell are trying to say, but think of it another way. (PS, wouldn’t 50~ million or equivalent population(around 17% in this case) be more of a revolt?)</p>
<p>I know I’m sort of derailing here, but lets just take a look at some hypothetical situations with rioting for a minute. Again I just want to say I fully want to understand what you are trying to say about guns, I agree, I wouldn’t go face to face with someone holding a gun, and preferably not even if I had one too.</p>
<p>No. 1 Country with no guns, government does some shitty things, country wide rioting, and in this case the high majority of armed forces agree with the government: most people surrender, those people with a death wish die, government continues with shitty things. Death toll would be very low(depending on a lot of factors) until another country intervenes.</p>
<p>No. 2 Country with no guns, government is bad etc you should know the drill by now, and in this case the high majority of armed forces disagree with the government: best case is the majority of the forces fight amongst themselves until the matter is resolved, civilian death toll would be very low I imagine.</p>
<p>No. 3 Country with guns, government is bad etc, armed forces agree: right off the bat hundreds of thousands of people die, why would the armed forced take the risk of going easy on people rioting with millions having guns? Similarly, citizens and the armed personnel that are rioting will fight back, death toll would be very high for both sides.</p>
<p>No. 4 Guns, bad government, forces disagree: simple revolt, somewhat low death toll I imagine.</p>
<p>I may be talking out my ass but I can’t see how citizens with guns helps much at all in such situations. Again, no research was done, this is purely speculative. Probably a load of bs but from memory the only such thing that happened in recent times was No. 1, so there isn’t really anything to do research on.</p>

You’re overlooking a more subtle method of warfare – assassination. You don’t always have to assassinate the president, you know.<br>
There are plenty of other politicians that are far less protected by the government.</p>
<p>Snipers at wartime do one of two things: They shoot the leader of a group of soldiers, so nobody wants to lead; or they shoot the first person following the leader, so nobody wants to follow. There’s plenty of followers to shoot, namely anyone that supports the changes that are corrupt or bad for whatever reason.</p>

        <p><span class="mention">@Niall</span>, Look at a situation that actually happened.  America, 1796.  England’s governing of America sucked and was unfair (taxation without representation).  Almost everyone in America had guns, they organized their own form of government, put together an army, and kicked England’s forces out.  Which is why the founding fathers of America gave us the right to bear arms, it protects against bad governments, and invasions by foreign powers, just like when the militia was called up to protect the USA again when England tried to take back America in the war of 1812.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="mention">@Niall</span>, Look at a situation that actually happened.  America, 1796.  England’s governing of America sucked and was unfair (taxation without representation).  Almost everyone in America had guns, they organized their own form of government, put together an army, and kicked England’s forces out.  Which is why the founding fathers of America gave us the right to bear arms, it protects against bad governments, and invasions by foreign powers, just like when the militia was called up to protect the USA again when England tried to take back America in the war of 1812.</p>

<p>In the revolutionary war we had something called the minute men. When someone would invade all the farmers and men in the community would hear the sound of the town bell and grab their guns and go to the center of the town and wait for the invaders. This was our first military force.</p>

Thank you Speljohan, I think my example is pretty much perfect.</p>

Are guns still relevant for civil defence now that we have nuclear, biological and chemical weapons?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Of course, a government would never use those on it’s own country because then it wouldn’t have a country to govern.[/quote]</p>
<p>Governments would and governments have. Saddam Hussain famously used chemical weapons on his own citizens for instance. They could be used for control as a scare tactic, say an oppressive government nukes a major city as an example, any other communities that revolt also get nuked. You betcha that all other communities will fall into line now.</p>
<p>Another thing would also be foreign invaders that would presumably have no qualms about nuking your cities.</p>
<p>One last thing is that you already have a mechanism to stop your government being oppressive. What I mean is the democratic system based on free elections with a free press monitoring the government’s every move.<br>
Perhaps all people who want guns for this reason are really admitting they have no confidence in their democracy? It wouldn’t be entirely surprising because the US system has sometimes been criticised since it has only two very major similar parties and has a flawed First Past The Post electoral system.</p>
<p>Then again, all I’m doing here is attacking the argument of widespread guns to protect against government tyranny, even if I manage to destroy this point there is still the one about guns for self defence against crime.</p>

<p>Even if citizens were to have guns, the government will have more guns. Take Iraq for example, certain sects oppose the government with their guns yet they haven’t achieved any policy changes.</p>

I meant the middle east is so corrupted that its a horrible example. And we aren’t talking about people revolting because the government raises taxes. A revolt would probably only happen in extreme case, like if our government was somehow overran and they tried to enforce communism etc.</p>
<p>This is only one of the many reasons that guns are allowed, though.</p>
