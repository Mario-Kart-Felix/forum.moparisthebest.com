    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-source/394173</link>
    <description>Can i use any client with any source? 

Also what does the source contain that the client doesn;t? Like whati s the source used for and what is the client used for? I know the client is to run it but theres many things in the client that are methods which go inside the game</description>

<p>The terminology people use on these forums still causes problems I see.</p>
<p>“The source” refers to the source code, or the .java files that are compiled to run an application. On the forums, this is often used to mean the “server source”.</p>
<p>A server is essentially what the client connects to, and processes the logic of the game.</p>
<p>A client is essentially anything that connects to a server. When playing a game, the client is what you directly interact with.</p>
