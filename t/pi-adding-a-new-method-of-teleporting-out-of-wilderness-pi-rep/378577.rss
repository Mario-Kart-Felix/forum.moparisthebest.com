    <description>I&#39;m trying to add something in the wilderness that makes you have a (law) rune in order to teleport out of the wilderness. I added something like this.

[code]if (c.inWild()) {
		if (c.getItems().playerHasItem(563,1)) {
		c.getItems().deleteItem(563,1);
		c.getPA().movePlayer(3088, 3499, 0);
		c.sendMessage(&quot;You use the law rune to escape from the wilderness!&quot;);
		return;
		} else {
		c.sendMessage(&quot;You need a law rune to escape from the wilderness!&quot;);
		return;
		}
		}[/code]

It will teleport me out, but lets say if I had 25 law runes in my inventory, it should delete only one, but in this case it deletes all of them. How do I fix this so it only deletes one rune?</description>

              <p>It may be that once you teleport out of the wilderness, it still thinks that you are still in the wilderness, if that makes any sense. Does the sendMessage that you have print 25 times if let’s say you have 25 law runes? Because if that is so, it means the program doesn’t recognize the fact that you have teleported out of the wilderness, and it performs a loop until you have no more law runes.</p>

              <p>i don’t think anything is wrong with it , but do mind your conventions please…<br>
did you add this for every teleport spell?<br>
or did you add it into the main teleporting void</p>
