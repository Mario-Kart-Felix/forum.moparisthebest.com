    <description>Hey y&#39;all Just wondering if there was a current command which can be made/used.

I would like it to be a ban, for like an amount of time eg, 30 mins or something like that. If this command could be made would be MUCH appreciated!!</description>

              <p>It is very possible to make this but I don’t think that the command would be kept in the client.java maybe some of it would be held in the server.java. but yeah it is 100% possible to do but its just finding someone with enough time to make it for you, i would make it but tbh im a bit to lazy sorry <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
