              <p>Yes you could do that to have people to trust use them but the point of what I was saying is give us like home 1 and home 2 teleport. That could help people have fun and have multiple home’s and yes people talk about the griefing and shit. The only way you would get rid of it would be to take out the teleport to home or spawn and that would ruin  a big part of the game, so alot of people would be mad.  Though were a small community it will get bigger hopefully and when it does people wan’t to have the most fun that they can have fun. Meaning building alot of shit and that I have been working on a town and I have my home and a island I have and its a pain to run and swim to my places. That alot of people will agree that it would be a paint to run and run to get somewhere. Well atleast you maybe when all the towns are finished make teleports to every town like I think im doing camelot so like /camelot and for varrock do /varrock. I hope alot of people get what I am saying.</p>
