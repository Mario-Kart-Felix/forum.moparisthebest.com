    <title>How to change 120/99 to 120/120 without d/cs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-change-120-99-to-120-120-without-d-cs/548978</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently coding a 667 server and have successfully changed the max stat for all skills from 99 to 120 with skaterguys help lol but the level after 99 doesn&#39;t change on the secondary part so I fixed that in class134.java but it d/cs my client unless i change it back to 99.</description>

              <p>Like I was saying the entire time when I helped you, just mirror the Dungeoneering skill, but don’t limit it to <span class="bbcode-i">just</span> Dungeoneering.<br>
Your client/server are built to have 99/99 everything, except dungeoneering. Meaning someone, somewhere, added some form of an exception for it to know dungeoneering could go higher. You have to do the same thing, for all skills.</p>
<p>Can’t be too much of help, as you know, seeing as I don’t know the 667 Server/Client or their structure.</p>
