    <title>Help With Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-client/329847</link>
    <description>I am running on linux now due to their VPN network setting to run my server + client. I am using linux mint and i have been running it for a couple of days. I click my runserver.bat and it just opens in TextEditor. So this should mean that linux doesn&#39;t support .bat files and my question is. Is there another option to running my client, if so than what? and Could i change .bat to another file to open my client.

Thanks in Advance

              <p>If it’s linux then, you need to change it in .sh but your code of your run.bat will be different. You will need to change it. I don’t know what’s the code though.</p>
