    <title>Help with client!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-client/311431</link>
    <description>I run a 508 server. I use Scaperunes 508 client. It works fine for me, but it won&#39;t work for my friend. When he tries to run it is gets stuck at connecting to updates. and The java run says error_game_Js5 connect. But my server is running and other people can connect to it. No other clients work for him. I checked his firewall and installed all new javas and it still won&#39;t work?....

If anyone could help I&#39;d highly appreciate it. :)
