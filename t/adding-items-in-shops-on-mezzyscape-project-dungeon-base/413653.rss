    <description>How do i add items in shops on mezzyscape/project dungeon base? I have shops, shophandler etc.

1) When i change what items are in shops, it still keeps the same item there but the image changes so it makes it look like the item was switched. Once you actually go to buy the item though it buys the item that was previously there. Overall how do you edit shops?</description>

              <p>shops.cfg, and client.java<br>
go into client.java, ctrl+f and search for the npc that sells the items, w8 till you come to a code that looks somewhat like this<br>
if(NPCID == npcid){<br>
PutNPCCoords = true;<br>
WanneShop = #; 						<br>
}</p>
<p>npcid is the id of the npc that sells the items, then go to wanneshop, and find what is the #, it could be 3, it could be 80 it could be 974897938493, that would be a lot of shops its probably something lower then 100 lol, note that # then go to shops.cfg and ctrl+f<br>
shop = #<br>
replace the # with the number that was after wanneshop = , and you will see a code similar to this<br>
shop = #	Pk_Shop_1					2	2	542	500<br>
this says shop id, when it is open name it “pk shop 1” on top, 2 means people can sell and buy any item from and to the shop. 542 is the item id, 500 is the amount it sells u can add more items just hit tab once after 500 and type the item id, then hit tab again and item amount, u can add up until the shop fills up, im not sure how many items but its one page, it doesn’t scroll down, probably like 20ish items.</p>
<p>don’t be spoon fed anymore</p>
