          <blockquote>
              <p>ok to change the id you need to change from class_8.java in you client files<br>
to make them visible while attacking you need to assigne an emote to them by:<br>
go in client .java and search for  <code> public int GetWepAnim() {</code><br>
scroll down theer should be like this <code>        if (playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 4151) // whip
        {
            return 1658;
        }
</code> copy and paste and existing one and eneter the wepon details and for a deff emote scroll down and serch  if whip its 1658 and slash 451 etc<br>
for the third one you need to go into iteams .cfg and add your wepon</p>
<p><code>item = itemid	itemname 	exemine		500000000	500000000	500000000	29	39	29	-15	0	181	193	198	-3	182	30	30
</code></p>
