    <title>Rule breaking posts</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rule-breaking-posts/212452</link>
    <description>I could not find any other way of getting this across and thought this was the best place for it, if any other staff member disagrees come have a chat with me on irc. But anyway on to the point:

If you do find a post that is obviously breaking the rules, we do [b]not[/b] need you to flame that person or repeat what that a person above has already stated.

[Thread poster] - How do i play moparscape? 
[First reply] - Wrong section, reported.
[Second reply] - Wrong section ([b]This poster would be warned[/b])

You will be warned for flaming that person or repeating what someone else above has already said, why have i decided to do this? Think about it, you flaming that person or repeating another person who posted before you is just making the situation worse. We would prefer it if you just report that person and leave the thread alone.
Its common sense guys, just have a think.</description>
