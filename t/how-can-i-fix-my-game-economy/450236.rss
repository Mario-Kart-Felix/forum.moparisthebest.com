<p>[quote=“The Wanderer, post:5, topic:450236”]Get rid of the old currency (probably gp) and introduce a new currency (like trading sticks lol). This way you basically did an economy reset without having to get rid of everyone’s items. You can then let players transfer gp to trading sticks for a set amount (depending on how bad your economy is. If everyone has 10b+, then I would suggest 10k = 1 of new currency or even more). And then make it harder to obtain items/trading sticks than it was before.</p>
<p>Best I can suggest with what you have given us.[/quote]</p>
<p>The best server economy I played on was when Ritzscape was in it’s glory days.</p>
<p>What they did was create a new currency that replace coins. 1m coins = 1 coin credit. It worked out really well. Coins were practically useless but coin credits were awesome. Sarasword was 1.5mcc, etc. The reason the economy suffered was because of duping.</p>

The economy will be just as inflated.  It may not seem like it at first, but it’ll be exactly the same.</p>
<p>I’m assuming your server has the same problem that I’ve noticed every server has.  People worry about the economy resets, the currency, bank resets, adjusting shop prices, etc. but the real problem is that you’re pumping items into the game, with no real way to remove them.  I’ve noticed a lot of servers give money for woodcutting, instead of wood.  Same with other skills (mining and thieving are the big ones that come to mind).  I mean seriously, if someones getting 50k gold for every swing at a tree, or every time the steal something from the stall, of course the economy is going to suck.</p>
<p>What I would suggest doing, is making these types of skills give you what they’re supposed to give (wood, ore, etc.), and then actually implement a use for those raw materials.  Whether it be other skills such as fletching, firemaking, and smithing, or minigames, or anything really.  Just make a use for them, and make them desirable to have.  The next thing is to make your rares actually worth something.  And I don’t mean just party hats, and other items like that.  I mean everything that should be rare… holiday items, good armor, everything.  What I’m saying here is, don’t make it so players get dragon constantly from a piss easy monster.  Now don’t make them to absurdly difficult to get, because then people are going to say fuck you and not buy them.  But at the same time, don’t throw all the good armor into a shop at the spawn location with item prices that are dirt cheap for your economy.</p>
<p>That’s my 2 cents <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>How is money being generated (as in, what are the different ways people can make things appear out of thin air)? Examples - woodcutting, tradable donation rewards, fishing, etc. And then how is money being taken out?</p>
<p>It takes a long time to ‘fix’ an economy. The number of custom items you have doesn’t matter, it’s how people get them.</p>
