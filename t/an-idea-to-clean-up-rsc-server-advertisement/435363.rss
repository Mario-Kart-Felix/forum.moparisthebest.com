    <title>An Idea to clean up RSC Server Advertisement</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-idea-to-clean-up-rsc-server-advertisement/435363</link>
    <description>As of now mods lock topics that are posted in RSC Server Advertisement and at the moment there is 5 topics locked on that forum. If mods were to move them to a junk section or to the proper place this would clear them up and take away alot of distraction.. I&#39;m sure we are all sick of seeing these posts littering up the advertisement section.

<p>Stop posting threads like this.</p>
<p>We lock threads to make sure the people that post them can look at their infraction and look at the topic it was for, and why. They’re pretty stupid so we try not to make it too confusing for them. Locked topics can’t get bumped, so just let them drown in the back, and we’ll probably delete them after we’re sure the owner has seen the infraction.</p>
