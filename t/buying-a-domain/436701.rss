    <title>Buying a domain</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/buying-a-domain/436701</link>
    <description>Hey,
I&#39;ve decided to partner up with someone and he&#39;s going to buy a domain but he cannot because his paypal is unverified. Anyone know of anywhere/anyone that he can buy the domain of with an unverified Paypal?
Would appreciate it thankchya&#39;s.</description>

You can call them if they have a phone line and tell his parents or use his bank account to make a transfer via the interweb.</p>
