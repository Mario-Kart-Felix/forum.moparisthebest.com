    <title>Executionable?</title>

    <description>Alright. So, I was looking to make a Runescape Private Server and came across moparisthebest.com
Which got me the v3.2 Web client, at first I thought I could make one simply there. No, I went to these forums and found this: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,342685.0.html

Very easy tutorial to follow. Very easy.

However, I got back to the Web client and found that it would not work, nothing happened. So I set the IP to the IP I set in the Port Forward steps and set the Port to the Port I set in the Port Forward steps. This time it told me the server had an error, and might be down.

I&#39;m just wondering what am I doing wrong? Also, I am wondering if there is a debug file I need to run? Or perhaps a MySQL database?

I have worked with Private Servers before for a different game, so have experiences. But this is completely different than those.

Oh, and sorry for my English, I am still learning.</description>
