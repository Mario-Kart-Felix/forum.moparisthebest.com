    <description>Ok,
I&#39;ve just had a long &amp; frustrating call with Sky Broadband. I spoke to a represent for them &amp; i asked them If they supported Port Forwarding. The answer was no. The woman then said
&quot;Users that use Sky Broadband have no rights to portforward as it is a breach of there contract. As soon as your Broadband is suspended for going against there contract will get you an automated black spot&quot;

This is just a warning. She then put me to tier 3 - There represensitives who say &quot;Running servers are strictly prohibited with Sky Broadband. You&#39;ll get a blacks spot and you&#39;ll be suspended.&quot;

Please,
This is for your safety for all Sky Users. I suggest moving to a different ISP or not putting a server online.

Thanks
Ghost.

PS -
Dont believe me? Go screw yourself, i couldnt care less</description>
