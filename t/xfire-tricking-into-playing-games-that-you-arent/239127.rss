    <title>Xfire: Tricking into playing games that you aren&#39;t</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xfire-tricking-into-playing-games-that-you-arent/239127</link>
    <description>This is a simple guide to show you how to trick Xfire into playing games that you aren&#39;t.
You could use this to show that you play Runescape. :P

[hr]

[b]Step 1:[/b]

You&#39;ll need an .exe file.
Any file will do, and I don&#39;t think you need some help on that?

[b]Step 2:[/b]

Through Xfire&#39;s menu, click [i]Tools[/i], then [i]Options[/i] then go to the [i]Games[/i] tab.
And wait for it to detect your games.

[b]Step 3:[/b]

On the left hand side you will see your installed games.
Soon, you will see fake games.

Right now, you should have your .exe ready.
Click the &#39;not installed&#39; text and you will see a full list of games to choose from.

I suggest you pick the first one, or this one as a start: [i]1602 A.D[/i]

[b]Step 4:[/b]

We now need to find out what is required for that game.
Click it, and then on the top right, or some where like that click &#39;[i]Manuel Setup[/i]&#39;

And then browse for the .exe we&#39;ve created.
Then hit [i]Apply.[/i]

A little message will come up saying that we are missing the file [i]1602.exe[/i]

[b]Step 5:[/b]

So, in that sense we will rename the .exe to [i]1602.exe[/i]
And then do the samething over again, but now we have the correct name.

Now, to make it show that you are playing the game, you will click the .exe
[hr]

For making it show that you play Runescape, you would perhaps scroll down the list until you see Runescape.
Then do the following because when you downloaded the Runescape client, you still need to route it.

This can be done to most games, others may require more then just one .exe running at once.
Anyways, have fun (I guess).
