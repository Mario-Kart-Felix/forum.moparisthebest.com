<p>No thanks.  Then I have no defense at all if a mob of people break into my house.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Brolapse</span>, sure, you can arm yourself with a knife too and maybe put up a fight against one, maybe even two bad guys with a knife, any more and you would be dead.  Also an old lady or handicap person would be dead against even one attacker, not so with guns.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/all">@All</a> rioters having guns, ridiculous.  You guys linked to all the riots in the US, did all those rioters have guns?  No.  Regardless, a criminal doesn’t care if having a gun is against the law or not, by definition they break laws.</p>

<p>I’d arm myself with a kitchen knife… they aren’t illegal. If guns were legal it’d be more likely the “angsty teen” would break in with a gun rather than a knife.</p>
<p>Anyways I don’t want to start a discussion about gun laws, America likes how it is there, we like how it is here. If you don’t then feel free to move to whichever place you prefer.</p>
