    <title>Can someone give me a full explanation, please?</title>

    <description>Sup, I have been away at making my server recently, and added my global objects just frequently, and have been testing with that. But, I noticed there&#39;s also a way to delete objects, but unfortunately, I don&#39;t know how, hence why I&#39;m here making this post. 

[i]Can someone give me a clear explanation on how to delete objects? I want to remake a town, thank you. I&#39;m putting a lot of effort into this server, and this will help me greatly.[/i]
