&lt;blockquote&gt;Want to create a programming language, but don&#39;t feel like going through one of those expensive and boring            1000 pages book ? Well, you&#39;re not alone ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Okay,
Have you ever wanted your very own programming language? 
 Would you like to have a programming language much better than Java, Python, Etc...?
Would you like great programs like Skype, or
amazing sites like Facebook to be using your programming language?
WOULD YOU like to be a MILLIONAIRE?
If you&#39;ve read the aforementioned correctly, 
You may have realized  the fact that, I&#39;ve used the word &quot;YOU&quot;, many a times.
Without &quot;YOU&quot;, this article would be useless..
You decide your own future. Whether you can earn a few thousand dollars programming from another mans programming language, or whether you&#39;re a millionaire, sharing your wisdom with the world.
I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if many of you people that are reading this write now have ever even gone on Google just to search about guides on making programming languages. Whether it is based on using Java;Python;.NET;C#.

Yet, now.
I&#39;m going to be linking you to an awesome product, which I&#39;m using at the moment.
This product has helped me through my time of being a &quot;script kiddie&quot;, a &quot;game host&quot;, and now to a professional programmer that is being paid a ton of money, just for a inspiration with a few words..

How many of you have gone on Google for a tutorial on making a programming language in either C# or VB.NET?
The two easiest languages out there.
No need for book of codes, just a few simple lines. Then you realise that your programming language is complete, and utter trash.
Your dreams are crushed, aren&#39;t they?
No, they aren&#39;t!!!

For only 885858eate a programming language, without that un-necessary book of codes that all of us hate.
Don&#39;t let your cheapness choose your future.
BUT WAIT,

“It&#39;s been a lot of fun, and surprisingly little work to get a language that covers 95% of what JavaScript can do.”

— Jeremy Ashkenas, created CoffeeScript after reading the book.
“I love this book! It helped me create my own Awesome-to-PHP compiler. It&#39;s not a full featured compiler yet but I had a lot of fun coding it and I learned a LOT.”

— Julien Desrosiers, created Phlower after reading the book.
“I never had a chance to study language internals at university, and while very interested, I found their inner workings intimidating. With this course I&#39;ve found a simple but engaging introduction to the world of lexers, parsers, interpreters and compilers, and suddenly a whole new world in programming has opened up. Highly recommended.”
