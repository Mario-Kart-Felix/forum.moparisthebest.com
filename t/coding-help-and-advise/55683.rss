William this is official the last warning that i give you …</p>
<p>[quote=“moparisthebest, post:1, topic:223”]Here are the rules and guidelines for both <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> and <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1.</span> We are not anti-leech. If you respect our community and our ideas, feel free to ask questions and they will be kindly answered if you follow other rules. Answer to questions that others ask if you know the answer or remain silent!<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">2.</span> We don’t talk about things we don’t know. This is an informative, not a misinformative community.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">3.</span> We don’t make spelling mistakes on purpose. We use “you” not “u”, we use “why” not “y” etc.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">4.</span> We don’t make posts that contain not useful information. Posts like “cool”, “lol”, “yeah” and “I agree” don’t contain anything useful for others. We are not fans of off topic, unless it contains something smart or funny. Most of things spammers find funny are actually not funny at all.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">5.</span> We don’t “bump” or double post.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">6.</span> We respect each other and other communities. We don’t flame each other or other communities. We don’t fight on the forums.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">7.</span> We don’t advertise other sites or communities unless we ask and receive permission to and from Moparisthebest. We don’t post links to sites that are not in safe sites list on <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> main page.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">8.</span> We don’t care about post count alone. If someone has high post count and most of it is spam, we hate him. If someone has high post count with informative posts, we love him. The higher count, the more we hate/love him.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">9.</span> We don’t talk about “rep” ever, whether you are asking for it or saying that you have given it.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">10.</span> DO NOT post or upload any copyrighted materials, ie deobs, clients or any other sort (however if you were to link to a file that was uploaded somewhere else or post code in the pasteBin, well, I would have no control over that right? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">11.</span> We don’t sell anything on these forums with the exception of SCAR scripts.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">12.</span> We never have misleading links in our signatures <span class="bbcode-b">or</span> posts.  If your signature or posts says <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.google.com</a>, we expect it to take us to <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a>.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">13.</span> Nothing to do with private servers belongs on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>, use <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> for these things.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">14.</span> We only have 1 Forum account for <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> and <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a>.  If you get banned or have trouble logging in, email an admin, or get a friend to contact an admin.  Multiple accounts will result in Bans.</p>
<p>If any of these rules have been broken, then you will be punished. So please, just follow our rules.</p>
<p>We’re not asking much. Thank you.[/quote]</p>
