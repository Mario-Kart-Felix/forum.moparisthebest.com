    <title>Transfer Methods?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/transfer-methods/379449</link>
    <description>As you all know, free trade is coming back, so im going to be botting non stop on froob accounts, and tradem to my main account, now my question is, Jagex for sure is going to be watching people who trade tons of money to each other for nothing, and probably ban them, any of you guys have some methods of transferring to lower suspicion? 

I have an idea, but this is all i came up with:

Me: I am quitting this stupid game, giving away my money little by little!

*Noob trades, give him 30k, another trades, gives him 60k, another trades, gives 100k*

Me: NOW FOR THE BIG ONE, GIVING AWAY (lets say in this case, 10m) 10M AWAY, MY LAST STACKO CASH!!!!

*My main happens to stroll by or is in the give away, but was unsuccessful to get any cash yet*

Me: *Directed to main* You look like a trust worthy person, not a nooby low level, promise me to keep my money safe, worked hard on it, *Gives me money, noobs cry and quit the game*

I know its a bit cheesy, but do you guys think it will work? And got any other ideas/methods?</description>

Hardly. Do you have any idea how much space it would take to keep a log of duels into the millions - Including what was staked - What levels the players are ect. Not only that by the time they have investigated your claim more and more duels have been made. They DONT log stakes they have the staff nor space to do that.</p>

<p>Ok. I know jagex’s fight against RWT trading wasn’t too successful, until all the new updates, but think about it I know not everyone did, but a lot of people got banned for trading.</p>
<p>Do you understand that people trade a vastly amount more then they duel. And YET, Jagex was still able to find RWT’s. Your saying they don’t keep a duel log because of the large amount of stakes, but think of the trade amount, and yet they still were able to catch people.</p>
<p>I believe you sir are wrong, they record based on certain criteria, I just don’t know what.</p>

<p>How do they differentiate between one person trading between his two accounts and one person giving purchased gold to another? Seems like they would just ban both sense they are both against the rules currently and just in case it was a RWT.</p>

              <p>They didn’t remove free trade and unrestricted wilderness because of players transferring gold between their accounts, they did it to stop people from profiting off their game through real world trading. Mod MMG said in his clan chat that players trading items between accounts they own is the least of their worries, not to mention how he believes that it shouldn’t be against the rules.</p>

I am sure they care or else they would not remove it its not like they had ‘save’ runescape they have another MMORPG coming out that will take many of runescape players away.[/quote]<br>
Well, then I guess all the appeals would be somewhere near “My brother is quitting Runescape and is giving me all his wealth.” or something of the sort?</p>
