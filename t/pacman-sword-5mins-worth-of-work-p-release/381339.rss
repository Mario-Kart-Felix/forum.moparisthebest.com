              <p>(sorry to say) 5 min or not its still an idea and some people could work at different ways/styles and i dont really like when people go negitive about others models but i still like the idea about it (i know my rep is low, not much login time, noob forum’r) but i seriously like it alot since its someones creative way of inspiring themself in a creative way no matter what it its or how its made overall 8.5/10 for the idea and model in my eye good job</p>
