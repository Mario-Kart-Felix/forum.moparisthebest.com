              <p>Thank you I will try to find it.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 17, 2009, 04:23:06 pm[/size][hr]The thing is. That I just want either a download link or maybe someone to help me. I want a server i can host with lots of quests and npcs like store people! and things to fight and kill! And how come some servers you cant edit the server.java and change the ip in there to my ip and host it? On some you can.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 17, 2009, 04:50:52 pm[/size][hr]do you mean project16? I cant find project19. I just want a server close to the real rs.</p>

<p>So instead of telling him how to make them you just laugh in his face cause he doesn’t know how to make them? Your post is retarded, it doesn’t help him in any way. Before you reply to this post don’t even bother, not here to fight with you, just to point out how much of a dick you made yourself. I helped him by pointing him in the direction of a server that has quests already coded into them. Your post was pretty much pointless.</p>
