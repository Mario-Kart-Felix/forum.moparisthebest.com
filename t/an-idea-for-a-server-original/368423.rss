    <title>An Idea for A Server (Original?)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-idea-for-a-server-original/368423</link>
    <description>Sorry if this posted in the wrong section...  :|

Okay so here is my idea for a new server, I&#39;m kind of developing it now.

You start off in this island called Oryion (Karamja) and everything you need is basically in one place (mining rocks, fishing spots, trees, flax, etc) but the thing is that the shop (the only shop mind you) only sells the basic things you need to get started to make things (the shop sells bronze pickaxe, hammer, knife, bronze axe, sleeping bag, etc. No weapons). 
So that means that the people are in control of the economy, and people are not reliant on the shops. Exp rate is either 1x or 2x. A pretty good challenge right?
Men, Guards and Heroes patrol the area, but you can teleport to other islands (using the teleport spells) to fight Dragons and Demons etc.
The adventurer teleports you to the wild in a random location (within a boundary, the random locs are)
You are cut off completely from other cities or areas (since the object, npc, and item locations are completely rewritten, it wouldn&#39;t even matter if you could reach them)

As stated before, I&#39;m working on this now, but I&#39;m using NOOBscape and I&#39;ve heard a lot that NOOBscape isn&#39;t good bc it uses EasyRSC. I want my idea to grow into something (hopefully) so if someone could possibly help with the dev or completely take control of the server/idea, it would be much appreciated.

Thoughts or Criticisms?</description>

              <p>if by 1x or 2x xp rates then i hope your not talking about 1x rs xp rates…<br>
if you are then good luck having people stay on your server longer then 5 minutes.</p>
<p>most people play rsps because rs is just boring, and very repetitive clicking… which is no fun, the only fun in rs is pking, which is why people come to rsps, to skip over training and money making and straight to pking. other reasons are free trade and some like something different, im not saying faster xp is the only reason people play private servers, but its definantly one of the things that people like in a private server, and i guarantee no one will play for longer than 5 minutes if you have same xp rates as rs, because then what would be the point in not just going to rs? because i doubt your server will be as good as runescape…</p>
<p>but other than that. i like the idea and i wish you luck on devolopment with this server</p>

              <p>You have a pretty decent idea going on here. In my opinion, 1 or 2x exp is quite low and you will find players getting bored too easily. I’d say max 15 - 20x will be good but thats just my opinion. If you have any questions, you can add me on msn or throw me a pm on here and I can help you out if you get stuck along the way.</p>

<p>Thanks alot mate <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
I have been doing considerably well with the client and server side when it comes to the Java files</p>
<p>And I have notice the community dying off too, its quite sad.<br>
My hopes are with this server is to make it a fun server, as in not in any competition to be the best out there, its just for people to come and go as they please, and for those who want more of a challenge <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
