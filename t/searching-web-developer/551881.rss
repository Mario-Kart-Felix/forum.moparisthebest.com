    <title>[Searching] Web Developer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/searching-web-developer/551881</link>
    <description>Hey, some of you may know me already, and have probably seen my server or my thread.
I have a SHIT ton of plans for my server. Me &amp; my developement team have really rewritten most of all the server (funtionalities, methods, oragnized alot of code) and most of all made the code as efficient as possible. There&#39;s tons of content being added, and brand new features aswell. When I say brand new, I mean it, this server is going to be more advanced than any other 718/742 around. I recently fired my web developer, and am searching for a new one or two that can work together. (really only need one though) Anyway, get in contact with me if you&#39;re interested and you must be a half decent web developer, and have a moderate amount of experience. I&#39;m not expecting some super professional even though that&#39;d be great. Get ahold of me via skype;

I have a SHIT ton of plans for my server. Me &amp; my developement team have really rewritten most of all the server (funtionalities, methods, oragnized alot of code) and most of all made the code as efficient as possible. There’s tons of content being added, and brand new features aswell. When I say brand new, I mean it, this server is going to be more advanced than any other 718/742 around. I recently fired my web developer, and am searching for a new one or two that can work together.
