    <title>How does Time work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-does-time-work/441577</link>
    <description>Hey guys, sorry if this is in the wrong section. If it is, would a moderator please simply move it to the correct section. 

In this topic, I would like intelligent posts filled with information with factual basis and reasoning; not just guesses or opinions.

Okay, this is really a sort of information first, then the discussion/questions.

To start off, I&#39;d like to show my representation of a segment of time. 
[IMG]http://i50.tinypic.com/2vtpl75.png[/img]

Now to the theory of time travel. If time travel if possible, then you can go from the future, to the past, and back to the future. So, I represent this idea in this picture.
[IMG]http://i50.tinypic.com/wcbns9.png[/img]

Now supposing the Butterfly Theory is correct, the future can be altered dramatically by a small event in the past, such as simply stepping on a butterfly. So with that said, here&#39;s my representation.
[IMG]http://i50.tinypic.com/21e860y.png[/img]

That&#39;s all the information. So with that said, now comes the questions that I&#39;d like to see people try to answer.

To start off, where would the original timeline go? There&#39;s a theory that there are an infinite amount of parallel universes, in which every single action that could be different is different. If that theory is correct, and so is the theory of time travel, that would mean that people wouldn&#39;t be just simply going back in time. Would mean that the time traveler is actually crossing into a parallel universe? If not, what happens to the old future? Could something as critical as time be existent one minute, then diminish completely due to time traveling being a possibility? 

Another question I have, is time an infinite loop? Does it just keep playing over and over again? How else would it be possible to go back in time? If time is an  infinite loop, that would mean that our lives are already planned out, and that they have already happened; free-will being just our imagination.




Sorry if this thread seems random and doesn&#39;t flow well. It&#39;s 5 in the morning, I haven&#39;t slept yet, and ideas and questions are popping up randomly in my head.
(Yes I know it&#39;s ironic that my name is &quot;Time&quot;, and I&#39;m making this thread :p)</description>

              <p>this is hard to  really think about  to the extremes. I have always viewed it similar to a time turner on Harry Potter. If a person disappears (going back in time ) then the event for the other time line ends at the person disappearing, there is  no time of return then.</p>

<p>Does this mean that there are now two The Wanderers, one living in the life in which I was late to work, and one living in the life in which I was on time. Or does the one that was late to work cease to exist as I went back in time to make sure I went to work on time, and am now living in that life?</p>

</aside>
<p>You would not be able to do it. Because, if you go back in time and make yourself arrive to work on time, in the future you will have no reason to go back in time (because you would not have been late) and so therefore no one would go back in time to stop you from being late. You’d then be late to work and the future you would go back in time to change it, but then the future you would not go back in time to change it because once it had been changed there would have been no reason to go back <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

I watched a documentary theorizing that if you travel at the speed of light, and have a watch. Once you stop going that speed, your family and friends are long gone. You haven’t aged a bit, and it’s still the same time time that you left with. The only way to travel to the future / past, is to travel at 186,282 miles per second / - (negative) 186,282 miles per second.<br>

<p>I thought, that if the whole wormhole theory is true. Then all of the matter and molecules looping us together are traveling through wormholes, and that the magnetic field of a wormhole isn’t strong enough to hold a being of any kind together. I suppose this is where Quantom contradicts Regular.</p>

lol yeah. velocity is a vector quantity, if you travel backwards you are only giving direction not negative values. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>[quote=“Tutorial, post:104, topic:441577”]I went back and read some of the posts which mostly discuss about whether time is even real or an abstract term (which at the average human perspective, it is) and I can even recall someone stating that the speed of light is the same for everyone, and that is true. The speed of another object doesn’t always effect the other unless there is a force of some sort acting against it, but in fact, let’s just say there are two objects - one moving at the speed of light and the other moving at 50 km/h, also the objects are not being acted on upon any other force than gravity. This would mean the only thing that could possibly make the other object appear any faster/slower is the gravity that is actually affecting that object, which is determined by the object’s mass. I’m not a guru of physics, but I most certainly can say that an object can only be changed by the act of another force, whether it is some unknown force we have not yet discovered, or if simply it is two objects colliding, which will include friction occurring.</p>
<p>The point is since we are discussing Time, we should consider only the things that scientists believe are possible, such as gravity, which obviously is one of the biggest effects in the universe. I cannot even begin to imagine what the universe would be if gravity did not exist,  possibly a black hole itself?[/quote]<br>
uh, black holes wouldn’t exist if gravity didn’t exist…</p>

You haven’t aged a bit, and it’s still the same time time that you left with. The only way to travel to the future / past, is to travel at 186,282 miles per second / - (negative) 186,282 miles per second.</p>

<p>you asked bowser jr what he is discussing followed up with the statement that you haven’t read the thread, the next post you make on the thread states that he shouldn’t argue when he has “minimal knowledge on certain subjects”, that makes you a hypocrite regardless of the timespan between the posts</p>
<p>you didn’t explain where he has “minimal knowledge on certain subjects” or what he is doing wrong</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I went back and read some of the posts which mostly discuss about whether time is even real or an abstract term (which at the average human perspective, it is) and I can even recall someone stating that the speed of light is the same for everyone, and that is true. The speed of another object doesn’t always effect the other unless there is a force of some sort acting against it, but in fact, let’s just say there are two objects - one moving at the speed of light and the other moving at 50 km/h, also the objects are not being acted on upon any other force than gravity. This would mean the only thing that could possibly make the other object appear any faster/slower is the gravity that is actually affecting that object, which is determined by the object’s mass. I’m not a guru of physics, but I most certainly can say that an object can only be changed by the act of another force, whether it is some unknown force we have not yet discovered, or if simply it is two objects colliding, which will include friction occurring.</p>
<p>The point is since we are discussing Time, we should consider only the things that scientists believe are possible, such as gravity, which obviously is one of the biggest effects in the universe. I cannot even begin to imagine what the universe would be if gravity did not exist,  possibly a black hole itself?</p>

              <p>Planet-X does exist, but not in the sense being described here.<br>
Edit: here, a better link: <a href="http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ask-an-astrobiologist/intro/nibiru-and-doomsday-2012-questions-and-answers" rel="nofollow noopener">http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ask-an-astrobiologist/intro/nibiru-and-doomsday-2012-questions-and-answers</a>.<br>
And again, quote: </p><blockquote>“Planet X” is an oxymoron when applied to a real object. The term has been used by astronomers over the past century for a possible or suspected object. Once the object is found, it is given a real name, as was done with Pluto and Eris, both of which were at some time referred to as Planet X.</blockquote>

              <p>Planet x is the theory that a planet is on the same “path” as earth… but is always on the other side of sun. Then there is another planet x theory which is actually named planet 1### whatever which is outside of Pluto.</p>
