    <description>Hey everybody I&#39;m undergoing a huge project to code a source that I&#39;m going to host. I need some help however. Whether you link me to a tutorial or tell me how to do it, or just view this, it&#39;s all appreciated. 

#1. My NPC&#39;s currently don&#39;t drop anything. Any ideas on how to fix?
#2. I want to add all item sets. Iron/mithril/rune/torags/dharok. All of them. Any tutorials or ideas?
#3. I want players to start with 99 summoning. So I can render it useless. Any ideas?
#4. I want it so when you go to drop an item, it asks if you want to delete it, and if yes it deletes it, if no it does nothing.
#5. I renamed the cache, redirected it and reuploaded it. It downloads and unpacks fine, however I get connection error? Only when using the cache i zipped, uploaded, downloaded, and unpacked.
#6. I want to add quests. Any ideas? Easy quests to add and complete in game.
#7. I want to make combat potions basically overloads, however with no hitpoint deductions and no emote. Also so you can&#39;t make them until after doing one of the quests. And some special items have to be combined to make them. Which also goes along with, I want full herblore. For example unfinished potions.

ANY TUTORIALS LINKED TO THESE OR HELP IS GREATLY APPRECIATED :)</description>

              <ol>
<li>Add drops, there’s like 100 tuts on this. Google it.</li>
<li>Item sets are already added? Or do you mean the GE box sets?</li>
<li>Change the starter. Search for “Welcome” or what ever it says upon first login (Client.java - Normally)</li>
<li>You’d have to change the drop action in the item (itemAssistant?).java…</li>
<li>You forgot to rename something. Or you packed the cache wrong.</li>
<li>Search around, there are pre-built PI-ready quests, modify or use those as examples.</li>
<li>Just add overloads and make custom requirements, no one said the overloads must take HP. As for full herblore, that’s up to you, there’s partial systems, but no one will give you the full thing.</li>

              <p>I’ve done all this to other servers. I know basic Java. I just want to see if anyone has a link to any tutorials or quick help so I don’t have to hunt down tutorials. Also, nevermind I added full herblore!</p>
