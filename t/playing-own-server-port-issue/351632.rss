    <title>Playing Own Server - Port Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/playing-own-server-port-issue/351632</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having trouble running my own server because no matter what I do it seems that I can&#39;t start the server on the Moparscape client and run it off the cmd file at the same time.  The order doesn&#39;t seem to matter; whichever one I do second tells me that port 43594 is already occupied.  I checked and am absolutely sure that it&#39;s not some other program using the port.

I did a lot of searching and couldn&#39;t find anything pertaining to this.  Probably it&#39;s because I&#39;m doing something really stupid and obvious that I just don&#39;t get because I don&#39;t have this kind of computer literacy.</description>
