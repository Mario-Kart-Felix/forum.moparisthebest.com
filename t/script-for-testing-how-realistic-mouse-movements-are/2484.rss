    <title>Script for testing how realistic mouse movements are</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/script-for-testing-how-realistic-mouse-movements-are/2484</link>
    <description>hey guys, this is my first contribution to this forum. the purpose of this thing is basically just to test how realistic our mouse movements are and also probally to show many of you why we keep getting banned. i am currently working on some really really really good humanish mouse movements that do a pretty good job of immitating the real thing, but there not done yet. to use it, just copy it into a scar terminal and run it. ull get a white canvas and then a target will pop up on it, click the target and youll be able to see the path you took, as well as the speed at certain points, red representing slow and green representing fast. now, to test a scar movement, im a affraid ull have to make a script in a second terminal because i am teh n00b at pascal and dont know how to make threads. just make the script look for the blue cursor and then click on it, ive included an example of this too. the script actually has to left click on the target too for it to work. enjoy.

btw, i know the programming structure sucks, this is cause its the first time ive ever used a canvas and it took A LOT of experimentation. also, when i wrote this i had no intention of releasing it, so theres no comments and there might be some missing spaces and semicolons. please dont judge me on this, i actually do know the correct syntax of things, im just lazy.

also, if you find this useful pls post ur humanish scripts here also.

EDIT: i dont know how to find the cursor position in relation ship to the canvas either, so to fix this I found the location of the title and calculated the offset. if anyone knows how to get the cursor pos in relationship to the canvas please tell me.


[code]
(* this script was written by *DEAD*. its purpose is to test how human like
   artificial mouse movements are. after hitting run, wait for the blue target
   to appear. then click it. the trail behind the cursor shows the path that was
   followed, and the colors indicate the speed, red being slow and green fast.
   to test an artificial function, make a second scar scrip that watches for
   the blue target to appear, and then click on it. (it has to be clicked on).
   
   the purpose of this, to prove how unrealistic our mouse movements are and
   why we keep getting banned.
   
   note: this was made for my own purposes, and have decided to share. the
   program is poorly written, and i dont recommend using it to learn from.

   also, if you find this useful, please post your humanish mouse movement
   script in the same forum that you found this.
   
   ps, i can program properly when i try, so dont flame me over the poor structure.

and heres an example of a script to click on the blue target, again the programming sucks, but hey it does the trick.
[code]

<p>yea i know the problem, ur screen resolution is too low. umm, basically im not gonna fix it cause its not really intended as a show off script, but if you want to use it change ur screen res to 1152*(whatever it is). or, you could just change the height and width constants to ur screen res, although then i dont think the target will work properly. o well, someone might find it useful.</p>

<p>My screen res is 1280 * 1024 and it still gives that error <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
