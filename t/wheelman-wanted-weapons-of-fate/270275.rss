    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wheelman-wanted-weapons-of-fate/270275</link>
    <description>
I&#39;ll do a joint thread considering they both came out a few days ago and I don&#39;t want to make two threads.
Oh and they both start with W.


I think these games are sick. I haven&#39;t played very many awesome games lately but I love these.

[b]Wheelman:[/b]
Kinda like a GTA meets Burnout. Car smashing to destroy other cars. Car jacking from car to car. On foot shootings. Shooting tires out. Special effects like slowing down time to get perfect shots from inside of a car. Etc etc.

Some parts could be better. Turning isn&#39;t very sensitive ie I have to move the joystick almost 60% left or right before it turns the car any. Not much else though.

[b]Wanted: Weapons of Fate:[/b]
Saw the movie when it came out. Though it was almost a year ago and I don&#39;t remember the exact story. The game seems like it follows a different storyline I think. Cover based TPS (LOTS of hiding behind cover). Blood. Blood. Blood. Quite a few melee takedowns. Special effects like curving bullets around objects, bullet time, shooting bullets in the air. Etc etc.

Also some parts could be better. I&#39;d like better graphics (I guess I&#39;ll wait till next gen).

Anyone like either of these? The demos are available.</description>
