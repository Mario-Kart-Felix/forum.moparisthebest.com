    <description>Hello, MoparScape.

Welcome to my 10th tutorial! Yes, I finally reached the big 10 :P. I know I didn&#39;t include this in my last tutorial as it would be my next tutorial, but oh well, things change :P lets hope I did good, eh?

You can view a live demonstration of this script at: http://www.xythax.org/form.php

I realise a lot of you won&#39;t know what dynamic content is, and for that reason, I&#39;ll run through this to begin with. Dynamic content is something that is loaded to the page while the page is static if you will. For example, have you ever filled in a form and it has thrown an error at you by saying &quot;Username already in use&quot;? that is dynamic content. We will be using a system like this, but not in the same way. We will also be loading an entire database load of testimonials using dynamic content. Without further ado, here is my Dynamic Forms/Content in a Testimonials Script tutorial!

[b]Part 1; writing the jQuery.[/b]
I realise that I haven&#39;t posted a jQuery tutorial and this is primarily because I myself am a beginner. I will write one soon though, don&#39;t worry about that. Right now, I&#39;ll post the code and talk you through it as usual, if you don&#39;t understand it don&#39;t worry about it, you will in time.
[code=jquery]
	$(document).ready(function(){
		$(&quot;#dForm&quot;).validate({
			debug: false,
			rules: {
				name: &quot;required&quot;,
                                text: &quot;required&quot;,
				email: {
					required: true,
					email: true
				}
			},
			messages: {
				name: &quot; Please use your in-game name so that we can contact you.&quot;,
				email: &quot; Please use a valid email address so we can contact you.&quot;,
                                text: &quot; Please include some text for us to read.&quot;,
			},
			submitHandler: function(form) {
				$.post(&#39;process.php&#39;, $(&quot;#dForm&quot;).serialize(), function(data) {
					$(&#39;#dynamic&#39;).html(data);
				});
			}
		});
	});
	&lt;/script&gt;
[/code]

Okay, so on your very first line, you have [i]$(document).ready(function() {[/i] this is what you put at the start of the script you&#39;re writing for your events. Every event you wish to include in your page must be inside this statement. You then have [i]$(&quot;#dForm&quot;).validate({[/i]. This is validating the information inside the &quot;#dForm&quot; which is called later. This then goes on to list the rules of this validation, which stores the elements in an array if you will. This states that the name is required, the email is required and must be a valid email address and finally the text is required for the form to be submitted. Below that we have another array if you will, this one holding the messages  that should be displayed if any of the above validation rules are broken. You must use the same tags as you did previously and therefore throughout the entire script, even after the jQuery part. We then have [i]submitHandler: function(form) {[/i] which is the part that actually controls the submission of the form we&#39;re using, this tells us that once we hit the submit button, we&#39;re sending and receiving data from process.php through the use of #dForm which is then posted into #dynamic on the form.php page. We&#39;re then just closing all the tags we opened.

This is the simple breakdown of this, I could  go into greater detail and explain everything more and more, but it would just overwhelm you at the beginning. You only need to know the above as to how the script works to be able to use and write your own.

[b]Part 2: Writing the html.[/b]
As with most HTML stuff, it&#39;s piss easy. I&#39;ll talk through it anyway, since it may differ a bit since you last screwed with HTML forms.
[code=HTML]
	&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.2.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.7/jquery.validate.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
//where the previous jQuery script should be
&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;style&gt;
	label.error { width: 250px; display: inline; color: red;}
	&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form name=&quot;dForm&quot; id=&quot;dForm&quot; action=&quot;&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot; id=&quot;name_label&quot;&gt;In-Game Name&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/label&gt;  
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; id=&quot;name&quot; size=&quot;30&quot; value=&quot;&quot;/&gt;  
	&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;email&quot; id=&quot;email_label&quot;&gt;Email Address&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/label&gt;  
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;email&quot; id=&quot;email&quot; size=&quot;30&quot; value=&quot;&quot;/&gt; 
	&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;text_label&quot;&gt;Your Message&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; rows=&quot;10&quot; cols=&quot;30&quot; name=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
	&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot;&gt; 
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;dynamic&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
[/code]
Okay, so as some of you may have noticed, I removed some of this script for talking through it, it just removes stuff that will only take up extra time that no-one will look at. So at the top of what I&#39;ve posted is including some of the jscript files we need to help us get through this, these are essential and remember to include them or your entire script wont work. We then declare &lt;style&gt; tags for displaying the error message besides the box that they are filling in. We&#39;re then starting the form for posting data. This is where we call the form as &quot;dForm&quot; as you may remember from earlier in the jQuery explanation and then we declare that we will be posting the data to the other file. We&#39;re then labeling this input box of the form as &quot;name&quot; since the user will be inputting their name here. This also helps for labeling it for errors, without doing this it wouldn&#39;t work at all. This is vital. This is repeated throughout the other input boxes and then we&#39;re labelling the submit button at the bottom. Now this next part is where the magic happens. [i]&lt;div id=&quot;dynamic&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;[/i] is where all of our dynamic content that we load is loaded into, if you remember from the end of our jQuery explanation, it&#39;s in there as #dynamic.

So that concludes this part of the tutorial, this is by far and wide the easiest part, if you don&#39;t understand it though, feel free to post on here or message me and I&#39;ll break it down completely. I&#39;d rather you tried to work it out yourself though, you&#39;d get farther that way since you&#39;re solving everything yourself, although I am here to help.

[b]Part 3; Writing the SQL part.[/b]
Okay, so I only recently covered SQL/PHP connections and manipulations, take a look over that tutorial if you don&#39;t already know what you&#39;re talking about. This is what stores all of the information in the database. As usual I&#39;ll give you the script and then talk you through it.
[code=sql]
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `testimonials` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(250) NOT NULL,
  `text` text NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
)
[/code]
Okay, so our first line of this script is telling the database to create the table testimonials if it isn&#39;t already there. We&#39;re then adding the `id` column as an integer which is a blank value and auto incrementing. We&#39;re then add the `name` column as a variable length character of 100 characters which is a blank value. We&#39;re then adding the `email` as a variable length character of 250 characters of a blank value. And finally adding the `text` column as text and a blank value ready to receive input. Also, we&#39;re adding the Primary Key(`id`) which is primarily used for searching through records and is a good habit to get into using.

Okay, so that sums up the SQL part of the tutorial, lets move on to our next language and next part, PHP.

[b]Part 4: Writing the PHP part.[/b]
This is my favourite part, seeing as I&#39;m a PHP man. This is the actual working part of the script, the part that inserts and retrieves data from the database. Since I just ran over PHP&gt;MySQL connections, take a look at the tutorial and you&#39;ll see what I mean if you don&#39;t understand this.
[code=php]
echo &#39;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;;
echo &#39;&lt;center&gt;Thanks for submitting a testimonial! We appreciate it.&#39;;
echo &#39;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;;
echo &#39;You can view the current testimonials at any time by going &lt;a href=&quot;/testimonials.php&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&#39;;

$db = &quot;yourdatabase&quot;;
$server = &quot;localhost&quot;;
$user = &quot;youruser&quot;;
$pass = &quot;yourpass&quot;;

$con = mysql_connect($server, $user, $pass);

mysql_select_db($db, $con);

$name = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST[&quot;name&quot;]);
$email = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST[&quot;email&quot;]);
$text = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST[&quot;text&quot;]);

if (empty($_POST[&#39;name&#39;])) {

die();

} else if (empty($_POST[&#39;email&#39;])) {

die();

} else if (empty($_POST[&#39;text&#39;])) {

die();

} else {

$SQL = &quot;INSERT INTO `testimonials` (`name`, `email`, `text`) VALUES (&#39;$name&#39;, &#39;$email&#39;, &#39;$text&#39;)&quot;;

$result = mysql_query($SQL);

}

$query = mysql_query(&quot;SELECT * FROM `testimonials` ORDER BY `id` DESC&quot;);
while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($query)) {
?&gt;
      &lt;table width=&quot;880px&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($row[&#39;name&#39;]); ?&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($row[&#39;text&#39;]); ?&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;?php 
}
   mysql_close($con);
[/code]

Okay, first off, add this file as &quot;process.php&quot; so that we don&#39;t confuse the file names from our jQuery script. So we&#39;re starting off with echoing some text and line breaks which will list below our form on our form script which this returns as dynamic content in the &lt;div id=&quot;dynamic&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; statement. After looking through several echo() statements you&#39;ll come to me declaring some variables, these are the variables which hold the connection information to the database, edit these to your information. $server will 99.9% of the time be localhost. We then go on to declaring the $con variable and utilizing the mysql_connect() function that comes with PHP, inside this function we include the $server, $user and $pass variables which is everything we need to connect to the mysql database. We then declare the $found variable and utilizing the mysql_select_db() function, we then include the $db and $con variables inside this, which is everything we need to connect and select our database. It isn&#39;t advised to directly insert POST attributed values into SQL statements, so we&#39;re now going to convert them into variables, declared as $name, $email and $text still sticking with our three names from earlier since they&#39;re easier to remember. As you can see, there&#39;s an extra line of code between each of these. That is simply a security measure to sanitize the variables in $_POST, this prevents XSS attacks and more of the like, if you&#39;d like to know more, use google. We then launch an if statement regarding the $found variable, so if $found has successfully accessed and found the database, do the code inside the statement. Starting by declaring the $SQL variable which holds the SQL query that we need to execute. For more information on SQL table manipulation check out the mysql website. We then declare the $result variable which then executes mysql_query() function which then queries the $SQL variable. We then add the else part of the if/else statement to tell us if it couldn&#39;t contact the database, this is just a single echo statement. We now come on to the part where I added a very small amount of formatting to the above code, but just before that we must review our latest SQL query. We start this by our $query variable which holds the mysql_query() function which holds the SQL query to list our testimonials from newest to oldest. We then declare a while loop, for more information on loops, check my PHP Loops tutorial out. This while loop declares that our newest  variable $row is equal to the $query. If this is true, it&#39;ll echo the following code which is a basic html table with a few edits. It echoes the username which is inputted into the form and the text that is inputted into the form. We then close our while loop and close our database connection.

That is the entire script and how it works, you now have small amounts of experience with dynamic content and how to use it in your websites! You can also include this on other pages in your site, by just adding the last sql query and connecting to the database  again, it&#39;s simple but effective and it will display at all times, not just after someone posts a new one.

I sincerely hoped you enjoyed this tutorial, it was delving deeper into website development and the mixing of three languages, and this makes it a lot more complex and difficult. You&#39;re getting well on your way to being good at website development, especially the PHP side if you&#39;ve been following my tutorials.

With best regards,
Ruby.</description>

mysql_real_escape_string($name);
$email = $_POST["email"];
mysql_real_escape_string($email);
$text = $_POST["text"];
mysql_real_escape_string($text);</code></p>
<p>you call mysql_real_escape_string and then do nothing with what it returns… do this instead<code>$name = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST["name"]);
$email = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST["email"]);
$text = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST["text"]);</code></p>

              <p>Hello, MoparScape.</p>
<p>Welcome to my 10th tutorial! Yes, I finally reached the big 10 :P. I know I didn’t include this in my last tutorial as it would be my next tutorial, but oh well, things change <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> lets hope I did good, eh?</p>
<p>You can view a live demonstration of this script at: <a href="http://www.xythax.org/form.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.xythax.org/form.php</a></p>
<p>I realise a lot of you won’t know what dynamic content is, and for that reason, I’ll run through this to begin with. Dynamic content is something that is loaded to the page while the page is static if you will. For example, have you ever filled in a form and it has thrown an error at you by saying “Username already in use”? that is dynamic content. We will be using a system like this, but not in the same way. We will also be loading an entire database load of testimonials using dynamic content. Without further ado, here is my Dynamic Forms/Content in a Testimonials Script tutorial!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Part 1; writing the jQuery.</span><br>
I realise that I haven’t posted a jQuery tutorial and this is primarily because I myself am a beginner. I will write one soon though, don’t worry about that. Right now, I’ll post the code and talk you through it as usual, if you don’t understand it don’t worry about it, you will in time.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	$(document).ready(function(){
		$("#dForm").validate({
			debug: false,
			rules: {
				name: "required",
                                text: "required",
				email: {
					required: true,
					email: true
				}
			},
			messages: {
				name: " Please use your in-game name so that we can contact you.",
				email: " Please use a valid email address so we can contact you.",
                                text: " Please include some text for us to read.",
			},
			submitHandler: function(form) {
				$.post('process.php', $("#dForm").serialize(), function(data) {
					$('#dynamic').html(data);
				});
			}
		});
	});
	&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Okay, so on your very first line, you have <span class="bbcode-i">$(document).ready(function() {</span> this is what you put at the start of the script you’re writing for your events. Every event you wish to include in your page must be inside this statement. You then have <span class="bbcode-i">$("<span class="hashtag">#dForm</span>").validate({</span>. This is validating the information inside the “<span class="hashtag">#dForm</span>” which is called later. This then goes on to list the rules of this validation, which stores the elements in an array if you will. This states that the name is required, the email is required and must be a valid email address and finally the text is required for the form to be submitted. Below that we have another array if you will, this one holding the messages  that should be displayed if any of the above validation rules are broken. You must use the same tags as you did previously and therefore throughout the entire script, even after the jQuery part. We then have <span class="bbcode-i">submitHandler: function(form) {</span> which is the part that actually controls the submission of the form we’re using, this tells us that once we hit the submit button, we’re sending and receiving data from process.php through the use of <span class="hashtag">#dForm</span> which is then posted into <span class="hashtag">#dynamic</span> on the form.php page. We’re then just closing all the tags we opened.</p>
<p>This is the simple breakdown of this, I could  go into greater detail and explain everything more and more, but it would just overwhelm you at the beginning. You only need to know the above as to how the script works to be able to use and write your own.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Part 2: Writing the html.</span><br>
As with most HTML stuff, it’s piss easy. I’ll talk through it anyway, since it may differ a bit since you last screwed with HTML forms.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.2.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.7/jquery.validate.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
//where the previous jQuery script should be
&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;style&gt;
	label.error { width: 250px; display: inline; color: red;}
	&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form name="dForm" id="dForm" action="" method="POST"&gt;
    &lt;label for="name" id="name_label"&gt;In-Game Name&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/label&gt;  
    &lt;input type="text" name="name" id="name" size="30" value=""/&gt;  
	&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;label for="email" id="email_label"&gt;Email Address&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/label&gt;  
    &lt;input type="text" name="email" id="email" size="30" value=""/&gt; 
	&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;label for="text" id="text_label"&gt;Your Message&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" rows="10" cols="30" name="text" id="text"&gt;
	&lt;input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit"&gt; 
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;div id="dynamic"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Okay, so as some of you may have noticed, I removed some of this script for talking through it, it just removes stuff that will only take up extra time that no-one will look at. So at the top of what I’ve posted is including some of the jscript files we need to help us get through this, these are essential and remember to include them or your entire script wont work. We then declare  tags for displaying the error message besides the box that they are filling in. We’re then starting the form for posting data. This is where we call the form as “dForm” as you may remember from earlier in the jQuery explanation and then we declare that we will be posting the data to the other file. We’re then labeling this input box of the form as “name” since the user will be inputting their name here. This also helps for labeling it for errors, without doing this it wouldn’t work at all. This is vital. This is repeated throughout the other input boxes and then we’re labelling the submit button at the bottom. Now this next part is where the magic happens. <span class="bbcode-i"><div></div></span> is where all of our dynamic content that we load is loaded into, if you remember from the end of our jQuery explanation, it’s in there as <span class="hashtag">#dynamic</span>.</p>
<p>So that concludes this part of the tutorial, this is by far and wide the easiest part, if you don’t understand it though, feel free to post on here or message me and I’ll break it down completely. I’d rather you tried to work it out yourself though, you’d get farther that way since you’re solving everything yourself, although I am here to help.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Part 3; Writing the SQL part.</span><br>
Okay, so I only recently covered SQL/PHP connections and manipulations, take a look over that tutorial if you don’t already know what you’re talking about. This is what stores all of the information in the database. As usual I’ll give you the script and then talk you through it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `testimonials` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(250) NOT NULL,
  `text` text NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
)</code></pre>
<p>Okay, so our first line of this script is telling the database to create the table testimonials if it isn’t already there. We’re then adding the <code>id</code> column as an integer which is a blank value and auto incrementing. We’re then add the <code>name</code> column as a variable length character of 100 characters which is a blank value. We’re then adding the <code>email</code> as a variable length character of 250 characters of a blank value. And finally adding the <code>text</code> column as text and a blank value ready to receive input. Also, we’re adding the Primary Key(<code>id</code>) which is primarily used for searching through records and is a good habit to get into using.</p>
<p>Okay, so that sums up the SQL part of the tutorial, lets move on to our next language and next part, PHP.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Part 4: Writing the PHP part.</span><br>
This is my favourite part, seeing as I’m a PHP man. This is the actual working part of the script, the part that inserts and retrieves data from the database. Since I just ran over PHP&gt;MySQL connections, take a look at the tutorial and you’ll see what I mean if you don’t understand this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">echo '&lt;br /&gt;';
echo '&lt;center&gt;Thanks for submitting a testimonial! We appreciate it.';
echo '&lt;br /&gt;';
echo 'You can view the current testimonials at any time by going &lt;a href="/testimonials.php"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;';

$db = "yourdatabase";
$server = "localhost";
$user = "youruser";
$pass = "yourpass";

$con = mysql_connect($server, $user, $pass);

mysql_select_db($db, $con);

$name = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST["name"]);
$email = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST["email"]);
$text = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST["text"]);

if (empty($_POST['name'])) {

die();

} else if (empty($_POST['email'])) {

die();

} else if (empty($_POST['text'])) {

die();

} else {

$SQL = "INSERT INTO `testimonials` (`name`, `email`, `text`) VALUES ('$name', '$email', '$text')";

$result = mysql_query($SQL);

}

$query = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM `testimonials` ORDER BY `id` DESC");
while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($query)) {
?&gt;
      &lt;table width="880px" align="center"&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td width="100%"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($row['name']); ?&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td colspan="2"&gt; &lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($row['text']); ?&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;?php 
}
   mysql_close($con);</code></pre>
<p>Okay, first off, add this file as “process.php” so that we don’t confuse the file names from our jQuery script. So we’re starting off with echoing some text and line breaks which will list below our form on our form script which this returns as dynamic content in the </p><div></div> statement. After looking through several echo() statements you’ll come to me declaring some variables, these are the variables which hold the connection information to the database, edit these to your information. $server will 99.9% of the time be localhost. We then go on to declaring the $con variable and utilizing the mysql_connect() function that comes with PHP, inside this function we include the $server, $user and $pass variables which is everything we need to connect to the mysql database. We then declare the $found variable and utilizing the mysql_select_db() function, we then include the $db and $con variables inside this, which is everything we need to connect and select our database. It isn’t advised to directly insert POST attributed values into SQL statements, so we’re now going to convert them into variables, declared as $name, $email and $text still sticking with our three names from earlier since they’re easier to remember. As you can see, there’s an extra line of code between each of these. That is simply a security measure to sanitize the variables in $_POST, this prevents XSS attacks and more of the like, if you’d like to know more, use google. We then launch an if statement regarding the $found variable, so if $found has successfully accessed and found the database, do the code inside the statement. Starting by declaring the $SQL variable which holds the SQL query that we need to execute. For more information on SQL table manipulation check out the mysql website. We then declare the $result variable which then executes mysql_query() function which then queries the $SQL variable. We then add the else part of the if/else statement to tell us if it couldn’t contact the database, this is just a single echo statement. We now come on to the part where I added a very small amount of formatting to the above code, but just before that we must review our latest SQL query. We start this by our $query variable which holds the mysql_query() function which holds the SQL query to list our testimonials from newest to oldest. We then declare a while loop, for more information on loops, check my PHP Loops tutorial out. This while loop declares that our newest  variable $row is equal to the $query. If this is true, it’ll echo the following code which is a basic html table with a few edits. It echoes the username which is inputted into the form and the text that is inputted into the form. We then close our while loop and close our database connection.
<p>That is the entire script and how it works, you now have small amounts of experience with dynamic content and how to use it in your websites! You can also include this on other pages in your site, by just adding the last sql query and connecting to the database  again, it’s simple but effective and it will display at all times, not just after someone posts a new one.</p>
<p>I sincerely hoped you enjoyed this tutorial, it was delving deeper into website development and the mixing of three languages, and this makes it a lot more complex and difficult. You’re getting well on your way to being good at website development, especially the PHP side if you’ve been following my tutorials.</p>
<p>With best regards,<br>
Ruby.</p>
