    <title>Lol my story</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lol-my-story/2372</link>
    <description>lol ok well I was in search of a free webhost so I went to google. After typing in what I wanted I went to the 1st site that came up. it was something like http://free-web-hosting.com. Ok well I made a site and used no-ip to redirect so cool I had http://scapearchives.no-ip.org. GEAT! I said lol. But I wasnt satisfied I needed a domain well since my servers name is weedscape i decided to buy http://weedscape.net well I merged with another server called SoulScape. We decided to instead of having a server site to just make a new community and have ArchScape (new name of merged server) promote it. Well since I had weedscape.net it wouldnt work because the name of this new community is &quot;ScapeArchives&quot;. Well looks like we needed another redirect. So our webmaster (raiden) made [b]http://scapearchives.net.ms[/b] and now we have finally set everything up and are ready for business! so please at least signup and check it out. give me feedback please also. But I kinda thought this was a good story that only took like 6 days to happen.</description>
