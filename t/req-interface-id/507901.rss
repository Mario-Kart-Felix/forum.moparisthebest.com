    <title>[REQ] Interface ID</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-interface-id/507901</link>
    <description>I didn&#39;t know where to put this, and it is somewhat client related. Is there a chat box interface that has 1 item option? Like the item is in the middle of the interface and has right click options of:
[code]Make 1
Make 5
Make 10
Make X[/code]
All I can find are similar interfaces but with 2, 3, 4, and 5 item choices.</description>

              <p>You’d have to add the amount you wish to make manually server-sided, I believe.<br>
I’ve got the interface ID’s for a few from searching it up, maybe it will help:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">205   What would you like to enchant?
2400   What would you like to smelt? (Smelt X)
4161   What would you like to make? [Rings, Amulets, Necklaces)
8866   What would you like to make?
8880   What would you like to make?
8899   What would you like to make?
8938   What would you like to make?
11462   What would you like to make (Glass stuff)
15328   What would you like to make in the churn?
15336   What would you like to make? [Churn cream, churn butter, churn cheese]</code></pre>
<p>Those interfaces should be for 317-377.</p>

              <p>The revision shouldn’t matter all that much, it most likely is either a 317 or 377 interface. The interface I’m looking for looks similar to this one, but with only one item option.<br>

<p>Edit: If there isn’t one, I’ll just make one.</p>
