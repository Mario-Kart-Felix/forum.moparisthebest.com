    <description>I&#39;m making a Dungeoneering base and I would like to disable items disappearing after a certain time period when they&#39;re on the ground. Can this be done by just editing something? Any help is appreciated.</description>

<p>If I were you, I would make your own Dungeoneering Ground Items class, so that you can modify it without effecting the rest of the game. You could rip most of the code from the Item classes already in PI.[/quote]<br>
I have everything that is included in dungeoneering under a boolean that toggles whenever a player is in a dungeon or not. So editing the item disappearing will not affect the rest of the game.</p>

<p>[quote=“m0ssyh0s, post:3, topic:477108”]I don’t know for sure how to do this and I’ll look into it when I’m not busy, but to point you in the right direction, it (probably) has to do with the createGroundItem() method in ItemHandler.java.</p>
<p>Edit : There is a variable HIDE_TICKS in there, you probably need to call createGroundItem() somewhere but instead of using HIDE_TICKS as a parameter, put like 10000 or something. Again, I’m not really sure.[/quote]<br>
I think I found out what I can do to disable it whenever players are in a dungeon, thanks.</p>
