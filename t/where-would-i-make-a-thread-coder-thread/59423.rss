    <title>Where would i make a thread coder thread?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-would-i-make-a-thread-coder-thread/59423</link>
    <description>Hello, I am N0 N4M3. I love to code things and I don&#39;t understand private server coding and I can&#39;t download anything on my computer, so I[hr] decided I would do coding on the forums. I would like to know where I can make a thread about this business I guess you would call it. I[hr] have a couple references already and I would like to get my name out there and get some more stuff to code. Basically, someone will post [hr]a link to their thread and I will code it for them in exchange for a mod/admin position on the server. Please, anyone who knows or atleast[hr] has an idea on what I should do, post it here. Greatly appreciated.
[hr]EDIT: If you would like to see a sample of my work, look up Teh0wn-Scape. First post was coded by me.

              <p>I code the first posts, look at Teh0wn-Scape’s first post, It was just plain text before, but I coded it to make it stand out and grab peoples attention. Most server owners don’t know how to/Don’t care to/ Don’t have the time to do this, so I do it, plus I enjoy it.</p>
