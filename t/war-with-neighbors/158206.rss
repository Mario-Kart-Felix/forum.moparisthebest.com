    <title>War with Neighbors</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/war-with-neighbors/158206</link>
    <description>Well to start off, i live in townhouses, so like everyone gets 2 spaces behind there house. So this morning by neighbor decided to park in our spot, so my mom put mustard all over they&#39;re car, and get it towed, So they got a fine. So then the stole my bike! we got it back, they put it on there lawn (retards) so now i have to retaliate because if i dont theyll think theyv won. What should i do? i was thinking about getting alot of my biger friends and go scare the shit out of them.</description>

              <p>Well to start off, i live in townhouses, so like everyone gets 2 spaces behind there house. So this morning by neighbor decided to park in our spot, so my mom put mustard all over they’re car, and get it towed, So they got a fine. So then the stole my bike! we got it back, they put it on there lawn (retards) so now i have to retaliate because if i dont theyll think theyv won. What should i do? i was thinking about getting alot of my biger friends and go scare the shit out of them.</p>
