    <title>House M.D. 6th season premiere thoughts?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/house-m-d-6th-season-premiere-thoughts/303654</link>
    <description>alright so tonight was season premiere of 6th season of house, and i was fairly disappointed. basically, for those of you who havent watched it, it consists of how house was living in the institution, etc.

his hallucinations of amber and kutner have disappeared, and he seems to be getting better

however, you see how he starts to develop happiness and true faggotry. thats alright for anyone, who isnt house. they fucked up the beginning of the series. because the truth of the matter is that house is an egotistical doctor who is addicted to two things: vicodin and his cases

apparently, they have cut him off the vicodin and he seems ok with it (which i think wont last very long), seeing as he is done detoxing, and he has revealed a &quot;new side to him&quot;; happiness. you see how he develops feelings for this german milf, and later is crushed again seeing as she is forced to move to arizona. because of these feelings, the therapist felt it was ok for him to be released. this is how the 2nd episode finishes. if it werent for this ending, i wouldve probably stopped watching house because of this new attempt to enforce traits that arent existent in house

because of this ending, in which he leaves the institution and will return to the hospital, i can assume that everything (or most of it) will go back to the way it was in prior seasons. ie him being a faggot to everyone, yet resolving the toughest of cases, and in my opinion, he will go back to consuming vicodin

what are your thoughts on the season premiere? how do you think the season will develop? (HOUSE FANBOYS (TAHAROK AND SENSORED) ANSWER)</description>

<p>has there ever been an episode in which we see house cry other than this one? no</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>ps taharok, i watched the series too. you dont have to write a whole summary of it<br>
and @ your comment towards the episode of the guy with the gun: even though at the end he did show SOME remorse for almost killing thirteen, that didnt stop him from giving the guy back his gun and risking thirteen’s life. meaning that his need to solve puzzles is greater than his care for other people</p>
<p><span class="mention">@your</span> comment towards episode of foreman’s illness: he obviously had regret for that because after all, it was house’s fault that foreman even had to go to the house and investigate, which is where he was infected. after all, its not like house is not human. he obviously shows signs of depression when one of his employees, of which he sees practically every day and works with, is about to die.</p>
<p>my statement had nothing to do with house caring about death, since that is acceptable. it was about opening up so quickly to this german milf and creating a relationship so fast</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>this. Most people see House as a total asshole and end it there, but if you really watch the episodes carefully, you’ll see that he does care.</p>
<p>Season 1 started off by showing a brilliant doctor who has every negative look on life you possibly can. He has probably read every major religious book, as he is able to quote any religious script in any context throughout all the seasons, yet he is completely oblivious to every religion. This portrays a man who doesn’t care about anything but solving the puzzle of his case (as we have learned from Cameron and others throughout that first season).</p>
<p>However, when you start to make it to the end of Season 1, you do see a different side of House. You see that he really does care what happens to the patient. On numerous occasions he has risked his medical license to save a patient. And if you watched all the house episodes, you may recall the one where Cuddy confronted House about his medical license being practically the only thing he cared about in life. In truth, he cares more about his colleagues and patients than his license, but the only thing that keeps him sane is his intelligence (which proved not to be enough by the last few episodes of Season 5 :P).</p>
<p>But of course, you’re abraham, so I need to give a few more examples. In one of the early Season 1 episodes, House almost gets fired by that billionaire who became the CEO of the hospital. Of course, he intentionally pissed of the man, but that led to something that did cause him to rethink his actions. When the CEO was asking for House’s dismissal, Wilson was the only one who defended him. Thus, the CEO called for Wilson’s resignation from the Hospital. When House found out, it seemed that he sincerely cared about what had happened, even if it would have happened had he went through the same situation all over again.</p>
<p>In episode nine (I believe) of season 5, there is that one man (who plays in Heroes) with the gun. He takes hostage a bunch of people in the clinic and causes them all to sit tight in Cuddy’s office as House and 13 diagnose him. Since the very first shot, the man wanted House to use the medicines he was going to receive on other patients he took hostage. Even though one of the patients suggested that 13 take on of the medicines, House tried to protect her (even though that particular syringe had a knockout drug). Even when the hostage taker had 13 try almost every drug to the end of the episode, House did his best to prevent her from taking anymore.</p>
<p>Here’s yet another example. In season 2 of House, Foreman catches a very deadly illness from that one policeman who had uncontrollable laughing in the beginning of the first episode (this particular case made up 2 episodes). After Foreman was diagnosed with the same symptoms as the policeman’s early symptoms, House started to grow weary. He was short-tempered to anyone who challenged him. He yelled at Wilson about being lucky that his employees can’t get cancer when getting too close to his patients, and that he could even sleep with them and likely not catch anything. House was quite “emotional” in both of these episodes.</p>
<p>And just because I like making really long posts, I’ll provide a final example. In the end of season 4, House spends every one of his efforts to try and save Amber. At any cost, he was going to save her. He even risked have electricity being directly shot on one of his brain cortexes to stimulate his subconscious memory, just so he could remember what happened. After recalling what had happened in the Bus accident, House had a seizure which resulted in a brain bleed. He could have lost his consciousness indefinitely, and he knew that risk before he even went through the operation. He took the risk of loosing his life to try to save someone he once called a “cutthroat bitch” throughout the early episodes of season 4. He did something brave for Wilson and someone he seemingly didn’t like very much.</p>
<p>Now that I have supported my point with too many examples, it’s your turn. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>You can’t not care about anyone, otherwise you’d most likely be suicidal.

              <p>I think you misinterpreted the episode slightly, as a house fanatic since season 1 I know pretty much everything about the show, and this is just what it needed, by the end of season 5 people were getting bored of the same old, so they threw in a twist. If you think they could get away with him remaining as he was any longer you’re mistook. People had started to get bored, the show had to change and that’s exactly what it has done.</p>
<p>House isn’t a one dimensional character, a show with such a character would be crap. That episode proved he WAS human; he might slide back, he might not. That’s the beauty of House as an individual - you have no idea what he’s going to do next. It showed him in a whole range of emotions while still remaining himself - even at the end he is depressed and miserable yet his doctor thinks he is better.</p>
<p>My point being he could change, or he’ll probably go back but we don’t know when or how or why. It’s obvious he’ll never be happy, that theme has been driven through every season since the 1st. This episode was one of the best yet, it proved he’s the centre piece of the show and there is no real need for the others - I could happily sit back and watch a full season of him in that psychiatric hospital.</p>
<p>Surprised no-one noticed the similarities between Lydia and Stacy. Watch it again, you’ll be impressed. This episode was genius.</p>
