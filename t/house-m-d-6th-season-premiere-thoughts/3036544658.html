<blockquote>
<p>I remember him being at least touched by the autistic kid who gave him his PSP. House is a classic example of a tough guy with a small heart. He acts as if he doesn’t care, but he really does.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>this. Most people see House as a total asshole and end it there, but if you really watch the episodes carefully, you’ll see that he does care.</p>
<p>Season 1 started off by showing a brilliant doctor who has every negative look on life you possibly can. He has probably read every major religious book, as he is able to quote any religious script in any context throughout all the seasons, yet he is completely oblivious to every religion. This portrays a man who doesn’t care about anything but solving the puzzle of his case (as we have learned from Cameron and others throughout that first season).</p>
<p>However, when you start to make it to the end of Season 1, you do see a different side of House. You see that he really does care what happens to the patient. On numerous occasions he has risked his medical license to save a patient. And if you watched all the house episodes, you may recall the one where Cuddy confronted House about his medical license being practically the only thing he cared about in life. In truth, he cares more about his colleagues and patients than his license, but the only thing that keeps him sane is his intelligence (which proved not to be enough by the last few episodes of Season 5 :P).</p>
<p>But of course, you’re abraham, so I need to give a few more examples. In one of the early Season 1 episodes, House almost gets fired by that billionaire who became the CEO of the hospital. Of course, he intentionally pissed of the man, but that led to something that did cause him to rethink his actions. When the CEO was asking for House’s dismissal, Wilson was the only one who defended him. Thus, the CEO called for Wilson’s resignation from the Hospital. When House found out, it seemed that he sincerely cared about what had happened, even if it would have happened had he went through the same situation all over again.</p>
<p>In episode nine (I believe) of season 5, there is that one man (who plays in Heroes) with the gun. He takes hostage a bunch of people in the clinic and causes them all to sit tight in Cuddy’s office as House and 13 diagnose him. Since the very first shot, the man wanted House to use the medicines he was going to receive on other patients he took hostage. Even though one of the patients suggested that 13 take on of the medicines, House tried to protect her (even though that particular syringe had a knockout drug). Even when the hostage taker had 13 try almost every drug to the end of the episode, House did his best to prevent her from taking anymore.</p>
<p>Here’s yet another example. In season 2 of House, Foreman catches a very deadly illness from that one policeman who had uncontrollable laughing in the beginning of the first episode (this particular case made up 2 episodes). After Foreman was diagnosed with the same symptoms as the policeman’s early symptoms, House started to grow weary. He was short-tempered to anyone who challenged him. He yelled at Wilson about being lucky that his employees can’t get cancer when getting too close to his patients, and that he could even sleep with them and likely not catch anything. House was quite “emotional” in both of these episodes.</p>
<p>And just because I like making really long posts, I’ll provide a final example. In the end of season 4, House spends every one of his efforts to try and save Amber. At any cost, he was going to save her. He even risked have electricity being directly shot on one of his brain cortexes to stimulate his subconscious memory, just so he could remember what happened. After recalling what had happened in the Bus accident, House had a seizure which resulted in a brain bleed. He could have lost his consciousness indefinitely, and he knew that risk before he even went through the operation. He took the risk of loosing his life to try to save someone he once called a “cutthroat bitch” throughout the early episodes of season 4. He did something brave for Wilson and someone he seemingly didn’t like very much.</p>
<p>Now that I have supported my point with too many examples, it’s your turn. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/greeny-2.html">@Greeny</a>: of course he cared about stacy, but did he care for anything else other than the things ive stated? no. did he ever <span class="bbcode-b">show</span> that he cared for any of his patients? (yes their may be exceptions, but in general) no</p>
<p>has there ever been an episode in which we see house cry other than this one? no</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>ps taharok, i watched the series too. you dont have to write a whole summary of it<br>
and @ your comment towards the episode of the guy with the gun: even though at the end he did show SOME remorse for almost killing thirteen, that didnt stop him from giving the guy back his gun and risking thirteen’s life. meaning that his need to solve puzzles is greater than his care for other people</p>
<p><span class="mention">@your</span> comment towards episode of foreman’s illness: he obviously had regret for that because after all, it was house’s fault that foreman even had to go to the house and investigate, which is where he was infected. after all, its not like house is not human. he obviously shows signs of depression when one of his employees, of which he sees practically every day and works with, is about to die.</p>
<p>my statement had nothing to do with house caring about death, since that is acceptable. it was about opening up so quickly to this german milf and creating a relationship so fast</p>
