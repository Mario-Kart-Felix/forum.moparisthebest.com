              <p>itâ€™s probably the UID, search for UID in your client class and remove if you can that entire piece of code OR!! comment out the disconnecting part of kicked part.<br>
another option is that all the packets have been changed so only client which has matching packets can log in , but this is really unlikely.</p>
