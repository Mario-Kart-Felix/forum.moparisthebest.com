    <title>Anybody play golf here?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anybody-play-golf-here/205218</link>
    <description>This is probably the last place to ask. But I&#39;m pretty desperate to fix my swing. I can&#39;t figure out why I&#39;m sliceing my driver a little bit. I thought it was my down swing. But it&#39;s on the right angle. I was told my balance is off, but it&#39;s just fine. I can upload another video if you need another angle.

So if you know anything about golf, I&#39;d appreciate help. :)</description>

I enjoy playing golf, but I don’t have some sort of fetish. The game is entertaining. More of a leisurely thing for me to do, rather than play for sport.<br>

<p>Lets keep on-topic :p. I flatened my swing out a bit, to keep on plane. I’ll see if it works at practice tommorow.</p>
<p>Th4t0n36uy, please don’t post in here…I didn’t want this to turn into an arguement.</p>

<p>I did expect somebody to say something, but it happens I guess.</p>
<p>Chiz, my coach told me it was my hips. My balance is a little off, thus making the ball to slice a bit. I’m not rotating my hips enough, and it’s making the ball slice. Also, I haven’t had a lesson is over three years :p. Just help here and there, but it’s mainly on my own.</p>

But it’s on the right angle. I was told my balance is off, but it’s just fine. I can upload another video if you need another angle.</p>
