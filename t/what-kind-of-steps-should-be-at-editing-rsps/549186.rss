              <p>Are you working from a blank base?</p>
<p>If not, this is what I would do…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Forming a team</span><br>
Would you rather would byyourself? or with a team? make that decision and be careful who you choose to be on your team, as some are plain out jaggs.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Economy</span><br>
Stabilize economy, make sure that the economy can hold its own. What I mean by that is that players have to be self sufficient and there has to be certain items that can only be bought from drops, or by making it. Ex. Nature runes, rune knives. Take those out of the shops then implement the system of drops.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Donator areas/shop</span></p>
<p>You’re going to want donators I’m assuming unless you can fund the server without the help of others. A donator shop would be nice as it provides motivation to donate. Donator only areas are also really nice. here is an example from my sever.</p>
<p><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img673/9203/TGRvqX.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Website</span><br>
A website is key and so are forums so players can keep up to date with the server, and communicate with other players about certain topics.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Vote system, auto donation</span><br>
Voting is very essential in making your server popular, auto donation is also nice to have as it makes things easier for players.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Own unique features</span></p>
<p>Own custom items, custom minigames, custom bosses, quests, anything to make your server stand out</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Final touches</span><br>
Anything you can think of bug fixes, dupe fixes, shop assortments, buying vps ect ect…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Release</span></p>
<p>Advertise away, make sure you have an adequate gfx designer to make you a somewhat decent banner.</p>
<p>This is just my opinion what I did and what worked for me, starting from a blank base is completely different.</p>
