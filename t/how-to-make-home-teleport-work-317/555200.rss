    <title>How to make Home teleport work 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-home-teleport-work-317/555200</link>
    <description>I changed the 5 teleports it originally had to 3, but now that i changed the Option5* to Option3* it won&#39;t teleport to the location when i click on one of the three buttons i put it to.

How can i make it so that i tell Option3 to teleport to Yanille when the option &quot;Yanille&quot; is clicked? This is [PI] 317</description>
