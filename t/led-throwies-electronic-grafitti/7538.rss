    <title>LED Throwies (Electronic Grafitti)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/led-throwies-electronic-grafitti/7538</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;An LED throwie is a small, battery-powered light, attached to a magnet (usually with conductive epoxy or electrical tape), used for the purpose of creating graffiti and light displays. They were devised by the Graffiti Research Lab as a new kind of graffiti art to be used on ferromagnetic surfaces. Part of GRL&#39;s original campaign involved distributing throwies to a group of people, who were then encouraged to throw them onto a metal sculpture, called Alamo, located at Astor Place on the isle of Manhattan in New York City.

The low cost of materials and the ease with which throwies can be constructed have led to concern over their potential environmental impact. Namely, that the spent Throwies would not later be collected and eventually the lithium batteries would leak. While the devices are single use, they can be collected later so that the LEDs and magnets can be reused and the batteries can be disposed of properly. Also, IEC LR series batteries can be used instead which pose no environmental risks (other than litter).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>What I don’t understand is this: where’s the art form? You’re just attaching LEDs to a battery and (is there a magnet? I didn’t read the whole thing) sticking it to something else. To me, grafitti is where you actually take time and creativity to make something look good.</p>
<p>These are just blinky?</p>
