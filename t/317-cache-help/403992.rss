    <title>317 cache help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-cache-help/403992</link>
    <description>Since I don&#39;t have the required means to turn my client into a webclient, I was thinking of an alternative solution.

Is there a way I could make this occur : 
1. Force the client to download cache into C:/ directory.
2. Client will request cache from the directory specified ( the c: drive ) everytime.

Essentially what I want to do is make that occur ^ and then compress my client into its jar format. When people would download my jar it would download the cache into their C:/ directory when they ran the jar. Then everytime the jar would start up after that, it would see if ive made any updates to the cache and re-download it. Of course I also need it to access the cache from C:/ and nowhere else.

If anyone knows what files I would need to alter and how to alter them, it would be a great help.</description>
