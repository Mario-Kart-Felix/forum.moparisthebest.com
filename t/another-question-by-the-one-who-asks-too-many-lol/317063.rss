              <p>Its been a while… okay uhm, go into your client.java, and search up Buy 10 for example or something like that. There will be some sort of code confirming it will buy 10 of that item like, you will see something like “if = 10” or w.e. Change that number to what you want it to be. Now changing the frame of it Idk, it will stay say “buy 10” but it will actually be the number you changed it to. Hope this helped.</p>
