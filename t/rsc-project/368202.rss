    <description>Hello guys,

About me :

My name is Mike, I am 18 im in College for Web development. Im usually free, I work full time. But always have a computer with me.

Project :

I would like to make a RSC Server for people who love RSC and to let them enjoy the good old days. So basically same rates as real rs, no cutoms ect..

What I have :

I have 2 dedicated computers, one for the server, one for the website

I have vbulletin forums, and a custom homepage already done up, I also will buy a .com domain

Extra money to help out.

So basically I have everything we need, I just dont want to do everything myself.

We will add strip of safe zone under wilderness with portal and bankchest so people can still use wilderness if they wish. All around towns will be 3 levels difference pvp.</p>

              <p>I wouldnt really bother trying to recreate rsc as there is already rsce… I would look to a different angle on the game and try something people havent seen/been around in a while…</p>
<p>For instance an all out war server where everywhere is wilderness but items/skills still need to be trained and gained.<br>
Or a chaos server in which you have too teams - players choose when signing up - and have defendable territories and they must compete to win training grounds…</p>
<p>Trying to compete against an already established server with only a limited amount of players is like trying to wank yourself off using a knife…</p>
<p>Also with you having your own systems the 14 year old kids in this place will ddos you because they have no lives and think they are badass interz netz hakarz!</p>
<p>Hey but i could be wrong and you may just prove me to be.</p>
<p>Goodluck <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
