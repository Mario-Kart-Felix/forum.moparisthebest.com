    <description>Ok so i wanted to try the green dragon killing thing for money and they was about 14players. im combat 97 + 4 (101) so i was able to kill 12 outa the 14 players cuz i one 73 and other wasnt botting. i got 208 dragon bones 580k. I killed the players very quick with ice barrage. If u have high combat and no money do this its very very easy and it fixs the bot problem also if u wait 30mins they will all be their again</description>

I’ve known about bot killing, but I’ve never thought about doing it because I don’t really have the player killing stats. I have 85 attk, 86 str, 86 hp, 82 def, 60 prayer</p>
