    <title>The updated b3n download list :d</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-updated-b3n-download-list-d/187355</link>
    <description>Ok i have gone out of my way to make allot of these only 1 is leeched and Command Maker on my last list of of downloads i only provided 3 downloadeds now since its been updated there is more! :eek: 
And This is a promise ;D, no virus&#39;s or spyware what so ever!! So Please stop flaming &quot;oh this has a virus&quot; obviously when you said that you didn&#39;t have a clue what you were talking about...  :mad: anyways as you download any of these you will notice these run more smoothly than regular pre-downloaded voules and server runners like on when you download a source these are faster, check them out ;) 
I Also Have Java Files Aswell For People Who Like Scar Scipts And Such..

ok this one was the first ever one i made... its &quot;an all in one&quot; or as i like to call it a &quot;perfect package&quot; this covers everything from server runners voules command maker etc, this is a tad bit buggy only about 2 of them dont work as i recall which was the command maker thats why i made another one with less bugs but anyway heres the first one [url=http://rapidshare.com/files/98003638/bensallinone.bat.html]http://rapidshare.com/files/98003638/bensallinone.bat.html [/url]

Here Is The LEECHED command maker that DOES work no bugs.. this is just an extra feature for servers so you dont need to delete anything from your server for this handy tool heres the link&gt;&gt; [url=http://rapidshare.com/files/98004279/b3nscommandmaker.bat.html]http://rapidshare.com/files/98004279/b3nscommandmaker.bat.html[/url]

ok the third one that i ever made also one of my faves is the &quot;perfect compiler&quot; this runs your server and makes the jar files but you need JDK 5.0 or 6.0 (dont ask me for the link!) [url=http://rapidshare.com/files/98004755/bensperfectcompiler.bat.html]http://rapidshare.com/files/98004755/bensperfectcompiler.bat.html[/url] 

ok now time for the forth bat file :D which was the server runner works allot faster and provides less lag, if that don&#39;t work your pc is not very good..
[url=http://rapidshare.com/files/98005206/b3nsserverrunner.bat.html]http://rapidshare.com/files/98005206/b3nsserverrunner.bat.html[/url]

Now time for the two voules the only difference with the second one it runs faster than the first one, well i think so.. try it yourself!
[url=http://rapidshare.com/files/98005425/b3nsvoule.bat.html]http://rapidshare.com/files/98005425/b3nsvoule.bat.html[/url]
And the second...

Now Time For Scripts These were leeched ones but theres not allot of links going around of this 
practically all the credit goes to people who made it i just renamed it after me
