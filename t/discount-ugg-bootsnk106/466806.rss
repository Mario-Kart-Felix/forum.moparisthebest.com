New York (CNN) -- After his state&#39;s coastline took the brunt of Superstorm Sandy, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Friday [url=http://www.cooluggsclearance.com][b]www.cooluggsclearance.com[/b][/url] that he expects power to be almost fully restored statewide by Saturday night.&quot;Life will be [url=http://www.cooluggsclearance.com][b]uggs for cheap[/b][/url] back -- for most of New Jersey -- to normal come Sunday,&quot; he told reporters.More than 175,000 households in the Garden State are still in the dark, and homes with saltwater electrical damage will have to be inspected by electricians before having their power restored.&quot;Some of those homes have already been disconnected,&quot; said Chris Eck, a spokesman Jersey Central Power &amp; Light, the state&#39;s second largest power provider. &quot;We can&#39;t energize the circuit until we know the system is safe.&quot;Christie&#39;s comments came after a tour of the [url=http://www.discountuggssold.com][b]ugg boots sale[/b][/url] Jersey shore, where Superstorm Sandy ravaged homes and business.

&quot;Much of the iconic boardwalk is buckled and much of the piers are out to sea,&quot; he said. &quot;The shore and boardwalk in [url=http://www.realqualityofuggs.com][b]uggs sale[/b][/url] Seaside Heights of my childhood no longer exists.&quot;&quot;This is our Katrina,&quot; the governor added.To the north, some 20,000 households across New York City and Westchester County remained without power. Another 150,000 homes in Long Island and harder-hit areas of Queens, such as Rockaway Peninsula, were also in the dark after the double blow of Sandy and this week&#39;s nor&#39;easter.But in an attempt to deal with persistently long gas lines, New York police started enforcing [url=http://www.realqualityofuggs.com][b]www.realqualityofuggs.com[/b][/url] a new alternating fuel [url=http://www.cooluggsclearance.com][b]cheap ugg[/b][/url] ration system on Friday.
