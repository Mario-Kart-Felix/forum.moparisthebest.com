    <title>PI based server, Creating a commands list</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-based-server-creating-a-commands-list/344124</link>
    <description>Hello,

I have recently moved onto a new based server, and ive converted a commands list from delta to project insaity. Im having a problem with one part though. When i get to the end of the list, the list keeps going and says qj1 etc. In delta you would flushout the system. But im not sure what i would put to stop that from happeneing on a PI based server.


Help me please

Thank you for reading</description>
