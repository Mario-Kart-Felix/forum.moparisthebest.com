              <p>Things he probably done:</p>
<p>Added character-file writing for it.<br>
(It saves in the characters file: Pking skill = ?)</p>
<p>Replaced the sprites.<br>
(In the cache you can replace the pking icon with what you want it to be)</p>
<p>Possibly replaced another skill.<br>
(yes, maybe removed summoning/ rewrote?)</p>
<p>Check all the skills you know of that don’t refer to a packet, than search through Player.java or Client.java maybe even PlayerAssistant.java , try removing every case of it AS LONG AS you know it isn’t something major, or isn’t needed for another purpose.</p>
<p>hope it helps.</p>
