    <title>When ever I click &quot;(playername)Wishes to trade with you&quot; it doesn&#39;t work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/when-ever-i-click-playername-wishes-to-trade-with-you-it-doesnt-work/454614</link>
    <description>I send a trade request normally but it doesn&#39;t seem to open the interface? I read around somewhere that changing the packethandler ID thingy from 139 to 39 or the other way round would work, but now when I right click trading follows.

So simplify things. Do you have a fix for :
A) Clicking &quot;(playername) wishes to trade with you&quot;.
or 
B) Changing Following to trade with. (Clicking follow trades and trade with follows)

Sorry if it doesn&#39;t make sense :P</description>
