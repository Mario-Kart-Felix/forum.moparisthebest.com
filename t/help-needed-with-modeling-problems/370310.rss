    <description>Hi, this is my first time adding models to a client, and im having some difficulty. Help would be lovely, and i would rep you or whatever you want.

so here&#39;s the story.

Trying to make a custom whip. i already colored them, both wield and drop models, and compiled them with 7z so they were rar files. I then put them into the clients models folder, added the correct ints into class 8, and compiled my client. So far so good. I went on the server with the client, and i typed add model 13000 (the wield model). It said couldn&#39;t find the model and dc&#39;d me. I was told this was ok so i typed add model 13001 (the drop model), same thing happened. Then i tried to spawn the item using ::pickup 9000 1 (the item id of the whip as indicated in the int&#39;s). And it spawned into my inventory.... a banner. i could wield it to my right hand, but it was definitely not the model of the whip i had created. So i tried changing the name of the models to a lower number that was not taken, and in the int&#39;s as well as the model folder, the wield model was now 9100 and the drop model was now 9101. so i compiled, went on the server, added the models, spawned the item, and this time it added a wieldable shovel into my inventory. if anyone knows how to solve this please let me know, i will do anything to get the answer.

All the best,
