    <title>Hey, need some help with my god swords?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hey-need-some-help-with-my-god-swords/235115</link>
    <description>Hey, 1st of thank for taking the time to look at my topic.

Ok, well im having a little trouble with the god swords on my server, im using a deltascape soure.
A week or two ago, i posted a topic about shop problems, and after i got all that sorted out, all the god swords on my server lost all of there stats, and show up as a non-existing item in the second trade screen.

I have tried reverting to backup shops, but its still doesn&#39;t work?


Little confused on why this happened, any help is highly appreciated. But please, no flaming.
