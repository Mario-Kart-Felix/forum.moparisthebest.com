    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webpage-requests/408882</link>
    <description>ok. i made a program to send requests to the GE page to collect data. it goes fine through the first two requests and the third one it times out or something. there is an at least 10 second waiting period between requests. am i not giving it long enough, between requests to that site?

idk if its something with my program or if its on jagexs part. also would it be better to just collect the data from the cache? all im getting from the GE page is the item id, and the description, but i can only get trade-able item info from the GE. what all would i have to do to read the jagex cache. im wanting to get a list of all the trade-able items and a couple of others(basically every item possible to be dropped by a monster.) and add them to a database. its for a future project im going to be working on in my free time.

i just remembered about on some of the older ps clients i used b4 had a java app that read a items xml file(which would only contain older items).</description>

<p>lol. im pretty sure i could rewrite it in java but it seems like a little bit of a waste since i think im just going to run it once and probably never run it again. plus its inserting the data in a MSSQL database so idk what all i would have to do to get java connected to a MSSQL server <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> idk if that would be hard or not.</p>
<p>edit: woot i solved it. did some searching for something that wasnt the fix but it lead me to the solution. i never closed my response streams so that was my problem.</p>

              <p>well the only reason im using the GE site is b/c i has the id, name and description. im not collecting the prices.</p>
<p>i can post the code if u want to look at it but its in <a href="http://vb.net" rel="nofollow noopener">vb.net</a> so if thats cool ill post it. im just using vb b/c its seems quick, simple and easy to write up simple, minimally use programs like this one. the only reason im creating this program was to collect info from RS and RuneHQ and add it to a DB i am building.</p>
