    <title>Moparscape Eats a Hamburger</title>

    <description>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaf6zF-FJBk&amp;feature=watch_response_rev

In the video, Andy Warhol eats a hamburger. Critics, linguists, psychs, and other artists from all over the world go to incredible footholds in order to express what exactly Warhol meant in this video. Warhol has said himself, that the video is completely pointless.

This brings me to thinking, there are infinite variables that rest in a final product, but no one ever truly knows the meaning behind it besides the artist themselves; artist being the creator. An artist should take hold of their work, as their own. They are not expecting any sort of particular response, unless the purpose of his/her work is to form a response. There are no true meanings behind anything at all, because it is whatever you make it.

This being said, this community is whatever you make it. There is, of course, the obvious premise of being a RSPS forum. But beyond the content, you contribute to this community with every post. You cannot control what other users mean in their posts, only your own. So when you think about the status of this community, perhaps view the depth of your own posts. You influence every critic in this community, and the critics are us.</description>

To show, that things are what you make of it, so saying thing like ‘Moparscape is shit’ is just contributing to everybody treating as so. Things are what you make of it, but the true meaning is in the artist himself.</p>
