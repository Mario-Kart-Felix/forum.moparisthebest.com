    <title>I seem to be a bit confused</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-seem-to-be-a-bit-confused/97463</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been looking through the source codes of different Private Servers, but I can&#39;t seem to make sense out of a few things.

One of them is how the colon codes work. I&#39;m yet to find anything in there that defines the actions of the various colon commands.

Another thing is why it has both the Java files and the CLASS files? Is this just so we can learn what&#39;s going on when, by reading the Java files?

One more question,

How much Java would a person need to learn to make his or her own private server? A good amount, or is it mostly just cutting and pasting different lines of code?

Please write back!

              <p>The colon codes. Where you type like- <span class="bbcode-i">::help</span> to get a list of the commands and such that people make up. Where does the maker of the server define what each code does? Like in one server, if you type in “::fish” it takes you to the fountain in varrock (the small one) to fish that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I know what CLASS files are, and I know you need them to make a Java applet work right, but why does the source to the private servers have both Java files <span class="bbcode-b">and</span> CLASS files?</p>
<p>On the last; what would a Level 4 tutorial be? What site do you base it off of? (Each site’s gotta be different, right?)</p>

              <p>ok, first, idk what you mean on your 1st question, but the second is, the class files usually run the server right, and last, you dont need that much knowlege, you just need to be able to do at leaste a lvl4 tutorial good and you can do a server really good <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
