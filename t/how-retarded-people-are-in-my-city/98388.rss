    <description>Just saw it on the news, people attach chains to their car, then to pay phones, and rip the pay phone off of the poll/wall and take it home, get the money out of it, and keep it.

Amazingly you get like $300+ from each one but still, like what the fuck?</description>

              <p>i was at an amusement park once, and i put in my dollar and tried to hack the machine (by putting in my dollar, pressing a letter, and then pressing the coin return slot (should give you back the dollar, but my machine was old) and after gettting the dollar you press the last number/letter and you should get the item for free.) but it didn’t work. i walked away and about 2 min later, i look over and the machine is spitting out like $50 in quarters. it was insane!</p>

<p>They do that here too. Except all they do is shove toilet paper up the coin return slot.</p>
<p>My community in general is stupid. It was designed to be a retirement town, but I guess at the same time there are a lot of kids. There’s no recreation here which probably explains why we have the largest drug per capita in my province. Well people here are so stupid that they recently voted the same mayor back. There hasn’t been a road paved for over 5 years. And believe me, the roads are in horrible condition. He also just brought us to a 13 million dollar debt(I think that was it, my memory is a little foggy). Thats a pretty bad debt considering our population is 14,000.</p>
