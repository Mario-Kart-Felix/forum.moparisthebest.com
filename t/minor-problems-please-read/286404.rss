    <description>Hello ervyone, me again.
I&#39;ve recently had some trouble with Vengeance and the special bar
Firstly, i&#39;m using PwnScape source, the vengeance delays for some reason
I was testing the combo and it did the red skull, but didn&#39;t say &quot;Taste Vengeance!&quot;. But 2 hits later it did it, I didn&#39;t even use the Vengeance again it just was like a delay.
Here&#39;s my code for the vengeance:
	}
                           client player = (client) server.playerHandler.players[playerId];
                           if (mage.vengon &amp;&amp; hitDiff != 0 &amp;&amp; !splash) {
                                player.hitDiff = (int)(hitDiff / 1.3); // Simple math, 100 divided by 1.30, and you get 76.
				player.currentHealth -= (int)(hitDiff / 1.3);
                                player.hitUpdateRequired = true; // So the hit will append to you.
                                player.updateRequired = true; // So the hit will append to you.
                                player.appearanceUpdateRequired = true; // So the hit will append to you.
                                mage.vengon = false;
                                mage.plrText = &quot;Taste vengeance!&quot;; // This says it in itself.
                                mage.plrTextUpdateRequired = true; // Make sure the txt4 will update.
                            }

also I have a spec bar delay, i&#39;m sure many have this problem and have fixed it, if anyone knows how to fix it please post.

Thanks!</description>
