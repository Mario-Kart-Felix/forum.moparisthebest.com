              <p>Having 10 rep plus having it locked is supposed to be a punishment and is supposed to show that the person who has it deserves no respect at all. It doesn’t matter if “rep doesn’t matter”, it’s suppose to send that statement.</p>

I have discovered that most people want 10 rep now because it is the new fashion. Apparently, people don’t want to abuse to get to 10, so they simply ask us to do it for them. This is a new fashion that has been started by non other than <span class="bbcode-b">krackkid</span>, so if we want someone to blame I say we ban krackkid.<br>

No you stupid troll, that solves nothing.<br>
Krackkid keeps a level of balance here, and without him, I’m sure a number of people would go on some form of strike, or it would be general chaos.</p>

<p>krackkid didn’t start a trend by any means… he was just being him.

<p>Krackkid keeps balance? In what, stupidity? No offense but I’ve notice quite a considerable increase stupidity involved in posts ever since people started following his forum etiquette.</p>
