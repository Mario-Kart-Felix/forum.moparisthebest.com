    <title>Removing fences</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/removing-fences/356674</link>
    <description>Alright, so I was wondering if anyone could help me remove peices of fence, it isn&#39;t a square object, so I can&#39;t use &quot;deletethatobject&quot; and I was already told it was in the cache. So I was just wondering if you could tell me how to remove about 4 peice of fence from my game, the exact fence peices are the two peice left of the camelot castle gate and the two peices to the right of the gate.</description>

              <p>No, it isn’t the “deletethatobject” void. It’s in the cache, client sided. The fence isn’t on a x, y axis anyways. Still need help on how to remove them though.</p>

              <p>Well this is server-sided, and it will be “public void Deletewalls() {”.<br>
deletethatwall(XXXX, YYYY);</p>
<p>You’ll probably have to play around with the coords figuring out which side deletes which wall.</p>
