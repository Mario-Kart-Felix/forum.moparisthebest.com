    <title>[HELP] 718+ Servers [HELP]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-718-servers-help/538446</link>
    <description>Hello, I am tired of messing with all of these RSPS Help pages where nobody helps you or knows how to help you. I am now willing to pay you Via PayPal to help me start my server as a simple local host. Easy right? Good luck to the one who tries. PM ME if you want to try and help.
I do have TeamViewer so you can see why I need help with something so &quot;simple&quot;.

*FOR THE STAFF*
Now I am sure this is going to get locked or something, why though? If I request help I get none, if I don&#39;t nothing happens. Money is apparently the only way to motivate somebody. So if you see and lock this, go fuck yourself and at least direct me into the right path.</description>

You have to give more information for us to help you. Are you trying to just log on yourself? If so you have to tell us what revision your client is for us to direct you to the correct place.</p>
