    <title>[HELP] Adapting to Java</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-adapting-to-java/539152</link>
    <description>[center][size=21pt]New to MoparScape![/size][/center]
[hr]
[center]Introduction[/center]

     Alright, hello everyone I am going to save us all some time by saying that I am not new to [i]RuneScape Private Servers[/i] just outdated. I am new to the language of [i]Java[/i] though. I practiced it on 317 Delta&#39;s and All-star a few years back and got pretty good. I moved to PI and it seemed the same just a bit more to it, so I didn&#39;t stay long before I skipped to 508+. I am not here to be a [u]leecher[/u] by no means, I want to learn more about [i]RSPS&#39;s[/i] and [i]The Java Language[/i].
[hr]
[center]On Point Purpose[/center]

     I am coming to you, to ask you a favor; if any of you out there could point me into the path of a nice RSPS Base server. Good to start off of, to start a project with and possibly to host online for others to enjoy just as much as I enjoyed making it. As the introduction says, I went to PI... but I never truly stuck with it to learn its potential, if any. I was thinking about going back, if you guys think it&#39;s worth it to make a project out of it. If not, that is perfectly fine, I just may need someone&#39;s guidance though [url=http://&#39;SwiftTic&#39; is my skype]Skype[/url] maybe.
[hr]
[center]What I Plan to Have For Final Production[/center]

[center]I plan to have; 
*A fully updated and working gameframe with MoneyPouch/PriceCheck, Summoning, Experience, Worldmap, Hitpoints, Prayer, Run, Logout, and a customized Staff Button.
*All Tabs working perfectly without lag or duplication, and a custom &#39;member&#39; tab.
*All skills working 100% including Summoning(BoB at least), Hunter, and Dungeoneering with a custom &#39;Trust&#39; skill.
*A custom quest tab with my own custom WELL DEVELOPED quests. &lt;-- This is my strong point.
*A more in depth Settings Interface/Fully working Report Abuse System/Call Staff Interface.
*Clan Chat fully working with Kicking/Banning/Auto Join.
*718 Graphic&#39;s if possible, with all the new items &amp; stats.
*Fully working Grand Exchange/Banking/Trading/Lending/Request Assistance.
*Custom PkP Exchange, Vote Exchange, Loyalty Points, and Server Points.
*All Mini-games including Clan Wars, Warrior&#39;s Guild, Duel Arena, Bounty Hunter, Soul Wars, 63 Waves of Jad, Pest Control, Fishing Trawler, Agility games, Custom Slayer games and my custom mini-game(after a year of planning).
*Perfect Combat with NPC&#39;s and Players. (No idea how to edit combat.)
*All Bosses 100% with cut-sceens if possible including; Nex, Godwars, Corporal Beast, and all others I am not familiar with.
*Developing a stable economy, (I am familiar with how economy&#39;s works so this is not a problem.)
*Fully working lobby if possible.
*Fully working Auras, maybe compatible with adding custom items like Halo&#39;s.
*All area&#39;s and NPC&#39;s spawned and look-a-like&#39;s to RuneScape.
*Right Click Report option.
*Custom fight option, as if you were to get into a fight in real life.
*Fully working Random Events to stop all botters/afk players.

*UPDATED WHEN THOUGHT OF MORE*


I am not asking to leech this stuff by no means, I have a lot more than this to do to a server. But if there is a good source out there with stuff like this, that would be amazing. (If given a PI, I would like a base and then a fully loaded PI source to check out some stuff and apply it.)[/center]

[center][size=18pt]Thanks so much to all of those who decide to help, please forgive me if I came across demanding.[/size][/center]</description>

<p>use pheonix or asteria, both of which can be found in the downloads section[/quote]That’s why I asked for whatever you guys think would be best for me.<br>
SideNote: I looked up both, found your post on Asteria, looks a bit deceiving but I might check it out. Pheonix was a 500+ and had no pictures or information.<br>
Thanks for helping me out though.</p>
