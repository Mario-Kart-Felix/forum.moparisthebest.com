    <title>Runescape in the years of 2001-2007</title>

    <description>Sup Mopar,
I made this topic because I actuelly have a question on why people are making RSPS private servers. I always thought that Runescape was the best in the years of 1995-2007. Some people are proving me wrong and some are proving me right. Actuelly I wanted to ask the people: Why are you guys making RSPS servers, because when I start making a RSPS server, I always think about the times that Runescape was fantastic! When the times it didn&#39;t lagg, the times when I loved the whip emote and the sales at Camelot Bank, the times I got scammed for 1 mil because I didnt see that the other player took his whip away and accepted very fast. I want those times back, most people on the server status page have an edited server, like chieving stalls behind the bank, or just modified places in Varrock or Lumbridge, I want a really nice server which includes almost all things and the economy of Runescape in the years 2001-2007, I hope someone will give me it, I will also help the people who wants to make this. Good Luck :)

Never knew that, but I do know they started developing Rs in late 99- early 2000. But didn’t host til january of 01, supposedly in the first 5 months they had around 3-4,000 people playing which is nice.</p>

Rs is evolving, you can’t let a game just sit in the same place for 5 years.<br>
Stop moaning its getting annoying now, yes Rs was fun back in those days but it needs to keep evolving or enjoy bankruptcy. Also, it should be aiming to get new players rather than reattract old players as it wants to expand not just sit there.</p>

I feel the same way I think Runescape was at thew perfection b4 the wild ditch were you could pk in the wild and right before the GE. The GE is veryu helpfull but is a bit “not needed” what you had to do was go to world 1 or 2 and spam like a bitch of what you needed in varrock.

              <p>I used to love those years, well 2005 - 2007, I was too young to be allowed to play online before '05, but yea.  Those couple years were the best, everyone talked, scams happened, but it made you feel like you were actually part of the game and that you meant something to the economy.</p>
<p>You used to have to work hard for the cash you had, spend 2 hours mining a few hundred iron ore, then taking them to the furnace and only having half come out as bars, then spending half an hour in front of falador bank trying to sell the bars.  Good times.</p>
<p>I remember when merching was actually dangerous, that if you didn’t pay attention you lost your stuff, and if you paid attention, you made tons of cash.  I remember when people would stand in the bank saying, selling archer ring 2m, then someone would say, buying archer ring 3.5m like 15 squares away.</p>
<p>That was a fun game, now it’s all simplified and turning into every other BAD game.</p>
<p>It still is fun, but it’s lost its competitiveness.</p>
