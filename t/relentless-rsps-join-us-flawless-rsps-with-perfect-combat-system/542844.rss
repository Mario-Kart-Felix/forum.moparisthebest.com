[LEFT]Relentless is a brand new server with the sole purpose to please our community’s members. This being said, we will listen to all of your ideas and requests and form the game upon those. Relentless RSPS offers a wide variety of choice and entertainment that provides a unique style of game-play for every single one of our players. We provide you with bug-free enjoyable content that intends to provide enjoyment to several types of players. The economy around Relentless is challengeable enough, which means you will need to work your way up for whatever you may desire.  [/LEFT]

[CENTER][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Ma1SWXV.png[/img][/CENTER]

We are an economy server, which means every item ingame is obtained either by PKING/PVM and you will have to work for it. This way our items will have value, making it more exciting and fun for our players to have something to aim for instead of getting everything for free and not lifting a finger. There are different ways of exchanging your items, we are using specific market areas, clan chats and a dedicated section on forums for this.

[CENTER][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/LPTw6Pe.png[/img][/CENTER]

All of Relentless’s staff are hand-picked based off applications and pre-work within the community, anyone is free to submit a staff application. These applications then get voted by all staff with the rank of Administrator and above, the few applicants providing us with the best applications will get a chance to prove themselves by starting off as a trial rank, Server Support. The staff managers will make sure we have staff covering all kind of time zones, but not only that, also having the best possible staff members available for you at all times. 


[CENTER][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/k9lv1dD.png[/img][/CENTER]

Our development team are well aware of that all major updates have to come from what the community wants and desire. Once you have become a part of our community you will notice regular updates and polls that covers this, giving you the opportunity to bring what you want and enjoy into the game. We also have a suggestions section on forums, post your ideas there and believe us, your voice will be heard and perhaps even implemented if your fellow players supports you. We will always strive to make our community satisfied.

[ul][*]FunPK: We have made this area for you to safely kill other players without losing your items, whenever you feel like pking without risking a dime, this is the minigame to go! You will have to purchase 500K gold to enter. 


[*]Warrior’s Guild: The classic warrior’s guild involving animating armors, you kill these for their tokens. The tokens are then used for the top floor for to defeat the Cyclops for their defenders. 


[*]Duel Arena: An arena made for the purpose to gamble others, we like to call it staking. You have different options of staking though, you can either choose to: Box, Mage-box, Range-box, DDS or Whip. Remember: Dueling is at your OWN risk! 


[*]Castle Wars: The aim of Castle Wars is to take the enemy&#39;s standard, or flag, from their castle and return it to the standard in your own castle&#39;s keep, gaining 1 point each time. Players must prevent the opposing team from taking your standard by defending your castle. This can be done by killing, or simply using barricades and other equipments.


[*]Fight Caves/Fight Pits: Jad, one of the strongest and most fearful bosses Relentless has to offer. Players will be rewarded with Tokkul for playing this minigame, and if they manage to defeat TzTok-Jad, they will be rewarded with the fire cape - the 6th strongest cape in the game after Ardougne cape, Spirit cape, TokHaar-Kal, Max cape and the Completionist cape.


[*]Pest Control: Nothing like going out protecting the Void Knight collecting points to save up for Void Armor. Or perhaps you want to obtain a fighter torso, barrow gloves among other things. Fully functional pest control allows you to do just do that.[/ul]

Here at Relentless we will always strive for optimal PKING activity. In order to accomplish that and maintain a high qualitative Wilderness for our players to enjoy, we have covered most of the areas with bosses/monsters where the drop rates will be slightly higher than other locations. Which means the chance of getting drops and making cash is bigger if you choose to PVM inside of the Wilderness, but at the same time it will be risky as players might attack you. 

We have more or less made our Combat system to perfection and are always focusing on improving it. You will notice that Relentless Player Killing has a lot to offer and that it is both enjoyable and rewarding at the same time to participate in our PKING events, whether it be FFA (Free for All) or any other event whatever it could be. Hybrid, Melee and Pure Tournaments will be hosted now and then, for you to show the rest of our community who actually is the best of the best!
We have made our XP rates high so you can train and PK in a short period of time.

If this is an economy server and people have to work for things, then why is spawn filled with NPCs lined up? Seems like they all sell necessary things. If this is the case then do not try to advertise as an eco server, cuz it’s not. Your economy will last about a week if that is the route you are taking.</p>
