    <title>Jar Help - Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jar-help-error/437926</link>
    <description>I have a 317 Client for a Project Insanity.

The Base Client with no changes, jars perfectly fine, and you can launch it up. But if I even comment out 1 useless line of text in say, the Gui and try jarring I will receive the same error every time when trying to run it.

I am not sure how to fix this or what is causing it.

My Manifest Looks like this

[code]
Main-Class: client


[/code]

What&#39;s more odd, is if I go back and uncomment the line and re-compile. I still get the same error, so problem in short - If I mess with anything in the files, I cannot jar. And If I fix my changes to original, it still will not allow me to jar.

Please help, thanks.</description>
