    <description>Ok well, for some reason, my one shop refuses to open up. I have an NPC set in my shop area in my autospawn.cfg file. I also went into the shops and made a shop for it. I also went into my client.java file, and made the wanneShop thing for it. The numbers next to the wanneShop match the shop ID, and the NPC ID matches the ID identified in the if statement for that particular shop. I only have this problem for this shop, and all of my other shops open perfectly. Does anyone know what is wrong with it?</description>

              <p>Well, I have it as the second slot in my shops, and I have a shop at the top that is not connected to any NPC on my server. =/ I changed the numbers on the code for the sandwich lady (NPCID = 3117). Maybe it is something to do with it being her?</p>

              <p>I’ll tell you one problem I had and you might not believe me… Try moving your npc in autospawn.cfg toward the very top of your autospawn.cfg. DO NOT ask me why this would work. I had the exact same problem, everything compiled fine, I did the wanneshop thing too. But for some reason when I did that it fixed it. Just try it.</p>
