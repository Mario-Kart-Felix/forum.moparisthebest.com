    <title>Does anyone remember GraveScape 508?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anyone-remember-gravescape-508/527596</link>
    <description>Ohhh man. I used to love this server. It was just perfect man. I want people to post about their favorite memory about it if you&#39;ve play. If you haven&#39;t played it, google it and look at some of the stuff it had. Otherwise, post what you loved or didn&#39;t like about the server, or spectate what others say.

Only reason I&#39;m posting about a server, is cause it was just amazing. Its worth talking about, and its my first topic in this board, so I want to make this something interesting.


I really loved the magic and summoning, how your pet gets raised as your summoning level increases when the pet is fighting.

I really HATED that the server went down.</description>
