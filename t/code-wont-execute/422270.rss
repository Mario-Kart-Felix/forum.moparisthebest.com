    <title>Code won&#39;t execute</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/code-wont-execute/422270</link>
    <description>Hey guys. I have a while loop within a while loop. And within the first while loop there is an if statement. In which I know should be executed. Here is the code:

[code]												
			while (index &lt; 100 &amp;&amp; index &lt; size) {
				String amount = xpList.get(index).toString();
				System.out.println(amount+&quot;a&quot;);
				System.out.println(XP+&quot;a&quot;);
				if (amount == XP) {
					System.out.println(&quot;Test&quot;);
					int rank = index+1;
				}
				System.out.println(&quot;Cheese&quot;);
				while (index2 &lt; 100 &amp;&amp; index2 &lt; size) {
					String matchName = List1.get(index2).toString();
					if (matchName.startsWith(amount)) {
						writeLog(matchName, &quot;Log&quot;);					}
					index2++;
				}
				index++;
			}[/code]

The output statements are there to see if the strings ever are identical. Which they are. Yet it doesn not execute the if statement, amount == xp. This is confusing because it does not execute the output statement of &quot;test&quot; even though the condition is true.

All help is appreciated.

Thanks.</description>

<p>== compares the objects in Memory. If you create two strings, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">String s = "test";
String t = "test";</code></pre>
<p>doing</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">s == t</code></pre>
<p>Will return false. While the data that they represent may be the same, they were allocated at different points in the memory. Now the reason you can use == for primitive data types (int, short, byte, etc) is because there’s no “extra data” associated with them. 1 is 1, 2 is 2, 1 is not 2.</p>
<p>As for an example, it’s just like any other conditional</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (s.equals(t)) {
    doSomething();
}</code></pre>

              <p>[quote=“razorback, post:3, topic:422270”]No. Because the outputs of amount+“a” and XP+“a” execute. It’s just that within the if statement.

<p>With Objects, == != .equals(); To compare Strings, you must use str.equals(). The reason for this is because == refers to the data in member (allocation in RAM), whereas .equals compares the actual data contained inside the string.</p>
