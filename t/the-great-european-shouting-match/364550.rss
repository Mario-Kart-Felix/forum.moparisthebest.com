Pretty good article, and some great &#39;Europe seen by the [i]insert country or group here[/i]&#39; examples. I&#39;ll put them here for you lot not interested in reading the article (Which I suggest you do, it isn&#39;t just about these pictures).

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Europe seen by the Germans:[/b]
[img]http://assets.bigthink.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/strangemaps/24357/%5Bmap1%5D.jpg[/img]
Quite insidiously, the colour toning of this map binds Germany to its linguistically related neighbours, i.e. Luxembourg, Switzerland and Austria. Since World War Two, any such hint at territorial ambitions beyond the borders of the Bundesrepublik is a definite nein-nein. The Swiss are labelled Schokolade (&#39;chocolate&#39;), the Austrians Schnitzelreich (&#39;escalope empire&#39;). Reducing other countries to their (perceived) national dish is a very ancient type of put-down (compare the age-old French moniker for the English: les rosbif). Another colour tone difference, this time in Germany itself, is between the former West and East Germanies, the former labelled Sparkasse (&#39;savings bank&#39;), the other called Proletariat. It reflects the fading, but still powerful division between the prosperous west and the poorer former German Democratic Republic in the east, which has been the beneficiary of billions of euros of government support after Unification in 1990.

Other examples of the culinary dismissive jibe include Belgium (&#39;waffles&#39;), Hungary (&#39;goulash&#39;), Poland (&#39;vegetables&#39;), Ireland (&#39;whiskey&#39;) and Bulgaria (&#39;schnapps&#39;). Russia is simply seen as a gas vault, the Ukraine and Belarus as &#39;gas transit land&#39;. A crude portrayal perhaps, but not far from the larger, geopolitical truth. Russia is the largest single supplier of natural gas to Europe. Former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder now sits on the board of Nord Stream, a company piping Russian gas into Europe.

Apart from eating and heating, Germans are also shown to be quite obsessed with Freizeit (&#39;holiday&#39; marked across Slovenia and Croatia, &#39;cheap hotels here&#39; in Greece and Spain, its islands transformed in &#39;Balearic Germany&#39;). Italy&#39;s label &#39;pizza and museums&#39; acknowledges that country&#39;s culinary and cultural attractions. The Czech republic and Slovakia are referred to merely by the names of their capital cities (Prague and Bratislava), perhaps to reflect their popularity as a citytrip destinations.

Most of former Yugoslavia is labelled &#39;uncharted&#39;, while Turkey is reduced to its role as &#39;workforce source&#39; (there are about 4 million Turkish Gastarbeiter and their descendants living in Germany). Of all the other labels, two stick out: &#39;Enigma code breakers&#39; (UK) and &#39;old neighbours&#39; (the Baltics) - two oblique references to the Second World War, the former suggesting some residual resentment, the latter a form of nostalgia. The rather neutral depicition of France as Eiffelreich (&#39;empire of [Gustave] Eiffel, he of the Eiffel Tower) on the other hand reflects the non-animosity between France and Germany that has become the cornerstone of European good neighbourliness and integration.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Europe seen by the Italians:[/b]
[img]http://assets.bigthink.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/strangemaps/24357/%5Bmap2%5D.jpg[/img]
The Italian view of the European continent is alternately ignorant and harsh, with Eastern Europe dismissed as dominated by &#39;porn stars&#39; (Hungary; no doubt a reference to La Cicciolina), &#39;thieves&#39; (Romania), &#39;babysitters&#39; (Bulgaria), &#39;women with braided hair&#39; (Ukraine) and &#39;Other Slavs&#39; (Slovakia). Other latin countries are merely seen as extensions of Italy (France is the &#39;Bruni Empire&#39;, Spain is full of &#39;Italian dialects&#39;) or of other countries (Portugal is &#39;Brazil&#39;). The British Islands are reduced to popular sports (&#39;Rugby&#39; for Ireland and &#39;Wembley Stadium&#39;, the home of soccer, for the UK). Switzerland is the land of &#39;(cuckoo) clocks&#39;, while the Germans pay for their reputation as hard workers with the put-down &#39;clock addicts&#39;. Poland still is the land of Karol Woytila, the previous Pope, while Russia, again, is nothing more but a source of natural gas. Turkey is the land not of guest workers but of belly dancers.

Just like Germany, Italy itself is also split in two, also reflecting a dichotomy between a richer half (in this case the north) and a poorer half (the south, labelled &#39;Ethiopia&#39; - Sicily is even called &#39;Somalia&#39;).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Europe seen by the Bulgarians:[/b]
[img]http://assets.bigthink.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/strangemaps/24357/%5Bmap3%5D.jpg[/img]
From a Bulgarian perspective, Russia is not the land of natural gas, but of natural alliances (i.e. &#39;Big Brother&#39;). Reflecting some theories on the origin and migrations of the Bulgarian people, Ukraine is named their &#39;Urheimat&#39;. The Serbs next door have earned a reputation as &#39;loose cannon&#39;, while Albania is (expressly?) mislabeled &#39;Kosovo&#39;, and Montenegro &#39;South Serbia&#39;. Macedonia is called &#39;Greek Slavs&#39;, while the Greeks are &#39;dish breakers&#39;. Germany and France are reduced to  some of their best-known export products (cars and cheese), while Belgium is seen as the home of the EU, a generous provider of subsidies (hence &#39;God&#39;). Poland, bizarrely, is the land of &#39;sexy fembots&#39;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Europe seen by the French:[/b]
[img]http://assets.bigthink.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/strangemaps/24357/%5Bmap4%5D.jpg[/img]
France is portrayed as still recovering from its early 19th-century ambitions of dominating the continent. Hence the labelling of both Belgium and Switzerland as &#39;semi-France&#39;, Russia as &#39;Napoleon&#39;s dream&#39;, Austria as &#39;old archenemy&#39; and Portugal als &#39;English allies&#39;. Other countries are labelled to reflect possible alliances, i.e. Ireland (&#39;catholics&#39;), Romania and Moldova (&#39;poor brothers&#39; and &#39;poor cousins&#39;). The faintest praise is reserved for the Germans (&#39;best friends&#39; - one can almost hear teeth gnash), while Algeria is still seen with nostalgia: &#39;France woz here&#39;. Reflecting a political attitude not shared by some other major European powers, France sees Turkey as &#39;definitely not Europeans&#39;. Hungary for once is not seen as a country of pornstars, but as &#39;Sarko&#39;s land&#39;, the ancestral country of  France&#39;s president Nicolas Sarkozy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Europe seen by the gays:[/b]
[img]http://assets.bigthink.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/strangemaps/24357/%5Bmap5%5D.jpg[/img]
A hilariously different perspective is offered by this map of Europe as seen by the gay community. Sweden for once isn&#39;t the land of Volvo, but of trashy dance music (does that include Abba, though?) Catholic Ireland is &#39;in denial&#39;, while Catholic Poland is the &#39;Bible Belt&#39;. Slovakia and Hungary respectively are the source of &#39;military porn&#39; and &#39;non-military porn&#39; (what is it with those Hungarians? Or those Slovakians, for that matter). Not all is well in the &#39;Federated Holiday States of the Mediterranean&#39;, as they are adjacent to the lands of &#39;straight homos&#39; (Italy), homophobic tribes (most of the Balkan) and &#39;sexy homophobic men&#39; (Turkey). Even on a gay map, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland are still the countries of waffles, hash and snow, respectively.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Europe seen by the British:[/b]
[img]http://assets.bigthink.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/strangemaps/24357/%5Bmap6%5D.jpg[/img]
its membership of the European Union. Three elements combine to reinforce Britain&#39;s euroskepticism: its geography as an island nation, the legacy of its overseas Empire and its heroic role as the sole holdout against a continent dominated by the Nazis. Margaret Thatcher tried to steer the European Community in the direction of a purely economic alliance of sovereign nations, but the drive towards &#39;ever closer union&#39; (as mandated by the EU&#39;s own founding texts) has proved inexorable - and very ominous, from a British perspective.

Europe is therefore not seen as a collection of states, but as an &#39;Evil Federated Empire of Europe&#39;, producing all kinds of goods that may or may not be good to get into the UK (statues, cake, beer and soup, but also drugs, pest, dirty porn and immigrants). The Russian exiles, outrageously wealthy even for London standards, have given Russia the reputation of &#39;big spenders&#39;. Iceland, reflecting its dubious role in the recent financial meltdown, is labelled &#39;Las Vegas&#39;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Europe seen by the Americans:[/b]
[img]http://assets.bigthink.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/strangemaps/24357/%5Bmap7%5D.jpg[/img]
This map offers an external, and even more unidimensional perspective on European diversity. Americans apparently still see Russia (and Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova) as thinly veiled communists, and the Scandinavian countries as one big &#39;socialist union&#39; (it must be a relief for the Danes to be called something other than Vikings, for the Finns not to be reduced to their mobile phone industry and for the Swedes to be linked to something else than Volvo, Ikea or Abba). The Netherlands, soft on drugs, are &#39;Sodom&#39;, the Iberian peninsula is dominated by Brazil and Mexico, Italy is simply &#39;godfathers&#39; country, France is full of &#39;smelly people&#39; and the UK is affectionately called &#39;mummy&#39;. Ex-Yugoslavia is &#39;resident evil&#39;, while Turkey is &#39;thanksgiving dinner&#39;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

British lost their status as the WORLD superpower after the war of 1812 when we beat you for a second time and when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Monroe Doctrine</a> was put in place.

<p>Strong Navy &lt; Strong Military</p>
<p>Im not pulling the MITB “oh we kicked your ass” argument, just that we did win but after WW2 it matters so little.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, no. Loosing one battle doesn’t change the world status they had. Britain still was one of the largest economies in the world, larger than the US approaching the 19th century, it had much stronger military power, not just as a maritime nation. The battle of 1812 was MINUSCULE in comparison to those being fought in Europe against the french, spanish and everyone else who were continually challenging the empire.</p>
<p>Britain’s empire actually went through its fastest expansion well after that battle. It changed very little at all. Britain had lost individual battles to France before, France had lost Individual battles to Britain. It is remembered as such a large battle in American history because yes, it was big for them - but was tiny in comparison.</p>
<p>I don’t want to sound like I’m playing down an American win and a British loss, because I’m not. There is a reason why it is remembered, because the US was still a developing country and managed to “win” against massive British empire, twice. But just look at all the other wars going on in Europe at that time, and you’ll see the significance of it outside of the US isn’t as big.</p>

<p>Obviously every nation has it’s own history told in its own way.

I really need to road-trip across America sometime and Australia too just to get a feel for their enormous size, it’s difficult to comprehend how many times bigger other countries really are.

<p>The term superpower wasn’t even recognised until post WWII, before then it was just “Britain”. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> OK so the last part’s a joke, but seriously, America was no world power in 1812 and Britain’s empire was still HUGE in 1812, so we certainly weren’t knocked off the top spot. Plus we were fighting the French in 1812 and that’s where the real war was at, or so history dictates. The war was never really won, it just kind of ended with all sides at peace.</p>
<p>An extract from wikipedia, coz we know that’s what yakman would do:</p>
<blockquote>During the 19th century the popular image of the war in the United States was of an American victory, and in Canada, of a Canadian victory. Each young country saw her self-perceived victory as an important foundation of her growing nationhood. The British, on the other hand, who had been preoccupied by Napoleon's challenge in Europe, paid little attention to what was to them a peripheral and secondary dispute.</blockquote>
The whole thing is generally quite interesting;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812

Britain was still <span class="bbcode-b">a</span> world superpower just not <span class="bbcode-b">the</span> world superpower.</p>
<p>Doesnt really matter, after we <span class="bbcode-s">all helped each other</span> helped Britain in ww2 we all became the ever so kickass free world.</p>
<p>Strong Navy &lt; Strong Military</p>
<p>Im not pulling the MITB “oh we kicked your ass” argument, just that we did win but after WW2 it matters so little.</p>

<p>The British only lost their status as the world super power (or HyperPower as it was sometimes referred to) when they couldn’t maintain the largest navy in the world (right up to and shortly after World War 2), and all the other costs in governing other countries, meaning loosing exclusive trade routes and resulting in a loss in economic competitiveness, leaving countries like the US to take over.</p>

              <p>Anyone who’s confused by the reference of Britain as America’s mummy, it’s actually a historical thing, funnily enough Moparisthebest nearly hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>The British empire was the largest ever in human history, mainly due to it’s complete domination of the seas of the world. It remained this way for a long portion of time, Britain was the worlds superpower for well over a century but by 1942 the second world war had it’s toll on the UK and our empire was left broken and abandoned after that.</p>
<p>This would be the turning point of world supremacy, with Germany in tatters and America being the “one” to help finish the job. It landed itself in riches and power, America was considered a daughter of the empire. Many regard present American world power as the British Empire II. New York and Washington have simply taken the place of London.</p>
<p>The success story was our worldwide sea ports and naval dominance, all controlled from London, and the pioneering of the industrial revolution, with Germany’s Hitler and India’s Gandhi being the Empire’s demise. America’s rise to power comes from it’s rapid industry and business growth. The world wars left Britain penniless and weak (although we were defending europe) and Corporatocracy led to the rise of America.</p>
<p>EDIT: I know some of you, namely Moparisthebest would like to disagree because you affectionately “kicked our asses out”* but I can offer you some reassurance in that America is not the only child of Britain. We gave birth to Australia (Hi Lothy), Canada (hi Tico), NZ (sup Cain), India, South Africa, Ireland, Jamaica etc.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:6, topic:364550”]All I can really comment on is the map of Europe from an American perspective.
