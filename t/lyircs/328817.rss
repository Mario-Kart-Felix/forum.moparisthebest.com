    <description>For when I die, I shall be awakened.
Not into a nightmare, but into a spiritual state
Be it heaven, be it hell. I&#39;ll be one with myself
Without materialism or pre-concived ideas
I&#39;ll sigh and strech and proclaim
&quot;I&#39;m finally home, in my place of rest&quot;
&lt;Chorus&gt;
For there will be no heaven, nor will their be hell
There will be your place, devoid of all hate
*There will be you time, without expectation
*You&#39;ll be able to become, who you truely are.
*&lt;End chorus&gt;
*We live this life, constant fear of rejection
We live this life, with a certain expectation
We fear the invevitable, where we should embrace.
For we make this life, disregarding ourselves
Is it to much to ask, to be happy?
Is it to much to ask, to be yourself?</description>

Smell -In my breathe reminding smell of death<br>
Dreams -In my head slowly fade away<br>
The end -Is nearby me and I want it to be</p>
<p>The king - Inside my head seducing me to betray<br>
You -The only one making myself me<br>
The loss -In my life great it will be<br>
The game -Is taking me and the prize is defeat</p>

Inevitable, my destiny</p>

Grobing for a lifehold a place to stay<br>
Fingers are slipping and I´m falling down<br>
Into the world I know the world of sadness</p>
<p>Room -In my heart empty as a well<br>
Still -Waiting for the victory to take<br>
In vain -I´ve lost this game before I´ve even born<br>
Defeat -My destiny all I ever get</p>

Stretching up and over me.<br>
Soften this old armor.<br>
Hoping I can clear the way<br>
By stepping through my shadow,<br>
Coming out the other side.<br>
Step into the shadow.<br>
Forty six and two are just ahead of me.</p>

Which gives a response, for the automatic *bang*
Clip to release projectiles in single
File forcing me to ignite then travel
Through the barrel, headed for the light
At the end of a tunnel, with no specific target in sight
Slow the flow like h2o water
Visualize, the scene of a homicide, a slaughter
No remorse for the course I take when you pull it
The result's a stray bullet
Niggaz who knew hit the ground runnin and stay down
Except for the kids who played on the playground
Cause for some little girl she'll never see
More than six years of life, trif-le-ing
When she fell from the seesaw
But umm wait, my course isn't over
Fled out of the other side of her head towards
A red, range, rover, then I ricochet
Fast past a brother's ass, oh damn, what that nigga say
Aww fuck it, next target's margaret's face *bang*
And I struck it
Now it's a flood of blood in circumfrence to her face
And an abundance of brains all over the street
Shame how we had to meet *bang*
Dashin, buckin, greet by fuckin family
They follow behind me in a orderly fashion
Bashin through flesh I'm wild
Crashin through the doors of projects hallways
To deflect off of the tile
I'm coming for you little girl
Once inside I shatter your world
Swirl, no more dreams no hopes when I spray
You better pray, to the pope or the vatican
Before I go rat-tat-a-tat again
I'm mad again brother somebody's mother will be sad again
But, whose blue skies will turn grey
From the attack, of the mac-11, I'm a stray, bullet

He's fed up with fast food,
Out of his mind, one mad dude.
Grabbed his guns, went downtown.
Mr. McDeath is coming to track Ronald down.

Now the golden arches are bloodstained red.
Ronald is dead... took a bullet in the head.

May I take your order please?
NOOOO!!!!!
Can I help you sir?
NOOOO!!!!!

He came inside, took a seat<br>
They didn’t know he didn’t come to eat<br>
Asked for his order, got a bullet instead.<br>
Ronald can’t help… Ronald is dead.<br>

May I take your order please?<br>
NOOOO!!!<br>
Oh my god he’s got a gun!<br>
McDonaldland Massacre<br>
(Assorted Mayhem, gunshots (semi-automatic), screams)<br>
Ronald is lying on the floor,<br>
The Grimace took a bullet trying to run out the door.<br>
