    <description>Hey guys I added Hati to my server earlier today with the npc id: 13460 I added it by using the NPCSpawning.java. 

When Hati is spawned manually through the developer console it attacks players but for some reason it doesn&#39;t when I added it to the NPCSpawning.java

I think it is also important that you know I am using Rune-Evo 718 source

This is the code I added to my NPCSpawning.java
[code]
HAITI(13460, 2702, 3626, 0, true);
[/code]

Additionally, I added the following to NPC.java
[code]
if (id == 13460)
{
setRandomWalk(true);
}
[/code]

Any help would be greatly appreciated!</description>
