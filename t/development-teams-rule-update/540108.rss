    <description>[quote=&quot;Taharok, post:1, topic:297296&quot;]This new section is [b]just[/b] for development teams. The other section is for everything else development-related.

Like the Tutorials section, every post in this section must first be approved before appearing. Staff members will notify you if your team was denied for whatever reason.

In order to be approved, your team must meet the following requirements:


[ul][li]You need to provide some sort of evidence that your development team will be successful (ie, pictures).[/li]
[li]Your work must be your own. Stealing other people&#39;s work is unacceptable and isn&#39;t tolerated here.[/li]
[li]Absolutely no advertising is allowed in this section. It is simply for recruiting people for your development team. You may discuss development here with your team, as well as discuss other features you plan on developing.[/li]
[li]If you are going to post a website, you [b]must[/b] first get it approved with an Administrator or a Global Moderator. Failure to do this will result in an infraction for advertising.[/li][/ul]


[b]Note: [/b]This board is unique to other boards on MoparScape. Here, you have privileges to moderate your own topic. Do [b]not[/b] abuse this ability, otherwise your topic will be locked. Keep this section for your teams. If you wish to post other related development progress, post it [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,125.0.html]here[/url].

If you have any questions, post them in this topic.

Edit: This section still needs some tweaking. Please give us a little while to perfect it. Thanks. :D[/quote]
Let me start by saying that these rules are outdated. These rules were meant to be for both the Development Team board and Server Development boards, and then the two split. To start, posts no longer require approval to appear in the board. Below I&#39;ve made some rules that I think would be fitting for the section, as well as a few suggestions.

[ul][li]&lt;blockquote&gt;You need to provide some sort of evidence that your development team will be successful (ie, pictures).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It seems to me that one thread will meet this requirement, while another thread that appears to be exactly the same won&#39;t. Perhaps instead of this vague requirement, set some actual guidelines that threads are expected to have. Examples could be an application template, a brief description of your development&#39;s goals, and a way to contact the thread poster outside and within the forums.[/li]
[li]&lt;blockquote&gt;Your work must be your own. Stealing other people&#39;s work is unacceptable and isn&#39;t tolerated here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This doesn&#39;t have a place in the development teams board. That said, it doesn&#39;t have too much relevancy to recruiting developers.[/li]
[li]Clarify whether or not there is a minimal limit to how many developers a person must be looking to recruit before posting a thread, and make a point to outline that in the section rules.[/li]
[li]Allow thread owners to moderate their own threads.[/li][/ul]


That&#39;s all for now. :)</description>

As for the matter of link approval, we could just have moderators comment on the topics and then after your link put a link to the approval message, ie [iurl=#my_site]My Site[/iurl][sup][iurl=#approval_msg][1][/iurl][/sup].</p>

              <p>I don’t think that’s going to happen, considering the nature of how topics are bumped the bad apples would die and there isn’t enough influx to clog up the pipes. Besides, that’s not what the rule changes would allow. Those sort of topics would still be disallowed. My point was we should have rules that cover the minimum amount of information for a topic to function (contact info, what they’re looking for, some technical information etc) and then anything beyond that should be considered guidelines to improve the chances of acquiring applicants.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t be using the rules to enforce a standard upon topics within the section, it’s not our responsibility to force people to post high quality development advertisements with lots of shiny things if they don’t want to. We enforce what people need to know, and then anything beyond that is at the judgment of the poster. All we need to ensure is that what is posted can be read and acted upon in the way we intended with topics in that section.</p>

<p>I agree with this as well, the staff team is capable of managing the board, especially now we have a more sectional oriented system. We can be quite modular with it so it won’t be an issue.</p>

              <p>The problem is with threads that don’t have enough information in them tend to clutter the sections pages leaving the real, hard working groups ignored. You say people who put more effort in see more results but it is hard when nobody can see your post because every other post with “looking for good coder to help with my project - must know what you’re doing” ruins your chances.</p>
<p>If we had a sectional understanding of what needs to be posted in order to respond it might pick up the sections standards rather then what it is now. It is hard enough to find a group without people knocking you out of the way when they only spend 2 minutes on a project.</p>
<p>Not to mention, having a nicely presented and fully informing thread helps those looking for groups. They get the full information they need, and then they can decide on if they want to apply or not. It makes it so much easier then going out on a limb to see if the project is what you want.</p>
<p>If you don’t want the section to turn into an advertisement section then don’t let it, don’t allow them to show off the server for the servers sake. If the thread doesn’t reflect on what the owner wants to do with it then have the pictures removed until it is changed. It says “this is awesome home, got tones of shops and great features” then take it away, make people say “this is the current home but still undecided, i want to find a place suitable for the layout of the server and hopefully it will be decided within the team”. It shows direction of the team rather then a show off of it, and if it doesn’t then you should be strict.</p>
<p>This being said, i believe all threads should be approved before they’re posted so that they’re moderated effectively, that way you don’t get a thread slipping up and advertising.</p>
<p>I agree that rules need to be changed, however they need to be thoroughly thought out before hand.</p>

<p>Secondly, what are pictures evidence of? Topics with large numbers of images are a pain in the arse (I say this as someone who has to tether off his phone at the moment for internet, and as such only has a 3GB quota per month).</p>
<p>Finally, I don’t see why there should be a minimum threshold as far as team size goes. If I decide tomorrow that I want to start a project then I should be able to post there, even if I only want one person to work with.</p>

              <p>I agree with most of these proposals. I think the requirement to include ‘pictures’ and ‘evidence’ is absurd; a screenshot of an Eclipse project means nothing, and the same goes for a screenshot of any in-game activity. We should have basic guidelines that can be followed when making a topic, such as including all relevant information to anyone who wants to make an informed application. The implication that staff should be deciding whether or not a development team will be successful is ludicrous. Lots of projects fail and a few succeed, but it’s not up to the staff to decide on this unless the original topic is severely lacking in information.</p>

              <p>They shouldn’t need to constitute anything as evidence, there should be guidelines on what goes into the section (such as have media, change log etc) but we shouldn’t actively pursue a standard for what a topic must contain for it to be considered a plausible development in the rules. If somebody posts a bad topic then they won’t get any applicants, likewise with server advertisements if they post a bad advertisement they won’t get any players. They’re both advertisements just for different roles. The only exception is if the topic doesn’t contain a link to the server for example with advertisements then it would be considered dysfunctional.</p>
<p>Honestly if the server contains all the core information, where it’s at, and what they need doing then it’s fine. For example (sorry to pick at amy on this one):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,658928.msg4407445.html" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,658928.msg4407445.html</a></p>
<p>I don’t see the issue with just letting this one slide, it’s functional and people can apply. Basically, the rules should account for the bare minimum and guidelines can account for the rest. Also I think allowing people to look for partners and not just groups of people is fine. What’s the problem with that?</p>

I’m against links within either board to be honest. The development showoff board is meant to be just that (as I see it) - a showoff board.</p>

Keep in mind I feel like this should include people who plan on starting from nothing or close to it. The current rules also state you are not allowed to share your website/forums etc. However I feel these could be used to   show evidence of that fact that they will be successful.</p>

              <p>I agree with this, I also feel there should be a distinct separation between people looking for 1 person to help them with their server &amp; someone who is actually looking for a team. A lot of people are told to make a development team when in reality they are only looking for one person to partner with and currently we have no place to send them. They are stuck between the two.</p>
<p>Secondly what exactly constitutes as “evidence” a picture of the the client? A picture of an IDE project? I wouldn’t really call that evidence. It seems like it should just be made so all topics &amp; moderated and have to be approved &amp; only topics that have a well thought-out and concise objective should be approved (wasn’t it like this before?) e.g post with effort put into them.</p>
<blockquote>Your work must be your own. Stealing other people's work is unacceptable and isn't tolerated here.</blockquote>
I'm pretty sure nearly everyone in that section is using some sort of server base which I am fine with. I think this is just an warning about claiming others work as your own.

<p>Like the Tutorials section, every post in this section must first be approved before appearing. Staff members will notify you if your team was denied for whatever reason.</p>
<p>In order to be approved, your team must meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>[ul][li]You need to provide some sort of evidence that your development team will be successful (ie, pictures).[/li]<br>
[li]Your work must be your own. Stealing other people’s work is unacceptable and isn’t tolerated here.[/li]<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note: </span>This board is unique to other boards on MoparScape. Here, you have privileges to moderate your own topic.

<p>If you have any questions, post them in this topic.</p>
<p>Edit: This section still needs some tweaking. Please give us a little while to perfect it. Thanks. :D[/quote]<br>
Let me start by saying that these rules are outdated. These rules were meant to be for both the Development Team board and Server Development boards, and then the two split. To start, posts no longer require approval to appear in the board. Below I’ve made some rules that I think would be fitting for the section, as well as a few suggestions.</p>
<p>[ul][li]</p><blockquote>You need to provide some sort of evidence that your development team will be successful (ie, pictures).</blockquote><br>
It seems to me that one thread will meet this requirement, while another thread that appears to be exactly the same won’t. Perhaps instead of this vague requirement, set some actual guidelines that threads are expected to have. Examples could be an application template, a brief description of your development’s goals, and a way to contact the thread poster outside and within the forums.[/li]<br>
[li]<blockquote>Your work must be your own. Stealing other people’s work is unacceptable and isn’t tolerated here.</blockquote><br>
This doesn’t have a place in the development teams board. That said, it doesn’t have too much relevancy to recruiting developers.[/li]<br>
[li]Clarify whether or not there is a minimal limit to how many developers a person must be looking to recruit before posting a thread, and make a point to outline that in the section rules.[/li]<br>
[li]Allow thread owners to moderate their own threads.[/li][/ul]
<p>That’s all for now. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
