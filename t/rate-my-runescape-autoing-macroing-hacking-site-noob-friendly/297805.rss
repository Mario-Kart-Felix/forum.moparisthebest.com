    <description>Hey guys,

After years of getting help from the cheating community I have decided to make my own runescape autoing/macroing/cheating site. I would like you all to rate it, it has downloads to popular programs such as SCAR and scripts to help you auto. I have made it as noob-friendly as possible, and I hope it helps you all just like I have been helped in the past!

Without further ado, here is my site:

<p>First of all, both links down, disregarding what you said<br>
Second, Freewebtown and TK both sucks. If you wish to at least be more successful, at least get a .co.cc or a <a href="http://co.uk" rel="nofollow noopener">co.uk</a>, or even pay cheaply for a .info or a .com/net/org<br>
Third, Advertising.<br>
Fourth, Advertising<br>
5. I don’t think MITB cares about autoing/macroing/cheating as much as MSCP. You’d have better “success” there.</p>
