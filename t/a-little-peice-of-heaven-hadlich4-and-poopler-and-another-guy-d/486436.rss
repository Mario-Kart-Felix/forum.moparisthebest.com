    <description>[center]A Little Peice Of Heaven[/center]
[center]&quot;Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold that&#39;s why I got a heater for your thighs&quot;[/center]


We definitely need a coder, im decent but not the best by far, if you wanna help please pm me with your recent work or any experience you have.

Me - Lead designer, Weapons and Amour Modeler, basic coder for now until we find a head coder.

Poopler - Npc Modeler and designer.


Me and poopler are starting a new project, not named yet :p. Any how we are going to take all jagex armour/weapon out, rune armour, god armours, all sets EVERYTHING! we wanna be ORIGINAL tired of all the rsps&#39;s that are the same thing, just remakes of rs, when i think of rsps i think unique, new, different, so ima make that happen. 

Here are some of our goals:


[ul][li]Slave system - the slave system involves buying goblins and cottin gins or land and such from Eli Whitney. It may be something were you get a daily reward for the more land, slaves, and cottin gins you own not sure yet.[/li]

[li]Get rid of Jagex Amour and Weapons! - we wanna be unique and original so why not make our own stuff![/li][/ul]

[ul][li]Ship fighting Minigame? - ive had this minigame on my mind a lot, not sure exactly how its gunna work, and it may not, but with what i got in my mind if i can make it happen it would be an interesting addition to the game.[/li][/ul]


[ul][li]Classes - instead of making a person character like just humans maybe have classes or races like in skyrim its just a thought i had i know its possible.[/li][/ul]


what we need is designs, we already got some of course but any art from ya&#39;ll would help and it would give you a chance to see some of your stuff in the game. so go ahead design weapons and armour and npcs anything you would want to see in the game :D and if you dont wanna design let us know what you think of the project.

if you have a design you want me to look at pm me a picture, thanks.

March 17th 2013 EDIT:

ok so its been a while and many ideas have aroused and many things have been planned and done. heres a few more additions we are gunna make as well


[ul][li]City clans in a way - each city will have a npc who the character talks to and can get armour to signify that he is part of that cities clan. All cities will have a pay toll. if you want to enter that city u gotta pay a toll, the more important the city the more money. there will be level requirments to be part of each city. this will also give players a chance to have city wars if they feel the need.[/li]
[li] Labor Unions - you will go to an npc (Mr.Pullman) and apply to work for him, you will be sent to an island to work and mine ores and other things and sell the ores to him for a certain amount of money and once you earn a certain amount of money you can teleport out, not gunna spoil the fun but from this feature there will be a way to get a new item called shout gauntlets, gauntlets that allow you to use a cool ass special :p[/li][/ul]


[ul][li]So me and another designer decided to make a change, we are keeping the basic sets, bronze-rune, range hides/bows, basic mage robes and just gunna take out the bosses and armour from bosses outa god war dungeon and other stuff and make our own, there will be our own dragon armour and weapons, and a new way to acquire them, now you will make it from dragon scales and horns. we are also gunna keep barrows armour and barrows minigame. but basically besides those things, all other armour/ weapons are gunna be gone. [/li][/ul]

please tell me what you think of the ideas, thanks!</description>

The time that coders actually made some unique things seems to be passed.<br>
So i am asking you to show me they have not.<br>
IF you indeed posses the skills to show me they have not.<br>
I shall contact you once more in a more private manner.<br>

<p>[ul][li]So me and another designer decided to make a change, we are keeping the basic sets, bronze-rune, range hides/bows, basic mage robes and just gunna take out the bosses and armour from bosses outa god war dungeon and other stuff and make our own, there will be our own dragon armour and weapons, and a new way to acquire them, now you will make it from dragon scales and horns. we are also gunna keep barrows armour and barrows minigame. but basically besides those things, all other armour/ weapons are gunna be gone.
