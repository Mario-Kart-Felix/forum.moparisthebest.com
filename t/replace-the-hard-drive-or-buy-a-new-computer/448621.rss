    <title>Replace the hard drive, or buy a new computer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/replace-the-hard-drive-or-buy-a-new-computer/448621</link>
    <description>I bought a Compaq SR2020Nx (it&#39;s a few years old) decked it up with 4gb of ram (came with 512mb LMAO) it&#39;s worked for years, but now it&#39;s not booting, I&#39;ve re installed windows and used rescue discs and tryed installing Linux, EVERYTHING. Turns out the hard drive died. I found a cheap 300GB internal SATA, at best buy. Should I replace the hard drive, or buy a new computer?</description>

              <p>well HDDs will run 60-120 for standard sized SATA… and a new decent computer will run 300-400. your computer has pretty crap hardware and one component has already failed in the OEM build. for a long-term investment, i’d consider shelling out 180 more for a new computer that has everything you need. you can also get some money back by selling components from your old pc such as memory and cpu on ebay.</p>

              <p>I had a situation like this, only it was just dying in general, not any specific part, but almost every part was just running down, so I got the one I have now.  I’d recommend buying a new computer from my own experience.  Then again, you only need a hard drive, I would have pretty much needed everything but the computer ‘case’.</p>
