<p>I’m with you on that one! They indeed hardly produce any true power per liter.<br>
Thats what I was trying to prove too.</p>
<p>Displacement is not everything, good engineering and research&gt;displacement.<br>
It amazed me that they finnaly started using Mc Pherson struts instead of leave springs, or just a rack as suspension wich give the poor handeling.</p>

<p>Show me a engine WITHOUT forced induction. That engine naturally aspirated doesn’t produce more power per cylinder than the vette. Slap forced induction on the vette then, then it’ll be fair to compare right? Oh wait, you don’t need to because the chevy engine will produce more for less.[/quote]</p>
<p>Do I need to pull out the list with Honda engines again?</p>
<p>Let’s take examples:</p>
<p>B16A: 4 inline 1.6 liter 170HP &lt; Civic VTI (FWD)<br>
B16B: 4 inline 1.6 liter 185HP &lt; Civic Type-R (FWD)<br>
B18C '98 Spec (Type-R): 4 inline 1.8 liter 220HP &lt; Integra Type-R (FWD)<br>
H22A: 4 inline 2.2 liter 220HP &lt; Prelude VTI (FWD)<br>
K20A: 4 inline 2.0 liter 240HP &lt; Civic Type-R/Integra RSX (FWD)<br>
F20C: 4 inline 2.0 liter 250HP &lt; S2000 (RWD)<br>
C32B: V6 3.2 liter 300HP &lt; NSX (RWD)<br>
C35B: V6 3.5 liter 500HP &lt; NSX GT-R (RWD)</p>
<p>I think I see one engine that comes close to the C5 Z06 engine, no forced injection ‘just’ a V6 3.2 liter engine and produces 300HP.<br>
And the C35B V6 3.5 liter has no forced injection either, and it produces 500 HP, thats way more than the C5 Z06 engine has (385HP).<br>
It handles way better than the Corvette, it has a way better MPG ratio and it weights less.</p>
<p>Lets compare the engines:<br>
Z06: 5.7 V8 3,115 lb (1,413 kg)<br>
NSX GT-R: 3.5 V6  2,513 lb (1,140 kg)</p>
<p>Displacement difference:<br>
5700cc vs 3500cc</p>
<p>Engine difference:<br>
V8 vs V6</p>
<p>Weight difference:<br>
3,115 lb (1,413 kg) vs 2,513 lb (1,140 kg)</p>
<p>Power output:<br>
385HP vs 500HP</p>
<p>Now I don’t know much about the suspension of the Z06, but the NSX uses a Showa double wishbone suspension.<br>
the NSX has a Hewland 6 speed sequential gearbox. the Z06 has a ?</p>
<p>The only problem is, this is a European cars thread. So I don’t know why the Japanese stable has been released, but they don’t have anything to do with Europa :D.</p>

you’re calling me an idiot when you just thouht an evo X was an evo VIII? good job on that one[/quote]</p>
<p>When did I ever say that? I used a fair comparison between the two. Which you didn’t, you used some old ass evo which looked like it was in bad shape. Then you compared it to a fairly new c6 vette. I’ve been talking about the C5 model, not the C6… so who’s the idiot…?</p>

<p>You’re a fucking idiot comparing those cars. For that price you could get a c5 z06 on sterioids and handles and performs way better. It’s naturally aspirated and makes more horsepower. No replacement for displacement. Mitsubishi’s are notorious for breaking down and slapping a turbo on it and all of those electronics. You’re doomed for failure.</p>

<p>Let’s pull out the Honda squad with their naturally apsirated engines.</p>

<p>You showed me an engine with forced induction, what does that engine produce without it? That’s not showing the engines full potential. It’s a four cylinder, without the forced induction, you just can’t produce that power.</p>
<p>The mustang you tried to compare is a everyday car, and it’s way less. So it’s not going to be producing sport car numbers.</p>

<p>Let’s take examples:</p>
<p>B16A: 4 inline 1.6 liter 170HP &lt; Civic VTI (FWD)<br>
B16B: 4 inline 1.6 liter 185HP &lt; Civic Type-R (FWD)<br>
B18C '98 Spec (Type-R): 4 inline 1.8 liter 220HP &lt; Integra Type-R (FWD)<br>
H22A: 4 inline 2.2 liter 220HP &lt; Prelude VTI (FWD)<br>
K20A: 4 inline 2.0 liter 240HP &lt; Civic Type-R/Integra RSX (FWD)<br>
F20C: 4 inline 2.0 liter 250HP &lt; S2000 (RWD)<br>
C32B: V6 3.2 liter 300HP &lt; NSX (RWD)<br>
C35B: V6 3.5 liter 500HP &lt; NSX GT-R (RWD)</p>
<p>All of those engines are N/A, no turbo involved.</p>

<p>Ok, lets use a car that was never meant to be a performance car to compare to a Mitsubishi Evo.</p>
<ol>
<li>The evo uses forced induction, which you need on a four banger.</li>
<li>The mustang costs half the price, so what do you expect?</li>
</ol>
<p>You’re a fucking idiot comparing those cars. For that price you could get a c5 z06 on sterioids and handles and performs way better. It’s naturally aspirated and makes more horsepower. No replacement for displacement. Mitsubishi’s are notorious for breaking down and slapping a turbo on it and all of those electronics. You’re doomed for failure.</p>
<p>Now find a car that’s naturally aspirated. Then come back and talk bud.</p>
<p>Just keep it coming sanga, and I’ll keep proving you wrong.</p>

<p>What the fuck? Are you stuck in the 1950’s? The muscle car era is way gone.</p>
<p>POOR TURNING - Cobalt SS, import and excellent turning.</p>
<p>FUCKING UGLY - That’s an opinion.</p>
<p>TERRIBLE MPG - Haha, so terrible mpg is 30 on the highway with a car that is making over 400hp to the crank? Yeah right.</p>
<p>STUPID INTERIORS - I’ll agree with you on that one, but you can get nice interior as options on most cars.</p>
<p>POWER IS NOT EVERYTHING - Like I said, you’re stuck in the 1950s with that statement. New camaro’s and challengers are MADE that way. They’re made to bring back the muscle car and sell to people who love those kind of cars.</p>
<p>HEY LOOK AT THIS CAR IT’S HUGE, IT MUST B GR8. - Dodge neon srt4, cobalt ss, pontiac g6 gxp…just to name a few compact cars.</p>
<p>At least prove it, or I’ll keep doggin you and let your e-friends come to the rescue to make fun of me.</p>
