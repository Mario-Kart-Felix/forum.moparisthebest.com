    <title>New laptop maybe</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-laptop-maybe/442531</link>
    <description>so tomorrow i maybe getting a new laptop (http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Asus+-+15.6%26%2334%3B+Laptop+-+4GB+Memory+-+500GB+Hard+Drive+-+Matte+Dark+Brown+Suit/5036973.p?id=1218608970710&amp;skuId=5036973) i was going to get it b/c my current one was broke i was pretty sure it was a hardware problem and it was one of the ram sticks went bad. so i just upgraded to 8 gb and it is working even better now(I can play rs with all the setting on max and get 30 fps in the ge it used to be &lt;20, also skyrim isnt really laggy anymore idk the fps but i dont notice any visual lag). im upgrading from http://us.toshiba.com/computers/laptops/satellite/L500/L505-ES5036 i dont expect a lot of performance but for it being a 2nd gen i5 i feel like it will be a pretty nice performance boost form what i have atm.

I am going to swap the ram an install the 8gb in the new pc and put the 4 gb in this one. I am trying to decide if i should give my old laptop to my cousin or my brother. :/ i got this one for my hs graduation on my cousins bday which he was upset about but i understand. my cousin wanted me to help his mom pick out a computer for like $300 that has spec like my current laptop b/c he doesnt need that powerful of a laptop as long as he doesnt lag on this fps game &quot;Crossfire&quot;(i get 40-100 fps usually it fluctuates a lot) he will be ok until he gets money from his job he hasn&#39;t acquired yet to buy a gaming one. my computer would be an upgrade for him and his mother needs the money anyway to help afford a divorce lawyer[thats another story... :( my uncle is using the wrong head...(even though what i understand the women he i left for is more than twice the weight of my aunt and the meanest lady you could meet. smfh) im pretty saddened by this but i try not to think about it b/c i feel like i cant do anything about it since my aunt his wife for 17 years can get him to see and he children cant help him see either.]

my brother doesnt really play games. he plays crossfire and minecraft but thats about it. he is making light dubstep as like a hobby or whatever so he doesnt need too much power. my gma is wanting to give my brother one of her laptops for his graduation. I dont remember what processor it has but it runs crossfire and minecraft ok i think. i think the processor is a pentium but if its a T, P , or B series. I think he is fine with using this laptop i speak of b/c he used to it b4, for a while.

well comment on what you think. I looked online and i cant really find a better laptop for that price. its going to be like $29/month interest free for 18 months.</description>

              <p>The Asus model you posted is what I have for a laptop. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>It’s great, but try to watch out if you’re installing another os on it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> On the second day i have it, I picked the wrong partition and deleted Windows, plus they don’t include a recovery disc or partition like HP has so you’re kind of fucked on that, unless you have a cracked windows ofc. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>when i get some income ill look into it. I just got the laptop and swapped the ram. it had one 4gb stick in it. I put the 4 gb stick in my old laptop plus the older 2gb stick that wasnt bad. I think i should take the 2 gb back out b/c if the ram sticks arent the same speeds then the slower one is the speed they work at, correct? the 4gb is pc3-10600 while the other is 8500. so im just going to take the other stick out b/c it’s slowing down the system.</p>

              <p>I know asus is pretty good. I thought it was pretty decent. atm the moment i dont need a powerful laptop. after i get a job i plan on building myself a desktop. I should be going to get the laptop in 30 minutes or an hour. the display model at best buy had a broken display so i couldnt play around with it. the 500gb hdd is going to help b/c i run out of space on a 320gb hdd. my goal is to get better organization on my computer so hopefully i succeed.</p>
