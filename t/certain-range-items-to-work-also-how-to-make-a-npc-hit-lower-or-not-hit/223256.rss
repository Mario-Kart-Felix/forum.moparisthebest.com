    <description>Okay on my server Rock crabs hit WAY to high.
I need to fix that to mabey make them hit 2 at the highest.
Also when i use the mage bow you have to get right next to the npc to use that bow. How do i fix that?
Crystal bow your arms don&#39;t even move arrows come out but there not green either.
It&#39;d be cool if you can help thanks (:</description>
