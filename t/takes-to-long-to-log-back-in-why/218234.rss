    <title>Takes to Long to Log Back In, Why?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/takes-to-long-to-log-back-in-why/218234</link>
    <description>When there gets to be about 20 or more players on my server, after you logout it takes forever to log back in, you have to press the login button forever until you get lucky.  Is this because the run.bat is busy with all the other players saving and such or something else?

Thanks,
