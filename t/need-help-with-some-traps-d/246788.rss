    <title>Need Help with some TRAPS! =D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-some-traps-d/246788</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;ve created this Pk area on Kandor, and I want to make it so if you click on one of the mining rocks or plants you take a certain amount of damage while your being attacked or not attacked. 

Hope someone can help. =]</description>

              <p>I really don’t know exactly what to do, but I know when you want to click on something and make it do something. You go into client.java file. Then you see those case ###<span class="hashtag">#:</span> things you need to make one of those I don’t know what to put in it though. Mabye if you get the deltascape souce, and find the case ###<span class="hashtag">#:</span> for the exploading thing when you drop it you can edit that a little and that might work.</p>
