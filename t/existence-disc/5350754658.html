        <p>I personally believe in the teachings of Epicurus in that life’s telos (main objective/goal) is to experience pleasure (not necessarily physical pleasure, but higher order pleasure - pleasure of the mind). I believe this to be true because it appears that it is the only truly useful task someone can pursue in one’s life. It’s not a material possession and it will stay without as long as you’re alive. It’s also a tradition that can be passed down to others. Speaking of life, death is the absence of sensory input and cognition - so therefore said higher order pleasures are impossible.</p>

        <p>Life is cheap. It’s of little surprise, and little consequence, that most of it won’t achieve anything meaningful or noteworthy during its fleeting existence.<br>

        <p>We make an impact on the people around us. From birth we start our journey first impacting our parents and family, then moving on to making friends and having an impact on their daily lives. If you become someone significant like Mark Zuckerberg, you impact millions of people. You share adventures, journeys, have kids, find someone you love, and create a life for yourself. Throughout your live it is filled with various different emotions, ups and downs, like a roller coaster. Most people live with a day-to-day clock-in, clock-out job. We advance science and technologies to cure new diseases and make things easier. We launch giant buildings, facilities, small businesses, just to keep the world running. There are people in different countries who still have tin roofs, dirt floors, and a scarce food supply. However, they are part of the world, and part of humans, as is anyone. We get pets, whether it’s a dog, cat, giraffe, goat, chicken, or some fish. We have zoos, amusement parks, swimming pools, and public places to keep people happy and not focused on stress. We’re simply here to live, nothing more.</p>
<p>But then you realize that eventually, those zoos, amusement parks, swimming pools, and parks, will soon vanish. Those people in other countries with tin roofs, dirt floors, and scarce food supply, don’t impact the earth anymore, they will eventually die after they have lived their ran-down life. All of these giant buildings, facilities, small business, they will vanish and turn to rubble, only to be replaced with newer buildings, to keep us moving. That clock-in, clock-out job that you had will eventually run out of business, you will grow old and retire, living in a small area with your wife, as your kids, the next generation, are repeating the process. You will grow old, and you will vanish, die. Buried in the ground (or cremated) and left to rot, six feet under. Those adventures you had throughout life, and those memorable moments, times you were happy, and times you were sad… Will be gone. All of those people that you impacted, half of them are dead, and a majority of them won’t be here in 45 years. The happy times, joyful moments, and amazing adventures, will not matter for much longer. Your death may impact your family, close friends, and possibly others, but does it matter? They will all live the cycle as you have, and eventually, die.</p>
<p>Part of living life is hoping that you’ll make an impact on people, when in reality, only some people make an impact on the <span class="bbcode-i">world</span>. The rest of us? We’re just living. There is not much of a point in having good times, because when you die. You’ll have no recollection that any of them even existed. And those who partook in your good times, will eventually die. The world as we know it now, will be gone in 100 years. A majority of the people living now, will be gone in 100 years. We just repeat this cycle, create new generations, advance technology and science, and die. And then the next generation will do the same. Eventually, this will go on and on, until something will break the cycle. And the world will go back to being a dormant and in-habitable planet.</p>
<p>tl;dr - Life is pointless, though you may have good memories and times, they all vanish when you die. While most people believe you go into some after-life, in reality, you’re put in a hole, and left to rot. For some, your body is burned and put in an urn. In the end, we will die, everyone will die, and the ways we have progressed as a world, and impacts that we made, will vanish.</p>

<p>We all die? No shit man, <span class="bbcode-i">we’re the same decaying organic matter as everyone else, and we’re all part of the same compost pile</span>.</p>
<p>Does that mean life’s pointless? Nah. In my opinion it doesn’t matter that all of your good memories and ‘happy times’ will vanish when you’re dead, that’s no reason not to create good memories and happy times. It shouldn’t matter what impact you have on anything else, and you shouldn’t care about things on a universal scale when you can never be more than a human being. In fact, in part of your essay you mention “There is not much of a point in having good times, because when you die. You’ll have no recollection that any of them even existed. And those who partook in your good times, will eventually die.”. What you’re saying is correct, but if you really lived your life by those words you would be dead already.</p>
