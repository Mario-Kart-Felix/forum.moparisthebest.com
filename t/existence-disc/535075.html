        <p>But does happiness have any value considering how insignificant it is?</p>
<p>Going to go ahead and bump this.</p>
<p>Interesting thing I read today from Albert Camus, this is his version of The Myth of Sisyphus.<br>
It might be a little hard to read in this format, but I guarantee it’s worth the read.</p>
<blockquote>The Myth Of Sisyphus
<p>The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor.<br>
If one believes Homer, Sisyphus was the wisest and most prudent of mortals. According to another tradition, however, he was disposed to practice the profession of highwayman. I see no contradiction in this. Opinions differ as to the reasons why he became the futile laborer of the underworld. To begin with, he is accused of a certain levity in regard to the gods. He stole their secrets. Egina, the daughter of Esopus, was carried off by Jupiter. The father was shocked by that disappearance and complained to Sisyphus. He, who knew of the abduction, offered to tell about it on condition that Esopus would give water to the citadel of Corinth. To the celestial thunderbolts he preferred the benediction of water. He was punished for this in the underworld. Homer tells us also that Sisyphus had put Death in chains. Pluto could not endure the sight of his deserted, silent empire. He dispatched the god of war, who liberated Death from the hands of her conqueror.</p>
<p>It is said that Sisyphus, being near to death, rashly wanted to test his wife’s love. He ordered her to cast his unburied body into the middle of the public square. Sisyphus woke up in the underworld. And there, annoyed by an obedience so contrary to human love, he obtained from Pluto permission to return to earth in order to chastise his wife. But when he had seen again the face of this world, enjoyed water and sun, warm stones and the sea, he no longer wanted to go back to the infernal darkness. Recalls, signs of anger, warnings were of no avail. Many years more he lived facing the curve of the gulf, the sparkling sea, and the smiles of earth. A decree of the gods was necessary. Mercury came and seized the impudent man by the collar and, snatching him from his joys, lead him forcibly back to the underworld, where his rock was ready for him.</p>
<p>You have already grasped that Sisyphus is the absurd hero. He is, as much through his passions as through his torture. His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing. This is the price that must be paid for the passions of this earth. Nothing is told us about Sisyphus in the underworld. Myths are made for the imagination to breathe life into them. As for this myth, one sees merely the whole effort of a body straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it, and push it up a slope a hundred times over; one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone, the shoulder bracing the clay-covered mass, the foot wedging it, the fresh start with arms outstretched, the wholly human security of two earth-clotted hands. At the very end of his long effort measured by skyless space and time without depth, the purpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the stone rush down in a few moments toward that lower world whence he will have to push it up again toward the summit. He goes back down to the plain.</p>
<p>It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end. That hour like a breathing-space which returns as surely as his suffering, that is the hour of consciousness. At each of those moments when he leaves the heights and gradually sinks toward the lairs of the gods, he is superior to his fate. He is stronger than his rock.</p>
<p>If this myth is tragic, that is because its hero is conscious. Where would his torture be, indeed, if at every step the hope of succeeding upheld him? The workman of today works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious. Sisyphus, proletarian of the gods, powerless and rebellious, knows the whole extent of his wretched condition: it is what he thinks of during his descent. The lucidity that was to constitute his torture at the same time crowns his victory. There is no fate that can not be surmounted by scorn.</p>
<p>If the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place in joy. This word is not too much. Again I fancy Sisyphus returning toward his rock, and the sorrow was in the beginning. When the images of earth cling too tightly to memory, when the call of happiness becomes too insistent, it happens that melancholy arises in man’s heart: this is the rock’s victory, this is the rock itself. The boundless grief is too heavy to bear. These are our nights of Gethsemane. But crushing truths perish from being acknowledged. Thus, Edipus at the outset obeys fate without knowing it. But from the moment he knows, his tragedy begins. Yet at the same moment, blind and desperate, he realizes that the only bond linking him to the world is the cool hand of a girl. Then a tremendous remark rings out: “Despite so many ordeals, my advanced age and the nobility of my soul make me conclude that all is well.” Sophocles’ Edipus, like Dostoevsky’s Kirilov, thus gives the recipe for the absurd victory. Ancient wisdom confirms modern heroism.</p>
<p>One does not discover the absurd without being tempted to write a manual of happiness. “What!—by such narrow ways–?” There is but one world, however. Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth. They are inseparable. It would be a mistake to say that happiness necessarily springs from the absurd. discovery. It happens as well that the felling of the absurd springs from happiness. “I conclude that all is well,” says Edipus, and that remark is sacred. It echoes in the wild and limited universe of man. It teaches that all is not, has not been, exhausted. It drives out of this world a god who had come into it with dissatisfaction and a preference for futile suffering. It makes of fate a human matter, which must be settled among men.</p>
<p>All Sisyphus’ silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to him. His rock is a thing Likewise, the absurd man, when he contemplates his torment, silences all the idols. In the universe suddenly restored to its silence, the myriad wondering little voices of the earth rise up. Unconscious, secret calls, invitations from all the faces, they are the necessary reverse and price of victory. There is no sun without shadow, and it is essential to know the night. The absurd man says yes and his efforts will henceforth be unceasing. If there is a personal fate, there is no higher destiny, or at least there is, but one which he concludes is inevitable and despicable. For the rest, he knows himself to be the master of his days. At that subtle moment when man glances backward over his life, Sisyphus returning toward his rock, in that slight pivoting he contemplates that series of unrelated actions which become his fate, created by him, combined under his memory’s eye and soon sealed by his death. Thus, convinced of the wholly human origin of all that is human, a blind man eager to see who knows that the night has no end, he is still on the go. The rock is still rolling.</p>
<p>I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one’s burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.</p>
<p>—Albert Camus</p>

<p>For some background to help you know where I’m coming from, I recently thought of this: The universe existed for 13.8 billion years before you were born and will continue to exist long after. What effect can you possibly have on that, or on anything?

<p>The more you search for a real meaning to life, the more you will realize that there is none. Any one human life is completely irrelevant on the grand scale of the universe.</p>
<p>The philosophical belief that there is no value to human life (or any life for that matter) is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_nihilism" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Existential Nihilism</a> (also read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Nihilism</a>), which was popularized by one of my favorite philosophers, Friedrich Nietzsche. The philosophy mainly emphasizes the fact that there is no inherent meaning to life, and that humans will search for one indefinitely to no avail.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism#Existential_nihilism:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Existential nihilism is the belief that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. With respect to the universe, existential nihilism posits that a single human or even the entire human species is insignificant, without purpose and unlikely to change in the totality of existence. The meaninglessness of life is largely explored in the philosophical school of existentialism.</p>

        <p>The universe was kind enough to give us life, don’t waste it by thinking we have no purpose, because we very much do. Our very own existence is one in zillion, every opportunity taken, every leaf turned, every single person your parents are ancestors met resulted in you, what are the chances out of that? I believe that our very existence in life is not meaningless, because we choose to create our meaning. The universe created our nature you see all around you, and nature created the 7 meanings of life which are MRSGREN and resulted in Earths many life forms. What is there left to do? Well the answer is simple, create more life. Now when I talk about creating more life, I don’t mean reproducing offspring, I mean create your own idea for having a purpose in life. What is life? Is it being conscious or aware of what we’re doing? I like to think it is an idea of your very existence, manipulating activities, thoughts, wants and needs to fit your ideal for a happy life. You see the cycle of life is to create an idea in which you want to do in life, your hobbies, your duties, your responsibilities are all apart of you creating life, so how far away from that are you? The matter of fact is that we’re all doing it right now, we’re all creating our own, life.</p>
<p>Short version; your existence is what you make it.</p>

<p>But does happiness have any value considering how insignificant it is?</p>

</aside>
<p>Which would you prefer? to be happy, or to be unhappy? Certainly one has more value over the other. In the end it won’t matter, but I prefer living in the “now”</p>

        <p>[quote=“TabbyKiller, post:5, topic:535075”]The universe was kind enough to give us life, don’t waste it by thinking we have no purpose, because we very much do. Our very own existence is one in zillion, every opportunity taken, every leaf turned, every single person your parents are ancestors met resulted in you, what are the chances out of that? I believe that our very existence in life is not meaningless, because we choose to create our meaning. The universe created our nature you see all around you, and nature created the 7 meanings of life which are MRSGREN and resulted in Earths many life forms. What is there left to do? Well the answer is simple, create more life. Now when I talk about creating more life, I don’t mean reproducing offspring, I mean create your own idea for having a purpose in life. What is life? Is it being conscious or aware of what we’re doing? I like to think it is an idea of your very existence, manipulating activities, thoughts, wants and needs to fit your ideal for a happy life. You see the cycle of life is to create an idea in which you want to do in life, your hobbies, your duties, your responsibilities are all apart of you creating life, so how far away from that are you? The matter of fact is that we’re all doing it right now, we’re all creating our own, life.</p>
<p>Short version; your existence is what you make it.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, the odds of any one person existing are <a href="http://visual.ly/what-are-odds" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">astronomical</a>. That much is true, but it isn’t necessarily wasting life by believing that there is no purpose to it. The cool thing about existential nihilism is that it details exactly what you have stated; people choose to create their own meaning. However, it also realizes that there is no true (universal) meaning to life. It says that the meaning to life is subjective, not objective.</p>

        <p>Ah, yeah, thank you very much for your replies. I did a lot of research on existentialism and it turns out that my ideology aligns with it quite closely. I’ve enjoyed researching it quite a lot.<br>
Sartre’s “Existentialism is a Humanism” was wonderful to read.</p>

        <p>Happiness has value to us, and that’s all we need unless we become something else. We don’t need a purpose in the grand scheme of things because we don’t exist to give a purpose to existence. We give purpose to our own existence and I think that’s enough.</p>

<p>I agree with this statement but at the same time can’t help but to wonder, is our purpose happiness? If that’s all we have to hold and achieve, happiness with our lives and how we’re living, isn’t that our purpose?</p>

        <p>The universe doesn’t care about our existence, the planet doesn’t care, animals don’t care.<br>
Only we as humans are conscious and care.<br>
We’re just a accident, and no matter how big we get as humanity eventually we will all be gone at some point.<br>
The existence of humanity or any life form has no meaning at all.<br>
People love to believe there is a meaning to their lives, but seriously, at one point humanity will be extincted, your life doesn’t have any value at all.</p>
