    <title>Existence (Disc.)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/existence-disc/535075</link>
    <description>It recently occurred to me that, after all previous efforts to avoid this conclusion, my life has no importance.

I don&#39;t mean to say that life isn&#39;t meaningful; I&#39;m trying more to stress that in general, lives are not significant.

For some background to help you know where I&#39;m coming from, I recently thought of this: The universe existed for 13.8 billion years before you were born and will continue to exist long after. What effect can you possibly have on that, or on anything? Does happiness have any actual value, or does it not matter in the greater scheme whether you&#39;re happy or not because you&#39;re simply insignificant?

I&#39;d love to hear everybody&#39;s thoughts on this</description>

              <p>[quote=“The Web Guy, post:24, topic:535075”][spoiler]We make an impact on the people around us. From birth we start our journey first impacting our parents and family, then moving on to making friends and having an impact on their daily lives. If you become someone significant like Mark Zuckerberg, you impact millions of people. You share adventures, journeys, have kids, find someone you love, and create a life for yourself. Throughout your live it is filled with various different emotions, ups and downs, like a roller coaster. Most people live with a day-to-day clock-in, clock-out job. We advance science and technologies to cure new diseases and make things easier. We launch giant buildings, facilities, small businesses, just to keep the world running. There are people in different countries who still have tin roofs, dirt floors, and a scarce food supply. However, they are part of the world, and part of humans, as is anyone. We get pets, whether it’s a dog, cat, giraffe, goat, chicken, or some fish. We have zoos, amusement parks, swimming pools, and public places to keep people happy and not focused on stress. We’re simply here to live, nothing more.</p>
<p>But then you realize that eventually, those zoos, amusement parks, swimming pools, and parks, will soon vanish. Those people in other countries with tin roofs, dirt floors, and scarce food supply, don’t impact the earth anymore, they will eventually die after they have lived their ran-down life. All of these giant buildings, facilities, small business, they will vanish and turn to rubble, only to be replaced with newer buildings, to keep us moving. That clock-in, clock-out job that you had will eventually run out of business, you will grow old and retire, living in a small area with your wife, as your kids, the next generation, are repeating the process. You will grow old, and you will vanish, die. Buried in the ground (or cremated) and left to rot, six feet under. Those adventures you had throughout life, and those memorable moments, times you were happy, and times you were sad… Will be gone. All of those people that you impacted, half of them are dead, and a majority of them won’t be here in 45 years. The happy times, joyful moments, and amazing adventures, will not matter for much longer. Your death may impact your family, close friends, and possibly others, but does it matter? They will all live the cycle as you have, and eventually, die.</p>
<p>Part of living life is hoping that you’ll make an impact on people, when in reality, only some people make an impact on the <span class="bbcode-i">world</span>. The rest of us? We’re just living. There is not much of a point in having good times, because when you die. You’ll have no recollection that any of them even existed. And those who partook in your good times, will eventually die. The world as we know it now, will be gone in 100 years. A majority of the people living now, will be gone in 100 years. We just repeat this cycle, create new generations, advance technology and science, and die. And then the next generation will do the same. Eventually, this will go on and on, until something will break the cycle. And the world will go back to being a dormant and in-habitable planet.[/spoiler]</p>
<p>tl;dr - Life is pointless, though you may have good memories and times, they all vanish when you die. While most people believe you go into some after-life, in reality, you’re put in a hole, and left to rot. For some, your body is burned and put in an urn. In the end, we will die, everyone will die, and the ways we have progressed as a world, and impacts that we made, will vanish.[/quote]</p>
<p>We all die? No shit man, <span class="bbcode-i">we’re the same decaying organic matter as everyone else, and we’re all part of the same compost pile</span>.</p>
<p>Does that mean life’s pointless? Nah. In my opinion it doesn’t matter that all of your good memories and ‘happy times’ will vanish when you’re dead, that’s no reason not to create good memories and happy times. It shouldn’t matter what impact you have on anything else, and you shouldn’t care about things on a universal scale when you can never be more than a human being. In fact, in part of your essay you mention “There is not much of a point in having good times, because when you die. You’ll have no recollection that any of them even existed. And those who partook in your good times, will eventually die.”. What you’re saying is correct, but if you really lived your life by those words you would be dead already.</p>

              <p>I personally believe in the teachings of Epicurus in that life’s telos (main objective/goal) is to experience pleasure (not necessarily physical pleasure, but higher order pleasure - pleasure of the mind). I believe this to be true because it appears that it is the only truly useful task someone can pursue in one’s life. It’s not a material possession and it will stay without as long as you’re alive. It’s also a tradition that can be passed down to others. Speaking of life, death is the absence of sensory input and cognition - so therefore said higher order pleasures are impossible.</p>

<p>I can understand that, but at the same time there has to be a goal that we strive for… which I think is happiness in our own life. Gotta make the best of what we have here before we die.</p>

<p>Yes, the odds of any one person existing are <a href="http://visual.ly/what-are-odds" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">astronomical</a>. That much is true, but it isn’t necessarily wasting life by believing that there is no purpose to it. The cool thing about existential nihilism is that it details exactly what you have stated; people choose to create their own meaning. However, it also realizes that there is no true (universal) meaning to life. It says that the meaning to life is subjective, not objective.</p>

<p>Existential nihilism is the belief that life has no intrinsic meaning or value.

              <p>But does happiness have any value considering how insignificant it is?</p>
<p>Going to go ahead and bump this.</p>
<p>Interesting thing I read today from Albert Camus, this is his version of The Myth of Sisyphus.<br>
It might be a little hard to read in this format, but I guarantee it’s worth the read.</p>
<blockquote>The Myth Of Sisyphus
<p>The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor.<br>
If one believes Homer, Sisyphus was the wisest and most prudent of mortals. According to another tradition, however, he was disposed to practice the profession of highwayman. I see no contradiction in this. Opinions differ as to the reasons why he became the futile laborer of the underworld. To begin with, he is accused of a certain levity in regard to the gods. He stole their secrets. Egina, the daughter of Esopus, was carried off by Jupiter. The father was shocked by that disappearance and complained to Sisyphus. He, who knew of the abduction, offered to tell about it on condition that Esopus would give water to the citadel of Corinth. To the celestial thunderbolts he preferred the benediction of water. He was punished for this in the underworld. Homer tells us also that Sisyphus had put Death in chains. Pluto could not endure the sight of his deserted, silent empire. He dispatched the god of war, who liberated Death from the hands of her conqueror.</p>
<p>It is said that Sisyphus, being near to death, rashly wanted to test his wife’s love. He ordered her to cast his unburied body into the middle of the public square. Sisyphus woke up in the underworld. And there, annoyed by an obedience so contrary to human love, he obtained from Pluto permission to return to earth in order to chastise his wife. But when he had seen again the face of this world, enjoyed water and sun, warm stones and the sea, he no longer wanted to go back to the infernal darkness. Recalls, signs of anger, warnings were of no avail. Many years more he lived facing the curve of the gulf, the sparkling sea, and the smiles of earth. A decree of the gods was necessary. Mercury came and seized the impudent man by the collar and, snatching him from his joys, lead him forcibly back to the underworld, where his rock was ready for him.</p>
<p>You have already grasped that Sisyphus is the absurd hero. He is, as much through his passions as through his torture. His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing. This is the price that must be paid for the passions of this earth. Nothing is told us about Sisyphus in the underworld. Myths are made for the imagination to breathe life into them. As for this myth, one sees merely the whole effort of a body straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it, and push it up a slope a hundred times over; one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone, the shoulder bracing the clay-covered mass, the foot wedging it, the fresh start with arms outstretched, the wholly human security of two earth-clotted hands. At the very end of his long effort measured by skyless space and time without depth, the purpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the stone rush down in a few moments toward that lower world whence he will have to push it up again toward the summit. He goes back down to the plain.</p>
<p>It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end. That hour like a breathing-space which returns as surely as his suffering, that is the hour of consciousness. At each of those moments when he leaves the heights and gradually sinks toward the lairs of the gods, he is superior to his fate. He is stronger than his rock.</p>
<p>If this myth is tragic, that is because its hero is conscious. Where would his torture be, indeed, if at every step the hope of succeeding upheld him? The workman of today works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious. Sisyphus, proletarian of the gods, powerless and rebellious, knows the whole extent of his wretched condition: it is what he thinks of during his descent. The lucidity that was to constitute his torture at the same time crowns his victory. There is no fate that can not be surmounted by scorn.</p>
<p>If the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place in joy. This word is not too much. Again I fancy Sisyphus returning toward his rock, and the sorrow was in the beginning. When the images of earth cling too tightly to memory, when the call of happiness becomes too insistent, it happens that melancholy arises in man’s heart: this is the rock’s victory, this is the rock itself. The boundless grief is too heavy to bear. These are our nights of Gethsemane. But crushing truths perish from being acknowledged. Thus, Edipus at the outset obeys fate without knowing it. But from the moment he knows, his tragedy begins. Yet at the same moment, blind and desperate, he realizes that the only bond linking him to the world is the cool hand of a girl. Then a tremendous remark rings out: “Despite so many ordeals, my advanced age and the nobility of my soul make me conclude that all is well.” Sophocles’ Edipus, like Dostoevsky’s Kirilov, thus gives the recipe for the absurd victory. Ancient wisdom confirms modern heroism.</p>
<p>One does not discover the absurd without being tempted to write a manual of happiness. “What!—by such narrow ways–?” There is but one world, however. Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth. They are inseparable. It would be a mistake to say that happiness necessarily springs from the absurd. discovery. It happens as well that the felling of the absurd springs from happiness. “I conclude that all is well,” says Edipus, and that remark is sacred. It echoes in the wild and limited universe of man. It teaches that all is not, has not been, exhausted. It drives out of this world a god who had come into it with dissatisfaction and a preference for futile suffering. It makes of fate a human matter, which must be settled among men.</p>
<p>All Sisyphus’ silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to him. His rock is a thing Likewise, the absurd man, when he contemplates his torment, silences all the idols. In the universe suddenly restored to its silence, the myriad wondering little voices of the earth rise up. Unconscious, secret calls, invitations from all the faces, they are the necessary reverse and price of victory. There is no sun without shadow, and it is essential to know the night. The absurd man says yes and his efforts will henceforth be unceasing. If there is a personal fate, there is no higher destiny, or at least there is, but one which he concludes is inevitable and despicable. For the rest, he knows himself to be the master of his days. At that subtle moment when man glances backward over his life, Sisyphus returning toward his rock, in that slight pivoting he contemplates that series of unrelated actions which become his fate, created by him, combined under his memory’s eye and soon sealed by his death. Thus, convinced of the wholly human origin of all that is human, a blind man eager to see who knows that the night has no end, he is still on the go. The rock is still rolling.</p>
<p>I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one’s burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to say that life isn’t meaningful; I’m trying more to stress that in general, lives are not significant.</p>
<p>For some background to help you know where I’m coming from, I recently thought of this: The universe existed for 13.8 billion years before you were born and will continue to exist long after. What effect can you possibly have on that, or on anything? Does happiness have any actual value, or does it not matter in the greater scheme whether you’re happy or not because you’re simply insignificant?</p>
<p>I’d love to hear everybody’s thoughts on this</p>
