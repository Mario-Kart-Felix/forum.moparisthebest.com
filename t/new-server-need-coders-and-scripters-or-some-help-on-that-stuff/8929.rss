    <title>New server need coders and scripters or some help on that stuff</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-server-need-coders-and-scripters-or-some-help-on-that-stuff/8929</link>
    <description>yeah like i said i need help on entering the codes and stuff cause i tried going on to the file characters (this is megascape btw) and i looked at my characters txt file and edited it to 99 stats and stuff but it wont save for some reason and i need to know how to spawn monsters and items and stuff like that with the text saving when i click save on &quot;file&quot;. help would be appreciated and if you are willing to stick around ill make you a admin or mod its your choice. oh yeah and uh how would i make commands that work in the game and get rid of commands? 

server is either dark-scape.no-ip.org or 5.56.197.107

need hamachi for this though.....server name in hamachi or network name is dark-scape.no-ip.org password is darkscape


ok server is now under construction of project 16 instead of megascape will be done either tommarrow (august 9th) this is western time ...megascape server is finished and like i said project 16 version is like dark-scape2 ...this server requires hamachi as i said and the network is dark-scape.no-ip.org the password is darkscape and i made a second one just in case i need it it is dark-scape2.no-ip.org and password is darkscape. in file in &quot;new server&quot; put in 5.56.197.107..thanks to those people that have been on my server. i am glad u like it
