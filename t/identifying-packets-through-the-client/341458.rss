    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/identifying-packets-through-the-client/341458</link>
    <description>Hey for my 601/602 i need to be able to identify the packet things. The packets in a 601/602 are from 0 - 256 and the size ranges from -3  -  20&#39;ish? lol.. it can go lower and higher but i wudnt..

 i need to know how to look into the client and identify which code is the packet method and then i can identify the streams needed to get the packet operational.</description>
