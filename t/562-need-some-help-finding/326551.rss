    <description>Um hey I&#39;ve been looking around in Google, and within like 5 minutes I found 562 source and client. I got it working, but in most off the releases they give credit&#39;s to tut&#39;s, now I&#39;ve been trying to find these tuts. Anyone have a link to one? Please and thank you. Sorry for the spelling, I&#39;ve been at this a while, so much harder then 508.


Thank you pure demons for correcting my spelling was little drunk that night.. :D</description>
