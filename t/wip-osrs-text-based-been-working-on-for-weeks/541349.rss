    <title>[WIP] OSRS text-based been working on for weeks!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wip-osrs-text-based-been-working-on-for-weeks/541349</link>
    <description>Okay so I have been working on this development for a couple of weeks and I think that there are very few bugs now, (none that i&#39;m aware of however) so I think it is ready to be released to the public. 

[b]Some key features include:[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Working Chat box - from scratch. With AJAX functionality (added today)
News Feed
Registration is simple
AdminCP - started&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b]Things which are going to be added[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;The game (obviously) i&#39;ve been focusing on the chat box and homepage
Highscores (will come out in the Beta of the game)
a &quot;Grand Market&quot; like the grand exchange (to show prices not to sell, players will be able to trade other players)
More will be posted on the website.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you have been working on it for weeks and only have this (little) amount of progress, that’s not much.<br>

<p>I may have spoken too soon actually, after looking more into the forums there is a little more information and images with where the game stands, good luck with the development Marc.</p>
