              <p>Are you talking about what just happened recently in 2011?</p>
<blockquote>I logged on this morning to find one of the PHP files for SMF changed, approximately 36 hours ago from now exactly. I shut down all access to the server immediately to investigate the issue, and have been working on it ever since (about 14 hours straight now). The code was already disabled (by the attacker) and he could have gotten plain-text passwords from anyone who actually logged-in to the forums during the 24 hours before that (if you had a cookie and just stayed logged in, and didn't type your password, you are safe). However, he also dumped the members table, and so he has all of the password hashes from the forum, but they should be fairly secure from brute forcing, as they are sha1 hashes complete with per-user salts, so rainbow tables can't be used.
<p>Technical information:<br>
They apparently got in through some type of PHP exploit, as they only had access to the www-data user. I’ve patched this by disabling all questionable php functions, including eval with the suhosin patch, and then patching all my software not to use eval and such. Right now, PHP can’t even write to any directories, so not even attachments will work until I find some more information about this.</p>
