    <title>Mac OSX Client (linux too) that Doesn&#39;t Crash after 2 Steps</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mac-osx-client-linux-too-that-doesnt-crash-after-2-steps/354012</link>
    <description>After searching long, and hard I found a client that runs on my mac smoothly.

So I have decided to post it, to the community that has helped me out... I guess...

In the main Davids-file folder, I have included the commands to run it on mac (and also linux, I believe).

You can download it at [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?2u231265kmc2vcb]http://www.mediafire.com/?2u231265kmc2vcb[/url]
(sorry about the size... I think that it is worth it though)

Credit:
6.5% Me (for uploading it, putting stuff in so you can run it)
The other 93.5%:
 -Guys at Ownage-Pkz that made the client
 -Simdog1 and Dim3000 of Ubuntu Forums (guys who figured out the code to run it)-&gt; [url=http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9481489]http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9481489[/url] (sorry if I am not supposed to link to other forums, just trying to give them credit)

This helped me out a ton, hope it helps you out too

Btw this works on practically every platform... There is a .bat to run it on windows, and the code to run it on mac &amp; linux.</description>
