    <title>Complete new webclient setup</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/complete-new-webclient-setup/409683</link>
    <description>Hey guys, thanks for taking the time out to read this.
Okay, here is what I need help with. 
I would like someone to help me make a webclient. I have a webhost and what not, that&#39;s no trouble. I have tried and tried before to make one, but I seem to have problems with cache downloading, and running the server. Port forwarding is not a problem and i use no-ip too.
So, is there someone on the board that is able to help me to create a fully functional webclient that i can just upload to my webpage and host? If it works, and people can connect to it, i will probably pay you a few M rsgp. 
Source is not a problem, but I would like it to have donator options and easily customaizable messages. 

Thank you. :)</description>
