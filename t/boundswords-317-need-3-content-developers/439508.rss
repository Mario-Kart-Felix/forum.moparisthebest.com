I have a purchased domain for 1 year, &quot;Boundswords.com&quot;. I plan to make some use of it. The hosting has ended, however once we finish everything up and are ready to enter the beta stage I will create some more banners/advertisements to get us players to test bugs/glitches/dupes. I will purchase hosting, and we will need to have a webclient made aswell when beta is released.
I&#39;m not going to make a fancy thread, no need for that.

Basically I&#39;m a decent rsps coder, however I do need some help, and with a development team we could finish the server/client so much faster.

I need someone who has almost complete knowledge in client &amp; server developing.
We will be using runesource, and a 317 packaged client.

Things I have added:
Gem crafting (Doesn&#39;t give experience yet)

Fixed an interface bug, displaying the wrong interface for wielding weapons.
