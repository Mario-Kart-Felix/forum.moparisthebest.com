    <title>Just bought an alienware M14X laptop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-bought-an-alienware-m14x-laptop/396222</link>
    <description>Well I am going off to college next year and I need a laptop for school since ive been living with a desktop only for over a year. I wanted something that I could use to do school work and also use while I&#39;m away from home for gaming (for instance when I visit my parents and there is nothing to do in the small town they live). I was looking at getting a custom notebook from xoticpc.com (a sager notebook) - 15 inch - same specs but higher resolution screen (1920X1080) vs (1600x900) and it had a slightly better card (460m) vs (555) but I questioned the build quality of the notebook and the size was larger than the 14inch, it had a couple more pounds of weight, and note to mention it didn&#39;t look the best. But all in all with taxes it came out to be the same price (maybe a tad more) than the custom notebook I was going to get. I thought the alienware (dell) was going to be overpriced but I think it was good for what I am getting, theres not another 14inch notebook on the market with the graphics card that mine is coming with.

Here is the exact specs.

Alienware M14X - Stealth Black with Soft Touch Finish
Intel Core i7 2630QM 2.0GHz (2.9GHz Turbo Mode, 6M cache)
4GB Dual Channel DDR3 at 1600MHz
Alienware M14X 150W A/C Adapter
14.0 High Def+ (900p/1600x900) with WLED backlight
3.0GB DDR3 NVIDIA GeForce GT 555M using NVIDIA Optimus technology
500GB 7200RPM SATA 3GB/s
Custom Nameplate
Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium, 64bit, English
Slot-Load Dual Layer DVD Burner, DVD+-RW, CD-RW
Internal High-Definition 5.1 Surround Sound Audio
Intel Advanced-N WiFi Link 6205 a/g/n 2x2 MIMO Technology

Let me know what you think, without tax it came out to be $1390
http://www.dell.com/us/p/alienware-m14x/pd.aspx


Also I ordered it about a week ago an it said the estimated delivery date was at the middle of next month 6/13/2011 or 13/6/2011 and I thought a month just to get a laptop was crazy, but I checked today and it says it should be delivered Friday so im pretty excited because thats a little under 2 weeks.

EDIT: Also I just wanted to let everybody know that I ripped myself off because I could have got 2gb more of ram (6b) and 250gb more of storage (750gb) for the same price but I didnt see they had a M14X in the featured system sections off the alienware site which had $175 (the ram and the storage) Its probably not a noticeable improvement over mine but it would have been nice to get all of the extra space for free (no biggie) I am still happy with what I got and I was planning on switching to a solid slate drive eventually anyway.</description>

Sexy, I have a Dell Studio 17 laptop, just below the Alienware laptop range, slightly less powerful than what you have there, but I can play all modern games + crysis 2 with good framerates so it’s cool.</p>
<p>Don’t think you got too bad value for your money really, mine cost £700, which is £150 less than what yours converts to, woulda thought they’d put a 640gb or 750gb HDD in it as default though <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"><br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah I was going to get a studio xps 15 but the graphics card was a mid range 525 and I wanted the higher end 555. But yeah if I would have looked in the featured systems section of the alienware sited I could have got 750gb and 6gb ram for free but no big deal. The ram isnt much of and improvement but I could have used the extra hd space for installing games.[/quote]<br>
Aah fair enough, mine’s got a dual bay so I bought an additional 640gb <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Nevertheless, looks like and alright laptop.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah there desktops are overpriced. I looked at these when I was building my desktop, but now that I actually had to research laptops and compare pricing between companies dell alienware laptops really aren’t that far off in pricing especially now that I see they have the m14x in the featured system section standard with 6gb @ 1600mhz and 750 gb hd for the price I paid for 4gb and 500gb hd.  Still may be 70 dollars more than a comparable competitor but ill blame that on all the little led lights and shit.</p>

              <p>whats annoying is you can get the 11" one with 16GB of RAM but you can only get 8 in the 14" one? the 11" one works out a better deal on the uk site when i last looked iirc you got more for the same price</p>

<p>Thats alright your a dumb-ass in general so I don’t feel so bad.</p>
<p>To get a MacBook with nearly the equivalent specs it would cost an unreasonable amount more. Obviously you don’t know shit about the actual pricing of computer components. You cant find another laptop with equivalent size, specifications, and durability for that price. Now go fuck off and spout more nVidia fan-boy bullshit in other threads and get flamed.</p>

              <p>Well I am going off to college next year and I need a laptop for school since ive been living with a desktop only for over a year. I wanted something that I could use to do school work and also use while I’m away from home for gaming (for instance when I visit my parents and there is nothing to do in the small town they live). I was looking at getting a custom notebook from <a href="http://xoticpc.com" rel="nofollow noopener">xoticpc.com</a> (a sager notebook) - 15 inch - same specs but higher resolution screen (1920X1080) vs (1600x900) and it had a slightly better card (460m) vs (555) but I questioned the build quality of the notebook and the size was larger than the 14inch, it had a couple more pounds of weight, and note to mention it didn’t look the best. But all in all with taxes it came out to be the same price (maybe a tad more) than the custom notebook I was going to get. I thought the alienware (dell) was going to be overpriced but I think it was good for what I am getting, theres not another 14inch notebook on the market with the graphics card that mine is coming with.</p>
<p>Here is the exact specs.</p>
<p>Alienware M14X - Stealth Black with Soft Touch Finish<br>
Intel Core i7 2630QM 2.0GHz (2.9GHz Turbo Mode, 6M cache)<br>
4GB Dual Channel DDR3 at 1600MHz<br>
Alienware M14X 150W A/C Adapter<br>
14.0 High Def+ (900p/1600x900) with WLED backlight<br>
3.0GB DDR3 NVIDIA GeForce GT 555M using NVIDIA Optimus technology<br>
500GB 7200RPM SATA 3GB/s<br>
Custom Nameplate<br>
Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium, 64bit, English<br>
Slot-Load Dual Layer DVD Burner, DVD±RW, CD-RW<br>
Internal High-Definition 5.1 Surround Sound Audio<br>
Intel Advanced-N WiFi Link 6205 a/g/n 2x2 MIMO Technology</p>
<p>Let me know what you think, without tax it came out to be $1390<br>

<p>Also I ordered it about a week ago an it said the estimated delivery date was at the middle of next month 6/13/2011 or 13/6/2011 and I thought a month just to get a laptop was crazy, but I checked today and it says it should be delivered Friday so im pretty excited because thats a little under 2 weeks.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also I just wanted to let everybody know that I ripped myself off because I could have got 2gb more of ram (6b) and 250gb more of storage (750gb) for the same price but I didnt see they had a M14X in the featured system sections off the alienware site which had $175 (the ram and the storage) Its probably not a noticeable improvement over mine but it would have been nice to get all of the extra space for free (no biggie) I am still happy with what I got and I was planning on switching to a solid slate drive eventually anyway.</p>
