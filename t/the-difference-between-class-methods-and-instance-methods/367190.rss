    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-difference-between-class-methods-and-instance-methods/367190</link>
    <description>What is the difference? Our class project is on it and we have no idea what these are. THANK

p.s. I know we can have a class &quot;blueprint&quot; of something such as a bike:

public class Bicycle{
  Private int cadence;
  Private int gear;
  Private int speed;
}

then we can instantiate it by going:

Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle()

what are methods exactly???</description>

              <p>[quote=“Mr.Chris, post:13, topic:367190”]On the same sort of topic, could someone explain to me how the keyword “this” works?[/quote]If you look at it from a bytecode perspective, it might be easier to digest. Every bytecode instruction that references a member within an object is preceded by pushing the object which encapsulates the referenced member onto the stack. In instance methods, the current class object is stored in local variable index ‘0’, and thus anytime the method references a member within the current object, the instruction is preceded by an “ALOAD_0” (this instruction holds the format ALOAD_&lt;LOCAL_VARIABLE_TABLE_INDEX&gt; - ALOAD refers to the fact that it’s pushing an object onto the stack, and the fact that we’re referencing index 0 means we are pushing the current instance onto the stack (as stated before)). This current object it’s referring to is what the keyword ‘this’ specifies when it is used. It is most likely being appended in the bytecode anyways, so its use is primarily when variable-name ambiguity exists (like the example Fat_Cookies gave where the two parameters have the same name as the instance fields). So technically, bytecode-wise, “this.instanceMethod()/instanceField” and “instanceMethod()/instanceField” are exactly identical and do not change the code’s functionality.</p>
<p>From a more visual perspective, suppose we have the following class:</p>
<p>[code=java]<br>
class Test {</p>
<pre><code>public int getTestVar() {
    return testVar;
}

private int testVar;
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code] The ‘getTestVar()’ function would be compiled into the following bytecode:</p>
<p><code>
ALOAD_0 // load current class object, in other words 'this'
GETFIELD &lt;....testVar&gt; //get the 'testVar' instance field within the object pushed onto the stack in the previous instruction (which is now popped) and push it onto the stack
IRETURN //return the integral value on top of the stack (in this case, it would return 'testVar')
</code>If you returned “this.testVar” in the function, it would produce the same exact bytecode.</p>
<p>edit: I apologize if this only confused you more, but if you actually managed to understand this, it will have given you a more in-depth understanding on why and when the ‘this’ keyword should explicitly be used.</p>

<p>It basically points to the object that the class creates.<br>
It’s most practical use is when you want to store the constructors parameters as class variables.<br>
Take this example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class Bob {
    
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Bob(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        
        name = "THIS IS NOT A FUCKING STRING";
        age = 999999;
        
       System.out.println("this.name = "+this.name+"\nname = "+name);
       System.out.println("this.age = "+this.age+"\nage = "+age);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bob bob = new Bob("A String", 123);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This code would print:</p>
<p>this.name = A String<br>
name = THIS IS NOT A FUCKING STRING<br>
this.age = 123<br>
age =  999999</p>
<p>the this keyword was used to identify that we want the <span class="bbcode-s">global variable</span> object variable instead of the local one inside the constructor. You can also use this for methods within a class so this.aMethod() is valid too.</p>

<p>That’s how I would compare the two:</p>
<p>The classMethod is static which multiplies two numbers together. It gets its input via the parameters int i and int j. It belongs to the class and will behave exactly the same every time you execute it aslong as the parameters are the same.</p>
<p>The instanceMethod belongs to an instance FuckingMultiplication(FuckingMultiplication fm = new FuckingMultiplication(2,3);). When you execute this it will take the values int fuck and int me from the object and multiple them together. When you run this the result depends on which integers you passed through the constructor when you instantiated the object.</p>
<p>To use you’re Dog analogy. A suitable instance method would be walk(), feed(), kill() since these actions are all related to one object (the dog). A suitable class method would be, holdDogRave(), forgetWhatADogLooksLike() since these methods are not related to one specfiic dog but to “Dog” in general.</p>
<p>That probably didn’t make any sense, but meh.</p>

<p>“Lassie” (the Class) isn’t an instance - it’s another class which inherits from Dog. That’s why it has the Dog methods.</p>
<p>lassieInstance is an instance of Lassie - in other words, the class describes what a Lassie is, the instance IS a Lassie.</p>
<p>We could just as easily create an instance of Dog (Dog d = new Dog()) and it would be a Dog, not a lassie, so it owuld just have the Dog methods.</p>
<p>EDIT: also, using your dog example, bark(), wagTail() and walk() would likely be normal/instance methods, not class/static methods. you want a specific instance of dog to bark, not the dog class itself.</p>

              <p>thepinksock: I don’t know how it is in other language, but in Actionscript you can easy use class methods without making an instance. Like the Math class. You don’t make a Math object, you just use it directly in your code. So if you have some functions you don’t feel fit into a instance you use static functions.</p>
<p>You see that<br>
var x = Math.PI * Math.pow(radius,2);<br>
Is much easier than<br>
var math = new Math();<br>
var x = math.PI * math.pow(radius,2);<br>
Maybe that you meant by “utility” methods, I don’t know.</p>
<p>Since we are talking about Ducks I will show an example how you can use Class functions and Class variables to sqeeze an army of ducks.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">package 
{
	public class Duck
	{
		static private var Ducks:Array = new Array(); // List of Ducks;
		static private var i:Number = 0; // To count ducks;
//  This put all Ducks into an Array so I can use functions on them.
		public function Duck()
		{

			i++;
			Ducks[i] = this;

		}
// For squeezing all you ducks.
		static public function squeezeAll()
		{
			var i = 0; // Just a local i, no connection to static i (If I did it right);
			while (i &lt; Ducks.length)
			{
				Ducks[i].squeeze();
				i++;
			}
		}
// For squeezing a single Duck.
		public function squeeze()
		{
			trace("KVAKK");
		}
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>Not elegant like Ruby, but will do its work.</p>
<p>Maybe you have better ideas about how to use it, but that was one idea.</p>

              <p>So far I have got that class methods are only used as “utility” methods such as keeping a count of how many instances of the class are currently in existence.</p>
<p>Instance methods are simply the only methods that an instance of the class can access and are things that the object can do e.g. dogs tail state can be set to wagging.</p>
<p>So that’s the difference now we have to make a whole A1 size poster on that. Guess we’ll bulk it out with the definition of classes and instances.</p>
<p>edit - okay I really don’t get it now, so confused, when would a class method be used instead of an instance and vice vers</p>

this class defines a type of object, specifically a rubber ducky. the instance methods, squeeze() and release(), are ways of interacting with the object. they are the object’s BEHAVIOR. instance fields are the object’s STATE. when you squeeze a rubber ducky, it compresses. when you release it, it decompresses.</p>
<p>class methods, on the other hand, are to be used as utility methods, and SHOULD not operate on an object’s state necessarily. examples include Math.sqrt() or Math.sin()</p>

<p>public class Bicycle{<br>
