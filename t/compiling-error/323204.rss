    <title>Compiling error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compiling-error/323204</link>
    <description>Got Windows 7 recently and saved my server, compiler and client and shit like that on a usb stick. Now when i have downloaded JDK, i cant compile, i can only RUN the server (which is bad). I also used Lin&#39;s Environment Variable setter - which made me think that it would help, but NO..NO..NO... What do i need to do? Before i used it, i made PATH &amp; edited my Classpath... Still doesn&#39;t work, And before that - it didn&#39;t work out either.

Did i forget my brain in the bed today? ^^</description>
