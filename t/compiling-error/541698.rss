    <title>Compiling error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compiling-error/541698</link>
    <description>I tried posing this once and it didn&#39;t go through. I&#39;m going to be a lot more blunt this time and get right into the basic stuff, what I cant accomplish and what I need your help with. - SORRY if im coming off as a dick.. Not my intention.

This is the error I get when compiling;
what happened before this is I opened every file up in notepad p++ that had the server name in it, replaced all instances with NovaScape, and now this is happening.
