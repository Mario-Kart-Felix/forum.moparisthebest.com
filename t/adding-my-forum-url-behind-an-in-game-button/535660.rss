    <title>Adding my Forum URL behind an in game button</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-my-forum-url-behind-an-in-game-button/535660</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m working with deathlypvpz source/client. Not sure who to give credit to since there seems to be a conflict there. Anyway, upon first logging in the user is welcomed with a Donate, Vote, and Website button. I found the files where the URLs are located, but when I change the URLs to my own the buttons no longer work. I can supply whatever code or help might be needed to help me figure this out. Any and all help would be appreciated! Im trying my best to learn and familiarize myself with the coding but I can&#39;t seem to get this. Thanks!</description>

              <p>Depends on how you set your url (don’t post it because it can be considered advertising).<br>
Some clients make it so you need: c.getPA().sendFrame126(“<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a>”, 12000);<br>
and others: c.getPA().sendFrame126(“<a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com</a>”, 12000);<br>
and some even take: c.getPA().sendFrame126(“<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com</a>”, 12000);</p>
