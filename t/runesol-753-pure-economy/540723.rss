[b]Developers[/b]
Looking for helpers, staff, and programmers that can help configure and program new content and remake current content.

[B]RuneSol[/B]
&quot;Pure  Economy - PvP/PvM - Minimal Shops - 12 Prestiges - 120 All Skills After  6th Prestige - Classic/Revolution Combat Hybrid - Hardcore Skilling -  Hardcore Bosses - Hardcore PvP - Begin On Fastest XP/Lowest Drops, End  With Slowest XP/Best Drops&quot;

[B]What is a &quot;Pure&quot; economy?[/B]
Where  nothing is given. Creating wealth is hard. Rewards are greatest.  Endgame is the most fun. Gameplay is the most intense. The prestige is  hardcore. Rares are an actual rarity.

[B]Core Fundamental[/B]
It  is simple: Every aspect of the game will be revolutionized in some way  or another. Meaning custom content that fits the game&#39;s theme, has a  role in the game, empowers the player, and gives you an enjoyable ride.

[B]RuneSol Prestige[/B]
Prestiging  is actually a central aspect of our core fundamental. Prestiging  actually is rewarding, and not just restarting to grind more. By  prestiging, you gain both more XP and better drops, you also unlock more  abilities once you past 6th Prestige, by increasing your skills all to  120 max. This means more ways of training, more rewarding skilling,  better gear and weapons, battle more powerful foes with greater rewards.

[B]RuneSol Rares[/B]
Ending  the whole thing off, having 12th Prestige grants you to all the  benefits above at maximum, but also gives you a choice to start over  completely at no prestige, in order to obtain a rare on RuneSol. This  essential endgame, will drive the price of rares tremendously, by  actually keeping them rare, and it becomes a great anchor for all of the  economy to thrive off. And best of all, everyone has a chance to obtain  a rare, by simply playing and enjoying the game.

[B]RuneSol Unique Content[/B]
Along  with being one of the few &quot;pure&quot; economy servers out there, myself  coining the term, as it reflects it&#39;s ideals perfectly, RuneSol is also a  rediscovery of the Pure Age of RuneScape, back when there was the  highest surge of players during the wilderness and PKing days. RuneSol  tries to bring back the respect of PvP as well as the New RuneScape  where PvM has been the focus of the game.
