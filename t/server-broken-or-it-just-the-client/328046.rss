    <title>Server Broken? or it just the client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-broken-or-it-just-the-client/328046</link>
    <description>basically, im trying to get others to connect to my server, and it isn&#39;t working out to well...

i downloaded boxingscape, great 317 source with 508 models made by nixxx, and i went into GUI and changed the ip to my server&#39;s ip. honestly all i did was kinda rename the folder and such and zipped it up and uploaded to filefront. But, players for some reason still cannot connect. In the command prompt it says:

Client handler: Client Null disconnect (their IP here)

How do i fix this? i know it something i did wrong with the client, and ive looked around for 3+ hours, and just can&#39;t seem to find anything...
By the way...i can connect using the boxingscape client that came with source, but it says my ip is 127.0.0.1

msn is lukedawesome@hotmail.com   (if you really feel like helping)


thanks</description>
