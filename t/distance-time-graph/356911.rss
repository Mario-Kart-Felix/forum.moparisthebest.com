    <title>Distance-Time Graph</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/distance-time-graph/356911</link>
    <description>I need to draw a Distance-Time Graph for a Motion Project in Physics and I am having some trouble in doing so with the help of Excel.

The table of values I need to plot are as follows:
[table]
[tr]
[td]Distance (m) Time (mins)
     0                 0
     1980            2.22
     2160            2.39[/td]
[/tr]
[/table]

I need to plot each of the corresponding values as points, so, for example, (Time, Distance) and so (0,0), (2.22,1980) and (2.39,2160) are the 3 points that I need to plot. Just as additional information, the time scale is labelled on the x-axis and the distance scale is labelled on the y-axis, hence the x,y ordering, obviously.

The trouble I&#39;m experiencing is in how to setup the table in Excel so that when I highlight the table and click on the Line Graph function, the Distance Time Graph will form with all 3 coordinate points shall we say with lines joining them respectively. I know I can easily edit the names of the axes later but the axes should be in proper scale and whatnot.

My question will probably have a simple answer to it but any help would be appreciated since I am pathetically struggling at this.

EDIT: Never mind, miraculously figured it out.</description>
