              <p>I’ll give you some help:</p>
<blockquote>a club catering for teenagers is to open in your area. The club will include a wide range of activities. A membership pack is requires which will encourage teenagers to join the club. The pack must contain a three dimensional product relevant to one of the activity's.</blockquote>
<p>This one may be tricky, however it’s giving you a lot of freedom. Lots of things are relative to clubs but some are limited on 3D products. If you have CAD CAM at your school, maybe you could do a key ring. Although it’s pretty simple at first, you could incoperate some other features.</p>
<blockquote>a theater production relies heavily on good publicly to be successfull. Investigate this situation, chose a production and design the publicity material will need a display system to show it off.</blockquote>
<p>This one, is way too much work compared to other ones. I wouldn’t recommend doing this one, as there are others that are more simple, and give the exact same amount of marks.</p>
<blockquote>charity has decided to develop a container for the pupils to collect sponsorship the money. They want the container to make collecting the money more secure and more fun for the giver. they also want a promotional material to recruit pupils and inform givers</blockquote>
<p>Ideas on this one are limited. Do you have a size requirement? Maybe you could have a plastic container, which has several different slots for different types of coin. The slots are then fed to the container.</p>
<blockquote>most secondary schools have a parent handbook, which gives a variety of information to parents. They usually highlight extra curricular activities examination results and includes a map of the school among other essential information . However, these handbooks do not always focus on the needs of these students and produce a suitable handbook.</blockquote>
<p>This one is pretty simple and straightforward. It should be a breeze for you, seeing as you were new in year 7, and probably wouldn’t of minded one of these, so you should know what would be good ideas to put in it. You might need to be a touch on the creative side for this one though.</p>
<blockquote>a simple and cheep pop up coon is needed to introduce young children to ........... . The publishers wish you to submit a layout for the whole book, but only two complete two up stories. you will need to highlight the issues involved with manufacture.</blockquote>
<p>No.</p>
<blockquote>range og cosmetics for men and women is about to be launched on the market. Although the range will include items such as perfume for women and aftershave for men, the collective name, which will be. ..'...........'.. .(A logo could substitute the name.) For the initial promotion you are asked to design packages for two different packages for two different items in the range and show how to display them on the shop counter.</blockquote>
<p>This one, I love. I really like the idea of this one, and you are given a lot of room. However, I wouldn’t do this if you aren’t arty, or creative. Also, practice making some packaging. You have to be good at it to do this.</p>
<blockquote>board games for adults and children are a tradition that spans decades some are so popular that they have become household names worldwide you are required to produce a pre-production version of a new form of ................. setting the game with a theam that will appeal to people today</blockquote>
<p>I’m doing this one, as I had a great idea for a new concept of game. I wont reveal too much yet (I don’t know why though :P). The pages are pretty easy to do for this one and a lot of this could be done quickly. Don’t do this unless you have a game idea in mind. All the coursework must be in after Christmas 07, and your product must be in for testing after Easter '08. I know it seems a long time, but, unless your creative, you don’t have much time.</p>
<blockquote>computer game publisher plans to release a new game called................ packaging and publicity materials are needed for the game</blockquote>
<p>Relatively simple, but the publicity materials may be a bit of a bitch. Also, you’ll probably need to be arty for this one.</p>
<blockquote>a new shop to sell ............. is going to open in your area. Create a corporate identity for the business, stationary, bags and packaging till receipts and a model of the front of the shop.</blockquote>
<p>This one, I’d absolutely love to do. So much freedom to do whatever I want. I would have so much ideas for this I’d be shitting the ideas out. I really think you should do this one. A lot of work, time and devotion would be needed though.</p>
<blockquote>our task is to design a 3D graphic product that could stand on the reception desk of a ......................... company that would advertise the abilities of the company and would be given to the clients . is MUST be so desirable that the client will not want to throw it away</blockquote>
<p>I think this one is pretty stupid. Imo, I’d just forget about it.</p>
<p>I’d definitly go with number 9.</p>
