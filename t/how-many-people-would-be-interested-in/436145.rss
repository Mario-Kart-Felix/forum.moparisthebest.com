    <description>[b]NOTE: As of right now there is no real attempt to start or work on a server such as described here, even if it does get started after positive feedback there is a high probability that the project would be scrapped before completion due to issues concerning Developers/coders/lack of time.[/b]

The Question is, How many of you in the community would be interested in joining a completely customized server?

The goal would be to keep as much of the Authentic RSC feel as possible, while creating a new world and new look of the game. 

New Weapons
New Armor
Customized Sprites
EVERYTHING Renamed
Minigames
SOME RS2 aspects intergrated (Like Capture the flag (castlewars) treasure trails... but not much, just some minigames/distractions, no skills/godswords or crap like that)
100% Customized map/wilderness, or 100% Customized map with unchanged wilderness.
New Quests
Etc Etc

Pretty much same RSC fighting style, Same 2d action, but everything else changed. 

Feel free to post thoughts, flame, troll, whatever it is you people do as long as you vote.

I&#39;m Guessing the only people who read this section of the forums are the real RSC community people, server owners, developers, not many nubs just wanting to check out rsc. So I&#39;d like to see what you think. 

I really suck at coding, but I have a skill when it comes to making maps/items/messin&#39; with sprites. There is a 0% chance of this happening without ALOT of people liking the idea and somehow managing to find a devoted developer to do some of the changes/bugfixes. 

So don&#39;t get your hopes up.</description>

People would try it regardless, but chances of this actually coming to life are slim to none. There’s been several attempts to completely re-do RSC while keeping the basic aspect of it and it just falls through. I believe Pomp’s server was the most customized before he lost interest.<br>
