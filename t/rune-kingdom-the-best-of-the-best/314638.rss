Hello, and welcome to the official development thread of the new server Rune-Kingdom. Now for some information of the server; I will be using my previous source for coding (Delta base) and will be using a cleaned up Bluurr client with some basic edits. Right now I don&#39;t need any help but will post/edit this post when slots come available, but for now I only wish to post the current progress of the server. Thanks and enjoy. 

Teleports - 90% done; Need to find a few more cities to base the server off of currently using the following: 
[*] Burthope
[*] Burgh De Rott
[*] Canifs
[*] Port Phasmatys
[*] Isdafar
[*] Catherby
[*] Al-Kahrid

End of Cities.

Minigame - 20% Most need rewritten; some need more work done to them nevertheless they will all get a facelift. Minigames that will be included:

[*] Pest Control
[*] Barrows
[*] Duel Arena
[*] Assault
[*] Heroes Guild
[*] Godwars (Bandos, and Zamorak)
[*] Possibly more.

End of Minigames

World Map - 85% Most of the world has a bunch of NPC&#39;s to train on some having more than others all NPC&#39;s have something to drop whether it&#39;s herbs, arrows, or weapons.

End of World Map

Portals, Necklaces, Rings, Etc. 15% These will be other ways to get around the server (Though not to many of them because that will ruin it) However they will take you different locations such as minigames, donator areas, and multiple dungeons.

End of Portals, Necklaces, Rings, Etc.

Home Area 95% Mostly all needed objects are added here along with a banker and some portals also, a small minigame which requires 75+ thieving and a lockpick.

End of Home Area

Combat 60% Barley worked on as of now but did rewrite/revise some of the Ranging and some of the Melee (scared to touch the Mage at the moment).

End of Combat.

Any other things you wish me to touch up on? Post a comment I will reply..

Other Information: 
The new minigame I&#39;ve added makes you go to the Heroes Guild and talk to the door man he then gives you a key to open the door to speak with the head of the guild the head of the guild asks you to help him with the beasts whom escaped their cages in the dungeon when you get a certain amount of kills you can then trade them in for items such as the Slayer Helmet, Helm of Neiznot, and a random 3rd age piece.
