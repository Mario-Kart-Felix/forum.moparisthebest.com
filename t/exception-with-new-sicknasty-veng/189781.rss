    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/exception-with-new-sicknasty-veng/189781</link>
    <description>Many people have had this problem and maybe one of you guys can answer it once and for all =). this is a quote from someone who had the same problem that explains what happens

&lt;blockquote&gt;i did tut right added everthing in right spots, ingame when i cast it it messeges me saying &quot;you activate vengence&quot; i get the graffic then screen sits frozin for a few secs, -connection lost- kicks me off to log in screen, i check the server and it says 
[code]
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException
        at client.process(client.java:14850)
        at PlayerHandler.process(PlayerHandler.java:137)
        at server.main(server.java:47)[/code]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

later on  &quot;For ( ; ; )&quot; said &lt;blockquote&gt;You&#39;re getting the null pointers because of the AttackingOn&#39;s.

Also I still don&#39;t get why it&#39;s named &#39;sicknasty vengeance&#39; ... sounds like a bad porno.&lt;/blockquote&gt; (lol)
