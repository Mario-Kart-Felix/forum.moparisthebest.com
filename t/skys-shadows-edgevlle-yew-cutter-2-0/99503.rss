    <title>Skys Shadow&#39;s Edgevlle Yew Cutter 2.0</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/skys-shadows-edgevlle-yew-cutter-2-0/99503</link>
    <description>After awhile away from SCAR scripting, I have redone a lot of my Edgeville Yew Cutter. However, I have a limited amount of time and would like it if some people could help me test it. Some current bugs that I am trying to fix are walking outside of the yew building, and missing the tree when trying to click. If you could post any other errors and if you somehow get a progress report then post that also.  Thanks in advance to anyone who helps.  Script is attached.</description>

<p>For the tree-clicking bit, try making sure the mouse is steadily on the tree before clicking.</p>
