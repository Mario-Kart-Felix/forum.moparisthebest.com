    <title>Patriots: Throw the game?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/patriots-throw-the-game/178530</link>
    <description>  I&#39;m not here to say they did, but it sure as hell looks like it. I&#39;m happy that the Giants won(made a nice win on those bets), but something isn&#39;t right. I noticed Patriots QB awfully happy throughout the entire game, always having this little smile on his face. Missing unbelievable passes, and just plain doing horrible last night. The Giants where doing OK until the final quarter when they made one of the luckiest passes I&#39;ve seen since 99&#39; with Faulk from the rams was in his prime. But look at it, even though they cheated most of their games, I know the Patriots are better than this. 

What do you think? Did they throw the game? Or is it they just decided to suck on the only day it mattered.</description>

              <p>are you a patriots fanboy?</p>
<p>i doubt it. i think that once tom brady is under pressure and being sacked, and knocked down frequently, it disrupts him. all game he was knocked down and sacked 6 times (last 2 plays).</p>
<p>notice all the games that patriots ALMOST lost. eagles, ravens, ect. Each team had pressure on the QB.<br>
The Giants had enough luck to make the plays when it counted, have some luck, and win.</p>
<p>tl;dr tom brady sucks under pressure, giants win</p>
