    <title>Senior Member Title</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/senior-member-title/546629</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been on this website since August 06, 2006. Just wondering if there is a type of tag besides &quot;member&quot; that is available for us long term users.

Appreciate any response.</description>

<p>The people who matter have reputations that precede them, and these reputations are entirely removed from notions such as post counts, website usage, or account age.

People that have a reputation have it for a reason, and being able to see how many posts someone has made doesn’t effect that <span class="bbcode-b">at all</span>. There are plenty of people people here with a reputation that didn’t (or barely did) have the Moparian title. peterbjornx, discardedx2, etc, all came with contributions and within their first 20 posts had their reputation. It’s apples and oranges you are comparing. Post count was never an indicator of reputation.</p>
<p>EDIT - Also, wasn’t it you that made the initial push to hide the Vet rank? My memory may not be serving me well, but if it’s true, doesn’t that also contract what you are saying here? You say these simple post based titles take away the esteem and reputation from people that deserve it, but the very definition of of that rank was making said people visible who had earned the title.</p>

              <p>I think it’s a good idea to remove most ranks, but i think people who have done work that you can actually call work instead of making just another 317 (sorry but those just iritate me personally and my statement shouldn’t be taken as a official argument)<br>
I mean, nearly everyone knows Davidi2 here.<br>
But i was thinking…<br>
Someone who posted alot in the model section and has some adored model work, could get the rank "modeler"<br>
Someone who posted alot of adored servers (with creative and new work) could be ranked "Coder"<br>
And variants for people who have been actively doing it for 5+ years like "Veteran Coder"<br>
Or fun ranks for coders that work on a specific revision, like “317 junkie” that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I get that some level of profesionality is needed, but ranks make the forums more personal.<br>
And a bit of compitition is healthy.</p>
<p>Anyway, those are my ideas.</p>
<p>Kind regards.<br>
