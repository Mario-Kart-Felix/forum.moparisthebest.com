    <title>Portforwarding Weird problem?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-weird-problem/395795</link>
    <description>Alright so I portforwarded a long time ago and now it just stopped working. I think it maybe &#39;cause we got the Vonage phone service.. not sure. My modem connects to the Vonage box thing then the Vonage thing connects to my router. So I think it&#39;s the reason my portforwarding isn&#39;t working. I&#39;ve read all tut&#39;s on portforwarding and none of them worked. I even tried that 317 auto-portforwarder, and that didn&#39;t work either. Can someone help me, please? :(
