    <title>[REQ] Need Help Adding Combat into a blank 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-need-help-adding-combat-into-a-blank-317/347306</link>
    <description>Hey all,

I am building a new server from scratch off a base called Primileon. It is a 317 that looks like a 508.

It is a Winterlove framework and I was basically wondering how I would go about adding proper combat. I have basic attacking players, but no attacking npcs or range or magic.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, or if you could just point me in the right direction.

Thanks a bunch.</description>
