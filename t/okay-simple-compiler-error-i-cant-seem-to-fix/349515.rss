              <p>You need to change the path inside the batch file to match your version of JDK.</p>
<p><code>@echo off
if exist "%programfiles%\Java" (call :compile "%programfiles%\Java\") else (goto error)
:compile
for /D %%x in ("%~1jdk*") do (set p="%%~x\bin\javac.exe")
if defined p (%p% -cp . *.java)
if defined p (goto end)
:error
echo You do not have Java installed. Please download it at the site that is about to load.
"%programfiles%\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
:end
echo Finished!
pause
exit</code></p>
<p>This batch file will automatically check for any version of JDK and use it to compile. If this batch file still throws an error, you need to download JDK, in which you should search the Tutorial and Download sections for further help.</p>
