    <description>[code]/**
 * RS2E DOS Proof Of Concept by c|p 
 * 
 * RS2E features many poor coding practices and inefficiencies, due to inbreds creating it.
 * Several networked functions (such as sending map data, sending player updates, checking for banned usernames)
 * do not cache data loaded from a file, and instead read the entire file on each call to the method.
 * 
 * Unfortunately, most of these happen in conjunction with each other, intensifying the effects.
 * 
 * In the case of checking for banned usernames, a larger list of banned usernames in the file the server checks
 * will greatly scale the attack due to having to search each line, that is, if the username(s) used to propogate
 * excessive reading are not in the file or are at the very bottom. Due to the nature of BufferedReader, it may 
 * also bring the server to a halt causing the VM to run out of memory.
 * 
 * Sending map data is almost identical, except in order to be effective it needs several fake clients &quot;walking&quot; back
 * and forth between areas in order to force the server to read the map data files in excess.
 * 
 * Lastly, sending player update packets will also cause an excess amount of reading regardless if the server is
 * experiencing an attack or not.  The code that writes this packet contains many calls &lt;b&gt;per iteration&lt;/b&gt; of
 * the packet construction.  Even if the server simply has a large number of legitimate users, it will swallow
 * server resources.
 * 
 * Upon further review I have noticed that the player update packet constructor also retains the same DOS found
 * in winterlove&#39;s original code: if there are a certain number of players in one area the main thread will exit
 * due to an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception being thrown because of the limited size of the &quot;stream&quot; used to store
 * update data temporarily.
 * 
 * In short, the simplest attack that can be performed is sending several hundred login packets, in order to increase
 * load drastically each server tick.  If enough packets are excepted the server will cease to function due to the
 * main thread exiting.
 * 
 * A more complex attack would involve using the previous method listed, in combination with sending walk packets to
 * have the &quot;clients&quot; force reading of map data over and over again.
 * 
 * Proof of Concept code has been omitted to avoid abuse.

Even if it has a major flaw, you have to give him props for writing his own source. I imagine I’m going to receive flame for this, but lol. I can’t write my own source, and I KNOW for a fact that none of these moparscapers can. (Excluding a select few. (anthony) can, and a lot of the mods could, Yzracer could, the mopar vets could. Like I said, a select few. You guys know who you are, so don’t flame me for it.) Props to pali.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Then give props to the people who make better ‘sources’. However, Pali did release a server using NIO. He does deserve credit for what he did, but that doesn’t mean its a good thing.[/quote]His server that “used” NIO is not even a real non-blocking server. It uses the new IO packages but it is far from asynchronous, as it doesn’t even make use of a selector. It’s a joke, and he doesn’t deserve anything but to be laughed at for that piece of junk.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he can be given props for actually doing something more than just bickering about how lame other peoples servers are.</p>

Pretty much every server is vulnerable.[/quote]Yes but if it’s publically released nobody will be able to productively run their own unprotected private server, forcing them to take action.</p>

Pali, there are many things wrong with the server besides what he mentioned. A good example is that you should never write the same code twice. In your server, you have to write combat for PvP and PvN and NvN. Players and Npcs share many things, so they should implement or extend one class, maybe an Entity. Also, you pack too many things together. Each class should be highly specialized, don’t be afraid to have lots of classes.</p>
<p>Check out the JavaDoc of my server at <a href="http://www.worldscapeblitz.com/java/blitz/508javadoc/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.worldscapeblitz.com/java/blitz/508javadoc/</a>, it has over 100 classes. And still there is lots I need to improve. Currently all the packet reading is crammed into one class, the reason being is that I’m going to implement the one class per packet system into my Blitz networking API directly, so I don’t have to recreate it for each server that uses Blitz IO.</p>
<p>Your server would be good a proof of concept, like WinterLoves. What would be great is if you released the protocols instead of actual servers, and let people make their own. This would be great for 523, as no server is released for it, you get some/all ‘credit’ for the basic protocol, you can’t be blamed for server problems, and no one takes credit for your work. You would also need to release some interface IDs and such though. I think there should be a central place, such as a Wiki, like RSCD has, to document the protocol and other things such as the interface IDs.</p>
<p>[quote=“Yz85Racer, post:1, topic:252192”]ENDING QUOTE TRAIN -<br>
Why manually load packets? Why manually have to type it for it too take affect, why not have them pluginable. How does your reply to number 3 go to number 2? They’re two totally different things, by threading I mean, how you handle your players, how you spawn new threads for NIO.</p>
<p>Your answer to number 5 and 6 is fucking idiotic, why not use a database, or something that doesn’t suck.[/quote]<br>
Yea, NIO isn’t really useful without a Selector. I use a database for all my data, nothing is loaded from files.</p>

<p>I think it’s more likely your crashing the network than the server. The main thread wont exit until it runs out of memory, which is almost never if you’ve set a high memory size. The problem is jvm only adjusts the memory size every minute or so at the same time it does a garbage collect, so if your memory usage spikes in that time, the server crashes. If you have a large pipeline and a lot of memory, it shouldn’t crash… although the latency might go up because of the flood of packets.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No you idiot, its exploiting bugs in the server code. If the buffer overflows from too many players in an area, and the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException goes uncaught, the main thread will ‘crash’. And if the application needs more memory then is free, Java performs a garbage collection, and if there is still no enough memory it will throw a java.lang.OutOfMemoryException.</p>
