    <title>SRC (renamed client) not loading</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/src-renamed-client-not-loading/157219</link>
    <description>Okay, I downloaded the SRC (?Silabs? renamed client), to aid in figuring out a method of loading a mapback. The only problem, is that it stops loading, no errors in the cmd, on &#39;requesting config&#39;. I traced the error, and it is the &#39;unknown error&#39; when abyte0 is returned as null. The error says &#39;connection error - retrying in X&#39;. I&#39;m fairly sure this is an error in the deob, obviously abyte0 is being returned as null, but I have yet to find the location of this. If you could help me, or know how to fix, please post. It would be appreciated.

Thanks</description>
