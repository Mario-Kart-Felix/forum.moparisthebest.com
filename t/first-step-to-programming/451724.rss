    <description>Hello Guys,

Some of you may have seen my previous topic inquiring about how I can start programming, I didn&#39;t expect this much advice but it&#39;s great. A lot of people suggested I download a source/client which I&#39;ve actually done. I&#39;ve downloaded the &quot;TrisidiaX&quot; package just to play out and test out a few things. I&#39;ve got JDK my version is : 7dk-u5-windows-x64. For some reason when I try to run the source and client a message appears saying &quot;Windows cannot find Java&quot;. How can I sort this out? If you know please post a comment below.

I&#39;d also like to let you know this is my 1st time doing any of this, so sorry for the stupid questions. I also have team-viewer so If someone could help get up and running, it&#39;ll be much appreciated.</description>

              <p>I would, just to be safe. Weather that’s the problem though I’m not sure. It’s always good to have the most up to date version of Java though, especially if you’re downloading source’s and client’s which have been edited in more recent versions.</p>

<p>ok, this could be for a number of reasons, if it says cannot find path specified then you need to edit your run.bat by simply right clicking it and selecting edit. Look for some code that has a underscore in it like this 1.7.0_02 or something and change it to this: <code>1.7.0_05</code> and if that doesn’t work then update your Java all together, because it may be your java.exe which is hard to locate.</p>

<p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>I did what you told me to do with the source and it ran, but when It came to the client it said “Windows cannot find Java” make sure you typed the name correctly then try again". So would I need to update my current Java then?</p>
