    <description>Hello mopar!

Okey, first of all, I cannot code a shit of java. Im just trying to do simple godsword pk server, I mean really simple at start. I have designed easy Edge pk, whit few shops, Food shop and of course the godsword shop. I have clean deltaclient and the source.
   So, I need godswords. http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,438667.0.html
I downloaded that, I know where to add models (to the models at client right?), but where I but the codes?! To the class8.java? Really I dont know anything, if I need to but them to class8.java, but where at class8.java?
Hopefully someone can help me.

-Whated

P.S I will (maybe) ask something more in the future...

My compiler doesnt work, when Im trying to compile all it says:
The system cannot find the path specified.
Press any key to continue...

I have done all what the tutorials have sayed; Ive done CLASSPATH and PATH, editted 19 to 20...PLEASE HELP!</description>
