[u][b]Introduction[/b][/u]

Hey guys, 
I&#39;m here to show a new rsps called &quot;Empire 06&quot;.
Empire 06 is going to be a stable ECO/PK server with allot of skills. 
By now most of you are probably thinking - 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Another 06 Remake that is going to fail...&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We are just an RSPS with 06 Gameframe.
