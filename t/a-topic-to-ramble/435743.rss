    <title>A topic to ramble</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-topic-to-ramble/435743</link>
    <description>I just thought of this concept, so I&#39;d like to share it. Having a topic to ramble philosophy in is a lot of fun. :)

Anyway. Take this concept: given the amount of people on the earth, at every moment of time (no matter how low the order of magnitude), there is always a single person awake and conscious at any given moment of time. It&#39;s almost presumable this case has been ongoing since the advent of humans and human derivatives (such as species prior to homosapien). Does mankinds cumulative consciousness somehow represent our constant struggle against death, and our continual persistence to live?

Perhaps that&#39;s unclear. Here&#39;s for a terrible analogy: imagine a captain of a small wooden boat, battling it up against a maelstrom or a hurricane or something. He&#39;s constantly working the lines, holding the ship steady, throwing anchor if need be, anything to save his own life and his ship. If he lets his grip go for one second, it may be all over for him. I consider this like mankind. Our continual consciousness adds to our overall &quot;battle&quot; against inevitable destruction. It&#39;s almost as though our cumulative consciousness somehow blinds use and provides ignorance for the ultimate reality of death and the ending of our own lives, and thereby the lives of our species.

If this remains unclear, that&#39;s fine. :P Maybe I&#39;ll post more ramblings I come up with. Post any replies or corollaries as you see fit. :)</description>

<p>we aren’t the only species that has at least one awake at every moment. your theory would apply to a variety of animals, thus saying that every animal is as destructive as us?</p>

The total effect of the culture industry is one of anti-enlightenment, in which, as Horkheimer and I have noted, enlightenment, that is the progressive technical domination of nature, becomes mass deception and is turned into a means for fettering consciousness.

I think a better explanation to why someone is always awake is the way the earth is positioned in the universe.  The sun is always facing one section of the planet, and it’s hard to sleep with the sun in your eyes.</p>

<p>Not in the slightest. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> This topic was merely a proposition; an occurring thought. I really assumed the reader would lead to the conclusion that, if one can realize that mankind as a whole is always conscious, what would happen in a scenario of unconsciousness. Ie, what would happen in the world when all humans are unconscious? Does life really go on?</p>
<p>I believe there was a show that failed on NBC a few years back that played on this theory. I can’t recall the name, but I recall everyone in the world blacking out for an exact amount of time, and seeing something in the future. Pretty cool idea, and partially related.</p>
<p>Also, this idea plays well into superconsciousness and zen buddhism. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I just thought of this concept, so I’d like to share it. Having a topic to ramble philosophy in is a lot of fun. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Anyway. Take this concept: given the amount of people on the earth, at every moment of time (no matter how low the order of magnitude), there is always a single person awake and conscious at any given moment of time. It’s almost presumable this case has been ongoing since the advent of humans and human derivatives (such as species prior to homosapien). Does mankinds cumulative consciousness somehow represent our constant struggle against death, and our continual persistence to live?</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s unclear. Here’s for a terrible analogy: imagine a captain of a small wooden boat, battling it up against a maelstrom or a hurricane or something. He’s constantly working the lines, holding the ship steady, throwing anchor if need be, anything to save his own life and his ship. If he lets his grip go for one second, it may be all over for him. I consider this like mankind. Our continual consciousness adds to our overall “battle” against inevitable destruction. It’s almost as though our cumulative consciousness somehow blinds use and provides ignorance for the ultimate reality of death and the ending of our own lives, and thereby the lives of our species.</p>
<p>If this remains unclear, that’s fine. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Maybe I’ll post more ramblings I come up with.
