    <title>Need help with NULLED items on my CLIENT. Thanks</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-nulled-items-on-my-client-thanks/249132</link>
    <description>Alrighty, i&#39;m making a CLIENT for my server that i&#39;m coding. I was wondering if there was a way I could somehow fix the NULLED items on my CLIENT, Such as; The skillcapes, godwars items, and others are all nulled, and therefor stated as; useless. Can anyone tell me how I can fix this problem? 

Help GREATLY appreciated.</description>
