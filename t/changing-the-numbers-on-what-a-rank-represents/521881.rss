    <title>Changing the numbers on what a rank represents</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-numbers-on-what-a-rank-represents/521881</link>
    <description>Alright so basically I have decided to use a pi source and basically when I first opened it I realized that the donator rank was not coded in, so I added it in and then I noticed that I couldn&#39;t put it down as 1 because rank 1 was moderator and I would have to put it to 4, which would allow a donator to do all ranks that a owner could do, so basically my question is how could I change players rights 1 to equal donator instead of moderator and so on.</description>
