    <title>Internet not working/slow</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/internet-not-working-slow/542743</link>
    <description>So I just moved back from college and I went to use my desktop but the internet is either not working (even though connected to the network) or insanely slow. However, my macbook pro is working as normal and everything is loading very quickly.

I&#39;ve spent a few hours today googling solutions but nothing has worked. Anyone have any ideas on how I can try to fix this before I go ahead and restore it to factory settings?

Desktop uses windows 8</description>

              <p>I do agree it could be the adapter very likely. I have owned a couple of different Netgear adapters and they seem to have a variety of quality connections vs. crappy connections on the  occasional day.</p>
<p>There are several factors here you should consider though also</p>
<p>-Many routers have a “power saver” mode. Make sure you are using the full power<br>
-If the router has this “power saver” mode then make sure you also have the router/cable modem ( some are combined that’s why I say this ) make sure they are standing up properly. I have had to replace more than one motorola dual consoles from not realizing they overheat after 100% use so often.<br>
-Does the internet seem to go out every 2 hours? 5 hours? 10 hours? what? ( It’s true some ISP companies will reset the connection which I assume is refreshing to a new  ip ( hence dynamic )  but it still disconnects you. I found that one of my Netgear adapters would disconnect constantly cause it was going bad.<br>
-Have you ever noticed your usb adapter gets extremely hot? I know a couple of adapters that have done this as well ( both name brand and off brand )</p>

Unless they were talking [url=http://i.imgur.com/q53aaQM.png]this speed[/url], that's total bs.
<p>Also, seems you need to make sure you’ve got the drivers for Realtek RTL8191SU since that’s what is in the usb.</p>

<p>But onto the topic at hand, it could be a driver problem as already mentioned. You may also want to check out your router to make sure the ip doesn’t have a cap on it, I’ve had a problem before were my router decided to cap traffic on my computer for no apparent reason. If this router is old and out dated, why not also upgrade and get a nice new shiny AC router which will be out dated this coming fall!</p>

<p>Well I didn’t make any changes so I don’t think it would be that.</p>
<p>I just renewed my kaspersky license so maybe it could be something with its firewall blocking the internet. I don’t think so because i’ve always had it so i’m not sure. I’ve looked through its settings and can’t find anything different.</p>

Have you tried disabling the security? If it’s causing the problem then I’m sure that there’s a setting to fix your issue?[/quote]<br>

I’ve diagnosed your problem and have come to a conclusion.</p>
<p>It appears you’ve decided to install an operating system known as “Windows 8”. This OS is considered an epidemic and is fudgeing horrible across the board.<br>
[/quote]<br>
As an ex nurse in the Army, I have diagnosed your problem as mentally retarded. Unfortunantly there is no cure however you can do us all a favor by not posting stupid things :)[/quote]<br>
I like the irony in calling me retarded in one sentence, then in the very next sentence spelling unfortunately wrong. And since I just have SO MUCH respect for “the Army”, I’ll take your diagnosis seriously regarding to my “problem as mentally retarded.”</p>
