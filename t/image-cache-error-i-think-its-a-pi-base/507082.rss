    <title>Image Cache Error. (I think its a PI base)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/image-cache-error-i-think-its-a-pi-base/507082</link>
    <description>I have no clue what to do. I am just trying to JAR a client for the server I am hosting. Once I compress the cache, I open it and make sure my background screen is in. After that, I place it in dropbox and then download the cache, BUT once I do my created image is gone and the old one reappears. 

Please don&#39;t post &quot;change it in the cache file&quot; Tried it.

I just want to know if it is stored somewhere to automatically place that specific background image on the client and override mine.

Also, I did change the dropbox download link in the files and it downloads it correctly, buy it just replaces everything of mine with the originals.</description>
