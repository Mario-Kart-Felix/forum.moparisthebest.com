As you can see, these Jews are [b]absolutely confident[/b] that the land belongs to them.
Similarly, many Muslims are also [b]absolutely confident[/b] that the land is theirs.

I bet that none of those people ever ask themselves a question that every objective observer must always ask. [i]What if I&#39;m wrong?[/i]
How do I know what I think I know except that it&#39;s what I was brought up to believe and have never known anything different.


If both sides were not religious, they would be able to sit down and talk about the situation rationally, before you know it the two sides would intermarry and would become one.
Religion here serves to divide people, it drives a wedge between them and motivates a conflict who&#39;s shock waves reach everybody in the world today.</description>

<p>But looking at that video, what distinguishes their ideas from the ideas of the Nazi’s? They both think they belong to the ‘superior’ race and they want to ‘clean’ their land.

              <p>You’re right that nationalisms inspire great hatred too, but these are often driven by a desire for land. After all, the Americas and Australia are lush continents with a large amount of natural resources. The two world wars started in Europe due to nationalism and hatred of jewish people.</p>
<p>Isn’t nationalism based on faith too? If you are a nationalist you have <span class="bbcode-i">absolute certainty</span> that you’re country is the best and that other countries are run by little girls. You only get to be part of your country because you happened to be born there.</p>
<p>But now, all those conflicts have settled down. The native americans and europeans have divided up their land, and they settle disputes in the courtroom or through a democratic process.<br>
If you’re talking about the wars in the 16th and 17th century between many nations, you may be interested to know they are called the European Wars of Religion. These wars went on for two centuries and inspired philosophers to come up with ideas like freedom of speech, democracy. Sitting down, talking about your problems and reaching a compromise so that such wars wouldn’t happen again.</p>
<p>What does the Holy Land have? Deserts and mountain ranges. Most Israelis live in a tiny strip of land on the shore. There are little natural resources there, no oil, no diamonds, little fertile land. They have water shortages in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem for goodness sake.</p>
<p>Lothy how do you explain that european jews are white and have blonde/brown hair while arab jews are darker skinned and have black hair.<br>
Although jews try to discourage marrying out, they still interbred with the local population of whatever they happened to go.<br>
They’re a race of their own because they try not to interbreed with outsiders very much but it still happens enough that jews are not genetically different from anyone else.<br>
If there was no christianity to start with, jews wouldn’t have been persecuted for twenty centuries for killing christ.</p>

<p>Also, I tend to see jews as a people more than a group that worships. As if they’re a race of their own, so to speak. Even if religion didn’t come in to it in today’s age, jews would still be jews and would likely still suffer some sort of persecution because of it.</p>

<p>As you can see, these Jews are <span class="bbcode-b">absolutely confident</span> that the land belongs to them.<br>
Similarly, many Muslims are also <span class="bbcode-b">absolutely confident</span> that the land is theirs.</p>
<p>I bet that none of those people ever ask themselves a question that every objective observer must always ask. <span class="bbcode-i">What if I’m wrong?</span><br>
How do I know what I think I know except that it’s what I was brought up to believe and have never known anything different.</p>
<p>If both sides were not religious, they would be able to sit down and talk about the situation rationally, before you know it the two sides would intermarry and would become one.<br>
Religion here serves to divide people, it drives a wedge between them and motivates a conflict who’s shock waves reach everybody in the world today.</p>
