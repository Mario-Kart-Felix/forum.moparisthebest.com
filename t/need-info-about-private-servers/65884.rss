    <description>Hey all. Im just wondering hows it going for the private RS2 Servers



Does _ALL_ Quest work properly?
Does _ALL_ Skills and skill training work with the same xp rate as on RS?
Is there _ALL_ Npc&#39;s (Working to talk with)?
Does all merchants WORK?
Does the PKING WORK?

Im very exited on private sevrers. Id love some pure private pking with my friends and so but ill wait till the servers are 95% Runescape Like
with all functions and all

Thanks for the answer</description>

              <p>Hello,  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Quests do not work properly, only “Cooks Assistant” quest works, but there is tutorials how to make your own quests. ( And the cooks assistant quest is lame and un-needed)<br>
I’m not sure if ALL skills work, but the xp rate is highly different from RS, for exampe if you hit a door you get like 10k xp. Private servers are made because people want to have a good time, having same xp as in RS is crap. That would be like, you play real RS in a world with 1 player.<br>
Not all Npc’s of RS are in private servers, lags too much but you can add any npc you want by yourself.<br>
What you mean by merchants? You mean shops? If you do then, there is like the general store is the only one that is in the exact spot as in RS, but other shops in private servers have been made by people ( you can make shops also ).<br>
Pking works. There is Pk-servers which have whole RS a pk-zone or Non-Pk servers which have no pking at all, and you can make pk/safe-zones yourself also. Don’t know if that helps. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Specials don’t work on private servers. Private servers are just a lame replica of Runescape, and Runescape is a lame replica of life, imo. LMAO</p>
