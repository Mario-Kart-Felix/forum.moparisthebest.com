    <title>NPC/Player appear on different coordinates than they actually are</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-player-appear-on-different-coordinates-than-they-actually-are/265392</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been working on my Pvp/PvN combat recently, and I&#39;ve noticed that the NPC and/or player are actually on a different square/coordinate than they appear to be.

I can see this because when you follow the player/NPC, or they follow you, they attack you from a different spot, but when you log out and then back in, you or the player/NPC shows in the actual spot.
I don&#39;t think It&#39;s anything to do with updating the player/player&#39;s appearance, because I have tried that and it has no effect on it :/.

I&#39;ll try and make a video if I can get the glitch to happen again, which is most likely because it happens quite often when attacking a player/NPC.

Any ideas anyone?

Thanks in advance.</description>
