</aside>
<p>When did I say you were a poor coder? I asked if you could post something that you have learned from a tutorial. I know I’m not the greatest coder in the history of the world, no shit. I learned from reading code, I didn’t C+P a tut, rename a server, and then post a development thread about (4 times this has been posted btw). If I did Copy and Paste a tut and I planned on releasing that source I would put an <span class="mention">@author</span> tag so credits would be given.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I didn’t just copy and paste, i also read the codes, and I haven’t been making the threads, I’m not on Moparscape that much but since this thread started, I have been. But almost every comment from anyone has been negative about how “this will not go far”… Well, once again, i’m sorry i’m not the best at coding, no one is, because it just keeps getting more, and more advanced. But at least don’t post negative comments, of course it won’t go far if everyone is dis’in it because then people who view this will think it’s shit as well.[/quote]<br>
yeah ur not the best but ur still the one who coded this even if u used tut who cares</p>

<p>Yeah well maybe you should create something on your own. You must’ve learned something from the tutorials you have added. Why not try to make something yourself now?

<p>Yeah well maybe you should create something on your own. You must’ve learned something from the tutorials you have added. Why not try to make something yourself now? Maybe people saying “Don’t see this going far because all I see is tuts” is a hint for you to get creative and do something that isn’t in a tutorial.</p>

<p>I have, I made an acheivement system where you get points when you click it, not like the one from <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a>. I made Dungeoneering with 3 dungeons, planning on making more, just need to find maps that are long/confusing to get through. Those are the big ones for now. Also little things like Air PvP, took like 5 minutes to make it though :p.</p>
