    <description>[b]RsBot (Should Stop)
[/b]

&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s been a while since we updated you on what we are doing to prevent cheating in RuneScape, and particularly to catch and ban macroers, so here’s what’s currently going on:

You’ve probably already noticed while playing the game that there has been a lot less macroing going on over the last year, as we’ve been getting more effective at preventing it. Gone are the days where every tree has an accompanying crowd of bots. However, we’re not resting on our laurels, and in fact we have just strengthened our macro-detection systems yet again. We are about to ban several thousand more accounts for macroing. We have reviewed all the macro programs available, and there are none we cannot detect.

These days we are taking a zero-tolerance approach to macroing. Players caught for macroing don’t receive a warning, or a chance to appeal, or even a last-chance appeal - they are just permanently banned. Don’t make the mistake of believing that we’ll be soft, and that you can get away with it until you are warned. You can’t. Don’t risk your account. By the time you realize you’ve been caught it will be far too late.

Also, high-level and members’ accounts are NOT immune, or given an extra chance. One of the reasons for our RWT changes was precisely so players couldn’t effectively macro on low–level, throwaway accounts to gain wealth. This means they were tempted to macro on their high–level, main accounts instead, which plays straight into our hands as our existing anti-macro systems catch and ban them! This has proven very effective; so far this month we have already banned over 500 high-level accounts with skills in the 80s and 90s. Don’t make your account one of them.

This is a warning to players that would have otherwise been sucked in by the misinformation spread by cheating communities; don’t do it, or you will lose your hard-earned account.

For further information, please refer to the honour section of the Rules of RuneScape.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

there looking out for people botting so becareful.

Make sure you read it all because it says you will be Ip&#39;d.</description>

<p>Nah, it’s cuz rsBot uses methods to inject data/code into the applet to perform an action while rsca uses java’s useful reflection to read off data without any tampering of the orriginal code SO Fagex can just easily add in a simple method that if any code was tampered off the client, then it would be flagged to be checked on.</p>

<p>All current bot detections schemes employed by Jagex are under assumption. Frankly, we have no idea how they are detecting the new bots. Some people theorize that it could be the loading of the client, but that only covers <em>most</em> bots, not all. For all we know, they could have improved their human-detection systems serverside. That type of an improvement would certainly cover all bots. And, since Jagex has 100k+ simultaneous players, they have infinite more resources of player research than we do, giving us the lower hand by a long shot.</p>

I saw this. However, cheating is even easier now. Jagex is beyond stupid to have changed the randoms, as that was the main problem for bots. Now, I can go a day of playing without even encountering. RSBot is pretty much undetectable, and Jagex has no real way of finding out. This is bullshit and it won’t change.<br>

Deserve to be banned if you use it anyway, faggots.<br>

<p>u always make me laugh rich :)[/quote]<br>
Its not our fault Jagex continue to say theres no cheats at all, its not our fault they won’t let us bot.</p>
<p>What they are doing is banning everyone from botting and yet we continue and yet they lose players.<br>
But I can say nearlly half of Runescape uses bots. They can continue to ban but they will lose an<br>
enourmouse amount of players.</p>
<p>Whats wrong with botting? They still get Players, they just wont be working? Its random, they ban<br>
people for playing there game…</p>

<p>Jagex should not have remove “proper” PKing, a lot of botting would be prevented. In my case I never cheated before PKing was removed but now bot more than actual play.</p>

<p>No they don’t. Most people make use of dynamic IP addresses, and even those with static IP addresses can change their address.<br>
They’d never risk banning an IP range or even a single IP as there’s the chance that it’ll block an innocent user at some stage. The reality is that they only have the power to ban individual accounts if they want to guarantee that no collateral damage takes place.</p>
