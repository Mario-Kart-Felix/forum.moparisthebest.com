    <title>How to i embedd the code into my site!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-i-embedd-the-code-into-my-site/346678</link>
    <description>I want to put either my WEBCLIENT (from rs-ps or moparscape client) or my CLIENT and embed it into my website.  I know RS3SERVER HAS done it to the moparscape one.

Can you tell me in detail how i am to do this..

NB: i have a website setup and running with a content management system etc.. just want to embed it into the &quot;play now&quot; page.

Thanks.</description>
