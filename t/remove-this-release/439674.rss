    <title>&quot;Remove this release&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/remove-this-release/439674</link>
    <description>I&#39;m getting sick of seeing this (not that common on here, but it is on other sites), everyone wants them to remove any halfway decent releases.  Their best argument is that people will leech it, witch they will, and post it on the status page.

Although this is true, you have to face some facts.

1.  Some projects are open-source meaning everyone has access to the source code, this is to help make the quality of servers in general better.  It&#39;s much better to see servers that have some decent and fairly working content over the servers we have now.  90% of servers today are actually like allot of the gaming whores on Youtube, they just shit out half-assed content to soak up cash off it.  I know better quality servers won&#39;t help this issue, but there&#39;s nothing you can do.  I at least want to logg into a small community that has some decent working code over the shit on the toplists now.

2.  If one server&#39;s code is better than some of your server&#39;s code, don&#39;t ask for it to be removed.  Why?  Because the source code is right fucking there, you can take it if it&#39;s really that necessary.  You have one thing the leechers won&#39;t, a player base, meaning people will probably stick with yours anyway.

3.  If you don&#39;t want your code being leaked or released, don&#39;t give it out to everyone.  Plain and simple.  If you value your code that much, don&#39;t give it to people you don&#39;t even know (People on MSN or Skype don&#39;t count, I&#39;m talking real-life friends).  You know it&#39;s probably going to happen, with people being so unpredictable.  So why not save the moderators the hassle and not put it in someone Else&#39;s server anyway?

4.  Everyone deserves to have their own server.  If everyone kept all their code to themselves, servers would be non-existent.  Mopar&#39;s status page actually makes money off the sponsored servers list (no shit), and if he didn&#39;t, I seriously doubt he would be hosting it.  If we didn&#39;t have such a large abundance of servers, the status page wouldn&#39;t be there, meaning no advertising. In fact, most people get into RSPS because they are directed to a leech and then find this site.

The  ones who  don’t go to  general discussion are the leech0rz and such so they want it released anyway. This is a topic about  those who  say they   wish the  owner would remove it.</p>

              <p>I’m getting sick of seeing this (not that common on here, but it is on other sites), everyone wants them to remove any halfway decent releases.  Their best argument is that people will leech it, witch they will, and post it on the status page.</p>
<p>Although this is true, you have to face some facts.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some projects are open-source meaning everyone has access to the source code, this is to help make the quality of servers in general better.  It’s much better to see servers that have some decent and fairly working content over the servers we have now.  90% of servers today are actually like allot of the gaming whores on Youtube, they just shit out half-assed content to soak up cash off it.  I know better quality servers won’t help this issue, but there’s nothing you can do.  I at least want to logg into a small community that has some decent working code over the shit on the toplists now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one server’s code is better than some of your server’s code, don’t ask for it to be removed.  Why?  Because the source code is right fucking there, you can take it if it’s really that necessary.  You have one thing the leechers won’t, a player base, meaning people will probably stick with yours anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don’t want your code being leaked or released, don’t give it out to everyone.  Plain and simple.  If you value your code that much, don’t give it to people you don’t even know (People on MSN or Skype don’t count, I’m talking real-life friends).  You know it’s probably going to happen, with people being so unpredictable.  So why not save the moderators the hassle and not put it in someone Else’s server anyway?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone deserves to have their own server.  If everyone kept all their code to themselves, servers would be non-existent.  Mopar’s status page actually makes money off the sponsored servers list (no shit), and if he didn’t, I seriously doubt he would be hosting it.  If we didn’t have such a large abundance of servers, the status page wouldn’t be there, meaning no advertising. In fact, most people get into RSPS because they are directed to a leech and then find this site.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>/rant</p>
