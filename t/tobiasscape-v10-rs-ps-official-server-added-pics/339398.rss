Please leave a comment what you think or suggestions :P

After being in with the private server community for about 3 or 4 years, I have a fair idea of what players want and what makes a good server, I was going to write a server guides with guidelines for people, but knowing this community, an epic base would be much more appealing :)

Keep an eye out...

Very latest updates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;-[b]NEW SHOPS! If there is a shop with an npc&#39;s name in its title/name, that npc will automatically open that shop (no editing of client.java required!)[/b]
-Added Fish stall, for stealing noted raw fish, shark being hardest to get obviously, and requiring 90+ thieving to steal from.
-Updated market guards so you can still steal from the stall while they attack you, I always found it annoying in real rs the way it stopped you thieving automatically.
-Bought vps [1.5gigabyte] for beta testing, and fixed up an auto restarter, downloaded taskkill.exe to server folder as computer doesn&#39;t have it.
-Made a folder in config/ called &#39;autospawn&#39;, inside 1.cfg, 2.cfg, 0.cfg all containing autospawns, the reason I do this is to prevent corruption and reduce npc related lag to a minimum.
-Made a ::playersinring command, which counts the amount of players in the boxing ring, and tells the player.
-Modified NPC drops system so you can use the name of the npc instead of the ID
-Men drop random pieces of iron armour, one lobster and rarely pieces of the rock-shell armour
-Farmers hit very fast (almost double normal attacking speed), and hit up to 8, and drop 1-50k when they die.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Slightly older updates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;-Based off devo 2.7
-All bugs fixed
-Lagg reduced
-New command system
-New item equipping slot system (uses item names instead of ids!) (.cfg files for each slot)
-Full stall guards working (only aggressive when you try to steal from stall and your less than
two squares away)
-Completley new farming with mithril seeds
-Rewrote thieving, new, fresh, simple base with no handler
-Added boxing ring, with new entering/leaving method, and all proper corners and floors
in right place, lighting is correct on the ring also.
-Added many weapon effects with graphics
-Fixed purple sweets
-Added otherworldy being fully, uses black spell
-Fixed NPC hitting
-Fixed up projectiles
-New NPC drops system in NPCHandler.java, simpler, handier and more fun to use.
-Added better command system in CustomCommand.java, saves way more space and less hassle.
-Added full menu system from winterLove, only because there is no better alternative.
-Added rough doors, dissappear when you click them. (isDoor() - client.java)
-Modified aggressive NPCs to make code which forces a npc to attack a player
-Added chaos druids effect, casts snare at you
-Fixed up prayer a bit
-Added ::barrages AMOUNT command
-Added permenant npc spawning command with walking abilities.
-Added easy membership from czar, because it is the easiest to use option, not yet inter-
grated fully, although its easy.
-Moved npcConfig into the config folder, to make it easier as you can edit all config
files in one place
-Added weild_requirements.cfg, where you can change the requirements to weild an item
using the item&#39;s name, instead of id, again saving time.
-Done most big fix tutorials on google and moparscape.
-Fixed up bank
-Added a wide range of items to be stole from the stalls in ardougne
-Fixed up pnpc system and added a command ::pnpc NPCID (transforms you into a npc)
-Fixed up woodcutting/firemaking
-Added itemValue, to return the value of a given item
-Ghosts added which cast spell and drop random ghostly robes and 1-5k
-Added global objects, and added to packet 210 in addition to 121 to spawn faster 
and reduce lagg.
-Full normal and chocolate cakes :P
-Fully working tower guards which actually fire arrows with their bow!
-Fixed Thieving stall guards, changed distance from 1 square to 2, so if your standing 2 squares away, but still at the stall, you are no longer safe
-Prevented leaving the boxing ring while in combat
-Boxing gloves go into the &#39;gloves&#39; slot, and if you wear them while in the boxing ring, you lose all items when you die, if not, the boxing ring is a fun p-king zone.
-Reduced market guards max hit from 8 to 4, as it was simply too high for new players with 10 hp
-Purple sweets now stackable!
-Removed all daggers from the shields list, and restored the dragon dagger special 
-Fixed ::gfx ID, ::emote ID
-Added some new fun commands, such as ::demon, which transforms player into demon and sets walking and standing emote to the correct demon stance 
-Wearing a rogue mask prevents you from getting caught stealing by the market guards!
-Market guards now drop 1-7.5k and a random item of the steel armour set.
-Added ::object, which will either work as ::object ID FACE TYPE, or just ::object TYPE (uses default face=0 and type=10), spawns global object.
-Purple sweets now heal a random of, 1-10hp! (more luck involved), game will also tell you how much HP they healed each time in sendMessage.
-Updated baking stall to only give one purple sweet randomly, and silk stall only to give a random cash amount between 1-10k
-Fixed up market guards, do not glitch any more when you run away from them! (finally perfect market guards!)
-Added sigbert&#39;s adventurer shop outside bank, sells whip for 1.4m, rogue mask for 2.2m, mithril seeds for 1k each and full enchanted.
-Added buy x, only up to 100 though
-Fixed up door opening system, can now open diagonal doors too!

To come:
-Fishing
-Fixing up cooking completley, removing handler and reducing amount of code greatly.
-Man slaughter minigame, with tonnes of aggressive low level npcs
[s]-Choice to lose or keep items in boxing ring[/s] (boxing gloves on/off)
-Summon npcs to help you in combat only (no stupid following :D)
-Alch all items in inventory
-Bank all items in inventory mabye
-Mabye a few dungeons for training/exploring
-Possibly ice pking dungeon (mining area of blurite dungeon)
[s]-5 second timer to leave boxing ring, and can&#39;t leave in combat[/s]
-Loads of beta testing
-Transformation?
-Fletching
-NPCs randomly drop crystal keys which can be used on a chest to gain a reward 
(alternative to clue scrolls)
-Modified barrows (not in the tunnels the brothers are usually in)
-Dragons and fully working anti dragonfire shield
-Big scary skeletons
-[s]Fish stal[/s]l, (with a better guard?), [s]which you can steal random noted fish from (to save inventory space)[/s]
-A crate or something which allows you to turn items in your inventory into gold :) (how much they are worth) (alching without magic)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>Thanks, but saying good luck is still supporting me in a way, whats the difference between you supporting and not supporting? I don’t understand lmao.<br>
Please give reasons so I can improve, i’m trying to make the server as fun as possible, and it will work on any client basically.</p>
