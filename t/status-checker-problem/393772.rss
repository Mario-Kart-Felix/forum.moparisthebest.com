    <title>Status checker problem?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/status-checker-problem/393772</link>
    <description>Hi i recently started hosting my first 525, and its been on 3 different status checkers since  5-1-11, and it has been at 100% on all three..... All of a sudden today for about 10 mins mopar said my server was offline while the other 2(not named) said it was online. Now my servers at 99% on mopar alone while at 100% on other two. Now i was on first mopar page this morning and now im on third. i hate to complain about 1% but my playerbase isn&#39;t large enough to satisfy me and being on the third page will attract less. will it go back to 100% if it stays online? if not what are my options? Sorry for complaining for something so little.
