    <title>HTML games</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/html-games/408531</link>
    <description>well i used to play runescape and runescape private servers and i havent been online for like a year but i just had a thought off the top off my head - maybe, and don&#39;t get me wrong, i don&#39;t actually know if it has been done but we could make games with html, no flash, java or any other stuff just plain old html :P i think it woud be a laugh: the games would be simple, board or say gravity games like &quot; The impossible game &quot; for example. As i have said i think we should get a couple of people into a group and maybe take into account each others ideas and then produce games. you dont need to be like the GOD of html but you need to know the basic base codes and pretty much how to produce line breaks and titles like
[code]&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; and so on...[/code]

I&#39;m not doing this for sure, but if we get enough people together say 5-10 people then im sure it would work, post your comments and tell me what you think, but as i have said already it was an idea of the top of my head.

thanks for reading

              <p>If you were to implement javascript in your HTML code, then it would be much easier.  I don’t know if you can make a game with just HTML <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
