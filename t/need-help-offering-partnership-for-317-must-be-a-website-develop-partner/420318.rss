    <description>Hello my name is Sebastian, i&#39;m currently planning to start up &quot;my&quot; personal Runescape private server (317), the reason why i&#39;m doing the &quot;&quot; is that i need a Website owner/develop partner to simply set up a website and all the private server features. Since this is mostly my project i&#39;ll be paying the host and buying the domain, just so the copyright gets right in place so am not gonna end up getting a case on my own neck. unless youre already running a site and wanted to gain more more running a rsps client, we just switch domain or something. anyways that is basically it if youre interested plese reply to this topic telling a little about youre personality (age) (gender) (some pictures of your previous work) and so else add me on skype: &quot;sdfl-sabbi&quot; for more information and pictures (i am coding the source i have been working on this source for 2-3 months and its about to be ready i think its preatty cool its not a custom shetty source with all that. no its kind of neutral nice to play and great economy. ask questions and if you wonder if it has alot of issues i&#39;d say no its completely clean and nice to play on. everything works exept for a few things which never has been created by any coder doing rsps. skype: &quot;sdfl-sabbi&quot;</description>
