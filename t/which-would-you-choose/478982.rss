    <title>Which would you choose?</title>

    <description>atheist disclaimer: this theory does involve God

when you die, God gives you two choices:

you could either be transformed into an ever-burning star, cast out into the abyss of the universe forever lost in your existence, knowing that there was a life after death, and that there is a God, and that any other questions will remain unanswered. you&#39;re just there...forever (arguably hell)

or you can choose to be destroyed (unconscious) until the end of time; then the beginning of time starts again and you are to live the same eternity over and over, living, dying, and meeting God. anything you did in your life remains unchanged.

these are some pretty terrible fates ;\</description>
