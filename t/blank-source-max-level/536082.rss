    <title>Blank Source Max Level</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/blank-source-max-level/536082</link>
    <description>[s]Hey Moparss, I have a question..
I use a 317 Blank source and this is what happens : 
I changed the max level to 99 but still it is possible to reach lvl 100?
I used a tutorial for this so maybe he/she didn&#39;t explain it well so here is what i changed : In Source/client.java i changed  &quot;for (int lvl = 1; lvl &lt;= 100; lvl++) { &quot; to &quot;for (int lvl = 1; lvl &lt;= 99; lvl++) { &quot; But still he is reaching lvl 100 and yes I used the compiler and yes he said there was no problem.. I hope someone could help me, it is not necessary at the moment but I want it fixed so fast as possible.. Thanks for reading =D[/s]

Fixed it!!</description>
