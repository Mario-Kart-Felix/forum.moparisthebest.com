    <title>Opinions on Facial Recognition Software?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/opinions-on-facial-recognition-software/324750</link>
    <description>Currently I just bought a webcam, a Microsoft LifeCam cinema hd was has support for 720p, and I must say it is one of the best webcam&#39;s I have ever seen. Owning 2 other microsoft webcams that performed like shit versus competitors such as Logitech I really enjoy this camera alot and my grandparents enjoy seeing me clearly 1,200 miles away.

My dell monitor that I bought, the SX2210, came bundled with drivers and facial recongition software.( Fast Access by Sensible Vision ). Before the webcam that was built into the monitor did not work well with this software, it could take up to a couple minutes to recongize my face, but now that I have boughten a better webcam that supports higher resolutions and is clearer, as soon as I walk into the viewing range and it detects a face, it immeditaley recongizes me. This was suprising considering I assumed the software was shit and so did everyone else that rates facial recongition software. 

So what im trying to ask is have you guys every used facial recongition software, and if you have what was your opinions about it?</description>

There is a video of someone putting the same HP camera to the test on a black person, proving it is real.  The camera only works on black people if there is a lot of lighting, the dark skin makes the detection of the facial features hard I suppose.[/quote]<br>
If you haven’t realized yet that it’s obviously fake you must be one dumbass.</p>

lol @ them not realizing its fake[/quote]</p>
<p>Its fake how, the youtube video looks legit?</p>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="t4DT3tQqgRM" data-youtube-title="HP computers are racist" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>
<p>besides this kind of software is looking for a face rather than doing that + anazlying the biometrics.<br>
Don’t you have to set up a facial profile first so the cameraa knows what it is looking for?</p>
