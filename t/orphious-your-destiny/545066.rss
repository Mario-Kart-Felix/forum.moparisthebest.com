[CENTER]Hello everyone and welcome to my new thread, the reason i am making a new thread is because the person that our team was working with was an asshole and said that &#39;inferno&#39; was his, but don&#39;t you worry. I still have the project completely up to date. He has the old server files, the one that he made no changes to. So lets get on with the details shall we :)[/CENTER]

[HR]
[CENTER]Orphious is a private server that has a lot of unique content. Most of our content is and will be written from scratch.

[HR]
[CENTER]This is an economy server. The economy will be well structured and balanced out. We will bring you completely flawless PvP and PvM. When beta will be released we will have most of out skills working. There will be many bosses in our server. This will include Godwar bosses, King black dragon, Chaos Elemental and much more. Skilling will be one main key to bringing items into the world of Orphious; As our shops do not contain a lot of the equipment you require, We are still deciding upon which experience rates will be the best for out players. Please, Vote in the poll what your favorite experience rates will be. We will have a lot of quests to offer you; many will be from runescape and many will be custom because in my opinion custom quests make it better because nobody will know how to do them at the start. Please continue to our next section

<p>good luck btw[/quote]</p>
<p>thanks and dont worry, when i do most skills ill write a boss system, and i mean, this will be like a really epic system, not shitty bosses, bosses that hit 59999999</p>
<p>joke bosses that actually do different styles, spawn npcs, make gfx spots that damage you if your are standing on them, freeze, stun, basically what pvmers look for <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

[CENTER]Hello everyone and welcome to my new thread, the reason i am making a new thread is because the person that our team was working with was an asshole and said that ‘inferno’ was his, but don’t you worry. I still have the project completely up to date. He has the old server files, the one that he made no changes to. So lets get on with the details shall we :)[/CENTER]<br>

[CENTER]Orphious is a private server that has a lot of unique content. Most of our content is and will be written from scratch.<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/XRzu95p.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
[/CENTER]<br>
[HR]<br>
[CENTER]This is an economy server. The economy will be well structured and balanced out. We will bring you completely flawless PvP and PvM. When beta will be released we will have most of out skills working. There will be many bosses in our server. This will include Godwar bosses, King black dragon, Chaos Elemental and much more. Skilling will be one main key to bringing items into the world of Orphious; As our shops do not contain a lot of the equipment you require, We are still deciding upon which experience rates will be the best for out players. Please, Vote in the poll what your favorite experience rates will be. We will have a lot of quests to offer you; many will be from runescape and many will be custom because in my opinion custom quests make it better because nobody will know how to do them at the start. Please continue to our next section</p>
