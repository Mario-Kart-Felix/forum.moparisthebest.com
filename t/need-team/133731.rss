    <description>Ok so I have an Idea for a great game. The only problem s I need a developement team to help me. This is far from a one person project and I would like to know who is interested. Once the game is finished, copies will be sold online for 10-40$&#39;s a piece on many different websites. If the project works out alrighte then of course everyone will get there share of the money.

I am currently working on finishing the plans and the corporate website. The website will be strictly for the teams eyes only. It will be password protected as well. If you are caught showing any part of our plans to anyone outside of the team you will be fined a fee of $300.00.

<p>Well, he stated his opinion.  And an opinion isn’t fact.  He didn’t say that “No one that ‘owns’ and RS private server could make anything decent.”  He said “i seriously cant trust that you will be making a good game when you apparently own a rs private server” which can’t be proven wrong.</p>

<p>(yes yes i agree to keep all plans and documens safe.)</p>
<p>Tell us about yourself:<br>
Which Job are you interested in: 3D Graphic editors as a texture artist. I’ve got 3 years experience with photoshop as a graphic designer and texture artist. Texture artist skills include low-high poly normal map baking, creation in specular and diffuse maps. as well as UVW mapping with a Wacom graphire 6x8 tablet.</p>
<p>My skinning talent resides in non-organic models (preferably props and environmental). Sorry that i don’t have any portfolio online yet.</p>
<p>and if you don’t mind me asking. what engine is this going to be in?</p>
<p>and i’d rather not give out my name and adress unless this project actually reaches its final stages. and i still doubt that you’ll be able to sell. some mods turn out better than standalone games. i.e dystopia, insurgency, and counter-strike (at one point).</p>
