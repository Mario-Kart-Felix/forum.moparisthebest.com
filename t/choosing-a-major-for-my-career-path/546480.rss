    <title>Choosing a Major for My Career Path</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/choosing-a-major-for-my-career-path/546480</link>
    <description>I think there are a lot of people here that can provide some solid advice for me.

I want to become a game developer and make it my career. When I say &quot;developer&quot;, I mean programmer, NOT a game artist. I originally was going to major in Computer Science to do this, so I could give myself programming experience and a good plan B.

However, I need to take Calculus I and II for this major, which is something I&#39;m horrible at, and there&#39;s also the fact that a CS major is so general for a game developer that if I wanted to work at a big game company, it wouldn&#39;t be as impressive as say, and Interactive Media Studies major that focuses solely on game development.

Anyways, I was thinking of switching my major from CS to IMS to focus more saliently on game development. Is anyone on a similar path and could maybe give some advice for me? Thanks in advance.</description>

<p>My advice is to take a community college and knock out your core classes and then decide your career and transfer to a decent university, if you haven’t started college yet. My sister did this and she majors in pharmaceutical and didn’t cost much at all.  The community college offered free tutoring online via video chat. They get paid to help you, and that’s what they will do. Sorry it’s not advice on choosing a major but hopefully it gives you something.</p>

<p>0/10 would not recommend.</p>
<p>You have to get real lucky to get teachers at a community college who actually give a fuck about you. I went to one of the most well known community colleges and my experience sucked ass and I did not keep anyone from there. IF you have the money to afford all of the expenses, go to a university. Chances are you are going to get a better experience all around, plus you will be able to make connections that will last for 4 years instead of 2 years AND if you’re living close to campus/on campus you will be able to attend more clubs and it will be more convenient.</p>
<p>As much as it sucks to admit it, 80% of getting a job is who you know. Yes knowing your shit is important, but if you don’t make strong connections with both staff and peers it will be much harder to land a job you want, especially in today’s job market. Also, it will be easier to get recommendation letters if you want to continue your education. Pick a couple teachers that are relevant to your field and take them repeatedly, and introduce yourself the first day. It might feel weird just going up and saying “hello, I just wanted to introduce myself.” Let them know you’re highly interested in the field and their class.</p>

Sure, but a potential employer is definitely going to want to see your past work/code. It is definitely a great idea to start building your portfolio and github presence now. One major thing they like to see is that you can just jump into an existing code base and feel at home. Contributing to open source projects is a great way to show this.</p>
<p>Good luck with your major though, you can always change it later.</p>

<p>If you can’t handle Calc I think that answers your question whether or not CS is for you, tbh. Discrete math is much harder than calc, imo</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It honestly angers me that Calc is a prerequisite for it. I’ve never used calculus in any programming I’ve done, and I’ve done quite a lot.</p>
<p>Anyways, I didn’t want to give off the vibe that I did. I’m not asking how to become a better programmer; I’m talking about a major that’s right for me. For anyone interested I did drop the CS major and went for an Integrative Media Studies major, because that focuses exclusively on game development if I so desire. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> I guess I’m throwing all my eggs into doing my dream now, so wish me luck! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also I’m not stupid enough to rely solely on mopar for advice. I’ve talked with my academic advisors until we’re blue in the face, it’s just that they aren’t programmers like a lot of people here. Just wanted some help. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>I know this is a shocking concept that is obviously not thought of in modern day society, but they have this idea that if you practice something, you will learn it.</p>
<p>Colleges offer ample opportunity to succeed. Open lab hours, free tutoring, etc.</p>
<p>Do CS, join clubs that relate to video games development. If one does not exist, create it. Now you look even better on job resumes, plus don’t have a shitty major.</p>
<p>Apply yourself and it will workout</p>

              <p>I think there are a lot of people here that can provide some solid advice for me.</p>
<p>I want to become a game developer and make it my career. When I say “developer”, I mean programmer, NOT a game artist. I originally was going to major in Computer Science to do this, so I could give myself programming experience and a good plan B.</p>
<p>However, I need to take Calculus I and II for this major, which is something I’m horrible at, and there’s also the fact that a CS major is so general for a game developer that if I wanted to work at a big game company, it wouldn’t be as impressive as say, and Interactive Media Studies major that focuses solely on game development.</p>
<p>Anyways, I was thinking of switching my major from CS to IMS to focus more saliently on game development. Is anyone on a similar path and could maybe give some advice for me? Thanks in advance.</p>
