    <title>CreepyPasta&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creepypastas/515875</link>
    <description>Most have heard of them. You can find them on it&#39;s wiki (Link below).
I did some research on this one for Spongebob. The episode is called &quot;Red Mist&quot; [Links available on request].
While watching one of the many (this one supposedly the real one) of the remakes/etc of it. I found something that just f[b][/b]ucked with me. I freeze framed the video perfectly before a static, and the image I got shows two people (Girl and guy???) side by side. Possibly one in the middle of them. This makes me think the first video I watched about this was true.
I don&#39;t know if CreepyPasta&#39;s are real or not, or just some made up bull on the internet. Or a mix of both.
Here&#39;s the screenie I happen to get:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/UEQiQRL.png[/img]

Yes, you can see my email, and a very very tiny image of me. I don&#39;t care.

Here&#39;s the topic to discuss:
Are CreepyPasta&#39;s real, fake, or both? Evidence would be nice.

              <p>Pokemon creepy pastas are always interesting, I always wished at least the stuff about lavender town was real but unfortunately it’s all been debunked. Pokemon has a lot of potential to be some really effed up shiznit, but sadly they stick to little kid games and movies.</p>

              <p>I love creepypastas, but they fucked me up something good in 8th grade and I couldn’t sleep right for a long time, and probably failed a class for it. I usually just hang around <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">/r/nosleep</a>, and there’s some really well written stories there.</p>
<p>In my opinion, they’re as real as you want them to be. I think they’re just (sometimes) well written stories by clever authors (hell, Jadusable admitted Ben Drowned was fake, and there’s still people who swear by their life that he’s lying, or “possessed” by Ben).</p>

              <p>Literally, once you’ve read one creepy-pasta you’ve pretty much read them all. Pokemon Black and the Zelda Majora’s Mask one are the most popular and pretty much every one following has a very similar story. They’re pretty entertaining if done well though. This guy does a very good job narrating them, and is quite funny too. I’d recommend checking him out.</p>

The story behind “red mist” is that some interns of Nickelodeon Studios walked into a room to view the video of this episode, and they found a really really demented version of it, none like a usual episode. Backlogs said it was edited 24 seconds before it was watched.</p>
