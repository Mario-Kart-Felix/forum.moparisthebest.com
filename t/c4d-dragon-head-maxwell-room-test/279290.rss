    <title>[C4D] Dragon Head &amp; Maxwell Room Test</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/c4d-dragon-head-maxwell-room-test/279290</link>
    <description>I havent posted anything in a while, so why i was killing a black dragon in rs... :).... , i thought about trying to make a dragon. I was surprised how nice it looked (Figuring it would&#39;ve looked worse  :P). I may continue this one but maybe not. Also, the reason i haven&#39;t kept you updated on my Motorcycle was because the 42 day period for R11 ran out, and there is no way i can work on it and save it anymore. I really don&#39;t enjoy keeping C4D open forever either  :rolleyes:

Well here&#39;s the dragon head:

If the DOF bothers you ill re-render it later on.


Now for Maxwell...
          I have heard of maxwell and lately i was wanting to try it. Im still debating in my mind if Maxwell is more worth my time than VRay. So far i have loved the renders it gives but with a lengthy time  :(.  Im still learning how to make textures but here&#39;s one of my test renders on a wood floor i made:

If i do decide to go with Maxwell, which i most likely will, i will start off with a room because i haven&#39;t made one in a while and maxwells powerful rendering will make me eager  :)
