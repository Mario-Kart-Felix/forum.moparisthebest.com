<p>Its obvious you shouldn’t predict what I am going to say otherwise you wouldn’t have started this, but in a 508 files and code in files are found in different places and someone who hasn’t used a source above the 317 revision will not know where to find anything they need.  So since he has no knowledge of a 508 source yet he will not know this and in turn it will be hard for him to code and like he said, he will need to learn it.

<p>Take it from a guy who’s gone through all the files of almost every revision. 317’s files are located in different places then in 508s, 525s, 562s, etc.</p>
<p>Also there are different files, such as basically everything to do with npcs spawning in 1 location is handeled in spawn-npc,java or something’s name similar to that, while in 562s everything to do with npc spawning is handled in npc.xml.</p>
<p>There is also different setups in both npc files.</p>
<p>This is just an example ^.</p>

<p>You de-repped me implying that rep matters. It doesn’t.</p>

<p>Most noob coders think that. Don’t be a freaking asshole about it and just simply tell him that to just learn how to code with java, instead of being an asshole.</p>

<p>He insulted my programming ability. I of course with my big ego, had to put him down a few notches. We already corrected it and it was all fine but then Mirr or whatever the hell his name is had to be a tool about it.</p>
<p>Shutup Judo. You don’t know what you’re talking about.<br>
[/quote]<br>
the ignorance flowing from your body right now is insulting to mankind… and what did you “correct”?  You respond to his post saying you used a ritzscape source and fucked up on it by calling him a moron and talking to him as if he has a mental disability.  Sorry i didnt allow you to make fun of him without having me say something.</p>

This just proves how retarded the RitzScape community is. Nigscape sucks, quit trying to make it seem like it is a new game or some shit. Horrible Delta. Complete shit.</p>
<p>If you are going to release a once great server, make it like it was when it was great. This is the ritzscape with that retard Jamie “coding npcs [and shit] to the highest possible standards”. Shouldn’t be too hard.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>said from the person that made his own ritzscape source. and the name didnt even work! lol, the usernames got cut off!. ffs[/quote]</p>
<p>Spent like 5 minutes on that piece of shit. Learned alot since then. Working on a Hyperion 474, not even sure you know what that is.</p>
