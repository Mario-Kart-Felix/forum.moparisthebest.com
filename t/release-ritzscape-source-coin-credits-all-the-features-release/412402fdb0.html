<p>wow‚Ä¶ Since you cant understand what was said before‚Ä¶ I am talking to you about not being a complete asshole when there is no need for it.  Like I have already said, there wasn‚Äôt anything to be corrected, I also don‚Äôt think we should continue this conversation if you aren‚Äôt capable of keeping up with what has been currently said.</p>

Its obvious you shouldn‚Äôt predict what I am going to say otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt have started this, but in a 508 files and code in files are found in different places and someone who hasn‚Äôt used a source above the 317 revision will not know where to find anything they need.  So since he has no knowledge of a 508 source yet he will not know this and in turn it will be hard for him to code and like he said, he will need to learn it.

<p>Take it from a guy who‚Äôs gone through all the files of almost every revision. 317‚Äôs files are located in different places then in 508s, 525s, 562s, etc.</p>
<p>Also there are different files, such as basically everything to do with npcs spawning in 1 location is handeled in spawn-npc,java or something‚Äôs name similar to that, while in 562s everything to do with npc spawning is handled in npc.xml.</p>
<p>There is also different setups in both npc files.</p>
<p>This is just an example ^.</p>

<p>Okay, so the packaging is different between a 317 and a 508+. Shouldn‚Äôt be a problem if someone uses an IDE.
