    <description>Freestyle soccer is really cool if you can perform combos, or even just juggle. I&#39;m pretty much an expert at juggling, and I can do a couple tricks, including a neck stall(only after a couple times), and I can also do a spin. If you&#39;re good at freestyle soccer, feel free to post ;)
Heres a couple definitions of a few tricks.

&quot;Spin&quot; (Spin) is a pretty easy trick when you get used to it. You kick the ball into the air, maybe 7 feet or so, spin, and then when the ball comes down you stall or juggle.

&quot;Around the World&quot; (ATW) is also popular; in this move, the player plays the ball off of one foot, and that foot then circles up and over the ball before before returning underneath to play the ball again.

&quot;Stall&quot; moves involve catching the ball in a stationary position. Many freestylers are able to catch the ball on their foreheads, the backs of their necks, or wedged between their heel and the back of their thigh.

&quot;Combos&quot; are where one trick is connected to another without juggling the ball. For example a combo could be:
ATW - ATW - Hop the World (HTW) - Touzani Around the World (TATW) - HTW - Mitchy Around the World (MATW).</description>

<p>lol. run-on sentence.<br>
And American football can carry around 46 players on their team at a time, whereas Soccer (European football) can only carry a max of 18, and each sport only allows 11 on the field at a time.  Soccer players would run circles around those fat lards, yet Soccer in the U.S. is still considered “beaner sport”. heh.</p>

I mean, in soccer (british football) you dont stop playing every 15 seconds, you dont wear pads, and you dont sit on the sidelines huffing and puffing every 4 plays.  But then again, rugby is waayy more brutal than both British football and american football, but I dont play that.</p>

              <p>This isn’t really ‘freestyle soccer’ as you like to define it.  But I guess you can call is whatever you want.  I would say this is just juggling with style.</p>
<p>And I do most of these in games, but only when possible.  Stalling helps alot, because lets say somebody lobs a ball to you and you want to control it.  You slow it down so by the time it reaches the ground, it has stopped in front of you, allowing for a shot.</p>
<p>As for a ‘spin’, I don’t think 7 feet is necessary.  What I do when somebody is on my back, is give it a kick over my shoulder or to one side, spin around the guy, then bring it back into my possession.</p>

              <p>Freestyle soccer is really cool if you can perform combos, or even just juggle. I’m pretty much an expert at juggling, and I can do a couple tricks, including a neck stall(only after a couple times), and I can also do a spin. If you’re good at freestyle soccer, feel free to post <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Heres a couple definitions of a few tricks.</p>
<p>“Spin” (Spin) is a pretty easy trick when you get used to it. You kick the ball into the air, maybe 7 feet or so, spin, and then when the ball comes down you stall or juggle.</p>
<p>“Around the World” (ATW) is also popular; in this move, the player plays the ball off of one foot, and that foot then circles up and over the ball before before returning underneath to play the ball again.</p>
<p>“Stall” moves involve catching the ball in a stationary position. Many freestylers are able to catch the ball on their foreheads, the backs of their necks, or wedged between their heel and the back of their thigh.</p>
<p>“Combos” are where one trick is connected to another without juggling the ball. For example a combo could be:<br>
ATW - ATW - Hop the World (HTW) - Touzani Around the World (TATW) - HTW - Mitchy Around the World (MATW).</p>
