    <description>Hey guys, when I jar my client, then run it, it works like a dream! But then I go onto another computer, or have a friend try it, and they get &quot;A java exception has occurred.&quot; How do I fix this? What am I doing wrong? I can&#39;t for the life of me find the solution to this. I googled it and found nothing, but I did find this picture, this is exactly what pops up on other peoples ends. My end opens the client just fine. I also have signed the jar. So I am not sure what to do....</description>
