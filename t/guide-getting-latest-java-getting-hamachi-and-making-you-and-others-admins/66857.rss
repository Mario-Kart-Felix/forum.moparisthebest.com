    <description>*Guide On How To Get The Latest Java, Hamachi, And Making You And Others Admins On Your Server*

This is a simple guide on how to make you and others admins on your server.

Notice: Each section is numbered so you can easily navigate the things you need

[b]Table of Contents:[/b]
#1-Getting JDK 6.0 (Latest Java)
#2-Compiling and running your server
#3-Hamachi (If needed)
#4-Making you and others admins
#5-Finishing up
---------------------
[b][size=10pt]#1-Getting The Latest Version Of Java[/size][/b]
     If you are wondering, &quot;Why do I need the latest version of Java?&quot; Well, the answer is because you need a backup base to play MoparScape because the Java you are using now, if its not the latest, doesn&#39;t compile with the older versions, so therfore, you need the latest.
     The latest version can be found here: [url=http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp]http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp[/url] You need to accept the liscense agreements and terms of service in order to succesfully download. Downloads can take from seconds to minutes. You need JDK 6.0 and you need the language you are related to (English,Spanish,Hungrian,Etc.). 
     Once you have the latest Java, you shouldn&#39;t have to do anything. It will run in your system every time you have something running with java!

[b][size=10pt]#2-Compiling and Running Your Server[/size][/b]
    Within where you saved your source or however you got your source, you will find 2 windows within the server source folder saying either compile,cimpile.bat, or anything compile named window. Second, you will find another window icon that has either runserver.bat,runserver, or anything runserver named. These two important windows are almost like the brain of the server, besides the client.java. Anyways, if you would like to run your server, double click on compile and wait for a confirmation of when your server is completley compiled. They usually say for example: Path could not be specified... Loading PimpScape Server on 0.0.0.34 or whatever. So, after compiling, do the same with the runserver icon by double clicking and waiting on your server to be confirmed. Important: Once you get the confirmation for COMPILING, close the window it brings up, once you do runserver, minimize it so it will keep your server running! If you would like to shut down your server, then close out of the window the runserver brings up.

[b][size=10pt]#3-Hamachi (If you want)[/size]     [/b] 
    Hamachi, if you want a Hamachi server, you will find a download at [url=http://logmeinhamachi.com]logmeinhamachi.com[/url]. It simply is another hooking-in to servers that sometimes allows as rumors say &quot;less lag&quot;. You can get it if you want. After downloading and accepting liscense agreements and TOS (Terms of Service), it will bring you an icon on your desktop which you will start up and it will bring you with a starter tutorial. Simply follow the tut and then click the power button on the lower left side of the Hamachi window. This powers up your connector with servers around the world! If you want to join a server, click the button that looks like a triangle on the lower right side of the Hamahci window and fill out the info needed. 

[b][size=10pt]#4 Making You And Others Admins[/size][/b]
    This part is very simple. Go to your server source folder and look into the character folder and search whosever member you wish to make an admin. Find their file, double click on it, and search to about the 5th line or so and you will discover a player rights label. If it is zero, then change it to 1 for moderator, 2 for admin, and 3 for server owner. You don&#39;t have to have level 3, but it&#39;s fine if you do. Here is what the label should look like surrounded by other info in the character info.
[code]
[ACCOUNT]
character-username = p hat boy
character-password = covered for personal information

[CHARACTER]
character-height = 0
character-posx = 3253
character-posy = 3422
character-rights = 2
character-ismember = 1
character-messages = 0
character-lastconnection = Covered for Personal info
character-lastlogin = 20070020
character-energy = 100
character-gametime = 0
character-gamecount = 9013
[/code]
    Then, go to file at the window and click save then exit out. After that, you should update, or &quot;Compile&quot; your server to make the changes you just saved. Then, after compiling, run your server and you should be an admin.
    It should look like this on a server when you type and if you&#39;re an admin you&#39;ll see this:

[b][size=10pt]#5-Finishing Up[/size][/b]
    After completing all of the above, you and your server should be good to go. You shouldn&#39;t have any problems with anything. If you do have problems, visit my help sticky in the MoparScape Questions Section of these forums, and I&#39;ll answer any problems you have there. Please notify me that when you ask your question, that it is related to this topic so I can get back with you as quickly as I can. I am glad to help anyone and I hope this topic has helped many and hope that your server becomes very successful within its time :)

The latest version can be found here: <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a> You need to accept the liscense agreements and terms of service in order to succesfully download.

Once you have the latest Java, you shouldn’t have to do anything. It will run in your system every time you have something running with java!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=10pt]<span class="hashtag">#2-Compiling</span> and Running Your Server[/size]</span><br>
Within where you saved your source or however you got your source, you will find 2 windows within the server source folder saying either compile,cimpile.bat, or anything compile named window. Second, you will find another window icon that has either runserver.bat,runserver, or anything runserver named. These two important windows are almost like the brain of the server, besides the client.java. Anyways, if you would like to run your server, double click on compile and wait for a confirmation of when your server is completley compiled. They usually say for example: Path could not be specified… Loading PimpScape Server on 0.0.0.34 or whatever. So, after compiling, do the same with the runserver icon by double clicking and waiting on your server to be confirmed. Important: Once you get the confirmation for COMPILING, close the window it brings up, once you do runserver, minimize it so it will keep your server running! If you would like to shut down your server, then close out of the window the runserver brings up.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=10pt]<span class="hashtag">#3-Hamachi</span> (If you want)[/size]     </span><br>
Hamachi, if you want a Hamachi server, you will find a download at <a href="http://logmeinhamachi.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">logmeinhamachi.com</a>. It simply is another hooking-in to servers that sometimes allows as rumors say “less lag”. You can get it if you want. After downloading and accepting liscense agreements and TOS (Terms of Service), it will bring you an icon on your desktop which you will start up and it will bring you with a starter tutorial. Simply follow the tut and then click the power button on the lower left side of the Hamachi window. This powers up your connector with servers around the world! If you want to join a server, click the button that looks like a triangle on the lower right side of the Hamahci window and fill out the info needed.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=10pt]<span class="hashtag">#4</span> Making You And Others Admins[/size]</span><br>
This part is very simple. Go to your server source folder and look into the character folder and search whosever member you wish to make an admin. Find their file, double click on it, and search to about the 5th line or so and you will discover a player rights label. If it is zero, then change it to 1 for moderator, 2 for admin, and 3 for server owner. You don’t have to have level 3, but it’s fine if you do. Here is what the label should look like surrounded by other info in the character info.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[ACCOUNT]
character-username = p hat boy
character-password = covered for personal information

[CHARACTER]
character-height = 0
character-posx = 3253
character-posy = 3422
character-rights = 2
character-ismember = 1
character-messages = 0
character-lastconnection = Covered for Personal info
character-lastlogin = 20070020
character-energy = 100
character-gametime = 0
character-gamecount = 9013</code></pre>
<pre><code>Then, go to file at the window and click save then exit out. After that, you should update, or "Compile" your server to make the changes you just saved. Then, after compiling, run your server and you should be an admin.
It should look like this on a server when you type and if you're an admin you'll see this:
Pic Coming Soon!
</code></pre>
