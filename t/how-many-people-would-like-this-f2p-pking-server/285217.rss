    <title>How many people would like this? (F2P PKing server)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-many-people-would-like-this-f2p-pking-server/285217</link>
    <description>[b]Hi[/b]

As the title suggests, I&#39;m posting this to find out what people like in F2P PKing servers. All of your comments, thoughts, and criticism are welcome here.

Finding out what people like in servers would help me to make this server more fun.

So far, I&#39;ve been thinking of making a server of my own. Here are some things you should know:

-The entire landscape, except for the Wilderness and Edgeville, has been turned to water or blackness.
  This picture will give you a general idea of what the new Wilderness will look like. Also, what would you want added to it, and how do you feel about it becoming smaller?
  [img]http://img341.imageshack.us/img341/7839/newwildy5.gif[/img]

-What kind of XP rate would you like? I don&#39;t want it to be too fast or too slow. Perhaps 20-30X would be good? My goal is, 3-4 days for flat 99s.

-F2P-Based, all P2P landscapes, shops, items, NPCs, and spells will be removed (as much as possible)

-Money will primarily be obtained by killing NPCs. Perhaps, chickens will drop 50gp, men will drop 100 gp, guards 200gp, etc. What do you think?

-I was also thinking about making lobsters free, but swordfish would be purchased with gp or PK Points.

-As for the PK Points, what would be some good prices for items?

-All &quot;basic&quot; items for PKing (such as ranged supplies and strength potions) will be in a shop. 

-All armor and weapons up to addy will also be in shop. I want to put r2hs in shop, but rune armor will be obtained from monsters, or from PK Points.

There may be a few things that I forgot to mention :(. I&#39;ll edit my post later if I remember what they are.

Great ideas, but will you restrict all areas from access other than edgeville and the wilderness, or will they be open for exploration?</p>
<p>Also, reduce the experience rates a little bit. A week for flat 99s sounds fair.<br>

<p>A week for flat 99s does sound fair, especially since training will be much easier if you want to make a PB account.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah PBs hopefully will rule on your server, as they should in f2p servers.</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">Hi</span></p>
<p>As the title suggests, I’m posting this to find out what people like in F2P PKing servers. All of your comments, thoughts, and criticism are welcome here.</p>
<p>Finding out what people like in servers would help me to make this server more fun.</p>
<p>So far, I’ve been thinking of making a server of my own. Here are some things you should know:</p>
<p>-The entire landscape, except for the Wilderness and Edgeville, has been turned to water or blackness.<br>
This picture will give you a general idea of what the new Wilderness will look like. Also, what would you want added to it, and how do you feel about it becoming smaller?<br>
<img src="http://img341.imageshack.us/img341/7839/newwildy5.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>-What kind of XP rate would you like? I don’t want it to be too fast or too slow. Perhaps 20-30X would be good? My goal is, 3-4 days for flat 99s.</p>
<p>-F2P-Based, all P2P landscapes, shops, items, NPCs, and spells will be removed (as much as possible)</p>
<p>-Money will primarily be obtained by killing NPCs. Perhaps, chickens will drop 50gp, men will drop 100 gp, guards 200gp, etc. What do you think?</p>
<p>-I was also thinking about making lobsters free, but swordfish would be purchased with gp or PK Points.</p>
<p>-As for the PK Points, what would be some good prices for items?</p>
<p>-All “basic” items for PKing (such as ranged supplies and strength potions) will be in a shop.</p>
<p>-All armor and weapons up to addy will also be in shop. I want to put r2hs in shop, but rune armor will be obtained from monsters, or from PK Points.</p>
<p>There may be a few things that I forgot to mention :(. I’ll edit my post later if I remember what they are.</p>
