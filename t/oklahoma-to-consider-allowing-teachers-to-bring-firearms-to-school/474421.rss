If this goes anywhere I think a lot of states are going to try and follow suit. What are your thoughts on this? I honestly think it&#39;s a load of shit. Kids steal stuff from teachers all the time, and there&#39;s been many events where teachers just go nuts and beat students. I barely trust some of the teachers here to teach a class, much less have a gun in their classroom.</description>

              <p>That’s what I’d do, give a gun to every teacher directly after a school shooting. It will do nothing but guarantee more massacres such as the one that happened last Friday. Not to mention, where would they keep the guns? It’d have to be somewhere that enables quick access, if that’s the case, what’s going to keep the kids from getting their hands on it?</p>

Just because one works for the public doesn’t mean they’re law-abiding citizens that knit all night.  If I wanted to, I could get the licencing required for a gun, whether it be a handgun or an AR-15, get a job driving a school bus, and open fire the next day.  Also, not everyone is mentally stable enough to own a gun, let alone carry one around kids who will inevitably make them mad.  Hell, I’ve seen my teachers get in a shouting match with students, I honestly thought someone would swing in one of them.  Also, not everyone can just pick up a gun and use it.  An example would be the stupid “gangstas” who hold their gun in a crooked-ass way and probably have no knowledge of actually firing a gun.</p>

I think this brings the children up with a really bad mindset. If they found out, they’d be under the impression that in order to be safe, they HAD to have a gun. Hard to say how they would think when they got older.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You do have to have a gun…[/quote]Owning a gun definitely does not make you safe.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@op</span>: I really hope that it does not happen.  Giving teachers the right to carry a firearm in school grounds would definitely not make the children safer.  I would be scared shit-less, and would not even bother showing up to school at times, if my teacher possessed a gun.</p>

that was one of the points i made in the original post. every school i’ve been to here in oklahoma always has an officer on campus. maybe more would be a good idea, but arming the teachers whose obligation isn’t really to confront an intruder isn’t that good of an idea.</p>
