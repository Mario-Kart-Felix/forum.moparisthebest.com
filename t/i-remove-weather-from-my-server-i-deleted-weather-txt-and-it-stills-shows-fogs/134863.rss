              <p>I have the occasional problem with weather but if it ever changes I just change the value back to 0 and it is fine again.<br>
and if you want you can go into client and add an if statment that says if weather isn’t equal to 0 to change it to 0 but I think deleting it isn’t smart</p>
<p>as for the ::rules that would just be a loop.</p>
<p>like…(this is not a real code just an example)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">do{
teleportToX = absX;
teleportToY = absY;
}while(playercommand != rules);</code></pre>
