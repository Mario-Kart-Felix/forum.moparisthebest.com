    <title>Jolt v2: Login Manager Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jolt-v2-login-manager-error/542536</link>
    <description>This error has had me stumped for a good 3+ hours and I don&#39;t quite understand what to do about it.

[code]-- SYSTEM ERROR DETECTED --
System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (0x80004005): An attempt was made to access a socket in a way for
bidden by its access permissions
   at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.DoBind(EndPoint endPointSnapshot, SocketAddress socketAddress)
   at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Bind(EndPoint localEP)
   at System.Net.Sockets.TcpListener.Start(Int32 backlog)
   at RuneScape.Commons.Network.ConnectionListener.Start(Boolean logConnections, Boolean checkBlackl
ist) in C:\Users\AJ\Desktop\jolt v2 final\Source\RuneScape.Commons\Network\ConnectionListener.cs:lin
e 117
   at System.Dynamic.UpdateDelegates.UpdateAndExecuteVoid3[T0,T1,T2](CallSite site, T0 arg0, T1 arg1
, T2 arg2)
   at RuneScape.GameServer.Engine.Initialize()[/code]

While searching, I&#39;ve read that it could be another port open on some other program. I used &quot;netstat - an&quot; in cmd to search for another program using all the ports I&#39;m using and it seems that none are conflicting. I made sure Skype and Teamviewer are not using ports 443 and 80 by changing it in the settings. I also made sure no other appache applications were installed to conflict and still no success. I found it slightly peculiar that [code]C:\Users\AJ\Desktop\jolt v2 final\Source\RuneScape.Commons\Network\ConnectionListener.cs:line 117[/code] the error referenced the previous users file location instead of mine. I&#39;m honestly trying to get this to work to the learning experience and would be greatly appreciative that someone could lend me an insightful eye upon this problem.</description>
